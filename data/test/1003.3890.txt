    "the possible exploration of chemical composition of planets and extraterrestrial materials @xcite by analysis of gamma spectra emitted from the surface , renewed the interest for gamma ray production cross sections in stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "the energy level structure of the stable @xmath2 has been studied extensively in the past via _ inelastic neutron scattering _ ( ins ) @xcite , and pertinent cross sections for the gamma ray production exist @xcite . however , secondary neutrons produced by primary cosmic rays have much higher energies compared to reactor ones and cross sections for gamma ray production by the use of neutrons with energies up to 150  mev were studied recently @xcite .",
    "despite @xmath3 nuclear reaction being well - explored , few publications @xcite report on relative intensities of gamma lines induced by ins on @xmath2 nuclei .",
    "pre - world  war  ii iron is widely used as a passive shield and 846.8  kev gamma line , induced by inelastic scattering of neutrons produced by cosmic muons , is a well - known feature in background spectra @xcite .",
    "even though detailed knowledge of all possible sources of radiation could be of crucial importance in numerous low - background experiments , the gamma radiation due to excitation of @xmath2 nuclei by inelastic scattering of muon - produced neutrons received little attention .",
    "reliable experimental studies @xcite of cross sections for @xmath3 reaction have indicated that detected intensities of gamma lines depend on incident neutron energy , and it is to be expected that the same holds for _ relative _ intensities . indeed , for incident neutron energies between 6.3  mev and 14.2  mev , relative intensity of 1238.3  kev gamma line changes by almost 80% @xcite .",
    "there are several muon - stimulated mechanisms of neutron production with significant contributions to the background @xcite : muon capture , muon - induced spallation reactions , muon - induced hadrons cascades , and photonuclear reactions ( high energy photons from a muon - induced electromagnetic cascade ) . at the earth s surface and shallow depths ,",
    "the dominant neutron production mode is negative muon capture .",
    "this process occurs by stopping muons and plays a significant role @xcite because the mean energy of surface muons is about 4  gev . on the other hand",
    ", the energies of neutrons emitted after muon capture do not exceed several mev @xcite .",
    "high energy muons , also present at earth s surface in much lower arrival numbers , penetrate to the larger depths .",
    "it has been demonstrated through several background measurements in underground laboratories @xcite that the hard muon component may create neutrons with energies up to several hundred mev .",
    "the goal of this paper is to identify characteristic @xmath2 gamma lines in background spectra registered by a iron - shielded hpge detector .",
    "the relative intensities of measured gamma transitions are assessed against published results on the same gamma transitions detected in neutron beam scattering experiments .",
    "we use @xmath4 source to get the qualitative information about the average energy of muon - created neutrons in the iron shield and to infer relative intensities of gamma lines associated with scattering of muon - induced neutrons and fission neutrons .",
    "the hpge detector used in experiments is located in the low - background laboratory of the department of physics in novi sad ( 80  m  amsl ) .",
    "the detector is placed inside a cube chamber made of pre - world  war  ii iron with a useful cube - shaped inner volume of @xmath5 .",
    "iron walls are 25  cm thick and the total mass of the shield is about 20  tons .",
    "no other passive shields were used throughout the measurements .",
    "the distance between the top of the iron shield and 30  cm thick concrete roof construction is about 3  m. iron chamber is placed on concrete base over 2  m away from walls made of bricks and wood . relative efficiency of hpge detector is 25% with the active detection volume of ge crystal being located in the center of the inner volume of the iron cube chamber .",
    "the integral background count rate for energies ranging from 20  kev to 2  mev was about 1 count per second .    to get experimental evidence about relative intensities of gamma lines following de - excitation of @xmath2 nuclei after inelastic scattering of fission neutrons , @xmath4 source ( having stable neutron emission rate of @xmath6 into @xmath7  sr )",
    "was placed at several different positions inside the iron chamber . to attenuate gamma radiation originating from @xmath4 fission products accumulated in source , solid angle of detector as seen from the californium source",
    "was screened by a layer of iron .",
    "measurements were done with uncovered @xmath4 source , as well as with the source packed in 2  cm of paraffin .",
    "in order to explore the gamma radiation produced by the interaction of neutrons with surrounding iron , long time spectra was obtained by the summing a number of background spectra , thus amounting to a total observation time of @xmath8 . the strongest gamma transition in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] is due to 846.8  kev background line with the measured intensity of @xmath9 .",
    "intensities of the remaining three gamma lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] have been normalized to that of 846.8  kev line and are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "variations in detection efficiency , due to different penetration abilities of gamma photons in iron and detector itself , were accounted for at each observed energy with the help of geant4 simulations @xcite . in  the first approximation , it was considered that gamma photons are emitted uniformly from a complete volume of the iron shield .",
    "however , simulations also take into account attenuation of the emitted radiation originating from the part of the iron shield that is shaded by the dewar vessel .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath10 gamma transition in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] occurs at energy that coincides with the background line of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 series member ) at 1238.1  kev .",
    "hence , intensity of @xmath2 1238.3  kev gamma line was inferred by proper decoupling and subtraction of @xmath11 contribution .",
    "namely , nine @xmath11 gamma lines in the energy interval between 609.3  kev and 1764.6  kev were used for proper efficiency calibration of our detector and for deconvolution of the 1238.1  kev @xmath11 portion from the nearby @xmath2 1238.3  kev line profile .",
    "we further note that isolated @xmath2  1810.8  kev gamma line appeared relatively weak in background spectra , whereas another line of interest at 1037.9  kev remained absent .",
    "it is the flat part of the background spectra at the place of the missing 1037.9  kev gamma line that was used in resolving the upper limit for its intensity reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    ".[tab:1 ] relative intensities ( in % ) of gamma transitions depopulating excited states in @xmath2 .",
    "gamma lines were detected both in the background and by the use of californium source ( see text for details ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar procedure was repeated in the case of spectra recorded with @xmath4 source located inside of the iron chamber .",
    "namely , two types of additional measurements were performed : one with uncovered californium source and the other with the source enclosed in 2  cm thick paraffin container .",
    "paraffin moderator was used primarily to reduce the mean energy of fission neutrons emitted by @xmath4 .",
    "the outcome of these measurements showed that relative intensities of @xmath2 gamma lines originating after inelastic neutron scattering do not depend on @xmath4 source position in the chamber .",
    "characteristic times of both measurements were about @xmath13 . in this relatively short period of time , intensities of background @xmath11 lines were much lower than the intensity of lines emitted from @xmath2 excited nuclei and there was no need to subtract a possible contribution due to 1238.1  kev background line .",
    "relative intensities of all three gamma lines of interest obtained in these measurements are also presented in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "part of the energy level scheme of @xmath2 with gamma - ray lines investigated in this work . ]    due to slow - down of neutrons in the paraffin , intensities of the observed gamma lines became significantly lower , however , relative intensities remained similar to those obtained with uncovered @xmath4 source .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] juxtaposes the relative intensities of 1037.9  kev , 1238.3  kev , and 1810.8  kev gamma lines measured in our iron shield with those from neutron beam experiments .",
    "the solid squares denote results of relative intensities of gamma lines obtained in the standard neutron beam experiments .",
    "data for 6.3  mev and 7.3  mev neutrons were published by lachkar  _ et al _",
    "@xcite and 14.2  mev data are due to xiamin  _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "our result acquired by the use of uncovered californium source is also given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] at the adopted mean energy of 2.3  mev for @xmath4 fission neutrons .",
    "the solid horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] represent the values of the relative intensities of gamma lines measured in the background spectra whereas the dashed lines denote a 1-@xmath14 uncertainty corridor .",
    "relative intensities of gamma lines detected both in the background spectra and the spectra measured by the use of @xmath4 source .",
    "results of pertinent gamma transitions obtained in neutron beam measurements at 6.3  mev , 7.3  mev , and 14.2  mev @xcite are shown in solid squares ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "another possible source of gamma radiation emitted from the excited @xmath2 nucleus is the @xmath15 reaction where muon capture occurs without the emission of neutrons .",
    "heisinger  _ et al _  @xcite estimated that about 15.7% of the overall number of muon captures in iron take place through this channel .",
    "the product of the muon capture , @xmath16 , decays to the @xmath2 and we report the relative intensities of three gamma lines of interest in the last column of table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "very weak 1238.3  kev gamma radiation emitted in the decay of @xmath16 suggests that almost all 1238.3  kev photons come from ins at @xmath17 nuclei . relatively strong gamma line of 1810.8  kev is emitted in decay of @xmath16 and it is possible that both processes , inelastic neutron scattering and decay of @xmath16 , contribute jointly to the total count rate under 1810.8  kev gamma peak in the background spectra .",
    "the evidence about possible @xmath16 involvement in measured gamma lines in the background spectra can be obtained by analysis of its high energy part .",
    "one of the strongest gamma lines in decay scheme of @xmath16 has 14.3% intensity and comes from the 2113.2  kev transition depopulating the 2959.9  kev level .",
    "the neutrons created by cosmic muons have insufficient energy to excite the 3122.9  kev level in @xmath17 , and 1037.9  kev gamma line remains unobserved in the background spectra .",
    "one can draw similar conclusion for radiative depopulation of nearby 2959.9  kev level ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "recent measurements by castaneda  _ et al _",
    "@xcite showed that cross sections for neutron induced 1037.9  kev and 2113.2  kev gamma ray production from iron have similar values in broad energy range .",
    "the cross sections for both transitions appear much lower compared to the cross section for production of 846.8  kev gamma transition .",
    "for example , the cross section for 846.8  kev gamma transition at the neutron energy of 6.5  mev is almost fifty times larger than the cross section for the 1037.3  kev and the 2113.2  kev transitions . in this case",
    ", the 2113.2  kev gamma line in the background spectra should originate from the decay of @xmath16 alone .",
    "unfortunately , the upper limit of the background spectra used in this study was 2  mev .",
    "thus , we had new background data accumulated in the extended range of energies with an upper limit slightly over the @xmath18 2614.5  kev gamma line , used here to calibrate the high - energy part of spectrum .",
    "however , this new spectra accrued for @xmath19 also contained no gamma lines at 2113.2  kev .",
    "flat part of continuum , at the place where the 2113.2  kev gamma line should have appeared , can serve as an estimate of possible influence that @xmath16 decay may exert on the overall intensity of the 846.8  kev @xmath17 gamma line .",
    "our measurements show that inelastic scattering of neutrons produced by cosmic muons in @xmath17 can create only three gamma lines : relatively strong 846.8  kev and pair of weak ones , 1238.3  kev and 1810.8  kev .",
    "muon - induced neutrons , as well as fission neutrons , do not produce 1037.9  kev gamma line as this transition de - excites poorly populated 3122.9  kev level .",
    "both types of neutrons , fission as well as cosmic , possess continuous energy distribution .",
    "absence of 1037.9  kev gamma line , both in the background spectra and the spectra collected by the use of californium source , clearly suggest that number of neutrons in the high - energy tail above the 3122.9  kev of both energy distributions is insufficient to produce a measurable number of 1037.9  kev photons .",
    "contrary to our findings , the previously published results shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] and obtained by the use of beams of neutrons at 6.3  mev , 7.3  mev , and 14.2  mev detected up to 10% relative intensity for 1037.9  kev gamma line .",
    "data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for 1238.3  kev gamma line show an apparent increase of relative intensities with different neutron energies between 6.3  mev and 14.2  mev , a trend that can be explained in terms of results reported by savin  _ et al _",
    "namely , the cross section for emission of 846.8  kev normalization line increases at energies below 3.5  mev and remains independent of neutron energy at the higher incident energies . on the other hand ,",
    "cross section for emission of 1238.3  kev photons uniformly increases with the energy of incident neutrons .",
    "the energy threshold for emission of 846.8  kev gamma photons is significantly lower than energy threshold for 1238.3  kev line .",
    "hence , relative intensity of 1238.3  kev gamma line measured in the background spectra ( incapable of exciting 3122.9  kev level ) should be lower than relative intensity measured with neutrons having energies of 6.3  mev and higher .",
    "results presented in fig .  [ fig:2 ] support this argument .",
    "relative intensities of 1810.8  kev gamma line show just opposite tendency from 1238.3  kev case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "it can be explained once again in terms of experimental results of savin  _ et al _",
    "@xcite : the cross section for production of 1810.8  kev photons has maximum at about 4  mev and at higher neutron energies uniformly decreases .",
    "unfortunately , in the background spectra of the present study 1810.8  kev gamma line appears very weak and relative intensities were determined with large statistical uncertainties .",
    "obtained values for relative intensity of 1238.3  kev gamma line , measured both in the background spectra and the spectra induced by a californium source , are mutually compatible ; in both spectra the 1037.9  kev gamma line is missing and relative intensities of 1810.8  kev gamma lines appear consistent within error margins . comparing the results of mannhart  @xcite and schrder  _ et",
    "@xcite , one finds that both fission neutrons and muon - induced neutrons obey similar energy distributions .",
    "further on , compatibility of our measured neutron energy spectra obtained with and without @xmath4 source suggest that the dominant mechanism for neutron production at the earth s surface is due to muon - capture . to get better experimental evidence about possible influence of @xmath16 decay on intensities of gamma lines emitted after neutron scattering in natural iron , intensity of 2113.2  kev gamma line should be acquired in long - time background spectra .",
