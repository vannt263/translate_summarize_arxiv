    "mesoscopic systems belong to one of the most intriguing part of present - day investigations . they occupy territory between physics of small quantum objects and physics of macroscopic objects .",
    "many aspects of that territory remains _ terra incognita _ both to experimentalists and theoreticians .",
    "for example , over one decade after first experiments @xcite proving the existence of the theoretically predicted @xcite persistent currents in normal metal multiply connected samples , there is an unsolved central question : which mechanism is responsible for the unexpectedly large amplitude of the measured current @xcite .",
    "there is a suggestion that the large current is due to _ non - equilibrium _ noise presented in the system @xcite .",
    "it is also theoretically predicted @xcite that currents in mesoscopic rings can flow even in absence of any driving .",
    "self - sustaining _ currents has not been observed so far .",
    "their existence is a desired property for the quantum information retrieval and computing technologies based on non - superconducting devices @xcite .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we proposed the two - fluid model of noisy dynamics of the magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings and cylinders .",
    "dynamics of the magnetic flux is described by an evolution equation which is equivalent to a langevin equation for an overdamped motion of a classical brownian particle and a steady state of the system is characterized by the asymptotic probability density being a stationary solution of the corresponding fokker - planck equation . in this approach ,",
    "self - sustaining fluxes are long living states of the system described by a multistable asymptotic probability density .",
    "this model is an example of a hybrid of quantum and classical parts and is a counterpart of the well known model of a resistively shunted josephson junction @xcite .",
    "the classical part consists of normal electrons carrying dissipative current .",
    "the quantum part is formed by those electrons which maintain their phase coherence around the circumference of the cylinder or ring .",
    "the effective kinetics is determined by a classical langevin equation with a nyquist noise describing thermal equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the coherent part of the system acts as an additional force driving normal electrons .",
    "it is natural to ask what is an impact of quantum nature of dissipative kinetics on the properties of fluxes and currents flowing in such systems . to answer this question , we exploit the so called quantum smoluchowski equation introduced in ref . and , with the maxwell daemon successfully exorcised , in refs .. first",
    ", we extend our model for overdamped kinetics @xcite to the domain where charging effects ( corresponding to the inertial effects for particles ) appear .",
    "this extension is necessary for a precise identification of the quantum smoluchowski regime .",
    "the quantum corrections are of great importance for the existence and properties of self - sustaining currents or magnetic fluxes .",
    "it is shown below that in moderate , with respect to the gap at the fermi level , temperatures these quantum corrections are destructive for their existence .",
    "it is not the case at lower temperature : one gets not only the multistability of the probability density but also significant enhancement of the probability of the occurrence of long living states carrying magnetic flux of a certain amplitude .",
    "it is shown that for the system under consideration the passage from the classical smoluchowski regime into the quantum smoluchowski regime is accompanied with decrease of the shannon entropy .",
    "it emphasizes the significance of the multistable ordered state . as the predicted multistability",
    "is formed by a set of odd number of maxima in the asymptotic probability density it is natural to expect the ring or cylinder to be a candidate for a _ qutrit _ rather than a qubit .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we construct an extended , capacitive model of dissipative magnetic flux dynamics in mesoscopic systems of a cylinder symmetry .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the quantum smoluchowski regime for the system . in sec .",
    "iv , we study properties of the stationary magnetic flux in the quantum smoluchowski domain .",
    "v contains summary and conclusions .",
    "at zero temperature @xmath0 , small metallic systems of the cylinder symmetry ( like rings , toroids and cylinders ) threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath1 display persistent and non - dissipative currents @xmath2 run by coherent electrons . at",
    "non - zero temperature , a part of electrons becomes normal ( non - coherent ) and the amplitude of the persistent current decreases .",
    "moreover , resistance of the ring and thermal fluctuations start to play a role .",
    "therefore for temperatures @xmath3 , there are both coherent and dissipative parts of the total current , namely , @xmath4 the persistent current @xmath2 as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath1 depends on the parity of the number of coherent electrons .",
    "let @xmath5 denotes the probability of an even number of coherent electrons .",
    "then the formula for coherent current reads @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 the flux quantum @xmath8 is the ratio of the planck constant @xmath9 and the charge of the electron , @xmath10 is the maximal current at zero temperature . the temperature dependent amplitudes are determined by the relation @xcite @xmath11 where the characteristic temperature @xmath12 defined by the relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy gap at the fermi surface , @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 is the fermi momentum and @xmath17 is the circumference of the ring",
    ".    the dissipative current @xmath18 is determined by the ohm s law and lenz s rule @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the resistance of the ring and @xmath21 models thermal nyquist fluctuations of the ohmic current . in the first approximation ,",
    "this thermal noise is classical gaussian white noise of zero average , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23-auto - correlated function @xmath24 .",
    "the noise intensity @xmath25 is chosen in accordance with the classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "quantum corrections to classical thermal fluctuations will be considered below in the so - called smoluchowski regime . to define precisely this regime",
    ", first we have to include charging effects @xcite .",
    "to this aim , we shall construct a formal hamilton function ( i.e. energy ) of the system which consists of three parts .",
    "the first one corresponds to an effective potential related to the persistent current itself ; the second is related to the energy of the magnetic flux and the third is due to charging effects caused by capacitance @xmath26 of the system ( it corresponds to the kinetic energy of a particle ) .",
    "we define a potential energy related to the persistent current by the relation @xmath27 which reflects the well known fact that the persistent current is an equilibrium and thermodynamic phenomenon . at zero temperature",
    ", it is an energy of the set of discrete energy levels carrying persistent current .",
    "for non - zero temperature , the persistent current is averaged over the thermal distribution function and the above relation holds for a thermodynamic potential .",
    "we assume that the ring can be characterized by a capacitance @xmath26 . to justify it we cite kopietz @xcite who showed that in the diffusive regime the energy associated with long - wavelength and low - energy charge fluctuations is determined by classical charging energies and therefore the ring behaves as it were a classical capacitor .",
    "the flux dependence of these energies yields the contribution to the persistent current .",
    "the speculations that the local charge fluctuations and charging energies could contribute to persistent current has also been suggested by imry and altshuler @xcite .    from the above",
    "it follows that the total energy takes the form @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the magnetic flux induced by an external magnetic field @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a self - inductance of the system .",
    "the equation of motion , which corresponds to ( [ h ] ) , has the form @xmath32 now , we want to take into account dissipation effects .",
    "to this aim we generalize eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) replacing the coherent current @xmath2 by the total current @xmath33 given by ( [ i ] ) . as a result",
    "we obtain the evolution equation @xmath34 where the potential @xmath35 reads @xmath36\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is extended one in comparison with the equation of motion studied in ref . by including the inertial , capacitive term .",
    "its structure is similar to the model of capacitively and resistively shunted josephson junction @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of a trapped magnetic flux in a superconducting ring interrupted by the josephson junction is described by eq .",
    "( [ be ] ) by changing @xmath37 into the josephson supercurrent @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the dissipative part of the current , given by eq .",
    "( [ inor ] ) , is classical one in which a quantum character of thermal fluctuations is ignored . at lower temperatures , it can be insufficient and leading quantum corrections might be important .",
    "we do not know how to incorporate quantum corrections in a general case described by ( [ be ] ) .",
    "however , in the regimes where the charging effects can be neglected , the system can be described by the so called quantum smoluchowski equation @xcite .",
    "it has the same structure as a classical smoluchowski equation , in which the potential @xmath39 and diffusion coefficient @xmath40 are modified due to quantum effects like tunneling , quantum reflections and fluctuations . in terms of the langevin equation ( [ be ] )",
    ", it assumes the form @xmath41 this equation has to be interpreted in the ito sense @xcite .",
    "the modified potential @xmath42 and the modified diffusion coefficient @xmath43 take the form @xcite @xmath44 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument of the function .",
    "the quantum corrections are characterized by the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "it measures a deviation of the quantal flux fluctuations from its classical counterpart , namely , @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes equilibrium average , the subscripts @xmath48 and @xmath26 refer to quantal and classical cases , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath45 reads @xcite @xmath49,\\ ] ] where the psi function @xmath50 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function and @xmath51 , \\nonumber\\\\ k=(2\\omega_0 cr)^{-1 } , \\quad \\nu = 2\\pi k_bt/\\hbar.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the frequency @xmath52 is a typical frequency of the bare system and its inverse corresponds to a characteristic time of the system .",
    "now , let us determine the range of applicability of the quantum smoluchowski regime .",
    "the classical smoluchowski limit corresponds to the neglect of charging effects .",
    "formally , we should put @xmath53 in the inertial term of eq .",
    "( [ be ] ) , which is related to the strong damping limit of the brownian particle . in the case",
    "studied here it means that @xmath54 and then eq . ( [ lam2 ] ) takes the form @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the euler constant .",
    "the separation of time scales , on which the flux relaxes and the conjugate observable ( a charge ) @xcite is already equilibrated , requires the second condition , namely , @xmath57 in the deep quantum regime , i.e. when @xmath58 the correction ( [ lam3 ] ) assumes the form @xmath59.\\ ] ] in order to identify precisely the quantum smoluchowski regime , we have to determine a typical frequency @xmath52 or the corresponding characteristic time @xmath60 .",
    "there are many characteristic times in the system , which can be explicitly extracted from the evolution equation ( [ be ] ) , e.g. @xmath61 .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath62 is the relaxation time of the flux in the classical ( non - coherent ) systems and below we scale time with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "why time is scaled in this way , we refer the readers to our previous paper @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the quantum smoluchowski regime , all the above inequalities ( [ ineq1 ] ) , ( [ ineq2 ] ) and ( [ ineq3 ] ) should be fulfilled for @xmath64 .",
    "because the diffusion coefficient can not be negative , the parameter @xmath45 should be chosen small enough to satisfy the condition @xmath65 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the passage from the classical smoluchowski domain to the quantum smoluchowski domain allows for the identification of the physical regime because of the formal similarities of the inertial and capacitive terms in the equations of motion for the brownian particle and the magnetic flux , respectively .",
    "from the mathematical point of view , the langevin equation ( [ qov ] ) describes a classical markov stochastic process .",
    "therefore its all statistical properties can be obtained from the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability density . to analyze its stationary solution ,",
    "let us introduce dimensionless variables in eq .",
    "( [ qov ] ) : the rescaled flux @xmath66 and rescaled time @xmath67 , where the characteristic time @xmath68 .",

    "we compare the potential @xmath95 and the modified quantum potential @xmath70 with each other , as well as by analyzing the modified diffusion function @xmath71 ( which is constant in the classical smoluchowski domain ) . in the regime presented in fig .",

    "the state - dependent modified diffusion function @xmath71 possesses maxima and minima .",
    "the maxima and minima can be interpreted as higher and lower effective local temperatures .",
    "it means that quantum fluctuations mimic a state - dependent periodic effective temperature . for the escape dynamics the generalized thermodynamic potential @xmath96 is decisive",

    "in fact , they possess infinitely many barriers and their heights are smaller and smaller as absolute value of the flux increases . as in the previous case , the state - dependent modified diffusion function @xmath71 possesses maxima and minima which now are more distinct .",
    "values of parameters in figs .",
    "1 and 2 seem to be feasible .",
    "a part of values of parameters have been evaluated from experimental data .",
    "e.g. , following mohanty @xcite , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "the value of the parameter @xmath103 is unconfirmed .",
    "fortunately , it enters only into the quantum correction parameter @xmath100 which depends weakly ( logarithmically ) on it , cf .",
    "( [ ln ] ) .",
    "the quantum smoluchowski regime is compared to its classical counterpart .",
    "the potential @xmath95 given by ( [ v(x ) ] ) and the modified potential @xmath70 in ( [ ve(x ) ] ) are shown in the upper panel . in the inset , the modified diffusion function @xmath71 defined in ( [ d(x ) ] )",

    "it is clearly not the case in the quantum smoluchowski regime as the modified diffusion coefficient is flux - dependent .",

    "is always reflection",
    "invariant , self -sustaining fluxes are in fact _ finitely - long - living _ and appear if the peaks of the steady - state probability distribution are sufficiently high .",
    "let us consider two qualitatively different regimes .",
    "the first is the moderate temperature regime where the noiseless system is bistable .",
    "it is shown in fig.1 . for this case ,",
    "the system , if it can be described in terms of the quantum smoluchowski equation , is not able to accommodate self - sustaining flux due to the destructive role of quantum fluctuations since the steady state is effectively mono - stable .",
    "the second regime is the regime presented in fig .",
    "2 , where the onset to the multi - stable state of a noiseless system occurs .",
    "this regime is accessible either by lowering temperature or using systems with larger amplitude of persistent current , i.e. accommodating more coherent electrons . here ,",
    "the quantum corrections change significantly the properties of the system . both @xmath70 and @xmath96 become multi - stable what results in multistability of the steady state .",
    "the peaks are new since they do not appear at the classically predicted position but rather are shifted by approximately a quarter of flux quantum @xmath107 .",
    "there is a natural interpretation of such peaks : if they occur at @xmath108 they are related to self - sustaining fluxes in the system .",
    "their lifetimes can be estimated using the well established first - passage time method @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of the zero and non - zero flux stationary states depend strongly on relation between the depth of the potential well of @xmath70 and temperature . therefore they can be controlled by the system parameters .",
    "it is desirable to obtain these lifetimes much longer than the characteristic time @xmath63 , according to which time is scaled , cf .",
    "the begining of sec .",
    "iv . let us consider the regime presented in fig .",

    "such a calculated time @xmath118 .",
    "the lifetimes of the remainder states @xmath119 can be defined as @xmath110 with one absorbing and one reflecting bc .",
    "e.g. for @xmath120 , one can take @xmath121 ( which is on the left of the local maximum sticked around @xmath122 ) as an absorbing bc and @xmath123 as a reflecting bc",
    ". then @xmath124 .",
    "analogously , @xmath125 . for comparison ,",
    "the mean passage time from @xmath120 into @xmath126 is @xmath127 and from @xmath128 into @xmath120 is @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . as a result",
    ", the system in this regime can effectively be treated as _ tri - stable _ with the reasonable level of accuracy .",
    "the problem of the flux amplitude is more subtle .",
    "the modified diffusion coefficient , depicted in the insets of fig.1 . and",
    "fig.2 , is periodic with respect to the magnetic flux @xmath84 . if the magnetic flux is close to half - integer , the modified diffusion coefficient is smaller than the classical einstein one . as a result of",
    "the interplay between this phenomenon and the shape of the modified potential one observes _ statistical enhancement _ of the magnetic flux due to quantum noise .",
    "this enhancement is statistical since it allows to _ expect _ an occurrence of the flux of some amplitudes with higher _ probability _ due to quantum features of thermal equilibrium fluctuations in the quantum smoluchowski regime .",
    "this enhancement is quantitative and , contrary to different approaches @xcite , this is a purely equilibrium effect .",

    "the problem can be quantified in the following equivalent way : one can ask if the equilibrium statistics of the system is governed by ordered or quasi - ordered phases. as a measure of such a quasi - order , we exploit the celebrated shannon entropy @xcite @xmath133=-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x)\\ln p(x ) dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming a finite value of the quantum correction parameter @xmath134 results in decreasing of entropy , i.e. the system becomes more ordered @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that an effective order is due to increasing significance of the events occurring with the high probability which are either vanishing or self - sustaining fluxes .",
    "we would like to stress that the entropic criterion does not characterize stability of maxima or their life - times but rather a relative frequency of their occurrence .",
    "the shannon entropy plotted for two systems : with and without quantum smoluchowski corrections is given , as a function of temperature @xmath132 , in fig.3 . working in the classical smoluchowski regime",
    "i.e. neglecting quantum fluctuations results in lowering an overall order in the system .",
    "we would like to clarify that this effect should not be interpreted as a _ noise - induced _ order .",

    "such a system controlled by external coherent driving , i.e. equipped with an auxiliary bosonic field(s ) can be naturally studied via quantum jump approach @xcite .",
    "a steady state of the magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings is both qualitatively and quantitatively different in the classical and quantum smoluchowski regimes .",
    "quantum effects are responsible , in dependence of parameters values , for both destruction of bistability at moderate temperatures and formation of @xmath137-stability , with @xmath137 odd , at low temperatures .",
    "the nontrivial flux dependence of the steady state results in statistical enhancement of fluxes of certain amplitudes .",
    "this qualitative effect is caused by equilibrium quantum noise .",
    "validity of the multi - stability has been verified via the entropic criterion .",
    "we showed that the quantum smoluchowski regime is more ordered compared to the classical counterpart .",
    "as the mesoscopic ring is formally identical to the zero - capacitance squid , it seems that the quantum smoluchowski regime is a valid regime for wide range of the parameters of the system and hence the effects described in the paper are of importance in experiments performed on mesoscopic rings which are multistable systems .    according to the _",
    "today _ common wisdom solid state devices seem promising for implementation of quantum computers .",
    "both theoretical and experimental effort are mainly directed on superconducting qubits .",

    "such devices , due to their small diameters , can effectively become decoupled from the magnetic environment @xcite .",
    "this may equilibrate an absence of the superconducting phase with its collective properties .",
