    "symmetry is one of the basic principles that penetrate all of physics : from classical to quantum physics @xcite ; from statistical or condensed matter physics to particle physics @xcite ; and from relativity to gauge field theory .",
    "thus we see a wide range of symmetries : from external ( space - time ) to internal ones ; and from discrete to continuous ones .",
    "this is partly because geometry is an indispensable element to describing physics .",
    "and a natural algebraic language to express geometrical symmetry is group theory .",
    "@xcite    classical mechanics is widely known to have close relations between symmetries and lagrangians or hamiltonians.@xcite since quantum mechanics and field theory are , in some respects , modeled and devised after classical mechanics , we see that not a few methods and notions , including symmetry , in quantum mechanics and field theory resemble those in classical mechanics . and thus symmetry plays a crucial role also in quantum physics . or we can interpret that although `` the physical world is quantum mechanical'',@xcite the quantum feature are somewhat transmitted to the classical world ; and through the latter we may try to grasp the former .",
    "of course since we are not able to capture all nature by classical analogies , there are sometimes discrepancies between quantum symmetries and classical ones .",
    "@xcite    now , one of the typical mathematical tools that relate classical states with quantum ones is coherent states ( cs ) .",
    "@xcite it was originally devised by schrdinger @xcite as the states having classical `` particle '' nature .",
    "the state exhibits a wave packet whose center moves along with the classical trajectory with minimum uncertainty ; thus it shows classical nature .",
    "the original cs which is called canonical cs is , in the light of quantum optics , generated by displacing , or driving , the vacuum , i.e. the zero photon state .",
    "@xcite later cs have been developed in a wide variety of directions .",
    "viewed from a general framework , we may take up the following three subjects among the evolutions .",
    "first , cs have been extended to wider classes .",
    "a systematic way to broaden cs is constructing cs in terms of unitary irreducible representations of lie groups due to perelomov.@xcite in the approach , cs is defined by operating a unitary operator related to a physical system being considered on a `` fiducial vector ( fv ) '' , which we denote @xmath4 . from this point of view , for the canonical cs the unitary operator is a displacement operator and a fv is the ground state or vacuum .",
    "similarly , the spin cs can be constructed by operating a rotation operator on a fv ; the fv is conventionally taken as @xmath5 or @xmath6 : the highest or lowest eigenvectors of @xmath2 .",
    "we may perform the procedures to other lie groups , which automatically produces cs for the corresponding lie groups .",
    "schur s lemma coming from irreducibility always ensures the overcomplteness of cs .",
    "second , since cs enjoy overcomplete relations , `` coherent state path integrals ( cspi ) '' , i.e. , path integrals ( pi ) via cs , have been developed.@xcite such cspi have been pushing the method of pi forward strongly . and",
    "besides cspi turned out to be closely related to geometric phases @xcite ; in fact it is remarkable that geometric phases follow from the topological terms of phase space pi or cspi naturally .",
    "@xcite third , following the fruits of the above two developments , cs and cspi with arbitrary fv have been explored .",
    "@xcite in the case cs are obtained by operating a unitary operator on an _ arbitrary _ fv : for the canonical cs a fv is arbitrary superpositions of the fock number states ; and for the spin cs arbitrary superpositions of @xmath7 : a general eigenvector of @xmath2 .",
    "we found that , as mentioned in ref . , the canonical cs evolving from arbitrary fv@xcite turned out to be an arbitrary superposition of displaced number states having no classical analogues .",
    "similarly , we may regard spin cs evolving from a general fv other than the conventional one as quantum states without classical analogues .",
    "it is true that cs with the conventional fv are closest to classical states and have useful properties .",
    "@xcite however , recent technologies enable us to prepare quantum states which have no classical analogues ; the typical one is the squeezed states of light .",
    "@xcite we certainly regard the evolutions plausible since experimental developments due to high technologies have often created opportunities to reconsider nature . in this respect",
    "we may take cs evolving from a generic fv as the mathematical tools , or a sort of new language , for describing non - classical quantum states .",
    "and thus what we have done in refs",
    ". and is constructing new quantum states and investigating the dynamics : i.e. , the time evolutions of the quantum states .",
    "we can interpret the attempts as extending both cs due to schrdinger - klauder - glauber - perelomov and pi due to dirac - feynman - klauder - kuratsuji - suzuki .",
    "in the previous paper,@xcite hereafter referred to as * i * , we have developed a basic formulation of the su(2 ) , i.e. spin , cs based on arbitrary fv and of their pi .",
    "the cs and cspi are labeled by a full set of three euler angles @xmath8 .",
    "since the present paper flows directly out of * i * , we will look back the previous results concisely . in",
    "* i * we found out that the lagrangian in the action appeared in the pi expression were composed of two parts : the topological term related to geometric phases and the dynamical one originating from a hamiltonian . and",
    "the former is again split into two parts : one is the monopole type part which is the generalization of that of balachandran _",
    "et al._@xcite and the other represents the effect of entanglements between neighboring components of a fv .",
    "such interweaving components of a fv appear in the dynamical term as well .",
    "the monopole is fictitious in that it does not represent a real physical monopole having a magnetic charge ; instead it stems from the topological or geometric phase terms .",
    "however , mathematical descriptions seem quite common to both real and fictitious monopoles . and",
    "we have confirmed the pi form by demonstrating from discrete pi to continuous ones .",
    "moreover , it has been proved that the generic spin cspi contract to the general canonical cspi in the high spin limit .    at first sight",
    "it seems that we are free to choose fv ; there are no restrictions on fv and we may take an arbitrary fv .",
    "however , when a lagrangian varies at most a total derivative under a certain gauge transformation and possesses a sort of semiclassical symmetry , a full quantum state with an arbitrary fv does not always preserve the related symmetry . in the case , when a fv @xmath4 can not be reached from @xmath7 via @xmath9 , we find some strange feature : semiclassical orbits do not always represent exact quantal evolutions .",
    "it is stone who first observed that there does exist one of the central problems at the point viewed from a general framework of cs with arbitrary fv .",
    "he raised the problem in a paper@xcite commenting on the precursory version of * i * @xcite ; moreover , he went further enough to propose a criterion under which the cs capture full quantal evolutions . according to that ,",
    "an arbitrary fv is not always realized and that there may be restrictions on fv so that quantum evolutions are consistent with the semiclassical ones which has an original symmetry .",
    "actually , the fv have to be identical with @xmath7 or on the orbits of @xmath7 under the action of @xmath10 . and",
    ", as stone precisely pointed out , the problem is deeply related to the charge quantization of monopoles .    in this article",
    "we consider the problem posed in ref . from the general framework of spin cspi developed in * i*. as mentioned earlier , we have demonstrated the process of going from the discrete pi to the continuous pi in * i * ; we have also showed that the spin cspi contract to the canonical cspi .",
    "so the pi expressions in * i * are quite all right and are not responsible for not bringing the restriction on fv",
    ". then one might wonder from where the restriction comes .",
    "we will approach the riddle in the light of the `` gauge symmetry '' associated with the invariance of lagrangian appeared in the spin cspi in * i*. so the present article is also concerned with `` symmetry '' .",
    "it will be one of the early attempts that relate cs and cspi with symmetry , especially gauge symmetry .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we look back the spin(su(2))cspi based on arbitrary fv in @xmath11 [ sec : spincspi ] .",
    "next , using the formulation of the spin cspi , we discuss general properties of a lagrangian in the light of gauge symmetries in @xmath11 [ sec : symlagfv ] .",
    "next , in @xmath11 [ sec : lags ] we demonstrate , using simple examples , the relations between types of fv and semiclassical as well as full quantal dynamics .",
    "we then look over several real examples of lagrangians in order to see the relations between hamiltonians , fv and gauge symmetries of the whole lagrangians .",
    "main results are presented as theorems and proved in @xmath11 [ sec : gentheorems ] .",
    "theorem [ th : typefv ] gives the central result concerning the restriction on fv in the full quantum picture .",
    "we find that gauge symmetries bring restrictions on fv and thus on the form of cs .",
    "we look into the situation much deeper by investigating the generator of the symmetry transformation in theorem [ th : gform ] .",
    "next , we revisit the gauge symmetries in the light of a new kind of isotropy subgroups due to ref . in @xmath11 [ sec : anotherviewscevolvs ] ; and we see the correspondence between the approach and that in @xmath11 [ sec : symlagfv ] and @xmath11 [ sec : lags ] . finally we summarize the results in @xmath11 [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "there we also discuss the related topics that we view in a future prospect .",
    "let us recall the results in * i*. first , we define the spin(su(2))cs , @xmath12 , evolving from an arbitrary fv @xmath4 as : @xmath13 the fv @xmath4 is represented by : @xmath14 hereafter @xmath15 stands for @xmath7 . from ( [ eqn : cs1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : spinfv ] ) we obtain @xmath16 see ( * i * - 19 ) ) denotes eq .

    "@xcite let us call it the `` weak gauge symmetry '' or the `` weak gauge @xmath1-symmetry '' here so as to stress the effect of the gauge @xmath1-transformation ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) .",

    "_    so far we have concentrated on the semiclassical time evolutions .",
    "we see that a fv with certain conditions meet the symmetry of semiclassical motions .",
    "however , if we consider the full quantum dynamics conformable to the @xmath1-invariance , more stringent conditions are required of fv .",
    "moreover , we will find that the conditions on fv , i.e. those on @xmath38 , for the symmetry of hamiltonians or of the whole lagrangians are changed when we take up hamiltonians that are quadratic or higher in @xmath54 .",
    "we will look into the situations more deeply using real sample lagrangians in the next @xmath11 [ sec : lags ] .",
    "in this section we will discuss the relation between fv , hamiltonians and weak symmetry of lagrangians above mentioned by demonstrating several concrete examples . the problem is closely related to semiclassical versus full quantum time evolutions first pointed by stone .",
    "@xcite    first , we investigate a few simple examples to see how fv relate to symmetries and what semiclassical and full quantum time evolutions look like in @xmath11 [ sec : ex - simpie - llusts ] .",

    "@xmath59 are frequently employed in place of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in order that one does not confuse them with the hamiltonians @xmath60 , @xmath59 and the generator @xmath61 in the following sections we use calligraphic @xmath55 and @xmath56 to express general groups here . ]",
    "if there is no isotropy subgroups , we may regard @xmath62 .",

    "the group turns out to be @xmath78 where @xmath61 is the generator of the weak symmetry transformation ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) ; the explicit form will be given later in @xmath11 [ sec : explicit - g ] .",
    "see @xmath11 [ sec : sample - nonstandardfv1 ] for a sample fv .",
    "the case has something to do with another type of isotropy subgroups proposed by stone @xcite ; and we will investigate the case from a slightly different viewpoint in @xmath11 [ sec : anotherviewscevolvs ] . the case without even the weak symmetry is treated in @xmath11 [ sec : sample - nonstandardfv2 ] .",
    "now , we will treat concrete examples below .",
    "the examples , which are discussed by stone , @xcite are simplified versions of ref . .",
    "take a spin in a constant magnetic field @xmath79 .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath80 in what follows we will illustrate , taking three typical types of fv , the relations between hamiltonians , fv , the @xmath1-symmetry of lagrangians .",
    "we also demonstrate how semiclassical motions concern the full quantum ones for the fv .",
    "first , let a fv @xmath65 .",
    "it is rather a standard case where @xmath81 .",
    "we have @xmath82 and the @xmath40-term is absent ; and thus the topological term has the weak @xmath1-symmetry as we saw it in @xmath11 [ sec : symlagfv ] . besides since the @xmath83- and @xmath84-term vanish , @xmath85 contains no @xmath1-variables and is symmetric under ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) .",

    "[ th : typefv ]    before going into the following proof , we briefly mention in which direction we will proceed .",

    "since we assume that the gauge @xmath1-symmetry holds for a lagrangian , the lagrangian takes the form of ( [ eqn : weak - sym - lag ] ) . and",

    ". then we obtain from ( [ eqn : transf - lag ] ) and ( [ eqn : transfg - lag ] ) @xmath147 which is considered as a condition on semiclassical symmetry .    from ( [ eqn : transfg - ket ] )",
    "we have the following relation between operators : @xmath148 for an infinitesimal transformation we have @xmath149 the explicit form of @xmath61 , which we do not need in the present context , is given in @xmath11 [ sec : explicit - g ] .",

    "the dirac condition is permitted .",
    "this gives an answer to the problem posed in ref . in the light our spin cspi formalism .",
    "notice that the reverse statement does not hold : the dirac condition does not always imply @xmath65 .",
    "this is apparent since a fv @xmath164 in ( vi ) and ( vii ) in table [ tab : exlagssym ] yields @xmath165 .",
    "however , there is clearly an exceptional case : i.e. @xmath166 case in which the fv may have several nonzero components .",
    "next , we revisit ( [ eqn : weak - inv - vec3 ] ) from another viewpoint ; for a spin @xmath167 case , @xmath168 . putting @xmath169 in ( [ eqn : weak - inv - vec3 ] )",
    "we have @xmath170 , thus yielding @xmath171 .",
    "it is consistent with ( [ eqn : a_0-m ] ) . for a spin half - integer case , putting @xmath172 in ( [ eqn : weak - inv - vec3 ] ) , we have @xmath173 ; and thus we obtain @xmath174 integer ) .",

    "we have already made a similar argument about semiclassical and full quantum propagators after ( [ eqn : diff2props - fvm ] ) .",
    "note that for a spin @xmath3 case , it is always possible to write any fv in the form of @xmath176 using a suitable euler angle @xmath177 : for spin @xmath3 any fv can be reached from @xmath178 or @xmath179 .",
    "we are able to describe any two - state system in terms of su(2 ) cs .",
    "so the condition ( [ eqn : fvrm ] ) holds automatically .",
    "what we have seen here is a cs version of magnetic charge quantization which has been known for a long time .",
    "@xcite    now , it is widely known that the dirac condition is related to dirac strings . a dirac string ,",
    "extending from the origin to half infinity in the @xmath180-space , corresponds to choosing @xmath181 or @xmath182 `` section '' in the topological term ( [ eqn : toptermsym ] ) . in the present case",
    "it is surely possible to prepare the above @xmath1 since the gauge @xmath1-transformation promises the freedom . and the freedom , as we saw , comes from selecting the special type of fv : @xmath65 . hence , _ looking from the present spin cspi formalism , whether dirac strings are permissible or not depends upon the types of fv .",
    "_    one may observe that conventional arguments about the dirac condition often imply that the particle interacting with a pole has spin @xmath140 or @xmath183 , which falls within the type of fv that meets theorem [ th : typefv ] . for a generic spin @xmath184 , however , we have wider possibilities on fv .",
    "and thus we may expect so also on magnetic charge .",
    "it is , of course , an open question whether we can apply our discussion to real magnetic monopoles .",
    "however , the approach presented here may provide us with a fine view of real monopoles since real and fictitious monopoles enjoy common mathematical descriptions .      in the preceding subsection we used the operator @xmath61 satisfying ( [ eqn : transfg - ket ] ) or ( [ eqn : transf - grs3 ] ) .",
    "although we have not needed its explicit form , a natural question arises : what does it look like ?",
    "we find the explicit form of the generator @xmath61 easily in theorem [ th : gform ] below .",
    "this may be a by - product of theorem [ th : typefv ] .",
    "conversely , however , the form brings us to theorem [ th : typefv ] via another route again . hence theorem [ th : gform ]",
    "helps us to understand theorem [ th : typefv ] much deeper .    for an operator @xmath61 to satisfy ( [ eqn : transfg - ket ] ) or ( [ eqn : transf - grs3 ] )",
    "it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath61 is expressed as @xmath185 where @xmath186 .",

    "next , that ( [ eqn : g ] ) is sufficient is obvious since we only need to cross the last equality in ( [ eqn : transf - grs3-a ] ) in reverse order .",
    "we see that the generator @xmath61 is nothing but a sort of generalized `` hopf map '' .",
    "the usual hopf map is given by @xmath188 .",
    "@xcite it is often referred to as the quantity which indicates the gauge @xmath1-symmetry ; and it is also exactly what is taken as the tool of `` gauge fixing '' in refs . and .",
    "next , we revisit theorem [ th : typefv ] via theorem [ th : gform ] .",
    "now , @xmath2 is a @xmath189 matrix whose eigenvectors are completely given by @xmath190 then , operating a non - singular matrix @xmath10 on both sides of ( [ eqn : s3-ev ] ) , we have , employing ( [ eqn : g ] ) , @xmath191 which specifies all the @xmath192 eigenvectors of @xmath61 thoroughly . comparing ( [ eqn : gom ] ) with ( [ eqn : gauss ] ) , we realize that @xmath12 must coincide with one of the @xmath193 .",
    "this leads us again to ( [ eqn : oom ] ) , from which we consequently obtain ( [ eqn : fvm ] ) and ( [ eqn : a_0-m ] ) .",
    "we thus confirm that ( [ eqn : fvm ] ) and ( [ eqn : a_0-m ] ) hold again .    next , we put two additional comments .",
    "first , the form of ( [ eqn : g ] ) can be obtained also by the infinitesimal relation ( [ eqn : transf - inf - grs3 ] ) . since",
    "( [ eqn : transf - inf - grs3 ] ) is independent of @xmath184 , we may try @xmath194 matrices : @xmath195 and @xmath196 ; see ( * i*-a.1 ) for the expression of @xmath196 .",
    "in this manner we obtain ( [ eqn : g ] ) again .",
    "it is clear that the direct evaluation of @xmath197 using ( [ eqn : g-1/2 ] ) leads to ( [ eqn : transf - grs3 ] ) as well ; see refs . and",
    "for such matrix calculations .",
    "second , we point out that @xmath48 in ( [ eqn : defa ] ) , ( [ eqn : ga_0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : gom ] ) are mutually consistent .",
    "in ref . stone characterized cs , fv and the consistency between semiclassical and full quantum dynamics by a slightly different way from ours . in order to see what they looked like",
    ", he introduced the isotropy subgroup @xmath198 for a given lie group @xmath55 that stabilized the expectation values of the lie group generators in the state of a fv in addition to the usual isotropy subgroup @xmath56 in ( [ isotropysg ] ) .",
    "he showed that semiclassical orbits lived on @xmath199 , whereas the full quantum dynamics was governed by @xmath58 .",
    "let us concentrate on @xmath198 here .",
    "for the present spin cs case it reads : @xmath200 notice that @xmath201 is used in place of @xmath4 and @xmath202 instead of @xmath56 in ref . .",
    "we take latter notations to keep harmony with the expressions in the preceding sections .",
    "one may feel that the relation between the description by @xmath198 and that by @xmath56 resembles the connection between ( [ eqn : ga_0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : gauss ] ) .",
    "one describes the semiclassical dynamics ; and the other is related to full quantum time evolution .",
    "we now revisit the framework of ref . from our point of view in @xmath11",
    "[ sec : spincspi ] ",
    "@xmath11 [ sec : gentheorems ] .",
    "let us take up three representative types of fv which are numbered ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iv ) in table [ tab : exlagssym ] .",
    "then we obtain the following results due to ref .",
    "illustrated in table [ tab : isotropysg - fv ] :    @cccc@ + & ( i ) & ( ii ) & ( iv ) +   +   + fv & @xmath203 & @xmath135 & @xmath204 +   + @xmath56 & @xmath205 & @xmath74 & @xmath74 +   + @xmath198 & @xmath205 & @xmath205 & @xmath74 +   +   +    [ tab : isotropysg - fv ]    in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) we have @xmath206 .",
    "it is clear that the effect of @xmath198 in the lagrangians amounts to that of ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) which features the weak @xmath1-symmetry ; in fact we have used the convention and notation `` @xmath207 '' so that one can see the accordance easily .",
    "contrary , we have @xmath208 in the case ( iv ) ; and the case has nothing to do with the weak @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "hence we are going to investigate ( i ) and ( ii ) with the aid of ( [ eqn : isofv2sc ] ) instead of ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) .",
    "consider the topological term first .",
    "for a fv with parameter dependence we have a more appropriate interpretation of ( * i*-35 ) as : @xmath209 since ( [ eqn : pol - r2 ] ) is linear in @xmath210 , we observe that under the operation @xmath198 on @xmath4 the following relation holds : @xmath211 where we have used ( [ eqn : isofv2sc ] ) .",
    "hence , the topological term @xmath212 is weakly symmetric under @xmath198 .",
    "the result may be obvious ; for it is clear that ( [ eqn : isofv2sc ] ) corresponds to ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) . besides , assuming @xmath213 in ( i ) , @xmath31 is also linear in @xmath210 in the present cases ( i ) and ( ii ) in tables [ tab : exlagssym ] and [ tab : isotropysg - fv ] ; and thus @xmath214 is invariant under @xmath198 . then the whole lagrangians possesses the weak @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "so we have confirmed that the condition ( [ eqn : isofv2sc ] ) reproduces one about weak @xmath1-gauge symmetry for a lagrangian discussed in @xmath11 [ sec : symlagfv ] .    if one tries to express the complete symmetry of hamiltonians that have such higher order products of @xmath210 as @xmath215 in ( [ eqn : h - nqr ] ) , more stringent conditions like @xmath216 may be required . here",
    "@xmath217 is an arbitrary @xmath218 product of @xmath54 or @xmath2 that appears in the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , we know @xmath215 gives @xmath219 ; and ( [ eqn : isofv2sc2 ] ) contains the condition @xmath220 .",
    "augmented with ( [ eqn : isofv2sc2 ] ) we see that the description due to @xmath198 brings a criteria for the weak gauge symmetry which works on all the cases in table [ tab : exlagssym ] .    we have thus looked over two types of descriptions on cs , fv and semiclassical evolutions : one uses the shift of the @xmath1 variable in @xmath10 as ( [ eqn : transfrs3 ] ) and the other , i.e. , ( [ eqn : isofv2sc ] ) and ( [ eqn : isofv2sc2 ] ) , employs a transformed fv .",
    "they equally describe semiclassical dynamics well . and no matter what description we choose , both ref . and theorem [ th : typefv ] in @xmath11 [ sec : gentheorems ]",
    "tell us that if we have the gauge @xmath1-symmetry , we are led to a standard fv and informative cs in the full quantum dynamics .",
    "we have studied lagrangians having a weak gauge symmetry in the light of spin cspi with a general fv .",
    "we have set a condition on a state vector in order that the full quantum description keeps the semiclassical symmetry .",
    "this gives the restriction on fv .",
    "the types of cs get limited ; it is mandatory that the spin cs ride on the orbits of @xmath15 under the action of @xmath10 in the full quantum dynamics .",
    "and the fictitious monopole charge @xmath48 is so quantized as to bring the dirac condition .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath1-variable becomes `` anomalous '' .",
    "of course in natural sciences it is nature who gives a final decision .",
    "however , we expect that the results are all right in the case . concerning the matter , we find that the results agree with those due to stone,@xcite who first posed the problem in a general framework of cs and fv .",
    "notice that _ the rule to determine @xmath48 , i.e. the monopole charge or strength , is not built in the cspi a priori , but we impose it from physical demands  gauge @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "_ this is the way in which spin cspi with general fv bring the dirac condition for fictitious monopole charges .",
    "remember that the monopole charge quantization condition is not derived by the schrdinger equation itself , but by boundary or topological conditions also in the usual wave function formalisms .",
    "@xcite    now , let us see a future prospect . first , in the present paper , we have treated lagrangians with the @xmath1-gauge symmetry . if we consider a lagrangian without the symmetry , the situation looks rather different .",
    "see , for example , ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) in table [ tab : exlagssym ] . in the cases , we could not impose a subsidiary condition , i.e. gauss law , which produces the quantization of a fictitious monopole charge @xmath48 anymore .",
    "theorem [ th : typefv ] does not bring us any information for the case .",
    "and then what would happen to a fv , @xmath4 , and @xmath48 ?",
    "the problem , as well as physical applications of the present case , seems to be so intriguing for future investigations .",
    "second , it is clear that the present formalism may be extended to wider cspi cases ; among them su(1 , 1 ) and su(3 ) cases sound most probable candidates .",
    "the latter case is , of course , related to qcd .",
    "what do the restrictions on fv give physical systems described in terms of these cs ?",
    "do they bring new information other than the previous ones ?",
    "@xcite in this respect it might be as well to remember that stone @xcite actually discussed the restriction on fv for cs constructed from wider lie groups .",
    "third , we give subsidiary comments on cs and fv : one might observe a close formal analogy between cs with general fv and the ground states of many body systems or vacua in field theory .",
    "@xcite at least mathematical apparatus , a lie group @xmath55 and its coset space @xmath58 , are common to both of the cases .",
    "@xcite fv look like ground states or vacua .",
    "of course , in the many body systems the ground states themselves are expressed in terms of cs .",
    "however , such ground states are also absorbed into arbitrary fv .",
    "moreover , we may be able to prepare room for dealing symmetries associated with higher energy levels than vacua with the aid of the present arbitrary fv formalism .",
    "it is an open question as to whether there are some deeper implications behind the formal resemblance .",
    "in addition we want to indicate one more point on cs and fv .",
    "it is on the definitions of two types of isotropy subgroups @xmath198 and @xmath56 in @xmath11 [ sec : anotherviewscevolvs ] .",
    "they correspond to the relation between ( [ eqn : ga_0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : gauss ] ) .",
    "it seems natural to feel that they remind us of subsidiary conditions in covariant quantization of photons due to gupta - bleuler.@xcite in that case the expectation value of the operator describing the lorentz condition for a state vector is more crucial than the effect of the operation on the vector itself to establish the connection between quantized photon field and classical electrodynamics . and a certain gauge transformation leaves the expectation value invariant .",
    "this is also the case for the above - mentioned vacua in field theory ; there again the expectation value of a field operator plays a central role .",

    "<S> from the viewpoint of the formulation of the su(2 ) coherent states and their path integrals labeled by a full set of euler angles @xmath0 which we developed in the previous paper , we study the relations between gauge symmetries of lagrangians and allowed quantum states ; we investigate permissible types of fiducial vectors in the full quantum dynamics in terms of su(2 ) coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a general framework for a lagrangian having a certain gauge symmetry with respect to one of the euler angles @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when a lagrangian has the gauge symmetry fiducial vectors are so restricted that they belong to the eigenstates of @xmath2 or to the orbits of them under the action of the su(2 ) ; and the strength of a fictitious monopole , which appears in the lagrangian , is a multiple of @xmath3 . in this case dirac strings are permitted . </S>",
    "<S> one exceptional case exists when the fictitious monopole charge disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning here does not work for a lagrangian without the gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between formulations and results of the preceding work by stone that has piloted us and those by ours are also discussed . </S>"
