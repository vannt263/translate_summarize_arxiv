    "see @xcite .",
    "at the same time , lambda cold dark matter @xmath0cdm models have been developed , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several simulations have been created , such as the millennium simulation @xcite done by @xcite and another _",
    "n_-body simulation by @xcite .",
    "these models describe a universe that consists mainly of dark energy and dark matter and calculate the evolution of the universe from a short time after the big bang to the present time .",
    "work has been done to verify the similarity between the real universe and simulated universe @xcite and they agree well , based on the comparative techniques used in these studies .    to supplement the widely used correlation function and power spectrum ,",
    "alternatives have been proposed to quantify structure in the galaxy distribution , such as the genus curve @xcite , percolation statistics @xcite , rhombic cell analysis @xcite , void probability functions @xcite , high - order correlation function @xcite , and multi - fractal measures @xcite .",
    "however , all of these consider a single map as a space . here",
    "we generalize the metric space technique ( mst ) , a tool used to analyze and classify astrophysical maps @xcite , to perform a multi - scale analysis .",
    "key facets of the mst approach are consideration of any given map as an element in the space of all such maps and definitions of a distance function to make the spaces of all maps into a topological space .",
    "moreover , the other methods focus on summary statistics that convey little of the geometric and topological properties of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the mst method gives desired quantitative summary statistics of the difference between maps .",
    "however , a primary benefit of our method is that the output functions , such as filamentation , number of components , density , volume and pixels , are straightforward and simple to understand and particularly useful in maps comparisons .",
    "finally , mst is based on the use of threshold values , which will make sure that we can unambiguously define a space on the map with an interesting topology @xcite .",
    "the mst allows an objective and quantitative comparison of any two images .",
    "all such images are considered to be elements of a metric space , where , instead of comparing images on a pixel - to - pixel basis , the comparison is made by considering the metric distance between two images output functions .",
    "the mst was first used to analyze galactic molecular cloud data @xcite .",
    "several mathematical and technical improvements to the technique were presented in @xcite ( for more details , see @xcite , where the updated formalism was used to analyze galactic atomic hydrogen gas regions from the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite . for both studies",
    "the output functions were applied to two - dimensional gray - scale images which described a smooth density field .",
    "but as originally suggested by @xcite , one can choose to smooth point distribution data ( e.g. , galaxy distribution ) in order to obtain gray - scale data from which the output functions can be calculated . the first application to point distribution",
    "is done by @xcite .",
    "importantly , however , the smoothing level becomes critical in creating the density field @xcite .",
    "efforts have concentrated on determining the best density estimate from optimal smoothing length @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a wide range of smoothing levels for multi - scale filtering @xcite . by varying the size of the smoothing function over a range of scales , exactly like the wavelet transform",
    ", a complete multi - scale description of galaxy distributions in metric space becomes possible .",
    "the goal of this paper is therefore to use the multi - scale mst to quantify morphological differences between the sdss observational data and two sets of simulation sample data and then illustrate the use of those differences to understand degrees and types of structure in the galaxy distribution . here",
    "the point ( galaxy ) distribution data was filtered by a smoothing function over a continuous range of scales .",
    "using this novel approach , the mst not only informs us , quantitatively , about the structure information of the universe and which mock sample most resembles the observational data , but also how the information and resemblance vary over size scales .",
    "the formalism has been developed as a form description tool with the aim of comparing any two different astrophysical maps . in previous studies , any given image would always be compared to a uniform image where all pixels have the same value @xcite . in this way ,",
    "two images were separately compared to a uniform image , giving information on `` how far '' ( in the metric sense ) both fall from uniformity , thus quantifying the complexity of each of the maps .",
    "this approach will be used here , but additionally however , the observational data from the sdss will also be directly compared to the mock sample data , giving information on how far each mock sample is from the observations .      instead of comparing the smoothed maps on a pixel - to - pixel basis , information is extracted from the maps in the form of _ output functions_. an output function is a one - dimensional function representing a profile of some meaningful physical quantity .",
    "its independent variable is the pixel value ( intensity ) , called the _ threshold value _ @xmath1 , and @xmath2 denotes a smoothed galaxy distribution image .",
    "the density output function characterizes the fraction @xmath3 of material at densities higher than the reference threshold value @xmath1 : @xmath4 d^2x \\over { \\int \\sigma(x ) d^2x } }    \\label{density}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a step function and the integrals are taken over a bounded domain , from the minimal threshold values .",
    "this function measures the amount of material occurring at a given density , reflecting how much material occupies a fixed projected volume .",
    "the distribution of density can be useful to characterize the condensation of material .",
    "this is useful in cosmology because theoretical considerations suggest that galaxies form in the highest density regions .",
    "the distribution of volume characterizes the amount of space occupied by material at a fixed density level .",
    "the distribution of projected volume characterizes the volume fraction @xmath6 of material at densities higher than the reference threshold value @xmath1 : @xmath7 d^2x \\over { \\int d^2x } } \\label{volume}\\ ] ] this is an important parameter when considering how galaxies are distributed , since the volume output function will quantify the space filled by galaxies .",
    "the number of pixels representing various numbers of data points is counted in a histogram : @xmath8 }    \\label{pixels}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a step function and @xmath9 is the number of elements of the set .",
    "this function is also of interest to be applied to the galaxy distribution , since different spatially distributed populations can create different histogram shapes .",
    "a topological component is a set of connected pixels in a smoothed map for a fixed threshold value .",
    "we use the notation @xmath10 to denote the distribution of components ( the number of components as a function of the threshold value ) .",
    "the distribution of components can measure the connections of material , making it useful to indicate the interaction among galaxies .",
    "each component can be associated with a filament index , @xmath11 , which characterizes the filamentary structure of the component .",
    "@xmath11 is defined in the following way : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the longest straight line between any two parts in the component and the area of the component , respectively . from this definition",
    "one can see that a thin or elongated component will have a higher filament index than a more circular component , for which @xmath11 will be close to 1 .",
    "it is interesting in cosmology because a thin component is generally the boundary of a void or a string of galaxies , and the more circular component is generally a cluster .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of the filament indices as a function of threshold value @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "as originally mentioned in @xcite this definition of the filament index has a fault in that it can not characterize adequately the filamentary structure of non - convex objects . a new definition of the filament index is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the perimeter of the component .",
    "the details of the justification for introducing this new definition are given in the appendix .",
    "for any functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the euclidean metric @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where , for this study , @xmath23 .",
    "if we want to compare a specific output function in two of our maps , we use the following equation : @xmath24 here @xmath1 is the threshold value , @xmath25 is a specific output function and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are maps .",
    "since @xmath1 is discrete in our analysis , we approximate equation ( [ euclidian1 ] ) with a summation .    in order to obtain the distance between the output functions of the images under study , in this paper",
    "we apply this method in two ways .",
    "one way is that the observed images are compared to uniform images , giving us information on `` how far '' ( in the metric sense ) the observation fall from uniformity , thus giving quantitative information on the complexity of observed images .",
    "another way is that all mock images are compared to observed images , thus , each coordinate gives quantitative information as to `` how far '' the mock image is from observed data sets .",
    "clearly , the larger each coordinate is , the `` farther '' the mock image under study is from the observational data .",
    "coordinates are calculated for each of the output functions , for each of the mock sample data sets , and for each size scale considered .",
    "following the ranking procedure introduced in @xcite , once the coordinates for all output functions are calculated , each coordinate is divided by the maximal coordinate ( out of all mock sample coordinates for a particular output function ) .",
    "these normalized coordinates are then added to each other for each output function to yield an overall distance value . for each size scale , this distance value quantifies the difference between each mock sample and the observational data .      the two - dimensional gaussian smoothing function is defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 . in full analogy with the continuous wavelet transform @xcite , gaussian",
    "filtering can be described by @xmath30(\\textbf{b},a)=\\frac{1}{a^{2}}\\int f(\\textbf{x})\\cdot g(\\frac{\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{b}}{a})d^{2}\\textbf{x }   \\label{gauss_filter}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a two - dimensional function representing the image under study , @xmath31 is the gaussian function ( equation ( [ gauss ] ) ) , which can also be defined as a wavelet .",
    "@xmath32 is the scale parameter , and @xmath33 is a position vector .",
    "thus , the convolution between the point distribution images under study and the gaussian filter at several different values of the scale parameter @xmath32 yields the continuous gray - scale images from which the output functions and then the coordinates can be calculated .",
    "the observational galaxy sample was taken from the sdss dr 5 @xcite .",
    "dr 5 includes five - band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg@xmath34 , and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies , quasars , and stars selected from 5713 deg@xmath34 of that imaging data .",
    "this sample of galaxies is approximately complete down to an apparent @xmath35-band petrosian magnitude limit of 17.77 , with absolute magnitudes _ k_-corrected @xcite .",
    "in order to limit the effects of incompleteness on our group identification , we restrict our sample to regions of the sky where the completeness ( the ratio of obtained redshifts to spectroscopic targets ) is greater than 90% , and @xmath35-band magnitude limit is 17.5 ( this will improve the uniformity of coverage across the sky ) .",
    "redshift range is from 0.015 to 0.1 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath0 and @xmath38 are the telescope coordinates ) .",
    "our sample covers 2904 deg@xmath34 on the sky . to ensure completeness ,",
    "a volume - limited sample region was delineated .",
    "the final galaxy sample is approximately complete down to an absolute @xmath35-band magnitude limit -19.9 and contains 35,726 galaxies .",
    "we split the whole sample into 12 slices ( see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) , which strictly follow the survey coordinates ( @xmath39 ) , each slice corresponding to a roughly east - west stripe on the sky .",
    "[ geometry ] describes the observed sample geometry .",
    "2.5 degrees each ) in @xmath38 . ]",
    "there are two major reasons for choosing 12 slices : ( 1 ) each slice is approximately two - dimensional and ( 2 ) the slice - to - slice variations determine error bars , while keeping the number of objects per slice at a fairly high level .",
    "each slice includes around 2977 galaxies and those galaxy positions are projected onto a two - dimensional image ( projection perpendicular to the slice ) .",
    "mock samples from two model universe simulations were used to compare with the observational samples .",
    "one model universe is from the nyu mock galaxy catalog @xcite in redshift ( velocity ) space , henceforth referred as nyur .",
    "they used the hashed - oct - tree ( hot ) code ( warren & salmon 1993 ) to make _",
    "n_-body simulations of the @xmath0cdm cosmological model , with @xmath40 = 0.7 , @xmath41 = 1.0 , and @xmath42 .",
    "they identify halos in the dark matter particle distributions using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length equal to 0.2 times the mean inter particle separation .",
    "they then populate these halos with galaxies using a simple model for the hot of galaxies more luminous than a luminosity threshold .",
    "every halo with a mass @xmath43 greater than a minimum mass @xmath44 gets a central galaxy that is placed at the halo center of mass and is given the mean halo velocity . a number of satellite galaxies is then drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath45 , for @xmath46 .",
    "these satellite galaxies are assigned the positions and velocities of randomly selected dark matter particles within the halo .",
    "this model is in good agreement with a wide variety of cosmological observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another mock sample is from the millennium run semianalytic galaxy catalogue @xcite produced at the max - planck institute for astrophysics ( mpa ) , henceforth referred to as mpar .",
    "the simulation itself was carried out with a special version of the gadget-2 code @xcite .",
    "they use @xmath47 , and @xmath42 .",
    "they apply in post - processing an improved and extended version of the subfind algorithm of @xcite to identify halos and a semianalytic model model to build galaxies .",

    "[ slice ] shows examples of slices from each sample used in this paper .",
    "fig . [ output_functions ] shows the calculated output functions ( section [ sect_output ] ) for the observational sdss data , as well as for all mock sample data , where only the functions corresponding to the size scale 15 mpc ( smoothed to that scale ) are shown .",

    "simply speaking , for each output function at each scale group we find the maximal value first ( among observed , nyur , mpar and random samples ) , and then other values will be normalized by this maximal value ( the maximal value itself will be changed to `` 1 '' after normalization ) . in this way",
    "we normalize the different output functions to sum them together .",

    "we have used a slightly modified mst of @xcite on multiple scale to study the morphology of galaxy distributions .",
    "the technique gives a detailed morphological description of galaxy distributions in metric space , on scales from about 5 mpc to about 250 mpc , with five output functions showing strong statistical differences .",
    "we also find that the filament output function values are high for the observations at small filtering scales but at around 50 mpc the function approaches a lower stable value .",
    "considering that most voids in sdss galaxies are around 3050 mpc @xcite , this seems a likely signature of those voids .",
    "the key motivation for this work is to supplement traditional tools with a more informative way of quantifying the similarity in the `` visual '' morphological properties between simulations and the observed universe .",
    "we use the `` metric distance '' as the parameter to describe that similarity through multiple measures by calculating the value of each of the mst output functions .",
    "we combine the values of each of the output functions into one `` final '' parameter for each simulation by the maximal ranking method . in table 1 and",
    "[ distance_scale ] , it was demonstrated that two _",
    "n_-body simulations have done a similar job of approximating our universe and that nyur is more close to the observed sample than mpar . from the analysis for fig .",
    "[ physical_space ] , we surprisingly found that mpap is more closely matched than the nyup to the observed sample in redshift space , with the implication that velocity determinations for simulation galaxies is a major contributor to the relatively poorer match of the mpa simulation .",
    "the velocities of satellite galaxies in nyu simulation halos are assigned randomly from the dark matter particles within the haloes @xcite . however , in the mpa simulation , even satellite galaxies have interpolated velocities ( taken from the subhalo ) rather than just randomly assigned ones @xcite .",
    "it is very likely that the mechanism for producing the velocity of satellite galaxies in mpa simulation contributes noticeably to the relative shortcomings of mpar in fig .",
    "[ distance_scale ] .",
    "while the mst yields a single statistic for comparison of structure maps , in a way similar to other measures of large scale structure , we submit that its greater utility is in providing multiple intermediate outputs that convey insight into the physical differences between samples that lead to the statistical result . of the many topological characteristics , threshold values , and scale samplings that the mst aggregates into a final result , we highlight a few examples of the specific physical differences that the technique reveals .    first , we have the expected result that the random sample is much different from all other samples at virtually all scales for all output functions .",
    "we have chosen only to use that case for normalization in the maximal ranking step .",
    "now , for our much more meaningful comparisons among mpa , nyu , and observed samples , we see that for the density output function , mpa has more high - density pixels ( at about the 5@xmath2 level ) than nyu sample , and the nyu sample has more high - density pixels than observed sample ( 1 - 2 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the volume and pixels output functions show similar trends as the density output function with the implication that those high - density pixels are also accompanied by large area regions of pixels above the various thresholds .",
    "the components and filament output functions are more complicated and fluctuate with the increasing scale .",
    "simply speaking , for scales less than 50 mpc , nyu and the observed sample are close to each other ( around 1 @xmath2 ) , but mpa clearly has many more sizeable clumps ( greater than 3@xmath2 ) and is also more filamentary ( greater than 3@xmath2 ) . for scales more than 50 mpc , mpa shows more filamentary structure ( greater than 3@xmath2 ) than nyu sample , which is a little more filamentary ( 0.5 - 2 @xmath2 ) than the observed sample . and observed sample has more clumps ( 1@xmath2 ) than both mock samples .",
    "our next step is to apply the mst to the full three - dimensional galaxy distribution , which will require redevelopment / extension of output functions .",
    "the millennium run simulation used in this paper was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing center of the max - planck society in garching .",
    "the semianalytic galaxy catalog is publicly available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/agnpaper .",
    "we thank andreas a. berlind for providing the nyu mock galaxy catalog .",
    "let us first recall the definition of the filament index : @xmath49 note first that @xmath11 depends only upon two values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are respectively the diameter and the area of the component .",
    "since we use the standard definition of a diameter ( i.e. , for a component @xmath50 , the diameter of @xmath50 is @xmath51 ) , there is a possibility that two components having quite different structures end up having the same filament index value ( fig .",

    ".1 in .1 in .1 in .1 in      the diameter , and therefore the filament index of non - convex components is under - estimated .",
    "contrary to what was originally said in @xcite , the cause of this problem _ is not _",
    "the fact that the definition of the diameter is not well adapted for non - convex components",
    ". a closer look at the definition of the filament index shows that one of its attributes is the circumference of a circle , @xmath53 : @xmath54 so by definition , the filament index `` expects '' to be treating convex objects ( a circle certainly being the most trivial example of a convex object ) . and",
    "that is where the change should be made : instead of changing the definition of the diameter , one should simply change the definition of the perimeter to have it in its most general form , @xmath18 .",
    "so the generalized version of the filament index is therefore @xmath55 where @xmath18 is the perimeter of the underlying object .",

    "all have the same area . @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath52 have the same diameter , but since the perimeter of @xmath52 is larger , their ( newly generalized ) filament index is different . since object",
    "@xmath56 has a larger diameter and a larger perimeter than object @xmath14 , it therefore has a larger filament index . and",
    "although objects @xmath52 and @xmath56 have the same perimeter , since object @xmath56 has a larger diameter , it has a larger filament index . ]",
    "one can readily see from fig .",
    "[ fault ] that although both objects have the same diameter and area , since their perimeter is quite different , object b will have the larger filament index , which is what one would intuitively expect . in fig .",
    "[ 3blobs ] are shown three objects of increasing filament index value .",
    "one can easily see how the newly generalized filament index definition will greatly help in the distinction of different geometrical features in the analyzed objects ( or components ) .",
    "however , this new definition of @xmath11 is still degenerate in the sense that one can still find an infinite number of objects having the same @xmath11 .",
    "however , the degree of degeneracy is much less than for the standard , original definition of @xmath11 ."
