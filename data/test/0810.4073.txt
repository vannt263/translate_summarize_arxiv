    "one body transition density operators play an important role in the microscopic description of various properties showing up in nuclear systems .",
    "for example , the charge density operator matrix elements corresponding to the ground state of a spherical system can be determined , with high precision , in elastic electron scattering , which results in having precious information about the spatial charge distribution .",
    "similarly , the matrix elements between the ground state and excited states within the ground band might provide information about the nuclear shape @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a electron scattering experiment at large momentum transfer the radial dependence of the charge distribution can be directly measured . combining this result with other information on electromagnetic interaction in the considered nuclei , in the reference quoted above more refined statements on the deformed shapes could be made .",
    "the structure of the spectra in deformed nuclei requires the use of a deformed mean field .",
    "the final state describing an interacting many body system is a deformed state and , therefore , its use for the description of the transition probabilities requires the projection of the components with good angular momentum . in particular , in order to account for the contribution of the tensorial components of the charge density , the many body ground state built up with deformed single particle states must be projected over the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that projection is of paramount importance for transitional and deformed nuclei .",
    "however , the correction brought by projection to the results obtained in the intrinsic frame depends on the observable under consideration @xcite .",
    "for example , averaging a model hamiltonian on an intrinsic ground state yields the system energy , while averaging it on angular momentum projected states , a whole band of energy levels is obtained .",
    "for instance , for the collective magnetic dipole state with a deformed single particle basis one obtains @xmath3 states which are abusively called @xmath4 states . to our knowledge",
    "there is no rigorous proof that the admixture with the components of angular momentum 2 is negligible .",
    "another example we want to comment upon , is that of the rotational bands which are considered to be a set of states characterized by the same quantum number @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the laboratory frame of reference , @xmath5 is not a good quantum number and the meaning of a @xmath5-state is actually a state with a dominant @xmath5-component .",
    "the effect of projection is felt by the operator matrix elements .",
    "there are cases of operators whose matrix elements are affected very little by the the angular momentum projection of the intrinsic states . the simplest case is the one when the operator is just a c - number constant .",
    "its matrix elements in the unprojected and projected states are equal to each other . at first glance , that would suggest that other operators insensitive to projecting the angular momentum from the intrinsic wave function , would be scalar operators . of course , that is not true and an example is the boson number operator in a phenomenological picture",
    ".    one issue of the present paper is to study the scalar part of the charge density operator within the generalized coherent state model ( gcsm ) .",
    "thus , we shall consider the matrix element of the charge density operator , truncated at its scalar term , on the unprojected ground state and , alternatively , on the projected @xmath6 state .",
    "we address also the question of how different are these matrix elements from those corresponding to a high angular momentum projected state .",
    "all matrix elements quoted above are studied as function of nuclear deformation .",
    "another scalar operator which is studied here is the e0 transition operator .",
    "the monopole transition is often used to characterize various states of angular momentum equal to zero .",
    "thus , in ref.@xcite two of us ( p.s . and e.m .",
    ") expressed the monopole for the transition @xmath7 strength in terms of the mixing coefficient of the two states characterized by different deformations but lying close to each other in energy . in this way",
    "the transition strength may provide the mixing coefficient for the two states . in @xmath8gd",
    "several @xmath9 states have been seen in a ( p , t ) experiment @xcite .",
    "these states have been microscopically interpreted within a projected shell model and , alternatively , within the quasiparticle - phonon model @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite calculated the e2 strength for the transition from the ground state to the first @xmath10 state , the e0 strength for the transition from the excited @xmath9 states to the ground state , and the two - nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes .",
    "the experimental strengths for e0 and e2 transitions are concentrated in one and two states respectively , while the theoretical results @xcite show a large fragmentation of the two transition strengths .",
    "the experimental spectroscopic amplitudes indicate that two states are mainly populated , which contrasts the theoretical result where the amplitude is fragmented among several states . from the analysis of ref.@xcite it seems that the e0 strength is a signature only for one excited @xmath9 state , as in fact",
    "was considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "the project mentioned above will be described according to the following plan . in section",
    "ii a brief description of the generalized coherent state model will be given .",
    "that will help us to introduce the useful notations and to approach a self - contained presentation .",
    "the charge density expansion in terms of the quadrupole collective coordinates is given in section iii .",
    "the monopole transition amplitude is treated in section iv .",
    "the numerical applications are given in section v , while the final conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "the description of magnetic properties in nuclei has always been a central issue .",
    "the reason is that the two systems of protons and neutrons respond differently when they interact with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "differences are due to the fact that by contrast to neutrons , protons are charged particles , the proton and neutron magnetic moments are different from each other and , finally , the proton and neutron numbers in a given nucleus are , in general , different .",
    "many papers have been devoted to explaining various features of the collective dipole mode called , conventionally , scissors mode .",
    "the name of the mode was suggested by lo iudice and palumbo who interpreted the dipole mode , within the two rotor model @xcite , as a scissors like oscillation of proton and neutron systems described by two axially symmetric ellipsoids , respectively .    the coherent state model ( csm ) , proposed by raduta _",
    "_ to describe the lowest three collective interacting bands @xcite , was extended by including the isospin degrees of freedom in order to account for the collective properties of the scissors mode @xcite .",
    "this extension is conventionally called `` the generalized coherent state model''(gcsm ) .",
    "csm starts with the construction of a restricted collective space , by projecting out the components of good angular momentum from three orthogonal quadrupole boson states .",
    "these states are chosen such that they are orthogonal before and after projection .",
    "one of the three deformed states , the intrinsic ground state , is a coherent state of glauber type with respect to the zero component of the quadrupole boson , @xmath11 , while the other two are obtained by acting with elementary boson polynomials on the ground state . in choosing the intrinsic excited states we take care that the projected states considered in the vibrational limit have to provide the multi - phonon vibrational spectrum , while for the large deformation regime their behavior coincides with that predicted by the liquid drop model .",
    "in contrast to the csm , which uses only one boson for the composite system of protons and neutrons , within the gcsm the protons are described by quadrupole proton - like bosons , @xmath12 , while the neutrons by quadrupole neutron - like bosons , @xmath13 . since one deals with two quadrupole bosons instead of one , one expects to have a more flexible model and to find a simpler solution satisfying the restrictions required by csm .",
    "the restricted collective space is defined by the states describing the three major bands , ground , beta and gamma , as well as the band based on the isovector state @xmath4 .",
    "orthogonality conditions are satisfied by the following 6 functions which generate by angular momentum projection , 6 rotational bands : @xmath14    \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi^{(\\beta)}_{jm}&=&n^{(\\beta)}_jp^j_{m0}\\omega_{\\beta}\\psi_g , \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi^{(\\gamma)}_{jm}&=&n^{(\\gamma)}_jp^j_{m2}(b^{\\dag}_{n2}-b^{\\dag}_{p2})\\psi_g , \\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{\\phi}^{(\\gamma)}_{jm}&=&\\tilde{n}^{(\\gamma)}_jp^j_{m2}(\\omega^{\\dag}_{\\gamma , p,2}+\\omega^{\\dag}_{\\gamma , n,2})\\psi_g , \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi^{(1)}_{jm}&=&n^{(1)}_jp^j_{m1}(b^{\\dag}_nb^{\\dag}_p)_{11}\\psi_g , \\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{\\phi}^{(1)}_{jm}&=&\\tilde{n}^{(1)}_jp^j_{m1}(b^{\\dag}_{n1}-b^{\\dag}_{p1})\\omega^{\\dag}_{\\beta}\\psi_g .",
    "\\label{figcsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the following notations have been used : @xmath15 note that apriory we can not select one of the two sets of states @xmath16 and @xmath17 for gamma band , although one is symmetric and the other asymmetric against proton neutron permutation .",
    "the same is true for the two isovector candidates for the dipole states . in ref.@xcite",
    ", results obtained by using alternatively a symmetric and an asymmetric structure for the gamma band states were presented .",
    "therein it was shown that the asymmetric structure for the gamma band does not conflict any of the available data . by contrary ,",
    "considering for the gamma states an asymmetric structure and fitting the model hamiltonian coefficients in the manner described in ref.@xcite , a better description for the beta band energies is obtained . moreover , in that situation the description of the e2 transition becomes technically very simple .",
    "for these reasons , here we make the option for a proton neutron asymmetric gamma band .",
    "all calculations performed so far considered equal deformations for protons and neutrons .",
    "the deformation parameter for the composite system is : @xmath18 the factors @xmath19 involved in the expressions of wave functions are normalization constants calculated in terms of some overlap integrals .",
    "we seek now an effective hamiltonian for which the projected states ( [ figcsm ] ) are , at least in a good approximation , eigenstates in the restricted collective space .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian fulfilling this condition is : @xmath20 the hamiltonian given by eq.([hgcsm ] ) has only one off - diagonal matrix element in the basis ( [ figcsm ] ) . that is @xmath21 .",
    "however , our calculations show that this affects the energies of @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands by an amount of a few kev . therefore ,",
    "the excitation energies of the six bands are in a very good approximation given by the diagonal element : @xmath24 it can be easily checked that the model hamiltonian does not commute with the components of the @xmath25 spin operator : @xmath26    hence , the eigenstates of @xmath27 are @xmath28 mixed states . however , the expectation values of the @xmath28 operator on the projected model states are equal to zero .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the proton and neutron deformations are considered to be equal . in this case",
    "the states are of definite parity , with respect to the proton - neutron permutation , which is consistent with the structure of the model hamiltonian which is invariant with respect to such a symmetry transformation . to conclude , by contrast to the iba2 hamiltonian",
    ", the gcsm hamiltonian is not @xmath25 spin invariant .",
    "another difference to the iba2 , the most essential one , is that the gcsm hamiltonian does not commute with the boson number operators . due to this feature",
    "the coherent state approach proves to be the most adequate one to treat the hamiltonian in eq.(2.4 ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic state @xmath4 , derived in ref.@xcite , shows clearly that the phenomenological description of two liquid drops and two rigid rotors are just particular cases of gcsm , defined by specific restrictions .",
    "the gcsm seems to be the only phenomenological model which treats simultaneously the m1 and e2 properties . indeed , in refs.@xcite the ground , beta and gamma bands are considered together with a @xmath29 band built on the top of the scissor mode @xmath4 .",
    "by contrast to the other phenomenological and microscopic models , which treat the scissors mode in the intrinsic reference frame , here one deals with states of good angular momentum and , therefore , there is no need to restore the rotational symmetry . as shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", the gcsm provides for the total m1 strength an expression which is proportional to the nuclear deformation squared .",
    "consequently , the m1 strength of @xmath4 and the b(e2 ) value for @xmath10 are proportional to each other , although the first quantity is determined by the convection current while the second one by the static charge distribution .",
    "one weak point of most phenomenological models is that they use expressions for transition operators not consistent with the structure of the model hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the transition probabilities are influenced by the chosen hamiltonian only through the wave functions . by contradistinction , in refs .",
    "@xcite the e2 transition operator , as well as the m1 form - factor are derived analytically by using the equation of motion of the collective coordinates determined by the model hamiltonian . in this way",
    "a consistent description of electric and magnetic properties of many nuclei was attained .    here",
    "we complete the gcsm achievements by considering scalar operators such as those involved in the ground state charge density and the monopole transitions , @xmath2 .",
    "as we have already mentioned we address issues like , how sensitive are these quantities to the projection operation and also what is the influence of the nuclear deformation @xmath30}$ ] .",

    "expanding the charge density around the surface corresponding to vanishing quadrupole coordinates one obtains : @xmath37.\\ ] ] in momentum space the charge density can be written as a sum of tensor operators of various ranks .",
    "for example the term of rank @xmath38 and projection @xmath39 reads : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the spherical bessel function of first kind .",
    "the transfer momentum , during the scattering process with a charged particle , is denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is a normalization factor which might be chosen such that for @xmath44 the density @xmath45 is obtained .",
    "here we choose @xmath46 , which means that in momentum space we deal with the total charge instead of charge density .",
    "let us consider first the scalar term involved in the expression of the charge density .",
    "taking into account the fact that the volume conservation restriction yields a relation between the monopole and quadrupole coordinates ,    @xmath47    one obtains : @xmath48 quantizing the quadrupole collective coordinate we can define the transition monopole operator , @xmath49 .",
    "the elastic monopole form - factor is obtained as the expectation value of @xmath49 on the ground state wave function in the collective space .",
    "here we consider alternatively the unprojected ground state and the projected states describing the @xmath50-members of the ground band . in order to calculate the expectation values of the monopole charge density operator in the states mentioned above",

    "one may ask oneself what is the relative contribution of these terms to the total charge for non - vanishing @xmath42 values . we addressed this question by studying the ratios @xmath99 as function of @xmath100 for two values of the deformation parameter @xmath63 .",
    "thus , from fig .",
    "4 we see that the term depending on deformation may affect the charge of the ground state at most by 15% for @xmath101 . in the state with j=20 and the quoted value of @xmath100",
    "the deformation relative contribution is of 40% .",
    "for large nuclear deformation , d=3.2195 , the relative contribution of the deformation is ranging from zero to 5% when @xmath100 is increased from 0 to 2 .",
    "now let us focus our attention on the monopole transition @xmath7 .",
    "the transition amplitude was calculated with eq.([rhoe0 ] ) .",
    "we notice that the monopole transition operator @xmath102 has an expression identical with that supplied by the liquid drop model . however , the wave functions are specific to gcsm and they may describe the spherical and deformed nuclei in a unified way .",
    "another feature which is specific to our description is the canonicity parameter @xmath53 defining the equations which relate the coordinates and conjugate momenta to the boson operators . within the liquid drop model in its original form",
    "the canonicity parameter is chosen such that the boson hamiltonian does not contain a term like @xmath103 .",
    "this idea is not applicable to gcsm , since the starting hamiltonian is anharmonic and , moreover , is considered in the boson picture . here",

    "note the fact that this condition is fulfilled automatically in microscopic models where a many body slater determinant is eigenstate of the charge density operator .",
    "for a low momentum regime , the mentioned condition provides @xmath105 ; c ) as in ref.@xcite i.e. , @xmath106 with @xmath107 fixed from the equation obtained by equating the expressions of the asymptotic energies in the ground band and that of the liquid drop model in the large deformation regime .",

    "these discrepancies could be attributed to the fact that the collective coordinates respond differently to the interaction with longitudinal and transverse components of the electromagnetic external field , respectively .",
    "the former components may determine a e0 excitation while the latter one can excite the nuclei through , for example , a @xmath112 transition .",
    "the observation that different kappa s are needed to reproduce e2 and e0 properties reflects the fact that these are independent quantities .",

    "the procedure c ) might be suitable to fix the strength for the quadrupole component of the charge density operator but not for the scalar component strength .",
    "an essential point in understanding these discrepancies is the fact that in ref.@xcite the quadrupole transition operator involves also the polarization effects of the neutron systems .",
    "therefore the e2 transition is achieved by a combined contribution of proton and neutron systems . here only the contribution of protons is considered and therefore the method c ) of fixing @xmath53 is not adequate .",
    "we would like to mention that the model hamiltonian used by gcsm ( 2.4 ) is a fourth order boson hamiltonian , while the charge density expansion in collective quadrupole coordinates is truncated to second order .",
    "this lack of consistency might be another source for the discrepancy between the values of @xmath53 obtained here and those given in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the set of nuclei considered in the present paper involves a chain of even isotopes of gd . along this chain",
    "the shape undertakes a transition from a spherical to a deformed one .",
    "the critical point of this transition is met in @xmath113gd @xcite . in the group theory language",

    "recently it has been suggested that the critical point corresponds to a new symmetry called x(5 ) symmetry @xcite . this shape transition has been also studied within the gcsm formalism in ref.@xcite .",

    "note that the experimental results exhibit , indeed , a maximum for a=154 .",
    "the theoretical results have been interpolated by a fourth order polynomial which presents an inflexion point for the critical value of a. thus , we may say that the shape transition is reflected by the fact that an inflexion point shows up in the behavior of the transition amplitude .",
    "the bump seen at @xmath113gd can not be obtained in the present model since @xmath53 is depending linearly on the deformation parameter which is varying smoothly with the atomic number .",
    "actually it is hard to say whether the behavior of the energy ratio @xmath114 is the most suited criterion for deciding whether a phase transition is taking place or not . in the gd case",
    "the _ critical _ nucleus @xmath113gd has a static quadrupole deformation of about 0.25 while for the preceding isotope @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the fact that @xmath2 for @xmath113gd is larger than the values corresponding to the neighboring isotopes might be determined not by the transition from a spherical to deformed shapes , which is not the case as we mentioned before , but by another cause . as a matter of fact in ref.@xcite , the analysis of the hamiltonian structure coefficients as function of the atomic mass suggests that a phase transition is possible to take place in @xmath116gd and not @xmath113gd .",
    "the bump which is seen for @xmath113gd could be explained by adding the neutron contribution to the e0 transitions .",
    "indeed the data from the last column of table ii , which correspond to the method c ) of fixing @xmath53 , indicate a bump for @xmath117gd .    concerning the model capacity of describing the nuclear shape coexistence , we have derived a compact formula relating the @xmath118 transition amplitude with the mixing coefficient of the states describing the nuclear system with different shapes . indeed , calculating the average value of the static quadrupole moment with the projected state @xmath0 ,",
    "one finds a value which is different from that corresponding to @xmath1 .",

    "as mentioned before , mixing states corresponding to different shapes may be used to improve the description of the e0 transitions . in this context",
    "we invoke some microscopic calculations for nuclear charge radii and electric quadrupole moments @xcite which predict for the even isotopes of @xmath96 oblate equilibrium shapes whose energies are by about 1.5 to 5 mev larger than the prolate shape energies .",

    "indeed , sk3 calculation predicts a prolate ground state and an oblate state with an excitation energy of about 0.5 mev . on the other hand the use of sg2 interaction leads to an oblate ground state and a prolate excited equilibrium minimum with the energy of about 1mev . although the prolate deformation is quite large ( @xmath123 ) the first excited @xmath10 is relatively high ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "the deformation parameter which provides a good description of the ground band energies is @xmath125 .",
    "this deformation value determines a transition amplitude equal to 7.78 @xmath126 .",
    "taking for the experimental transition amplitude the value @xmath127 , as given in ref.@xcite , we found for the mixing amplitude the values @xmath128 .",
    "in the previous sections we described the results obtained within the gcsm model concerning the charge density as well as the monopole transition amplitude . the main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the expectation values of the scalar charge density on the unprojected and angular momentum projected states were evaluated at different q values .",
    "angular momentum projection effects are unnoticeable for @xmath61 , irrespective of deformation . for larger angular momentum ( j=20 , as an example )",
    "projection gives sizable effects for small values of deformation .",
    "this agrees with results of microscopic studies by zaringhalam and negele @xcite .    concerning the @xmath118 transition amplitude , a quite good agreement with data",
    "was obtained for @xmath129 for most nuclei considered . for this value",
    "the unprojected ground state is an eigenstate of the charge density operator in the low momentum regime .",
    "a discrepancy is obtained for @xmath109er and @xmath110yb , where the value @xmath111 , which obeys the stability equation for the charge of the system when the transfer momentum is small , seems to be more suitable .",
    "employing for @xmath53 the values corresponding to a realistic description of both , the m1 and e2 properties @xcite , one obtains for the monopole transition amplitudes values which are larger than the experimental data by a factor 2.6 to 5 .",
    "these large deviations are interpreted as being caused by the different responses of the nuclear quadrupole coordinates to the interaction with the transverse and longitudinal components of an external electromagnetic field , respectively .",
    "the fact that @xmath53 obtained here and in ref.@xcite are different is not an inedit puzzle .",
    "we recall that the nuclear deformation obtained by fitting the hydrodynamic moment of inertia is very different from the one obtained by fitting the reduced probability for the transition @xmath130 .",
    "we also addressed the questions whether the @xmath118 transition amplitude might bring information about shape transitions as well as about shapes coexistence .",
    "indeed , we notice that for @xmath113gd , where the critical point for the spherical to deformed shape transition is met , the transition amplitude @xmath2 exhibits an inflexion .",
    "we suspect that a better method of fixing the parameter @xmath53 would yield for the mentioned function a maximum value for the critical value @xmath131 , as actually happens for the experimental data .",
    "we derived a compact formula relating the @xmath118 transition amplitude with the mixing coefficient of the states describing the nuclear system with different shapes .",
    "this formula may be used to calculate the mixing amplitude once we know the transition amplitude .",
    "reversely , assuming the state mixing one can calculate the e0 transition amplitude relating the two independent mixed states .",
    "actually we made the option for the second manner of using the mentioned formula and applied it for the isotopes of gd and @xmath122kr .",
    "we pointed out that the mixing amplitude could serve as signature for the shape transition in the gd isotopes . indeed for @xmath113gd we found out that there is no real solution for the mixing amplitude .",
    "very recently , a paper addressing similar issues , but within the iba approach , showed up @xcite .",
    "the expression of @xmath2 obtained therein depends on proton and neutron effective charges and a parameter which is fixed by fitting the peaks of isotope shift .",
    "due to the way of fixing the two parameters the bump seen for @xmath113gd is reproduced by the calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , by contrast , we do nt use effective charges and we do not have a parameter which is fixed by fitting the peaks in the isotope shift , which is a phenomenon closely related to the e0 properties . despite these differences , both descriptions provide results for the @xmath118 transitions in @xmath96 isotopes , which agree with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the agreements obtained in the two descriptions are of similar quality .",
    "exception is for the bump which shows up at @xmath113gd .",
    "indeed , our calculations predict an inflexion point rather than a bump . for comparison the two sets of results , ours and those of ref.@xcite for @xmath96 isotopes were represented on the same graph , in fig .",
    "finally , one could assert that the gcsm model provides results for the diagonal matrix elements of the charge density operator , which are consistent with the microscopic studies @xcite . also , the model is able to realistically describe the @xmath118 transitions for the eleven nuclei considered in the present paper .",
    "comments are made upon the signatures of nuclear shape phase transition as well of shape coexistence which might be found in the monopole charge transition .",
