    "all studies of the compressibility of interstellar turbulence decompose the velocity , @xmath19 , rather than the momentum , @xmath20 , into solenoidal and compressive modes , and refer to the compressibility of the driving acceleration , rather than that of the driving force ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the sn explosion energy is deposited as thermal energy in small , randomly - selected spheres , so it is initially injected via the pressure term in the navier - stokes equation . denoting as @xmath21 the pressure source due to sn explosions",
    ", the effective driving force and acceleration can be written as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . although the effective force , @xmath22 , is purely compressive , the driving acceleration , @xmath23 , is not so , in general . clearly , the divergence and the curl of this effective acceleration , @xmath23 , are given , respectively , by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the latter , known as the baroclinic effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is nonzero in general . in particular , considering random density and pressure fluctuations outside a sn - explosion sphere , the baroclinic term is always nonzero at the boundary of such a sphere .",
    "therefore , the effective acceleration for sn driving is neither purely compressive nor purely solenoidal , rather it consists of a mixture of solenoidal and compressive modes",
    ". if the direction of @xmath26 is random with respect to @xmath27 , the divergence and curl of @xmath23 are comparable , suggesting similar amounts of solenoidal and compressive modes in the effective acceleration . with the expansion of the remnant ,",
    "solenoidal motions generated around the pressure  sources \" are transferred to larger scales .",
    "for example , a single sn remnant leads to an energy spectrum that peaks at a wavenumber @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the remnant radius ( see paper i ) .",

    "while the remnant expansion brings the velocity power to large scales , the nonlinear advection term causes cascades of both solenoidal and compressive modes towards small scales .",
    "if the sn rate is not too high and there is sufficient time in between sn events to allow the flow to fully develop , a dynamically quasi - relaxed state is reached . during the relaxation phase",
    ", one might expect the interaction between solenoidal and compressive modes via the nonlinear term to establish an equipartition between the two modes in the inertial range , as seen in simulations adopting an isothermal equation of state and purely solenoidal driving",
    ". however , this inertial - range equipartition is not observed in our simulation , because , in the relaxation phase , the baroclinic effect preferentially converts compressive modes ( shocks or expansions ) to solenoidal motions .",
    "due to its dependence on density and pressure gradients , the baroclinic effect is more efficient at smaller scales , and , as a result , the compressive spectrum decreases towards small scales faster than the solenoidal one ( see figure 8 in paper i ) . as a consequence , at scales corresponding to mc sizes ,",
    "the ratio of compressive to solenoidal power is , on average , below the equipartition value of 0.5 .",
    "the goal of this work is to derive the distribution of the compressive ratio of sn - driven turbulence in mcs and the corresponding amplitude and probability distribution of density fluctuations .",
    "mcs may have non - negligible mean radial motions ( expansion or contraction ) and overall rotation .",
    "although these mean motions can be considered as the large - scale components of mc turbulence , it is nonetheless interesting to examine their importance relative to the random motions . in the next section",

    "the actual cloud may cover only a small fraction of the total volume of its bounding box , so the velocity field we analyze includes lower - density , possibly warmer , gas .",
    "the inclusion of this surrounding gas in the analysis of the velocity field is justified because the dynamical evolution of the cloud involves the surrounding region , with lower density gas accreting onto the cloud , and denser gas expanding out of the cloud .",

    "the histograms show that @xmath37 is typically only 10 - 20% of @xmath45 . for expanding ( @xmath46 ) clouds , @xmath47 and 0.19 , in the cases with and without gravity respectively , while for contracting ( @xmath30 ) clouds , @xmath48 in both cases .",
    "the comparison of the mean values for contracting clouds with and without gravity and their very similar histograms shown in figure [ vex_hist ] demonstrate that , despite the presence of self - gravity causing the collapse of their dense cores , mcs do not undergo global collapse .",
    "however , the fraction of clouds that are contracting ( rather than expanding ) is 0.62 with gravity and 0.45 without gravity , suggesting that gravity may be causing a global contraction in at least a fraction of the clouds ( even if their kinetic energy is dominated by random motions ) .    , and compressive power , @xmath49 , normalized to their values when the clouds are extracted at the maximum resolution , @xmath50 and @xmath51    the rate of the overall rotation of a cloud can be characterized by an angular velocity @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the average vorticity in the cloud .",

    "the comparison with figure [ vex_hist ] also illustrates that the solid - body rotation of the clouds contains more energy than the overall expansion or contraction , perhaps because the rotation has a larger number of degrees of freedom than the mean radial motion .",

    "figure 8 of paper i shows that a value of approximately 0.3 is consistent with the time - averaged value of @xmath132 at a scale of approximately 48 pc .",
    "the broad distribution of @xmath58 can be understood by considering the amplitudes , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , of the solenoidal and compressive velocities at the cloud size . if @xmath135 is close to the energy injection scale , @xmath136 , the distributions of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are roughly gaussian .",
    "since the compressive power ratio is related to the ratio of @xmath137 , and the ratio of two gaussian variables has a distribution much broader than gaussian , one expects @xmath58 to show a broad , non - gaussian distribution , as found in section 5 .",
    "furthermore , at scales @xmath135 below @xmath136 , the solenoidal and compressive velocity amplitudes , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , would become non - gaussian due to turbulent intermittency .",
    "this tends to make the distribution of the ratio @xmath140 at small scales ( and hence the distribution of @xmath58 for smaller clouds ) even more non - gaussian with fatter tails .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the sn - driven simulation of interstellar turbulence presented in paper i , focusing on the statistics of the compressive ratio of the turbulence within mcs .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .   the estimated compressive ratio of sn - driven turbulence within mcs follows a broad lognormal distribution , with the average @xmath141 in the case with gravity , and @xmath142 without gravity , comparable to the value found in isothermal simulations with random solenoidal driving and sonic or alfvnic mach numbers @xmath78 , and significantly lower than in isothermal simulations with purely compressive driving .",
    "self - gravity does not affect the compressive ratio significantly .",
    "the mean expansion or contraction velocity , @xmath37 , in the clouds is , on average , only a small fraction of the total rms velocity , with @xmath48 for the contraction velocity of both clouds with and without self - gravity .",
    "thus , even in the presence of self - gravity , mcs do not collapse as a whole .",
    "however , the fraction of clouds that are contracting grows from 45% to 62% after gravity is included .",
    "3 .   the cloud solid - body rotation velocity is larger than the mean radial velocity , but still a small fraction of the total rms velocity on average , with @xmath143 and 0.27 for clouds before and after the inclusion of self - gravity .",
    "thus , cloud rotation is not significantly affected by gravity either .",
    "4 .   the amplitude of the density fluctuations in mcs follows approximately a similar @xmath92 @xmath144 relation as in idealized simulations with random driving , but with a very large scatter around the mean @xmath92 @xmath144 curve .",
    "although significant deviations may exist for individual mcs , the composite gas density pdf obtained by the combination of the normalized pdfs of all clouds , in the absence of gravity , is very well described by a lognormal distribution , over nearly seven orders of magnitude for the probability at the high - density tail .",
    "once gravity is included in the simulation , the pdf develops a power - law high - density tail , @xmath145 , due to the presence of collapsing cores .",
    "our results demonstrate that numerical studies of mc turbulence on small to intermediate scales , which attempt to imitate the effect of the ism turbulent cascade by using a large - scale random acceleration , should adopt a driving scheme resulting in values of @xmath81 consistent with its distribution derived here , assuming sn explosions are the main driving mechanism of the ism turbulence .",
    "this distribution should also be accounted for when modeling star formation with statistics of supersonic turbulence .",
