    "by far the study of neutron stars has been mainly focused on the relationship between the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter and the observed maximum mass .",
    "the connection has been achieved by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equations based on general relativity .",
    "the first generation observed masses exhibited an average value around 1.5 solar masses .",
    "this value requires a soft eos that can be easily obtained by introducing new degrees of freedom like hyperons , kaons or quarks accompanied or not by a phase transition .",
    "sometimes the softening was so large that the neutron star is predicted to collapse into a black hole , as for the sn1987a @xcite . in the new generation of observations",
    "the masses are distributed within a large range , up to 2 solar masses , that requires a stiff eos , i.e. , hadronic matter without new degrees of freedom . since it is hard to imagine pure hadronic matter to sustain the high pressure predicted in the inner core , new scenarios have to be advanced to explain the coexistence , in the phenomenology of neutron stars , of low and high mass spectra .",
    "recently @xcite it has been argued that the two observed classes of neutron stars might correspond to two different evolutionary scenarios of neutron stars . in one case , the hot and dense remnant of the supernova explosion rapidly evolves into a hybrid star , where the transition to a quark phase softens the nuclear matter so that @xmath0 ; in the other case a slow evolution could lead the neutron star to a large mass via a mass accreting from the coupling with a white dwarf . from this point of view the destiny of the remnant",
    "is strongly affected by the initial conditions , i.e. density , temperature , leptonization degree etc .",
    "for instance , if the mass of the remnant is below the mass threshold for quark nucleation the transition to the quark phase is forbidden @xcite . if the mass is slowly accreting the transition is allowed .",
    "the role of temperature or other parameters defining the initial state of a new born neutron star has not yet been studied .    to investigate the possible phase transition to quark matter in neutron stars",
    ", we need also to know the eos of quark matter .",
    "although we have in hand the fundamental theory of strong interactions , i.e. , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , we still do not know the true ground state .",
    "it is now generally expected that quark matter is in the color - flavor locked phase ( cfl ) @xcite at extremely high densities when the finite current mass of strange quarks becomes unimportant . in the density range from nuclear saturation to cfl , there may exist a rich and varied landscape of phases , e.g. , the 2sc , g2sc , gcfl etc .",
    "presently , however , these phases suffer from the so - called chromomagnetic instability problem for both the two- @xcite and three - flavor @xcite cases . on the other hand , experiments show that quarks become asymptotically free rather slowly @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present study we are dealing with the ordinary strange quark matter ( sqm ) @xcite .    the special problem in studying the eos of ordinary quark matter is to treat quark confinement in a proper way . in the conventional standard approach , an extra constant term",
    ", the famous bag constant @xmath1 , is added to the energy density of the system , which provides a negative pressure to confine quarks within a finite volume , usually called a ` bag ' .",
    "the quark mass is infinitely large outside the bag , and a finite constant within the bag",
    ". a vast quantity of investigation have been performed within the framework of the bag model @xcite .    as is well known , however , particle masses vary with environment .",
    "such masses are usually called effective masses .",
    "effective masses of hadrons and quarks have been extensively discussed , e.g. , within the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite and within a quasi - particle model @xcite . in principle",
    ", the density dependence of quark masses should be connected to the in - medium chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the density dependence , one can describe quark confinement without using the bag constant .",
    "instead , the quark confinement is achieved by the density dependence of the quark masses derived from in - medium chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "the two most important aspects in this model are the quark mass scaling  @xcite and the thermodynamic treatment  @xcite .",
    "both aspects will be reviewed in this paper .    in the present contribution",
    ", the transition from hadron phase ( hp ) to strange quark phase ( sqp ) in the inner core of a neutron star is investigated within the fully consistent nuclear and quark models . in the hadron sector",
    "we adopt the equation of state from brueckner - bethe - goldstone ( bbg ) approach with three - body forces ( tbf ) @xcite .",
    "this theory , being a completely microscopic approach , can easily incorporate degrees of freedom such as nucleon resonances [ @xmath2(1232 ) or @xmath3(1440 ) ] , which are expected to appear at higher hadron densities . it is found that the mixed hadron - quark phase can occur , for reasonable values of the confinement parameter , a little above the normal saturation density , and can undergo the transition to pure quark matter at about 5 - 6 times the saturation .",
    "this result is quite different from the previous results from nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in which the mixed quark phase can not appear at neutron - star densities  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the influence of the mixed and quark phases on the structure of compact stars is discussed by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation and extracting the mass - radius plots for neutron stars .",
    "finally , it is shown that the transition to the deconfined phase turns out to be incompatible with the onset of kaon condensation .",
    "sqm has been one of the hot topics in nuclear physics since witten s famous stability conjecture @xcite . in many studies ,",
    "the quark confinement was treated adopting the bag mechanism @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to obtain confinement is based on the density dependence of quark masses @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively applied to investigating the properties of sqm @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we first give a short review of the two most important aspects , with the main inconsistency of the original model .",
    "then we present a fully self - consistent thermodynamic treatment .",
    "the properties of sqm will be given in the new treatment .",
    "in the present paper , however , the main application of the new approach is the study of the phase transition in compact stars .",
    "as mentioned above , the quark confinement in this model is achieved by the density dependence of quark masses .",
    "therefore , the first important question is how to determine the quark mass scaling which can reasonably produce confinement .",
    "originally , the interaction part of the quark masses was assumed to be inversely proportional to the density @xcite .",
    "this linear scaling has been extensively applied to studying the properties of sqm .",
    "there are also other mass scalings @xcite .",
    "their main drawback is that they are pure parametrizations without any convincing derivation .",
    "therefore , a cubic scaling was derived based on the in - medium chiral condensates and linear confinement at both zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "this new scaling has been applied to investigate the viscosity of sqm and the damping time scale that is due to the coupling of the viscosity and r mode @xcite , the quark - diquark equation of state and compact star structure @xcite , the properties of strangelets versus the electric charge and strangeness @xcite , and the new solutions for cfl slets @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the chirally determined quark mass scaling  @xcite to study the phase transition in neutron stars . for this",
    "we need a completely self - consistent thermodynamic treatment of the eos of quark matter .",
    "the thermodynamic treatment of the system with confinement via the density dependent quark masses has been a long story .",
    "originally , the thermodynamic formulism was regarded the same as the constant - mass case @xcite . in this first treatment ,",
    "the internal pressure can not be zero , and the properties of sqm were rather different from those in the bag model .",
    "but it was later pointed out that the difference was caused by the incorrect thermodynamic treatment  @xcite .",
    "it was found that an additional term is to be added to the pressure and energy expressions @xcite .",
    "this second treatment makes it possible sqm to be self - bound .",
    "however , two serious problems came out : one is the unreasonable vacuum limits , the other one is the discrepancy between the energy minimum and zero pressure .",
    "it was shown that the added term in the pressure , due to the density dependence of quark masses , should not be appended to the energy . after discarding this term in the energy , while keeping it in the pressure ,",
    "the two inconsistencies mentioned above were immediately removed @xcite .",
    "this third treatment has recently been extended to finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic formulism in ref .",
    "@xcite was also adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , though a different quark mass scaling was used there .",
    "a common feature of the last two thermodynamic treatments  @xcite , as well as other recent references using this model @xcite , is that they all regard the thermodynamic potential the same as in the fermi gas model .",
    "because of the additional term , the pressure becomes obviously not equal to the minus thermodynamic potential density , contradicting the thermodynamic equality @xmath4 for a homogeneous system .",
    "one can also easily check that the fundamental differentiation equality @xmath5 for homogeneous systems at zero temperature was not fulfilled in the mentioned references .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we will present a fully self - consistent thermodynamic treatment of the confinement by density - dependent mass model ( cddm ) .",
    "let us consider a quark model with three flavors . denoting the fermi momentum in the phase space by @xmath6 , the particle number densities",
    "can then be expressed as @xmath7 and the energy density as @xmath8    equations ( [ nimod ] ) and ( [ emod ] ) are familiar expressions , where the summation index goes over all considered particle types . to let the model be valid for both particles and anti - particles , the particle number density , or accordingly ,",
    "the fermi momentum , are formally assumed to be negative for anti - particles .",
    "therefore , in the upper limit of the integration , the absolute value has to be taken .    if the particle masses @xmath9 are constant , the relation between the fermi momenta @xmath6 and the chemical potentials @xmath10 is @xmath11    as is well - known , however , the quark mass depends on density and temperature . in principle , the quark mass scaling should be determined from qcd , which is obviously impossible presently .",
    "based on the in - medium chiral condensates , a cubic scaling law was derived at zero temperature @xcite , and it has been recently extended to finite temperature @xcite . at zero temperature , we have the simple cubic scaling @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the quark current mass , @xmath14 is the total baryon number density , the exponent of density is @xmath15 @xcite , and the constant @xmath16 is to be discussed a bit later .    in the following , we show that the density - dependence of particle masses will modify the fermi momentum , i.e.the relation in eq .",
    "( [ nuimuifree ] ) for free - particle systems should be modified to include interactions .",
    "in fact for the quark flavor @xmath17 we have @xmath18 since the quark masses are density dependent , the derivatives generate an additional term with respect to the free fermi gas model .",
    "we get @xmath19 where @xmath20.\\ ] ] the pressure is then given by @xmath21 with @xmath22  being the free - particle contribution : @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the additional term in the chemical potential , the pressure also has an extra term .",
    "the inclusion of such a term guarantees that the hughenoltz - van hove theorem is fulfilled in the calculations .    in the quasi - particle model @xcite",
    ", one also has an extra term .",
    "because the quark masses there depend on chemical potentials , and the extra term is not used in the relation between the fermi momenta and chemical potentials , an effective bag constant has to be added to the energy expression to consider confinement @xcite .    in cddm quark model , however",
    ", we do not need a bag constant any more .",
    "quark confinement is achieved automatically by the density dependence of quark masses , or by the strong interaction between quarks .",
    "in fact , the exponent @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ mqt0 ] ) is derived from the linear confinement interaction @xcite .        in the present model ,",
    "the parameters are : the electron mass @xmath25 mev , the quark current masses @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and the confinement parameter @xmath16 . although the light - quark masses are not without controversy and remain under active investigations , they are anyway very small , and so we simply take @xmath29 the current mass of strange quarks is @xmath30 mev according to the latest version of the particle data group @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the stability of strange quark matter ( sqm ) is judged by the minimum energy per baryon @xcite .",
    "if it is less than 930 mev ( the mass of @xmath31fe divided by 56 ) , then sqm is absolutely stable .",
    "if it is bigger than 930 mev but less than 939 mev ( the mass of nucleons ) , then it is metastable .",
    "otherwise , if it is larger than 939 mev , sqm is un - stable . in case of two - flavor",
    "quark matter , it should be no less than 930 mev , in order not to contradict standard nuclear physics .",
    "this is the witten - bodmer hypothesis @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ dms0 ] , we show the different regimes in the @xmath32-@xmath28 plane . the area below the full line is forbidden where the energy per baryon of two - flavor quark matter is less than 930 mev .",
    "above the dotted line , the energy per baryon of sqm is more than 939 mev , and thus sqm is unstable .",
    "the area bounded by the dotted and dashed lines is the metastable region where the energy per baryon is between 930 mev and 939 mev .",
    "only when the @xmath33 pair is in the range between the full and dashed lines , sqm can be absolutely stable , i.e. , its energy per baryon is less than 930 mev .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath16 values is very narrow for a chosen @xmath28 value , if the witten - bodmer hypothesis is correct . if we take the modest value @xmath34 mev , for example , then @xmath35 is in the range of 158160 mev .",
    "the lower bound 158 mev is obtained by taking @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given a small finite value , the lower bound can then be a little bit smaller , e.g. 156 mev @xcite .",
    "unfortunately we presently do not have a definite conclusion on the stability of sqm , so we treat @xmath16 as a free parameter .",
    "however , the first condition , i.e. , @xmath16 greater than about @xmath37 , should always be satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , we can connect @xmath16 to the pion mass @xmath38 , pion decay constant @xmath39 , pion - nucleon sigma term @xmath40 , string tension @xmath41 , and the vacuum chiral condensate @xmath42 by @xcite @xmath43 from the known range of the vacuum condensate , we can have an upper bound @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 should not be out of the range ( 156 , 270 ) mev .      as usually done , we consider sqm as a mixture of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 quarks , and electrons .",
    "the relevant chemical potentials @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 satisfy the weak - equilibrium condition @xmath52    because all particle masses do not depend on the density of electrons , i.e. , @xmath53 , eq .",

    "<S> we study the properties of strange quark matter in equilibrium with normal nuclear matter . instead of using the conventional bag model in quark sector , we achieve the confinement by a density - dependent quark mass derived from in - medium chiral condensates . in nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> , we adopt the equation of state from the brueckner - bethe - goldstone approach with three - body forces . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the mixed phase can occur , for a reasonable confinement parameter , near the normal nuclear saturation density , and goes over into pure quark matter at about 5 times the saturation . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of mixed and quark phases is compatible with the observed class of low - mass neutron stars , but it hinders the occurrence of kaon condensation . </S>"
