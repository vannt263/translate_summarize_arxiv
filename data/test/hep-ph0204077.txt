    "assuming that neutrinos have a small mass and mix is by far the simplest solution to the two well established solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrino puzzles and the more controversial lsnd anomaly @xcite .",
    "it is , however , well known that in order to solve all three problems at once , one is required to add new light degrees of freedom to the standard model ( sm ) , usually sterile neutrinos .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the solar neutrino puzzle ( snp ) requires a neutrino mass - squared difference @xmath1  ev@xmath2 , the atmospheric neutrino puzzle ( anp ) requires @xmath3  ev@xmath2 , and the lsnd anomaly ( la ) requires @xmath4  ev@xmath2 . with three neutrino mass eigenstates ,",
    "one can only obtain two independent mass - squared differences .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that there is another way to address all neutrino puzzles with only three neutrino species : cpt violation @xcite .",
    "it is easy to note that , while the snp involves neutrinos , the la points to evidence for oscillation only in antineutrinos , meaning that if the @xmath5 s were different in the neutrino and antineutrino sectors , the three problems could be solved without the addition of light degrees of freedom to the sm .",
    "furthermore , cpt violation in the neutrino sector have also been evoked as a possible solution to inconsistencies in the neutrino data from sn1987a @xcite .",
    "cpt is the only global space - time symmetry of the sm . unlike its `` broken siblings '' ( c , p , t , cp , ct , pt ) , however , cpt invariance is not an accidental / optional symmetry of a quantum field theoretical system .",
    "cpt invariance is a consequence of the fact that all microscopic phenomena observed to date can be perfectly described by a lorentz invariant , local quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "cpt violation implies , necessarily , violation of lorentz invariance and/or locality ( and , perhaps , a formalism different from quantum field theory ... ) .",
    "it has recently been stressed @xcite that allowing particle and antiparticles to have different masses seems to imply that _ both _ lorentz invariance and locality are violated .",
    "cpt violating effects can be mimicked by neutrino interactions with a cpt violating medium .",
    "indeed , neutrinos and antineutrinos acquired different _ effective _ masses while propagating in the presence of matter , such that large matter induced cpt violating effects can be potentially observed in future neutrino experiments .",
    "the authors of @xcite have mentioned that one may be able to parameterize the cpt violating effects by assuming the existence of a cpt violating _ ether _ , which modifies the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos in distinct ways .",
    "certain advantages come out of such a parameterization : the theory remains local ( only lorentz invariance is violated ) , and all well known quantum field theoretical techniques can be safely used to explore other consequences of the postulated cpt violation ",
    "cpt violating effects are parametrized by an effective lagrangian .",
    "i argue , by performing a two - flavor analysis , that the neutrino puzzles and the la probably can not be solved in a satisfactory way by assuming the existence of a `` cpt violating ether . ''",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the current neutrino data already may set very strong limits on particular cpt violating operators @xcite , while potentially stronger limits may be imposed by future neutrino experiments , such as kamland @xcite and borexino @xcite .    in sec .  2 ,",
    "the cpt violating formalism is introduced and motivated . in sec .  3",
    ", i discuss what are the requirements for solving the snp and the la within the formalism introduced in sec .  2 , and show why it does not work properly , at least in a two - flavor analysis .",
    "i comment briefly on whether one should expect a three - flavor analysis to be more successful .",
    "sec .  4 contains a summary of the results and some discussions , including current and future constraints on cpt violation .",
    "for simplicity , i ll assume that the neutrinos are majorana particles , and describe it using two - component weyl spinors .",
    "this being the case , after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a two - component ( left - handed ) weyl field , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 contains all the interaction terms .. this would , however , imply in a non hermitian hamiltonian for the neutrino  antineutrino system . ]    in the spirit of @xcite , we assume that possible cpt violating effects are a consequence of unknown ultraviolet physics , and that they are small ( as required by experiments ) .",
    "this allows one to write cpt violating effective operators , which are proportional to some order parameter ( v.e.v ) and suppressed by powers of the new physics scale .",
    "this formalism is particularly useful if lorentz invariance ( and cpt ) is spontaneously broken @xcite . as has been argued in @xcite , this implies that the lagrangian is still invariant under `` observer lorentz transformations , '' and only `` particle lorentz invariance '' is violated .",
    "i refer readers to @xcite for more detailed discussions",
    ". therefore , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the new physics scale , @xmath13 are dimensionless coupling constants , @xmath14 is the cpt violating order parameter and @xmath15 are operators composed of the sm fields with mass dimension @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 is a lorentz invariant operator of mass dimension @xmath18 . the lowest dimensional cpt violating operator comes at @xmath19 @xcite , and is parametrized as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a _ constant _ , real four - vector with mass dimension 1 .",
    "note that there are no other @xmath19 cpt violating terms .",
    "hence forth , we ignore all other terms , which are suppressed by powers of @xmath22 , and work with the lagrangian @xmath23    @xmath21 can be interpreted in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , it looks like a background , classical `` electromagnetic '' field . in the case of neutrinos",
    ", it proves useful to interpret it as a `` matter potential . ''",
    "this is because , in the case of electron neutrinos propagating in the presence of , say , nonrelativistic electrons , one obtains exactly @xmath20 , with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron number density .    from eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , one obtains the modified dirac equations @xmath26^{\\dot{\\alpha}\\alpha}\\chi_{\\alpha}- m^*\\bar{\\chi}^{\\dot{\\alpha}}=0 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "( i\\partial_{\\mu}+a_{\\mu})[\\sigma^{\\mu } ] _ { \\dot{\\alpha}\\alpha}\\bar{\\chi}^{\\dot{\\alpha}}-m\\chi_{\\alpha}=0 , \\label{dirac_eqs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 are spinor indices , and @xmath28 . from eqs .",
    "( [ dirac_eqs ] ) , one can calculate the dispersion relation for both the neutrino ( positive energy state ) and the antineutrino ( negative energy state ) .",
    "the general expression is rather cumbersome ( it turn out to be a forth order polynomial dispersion relation ) and can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath29 is time - like . ] and consider the limit @xmath30 ( this is the limit i ll be strictly interested in , as will become clear in the next section ) such that @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath31 where the plus sign applies for the neutrino and the minus sign for the antineutrino .",
    "the opposite sign for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos is easy to understand if one looks at @xmath21 as a background classical vector field  particle and antiparticle have opposite charge .",
    "as one can readily notice , @xmath32 can be interpreted as a `` potential energy '' and will be referred to henceforth as an `` ether - potential . ''",
    "( [ disp_rel ] ) has also been derived by several authors in the case of neutrinos propagating in several media @xcite . in the case of ordinary matter effects",
    ", @xmath32 is sometimes related to an `` effective mass . ''",
    "we comment on this interpretation in the next section , and argue that it can be rather misleading .",
    "the la can be interpreted as a measurement of @xmath33-conversion with @xmath34 .",
    "the neutrino energies explored range ( roughly ) from 30  mev to 55  mev , and the neutrino travel distance is @xmath35  m. an interpretation in terms of two - flavor neutrino oscillations indicates , after including constraints from other experiments , that @xmath36  ev@xmath2 , while @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the snp is best interpreted by @xmath38-conversion , with @xmath39 .",
    "the neutrino energies explored range ( roughly ) from 0.1  mev to 10  mev , and the neutrino travel distance is ( of course ) one astronomical unit , and there is information regarding the survival probability as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "most importantly , the presence of matter inside the sun and the earth affects the oscillation pattern significantly .",
    "an interpretation in terms of two - flavor neutrino oscillations indicates , after including constraints from other experiments , that @xmath40  ev@xmath2 , while @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the question one would like to address is whether the presence of the lorentz - invariant violating operators described in the previous section can solve both the la and the snp .",
    "i will restrict the discussion to two - flavor oscillations .",
    "this simplifying assumption will render the discussion more clear , and can easily be extended to the three neutrino case .",
    "note that the two - flavor case does fit trivially into a three flavor framework if one chooses the ether - potentials to act only on the `` 12 '' system , and that there is no @xmath42 on the `` 3 '' mass eigenstate .",
    "the differential equation that will lead to the oscillations in the presence of an electron number density @xmath25 can be written as ( assuming that the neutrino energy is much larger than its mass and dropping terms proportional to the identity matrix ) @xmath43 \\left(\\matrix{\\nu_{e } \\cr \\nu_{x } } \\right ) , \\label{de_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the ether - potentials ( as defined in the previous section ) , @xmath46 is a linear combination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the equation for antineutrinos is identical to eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for _ fixed _ @xmath52 the entire solar neutrino parameter space is spanned by assuming @xmath53 after one defines the sign of @xmath5 @xcite . however , since we will be trying to determine @xmath52 from neutrino data , their sign can be adjusted such that @xmath54 , as customary .",
    "can not be ignored due to standard matter effects @xcite . ]    in the absence of matter effects , the oscillation probability is ( these have already been presented in @xcite ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is assumed real henceforth .    for solar neutrinos",
    ", we will concentrate on solutions where the adiabatic condition for propagation inside the sun holds ( this will always be the case here , as will be argued later ) , such that , for a neutrino produced close to the sun s core , @xmath59 with @xmath60 the electron number density in the sun s core , which translates into @xmath61  ev@xmath62mev .",
    "the next step is to search for @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that both the la and snp are solved , and such that other experimental results are not contradicted .",
    "first , i address the case @xmath65 .",
    "the la requires @xmath66 , assuming that @xmath67 , such that the atmospheric neutrino puzzle is solved by maximal @xmath68 oscillations ( the factor of 0.5 will play no role in the following discussions ) . using eq .",
    "( [ pex ] ) for antineutrinos , @xmath69 as long as @xmath70  m. and @xmath71 will be used to represent the antineutrino quantities , where @xmath52 are replaced by @xmath72 respectively . ] without any loss of generality , this will be considered as a constraint , since the case @xmath73 contradicts the karmen data @xcite and will not provide a realistic solution to the la .",
    "solving the la implies , therefore , that @xmath74  ev@xmath2/mev for lsnd - like energies @xmath75(3055 )  mev .",
    "this in turn implies , for solar neutrinos , @xmath76  ev@xmath2/mev ( remember the largest solar neutrino energy is three times smaller than the smallest lsnd energy ) , such that @xmath77",
    ". therefore , matter effects inside the sun will be very weak , and the best hope for solving the snp will be to obtain a very large effective mixing angle .",
    "this also explains why the adiabatic approximation works very well .    in order to obtain",
    "@xmath78 one can choose @xmath79 , such that there is an msw - like resonance at a typical solar neutrino energy @xmath80 between 010  mev .",
    "in more detail @xmath81^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the resonant solar neutrino energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the solar neutrino data requires , very generously , that , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "is constrained to be between 0.5 and 0.7 for the entire solar neutrino energy range .",
    "this provides a rather poor fit to the data , but is the best one can hope to achieve . ]",
    "this translates into @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out that the chooz bound @xcite on @xmath87 forbids such a choice .    at chooz , @xmath88  ev@xmath2/mev ( remember that typical reactor antineutrino energies are of the order of typical solar neutrinos energies ) , such that @xmath89 at the chooz experiment ( @xmath90  m ) . assuming that there is a resonance in the solar neutrino sector at some @xmath80 , @xmath91 and the bound @xmath92 from chooz translates into @xmath93 , in disagreement with the requirements from the the snp discussed above .",
    "next , consider @xmath94 but @xmath95 .",
    "as before , the la will constrain @xmath96 . in the case",
    "@xmath97 , the survival probability will be very similar to the case of no lorentz invariance violation ( @xmath98 ) , and is therefore uninteresting .",
    "the opposite hypothesis , @xmath99 for typical lsnd energies invites further investigation . in this case",
    ", the la implies @xmath100  ev@xmath2/mev . if @xmath99 also for typical solar neutrino energies , @xmath78 for solar neutrinos , which provides a reasonable solution to the snp .",
    "this possibility is , unfortunately , immediately killed by the chooz bound , since @xmath101 for typical reactor antineutrino energies .",
    "another possibility , which can be quickly discarded , is the case @xmath102 and @xmath103 very small for typical solar neutrino energies , such that @xmath104 . in this case",
    ", @xmath105 is large , such that the chooz bound would be grossly violated , namely , @xmath106 at chooz .",
    "finally , there is the possibility of evoking an `` antiresonance '' at chooz , namely @xmath107 for some reactor antineutrino energies @xmath108 . in this case , one may hope to obtain maximal effective mixing in the neutrino sector and solve the snp . in more detail @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "note that away from @xmath111 , the chooz bound still presents a limit for @xmath112 .",
    "for example , requiring @xmath113 for @xmath114 implies @xmath115 .    under these circumstances ,",
    "the solar effective angle is @xmath116 which , in the limit @xmath117 implies @xmath118 , in disagreement with the solar data .    it worthwhile to comment at this point",
    "that it should not come as a surprise that no remotely appropriate fit to all neutrino data can be obtained with either @xmath119 and @xmath32 , or @xmath119 and @xmath58 as free parameters : the fit is severely over constrained .",
    "it remains , however , to check whether the addition of a fourth free parameter can help significantly .",
    "there is some room for optimism , since nonzero @xmath32 and @xmath58 seem to play significantly different roles in the previous discussions .",
    "for example , one may envision a large @xmath58 which can take care of the chooz bound , combined with a small enough @xmath64 and a large enough @xmath5 to solve the la .",
    "the snp may be solved by appropriately choosing @xmath32 in order to enforce a large effective solar mixing angle , and so on .",
    "an optimal solution was numerically searched by performing a `` straw - man fit '' to the chooz , solar and lsnd data .",
    "explicitly , this was done by requiring that @xmath120 in ten 1  mev - wide solar neutrino energy bins ( from 0 to 10  mev ) , @xmath121 in seven 1  mev - wide reactor antineutrino energy ( from 2 to 9  mev ) bins at chooz , and @xmath122 in five 5  mev - wide antineutrino energy bins at lsnd ( from 30 to 55  mev ) .",
    "a more detailed fit is beyond the scope of this discussion , but it should be noted that the constraints imposed here are rather mild , such that a realistic fit will probably yield more severe constraints on a lorentz - invariant violating solution to both the snp and la .",
    "the oscillation probabilities obtained at the solar , reactor , and lsnd ( anti)neutrino energy ranges are depicted in fig .  [ fig : best ] , for one `` best fit point : '' @xmath123  ev@xmath2 , @xmath124 , @xmath125  ev@xmath2/mev , and @xmath126  ev@xmath2/mev . other points which also provide a reasonable fit are very similar , and characterized by @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130  ev@xmath2 .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first of all , the result obtained is not altogether inconsistent with the data .",
    "as a matter of fact , the result obtained is in good agreement with the reactor constraints , and the lsnd data .",
    "the karmen constraints are easily satisfied , given that @xmath131 at both lsnd and karmen , such that oscillation effects at the karmen site are suppressed with respect to effects at the lsnd experiment by @xmath132 .",
    "( remember that @xmath133 ) .",
    "the biggest concern rests in the solution to the snp .",
    "the fact that @xmath134 in the entire energy range ( the reason for this , namely the fact that @xmath135 has already been addressed in detail ) , implies that a good fit to the solar data can not be obtained .",
    "for example , the sno and superkamiokande data alone rule out this model at more than the two sigma level.b solar neutrino flux @xcite was off by a factor of 2 .",
    "] nonetheless , the energy dependency of @xmath136 obtained for the lorentz - invariant violating model considered here is not too different from that obtained for regular two - neutrino oscillations and @xmath137  ev@xmath2 .",
    "next , i address the atmospheric neutrino data . for atmospheric ( anti)neutrinos , which travel at least 10  km before reaching the , say , superkamiokande detector , @xmath138 assuming that the values of the four parameters @xmath139 provide a proper fit to the snp and the la .",
    "this means that @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath141 , @xmath142 . given the range of parameters delimited above , one obtains @xmath143 for all @xmath144 and all @xmath145 .",
    "such a possibility is certainly not a good fit to the atmospheric neutrino data , which clearly prefers @xmath146 . in order to be able to make a definitive statement , however , a full three neutrino analysis of the atmospheric data including the ether - potentials",
    "is required . nonetheless , there is a hint that the lorentz - invariant violating hypothesis discussed here is strongly disfavored if one considers the current constraint on @xmath147 from the anp @xcite",
    ". a realistic analysis may provide even stronger constraints , given that the value of @xmath148 above are energy independent , and should also modify the measured @xmath47-flux distributions significantly ( given that @xmath149 ) .    finally , the most stringent constraints come from old @xmath150 searches @xcite .",
    "similar to atmospheric neutrinos , the neutrinos in these experiments are high energy and the baseline is long , such that @xmath151 .",
    "the result of @xcite , namely @xmath152 , is in gross disagreement with the `` best fit '' expectations quoted above .    in summary , it is fair to say that the presence of ether - potentials ( as defined in the previous section ) can not accommodate the current neutrino data , at least when only the @xmath153-sector is affected ( @xmath46 is a linear combination of @xmath154 ) .",
    "while a good fit to the la and the reactor data can be obtained , only a marginal solution to the snp exists , and there are further constraints from the atmospheric data and older searches for @xmath155 oscillations . however , the fact that one can not fit all the data should not come as a surprise .",
    "the most important reason for this expectation is that the lorentz - invariant violating term serve as an effective potential , and not an effective mass .",
    "this implies that a ) the standard @xmath156 behavior of the survival probabilities will be severely modified , b ) the effective mixing angle will vary substantially with energy and c ) standard matter effects are altered .",
    "indeed , the fact that the snp and the la can be marginally reconciled without violating the chooz bound may come as a bigger surprise ( at least to me ) !",
    "an important question is whether a full three neutrino fit could be more successful .",
    "such a fit would contain eleven free parameters ( two mass - squared differences , three mixing angles , one complex dirac phase and five ether - potentials ) and is certainly beyond the scope of this discussion . while there are enough new free parameters ( which should render performing such a fit very challenging ) , it is worthwhile to comment that many features of the atmospheric data , such as the peculiar @xmath156 of the @xmath47 flux should prove to be a serious challenge to the oscillations in the presence of the lorentz - invariance violating operators considered here , indicating that such a fit will encounter challenges which are not too dissimilar from the ones faced here .",
    "i believe that obtaining a successful fit to all the data with a three - neutrino is rather improbable , but , perhaps , not impossible .",
    "cpt violation implies , necessarily , violation of lorentz invariance and/or locality . under certain circumstances ,",
    "cpt violation requires a reinterpretation of the quantum field theoretical formalism which is used to describe , extremely successfully , all short distance physics to date .",
    "it has been pointed out that if the neutrinos and antineutrinos had different masses ( cpt violation ) , all neutrino puzzles could be solved without the addition of extra light degrees of freedom to the standard model .",
    "this hypothesis seems to violate both lorentz invariance and locality , and renders a quantum field theoretical description of the neutrinos ( including loop - effects , time - evolution , etc ) rather cumbersome .    here",
    ", i have considered a formalism for cpt violation @xcite which can be treated self consistently within quantum field theory ( it look like `` standard '' effective field theory ) by adding a few effective lorentz invariant - violating operator ( ether - potentials ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that one can not obtain a set of parameters which will satisfy the solar neutrino data , the atmospheric neutrino data , the lsnd data , and the reactor data at the same time , at least within a two - flavor analysis .",
    "i tried to argued that , contrary to previous claims @xcite , one should at least suspect that the existence of ether - potentials is insufficient to accommodate all the neutrino data .",
    "the most interesting feature discussed here is , perhaps , the fact that a good fit can almost be obtained if both diagonal and , more importantly , off - diagonal ether - potentials are present .",
    "one of the big barriers one is forced to face is the fact that , for solar neutrinos , the electron neutrino survival probability is always greater than one half , in contradiction with the current solar neutrino data ( _ e.g. , _ superkamiokande and sno ) .",
    "if it turns out that the solar data definitively _ requires _",
    "@xmath157 ( at a very high confidence level ) for a finite energy range , the `` ether solution '' would be unambiguously ruled out .",
    "this may very well be achieve after the new sno results on the neutral current cross - section and the day - night effect are released .",
    "constraints on @xmath32 and @xmath58 ( as defined in the previous section ) are , of course , possible to obtain outside the realm of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the authors of @xcite already point out that , through loops , one can severely constraint @xmath158 .. ] since oscillation signatures only depend on @xmath159 , this strong bound is irrelevant if one allows @xmath160 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ether - potentials were to be written in @xmath161 invariant forms , very severe tree - level constraints from the charged lepton sector would probably render the model useless as far as neutrino oscillation phenomenology is concerned .",
    "constraints on the off - diagonal @xmath58 and on the second generation @xmath162 are expected to be much weaker , and the best constraints will come from the neutrino oscillations experiments themselves .",
    "for example , from the discussions in the previous section , the la already constraints @xmath163 .",
    "future neutrino experiments including kamland ( @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , borexino and long baseline neutrino experiments ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) can push the bounds on @xmath44 by many orders of magnitude . for example , if it turns out that strong solar matter effects are required to solve the snp , one would be force to constraint @xmath164  gev , while if borexino observes seasonal variations , their data will be consistent with @xmath165  gev @xcite , implying @xmath166  gev .",
    "it is important to note that other lorentz invariant violating effects which differ from the ones considered here also lead to modified neutrino oscillation probability .",
    "@xcite instead of the mass induced @xmath156 behavior or the @xmath145 behavior discussed here . ] for a constraints imposed on such terms by the atmospheric neutrino data see @xcite .",
    "the results presented here apply only to the scenario when only the ether - potentials are added to the standard model , and it is certainly not clear whether a complicated combination of several different effects will not lead to a better fit to the data .",
    "it does seem , in my opinion , unlikely .",
    "after the completion of this work , new data was presented by the sno collaboration .",
    "it strengthens significantly the statement that @xmath157 for @xmath167 neutrinos ( at more than the three sigma level ) and renders the possibility of obtaining a good fit with the ether - potentials attempted here virtually impossible , as hinted to in sec .",
    "the sma solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , which was ignored in the discussions contained here , is ruled out by the current solar data at around the five sigma level .",
