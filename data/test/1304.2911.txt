    "lateral organic spin valves ( osvs)@xcite hold the promise of integrating non - volatile switching into organic field effect transistors ( ofets ) . in contrast to vertical spin valves ,",
    "however , they are much more difficult to fabricate .",
    "while in vertical spin valves the thickness of the organic layer determines the spacing between the magnetic electrodes@xcite which can be as small as a few nanometers , lateral spin valves need highly sophisticated patterning to achieve a similarly small gap between the two contacts .",
    "this patterning usually involves electron - beam lithography based processing @xcite resulting in massive contamination of the contact surfaces and thus impeding spin valve operation .",
    "we have developed a novel fabrication process for lateral spin valves with channel lengths of less than @xmath0 and contamination free interfaces .",
    "two prerequisites are mandatory for an organic spin valve : firstly , two ferromagnetic electrodes must be prepared that have different coercive fields in order to allow for parallel or antiparallel magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "secondly , the spacing between the two electrodes which is filled with the organic semiconductor ( osc ) must be smaller than the spin diffusion length .",
    "any reports so far show that the gap should not exceed @xmath0 in order to allow for sizeable spin valve effects@xcite . in vertical spin valves these preconditions",
    "can easily be met by depositing a stack of two different ferromagnetic materials with an osc of suitable thickness in between .",
    "clean interfaces can be obtained by depositing the whole layer stack in a uhv chamber . for lateral devices",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "a lateral gap of less than @xmath0 is usually achieved by electron beam patterning of a ferromagnetic layer either using etching or evaporation and lift - off@xcite .",
    "the coercive fields of the contacts can be tuned in the same process step by making striped contacts of different widths in the sub - micron range@xcite .",
    "this patterning process , however , results in a massive contamination and typically oxidation of the surface of the ferromagnetic contacts before the osc is deposited .",
    "resistless patterning using a solid shadow mask without the need for a lift - off can circumvent this problem , however , the lateral resolution of mechanically fabricated masks does not reach down to the necessary @xmath0 range .",
    "in our process we are using a combination of optical lithography , lift - off , and shadow evaporation under different angles .",
    "this process yields uncontaminated interfaces , a small gap for the osc and contacts with a sizeable difference in coercive field ( flow chart shown fig . [ figfab]a - c ) .    in the first step a rectangular stripe of ni ( 0.75@xmath4 x 4.0@xmath4 )",
    "is patterned by optical lithography , evaporation , and lift - off on a silicon wafer covered by @xmath5 of silicon oxide ( fig .",
    "[ figfab]a ) . here ,",
    "vertical sidewalls of the ni are crucial for the subsequent steps . without any further treatment , the sample",
    "is then transferred into a uhv chamber ( base pressure @xmath6 ) in which first a thin layer of cofe is evaporated with the sample tilted by @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ figfab]b ) . the shadow of the ni contact results in a gap of less than @xmath0 which now separates two contact areas : one bilayer contact ( ni and cofe ) and a single layer contact ( cofe only ) .",
    "the nominal length of the separating gap @xmath8 is determined by the thickness of the ni layer @xmath9 as :    @xmath10    without breaking the uhv - conditions the gap is then filled by evaporation of the _ n_-type osc ptcdi - c4f7 ( @xmath1-bis(heptafluorobutyl)-@xmath2-perylene diimide , molecular structure shown in fig .",
    "[ figfab]f ) under a suitable angle ( fig .",
    "[ figfab]c ) .",
    "ptcdi - c4f7 is used due to its excellent properties with respect to stability in ambient conditions and electron mobility @xcite . according to @xcite the stability of ptcdi - c4f7 layers originates from their high packing density prohibiting oxygen and moisture diffusion .",
    "hence the osc layer in our devices also protects the underlying ferromagnetic electrodes from contamination after removal from the uhv - chamber .",
    "+ during the two in - situ evaporation steps a large area shadow mask with rectangular windows is used to achieve well separated and uniform devices ( fig .",
    "[ figfab]d and e ) without the need for any further lithography .",
    "typical dimensions of the devices are : channel width @xmath11 , thickness of the cofe contact @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a resulting @xmath14 . +",
    "fig . [ figesem ] shows a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) image of the gap of a sample device after the first tilted metal evaporation .",
    "au and ti were used instead of ni and cofe in order to enhance the contrast .",
    "obviously the nominal channel length of @xmath15 is not achieved , most likely due to diffusion and slightly tilted sidewalls .",
    "furthermore the channel length is not constant but is varying due to imperfections at the edge of the contact defined by optical lithography .",
    "the shape of the au edge is transferred also to the shape of the ti layer leading to small protrusions of different sizes .",
    "+ the magnetic properties of the devices are studied by magneto optical kerr rotation ( moke ) at room temperature ( fig .",
    "[ figmoke ] ) .",
    "measurements are performed on reference samples with layers of the following compositions : a single @xmath15 thick ni layer ( red curve , line with open squares ) , a bilayer ( @xmath16 cofe on top of @xmath15 ni , black curve , line with diamonds ) , and a @xmath16 cofe layer ( blue curve , line with open circles ) .",
    "the last two layers correspond to our two device contacts . due to the large penetration depth of the probe",
    "beam the moke signal is a superposition of the signals collected from cofe and ni , respectively .",
    "the measurements show that for the bilayer the two metals are ferromagnetically coupled and the ( thicker ) ni is dominating the switching ( @xmath17 ) , while a single cofe layer has a considerably higher coercive field ( @xmath18 )",
    ". therefore also the coercive fields of our devices contacts are different , one decisive prerequisite for true spin valve operation .",
    "electrical separation of the two contacts is checked by using them as drain and source of an ofet and the substrate as the gate electrode ( insert of fig . [ figgate]a ) .",
    "output characteristics @xmath19 at constant @xmath20 ( @xmath21 drain current , @xmath22 drain source voltage , @xmath20 gate source voltage ) in fig . [",
    "figgate]a show a clear dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath20 .",
    "however , neither saturation of @xmath21 nor the typical quadratic dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath20 can be observed at high @xmath22 . with a channel length much smaller than the oxide thickness",
    "the gradual channel approximation is no longer valid @xcite and the ofets are in the short channel regime . in a second control experiment ( fig .",
    "[ figgate]b ) the osc is removed after the i / v - characterization , leading to a channel current below the measurement limit , a clear indication that the only current path is through the osc .    as can be seen from the i / v and output characteristics in fig .",
    "[ figgate]b the devices exhibit large resistances in the range of a few @xmath24 to hundreds of @xmath24 at room temperature .",
    "the observed drain currents in the range of @xmath25 at low @xmath22 are in good agreement with unpublished studies of ptcdi - c4f7-based ofet structures with ferromagnetic metal electrodes which were patterned by optical lithography ( @xmath26 ) . because with decreasing temperature the current drops below the measurement limit , all magnetotransport studies are carried out at room temperature .",
    "[ figmr]a and b show the magnetoresistance ( mr ) traces of two different spin valve structures . for both devices",
    "we observe a hysteretic spin valve behavior with a negative magnetoresistance which is often observed in osv devices .",
    "shape and magnitude of the two curves differ , however , considerably and can not be explained by the simple reversal of two ferromagnets .",
    "device a has a baseline resistance of @xmath27 and shows two distinct switching events for each sweep direction .",
    "however , when increasing the magnetic field from negative saturation towards positive values the first magnetization reversal is observed before zero b - field is reached which is in contrast to normal spin valve behavior ( fig . [ figmr]c ) . in this device",
    "the magnetoresistance @xmath28 is @xmath29 ( absolute value ) .",
    "for device b the baseline resistance is @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetoresistance trace indicates a magnetization rotation rather than a switching .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the magnetoresistance is increased to @xmath3 . in device",
    "b the mr trace is also hysteretic , however , with a lateral shift reminiscent of exchange bias . with the ni electrode being exposed to air during the processing ,",
    "it is indeed likely that nio , which is an antiferromagnet with a nel temperature well above room temperature , leads to exchange bias in the electrode@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the characteristic magnetic fields in both mr traces are higher than would be expected from the moke characterization of the contact layers .    while exchange bias only is not sufficient to explain the shape of the mr traces it can be understood if the possible transport mechanism is reconsidered based on findings of @xcite .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the fabrication of a nanometer - sized pin - hole like artificial tmr contact through an osc using conducting atomic force microscopy .",
    "the baseline resistance that they observe is in a similar regime as the one seen in our experiments .",
    "also the magnetoresistance traces are more complex than typical for osv structures .",
    "we suspect that in our devices the conductance channel is a very small lateral tunneling contact created by a small protrusion on one of the two ferromagnetic contacts ( fig .",
    "[ figmr]d ) .",
    "the resistances of our contacts are in the regime observed by barraud et al . , while the variations from device to device are large corresponding to statistical size variations of accidental protrusions .",
    "large area current injection over the whole contact edge , however , would result in a resistance proportional to the gap size , and variations from device to device should be small .",
    "this concept is also helpful to understand the shape of the magnetoresistance traces which is now largely dominated by the local domain structure of the small tip . in addition , the tip is in direct vicinity of the opposing ( @xmath31-sized ) contact which is less than @xmath32 away . because the magnetic field is applied along the stripes ( crossing the gap in the direction from one contact to the other ) the stray field is extremely large .",
    "hence we expect to observe a strong dipolar coupling between the tip and the opposing contact resulting in switching fields different from those observed by moke .",
    "we have demonstrated that a simple shadow evaporation process can be used for the fabrication of lateral osvs with clean interfaces and different switching fields of the ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "the devices show a large magnetoresistance in the range of a few @xmath33 up to @xmath3 at room temperature .",
    "the observed effect can be explained as a spin valve signal in a lateral tunnel junction where one of the electrodes is a small , randomly shaped protrusion on a ferromagnetic contact .",
