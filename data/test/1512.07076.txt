    "observations of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) undoubtedly portrayed a late - time speeding up universe @xcite , dominated by some sort of exotic fluid , different from matter and responsible for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "this component , dubbed dark energy , exhibits a anti - gravitational negative equation of state ( eos ) @xcite . enclosing the corresponding dark energy density within einstein s energy momentum tensor means to counterbalance the gravitational attraction , reproducing cosmological observations .",
    "several explanations have been carried out in the literature in order to motivate dark energy s existence , albeit a complete and self consistent physical interpretation is so far unknown @xcite .",
    "the simplest approach leads to introducing a cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath0 , associated to quantum field vacuum energy . the corresponding paradigm",
    ", namely the @xmath0cdm model @xcite excellently fits cosmological data , providing @xmath0 to be the most promising dark energy explanation .",
    "notwithstanding its experimental successes , the @xmath0cdm model suffers from a profound _ fine - tuning problem _ @xcite .",
    "particularly , quantum field predictions suggests @xmath0 to differ from 120 orders of magnitude from cosmological measurements .",
    "in addition , comparable magnitudes between matter and @xmath0 densities have been experimentally found , leading to a serious _ coincidence problem _ @xcite .",
    "this coincidence may be healed if one supposes an evolving dark energy eos , whereas fine - tuning is avoided if one does not assume @xmath0 s existence . for those reasons , a _ plethora _ of alternative approaches",
    "have been proposed throughout the years , spanning from modifications of the hilbert - einstein action @xcite , additional scalar or tachyonic fields @xcite , k - essence approach @xcite , to parameterizations of the barotropic factor , phenomenological pressures , varying cosmological constant @xcite , holographic principle @xcite and so forth @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all dark energy models are plagued from the problem of separately measuring present - time matter density and total eos , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . rephrasing it , measurements of @xmath3 are _ intertwined _ with allowed values of @xmath4 or with curvatures in models with no definite ansatz on the friedmann flow @xcite .",
    "thus , all energy densities enter the hubble flow indistinguishably and so , a strong degeneracy occurs if one simultaneously measures different cosmological fluids @xcite .",
    "this causes that different models are capable of fitting data with high accuracy , whereby it is impossible to univocally determine the dark energy physical nature .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for vanishing spatial curvature , a homogeneous and isotropic universe is described by one function only , i.e. the scale factor @xmath5 , accounting the _ total _ universe energy budget .",
    "a _ dark degeneracy _ problem arises , representing a disturbing conundrum to establish properties of dark energy .",
    "the strategy of separate measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath4 suffers from an interdependence that does not allow to draw distinct information on both matter and dark energy .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is postulated to satisfy geometric prescriptions , related to bianchi identities and , in the coarse - grained case of perfect fluids , it reads @xmath6 . as a technical consequence ,",
    "friedmann equations account for the pressure and densities of all components involving in the universe description .",
    "hence , we only measure the total energy density , instead of single components .",
    "the total eos is simply defined as @xmath7 , sometimes referred to as the _ barotropic factor _ if @xmath8 does not depend explicitly on the entropy .    in this paper , we first propose a cosmographic method for alleviating the dark degeneracy .",
    "second , we present a _ cosmographic dark energy model _ , which permits one to parameterize separately matter from dark energy in a scheme that depends only on cosmokinematic measurable quantities .",
    "our technique allows to fix robust constraints on observables , regardless of any priors imposed from the beginning on @xmath3 .",
    "we only need the cosmological principle to circumvent degeneracy by means of a fully kinematic dark energy reconstruction .",
    "the method is well supported by cosmographic demands , which represent a way to bound cosmological constraints involving the scale factor derivatives only , in a model independent framework @xcite .",
    "in fact , since scale factor derivatives can be accurately measured up to a certain order , cosmography fixes in turn @xmath4 and @xmath3 employing only two cosmographic coefficients : the universe acceleration , @xmath9 , and the variation of acceleration , @xmath10 .",
    "further , the assumption of a completely general expression for the hubble rate @xmath11 without considering any prescription on its dynamical behavior can be naturally derived . as a result",
    ", it is possible to reduce the number of degrees of freedom related to the degeneracy problem .",
    "in particular , since degeneracy arises as a byproduct of the standard lore dependence on a single function , our model is built up by means of cosmographic parameters only , without any conjecture on the dark energy evolution . in the last part of our work , in fact",
    ", we compare our approaches with cosmological data , getting limits over the cosmographic free parameters which are model - independent quantities .",
    "thus , these procedures may alleviate the dark degeneracy and suggest a way to _ disentangle _ the measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath3 . a high - impact application of our treatment deals with determining whether dark energy evolves or not in time . in our framework , we get a possible dark energy evolution which would be different from a pure cosmological constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is dedicated to resume the cosmic degeneracy and to discussion on the basic requirements of cosmography .",
    "section iii is devoted to explain how to alleviate the degeneracy problem by means of cosmography . in the same section",
    ", we propose the definition of our cosmographic model .",
    "section iv deals with data fitting procedures performed to deduce experimental constraints .",
    "section v finally regards comments and conclusions with particular attention to the perspectives of our approach .",
    "here , we present how cosmography can alleviate the cosmic degeneracy between the total eos and matter density . to do so , we need to enter the technical aspects of the degeneracy issue , showing the strategy to relate it to cosmography .",
    "first , we circumscribe our analysis to a spatially flat universe ( @xmath12 ) , employing the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , i.e. @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the friedmann equations read : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter .",
    "any cosmological model is univocally characterized once @xmath18 is determined .",
    "unfortunately , feasible bounds on the _ total _ eos are unable to experimentally split the barotropic factor into components . saying it differently , since @xmath19 , with the subscript @xmath20 indicating each cosmic species",
    ", it seems difficult to impose limits either on @xmath21 or @xmath22 by considering numerical bounds on @xmath8 only .",
    "generally , at present time , there is a common arbitrariness in splitting @xmath8 into ( at least ) two species : the first is clearly due to dark energy , whereas the other one to the universe total matter .",
    "any further contributions , e.g. neutrinos , photons , string relics , etc . do not significantly contribute to the whole energy budget at @xmath23 and may be neglected . combining between them the friedmann equations and introducing the density parameter @xmath24 for matter ,",
    "one obtains a general expression for the eos of dark energy @xcite : @xmath25 equation suggests that , given a range of intervals for @xmath3 , the term @xmath8 spans a corresponding tight interval of allowed values . even tracing the universe expansion history",
    "does not enable to separate both those intervals , therefore it is hard to discriminate the best one among different cosmological models @xcite . in other words ,",
    "several cosmological paradigms constitute equivalent classes of models capable of describing the universe dynamics at late - times .",
    "we want to show here that , through the use of cosmography , one can _ circumvent _ the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath8 separately , without fixing the cosmological model _ a priori _ @xcite .",
    "to do so , let us introduce the basic requirements of cosmography",
    ". in particular , cosmography represents a branch of cosmology , which only involves the use of easygoing symmetry assumptions , concerning the validity of the cosmological principle .",
    "a feasible consequence of this prescription is expanding the scale factor @xmath5 into power series around @xmath26 .",
    "so that , we obtain    @xmath27    with @xmath28 . the strategy behind the above expansion provides the relevant property of cosmography of being model independent in choosing bounds on derivatives of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "to better understand this fact , the scale factor derivatives may be set as follows @xmath29 which have been also expressed in terms of the measurable quantity @xmath30 .",
    "these quantities are known in the literature as the acceleration parameter , @xmath31 , quantifying whether the universe accelerates or decelerates , and the jerk parameter , @xmath32 , showing whether the universe changes its acceleration sign after the transition time @xcite . in our picture , the subscript @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( @xmath34 ) underlines that @xmath35 and @xmath32 are presently fixed , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "hence , one argues cosmography can fix important constraints on our present universe .",
    "the reasons which permit to conclude that cosmography does not depend on the choice of any cosmological model are listed as follows @xcite .",
    "* scalar curvature is somehow fixed to be zero .",
    "precise observations at late and early - times confirm this property , showing that the universe is spatially flat .",
    "the measurement of the jerk parameter depends on the spatial curvature @xmath37 , but if @xmath37 vanishes , the jerk parameter is purely model - independently determined . *",
    "all observable quantities can be expressed in terms of the scale factor or alternatively by means of the redshift @xmath38 , through the formula @xmath39 .",
    "this fact is a technical advantage of cosmography , since different data sets well adapt to cosmographic analyses .",
    "further , we commonly refer to the _ cosmographic series _ ( cs ) as the set of numerical constraints on @xmath35 and @xmath32 evaluated today .",
    "the need of precise bounds on cs becomes essential to extrapolate information on the universe dynamics .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that taylor expansions are plagued by a severe convergence problem , since expansions are based on assuming that @xmath40 , whereas cosmological data typically exceed this range .",
    "hence , without deeply entering this argument , to reduce any systematics in the fitting procedures , we develop all series expansions up to a suitable order ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "for those reasons , we only consider the first three cosmographic terms in eq .",
    "( [ serie1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath41 , since they are more efficiently constrained by observational data .",
    "we now consider a sort of  back scattering \" procedure , to fix the free parameters of a dark energy model , without the need of finding out constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to build up our model ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath3 and @xmath4 in terms of cosmographic quantities .",
    "we therefore obtain a sort of  fully \" cosmographic hubble flow @xcite which is not plagued by the initial bias due to the particular choice of dark energy density . the procedure to obtain a fully cosmographic dark energy model consists in possible parameterizations of the eos of dark energy through the use of the cs",
    ". this treatment substitutes the measurement of @xmath3 with the observable value of @xmath31 and @xmath32 at present time . as we will clarify in the next section ,",
    "since @xmath42 and @xmath43 may be bounded independently , by simply comparing the expanded luminosity distance directly with data , one may get a hubble rate parametrization in which the matter contribute is replaced by cosmographic quantities .",
    "we also quantitatively demonstrate that this method does not shift the degeneracy from matter and @xmath8 to the cs , but allows to fix limits on a new set of cosmographic variables which are bounded directly with data .",
    "in this section , we focus on how to build up our _ cosmographic model_. the only basic requirement consists in splitting the matter fluid from the dark energy term in the hubble rate , saying that : @xmath44 in eq . ( [ hz ] ) , the dark energy density @xmath45 is unknown and it is supposed to vary in terms of the redshift @xmath38 through a non specified function @xmath46 , built up by the following properties :    @xmath47    the first condition , reported in the above list , leads to @xmath48 as @xmath36 . the second condition is a direct consequence of the first condition , while the third condition requires that dark energy dominates over matter at late - times .",
    "those three properties derive from the splitting of the net energy - momentum tensor and are compatible with the standard cosmological requirements .",
    "let us consider eq .",
    "( @xmath49 ) and the definitions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in terms of @xmath30 , given by eqs .",
    "( @xmath50 ) . merging these two relations , one obtains    @xmath51}{2\\left[\\omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{3}+\\omega_{de}g(z)\\right]}\\,,\\ ] ]    and @xmath52\\right\\}}{2\\left[\\omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{3}+\\omega_{de}g(z)\\right]}\\,,\\ ] ]    which describe the cosmographic parameters in terms of matter and dark energy contents of the universe . here",
    ", apices @xmath53 represent derivatives with respect to the redshift @xmath38 . in practice",
    ", cosmography gives the possibility to replace the mass density through the values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 exploiting eqs .",
    "( [ qudef ] ) and ( [ jeidef ] ) .",
    "our second step is to expand @xmath31 and @xmath32 , around @xmath54 :    @xmath55    which clearly reduce to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as @xmath54 . for our purposes",
    ", it behooves us to truncate the above series at the second order in @xmath58 .",
    "we therefore get :    @xmath59    it is easy to notice that the signs of @xmath60 are not directly fixed from the expansion",
    ". however , from theoretical arguments we can find out allowed intervals for those terms .",
    "for example , if we assume that the above expansions are valid at different stages of the universe evolution , we conclude that @xmath9 reduces to @xmath61 for @xmath62 . on the other side , to account for the dark energy effects at late times , one expects @xmath63 , while @xmath43 is expected to be positive in order to guarantee that @xmath31 could change its sign in time @xcite . to preserve this behavior ,",
    "it is strictly necessary to assume that @xmath64 thus we will adopt this assumption in the following .",
    "thence , by using eq .",

    "analogously , even the effective barotropic factor @xmath72 becomes mass - independent , as it will be clarified later in the text .    in principle , our approach is a three - parameter model .",
    "however , combining eqs .",

    "in fact , in eq .",
    "( [ stp ] ) , no information on the form of @xmath11 have been introduced before expanding to get eq .",
    "( [ lumdis1 ] ) . clearly , observational measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath42 constrain the corresponding cosmographic parameters @xmath83 .",

    "( [ relazione1 ] ) , we can note that @xmath77 is univocally determined if one knows @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for example by fitting eq .",

    "this is due to the fact that employing @xmath106 as free parameters our treatment becomes more complicated and the corresponding equations to get @xmath46 are not exactly solvable .    to determine cosmographic limits , we employ the use of the union 2.1 sneia compilation .",
    "we aim to perform two separate fits , in which we first fit the luminosity distance expanded around @xmath36 and we directly fit the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath78 , whereas afterwards we fit @xmath78 taking @xmath77 fixed through the best fit of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "pure _ cosmographic coefficients @xmath98 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . as a consequence , @xmath77",
    "is determined through the formula @xmath147 , letting @xmath78 to freely vary as the unique unbounded parameter . by virtue of the taylor treatments",
    ", the degeneracy between cosmographic coefficients less influences the whole analysis , contrary to the degeneracy between matter and dark energy densities which is jeopardized by the circularity problem when evaluating the luminosity distance .",
    "we also showed that to completely remove the degeneracy on the cosmographic couple of coefficients @xmath105 , it is possible to compute @xmath77 in function of @xmath93 , i.e. the first derivative with respect to the redshift of the universe eos .",
    "we considered two cosmological fits with the union 2.1 compilation by means of monte carlo analyses , performed by the free available codes bat and root . in the first fit",
    "all the cosmographic coefficients were free to vary , while in the second only @xmath78 evolves .",
    "we found that the concordance model is confirmed within the 1@xmath148 confidence level , although a slight evidence for an evolving dark energy contribution is not excluded by the analyses themselves .",
    "the numerical outcomes coming from the fits point out no conclusive indications for distinguishing the two cases .",
    "however , the strategy of splitting the measurement between @xmath3 and @xmath8 is a robust hint on how to handle the dark energy contribution .",
    "in particular , we found that the cosmographic terms @xmath98 and @xmath42 are compatible with the standard cosmological model , the term @xmath78 is slightly smaller than the one predicted by the concordance model and @xmath77 provides a different sign . in addition , we got @xmath124 which differs from the @xmath0cdm case , confirming that the dark energy contribution would reduce to a constant only at @xmath2 , but evolving elsewhere . to this end",
    ", additional analyses will clearly reduce the error propagations by combining different data sets , in order to discriminate whether the model effectively provides an evolving dark energy term . in doing so",
    ", we expect to improve the accuracy in facing the degeneracy problem , showing how dark energy effectively changes in time or not .",
    "future works , handling higher redshift terms in the taylor expansions , may represent a key towards a more accurate cosmographic dark energy model , especially for what concerns its evolution at higher redshift domains .",

    "<S> in this work we use cosmography to alleviate the degeneracy among cosmological models , proposing a way to parameterize matter and dark energy in terms of cosmokinematics quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the recipe of using cosmography allows to expand observable quantities in taylor series and to directly compare those expansions with data . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt this strategy and we propose a fully self - consistent parametrization of the total energy density driving the late time universe speed up . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , we describe a feasible _ cosmographic dark energy model _ , in which matter is fixed whereas dark energy evolves by means of the cosmographic series . </S>",
    "<S> our technique provides robust constraints on cosmokinematic parameters , permitting one to separately bound matter from dark energy densities . </S>",
    "<S> our cosmographic dark energy model turns out to be one parameter only , but differently from the @xmath0cdm paradigm , it does not contain ansatz on the dark energy form . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we even determine the free parameter of our model in suitable @xmath1 intervals through monte carlo analyses based on the metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the standard concordance model and we find that our treatment seems to indicate that dark energy slightly evolves in time , reducing to a pure cosmological constant only as @xmath2 . </S>"
