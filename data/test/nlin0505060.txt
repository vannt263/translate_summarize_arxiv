    "this method will be used in the present paper for a spherical system .",
    "the semiclassical theory , often referred to as periodic orbit theory ( pot ) , has been very successful not only in ( partial ) quantisation of a given hamiltonian , but also in interpreting many experimentally observable quantum oscillations in finite fermion systems  so - called `` shell effects ''  in terms of classical mechanics .",

    "an overview over many aspects of the pot and illustrative applications are given in @xcite .",

    "we describe some of the mathematical details of the semiclassical perturbation theory for the symmetry breaking u(3 ) @xmath25 so(3 ) and develop a uniform trace formula valid for arbitrary strengths @xmath1 in the hamiltonian . in section [ secpert ] we present the perturbative trace formula for the density of states which is valid in the limit of small @xmath1 and has been presented shortly in @xcite . it already puts the dominance of the shortest periodic orbits , namely the circles and diameters , into evidence .",
    "although their individual contributions to the perturbative trace formula diverge in the limit @xmath26 , their sum restores to the unperturbed ho trace formula with u(3 ) symmetry in this limit , which at the same time is the limit of zero energy .",

    "in particular , in this limit the system acquires the `` scaling property '' that its classical dynamics becomes independent of the energy which can be absorbed by a rescaling of coordinates and time .",
    "this limit will be discussed separately in section [ secquart ] .",
    "one interesting classical aspect is that no bifurcations of the circle orbits occur .",
    "the same rational tori , which bifurcate from the circle orbit in the perturbed ho system , exist here at all energies .",

    "we first write down the exact density of states of the unperturbed three - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , given by the hamiltonian h_0(r , p ) = 12 p^2 + 12 ^ 2 r^2 .",

    "@xmath40 is a small action that , quite generally , depends on @xmath1 and the energy @xmath18 .",
    "the factor in front of the sum in takes into account only the leading term of the smooth part @xmath34 ; this is consistent with the fact that the perturbation theory only deals with the terms of leading order in @xmath41 of the semiclassical trace formula . as we will see in section [ secqm ] ,",
    "the contributions of terms of relative order @xmath42 in @xmath34 are , indeed , negligible .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , one obtains @xmath39 from an integration of a perturbative phase function over the manifold that describes the classical degeneracy of the ho orbits . the unperturbed",
    "ho has u(3 ) symmetry , so that @xmath39 is formally obtained by the average ( k/ ) = e^iks(o)/_ou(3 ) , [ mav ] where @xmath43 is an element of the group u(3 ) characterising a member of the unperturbed ho orbit family , and @xmath44 is the lowest - order primitive action shift brought about by the perturbation @xmath45 in . in the present case",
    "@xmath44 is nonzero already in first - order perturbation theory and therefore @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath1 .",

    "this can most easily be seen by the following argument which also will allow us to find a suitable parametrisation for the four - fold integration .",

    "next we have to determine the action shift @xmath52 of a primitive periodic orbit of the ho , caused by the perturbation @xmath53 .",
    "the harmonic solutions of the classical equations of motion of the unperturbed system are well known : x_i = ( t+_i ) , i=1,2,3 ( x_1,x_2,x_3)=(x , y , z ) .",

    "[ secpois ] .",
    "the form of the modulation factor suggests a simple physical interpretation : the resulting two terms correspond to two separate families of orbits that survive the breaking of the u(3 ) symmetry .",
    "as we will see below , these are the circle and the diameter orbits with maximal and minimal ( i.e. , zero ) angular momentum , respectively , at fixed energy . for @xmath76",
    "these are actually the shortest periodic orbits found in the perturbed system .",
    "in contrast to the four - fold degenerate unperturbed ho orbits , they only have a two - fold degeneracy , since only rotations about two of the euler angles change their orientation .",
    "in general , the most degenerate periodic orbits in a three - dimensional system with spherical symmetry so(3 ) can be rotated about three euler angles . however , for each of the circle and diameter orbits one of the three rotations is redundant in the sense that it maps these orbits onto themselves : for the circles , it is the in - plane rotation around their centre , and for the diameters , it is the rotation about their own axis of motion .",
    "the loss of two degrees of degeneracy of these two orbit types with respect to the unperturbed ho orbits appears in the form of the factor @xmath77 in their amplitudes in , in agreement with the general counting of the powers of @xmath77 in semiclassical amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we will see in the next section that for values @xmath78 and large enough values of @xmath1 , there exist fully three - fold degenerate orbits , namely orbits with rational ratios @xmath79 of radial and angular frequencies with @xmath80 .",
    "they are created at bifurcations of the @xmath36-the repetitions of the circle orbits with @xmath81 .",

[ sorbits ] these values will be confirmed from the general expressions derived in the next section .",
    "the perturbative trace formula uniformly restores the oscillating part of the exact ho trace formula in the limit @xmath26 . in section [ secqm ]",
    "we will test its range of validity comparing against quantum - mechanical results .",
    "note that  as is usual in perturbation theory ",
    "the semiclassical amplitudes and actions of the orbits contributing to are correct only in the small-@xmath1 limit . in general",
    ", one has to generalise the perturbative trace formula to a uniform version that , in the limit of large perturbation , goes over into the corresponding ( extended ) gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "this uniformisation has been done for the breaking of u(1 ) symmetry in @xcite , and for some cases of u(2 ) symmetry breaking in @xcite ; one of the latter result applies , with suitable changes , also to some cases of so(3 ) @xmath25 u(1 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "the symmetry breaking u(3 ) @xmath25 so(3 ) under study here has not been treated in the literature so far .",
    "however , the simplicity of our above results makes the uniformisation particularly easy in the present case : since the modulation factor already has its own asymptotic form  or , inversely speaking : since the asymptotic expansion of the integral in in the limit of large @xmath46 happens to be exact also for @xmath84  it will be sufficient to replace in the perturbed actions @xmath82 , @xmath83 and their semiclassical amplitudes by those valid for all values of @xmath1 , which will be derived in the next section .",
