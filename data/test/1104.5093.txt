    "geomagnetism is still one of the unsolved fundamental problems of the earth since william gilbert discovered the magnetized earth ( gilbert 1600 ) .",
    "not only the very existence of the dipole magnetism , motonori matsuyama discovered the polarity reversal events ( matsuyama 1927 ) and vivid dynamics of geomagnetism .",
    "the qualitative nature of this polarity flip was explained by a simple disk model by tsuneji rikitake ( rikitake 1957 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) for geomagnetism ( roberts & glatzmaier 2000 ) , ( kono & roberts 2002 ) seem to describe such dynamics .",
    "inspired by these simulations , we recently studied to clarify the physics behind this remarkable polarity reversals proposing a simple model ( domino model ) ( mori , schmitt , ferriz - mas et al .",
    "2011 ) composed from many macro - spins which are interacting with each other .",
    "this _ coupled spin model _ is based on the idea that the whole dynamo mechanism is described by global interactions of many small dynamo elements ( macro - spins ) .",
    "this model naturally yields many of the observed features of geomagnetism : its time evolution , the power spectrum , the frequency distribution of stable polarity periods , etc .",
    "( mori et al . 2011 ) . in the case of the earth , the dynamo element , that a macro - spin describes ,",
    "is considered to be the taylor cell in the iron fluid core produced and supported by the coriolis force .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to develop the above idea by elaborating the domino model in a form that is _ minimal and general_.    in order to construct the _ minimal _ model , we introduce a _ long - range coupling _ of macro - spins , i.e. all the spins interact with each other with the same amplitude of interactions .",
    "this is essentially different from the previous domino model in which only neighboring spins interact with each other .",
    "it turns out that this long - range coupling model is also effective to describe the observed features of geomagnetism as the domino model .    in order to show the _ generality _ of the model , we consider it in wider contexts .",
    "the spin model , so far , is at most a phenomenological model to describe geomagnetism .",
    "therefore it needs some _ supplement from the basic mhd equations _ for better descriptions . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic fields associated with celestial objects are quite common in the universe ; many planets , satellites , and the stars including our sun .",
    "although the magnetic fields of these objects have variety that is quite different from the geomagnetism , all the magnetic fields are thought to be generated and supported by the robust dynamo mechanism .",
    "therefore we try to fit our model , supplemented with mhd equations , in _ other celestial objects _ and see how they are consistent with each other .",
    "the long - range coupled spin model can also describe the _ synchronization _ physics as well if we simply change the parameter value in the model .",
    "this property is particularly useful to describe the quasi - periodic variation of solar magnetic field .",
    "furthermore the long - range coupling in our model itself can produce sufficient chaoticity and randomness without introducing explicit random force as in the domino model .",
    "thus the long - range coupling spin model has rich physics and generality .",
    "we start our study by the basic description for geomagnetism .",
    "the _ fluid iron _ in the center of the earth is now considered to be the place where geomagnetism is created ( inglis 1981 ) . the conductive fluid motion and its interaction with electromagnetic fields should control the dynamics of geomagnetism through dynamo mechanism .",
    "they are described by the _ magneto - hydrodynamics _ ( mhd )  for incompressible ( @xmath0 ) fluid , @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4with appropriate boundary conditions ( roberts & glatzmaier 2000 ) .",
    "the dynamics of fluid velocity @xmath5  in eq.([eqforv ] ) is governed by the nonlinearity @xmath6 the pressure @xmath7 the centrifugal force potential @xmath8 , gravity @xmath9 , and the lorentz force @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electromagnetic current and @xmath12 is the mass density .",
    "the coriolis force @xmath13 yields the vorticity and convective pattern of the fluid .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath14 is amplified or reduced by the flow @xmath15 as described by eq.([eqforb ] ) .",
    "the dissipations ( @xmath16 ) and the energy injections ( from the heat generation @xmath17 and possibly the rotational driving force )  should balance with each other in the stationary state .",
    "main non - dimensional quantities which characterize the above set of equations , and their typical values in the iron fluid core in the earth , are as follows:@xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21these values are important to estimate the scale of dynamo elements in later sections .",
    "straightforward approach based on these highly complicated equations requires sophisticated numerical calculations .",
    "such analysis have recently been developed and the generation , maintenance and even reversals of geomagnetism have been obtained ( kida & kitauchi 1998),(roberts & glatzmaier 2000),(kono & roberts 2002 ) . these works have provided us with valuable knowledge to develop fundamental understanding of geomagnetism .",
    "however the parameter range in numerical calculations is still far from the above realistic values",
    ". therefore it would be very favorable if our coupled spin model is complementary to the mhd calculations and if it describes some basic features of dynamo mechanism .",
    "these are the aim of this paper .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in _ section 2 _",
    ", we describe our idea of the coupled dynamo elements which plays the central role in the present paper .",
    "we emphasize the necessary condition for the elements in order to clarify what the macro - spin represents in our model . readers who immediately want to see",
    "the model can skip this section . in _ section 3 _",
    ", we briefly review our previous study on the domino model ( short - range coupled spin model ( scs ) ) , which is a first realization of the idea of the coupled dynamo elements to describe geomagnetism . in _ section 4 _ , we introduce the generalized long - range coupled - spin model ( lcs ) in which macro - spins have long range interactions",
    ". then we apply this model to geomagnetism and successfully describe many of the characteristic features of geomagnetism . in _ section 5 _",
    ", we study the physical relevance of lcs model showing the similarity of it to the mean field model ( hmf ) and kuramoto model .",
    "readers who immediately want to see further applications of the model can skip this section . in _",
    "section 6 _ , we apply our model , supplemented with mhd equations , to other planets and satellites in order to estimate the scale of macro - spins . in _ section 7 _",
    ", we apply the same model , with different parameter values , to the solar magnetism and successfully describe the quasi - periodic dynamics of the solar magnetism .",
    "the last _ section 8 _ is devoted to summarize our work , and speculate possible generalizations of our idea of coupled dynamo elements .",
    "we now describe the idea of coupled dynamo elements ( mori et al .",
    "2011 ) which plays the fundamental role in this paper .",
    "the central equation to describe the dynamo mechanism in mhd is eq.([eqforb ] ) , in which the flow @xmath22  is determined by eq.([eqforv ] ) .",
    "this is practically a very complicated set of equations to describe geomagnetism and the dynamo mechanism though we can extract some basic insight from it .",
    "geomagnetism is characterized by the coexistence of many time scales , from million years to thousand years , with clear power - law power spectrum .",
    "the dynamo mechanism is ubiquitous in the sense that most of the celestial objects have magnetism generated from this mechanism .",
    "the ubiquitousness implies the basic dynamo mechanism is simple and the many time scales with power - law power spectrum imply the dynamo system is composed from many components .",
    "therefore we expect that _ the whole dynamo system may be composed of many elements , each of which has minimal dynamo function , that interact with other elements in a simple form_. it is often happen that a simple interaction yields very complicated structures .",
    "then what is the element which has the minimal dynamo function in the case for geomagnetism ?",
    "we notice that the above eq.([eqforb ] ) is similar to the general equation for vorticity @xmath23 @xmath24which is derived by taking the rotation of eq.([eqforv ] ) , neglecting the lorentz force term .",
    "this fact reveals the apparent duality of the magnetic field @xmath14 and the vorticity @xmath25 .",
    "the iron fluid core is estimated to be highly turbulent from eq.([re ] ) and is full of vorticities .",
    "the coherent vorticity @xmath25  is generated from the convection and coriolis force .",
    "these effects seem to be significant from the values in eqs.([ta]-[ra ] ) .",
    "therefore the iron fluid is full of vorticity , and possibly of magnetic fields .",
    "it is clear that the coriolis force dominates in the iron fluid as in eq.([ta ] ) . in general ,",
    "if the coriolis force dominates in almost the stationary flow , then eq.([eqforv ] ) becomes @xmath26 by taking the rotation of this form , we have @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the flow has a tendency to be two - dimensional perpendicular to the rotational axes @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ the taylor - proudman theorem",
    ". therefore this theorem suggests that a convection of iron fluid forms convective columns ( usually called taylor cell ) parallel to the rotation axes .",
    "the scale of the taylor cell will be determined by geometry and various parameters in eqs.([re]-[ra ] ) .",
    "thus coherent vorticity @xmath29  is naturally expected in the earth core .",
    "however the vorticity @xmath25  is not sufficient to produce magnetism @xmath14 ( tsinober 2007 ) .",
    "this is because the circular vorticity itself is not endowed with energy production .",
    "any deviation from the complete circular motion would be necessary for the production of magnetic energy .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the inward - winding vorticity is essential for dynamo mechanism .",
    "suppose that we prepare a typical inward - winding solution for the navier - stokes equation , the burgers vortex , whose velocity field is expressed in the cylindrical coordinate @xmath30 as    @xmath31    with some constants @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for inward - winding and @xmath34 for outward - winding . then putting the above eq.([bergers ] ) into eq.([eqforb ] ) yields , in the cartesian coordinate ,    @xmath35    for the magnetic field @xmath36 parallel to the symmetry axes of the vorticity . only the first term in rhs can definitely enhance @xmath37 if @xmath38 the inward - winding flow squeezes the magnetic force lines against the positive pressure from @xmath37 .",
    "summarizing all the above , the iron fluid in the earth core may allow _ multiple vortex columns parallel to the earth rotation axes and their interaction may cooperatively yield the whole geomagnetism , if the columns are inward - winding_.    on the other hand in the super computer simulations , such column structure is commonly formed ( kida & kitauchi 1998 ) and robustly persists .",
    "these columns are called taylor cell(tc ) . a close look into tc in the numerical data , reveals that tc are either inward - winding ( _ i.e. _ high - pressure due to the compression ) or outward - winding ( _ i.e. _ low - pressure due to the spread ) .",
    "they are called , respectively , anti - cyclone and cyclone .",
    "that is the anti - cyclone counter rotates to the earth and the cyclone co - rotates .",
    "the coriolis force associated with the earth rotation makes these difference and the smooth flow may favor the alternating configuration of cyclone and anti - cyclone .",
    "according to the above argument , only the anti - cyclone , which has inward - winding flow , can produce magnetic fields ( kageyama & sato 1997 ) . in the real situations in the earth ,",
    "the flow is highly turbulent and non - linear on top of such tc structures reflecting the large reynolds number eq.([re ] ) .",
    "complicated magnetic fields in the outer core are captured by inward - winding tc and aligned with the rotation axes , and then compressed to enhance the poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "these non - linear flow , as well as huge electric current , yields the interaction among tc , either short - range or long - range .",
    "each dynamo element of inward - winding vorticity , anti - cyclone , accompanies generated magnetic fields which can be characterized by a direction and a strength in the first approximation .",
    "therefore we characterize each dynamo element as a _ vector _ quantity @xmath39 .",
    "this vector represents the direction of the magnetic fields associated with tc and not the direction of tc itself .",
    "since each element is supposed to have the minimum dynamo function , this vector can be identified as a macroscopic spin or magnetic moment .",
    "then the whole system should be a set of such macro - spins @xmath40 , which is located on each site @xmath41 in the iron fluid core .",
    "although the interactions between the macro - spins should be very complicated , the potential energy of it must be a _",
    "scaler _ or the vector inner product of the spins @xmath42 .",
    "this simplicity may guarantee the robustness and universality of the geomagnetism .",
    "however we can not determine the amplitude of the coupling parameter @xmath43 by a simple argument .",
    "it depends on at least the iron flow pattern , electric currents , and configuration of cyclone and anti - cyclone . on the other hand",
    "we can guess the signature of @xmath44 .",
    "electric currents are smoothly winding each tcs , and cyclone and anti - cyclone align alternately .",
    "therefore the smooth electric current yields the winding direction is the same for all anti - cyclones ( and opposite direction for all cyclones ) .",
    "this suggests the magnetic fields of anti - cyclones themselves ( and also cyclones themselves ) have a tendency to align to the same direction .",
    "this suggests the _ _  negative value for the coupling strength : _ _ @xmath45 . ] , like in the ferromagnetism in ferromagnetism has the quantum origin , which has nothing to do with our macro - spin model . ] . then the effective  curie point",
    " of these macro - spin system can be high enough and therefore , the whole system may actually show  ferromagnetism  .",
    "this makes a quite contrast to the case of the ( micro ) spins of the iron in the earth ; no ferromagnetism is produced in the core of temperature @xmath46k which well exceeds the curie point about @xmath47k .",
    "we have emphasized the necessary condition for the macro - spin @xmath48to be relevant and their interaction although the construction of the macro - spin @xmath48 is not our aim in this paper .",
    "we would like to study the inter - relation between many of such elements @xmath48  which yields various non - trivial dynamics .    before our study",
    ", there have been some works ( mazaud & laj 1989 ) , ( seki & ito 1993 ) , ( dias , franco , & papa 2008 ) in which the spin models with the interaction @xmath42 were studied to reveal the polarity flip dynamics of geomagnetism .",
    "they are based on the two - dimensional ising model and have found the polarity flip near the critical temperature . our aim to study geomagnetism in this paper",
    "is not simply to extend the similarity with phase transitions but to study wider point of view such as _ phase coexistence _ and _",
    "synchronization_.    there are two types of coupling between the spins according to the range of the interaction",
    ". if the fluid motion is responsible to the coupling , then only the neighboring spins interact with each other and yield short - range coupled - spin ( _ scs _ ) system . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electric current or magnetic fields are responsible to the coupling , then all the spins interact with the same strength and yields long - range coupled - spin system ( _ lcs _ ) .",
    "these are the two extreme ends of the series of models with finite interaction rage .",
    "we have already studied scs model in our paper ( mori 2011 ) , which successfully describes many characteristic features of geomagnetism as we now review in the next section before we study lcs model is the subsequent sections .",
    "we now briefly review our previous model for geomagnetic dynamics ( mori et al . 2011 ) , in which the concept of coupled dynamo elements is realized as short - range interacting macro - spins ( scs model ) .",
    "our intention was to establish a simple model which realizes various basic properties of geomagnetic observations based on the idea that the coupled dynamics of dynamo elements .",
    "we assume that each element has dynamo function to produce element magnetism putting the very origin of the dynamo mechanism aside .",
    "we first introduce the scs model , which is described by the lagrangian @xmath49 where@xmath50@xmath51and by appropriate dissipation and fluctuation terms .",
    "the spins are assumed to be located on a circle with equal separation ( therefore @xmath52 ) .",
    "this circle is set on the plane which includes the equator and fully immersed inside the fluid core region of the earth .",

    "the fluctuation force @xmath62 is assumed to be gaussian white noise as usual , characterized by the correlation:@xmath63then we have , so far , four parameters in our model @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 represents the tendency for each spin to be parallel to the rotational axes .",
    "larger value of @xmath65 means the dominance of the coriolis force over the other effects and the taylor - proudman theorem better holds .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 measures the strength of interaction between the element spins .",
    "it reflects the nature of the fluid flow and electric current across the neighboring spins .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 represents the whole energy dissipation @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eqs.([eqforv],[eqforb ] , [ eqfort ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 represents the inhomogeneous heat generation from the inner iron core and the random perturbation from the other element spins .",
    "we also have to specify the number @xmath69 of spins .",
    "it may depend on the geometry of the fluid core region of the earth in which cyclones and anti - cyclones are formed .",
    "we can save the number of parameters if we focus on the dynamics in long time scale and neglect the inertial term @xmath70 .",
    "then the reduced equation of motion becomes ( @xmath60),@xmath71which now has three parameters @xmath72 .",
    "the full equation eq.([eomlcs ] ) is solved in ( mori et al .",
    "the neglect of the inertial term is justified by the fact that both the methods yield almost the same results .",
    "each dynamo element represented by the spin @xmath48 naturally corresponds to a magnetic dipole located at the site @xmath41  of the dynamo element .",
    "we are interested in the order parameter @xmath73 of the set of equations eq.([redlcs ] ) defined by @xmath74this quantity @xmath73(@xmath75 $ ] ) is a good indicator of the whole magnetic field when we analyze the history of the geomagnetism though it is not the magnetic field itself .",

    "the simplest one would be described by the same lagrangian @xmath81 with eq.([k ] , [ v ] ) but the interaction of macro spins is long ranged , in the denominator in the coupling term is simply from a technical reason so that all the terms in @xmath82 formally becomes additive . ]",

    ". the long - range coupling by itself can yield sufficient chaoticity which is necessary to describe the intermittent polarity flip .",
    "it is still possible to reserve the fluctuation - dissipation terms , which does not alter the characteristic feature of the system .",

    "the reason that we did not distribute the initial spin angles in the full range @xmath90 $ ] is because we had to choose low energy to make the coexistence possible of the cluster and expanded spins , as we will explain in the next section .",

    "coexistence of the expanded and condensed phases are essential ; the latter yields the well defined polarity in magnetism eq.([m ] ) and the former triggers the intermittent flip of the polarity .",
    "this phase coexistence is naturally realized in lcs model when we choose mildly low energy values .",
    "thus , this model naturally deduces that the system energy required for intermittent polarity flip necessitates _",
    "the coexistence of the relatively steady component and the rapidly changing component in geomagnetism_. the former is of course from the condensed phase and the latter from the expanded phase .",
    "since the macro - spin has magnetic dipole , these freely moving spins in the expanded phase yields _ rapidly moving pairs of local magnetic spots of reverse polarity _",
    "superposed on the average steady dipole magnetism caused by the spins in condensed phase .",
    "these pairs also have a tendency to align on north - south direction according to the potential form in eq.([vingcs ] ) .",
    "these pairs have some similarity with the south atlantic magnetic anomaly ( sama ) observed on the core - mantle boundary ( korte 2010 ) .",
    "the above interpretation that the spins in the expanded phase trigger the flip of the global magnetic polarity suggests that a possible _ correlation between the activity of the spins in expanded phase and the duration of the fixed polarity_. actually in our numerical calculations , the expanded phase temporally disappears in the superchron , i.e. the longest period of fixed polarity .",
    "this correlation should be further studied .",
    "anomalous acceleration in the movement of the local magnetic spots of reverse polarity may predict a polarity flip in the near future .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that this set of equations eq.([eomgcs ] ) is a slight extension of the _ kuramoto model for synchronization_(kuramoto 2003 , acebron , bonilla , perez , ritort , & spigler 2005 ) by the change of potential : @xmath132 , and the reduction of the order of time derivative : @xmath133 .",
    "the potential @xmath134 forces each angle @xmath56  to rotate with the fixed frequency @xmath135 despite the lack of the inertial term .",
    "therefore the latter simplification @xmath136 is possible in kuramoto model .",
    "kuramoto model is a set of long - range coupled oscillators with different frequencies .",
    "if there were no interaction between the oscillators , then each phase of the oscillator behaves independently .",
    "however if the long - range interaction is sufficiently strong , then the phases of oscillators _ synchronize _ with each other despite the difference in each frequencies @xmath137 .",
    "kuramoto model very generally describes the synchronization processes of many type of oscillators and limit cycles including chemical and biological systems .",
    "it is remarkable that lcs model can also describe the synchronization of element spins and yield _ quasi - periodic motion of the mean field _ , by simply changing the parameters .",
    "the first term of rhs in eq.([vingcs ] ) gives independent non - linear oscillations of each spin angle . since the oscillation is nonlinear and the amplitudes are different from spin to spin , the phases of the spins behave very chaotically .",
    "the second term of rhs in eq.([vingcs ] ) gives the cosine potential between all the spin pairs ( @xmath138 ) and thus naturally yields the tendency for all the pairs to synchronize with each other .",
    "whether the whole synchronization actually takes place or not depends on the balance between the two terms . if the pairwise interaction @xmath139  is sufficiently large in lcs model , then the synchronization takes place as in the case of kuramoto model .",
    "however , reflecting the strong non - linearity of the cosine potential , the synchronized oscillation becomes quasi - periodic in general .",
    "this potential ability of lcs model to describe synchronization physics is especially important when we apply lcs to the solar magnetism in later sections .",
    "we would like to argue , in this section , to what extent the lcs  model can be _ general _ in wider contexts .",
    "the concept of the coupled dynamo elements itself , as we have discussed in section 2 , is general and is not in principle restricted to geomagnetism .",
    "we expect the same for lcs model , which is the minimal realization of this concept .",
    "the magnetic fields associated with celestial objects are quite common in the universe ; many planets , satellites , and the stars including our sun .",
    "although the magnetic fields of these objects have variety that is quite different from the geomagnetism , all the magnetic fields are thought to be generated and supported by the robust dynamo mechanism .",
    "however the lcs model is at most a phenomenological model to describe dynamo systems .",
    "the lcs model is simply a macroscopic description and can not be directly deduced from the microscopic mhd equations eqs.([eqforv]-jb ) , which are especially important for quantitative argument in wider contexts .",
    "therefore we _ need to supplement lcs model with the mhd equations_.    first we examine the _ energy flow _ for geomagnetism .",
    "geomagnetic fields would be amplified by the inward - winding motion of the convection vortex , anti - cyclone .",
    "this inward motion is caused by the coriolis force induced by the earth rotation although the rotation itself can not directly transfer its energy to geomagnetism .",
    "on the other hand , the convective motion of the iron fluid is supported by the thermal flow from the central region of the earth .",
    "this flow is mainly supported by the release of the gravitational potential by the core sinking .",
    "thus the thermal flow accelerates the convective motion and supports the inward - winding force to amplify the magnetic fields through the coriolis force .",
    "one essential fact for this thermal energy flow is that the main dissipation is due to the joule heat .",
    "this is because the magnetic prandtl number @xmath140 , i.e. the ratio of the time scale of magnetic diffusion ( @xmath141 )  and that of convective diffusion ( @xmath142 ) , is actually very small : @xmath143 .",
    "we now closely look at the basic equations eqs.([eqforv ] , [ eqforb ] ) in the above picture of energy flow . from eq.([eqforb ] ) , we first notice that the steady state for the magnetic field requires the _ energy balance on average _ : @xmath144 , which reduces to the relation which is independent of @xmath14 , @xmath145where @xmath146 is the fe - core radius and @xmath147 is the radius of the taylor cell .",
    "the existence of this special scale is essential to our model to characterize the dynamo elements ; most of the relevant process of dynamo takes place on this scale .",
    "this small scale compared with the core size is foreseen from the order in eq.([rm ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field is amplified by the inward winding motion of the convection vortex through the term @xmath148 until this steady state eq.([v - steady ] ) is realized . on the other hand ,",
    "the inward - winding motion of flow is generated by the term @xmath149 in eq.(eqforv ) , and this term should eventually _ balances _ with the backreaction from the generated magnetic pressure through the term @xmath150  in the same equation .",
    "therefore in the steady state , we have the estimate of the typical strength of the magnetic field @xmath151 at the scale @xmath147 , the scale of the taylor cell , as    @xmath152    the observed magnetic field @xmath153  at the earth surface is related with this estimated @xmath151  through the magnetic flux conservation as , @xmath154where @xmath69 is the number of taylor cells in the core and @xmath155  is the earth radius .",
    "we simply assumed that all the taylor cell is the same scale and the magnetic fields associated with tc are parallel to the rotation axes of the earth for simplicity . combining the above three equations",
    ", we have @xmath156and the corresponding ( virtual ) magnetic moment @xmath157  becomes@xmath158    in the geomagnetic case , we have chosen @xmath87 and putting reasonable values , @xmath159 km , @xmath160 km , @xmath161emens / m , @xmath162kg / m@xmath163 , and assuming @xmath164 , we have @xmath165tesla from eq.([bout ] ) , and @xmath166m/@xmath167 from eq.([v - steady ] ) .",
    "although the value of @xmath153is consistent with observations the value of @xmath168  is only @xmath169 of the estimated speed of the convection flow simply from the west - ward drift motion .",
    "if this discrepancy is real , the time scale of the magnetic field variation or of the electric current change is about ten times larger than the convective flow speed .",
    "this point should be further studied .",
    "the estimate of the effective magnetic moment in eq.([d ] ) is general since it is deduced simply from the basic equations ( [ eqforv ] , eqforb ) based on the lcs model .",
    "the expression eq.([d ] ) is consistent with the general claim in the literature ( christensen2010 ) , ( stevenson 2010 ) that the planetary magnetic fields are essentially determined from the factor @xmath170 .",
    "we can step further and estimate the unknown factor @xmath171 in eq.([d ] ) . by using various data for celestial objects , but assuming @xmath172 is a constant",

    ", we can draw a similar graph for @xmath181 against @xmath124  in fig.([fig6 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this relation turns out to be almost a constant within a factor @xmath182 for the whole mass range of 8-digits as shown in fig.([fig6 - 1 ] ) .",

    "these quantities are normalized by the values of earth .",
    "the data are from stevenson ( 2010 ) .",
    "eulopa and callisto are excluded from the figure because their magnetic fields are probably induced from the external fields ( stevenson 2010 ) .",
    "the value @xmath183 t is used for the solar dipole magnetic field .",
    "the quantity @xmath184 turns out to be an almost constant within a factor @xmath182 for the mass range over 8 digits .",
    "this fact suggests the scaling @xmath185 , which determins the number and the radius of the dynamo element in general .",
    ", width=453 ]    the factor @xmath186 is important for this constancy yields the smallest variation of the data as far as we have checked .",
    "when we choose @xmath124 for the extensive variable , the best index was @xmath187 which is @xmath188 within an error . ] .",
    "we can deduce the scaling formula , from this phenomenological relation , as @xmath189 in other words , the scaling eq.([d ] ) holds if we choose eq.(taylorcellscaling ) .",
    "this phenomenological scaling is helpful to reveal the number of dynamo elements .",
    "for example , if we suppose the parameter @xmath190 is almost a constant for various objects , and @xmath87  for earth , we have @xmath191 for the sun .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that the planets , satellites and stars are very different with each other and the structure of dynamo mechanism is different ( stanley 2010 ) despite the above generality .    keeping the above caution in mind , it is interesting to try the unified view of planetary magnetism within our model . in",
    "the context of the lcs model , observed large dipole tilt more than @xmath192 and the quadrupole moment of magnetic fields in _ uranus and neptune _ are not exceptional .",
    "the magnetic field described by lcs model naturally becomes irregular and asymmetric when occasional large excursion takes place .",
    "we may observing these irregular and asymmetric fields in the present uranus and neptune .",
    "moreover in the context of lcs model , almost axis symmetric magnetic field of _ saturn _ does not conflict with the anti - dynamo theorem , which inhibits dynamo function in  the axisymmetic steady configuration .",
    "this is because individual element dynamo yields magnetic field independently from others and easily violates axis symmetry of the whole system .",
    "the magnetic field in lcs model is rapidly changing and steady condition is also violated .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , a simple argument on the mhd equations based on the lcs model can yield a general scaling law for planets and satellites .",
    "this was useful to estimate the scale of dynamo elements . in this section",
    ", we would like to explore this generality of the lcs model by applying it to the solar magnetic dynamics .",
    "lcs model does not specify the macro - spin or dynamo element .",
    "the macro - spin can express any subsystem which has minimal dynamo property . typically the element is the inward - winding vorticity . in case of our sun",
    ", the macro - spin may be the convecting vortex deep inside the solar surface .",
    "it may happen that this region is turbulent and the hierarchy of vortices yield a network of many dynamo elements .",
    "the very end of this hierarchy may appear on the entire surface of the sun , possibly as the supergranulations .",
    "recently the pattern of the supergranulation is observed by using the local helioseismology ( nagashima 2010 ) . on top of these supergranulation , strong horizontal magnetic field",
    "is observed everywhere on the surface ( ishikawa 2008 ) .",
    "we speculate that these vortices associated with dynamo function may fill the entire convecting region inside the sun .",
    "the solar magnetism changes its polarity quasi - regularly with the period about 22 years , which synchronizes with the solar activity of period 11 years .",
    "the solar activity can be roughly measured simply by counting the sunspots ( sidc 2011 ) .",
    "we show this daily count profile in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 - 1 ] ) top , during the past two hundred years .",
    "the power spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 - 1 ] ) bottom , reveals the clear periodicity of about 11 years , as well as the period of about a month .",
    "the latter period is an artifact reflecting the systematic sunspot change on the solar surface which rotates with this period .",
    "what is interesting for us is the scaling property with index @xmath193 , near to @xmath194 , on top of the two peaks associated with the above periods .",
    "one - over - f noise or the pink noise , _",
    "i.e. _ its power spectrum scales with index @xmath194 , has been observed everywhere in nature .",

    "the former peak corresponds to the 11 year solar activity cycle and the latter peak fictitiously appears corresponds to a month the solar rotation period . , width=453 ]",
    "it is remarkable that the lcs model shows quasi - periodic polarity flip , which resembles the solar magnetism , as a result of synchronization of many spins .",
    "for the synchronization process to set in , we need large number of spins ( @xmath197 ) and low potential barrier ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "then the spins in lcs model can naturally synchronize to yield quasi - periodic motion like in the kuramoto model .",
    "for example in a numerical demonstrations , we set @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 , and obtained the result as shown in fig.([fig7 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the top figure shows the time evolution of the order parameter @xmath202 defined in eq.([m ] ) .",
    "quasi - periodicity in its evolution is apparent .",
    "the amplitude irregularly varies and even becomes almost flat in some periods .",
    "the bottom figure shows its power spectrum . beside the apparent peak corresponding to the quasi - periodicity , one - over - f noise , actually the power @xmath203 ,",
    "is observed in low frequency region .",
    "however this result needs to be refined before serious discussions .",
    "for example , the number of spins @xmath204 is apparently too small compared with the previous estimate @xmath205 in the last section .",
