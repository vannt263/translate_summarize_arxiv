    "recently there has been increased interest in the possibility of using organic molecules as electronic components in nanoscale devices .",
    "one of the most important issues is the role of molecule - metal contact . the charge injection at the metal - molecule interface is usually modelled by the energy dependent probability for a substrate electron to tunnel to the molecular wire .",
    "the magnitude of the tunnelling probability depends on lineup of the molecular wire electronic states and the metal fermi level .",
    "when a closely packed array of molecular wires is formed on the metal electrode , the molecular states form bands dispersive in the lateral direction .",
    "this suggests that the tunnelling probability in addition to the energy of the injected electron depends also on the lateral component of the electron wavevector .",
    "the change of the metal work function due to a self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) may be employed in device applications to assist the charge injection into the molecular wire @xcite .",
    "the work function of a crystal surface has generally two contributions @xcite : ( 1 ) the electrostatic barrier due to the distortion in the charge distribution at the surface and ( 2 ) the many - body effects of the screened hole .",
    "it is important to know the relative contributions of the two components for the successful design of molecular electronic devices .    in this paper",
    "we present density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the electronic structure of sams of phenylthiolate ( pt = -s - c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) on noble metal substrates cu(111 ) and au(111 ) .",
    "we find significant lateral dispersion of the molecular electronic states derived from the molecular orbitals of the sam .",
    "our calculations aim to address three essential questions : ( 1 ) what are the molecular states closest to metal fermi level and therefore the most important for transport properties ; ( 2 ) how large is the lateral dispersion of those states ; ( 3 ) what is the largest contribution to the workfunction change associated with sam formation , for which we find the electrostatic contribution from the polar molecules as determined by the dipole moment of the isolated array of molecules in addition to that of the bare metal surface .",
    "in addition we calculate two - photon photoemission ( 2ppe ) spectra using dft wavefunctions and the work function of the sam / cu(111 ) system to compare with the experiments by zhu _ et .",
    "we use the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method @xcite with local orbital extensions @xcite in the wien2k implementation @xcite .",
    "the gga @xcite exchange - correlation potential was used .",
    "well - converged basis sets were employed with a 4.7 ry plane wave cut off .",
    "five special k - points were used to sample the two dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "the surface plane was taken as the @xmath2 plane .",
    "we used slab calculations based on a super cell with three metal layers covered on one side by a pt monolayer for electronic structure calculations , and six metal layers with both sides covered for work function calculations .",
    "the pt monolayer is of the so called @xmath3 type @xcite , with one molecule per three substrate surface metal atoms .",
    "the former are arranged in a triangular lattice with side @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the side of the triangular lattice formed by metal atoms @xmath6 in the ( 111 ) plane . for @xmath6=au and cu ,",
    "the corresponding cross - section area for molecule is , respectively , 21.6 @xmath7 and 16.9 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the cross - sectional mean area of a pt molecule ( when directed normal to the substrate ) is 21.1 @xmath7 , slightly less than the above value based on the au substrate , thus indicating the possibility of a small degree of tilt @xcite , whereas no tilt is expected in the case of the cu substrate .",
    "the geometry of the molecular array has been fully relaxed on an unrelaxed substrate with metal atoms in ideal crystal positions .",
    "the monolayer on the au substrate was found tilted by 18@xmath8 , consistent with related experimental data @xcite . in the calculation ,",
    "the pt molecule was constrained so as to maintain @xmath9 intramolecular symmetry @xcite .",
    "the lowest - energy binding site was the au - au bridge , analogous to the case of alkanethiols studied by selloni _ et .",
    "the s atom height is 2.1  .",
    "starting with alignment normal to the substrate , with the projection of the pt plane parallel to a nearest - neighbor au - au vector , the pt was tilted in the direction perpendicular to its plane ( tilting in the orthogonal direction caused a sharp rise in energy ) . the calculated tilt relaxation energy per molecule ( @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) was of the order of @xmath12 at room temperature , indicating the likelihood of appreciable thermal fluctuations , similar to the situation noted in @xcite .    in the case of the cu substrate",
    "we find zero tilt angle for the monolayer due to the close spacing controlled by the cu lattice constant , with the lowest energy when sulfur binds to the hollow site .",
    "the height of the s atom is 1.73  .",
    "the binding energy for the bridge site is higher by 170 mev .",
    "the frozen lattice approximation used here may cause a shift of the energy difference in binding energy of a few tens of mev for different adsorption sites , but it should not affect much the work function and the shape of the dispersion curves .",

    "there are three electronic states involved in the 2ppe spectra : initial ( _ i _ ) , intermediate ( _ k _ ) , and the final ( _ f _ ) . if one of those states is localized and has the largest dipole matrix element in comparison with the rest of the states , then three scenarios are possible for the variation of kinetic energy ( @xmath26 ) with respect to the excitation photon energy @xmath27 , which is chosen to be less than the workfunction of the substrate : ( 1 ) @xmath28 ; ( 2 ) @xmath29 , and ( 3 ) invariance with respect to @xmath27 . for pt on cu(111 ) , two cases are reported @xcite : case(2 ) in which the intermediate state ( i ) is assigned as a lumo lying below the vacuum at 3.3 ev and case(3 ) , in which the final state ( f ) is assigned as a lumo lying above the vacuum at 6.4 ev ( relative to e@xmath18 ) .",

    "the most dispersive molecular bands are of side carbon character ( c@xmath16 ) .",

    "the energy positions of the observed molecular states at 6.4 ev and 3.4 ev are in reasonable correspondence with our calculated values of 6.0 ev and 2.8 ev , respectively .",

    "alternatively , the interpretation of the workfunction measurements in one photon photoemission spectra can be complicated if there is an exit barrier for substrate electrons to tunnel through the interface",
    ". then the onset of the one - photon photoemission signal may be due to the finite energy electrons with respect to the vacuum level .",
    "this in turn would imply that the agreement between the theory and the experiment for the energies of the lumo orbitals measured in 2ppe is accidental .",
    "indeed dft is known to underestimate the bandgaps in semiconductors .",
    "on the other hand the energy differences between the empty states are more reliable in dft and in the experiment the energy difference between the two lumo s is also independent of the workfunction value .",
    "we find an electrostatic contribution to the work function change of 2.8 ev ( associated with sam formation ) to be the dominant effect .",
    "therefore the dipole moment of the molecular sam in the absence of the metal substrate can be used to predict the the workfunction change of the covered substrate provided the charge transfer and correlation effects do not contribute much to the workfunction change as in the case studied here .",

    "<S> we use first principles density functional theory to calculate the electronic structure of the phenylthiolate ( s - c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) self - assembled monolayer ( sam ) on cu(111 ) and au(111 ) substrates . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant lateral dispersion of the sam molecular states and discuss its implications for transport properties of the molecular wire array . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the two photon photoemission spectra and the work function of the sam on cu(111 ) and compare them with the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> our results are used to discuss assignments of the observed spectral data and yield predictions for new electronic states due to the monolayer not yet accessed experimentally . </S>"
