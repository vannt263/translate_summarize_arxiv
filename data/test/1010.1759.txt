    "since the appearance of the first high - energy colliders in the 1980 s , the study of `` jets '' of particles produced in the final state has proved to be a powerful tool for probing the underlying elementary dynamics of the strong force as described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "jets have been extensively studied at @xmath2 ( lep , slc ) , @xmath3 ( hera ) and @xmath4/@xmath5 ( tevatron , rhic , lhc ) colliders , with a wide variety of jet algorithms , including infrared and collinear ( irc ) safe algorithms such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a topic of current interest is the use of jets in heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions , where , for example , they can be used to probe the hot , dense medium . in the past few years , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has amassed significant numbers of copper - copper and gold - gold collisions at nucleon - nucleon centre of mass energies up to @xmath6 , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) should deliver high yields of lead - lead collisions at much higher energies in the near future .",
    "the main obstacle to studying jets in hi collisions is the presence of the huge background given by the underlying event ( ue ) produced simultaneously with the hard nucleon - nucleon collision that initiates the high - transverse momentum jet of interest .",
    "this ue needs to be properly subtracted from the momentum of a given jet in order to reconstruct its `` true '' momentum , _",
    "i.e._the one it would have in the absence of the ue contribution .",
    "this problem is of course well known , and is also present , though to a much smaller extent , in jet studies in proton - proton collisions .",
    "various approaches to address it have been proposed ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite two of us proposed a jet area - related technique to determine the transverse momentum density of a sufficiently uniformly distributed background and to subtract it from the jet momenta .",
    "the method of @xcite introduced several novel steps , such as the measurement of jet areas , and procedures to determine the transverse - momentum density of the underlying event and/or pileup .",
    "subsequent work of ours @xcite has sought to provide firmer foundations for these concepts and methods , as well as practical tests in @xmath5 jet reconstruction tasks with simulated events  @xcite .",
    "preliminary experimental jet measurements from the star collaboration at rhic , whose analysis is partially based on the ideas of @xcite , have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    "we give a systematic examination of the performance of such methods for heavy - ion collisions , applying them to monte carlo simulations for rhic and the lhc .",
    "in particular , we determine the accuracy with which jet momenta can be effectively reconstructed , comparing the performance of several different jet algorithms .",
    "jets in hi collisions are produced in an environment that is far from conducive to their detection and accurate measurement .",
    "monte carlo simulations ( and real rhic data ) for gold - gold collisions at @xmath7  gev ( per nucleon - nucleon collision ) show that the transverse momentum density @xmath8 of final - state particles is about 100 gev per unit area ( in the rapidity - azimuth plane ) . for lead - lead collisions at @xmath9  tev at the lhc",
    "this figure is expected to increase by some factor @xmath10 .",
    "this means that jets returned by jet definitions with a radius parameter of , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath11 , will contain background contamination of the order of @xmath12 50 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "a related , and perhaps more challenging obstacle to accurate jet reconstruction is due to the fluctuations both of the background level ( from event to event , but also from point to point in a single event ) and of the jet area itself : knowing the contamination level ` on average ' is not sufficient to accurately reconstruct each individual jet .    a wide range of strategies",
    "have already been advocated to reconstruct jets in hi collisions .",
    "just to mention them briefly , approaches to hi jet reconstruction may involve one or more of the following measures : choosing a jet algorithm returning jets with an area as constant as possible ; eliminating from the clustering all particles below a given transverse momentum threshold , say @xmath14 gev ; measuring the background level in a region of the detector thought to be not affected by the hard event ; or parametrising the average background level ( and fluctuations ) in terms of some other measured properties of the event , such as its centrality .",
    "our framework has the following characteristics :    * we shall restrict ourselves to irc safe jet algorithms , to ensure that measurements can be meaningfully compared to higher - order perturbative qcd calculations . * the jet algorithms we use will",
    "not be limited to those yielding jets of regular shape .",
    "* our analysis will avoid excluding small transverse momentum particles from the clustering .",
    "doing so is collinear - unsafe and inevitably biases the reconstructed jet momenta , which must then be corrected using monte carlo simulations , which can have substantial uncertainties in their modelling of jet quenching and energy loss .",
    "instead , we shall try to achieve a bias - free reconstructed jet , working with all the particles in the event .",
    "cutoffs of their own .",
    "these detector artefacts should not have too large an impact on collinear safety as long as they appear at momenta of the order of the hadronisation scale of qcd , _",
    "i.e._a few hundred mev . ] * the background level will be determined through adaptations of the jet - area / median procedure suggested in @xcite and analysed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is designed to give an estimate of the background that is minimally affected by the presence of hard jets .",
    "in order to test the effectiveness of subtracting the underlying event in a heavy - ion collision , and determine the quality of the jet reconstruction , we need access to the idealised hard jets , without the background , as a reference . this can be done by considering a simulated hard @xmath5 event first in isolation , and then embedded in a heavy - ion event . for clarity in the discussions",
    ", we shall adopt the following terminology :    * the _ hard event _ refers to the hard @xmath5 event alone , without a heavy - ion background ; * the _ full event _ refers to combination of the hard event and the hi background ( which possibly includes many semi - hard events of its own ) ; * _ hard jets _ and _ full jets",
    "_ refers to jets from the hard and full events , respectively .",
    "note that though making the distinction between a hard and a full event is not possible with real data , it is feasible in certain monte carlo studies .",
    "one should nevertheless be aware that the extent to which such a distinction is physically meaningful is a question that remains open in view of the numerous issues related to the interaction between an energetic parton and the medium through which it travels .    if the monte carlo program used to simulate heavy - ion events explicitly provides a separation between hard events and a soft part ",
    "_ e.g._as does hydjet @xcite  one can extract one of the former as the single hard event and take the complete event as the full one .",
    "alternatively , one can generate a hard event independently and embed it in a heavy - ion event ( obtained from a monte carlo or from real collisions ) to obtain the full event .",
    "this second approach , which we have adopted for the bulk of results presented here because of its greater computational efficiency , is sensible as long as the embedded hard event is much harder than any of the semi - hard events that tend to be present in the background .",
    "for the transverse momenta that we consider , this condition is typically fulfilled .",
    "note however that for studies in which the presence of a hard collision is not guaranteed , _",
    "e.g._the evaluation of fake - jet rates , one should use the first approach .      to measure the performance of our heavy - ion background subtraction procedure",
    "we apply it to both hard and full events .",
    "we then take the two hardest resulting jets in each hard event and compare them to the corresponding subtracted jets in the full event .",
    "to do this in practice , we need a method to match the jets obtained from the full event to those from the hard event alone , to make sure that we are comparing the same object .",
    "in other analyses , this matching was typically performed in terms of the position of the jet in the rapidity - azimuth plane , requiring that the two jet axes not differ by more than a given @xmath15 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath16 is an arbitrary choice , and values between 0.1 and 0.3 have been often used . in order to avoid the arbitrariness of the @xmath16 choice",
    ", we propose a different prescription : a jet reconstructed in the full event is considered matched to a hard jet _ if the constituents common to both the hard and the full jet make up at least 50% of the transverse momentum of the constituents of the hard jet_. of the @xmath1 of the hard jet after ue subtraction as in section  [ sec : subtraction ] . in practice , this detail has negligible impact on matching efficiencies and other results . ]",
    "this definition has the advantage that for a given hard jet , at most one full jet can satisfy this criterion , therefore avoiding having to deal with multiple positive matchings .",
    "another advantage is that it automatically rejects fake matchings given by a soft jet that happens to be close to a hard one .    for a matched pair of jets",
    ", we shall use the notation @xmath17  and @xmath18  for the transverse momentum of the jet in the hard and full event respectively , and @xmath19  and @xmath20  for their subtracted equivalents .",
    "the quantity that we shall mostly concentrate on is the @xmath1 offset , @xmath21 between the momentum of the background - subtracted jet in the full event and its equivalent in the hard event .",
    "large deviations from zero will indicate a poor subtraction .",
    "events without any matched jets are simply discarded and instead contribute to the evaluation of matching inefficiencies ( see section  [ sec : efficiency ] ) .",
    "the average of the @xmath1 shift over many events , @xmath22 , is only one measure that one may examine to establish the quality of jet reconstruction ; its dispersion , @xmath23 can be another important one .",
    "this is especially true in the case of steeply - falling jet spectra , where this dispersion can have a large impact on the measured cross section , necessitating delicate deconvolutions , also known as `` unfolding '' .    in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on these two quality measures @xmath24 and @xmath25 , keeping only the pair of jets that have been matched to one of the two hardest ( subtracted ) jets in the hard event .",
    "small ( absolute ) values of both @xmath24 and @xmath25 will be the sign of a good subtraction . in practice a trade - off may exist in offset versus dispersion : which one to optimise may depend on the specific observable one wants to measure . and @xmath25 may not , in general , fully characterise the quality of the reconstruction , as the distribution of @xmath26 may be non - gaussian . ]",
    "quantifying the quality of background subtraction using monte carlo simulations has several advantages . besides providing a practical way of generating the hard `` signal '' separately from the soft background",
    ", one can easily check the robustness of one s conclusions by changing the hard jet or the background sample .",
    "one difficulty that arises in gauging the quality of jet reconstruction in heavy - ion collisions comes from the expectation that parton fragmentation in a hot medium will differ from that in a vacuum .",
    "this difference is often referred to as _ jet quenching _",
    "@xcite ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the details of jet quenching are far less well established than those of vacuum fragmentation and can have an effect on the quality of jet reconstruction . here",
    "we shall examine the reconstruction of both unquenched and quenched jets .",
    "for the latter it will be particularly important to be able to test more than one quenching model , in order to help build confidence in our conclusions about any reconstruction bias that may additionally exist in the presence of quenching .    in practice , for this paper we have used both the fortran ( v1.6 ) @xcite and the c++ ( v2.1 ) @xcite versions of hydjet to generate the background .",
    "hard jets have been generated with pythia  6.4 @xcite , either running it standalone , or using the version embedded in hydjet v1.6 .",
    "the quenching effects have been studied using both qpythia @xcite and pyquen @xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the last few years have seen many developments in the field of jet clustering , with the appearance of fast implementations  @xcite of the @xmath0  @xcite and the cambridge / aachen  @xcite sequential recombination algorithms , and the introduction of the siscone  @xcite and anti-@xmath0  @xcite algorithms .    besides these four main infrared - and - collinear - safe jet algorithms , a number of recent papers ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) ,",
    "have introduced and studied jet - cleaning techniques in order to help the reconstruction of jets by reducing the ue contamination .",
    "`` filtering '' @xcite works by reclustering each jet with a radius @xmath27 smaller than the original radius @xmath28 and keeping only the @xmath29 hardest subjets ( background subtraction is applied to each of the subjets before deciding which ones to keep ) .",
    "other similar techniques , `` trimming '' and `` pruning '' , that exploit the substructure of jets have also been introduced recently @xcite and , in @xmath5 environments , have been found to give benefits comparable to those of filtering .",
    "note that the filtering that we use here is unrelated to the gaussian filter approach of @xcite ( not used in this paper as no public code is currently available ) .",
    "in analogy with the systematic analysis of the performance of various jet definitions in the kinematic reconstruction of dijet systems at the lhc @xcite , here we will study how different algorithms behave in the case of hi collisions .",
    "we will use the @xmath0 , cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) , and anti-@xmath0 algorithms , as well as filtering applied to cambridge / aachen ( c / a(filt ) ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we have not used siscone , as its relatively slower speed compared to the sequential recombination algorithms makes it less suitable for a hi environment .",
    "all the algorithms have been used through their fast implementation available in the package @xcite , version  2.4.2 .",
    "additionally some features of a forthcoming fastjet release have been used to help simplify our analyses .      , the _ circular _ range @xmath32 and the _ doughnut _ range @xmath33 .",
    "the last three are local ranges with a position depending on the jet being subtracted .",
    "see the text for detailed definitions.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in order to subtract the hi background from the hard jets , we will mainly follow the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "when clustering the event we determine the 4-vector active area @xmath34 @xcite of each jet @xmath35 , as well as an estimate of the background density @xmath8 .",
    "then for each jet @xmath35 , we subtract from its four - momentum the expected background contamination : @xmath36 the background transverse - momentum density per unit area , @xmath8 , is determined , event - by - event , as proposed in @xcite . in that paper two",
    "ways of determining @xmath8 were explored .",
    "one was to take a global background - estimation range @xmath37 , covering the full rapidity - azimuth plane up to some rapidity @xmath38 ; one then considered the set of ratios of transverse components of the momentum and area 4-vectors , @xmath39 , for the jets within this range .",
    "the median of this set was used as an estimate for @xmath8 : @xmath40 where the subscript @xmath37 explicitly denotes that the background density has been calculated using only jets in the range @xmath37 .",
    "this method assumes that the background level is sufficiently constant within @xmath37 .",
    "this condition is known to be violated when going to sufficiently large rapidity , and the effect is particularly marked in heavy ion collisions .",
    "for this reason , it was alternatively proposed in @xcite to fit the mean @xmath39 as a function of rapidity @xmath41 with a quadratic functional form @xmath42 .    while working on this paper , and partly inspired by discussions with members of the star collaboration ( c.f .",
    "also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we came to the conclusion that neither of these two methods allows one to extract sufficiently accurate values of @xmath8 in the context of hi collisions .",
    "we propose therefore a variant of the first method , namely making the background - estimation range _ local _ and dependent on a given jet s position .",
    "graphical representations of a global range , as well as of three possible local ranges that we shall use hereafter , are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ranges ] .",
    "more specifically , for a given jet @xmath35 , our three local ranges are defined as follows ,    * the _ strip _ range , @xmath43 , includes the jets",
    "@xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 , * the _ circular _ range , @xmath46 , includes the jets",
    "@xmath44 satisfying @xmath47 , * the _ doughnut _ range , @xmath33 , includes the jets @xmath44 satisfying @xmath48 .    using @xmath49 to denote any local range around jet @xmath35 ,",
    "the background density will then depend on the jet being subtracted and will be estimated using @xmath50 it is important to be aware that the estimate of the background density @xmath8 is just an input to eq .",
    "( [ eq : subtraction ] ) and that the jet definition that is used for the computation of @xmath8 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : median ] ) or ( [ eq : local_median ] ) can be different from the jet definition used to obtain the `` physical '' jets and subtract them in eq .",
    "( [ eq : subtraction ] ) .",
    "the only two recommended jet algorithms for the task of determining @xmath8 are the @xmath0 and c / a algorithms ( see @xcite ) ; others are not ideal because they return many jets with very small areas , which distorts the median procedure .",
    "the radius , @xmath51 , used in the jet definition for determining @xmath8 can also differ from that , @xmath28 , used to find the jets .",
    "when using a local range , the underlying idea is to limit the sensitivity to the long - range variations of the background density , by using only the jets in the vicinity of the jet we want to subtract . in practice ,",
    "a compromise needs to be found between choosing a range small enough to get a valid local estimation , but also large enough to contain a sufficiently large number of background ( soft ) jets for the estimation of the median to be reliable .",
    "two effects need to be considered : ( 1 ) statistical fluctuations in the estimation of the background and ( 2 ) biases due to the presence of a hard jet in the region used to estimate the background .    1 .",
    "if we require that the dispersion in the reconstructed jet @xmath1 coming from the statistical fluctuations in the estimation of the background does not amount to more than a fraction @xmath52 of the overall @xmath25 , then as discussed in appendix  [ app : minrange - fluct ] the range needs to cover an area @xmath53 such that @xmath54 taking @xmath55 and @xmath11 this corresponds to an area @xmath56 . for the applications below ,",
    "when clustering with radius @xmath28 , we have used the rapidity - strip ranges @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the circular range @xmath59 and the doughnut range @xmath60 .",
    "one can check that their areas are compatible with the @xmath61 lower - limit estimated above .",
    "the bias in the estimate of @xmath8 due to the presence of @xmath62 hard jets in the range is given roughly by @xmath63 as discussed in @xcite and appendix  [ app : minrange - bias ] .",
    "the ensuing bias on the @xmath1 can be estimated as @xmath64 ( for anti-@xmath0 jets ) . for @xmath11 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the bias in the reconstructed jet @xmath1",
    "is @xmath68 . given @xmath69 in the @xmath70 range ( as we will find in section  [ sec : results ] ) this corresponds to a @xmath71 bias . in order to eliminate this small bias , we will often choose to exclude the two hardest jets in each event when determining of @xmath8 .    a third potential bias discussed in ref .",

    "the change of 0.40.6  gev ( both for rhic and the lhc ) is in reasonable agreement with the analytic estimate of about 0.6 gev for rhic and the lhc obtained from @xmath112 with @xmath113 calculated using eq .",

    "other features that can be understood qualitatively include for example the differences between the two strip and the global ( 2  excl ) range for rhic : while the rapidity width of the global range lies in between that of the two strip ranges , the global range gives a lower @xmath24 than both , corresponding to a larger @xmath8 estimate , which is reasonable because the global range is centred on @xmath114 , whereas the strip ranges are mostly centred at larger rapidities where the background is lower .",

    ", one way of thinking about a fake jet is that it is a reconstructed jet ( with significant @xmath1 ) that is due not to the presence of an actual hard jet , but rather due to an upwards fluctuation of the soft background .",
    "the difficulty with this definition is that there is no uniquely - defined separation between `` hard '' jets and soft background .",
    "this can be illustrated with the example of how hydjet simulates rhic collisions : one event typically consists of a soft hydro background supplemented with @xmath188 @xmath5 collisions , each simulated with a minimum @xmath1 cut of @xmath189 on the @xmath190 scattering .",
    "to some approximation , the properties of the full heavy - ion events remain relatively unchanged if one modifies the number of @xmath5 collisions and corresponding @xmath1 cut and also retunes the soft background . the fact that this changes the number of hard jets provides one illustration of the issue",
    "that the soft / hard separation is ill - defined . additionally , while there are @xmath188 semi - hard @xmath5 collisions ( @xmath191 mostly central semi - hard jets event separately to obtain a long list of @xmath5 jets from all the separate hard events . ] ) in an event , there is only space within ( say ) the acceptance of rhic for @xmath192 jets .",
    "thus there is essentially no region in an event which does not have a semi - hard jet . from this point of view , every reconstructed jet corresponds to a hard @xmath5 jet and there are no fake jets at all .      for inclusive analyses , such as a measurement of the inclusive jet spectrum ,",
    "this last point is particularly relevant , because every jet in the event contributes to the measurement .",
    "then , the issue of fakes can be viewed as one of unfolding . in that respect",
    "it becomes instructive , for a given bin of the reconstructed heavy - ion @xmath1 , to ask what the corresponding matched @xmath5 jet transverse momenta were .",

    "if there is no matched jet ( this occurs only rarely ) then we fill the bin at @xmath195 .",

    "the origin is dominated by low @xmath186 .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , given the result in section  [ eq : shift - dispersion - on - spectrum ] that the @xmath186 origin is expected to be @xmath197 lower than @xmath187 for anti-@xmath0 jets  additionally , that result assumed an exponential spectrum for the inclusive jet distribution , whereas the distribution rises substantially faster towards low @xmath186 .",
    "as @xmath187 increases one sees that the contribution of high @xmath186 jets increases , in a manner not too inconsistent with the expected @xmath197 shift , though the @xmath186 distribution remains rather broad and a peak persists at small @xmath186 .",
    "these plots suggest that an inclusive jet distribution measurement with the anti-@xmath0 algorithm at rhic is not completely trivial since , up to rather large @xmath187 , one is still sensitive to the jet distribution at small values of @xmath186 where the separation between `` hard '' jets and the soft medium is less clear .",

    "[ fig : origin ] shows that different @xmath187 have complementary sensitivities to different parts of the @xmath186 spectrum .",

    "such a reduction can make it noticeably easier to perform the unfolding .",
    "the impact of a reduction in @xmath25 is illustrated in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ fig : origin ] , which shows the result for c / a(filt ) . here",
    ", even the @xmath196 bin for @xmath187 shows a moderate-@xmath1 peak in the distribution of @xmath186 , and in the @xmath199 bin the low-@xmath1 `` fake '' peak has disappeared almost entirely .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath186 peak is centred about @xmath162 lower than the centre of the @xmath187 bin , remarkably consistent with the calculations of section  [ eq : shift - dispersion - on - spectrum ] .",
    "overall , therefore , unfolding with c / a(filt ) will be easier than with anti-@xmath0 .",
    "corresponding plots for the lhc are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : origin_lhc ] .",
    "while c / a(filt ) s lower dispersion still gives it an advantage over anti-@xmath0 , for @xmath200 , anti-@xmath0 does now reach a domain where the original @xmath5 jets are themselves always hard .",
    "procedures to reject fake jets have been proposed , in  @xcite .",
    "they are based on a cut on ( collinear unsafe ) jet shape properties and it is thus unclear how they will be affected by quenching and in particular whether the expected benefit of cutting the low-@xmath186 peak in figs .",
    "[ fig : origin ] and [ fig : origin_lhc ] outweighs the disadvantage of potentially introducing extra sources of systematic uncertainty at moderate @xmath1 .",
    "one final comment is that experimental unfolding should provide enough information to produce origin plots like those shown here .",
    "as part of the broader discussion about fakes it would probably be instructive for such plots to be shown together with the inclusive - jet results .",
    "an example of an exclusive analysis might be a dijet study , in which one selects the two hardest jets in the event , with transverse momenta @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and plots the distribution of @xmath203 . here",
    "one can define `` fakes '' as corresponding to cases where one or other of the jets fails to match to one of the two hardest among all the jets from the individual @xmath5 events .",
    "this definition is insensitive to the soft / hard boundary in a simulation such as hydjet , because it naturally picks out hard @xmath5 jets that are far above that boundary .",
    "and , by concentrating on just two jets , it also evades the problem of high occupancy from the large multiplicity of semi - hard @xmath5 collisions .",
    "this simplification of the definition of fakes is common to many exclusive analyses , because they tend to share the feature of identifying just one or two hard reference jets .",
    "the specific case of the exclusive dijet analysis has the added advantage that it is amenable to a data - driven estimation of fakes .",
    "one divides the events into two groups , those for which the two hardest jets are on the same side ( in azimuth ) of the event and those in which they are on opposite sides ( a related analysis was presented by star in ref .  @xcite ) . for events in which one of the two jets is `` fake ,",
    "'' the two jets are just as likely to be on the same side as on the opposite side .",
    "this is not the case for non - fake jets , given that the two hardest `` true '' jets nearly always come from the same @xmath5 event and so have to be on opposite sides .",
    ", it is nearly always the case that the two hardest jets come from the same @xmath5 event . at the lhc , this happens above @xmath204 .",
    "] thus by counting the number of same - side versus opposite - side dijets in a given @xmath205 bin , one immediately has an estimate of the fake rate .",
    "events , if one has only limited rapidity acceptance then the same - side / opposite - side separation is not infrared safe , because of events in which only one hard jet is within the acceptance and the other `` jet '' is given by a soft gluon emission .",
    "thus to examine the same - side / opposite - side separation in plain @xmath5 events with limited acceptance , one would need to impose a @xmath1 cut on the second jet , say @xmath206 . ]",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dijets ] , which shows the distribution at rhic of the full , subtracted @xmath205 result , together with its separation into opposite - side and same - side components .",
    "one sees that in the peak region , the opposite and same - side distributions are very similar , indicating a predominantly `` fake '' origin for at least one of two hardest jets ( they are not quite identical , because there is less phase - space on the same side for a second jet than there is on the away side ) . however above a certain full , reconstructed @xmath205 value , about @xmath207 for anti-@xmath0 and @xmath208 for c / a(filt )",
    "the same - side distribution starts to fall far more rapidly than the opposite - side one , indicating that the measurement is now dominated by `` true '' pairs of jets .",
    "the lhc results , fig .",
    "[ fig : dijets_lhc ] , are qualitatively similar , with the same - side spectrum starting to fall off more steeply than the opposite - side one around @xmath209 for the anti-@xmath0 algorithm and @xmath210 for c / a(filt )",
    ".    one can also examine origin plots for @xmath211 , in analogy with the monte carlo analysis of section  [ sec : fakes : incl ] .",
    "for brevity , we refrain from showing them here , and restrict ourselves to the comment that in the region of @xmath211 where the result is dominated by opposite - side pairs , the origin plots are consistent with a purely hard origin for the dijets .",
    "in this article we have presented the results of a systematic study of heavy - ion jet reconstruction with jet - area based background subtraction , building on the brief initial proposal of @xcite .",
    "the questions we have examined include those of the choice of range for estimating the background , the choice of algorithm for the jet finding and the robustness of the reconstruction with respect to quenching effects and collision centrality .",
    "we have found that there is little difference between various ranges , as long as they are chosen to be localised to the vicinity of the jet of interest and of sufficient size ( at least 4 units of area for jets with @xmath11 ) . in comparing different algorithms we examined the systematic offset and the dispersion in the reconstructed jet @xmath1 .",
    "the offset can be brought close to zero by using the anti-@xmath0 algorithm , while the @xmath0 algorithm has the largest offset ; the cambridge / aachen ( c / a ) algorithm with filtering also gives a small offset , however this seems to have been due to a fortuitous cancellation between two only partially related effects .",
    "the dispersion is comparable for anti-@xmath0 , c / a and @xmath0 , but significantly smaller for c / a(filt ) ( except at high transverse momenta for lhc ) , as a consequence of its smaller jet area . among the different algorithms",
    ", anti-@xmath0 is the most robust with respect to quenching effects , and c / a(filt ) seems reasonably robust at rhic , though a little less so at the lhc .",
    "the precise numerical results for offset and dispersion can depend a little on the details of the simulation and the analysis , however the general pattern remains .",
    "overall our results indicate that the area - based subtraction method seems well suited for jet reconstruction in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "two jet - algorithm choices were found to perform particularly well : anti-@xmath0 , which has small offsets but larger fluctuations , and c / a with filtering , for which the offsets may be harder to control , but for which the fluctuations are significantly reduced , with consequent advantages for the unfolding of experimentally measured jet spectra .",
    "ultimately , we suspect that carrying out parallel analyses with these two choices may help maximise the reliability of jet results in hi collisions .",

    "in section [ sec : subtraction ] , we gave an estimate of the minimum size of a range one should require for determining @xmath8 , given a requirement that fluctuations in the determination of @xmath8 should be moderate .",
    "we give the details of the computation in this appendix .",
    "we start from the fact that the error made on the estimation of the background density @xmath8 will translate into an increase of the dispersion @xmath25 : on one hand , the dominant contribution to @xmath25 comes from the intra - event fluctuations of the background _ i.e._is of order @xmath212 with @xmath213 the jet area ; on the other hand , the dispersion @xmath214 of the misestimation of @xmath8 leads to an additional dispersion on the reconstructed jet @xmath1 of @xmath215 .",
    "adding these two sources of dispersion in quadrature and using the result from section  3.4 of @xcite , @xmath216 with @xmath217 the area of the range under consideration , we get @xmath218 if we ask _ e.g._that the contribution to the total dispersion coming from the misestimation of the background be no more than a fraction @xmath52 of the total @xmath25 , then we obtain the requirement @xmath219 for anti-@xmath0 jets of radius @xmath28 , with @xmath220 , this translates to @xmath221 where the numerical result has been given for @xmath55 . for @xmath11",
    ", it becomes @xmath222 .",
    "we can also cast this result in terms of the number of jets that must be present in @xmath37 . assuming that the jets used to estimate @xmath8 have a mean area of @xmath223 , or c / a algorithms for the background estimation  @xcite . ]",
    "we find a minimal number of jets , @xmath224 where , as before , we have taken @xmath225 .",
    "taking the numbers quoted above and @xmath65 , as used in the main body of the article , this gives @xmath226 .      from section  3.3 of @xcite",
    ", we know that the presence of hard jets and initial - state radiation leads to a bias in the extraction of @xmath8 of @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a numerical constant and @xmath229 is the average number of `` hard '' jets ( those above the scale of the background fluctuations , including initial - state radiation ) ; @xmath229 is given by @xmath230 where @xmath62 is the number of `` born '' partons from the underlying @xmath231 scattering that enter the region @xmath232 , while @xmath233 is the first coefficient of the qcd @xmath234-function . in the context of @xcite ,",
    "principally directed towards a study of the ue in @xmath5 collisions , @xmath69 was rather small , causing the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nhard ] ) , associated with initial - state radiation above a scale @xmath235 , to be comparable in size to the first term . in our case , @xmath69 is significantly larger and this reduces the impact of the second term sufficiently that we can ignore it .",
    "we thus arrive at the result @xmath236    note that the presence of hard jets and initial - state radiation also affects the fluctuations in the misestimation of @xmath8 and this should in principle have been included in the estimates of appendix  [ app : minrange - fluct ] .",
    "however , while the effect is not completely negligible , to within the accuracy that is relevant for us ( a few tens of percent in the estimation of a minimal @xmath217 ) it does not significantly alter the picture outlined there .",
    "we have seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : ptshift ] in section [ sec : choice_alg ] that the subtraction differs when we use the c / a algorithm with and without filtering .",
    "since this difference is not due to back - reaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ptshift_br ] ) , it has to be due to the subtraction itself .",
    "the difference comes from a bias introduced by the selection of the two hardest subjets during filtering .",
    "the dominant contribution comes when only one subjet , that we shall assume harder than all the others , contains the hard radiation , all the other subjets being pure background . in that case , the selection of the hardest of these pure - background subjets as the second subjet to be kept tends to pick positive fluctuations of the background .",
    "this in turn results in a positive offset compared to pure c / a clustering , as observed in section [ sec : choice_alg ] .    to compute the effect analytically ,",
    "let us thus assume that we have one hard subjet and @xmath237 pure - background subjets of area @xmath238  @xcite .",
    "after subtraction , the momentum of each of the pure - background subjet can be approximated as having a gaussian distribution of average zero and dispersion @xmath239 .",
    "assuming that the `` hard '' subjet s transverse momentum remains larger than that of all the background jets , the 2 subjets that will be kept by the filter are the hard subjet ( subtracted ) and the hardest of all the subtracted background jets .",
    "the momentum distribution of the latter is given by the maximum of the @xmath237 gaussian distributions .",
    "gaussian - distributed random numbers , but with the result replaced by zero if all of them are negative . in the calculations here",
    "we ignore this subtlety , since we will have @xmath240 and only @xmath241 of the time are three gaussian - distributed random numbers all negative . ]",
    "we are only interested here in computing the average bias introduced by the filtering procedure , which is then given by @xmath242 for the typical case @xmath122 and @xmath243 , one finds @xmath244 if we insert in that expression the typical values for the fluctuations quoted in section [ sec : results ] and @xmath11 , we find average biases of 2  gev for rhic and 4.5  gev at the lhc , which are in good agreement with the differences observed between c / a with and without filtering in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptshift ] .",
    "we stated , in section  [ sec : dispersion ] , that the increase of the dispersion at high @xmath1 seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : dispersion ] was mainly due to back - reaction .",
    "this is made explicit in fig .",
    "[ fig : br - v - full - dispersion ] , which decomposes the dispersion into its two components : that associated with the back - reaction , @xmath245 and that associated with background fluctuations and misestimation of @xmath8 ( defined as @xmath246^{\\frac12}$ ] ) .",
    "one sees that the background - fluctuation component is essentially independent of @xmath1 , while the back - reaction dispersion has a noticeable @xmath1 dependence .",
    "this is the case because the back - reaction dispersion is dominated by rare events in which two similarly hard subjets are separated by a distance close to @xmath28 ( specifically by @xmath247 with @xmath248 ) .",
    "in such a configuration , the background s contribution to the two subjets can affect whether they recombine and so lead to a large , @xmath249 , change to the jet s momentum . in the limit of a uniform background , @xmath250 , this can be shown to occur with a probability of order @xmath251 .",
    "thus the contribution to the average shift @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath252 ( which in a full analysis is found to be enhanced by a logarithm @xcite for the @xmath0 and c / a algorithms ) , while the contribution to @xmath253 goes as @xmath254 , and so leads to a dispersion that should grow asymptotically as @xmath255 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : br - v - full - dispersion ] is , however , probably not yet in the asymptotic regime ) .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that even though rare but large back - reaction dominates the overall dispersion , it will probably not be the main contributor in distorting the reconstructed jet spectrum .",
    "such distortions come from upwards @xmath26 fluctuations , whereas large back - reaction tends to be dominated by downwards fluctuations .",
    "the reason is simple : in order to have an upwards fluctuation from back - reaction , there must be extra @xmath1 near the jet in the original @xmath5 event .",
    "this implies the presence of a harder underlying @xmath231 scattering than would be deduced from the jet @xmath1 , with a corresponding significant price to pay in terms of more suppressed matrix elements and pdfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : br - v - full - dispersion ] also shows that the non - back - reaction component is nearly independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected since the anomalous dimension of the jet area is zero for anti-@xmath0 and small for c / a ( with or without filtering ) , and in any case leads to a weak scaling with @xmath1 , as @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , there is roughly a factor of @xmath125 between anti-@xmath0 and c / a(filt ) , as expected based on a proportionality of the dispersion to the square - root of the jet area .      one further source of @xmath26 fluctuations can come from imperfect estimation of the area of the jets .",
    "we recall that throughout this article we have used soft ghosts , each with area of @xmath256 , in order to establish the jet area .",
    "that implies a corresponding finite resolution on the jet area and related poor estimation of the exact edges of the jets , which can have an impact on the amount of background that one subtracts from each jet , and , consequently , on the final dispersion .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see , figure  [ fig : ghost - area - impact ] , that the dispersion @xmath25 is reduced by about @xmath126 if one lowers the ghost area to @xmath257 .    while this does nt affect any of the conclusions of our paper ,",
    "it does suggest that for a full experimental analysis there are benefits to be had from using a ghost area that is smaller than the default fastjet setting of @xmath256 .",
