    "the bacteria _ l. monocytogenes _ , _ s. flexneri _ , the spotted fever group of _ rickettsiae _ , and the _ vaccinia _ virus are intracellular pathogens that move through the continual polymerization of actin @xcite in distinctively curved `` comet - tails '' of actin filaments behind the motile particles .",
    "while fascinating on its own , the actin comet - tail is functionally similar to the actin mesh in the lamellipodia of a locomoting eukaryotic cell , and the bacterial surface is analogous to the leading edge of the cell .",

    "photobleaching experiments in _ l. monocytogenes _",
    "@xcite and qualitative observation of _ s. flexneri _ @xcite and of spotted - fever _ rickettsiae _ @xcite demonstrate that the tail is stationary with respect to the surrounding environment , probably due to steric or functional connections with the cellular cytoskeleton , so that the shape of the tail represents the path of the bacterium .",
    "the curvature of this path varies from bacterium to bacterium , and changes over time for individual bacteria .",
    "it is not known what determines the bacterial path , and hence the tail curvature , though no active control or chemotactic behavior has been proposed for these systems .",
    "bacteria are functioning micromachines , but can not be fully exploited without being fully understood .",
    "the _ l. monocytogenes _ motility system is well enough understood biochemically that acta coated microspheres @xcite should reconstitute polymerization - based motility in solutions of purified proteins @xcite , i.e. with total experimental control .",
    "however , we do not yet _ quantitatively _ understand the motility enough to be able to use the bacterial or microsphere motion as a probe of the bacterial or cellular conditions , or conversely to attempt to tailor those conditions to affect the bacterial motion .    in this paper , we propose that the curvature results from the random location of actin filaments pushing against the bacterium .",
    "we show how the curvature of the bacterial path can be used to predict static and dynamic structure at the bacterial surface .",
    "the average curvature is determined by the number of active filaments pushing the bacterium .",
    "information about filament lifetime and surface diffusion rates may be obtained from curvature autocorrelations , since curvature depends on the location of active filaments with respect to the bacterial surface . if filaments are closely localized to specific bacterial surface proteins , then lifetimes and diffusivities of those proteins can be inferred .",
    "we focus on the most common experimental geometry of a thin quasi - two - dimensional system constrained between a glass slide and cover - slip , however we also discuss what would be expected for bulk geometries .",
    "in both cases , we discuss the apparent curvature appropriate to video microscopy .",
    "curvature is defined as the rate of rotation of direction , @xmath0 , or the rotation per unit path length , where @xmath1 is the polar angle in the current plane of motion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] ) and @xmath2 is distance measured along the particle path .",
    "the radius of curvature , @xmath3 , equals the radius of the circle that locally best fits the path .",

    "the viscous drag force @xmath13 due to linear motion at speed @xmath14 also carries a factor of the viscosity , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] @xcite . since the curvature of the path , @xmath17 , we can use the drag coefficients to obtain a remarkably simple result , @xmath18 independent of the viscosity .",
    "this is fortunate since the effective viscosity of the cellular cytoplasm is strongly scale - dependent , ranging from @xmath19 poise ( @xmath20 ) for small loops on dye molecules @xcite to @xmath21 poise ( @xmath22 ) for @xmath23 diameter spheres @xcite .",
    "we find that the curvature directly probes the ratio of force and torque applied to the bacterium , with an easily determined geometrical prefactor .",
    "the force , @xmath24 , is proportional to the number of actively pushing filaments @xmath25 , while the force per filament @xmath26 depends on the specific details of the motility mechanism  as seen explicitly in thermal - ratchet models of polymerization - based motility @xcite . a complementary coarse - grained elastic analysis of polymerization - based bacterial motion @xcite exists",
    ", however it is not convenient for determining curvatures .",
    "we take @xmath26 as constant in time , which amounts to considering only times much greater than the mean - time between actin monomer addition or equivalently distances much greater than the monomer size @xmath27 .",
    "this is appropriate , since observed radii of curvature are larger than the bacterial scale ( which is @xmath28 microns ) .    to calculate the torque @xmath6",
    ", we must consider the torque due to each filament .",
    "these individual torques depend on exactly where the filament pushes on the bacterium .",
    "we assume that the @xmath25 actively pushing filaments are each randomly placed on the trailing end of the bacterium , so that each one will produce a random vectorial torque on the bacterium .",
    "the sum of many of these random torques will have a gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
    "we can calculate the root - mean - square ( rms ) torque , @xmath29 , from the local filament density .",
    "we take the growing filament barbed - ends as uniformly distributed over the hemispherical cap at the end of the bacterium . in cross - section , this leads to enhanced filament density at the edges of the tail , similar to that seen in thin - section electron micrographs of _ l. monocytogenes _ @xcite .",

    "[ eqn : rmsk ] though not the functional dependence on the number of filaments @xmath25 .",
    "remarkably , the average force per filament @xmath26 does not appear in our expression for the curvature , so that our results appear _ independent _ of the details of the force generation mechanism .",
    "however within polymerization ratchet models @xcite thermal fluctuations of semi - flexible actin filaments transverse to their length @xcite could generate transverse forces , which would lead to an increased torque and greater curvature than predicted a bove in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rmsk ] .",
    "this transverse contribution would depend on the biomechanics of the coupling between the actin filament and the bacterial surface , which would also depend on the bacterial shape .",
    "unfortunately it also depends on the effective and anisotropic elastic constants of the actin filaments @xcite , which in turn sensitively depends on how actively pushing actin filaments are cross - linked into the bacterial tail and the cytoskeleton  as can be seen by contrasting the elastic constants given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our simplified treatment corresponds to no coupling of forces transverse to the direction of bacterial motion .",
    "we hope that sensitive experiments can uncover the effects of these transverse forces and hence yield more insight into polymerization - based force generation , though we expect the effects to show up predominately in the geometrical prefactor or amplitude of the curvature in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rmsk ] and not in the @xmath43 dependence .",
    "we expect our subsequent analysis , on distributions and autocorrelations of the curvature , to be unaffected",
    ".    the vectorial torque perpendicular to the bacterial direction of motion is gaussian distributed , and the curvature is proportional to the _ magnitude _ of the torque . within a bulk ( @xmath44 ) geometry",

    "this intrinsic curvature is constant for fixed filament locations on the bacterial surface . at any given time",
    ", the intrinsic curvature represents circular motion around the curvature axis .",
    "however , the instantaneous curvature axis is not necessarily parallel to the line of sight , so the apparent path would appear elliptical and have a non - uniform curvature .",
    "we must also consider dynamical effects which change the direction of the curvature axis , both through rotation of the bacterium and through motion of the filaments on the bacterial surface .",
    "most experimental work to date has been done with restricted geometries , such as the typical gap of several microns @xcite between a glass slide and its cover slip .",
    "for thin enough samples , curvature out of the plane will be restricted .",
    "if the axial angle @xmath48 measures the angle between the vectorial torque and the normal to the sample plane in the line of sight , then the apparent curvature as measured from a microscope or video image will be @xmath49 positive and negative curvatures correspond to clockwise and counterclockwise curved paths in the microscope image , respectively .",

    "@xmath53 also follows directly from the gaussian distribution of each component of the torque .",

    "one must also specify the axial angle @xmath48 about the bacterial axis .",
    "if we line up the bacterium to travel away from us along the line of sight , before rotating it towards us by @xmath57 in the @xmath58 azimuthal direction , and measure @xmath48 as the angle between the vectorial torque and @xmath58 , then the apparent curvature is @xmath59 this is the curvature as measured from a microscope or video image , and takes values from @xmath60 with no explicit @xmath58 dependence .",
    "extremely large apparent curvatures are seen when bacteria are moving towards or away from the observer with correspondingly small velocities , with @xmath57 small .",
    "the apparent speed is @xmath61 , where @xmath14 is the bacterial speed along its path .",
    "a convenient quantity is obtained by `` normalizing '' the apparent curvature by multiplying by @xmath62 , to obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",

    "note that time or path - length weighted distributions will differ in bulk samples , since the apparent speed @xmath66 will vary dramatically even for a constant intrinsic bacterial speed .",
    "the distributions presented in this paper are for time - weighted sampling , appropriate for video microscopy and/or for planar ( @xmath67 ) geometries .",
    "for individual bacteria , the experimentally apparent variation of curvature from one moment to the next is striking @xcite . restricting ourselves to thin planar samples ,",
    "the angular diffusion of the bacterial orientation can lead to changing apparent curvatures through changing axial angles @xmath48 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : knormalize ] , and the _ intrinsic _ curvature can also vary if filament locations on the bacterial surface move significantly over time .",
    "we explore two cases , where active ( pushing ) filaments are removed and randomly replaced on the bacterial surface , and where active filament locations randomly diffuse .",
    "we will later apply these cases to characterize filament repositioning for different motile systems .",
    "it is easiest to characterize changes in the net torque acting on the bacterium with respect to a reference frame fixed to the bacterium .",

    "solutions of diffusion on a spherical surface of radius @xmath11 @xcite leads to @xmath75 .",
    "these results would apply directly to proteolysis / replacement or surface motion of bacterial proteins such as acta or icsa if active filament positions are localized to such bacterial surface features ( see below ) .",
    "they should also apply to dynamics intrinsic to the actin tail through capping and nucleation of active actin filaments @xcite , where capping is a loss mechanism . in this case ,",
    "the timescale of of autocorrelation decay would depend on the details of filament nucleation  how new filaments are placed with respect to pre - existing active filaments .",
    "azimuthal diffusion will not affect the intrinsic curvature or its correlations , but it can contribute to decay of correlations of the _ apparent _ curvature by changing the apparent curvature over time .",
    "azimuthal diffusion obeys @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the net angle of rotation in the time @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the diffusion constant .",

    "there are three .",
    "_ first _ , the relation between curvature and number of filaments in the actin tail , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rmsk ] , can be compared with electron - microscopy cross - sections and with normalized fluorescence studies .",
    "the relation between curvature and particle size , also in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rmsk ] , can be used for different sized particles with similar surface preparations , such as microspheres .",
    "_ second _ , the distribution of observed curvatures is predicted to be gaussian , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ensemble ] . for particles with constant intrinsic curvatures a qualitatively distinct distribution of apparent curvatures , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : apparent ] , is expected .",
    "if three - dimensional tracking of particles in a thick sample is used , then the intrinsic distribution would apply , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : intrinsic ] .",
    "_ third _ , the variation of curvature in time is predicted to be described by an exponentially decaying autocorrelation function , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : apparentcorr ] .",
    "the timescale of autocorrelation decay , @xmath72 , characterizes how the position of active filaments in the bacterial tail change .",
    "studies of different size particles , or direct tracking of azimuthal particle rotation , could help to untangle the possible contributions to curvature autocorrelation decay .",
    "we have made simplifying assumptions to facilitate our analysis .",
    "we have assumed particular particle shapes and surface distributions of filaments .",
    "we also took the individual filament forces @xmath26 to be in the direction of particle travel .",
    "different shapes , surface distributions , and filament orientations would change the numerical prefactor in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rmsk ] , though the curvature distributions would not be affected .",
    "we have also assumed that individual filaments are _ independently _ randomly located .",
    "non - random symmetric filament locations will result in curvatures much _ less _ than predicted in this paper .",
    "in contrast filament distributions that not symmetric will lead to qualitatively larger curvature than discussed here , where we assume a random but azimuthally symmetric distribution .",
    "we have also assumed that the viscosity does not vary strongly over bacterial length - scales .",
    "strong viscous heterogeneities , perhaps caused by particle motion itself , as well as local constraints posed by cellular organelles and membranes , will affect particle trajectories .",
    "this could dominate the effects described here _ in vivo_.    this work was supported financially by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , _ le fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche du qubec _ , and by the canadian institute of advanced research program in the science of soft surfaces and interfaces .",
    "we would like to thank lisa cameron , julie theriot , and bob heinzen for discussions , and sarah keller and jennifer robbins for critical readings of earlier versions of the manuscript .",
