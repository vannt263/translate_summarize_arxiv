    "strongly coupled plasmas in nature include neutron star crusts  @xcite , giant planet interiors , and white dwarf interiors  @xcite .",
    "strongly coupled plasma can be realized in the laboratory using a dusty plasma , which is a four - component mixture of electrons , ions , neutral gas , and micron - size particles of solid matter  @xcite .",
    "the solid particles , which we call dust particles , become strongly coupled due to their large charges .",
    "we investigate a system that hinders a projectile s motion by two types of collisions : coulomb collisions among strongly coupled dust particles , and the friction due to collisions of gas atoms with the projectile .",
    "the latter is modeled as a simple drag term , which does not require a particle description of the gas atoms .",
    "the gas friction has been reviewed in  @xcite , and binary coulomb collisions for an _",
    "isolated pair _ of dust particles are reviewed in  @xcite . in a strongly coupled plasma ,",
    "coulomb collisions are different from collisions of an isolated pair ( i.e. , binary ) because the target particle in a strongly coupled plasma does not move freely as it recoils .",
    "instead it collides immediately with other target particles , which collide with others in a chain of collisions . in this way , the coulomb collisional process is collective and not binary  @xcite . to simulate this system ,",
    "we require a model that represents dust particles as discrete particles .",
    "since the collisions are so different in weakly and strongly coupled plasmas , one would expect transport coefficients , such as mobility , to be different as well .",
    "the velocity relaxation rate , which is related to the mobility , has been studied in ultracold plasmas with an ionic coulomb coupling parameter @xmath9 of order unity  @xcite .",
    "the mobility and drift motion have also been studied in several two - dimensional strongly coupled coulomb systems , which are not plasmas but have similar coulomb collisions ; these include colloidal crystals  @xcite , and electrons  @xcite and ions  @xcite on the surface of liquid helium . to the best of our knowledge",

    "other transport processes including diffusion  @xcite , viscosity  @xcite , and thermal conductivity  @xcite have been studied for dusty plasmas .",
    "we expect mobility in a dusty plasma to be determined by two effects experienced by the dust particles : coulomb collisions ( which in dusty plasmas are modeled by a yukawa potential ) and frictional drag on the ambient neutral gas .",
    "the conditions we investigate are at a moderate value of @xmath9 where the strongly coupled plasma is in a dense liquid - like state .",
    "there are at least two regimes of projectile transport , depending on the driving force @xmath0 . in what we term the _ low regime _ , @xmath0 is small so that projectiles are near thermal equilibrium with target particles . in what we term the _ high regime _ , @xmath0 is so large as to cause a considerable departure from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the literature for ions in gases is well developed , and many experiments have been reported  .",
    "it is known for that system that the transport in the high regime is different from the low regime : the mobility is not constant but varies with @xmath0 in a way that depends on the scattering potential  @xcite .    for the denser physical system of liquids instead of gases , while it is possible to propel a small projectile , the target s high density poses a great difficulty for attaining a superthermal speed for the projectile .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to perform experiments to study mobility in a liquid in a high regime .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by using a dusty plasma as a model system for a liquid because a dusty plasma has a small volume fraction  @xcite .",

    "a projectile drifts through a target due to a net force @xmath0 ; this net force could be due to an imbalance of electric and ion drag forces , as can happen for different dust particle sizes .",
    "due to their different sizes , a projectile particle drifts , while the target particles are in a force equilibrium and do not drift .",
