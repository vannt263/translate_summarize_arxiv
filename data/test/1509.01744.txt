    "interactions between neutral dielectric bodies are traditionally viewed as being due predominantly to electromagnetic field fluctuations , or equivalently , dipole fluctuations that give rise to van der waals ( vdw ) fluctuation - induced interactions between them @xcite .",
    "these interactions are attractive between identical bodies in vacuum or in a polarizable medium , such as water or an aqueous electrolyte ( or coulomb fluid ) .",
    "they contribute one of the two key ingredients of the classical derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory of colloidal stability , the other one being the mean - field electrostatic interaction , which is repulsive for like - charged colloidal surfaces @xcite .",
    "recent works have , however , highlighted the role of image - induced , ion - depletion effects in this scenario ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , leading to depletion of mobile solution ions from the vicinity of dielectric interfaces and , therefore , to an additional attractive force between apposed dielectric boundaries .",
    "this is because most dielectric surfaces in the context of bio- and soft materials have a lower ( static ) dielectric constant than that of water and , therefore , solution ions experience repulsion from their same - sign image charges in the proximity of dielectric boundaries @xcite .",
    "the recent advances in the study of image - induced , ion - depletion effects follow on the trail of the onsager - samaras framework formulated originally in the context of the surface tension problem of electrolytes @xcite",
    ". such non - mean - field effects , which belong to the general class of depletion interactions @xcite , arise due to the discrete nature of mobile ions neglected in the collective mean - field description based on the standard poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite .",
    "the studies of image - induced , ion - depletion effects have been focused exclusively on the case of strictly neutral ( charge - free ) dielectric surfaces . in this case , the ion - depletion interactions can be amplified in the presence of mobile multivalent ions in the solution @xcite due to stronger ion - image repulsions for these ions , even when the multivalent ions are present at small bulk concentrations around just a few mm @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of interaction between neutral dielectric surfaces in a coulomb fluid by adding to it a novel feature : we relax the constraint of _ strict _ electroneutrality of surface boundaries , considered so far in the literature , by assuming that the surfaces are neutral only _ on the average _ , while microscopically they carry a _ quenched _ ( fixed ) random distribution of positive and negative charges .",
    "we show that this seemingly simple generalization leads to significant qualitative changes in the distribution of ions and , consequently , also in the effective interactions between dielectric surfaces , especially when the intervening coulomb fluid contains mobile multivalent ions .",
    "disordered charged systems are abundant in soft matter with examples ranging from polycrystalline surfaces with patchy surface potentials @xcite , dielectric contact surfaces @xcite , vapor - deposited amorphous films on solid substrates @xcite , surfactant - coated surfaces @xcite , dna microarrays @xcite , intrinsically disordered proteins @xcite , patchy colloids @xcite and random polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes @xcite .",
    "surface charge disorder in these examples can exhibit highly random distributions as well as patchy and heterogeneous patterns , originating from different sources including specific electronic and/or structural properties of materials involved , surface grafting or adsorption of charged molecules and/or contaminants , synthetic and fabrication processes , etc",
    ". the surface charge disorder can be highly sample specific and , at the same time , can depend strongly on the method of preparation .",
    "it may be set and quenched for each sample ( which is the case of interest in this paper ) , annealed ( in which case the surface charges are mobile and in thermal equilibrium with the rest of the system ) , or partially quenched or partially annealed @xcite .",
    "motivated by these examples , study of charge disorder and , in particular , effective interactions between random charge distributions has witnessed growing attention from theoreticians over the last several years @xcite , as well as from the simulation side where initial steps have been taken to include the effects of charge heterogeneity and disorder @xcite .",
    "disorder effects have been studied extensively in the context of electromagnetic fluctuation - induced interactions between two apposed , randomly charged surfaces in vacuum @xcite , where they have been associated with anomalously long - ranged surface interactions observed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "they have also been studied in situations where a weakly coupled coulomb fluid , containing , e.g. , monovalent cation and anions , intervenes between the bounding surfaces @xcite .",
    "this however leaves out the case of asymmetric coulomb fluids containing both monovalent ions and multivalent ( counter- ) ions .",
    "these kinds of systems are in fact quite common in experiments within the biological context as in the case of viruses , dna condensates or other charged biopolymer aggregates @xcite and are expected to behave very differently since multivalent ions are known to couple strongly with fixed surface charges .",
    "strong - coupling behavior of multivalent counterions at uniformly charged surfaces or surfaces with regular charge patterns has been studied extensively over the last decade and its connection to exotic phenomena such as like - charged attraction has been throughly discussed ( for recent reviews and a more exhaustive list of references , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in disordered charged systems ,",
    "such strong - coupling phenomena have been considered only in a few cases so far @xcite by assuming that bounding surfaces carry a _",
    "finite _ mean surface charge density , to which multivalent counterions can couple strongly , in the same sense as considered in the context of uniformly charged surfaces as noted above .",
    "yet , the presence of charge randomness on bounding surfaces was shown to give rise to novel phenomena such as strong surface attraction of multivalent counterions , characterized by a density profile that diverges at the surface , in clear violation of the contact - value theorem established for uniformly charged surfaces .",
    "this kind of behavior originates from a singular , attractive , single - ion potential , which is created by the randomness in the distribution of surface charges and , as such , depends on the surface charge variance .",
    "consequently , one can also show that the thermal entropy of counterions is diminished upon introducing a finite degree of charge randomness on the boundaries .",
    "in other words , the system becomes more ` ordered ' as a direct outcome of the interplay between the thermal entropy of ions and the configurational entropy of charge randomness , entering through an ensemble average over various realizations of the disordered charge distribution .",
    "this peculiar disorder - induced effect , which stands at odds with what one may expect intuitively , has been referred to as _ antifragility _",
    "@xcite .",
    "our analysis in this paper is focused on yet another facet of the disorder - induced effects by assuming , in a system of two plane - parallel dielectric slabs , that the randomly charged surfaces of the slabs bear _ no net charge_. this eliminates the direct strong coupling between multivalent ions and the mean surface charge and , thereby , also the ensuing strong - coupling interactions , considered in our previous papers @xcite , that would otherwise completely mask the vdw and image - induced , ion - depletion interactions between the slabs in an asymmetric coulomb fluid .",
    "this allows us to address the question of how the presence of surface charge disorder affects the standard picture for the interaction of neutral bodies based on the vdw and ion - depletion effects .",
    "the surface charge disorder has several different implications : first , it contributes a _ repulsive _ interaction between the slabs , which comes from self - interactions of disorder charges on the bounding surfaces with their image charges ; this contribution counteracts the _ attractive _ vdw interaction as discussed thoroughly elsewhere @xcite .",
    "then , as noted above , the individual ions in the coulomb fluid experience an attractive disorder - induced potential , which strongly attracts them toward the bounding surfaces .",
    "this effect counteracts the ion - image repulsions that tend to deplete ions from the slit region between the slabs and form the basis of the image - induced , ion - depletion mechanism for attraction between strictly neutral slabs .",
    "thus , randomly charged bounding surfaces tend to accumulate more mono- and multivalent ions in the slit .",
    "the system , however , responds differently to the increased number of ions : while the osmotic pressure due to monovalent ions increases and even becomes _ repulsive _ , consistent with the standard mean - field picture , the osmotic pressure due to multivalent ions , becomes ever more _ attractive _ !",
    "this behavior is rooted in the combined effect of the surface charge disorder and the presence of mobile multivalent ions , with the latter creating strong inter - surface attractions upon further accumulation in the slit . as a result",
    ", the effective total interaction pressure between randomly charged , net - neutral dielectric surfaces can differ qualitatively from what one expects based on the standard vdw @xcite and image - induced , ion - depletion interactions in the case of strictly neutral surfaces ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the net effect due to the interplay between disorder , mono- and multivalent - ion contributions yields a qualitatively different behavior for the effective surface - surface interactions , depending on the strength of disorder as quantified by the _ disorder coupling ( or strength ) parameter _ @xcite .",
    "this feature bears some conceptual resemblance to the strong - weak coupling dichotomy that exists for net - charged surfaces , dependent on the _ electrostatic coupling parameter _ in that case @xcite . in weakly disordered systems , corresponding to a small disorder coupling parameter , one then discerns a distinct non - monotonic behavior for the interaction pressure as a function of the separation between the slabs , with a pronounced repulsive hump at intermediate separations ; conversely , in strongly disordered systems , corresponding to a large disorder coupling parameter , the effective interaction pressure becomes strongly attractive , with a range and magnitude larger than that of the vdw or the image - induced , ion - depletion interaction pressure as found between strictly neutral surfaces .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce our model and , in section [ sec : general ] , we briefly discuss the theoretical background and present the general results for the two - slab system .",
    "the results of our analysis for the density profile of multivalent ions and the effective interactions between the slabs are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude our discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .     and randomly charged inner surfaces are immersed in a bathing ionic solution of dielectric constant @xmath0 .",
    "the solution contains a mixture of monovalent and multivalent salts .",
    "multivalent ions are confined in the slit region and are shown by large spheres ; monovalent salt anions and cations are shown by small red and blue spheres .",
    "the slabs are assumed to be neutral on the average and their thickness is taken to be infinite.,width=321 ]",
    "our model consists of two plane - parallel dielectric slabs of infinite surface area @xmath1 and dielectric constant @xmath2 with inner surfaces placed perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis at a separation distance of @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : schematic ] ) .",
    "the slabs are immersed in an asymmetric coulomb fluid of dielectric constant @xmath0 at room temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the coulomb fluid is a mixture of a monovalent @xmath6 salt of bulk ( reservoir ) concentration @xmath7 and a multivalent @xmath8 salt of bulk concentration @xmath9 with multivalent ions having charge valency of @xmath10 .",
    "the multivalent ions are confined within the slit region @xmath11 , while the monovalent ions are dispersed throughout the space except in the region occupied by the dielectric slabs that are assumed to be impermeable to mobile ions @xcite .",
    "we are interested only in the cases where the slab thickness is much larger than the debye ( or salt ) screening length and , thus , in the calculations to be presented later , we shall assume that the slab thickness is infinite .",
    "the inner surfaces of the slabs are assumed to bear a _ quenched _ , random charge distribution @xmath12 , while they remain electrically _ net - neutral_. we assume that the random surface charges are distributed according to a gaussian probability distribution function , which is determined fully by its two moments , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 , \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the surface disorder variance . by assumption , thus , the disordered charge distributions on the two slabs are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "the effects of surface charge correlations ( or  patchiness \" ) and the internal structure of multivalent ions , which are assumed to be point - like here , will be considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in the present model , we have two types of mobile ions , namely , mono- and multivalent ions , that are expected to behave very differently in the presence of dielectric boundaries . on general grounds , and if the surfaces are assumed to be strictly neutral ( charge free ) , mobile ions interact only with their image charges .",
    "this interaction scales with the second power of the ionic valency , being thus much larger in the case of multivalent ions with @xmath17 ( e.g. , trivalent and tetravalent ions ) . in this latter case ,",
    "the ion - image interactions are dominated by the self - image interaction .",
    "note that in most realistic examples , ions are dissolved in water , which is a highly polarizable medium with @xmath18 at room temperature ( @xmath19  k ) and , thus , we often have @xmath20 , giving image charges of the same sign and , hence , repulsive self - image interactions for each ion in the slit . such repulsive interactions lead to statistical correlations ( manifested as ion depletion ) between the mobile ions and the bounding surfaces that are expected to be weak for monovalent ions , but quite strong for multivalent ions .",
    "this leads to a complicated problem in which different ionic species show distinctly different couplings to local electrostatic fields generated by the boundaries . while the monovalent ions can be therefore described appropriately by mean - field - type theories , such as the poisson - boltzmann or the debye - hckel theory @xcite , the multivalent ions require an altogether different description that should account for such large correlation effects .",
    "the situation is , therefore , analogous to the one found in the case of asymmetric coulomb fluids confined between _ charged _ surfaces , where the dominant factor determining the behavior of multivalent counterions is again their electrostatic coupling to the local fields that are generated by the boundaries .",
    "the difference is however that in the the case of a charged surface the coupling is determined by the so - called electrostatic coupling parameter @xcite , depending on the charge density of the surface boundaries , enabling the so - called _ strong - coupling approximation _ for multivalent counterions at charged surfaces ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) , or more generally , the _ dressed multivalent - ion theory _",
    "@xcite , which provides a very good approximation for the study of asymmetric coulomb fluids over a wide range of parameters as verified by explicit - ion and implicit - ion simulations .",
    "the dressed multivalent - ion theory reproduces the mean - field debye - hckel theory and the standard strong - coupling theory for counterion - only systems @xcite as two limiting theories in the regime of large and small debye screening lengths and , therefore , bridges the gap between these two limits @xcite .",
    "the key step in this latter approach is to integrate out the degrees of freedom associated with monovalent ions by means of a linearization approximation , justified only for highly asymmetric coulomb fluids @xmath17 , and yielding an effective debye - hckel ( dh ) interaction between the remaining multivalent ions and the surface charges ( if any ) @xcite .",
    "then , one expands the partition function of the system in terms of the fugacity ( or bulk concentration , @xmath21 ) of multivalent ions or in terms of the inverse electrostatic coupling parameter for counterion - only systems @xcite .",
    "the leading order of the virial expansion can be cast into a simple analytic theory because of its single - particle structure , which can successfully describe various features of strongly charged systems containing multivalent ions ( see , e.g. refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the regime of applicability of this theory has been discussed extensively in recent literature @xcite , which we therefore do not reiterate here .    in the case of",
    "strictly neutral ( charge - free ) surfaces , this strategy was shown to be effective as well @xcite , since , as is often the case in experimental systems containing asymmetric ionic mixtures @xcite , multivalent counterions of high valency ( for instance , cohex@xmath22 or polyamines such as spd@xmath22 , sp@xmath23 ) are present only in small bulk concentrations , of about a few mm , justifying fully the virial expansion scheme that underlies the dressed multivalent - ion theory .",
    "this is the approach of choice that we adopt also in the present context , where the surface boundaries carry random charges and are neutral only on the average .",
    "the only additional step here is that , due to the quenched disorder in the surface charge distribution , the free energy of the system follows by averaging over the whole ensemble of charge distributions , @xmath12 @xcite .      without delving further into details available in previous publications @xcite ,",
    "we proceed by giving the general expression for the free energy of the two - slab system considered in this work , which has the form @xcite",

    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq : exact_gpot ] ) represents the free energy of the system in the absence of multivalent ions .",

    "as seen , for strictly neutral ( or disorder - free ) dielectrics , the density profile ( black solid curve ) shows a partial depletion of multivalent ions from the vicinity of the surface boundaries .",
    "this is caused by the salt - image repulsion ( corresponding to the first term in eq .",

    "in fact , the resulting disorder potential acting on individual multivalent ions ( corresponding to the second term in eq .",

    "in this work , we have studied the effective interactions between _ net - neutral _ dielectric slabs that carry _ quenched _ ( fixed ) random charge distributions on their apposing surfaces while they are immersed in an asymmetric aqueous electrolyte ( coulomb fluid ) containing mobile monovalent and multivalent ions .",
    "the effective interaction between quenched , random charge distributions have been considered in a series of recent works @xcite , and , while the role of debye screening due to a weakly coupled ( monovalent ) salt solution on these interactions have been analyzed , the role of multivalent ions that couple strongly with surface charges has received much less attention @xcite .    the interaction between ( electro- ) neutral dielectric slabs is traditionally described in terms of vdw or casimir - type forces @xcite that are always attractive between identical bodies in vacuum or in a polarizable medium such as water or an aqueous salt solution . in the dlvo context @xcite , the vdw attraction is counteracted by the mean - field electrostatic repulsion between like - charged surfaces , providing thus a mechanism for the stability of colloidal dispersions . in the case of strictly neutral surfaces , however , the electrostatic inter - surface repulsion is obviously absent but , in addition to the vdw interaction , there are image - induced , ion - depletion forces that are attractive as well and arise because the mobile solution ions are depleted from the vicinity of the dielectric interfaces as a consequence of the repulsion from their image charges ( these image charges are of the same sign when the surfaces are immersed in a medium of larger dielectric constant as compared with that of the slabs ) .",
    "this effect is intrinsically non - mean - field and occurs because of the discrete nature of ions , neglected in the collective mean - field description based on the standard poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite .",
    "image - induced , ion - depletion effects for strictly neutral dielectric surfaces have been studied extensively in recent years ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) and",
    "the role of multivalent ions , in particular , has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we add a new feature to the current understanding of the effective interaction between neutral surfaces and consider the situation , in which the surfaces are neutral only _ on the average _ but otherwise carry a quenched random distribution of positive and negative charges .",
    "indeed , heterogeneously or randomly charged surfaces are commonplace in soft matter and have attracted a lot of attention in recent years ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we have thus shown that the presence of _ quenched surface charge disorder _ in conjunction with _",
    "mobile multivalent ions _ in the ionic solution leads to remarkable and significant qualitative changes in the standard picture commonly accepted for the interaction between neutral bodies .",
    "the charge disorder has several manifestations in the present context : first , the self - interactions between the quenched random charges on the inner surfaces of the dielectric slabs and their image charges lead to a repulsive , short - ranged interaction pressure , @xmath91 , that tends to counteract the attractive vdw interaction pressure , @xmath96 as discussed thoroughly elsewhere @xcite . the surface charge disorder , on the other hand , modifies the single - ion interaction potentials in a way that creates a singular attractive potential acting between ions and the dielectric boundaries @xcite .",
    "this effect works against the ion - image repulsions that tend to deplete ions from the slit region between the slabs .",
    "thus , as a result of this attractive disorder - induced potential , more mono- and multivalent ions are accumulated in the slit when the confining dielectric boundaries are randomly charged .",
    "however , we find qualitative differences in the ways this excess attraction affects the osmotic pressure of ions .",
    "the osmotic pressure due to monovalent ions , @xmath93 , can become _ repulsive _ which , in fact , agrees with the standard mean - field picture since monovalent ions are only weakly coupled to the bounding surfaces and create a larger entropic pressure upon further accumulation in the slit . on the other hand ,",
    "the osmotic pressure due to multivalent ions , @xmath92 , can become even more _ attractive _ !",
    "this is in clear contrast with the image - induced , ion - depletion mechanism , in which a _ decrease _ in the number of mono- and multivalent ions in the slit gives rise to ( stronger ) attractive osmotic pressures on the slabs , similarly for both types of ions .",
    "this rich behavior stems from combined effects of surface charge disorder and the presence of mobile multivalent ions , with the latter creating strong inter - surface attractions upon further accumulation in the slit . as a result , the effective total interaction pressure between randomly charged , net - neutral dielectric surfaces can differ qualitatively from what one expects based on the standard vdw and/or image - induced , ion - depletion interactions for strictly neutral surfaces , where they predict purely attractive interactions ( unless at relatively large bulk salt concentrations , e.g. , above 250 mm , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , the net effect from the competing electrostatic components due to disorder , mono- and multivalent ions results in a distinct , disorder - induced _ non - monotonic _ behavior .    in the _ weak disorder regime _ , the net electrostatic pressure becomes gradually more repulsive ( positive ) at intermediate to large separations as the disorder coupling parameter ( or equivalently the disorder variance , @xmath30 ) on the bounding surfaces of the slabs is increased from zero ( strictly neutral or disorder - free system ) , exhibiting first a shallow minimum and then a pronounced repulsive hump at intermediate separations . as the disorder coupling parameter is further increased into the _ strong disorder regime _",
    "( typically beyond @xmath129 ) , the behavior of the net electrostatic pressure is reversed ; the repulsive hump is diminished and one finds a strongly attractive ( negative ) interaction pressure with a range and magnitude larger than that of the vdw or the image - induced , ion - depletion interaction pressures between strictly neutral surfaces .",
    "the crossover from weak to strong disorder regimes can be effected also by decreasing the salt screening parameter ( through decreasing the bulk concentration of monovalent ions ) and/or increasing the bulk concentration of multivalent ions .",
    "the two different regimes of the disorder effects , the strong and the weak disorder regimes , bear also some resemblance to the strong - weak coupling dichotomy that exists for the net - charged surfaces , dependent on the electrostatic coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "it is no small feat to be able to partition the behavior of this complicated system by two dimensionless coupling parameters that effectively govern its salient characteristics .",
    "finally , we note the qualitative differences between the ion - mediated interactions we find between net - neutral surfaces in this work and those we reported between randomly charged surfaces carrying a finite mean surface charge density , @xmath130 , in refs .",
    "one of the key differences is that the repulsion between mean surface charges on the inner surfaces of the slabs , @xmath131 , in the latter case contributes a dominant repulsive pressure to the net electrostatic pressure , which is stronger , both in magnitude and range , than @xmath91 and @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the surfaces carry a finite mean surface charge density , the osmotic pressure of monovalent ions , @xmath93 , turns out to be always repulsive and comparable in magnitude and range to @xmath131 ; these repulsive pressure components completely mask the short - range interaction pressures , @xmath91 and @xmath96 , whose roles in competition with the attractive pressure due to multivalent ions , @xmath92 , are brought up only in the case of net - neutral surfaces .",
    "notably , we find that @xmath93 in the case of surfaces carrying a finite mean surface charge density hardly responds to changes in the disorder strength , while , in the case of net - neutral surfaces , it can change from a purely attractive component ( due to image - induced , ion - depletion effects ) for disorder - free and weakly disordered surfaces to a repulsive one ( due to disorder - driven ion accumulation in the slit ) for strongly disordered surfaces .",
    "another difference between the two cases is that multivalent ( counter- ) ions in the case of surfaces carrying a finite mean surface charge density correlate strongly also with the mean charge densities of the confining boundaries of the slit , in line with the strong - coupling paradigm for electrostatics of charged surfaces known to generate strong like - charged surface attractions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "such strong - coupling effects are clearly absent in the present case with net - neutral surfaces .    in summary ,",
    "our analysis provides new insight into the intricate role of surface charge disorder in the context of net - neutral surfaces and its fingerprints on the effective ion - mediated interactions between them .",
    "these interactions are predicted to occur with a range and magnitude comparable to or , for strongly disordered systems , much larger than the vdw and/or image - induced , ion - depletion effects considered previously only in the case of strictly neutral surfaces .",
