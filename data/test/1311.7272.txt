    "quantum tensor networks are a competitive tool to study strongly correlated quantum systems on a lattice .",
    "their history begins with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite - an algorithm to minimize the energy of a matrix product state ( mps ) ansatz in one dimension ( 1d ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of mps algorithms . in the last decade",
    "mps was generalized to a 2d `` tensor product state '' widely known as a projected entangled pair state ( peps ) @xcite .",
    "another type of tensor network is the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite , and the branching mera @xcite , that is a refined version of the real space renormalization group .",
    "being variational methods , the quantum tensor networks do not suffer form the notorious fermionic sign problem , and thus they can be applied to strongly correlated fermions in 2d @xcite .",
    "a possible breakthrough in this direction was an application of the peps ansatz to the t - j model @xcite , which is a strong coupling approximation to the celebrated hubbard hamiltonian of the high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "an energy of the ground state was obtained that could compete with the best variational monte - carlo results @xcite .",
    "the tensor networks also proved to be a powerful tool to study topological spin liquids ( tsl ) .",
    "the search for realistic models gained momentum after white demonstrated the spin - liquid nature of the kagome antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained by a _ tour de force _ application of a quasi-1d dmrg .",
    "the dmrg investigation of tsl s was elevated to a higher degree of sophistication in ref .",
    "unfortunately , the mps tensor network underlying the dmrg suffers from severe limitations in two dimensions , where it can be used for states with a very short correlation length only .",
    "in contrast , the peps ansatz in fig .",
    "[ figpeps ] is not restricted in this way .",
    "its usefulness for tsl has already been demonstrated . in ref . @xcite it was shown how to represent the rvb state with the peps ansatz in an efficient way . in ref .",
    "@xcite peps was used to classify topologically distinct ground states of the kagome antiferromagnet . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite peps demonstrated a tsl in the antiferromagnetic @xmath1 model .",
    "in contrast to the ground state , finite temperature states have been explored so far mostly with the mps @xcite . in a way that can be easily generalized to 2d",
    ", the mps is extended to finite temperature by appending each lattice site with an ancilla @xcite .",
    "a thermal state is obtained by an imaginary time evolution of a pure state in the enlarged hilbert space starting from infinite temperature . however , the thermal states are of more interest in 2d , where they can undergo finite temperature phase transformations . a thermal peps with ancillas was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a finite temperature phase diagram of the 2d quantum ising model in a transverse field was obtained .",
    "this approach is further developed in this paper to a fermionic thermal peps , with a benchmark application to a 2d spinless hubbard model .",
    "before we proceed , let us note that the peps with ancillas is not the only way to attack the strongly correlated thermal states .",
    "a very interesting alternative was developed in a series of papers @xcite where , instead of the imaginary time evolution , a tensor network representing the partition function is contracted by subsequent tensor renormalizations in the imaginary time and space dimensions .",
    "yet another interesting alternative , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on linear optimization of local density matrices at finite @xmath2 . finally , alternative representations for fermionic states are also developed @xcite .",

    "the following section [ suzuki ] introduces the imaginary time evolution operator , its second order suzuki - trotter decomposition for the spinless hubbard model , and their diagrammatic representation in terms of the tensor network .",
    "the peps tensors require renormalization / truncation of their bond indices after every suzuki - trotter gate . the renormalization procedure is described in section [ renormalization ] , where it is illustrated with a series of diagrams .",
