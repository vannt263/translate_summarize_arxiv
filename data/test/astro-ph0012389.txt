    "unlike the milky way , the magellanic clouds contain a population of young ( 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 yr ) rich star clusters , sometimes called populous clusters .",
    "these clusters have been popular targets for studies of stellar evolution and cluster formation . with hst ,",
    "deep colour - magnitude diagrams can be produced , even of the dense central regions of the clusters .",
    "of particular interest is whether these clusters show an age spread amongst the massive stars , providing evidence for the currently unknown duration of cluster formation .",
    "an age spread amongst the turn - off stars would appear as a spread in colour larger than the measured errors .",
    "the age spread in some clusters , e.g. trapezium @xcite , ngc6531 @xcite , is small , only a few dynamical times .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the star formation timescale is of this order on all spatial scales . on the other hand",
    "some clusters show evidence for larger age spreads , e.g. ngc1805 @xcite , and longer star formation timescales are required in some models of the initial mass function based on clump or protostar interactions .",
    "the timescale for cluster formation has implications for the efficiency of star formation .",
    "if the star formation timescale is short ( @xmath6 the dynamical time ) then , for the cluster to remain bound , the efficiency must be high .",
    "if the star formation timescale is longer then the efficiency can be lower , as gas can be removed without disrupting the cluster @xcite .",
    "the search for age spreads is complicated by the presence in the clusters of be stars and blue stragglers .",
    "the be and blue straggler populations are also interesting to study in their own right , especially because the factors affecting the numbers of blue stragglers and be stars are not well understood .",
    "the unique young , metal - poor and rich environment of the young magellanic clusters therefore provides a useful addition to the parameter space studied .",
    "blue stragglers are stars that are bluer and brighter than the main sequence turn - off .",
    "they are thought to be produced by the merger of two normal cluster stars , either in a primordial binary system , or through direct stellar collisions , or both .",
    "all galactic globular clusters that have been surveyed contain some blue stragglers , though the fraction of blue stragglers varies greatly , even between similar clusters .",
    "some galactic open clusters also contain blue stragglers .",
    "blue stragglers are found in open clusters of all ages @xcite . in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "blue straggler stars have been found in old ( ngc121 @xcite , ngc1466 & ngc2257 @xcite ) and young ( ngc330 @xcite ) clusters .",
    "be stars are non - supergiant ( luminosity class v to iii ) b type stars that show or once have shown balmer emission @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the be phenomenon is associated with rapid rotation of the stellar photosphere , and the presence of a circumstellar disk that gives rise to the line emission .",
    "it has also been observed that be stars are redder in v - i than normal b stars @xcite , and that those with the strongest h@xmath7 emission are also the reddest e.g. @xcite .",
    "the reason for this reddening is not entirely clear , but it seems likely that continuum emission from the disk plays a large part .",
    "there is also possibly some effect from a change in spectral energy distribution due to rotational distortion of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "keller et al .",
    "find that the be star fraction peaks at the main sequence turn - off , which suggests that the be star phenomenon occurs at a specific evolutionary stage .",
    "there are however differences in be star fraction amongst clusters of the same age , and some evidence that metallicity also affects the be star fraction @xcite .",
    "the two young clusters discussed in this paper are the lmc clusters , ngc 1805 and ngc 1818 .",

    "again there is a peak in the be star fraction around the turn - off .",
    "the most significant difference in the be star fractions of ngc1818 and ngc1805 is the lack of be stars in the range 15@xmath19v@xmath1916 in the latter . to see whether this is just due to the different selection criteria used for identifying be stars inngc1805",

    "it can be seen that the be star fraction decreases with distance from the cluster centre .",
    "this is consistent with the mass segregation of the bright stars ( v@xmath2018 ) in ngc1818 found by elson et al ..",
    "there are several populations contributing to the appearance of the bright end of the colour magnitude diagram in these young clusters - main sequence stars , be stars , binaries , evolved supergiant stars and blue stragglers .",
    "these various contributors complicate finding the age , metallicity and reddening for the clusters .",
    "for instance blue stragglers can make a cluster appear younger than it really is e.g. @xcite and binaries produce a spread at the top of the main sequence that looks similar to an age spread . in order to take these various affects into account",
    "we have compared the observations with simulations of clusters of various ages and metallicities . in this section",
    "we first discuss the simulations and then compare them with the observations to investigate the cluster parameters .",
    "synthetic colour - magnitude diagrams are generated using the rapid evolution code developed by hurley , pols & tout which covers all aspects of the evolution from the main - sequence up to , and including , the remnant stages .",
    "binary evolution is accounted for by incorporating the algorithm described by hurley .",
    "this model , which supercedes the work of tout et al .",
    ", includes tidal circularization and synchronization , angular momentum loss mechanisms , mass transfer , common - envelope evolution , collisions and supernova kicks .",
    "these evolution algorithms allow realistic cmds to be developed accurately and efficiently , for any age and for all metallicities in the range @xmath21 to 0.03 . at present these simulations",
    "do not allow for stellar rotation , which is known to move massive stars redward in the colour magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "the synthetic cmds are particularly useful for comparison with observed clusters whose stellar populations have not been significantly altered by dynamical interactions , such as the young clusters described here . in the case of dense , or dynamically old , clusters the interaction between cluster environment and the evolution of the constituent stars must be consistently taken into account when simulating cmds .",
    "for this reason the stellar and binary evolution algorithms have been incorporated into a state - of - the - art @xmath22-body code @xcite but this is not used in this work .    to compare with the data we have run simulations with ages of 10 , 25 and 40 myr and metallicities z = 0.01 and 0.02 .",
    "these ages and metallicities encompass the literature values and are also implied by the isochrones shown in figure  [ fig : vicolmag ] .",
    "there are approximately 850000 stars per simulation with masses down to 0.1 m@xmath23 .",
    "the initial mass function for single stars is taken from kroupa , tout & gilmore .",
    "the simulated binary fraction is 35% , with binary masses taken from the initial mass function of kroupa , tout & gilmore as this has not been corrected for the effects of binaries , and a uniform distribution of mass - ratios .",
    "figure  [ fig:25sim ] plots the simulated cmd for an age of 25myr metallicity z=0.02 .",
    "here we just show half ( @xmath0425000 ) the total number of simulated stars .",
    "the blue stragglers are plotted with asterisks .",
    "they are defined in the simulation as main - sequence stars with a mass @xmath24turn - off mass .",
    "this definition does not identify blue stragglers in binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig:25sim ] shows that , as well as sitting above the turn - off in the region where blue stragglers have been found observationally , there are also simulated blue stragglers below and blueward of the turn - off .",
    "these less luminous blue stragglers are the result of binary interactions of stars below the turn - off .",
    "if present in sufficient numbers in a cluster they could cause a widening of the main sequence around the turn - off in the colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this would then complicate the search for age spreads amongst the massive stars as these also produce a spread in colour at a given magnitude .",
    "the absolute numbers of blue stragglers in the simulations are somewhat arbitrary , as the blue straggler numbers are most likely affected by the cluster structure and dynamical evolution in ways that are currently not well understood .",
    "we therefore use the simulations to find the position of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagrams and hence locate possible blue stragglers in the real clusters .    to add the observed errors to the simulations we have modelled the observed error distribution , and found the model that makes the colour spread in the observed and simulated cmds the same for 18@xmath25v@xmath1920 .    from each simulation",
    "we find the expected number of stars in each cluster .",
    "the simulation is normalised to the data using the number of observed and simulated stars with 17@xmath19v@xmath1919 .",
    "this magnitude range avoids background contamination and also the bright star region where the blue straggler fraction is somewhat uncertain .",
    "first we find the metallicity that best describes the cluster cmds .",
    "as can be seen from the isochrones in figure  [ fig : vicolmag ] , for v@xmath2619 the isochrone shape depends only on metallicity and not on age .",
    "also , the reddening vector is virtually parallel to the main sequence in this region and so reddening also does not significantly affect the fit .",
    "we have checked whether the background lmc field population could be influencing our metallicity determination using the colour - magnitude diagram in figures 3 & 8 of hunter et al .. these show that there is very little difference between the pre and post background subtraction colour - magnitude diagrams at all magnitudes , and for stars brighter than v@xmath021 there is no difference .",
    "figure  [ fig : metsim ] shows the observed and simulated cmds of ngc1818 and ngc1805 . in ngc1805",
    "there is a small colour shift between the chips ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) , and so we just compare the simulations to the colour - magnitude diagram from the pc chip , which contains most of the bright cluster stars .",
    "the points are the observed data and the grey scale is the simulation . the grey scale gives the expected number of stars in a box of width ( v - i ) 0.01 mags and height ( v ) 0.1 mags .",
    "the simulation has age 25 myr , metallicity z=0.02 and the data have been de - reddened assuming e(b - v)=0.075 . for ease of comparison",
    "the be stars have been removed from the real data in figure  [ fig : metsim].both of the clusters are described well by the simulation for v@xmath2619 .",
    "the solar metallicity that we find here is higher than the [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.4 that is expected for the lmc clusters ( see discussion in section  [ sec : intro ] )",
    ". it could be the case that these clusters are more metal - rich than the surrounding population as there are no metallicity measurements for stars in ngc1805 and only a couple of stars measured with high resolution in ngc1818",
    ". some of the difference could however be due to a systematic error in the calibration of hst magnitudes to johnson - cousins which , as noted in subsection  [ subsec : wfpc2red ] could be as high as 0.04 in v - i .",
    "next we fix the simulation metallicity at z=0.02 and consider the age of each cluster .",
    "the age affects the appearance of the cmd at bright mags ( v@xmath1918 ) .",
    "we have compared each cluster to 10 , 25 and 40 myr old simulations , and also to combined simulations of two ages , 10&25 myr and 25&40 myr .",
    "the latter are used to provide constraints on any age spread in the clusters .",
    "the isochrones in figure  [ fig : vicolmag ] illustrate that the red supergiant positions in the cmd are mostly affected by age .",
    "the observed red supergiant numbers and magnitudes rule out the 10 myr old simulation . unfortunately , as can also be seen from figure  [ fig : vicolmag ] , the exposure time for the f814w observations was long enough to saturate these stars and so the red supergiant positions do not allow us to distinguish between the 25 and 40 myr old simulations .",
    "most of the red supergiants are not saturated in the v vs v - h colour - magnitude diagrams in figure  [ fig : vhcolmag ] . in these cmds",
    "the red supergiant positions are consistent with ages of 25 myr or 25&40 myr for ngc1818 and 40 myr or 25&40 myr for ngc1805 .    to compare the observations and the different age simulations we first look at the shape of the observed and expected cmds .",
    "the reddening also affects the position of the cmd at bright magnitudes , and so we have compared simulations and observations for 25 , 40 , 10&25 and 25&40 myr and e(b - v ) between 0 and 1 .",
    "we find that only the 25 myr and 25&40 myr simulations with e(b - v)=0.075 , describe well the observed shape . to distinguish between these two simulations we look at the observed and expected numbers of bright stars in 0.5 mag bins down the main sequence .",

    "stars pass through this region of the colour - magnitude diagram comparatively quickly and hence very few are expected to be observed there .",
    "however , keller et al .",
    "find stars located in this region in the lmc clusters they study ( ngc330 , ngc1818 , ngc2004 and ngc2100 ) .",
    "we find three possible blue hertzsprung gap stars ( all with i lower limits ) in ngc1818 ( consistent with keller et al . who find two ) and one star in this region in ngc1805 .",
    "keller et al .  have effective temperatures for their blue hertzsprung gap stars and therefore they rule out the possibility that the stars are blue stragglers , and suggest instead that they may be due to internal mixing in main - sequence stars in excess of that predicted by standard overshoot models .",
    "we have analysed hst v , i ( wfpc2 ) and h ( nicmos2 ) observations of two young lmc clusters ngc1818 and ngc1805 .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagrams of both clusters appear very similar .",
    "we identify be stars in ngc1818 using an archive h@xmath7 image and find that the fraction of be stars decreases with radius from the cluster centre .",
    "this is consistent with the mass segregation known to exist in this cluster .",
    "there is some evidence that the fraction of be stars in ngc1805 may differ from that in ngc1818 , but this requires further investigation .",
    "ngc1818 and ngc1805 do not contain large blue straggler populations .",
    "ngc1818 contains three stars that are located in the blue hertzsprung gap ( two of these are just consistent with the location of blue stragglers ) and ngc1805 contains one star in this region .",
    "the star in ngc1805 also lies on the edge of the blue straggler region .",
    "however these blue hertzsprung gap stars are most likely not blue stragglers @xcite",
    ". further observations of blue stragglers in clusters of all ages , in parallel with n - body simulations , are required to understand the parameters which influence the blue straggler fraction .    to obtain the cluster parameters ( age and metallicity )",
    "we have compared the cluster colour - magnitude diagrams to sophisticated stellar population simulations . comparing with simulations of a single age",
    "we find that both clusters are best fit with solar metallicity and an age of 25 myr .",
    "the fit is improved if the simulations contain @xmath0equal masses of stars of 25 & 40 myr .",
    "this possible age spread is @xmath0 a few dynamical times in these clusters .",
    "such a timescale does not allow us to constrain the efficiency of the star formation process as both high and low efficiency will leave a bound cluster ( assuming that the lmc clusters are young analogs to the galactic globulars ) .",
    "high efficiency is suggested by the similarity of observed density profiles in lmc clusters @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that , as well as lying above and bluewards of the turnoff , blue stragglers also appear just below and blueward of the turn - off , where they do not stand out observationally , but do increase the width and number density of stars in those regions of the colour - magnitude diagram . the exact numbers of blue stragglers in the simulations is somewhat arbitrary and we find that the best fit is obtained between the simulations and observations if there are significant numbers of these fainter blue stragglers in both clusters .",
    "we would like to thank stefan keller for telling us about the archival h@xmath7 images .",
