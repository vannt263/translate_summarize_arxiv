    "the basic method of studying very high energy cosmic rays ( cr ) is the air shower technique , which amounts to investigate nuclear - electro - magnetic cascades  extensive air showers ( eas )",
    " induced by energetic cosmic ray particles in the atmosphere .",
    "contemporary eas experiments resemble to a large extent their accelerator counterparts in the sense that in both cases one applies sophisticated simulation procedures to obtain a good understanding of the measurements and to interprete the data . in cr",
    "experiments an unavoidable complication is that one deals with particle interactions at energies significantly in excess of those of present colliders . in particular , this is a severe problem for the description of the backbone of air showers  the hadronic cascade , as the corresponding microscopic theory ",
    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  is inapplicable for the treatment of general hadronic collisions and the data on secondary particle production in the fragmentation region , being of crucial importance for the description of eas development , are rather scarce , especially , for scattering on nuclear targets",
    ". the situation can be improved by employing phenomenological hadronic monte carlo ( mc ) models , e.g.  dpmjet @xcite , qgsjet @xcite , sibyll @xcite , or the new qgsjet - ii @xcite and epos @xcite models .",
    "being based on some underlying theoretical approaches , they relate different interaction characteristics to each other and allow one to extrapolate the interaction picture to different kinematic regions and for different types of colliding particles , within particular model framework .",
    "correspondingly , they are characterized by a restricted number of adjustable parameters , which can be fitted with available data .",
    "however , any model is only a model , its microscopic content being restricted by only a number of possible physics mechanisms .",
    "thus , one can not exclude the possibility that something important is missing , especially , concerning the very high energy range . on the other hand",
    ", even the underlying theoretical ideas may appear to be wrong .",
    "this explains the need for alternative model approaches and for continuing tests of model validity , using both accelerator and cosmic ray data .",
    "meanwhile , the spread in model predictions may give some feeling on the corresponding uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it is presently commonly accepted that high energy hadronic ( nuclear ) collisions are mediated by multiple parton cascades , proceeding in parallel . at not too high energies",
    "all parton branchings in a cascade are characterized by a small 4-momentum squared @xmath0 transferred , the processes generally referred to as non - perturbative soft ones . by the uncertainty principle , at each step the newly emitted parton is separated from its parent by a non - small distance @xmath1 in the transverse plane .",
    "as a consequence , the interaction region widens with energy , remaining at the same moment rather dilute , with a small parton density per unit area .",
    "on the other hand , with the energy increasing one observes a sizable contribution of so - called semi - hard processes , where some parton emissions proceed with a comparatively large momentum transfer @xmath2 , @xmath3 being some cutoff for pqcd being applicable , and result in the production of observed hadron jets of high @xmath4 .",
    "the smallness of the strong coupling @xmath5 , characteristic for such processes , is compensated by large logarithmic factors and by high number of partons in the cascade @xcite .",
    "such hard parton branchings proceed with a negligible displacement in the transverse plane , leading to a rapid rise of parton densities .",
    "thus , one can to a some extent separate hadronic collisions at large and small impact parameters .",
    "the former are characterized by low parton densities and mainly proceed via non - perturbative soft processes .",
    "the latter are more and more dominated with increasing energy by the contribution of semi - hard processes ; one deals there with large numbers of partons being closely packed , which results in significant non - linear effects : different cascades fuse together , preventing parton densities from further increase @xcite .",
    "how this picture transforms in the very high energy limit ?",
    "there , dominant semi - hard contributions look as follows .",
    "first , the underlying parton cascade develops in the soft low virtuality region , with small @xmath6 partons diffusing towards larger impact parameters .",
    "then , hard parton branchings become efficient ; new partons are produced without sizable transverse displacements , contributing to the overall parton density increase at a given point .",
    "as the result , the black high density region extends to larger and larger impact parameters . on the other hand , the dilute peripheral region always persists outside the black one , being formed by purely soft parton cascading . in general , one expects that with increasing energy the parton density in the black region is saturated up to comparatively high values of parton virtualities and the relevant processes can , in principle , be described within the perturbative formalism @xcite , while the peripheral region remains governed by non - perturbative physics . according to present data , the relative sizes of the dense and the dilute areas remain comparable in the collider energy range @xcite",
    ", the peripheral collisions thus giving an important contribution to observed quantities .",
    "in reality , the discussed separation of central and peripheral collisions is rather crude , as the average parton densities rise gradually with decreasing impact parameter .",
    "thus , there exists an important transition region of moderately large impact parameters , characterized by large but not yet saturated parton densities , where the contributions of both soft and semi - hard processes are of equal importance , and where non - linear parton effects provide sizable corrections .",
    "in fact , it is the treatment of such non - linear interaction contributions in the dense and in the transition regimes which is the main challenge for contemporary hadronic interaction models .",
    "the qgsjet model , being based on the pomeron phenomenology @xcite , describes hadronic multiple scattering processes as multiple exchanges of composite objects  pomerons , corresponding to independent microscopic parton cascades . for",
    "the soft low virtuality cascades a phenomenological soft pomeron amplitude is employed , whereas semi - hard scattering processes are treated as exchanges of semi - hard pomerons , the latter composed of a piece of qcd parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons @xcite ; the soft pomerons and the ladder describing correspondingly the low and high virtuality parts of the underlying parton cascade .",
    "the principal feature of qgsjet - ii is the treatment of non - linear parton effects described as pomeron - pomeron interactions , based on all order re - summation of the corresponding reggeon field theory diagrams @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of the scheme is that pomeron - pomeron coupling is dominated by non - perturbative parton processes and can be described by means of phenomenological multi - pomeron vertices .",
    "the approach allows one to obtain a consistent description of various hadronic cross sections and structure functions , including diffractive ones , for a fixed , energy - independent @xmath7-cutoff @xcite .",
    "presently it is the most advanced model for the description of hadronic interactions in the peripheral and the transition regimes .",
    "however , in central collisions one may expect sizable corrections to come from hard ( high @xmath0 ) pomeron - pomeron coupling , which is neglected in qgsjet - ii .",
    "a reasonable agreement of the model predictions for central nucleus - nucleus collisions with the data of rhic collider indicates the smallness of such effects @xcite . nevertheless , the situation may change at much higher energies .",
    "sibyll  2.1 @xcite also employs pomeron formalism for the description of soft processes , while semi - hard ones are treated in the framework of the mini - jet approach @xcite , which is qualitatively similar to the above - discussed semi - hard pomeron scheme ( the differences between the two approaches are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the treatment of non - linear effects in that model is essentially orthogonal to the one in qgsjet - ii , being based on the parton saturation approach @xcite .",
    "namely , it is assumed that semi - hard processes result in the production of partons of transverse momenta larger than some effective energy - dependent saturation scale , @xmath8 , for which the double leading - log ansatz @xcite is used .",
    "however , the correlation between actual parton densities and the saturation scale holds in the model only in average sense , i.e.  it reflects the increase of the average density with energy ; the same scale is used both for dense central and for dilute peripheral collisions .",
    "on the other hand , non - linear effects are neglected for the soft interaction component .",
    "the latter is partly cured in dpmjet - iii @xcite , taking into consideration lowest order diagrams for pomeron - pomeron interactions .    the epos model , being the successor to nexus @xcite , employs the above - discussed soft and semi - hard pomeron scheme and , in contrast to all other mc generators , takes into account energy - momentum correlations between multiple re - scatterings @xcite ( see also @xcite for a qualitative discussion ) .",
    "the description of non - linear effects is based on an effective treatment of lowest order pomeron - pomeron interaction graphs , with the corresponding parameters being adjusted from comparison with rhic data .",
    "a big advantage of the model is an excellent calibration to available accelerator data .",
    "however , its extrapolation towards very high energies may depend on the adopted empirical parameterizations for non - linear interaction contributions .",
    "although the spread in contemporary model predictions for eas characteristics is much more moderate than ten years ago @xcite , it is still quite significant . among the most model - dependent quantities is the shower maximum position , which depends on the corresponding results for total inelastic and diffractive cross sections and for the inelasticity of proton - air interactions .",
    "the predicted inelastic cross sections of different models stay in reasonable agreement at collider energy range and sizably diverge at highest cr energies , the largest values coming from the sibyll model . on the other hand ,",
    "model predictions for the inelasticity of proton - air interactions and for the rate of diffraction processes differ significantly at all energies . in general , both cross sections and inelasticities are likely to be dominated by the contribution of hadronic collisions in the peripheral and the transition regimes , for which qgsjet - ii provides a more elaborate description , compared to other mc generators",
    ". an important test of model predictions will be provided by the lhcf experiment @xcite , which will measure leading neutron spectra in proton - proton collisions .",
    "this observable appears to be sensitive both to the average inelasticity and to projectile proton diffraction dissociation ; there are almost an order of magnitude differences in model predictions for the forward neutron spectra , which can be well discriminated by the experiment @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the high energy behavior of the total proton - proton cross section will be reliably fixed by the corresponding lhc measurement .",
    "an important topic are model predictions for the cr muon component . here",
    "one has to distinguish between the results for inclusive muon spectra and for eas muon content for a given primary energy .",
    "the former are dominated by single interactions of primary protons of energies in average only an order of magnitude higher than the ones of measured muons . due to the steepness of the primary cr spectrum , the corresponding results are very sensitive to the shape of the forward pion and kaon spectra in proton - air collisions . comparing with recent accelerator measurements @xcite",
    ", one finds that the old qgsjet predicts too soft pion spectra , while sibyll and qgsjet - ii stay in a reasonably good agreement with data .",
    "however , the energy dependence is quite different in the two models : sibyll predicts rather precise feynman scaling in the energy range of interest ( @xmath9 tev ) , which is supported by inclusive muon flux measurements @xcite , whereas qgsjet - ii shows a noticeable scaling violation .",
    "the eas muon content is formed during a multi - step hadronic cascade process and mainly depends on the total multiplicity of hadron - air collisions .",
    "the differences between sibyll and qgsjet - ii for the predicted @xmath10 are only at @xmath11% level and from general considerations one might expect that the old qgsjet gives the upper limit for the eas muon number @xcite",
    ". however , the epos predictions for @xmath10 appeared to be significantly higher than in any other model @xcite , being in particular almost a factor of two in excess of those of qgsjet - ii .",
    "this seems only possible if the multiplicity of pion - air collisions in increased by a similar large factor @xcite . while it is problematic to verify that in collider experiments , epos predictions can be confronted with kascade air shower data @xcite ; if supported by kascade , epos may lead to a serious revision of present views on cr composition in the above - knee energy range .",
