    "it is widely accepted that infrared singularities are generally stronger in thermal field theories with bosons , compared to their counterparts at zero temperature .",
    "this is due to the singular behavior of the bose - einstein statistical weight at zero energy , which affects massless bosonic fields , the statistical weight ( to be evaluated on - shell in the real - time formalism ) is bounded by @xmath0 . ] . as a consequence of these stronger singularities ,",
    "only partial results exist concerning their cancellation in the calculation of observable quantities in thermal massless theories ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "so far , there is no general translation in the language of thermal field theory of the arguments given for this cancellation at @xmath1 by kinoshita  @xcite , and lee and nauenberg  @xcite .",
    "the resummation of hard thermal loops ( htl in the following ) @xcite cures partly this problem by giving a thermal mass to otherwise massless fields , like gauge bosons .",
    "nevertheless , the static magnetic ( transverse ) modes remain massless in this framework and may still generate infrared singularities , as exemplified by the calculation of the fermion damping rate  @xcite . in qcd , it is believed that a thermal mass for the static transverse modes is generated non perturbatively at the scale @xmath2 , but this mass may be too small to be an efficient regulator .    , arising from the htl resummation in the hard limit . _ ]    a particular area where this infrared problem becomes relevant is the thermal production of particles . in this paper , we focus mainly on the production of photons by a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the production rates are calculated as the imaginary part of a self - energy diagram evaluated at finite temperature @xcite , and are expected to be observable quantities that should come out finite in a consistent calculation .    in a recent study @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that 2-loop contributions involving the bremsstrahlung mechanism overwhelms 1-loop contributions for the production of a soft real photon .",
    "the insertion of an exchanged gluon in the hard quark loop ( see fig .  [ fig:2-loop ] ) generates collinear singularities which are power like in 2-loop diagrams while they are only logarithmic in the 1-loop contributions : as a consequence , when these singularities are regularized by the resummation of the thermal mass @xmath3 on the quark propagators , the two - loop diagrams get an enhancement by powers of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the strong coupling constant .    the contribution of the diagram of fig",
    ".  [ fig:2-loop ] , although dominated by a soft gluon , is infrared finite .",
    "in fact , even the contribution of the transverse gluon is finite in this particular calculation , due to kinematical constraints .",
    "indeed , it is trivial to see that the two delta functions corresponding to the cut quarks @xmath6 become @xmath7 in the limit of vanishing @xmath8 , and that the latter pair of delta functions do not have a common support if @xmath9 : for the bremsstrahlung process we are considering here the energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 have the same sign and hence @xmath12 and @xmath13 can not vanish simultaneously , whatever the value of @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore kinematics , via the _ fermion _ thermal mass , that prevents infrared singularities in this particular topology by providing a natural cutoff of order @xmath15 on the gluon momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this statement was tested in @xcite by studying the limit @xmath16 .",
    "a stronger divergence was found in the transverse gluon contribution , indicating that @xmath17 played a role in the regularization of this potentially dangerous contribution .",
    "but this kinematical cut - off does not apply to additional soft gluons one may insert in the quark loop , like in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:3-loop ] for instance .",
    "indeed , in topologies involving more than one exchanged gluon , the kinematical argument given above constrains only the _ sum _ of the momenta of the cut gluons .",
    "therefore , we know that @xmath18 can not vanish , which tells us that ( for instance ) @xmath8 has a lower bound at the scale @xmath15 , but @xmath19 can still become arbitrary small is of order @xmath15 and @xmath8 can become arbitrary small . ] and this leads to an infrared divergence for the cut depicted on fig .  [ fig:3-loop ] when the ultra - soft gluon is transverse .",
    "indeed when compared to the 2-loop diagram , the additional gluon provides ( i ) two coupling constants , ( ii ) two quark propagators , ( iii ) a set of gluon spectral density and statistical weight and ( iv ) the phase - space of the additional gluon . collecting everything",
    ", we can estimate by a crude power counting : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spectral function of the additional gluon , where @xmath22 is introduced as a regulator on the integral over @xmath23 .",
    "we used the fact that the quarks are hard , and mostly on - shell because of the cut crossing the quark loop .",
    "it is important to stress here that each fermion propagator brings an extra factor @xmath23 in the denominator thus contributing to the infrared sensitivity of the above expression .",
    "the conclusions of this naive power counting are the following :    * if the additional gluon is longitudinal , its cutoff is a thermal mass of order @xmath15 , and the corresponding contribution is suppressed by one power of @xmath5 compared to the 2-loop one . *",
    "if the additional gluon is transverse it is natural to assume the regulator to be the magnetic mass @xmath24 , and we have @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it seems that if we keep adding transverse gluons in the quark loop , we generate contributions that are all of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this fact is very similar to the argument given by linde for the breakdown of perturbation theory in thermal qcd , although in the different context of the calculation of the free energy @xcite .",
    "there is nevertheless one reason why this power counting may be too naive .",
    "one should indeed keep in mind that this estimate is valid only for a given cut through the 3-loop diagram .",
    "it does not take into account potential compensations that may occur when one is summing all the possible cuts . in this paper",
    ", we are going to study in more detail this possibility , and its interplay with a magnetic mass at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "an important feature of the above example is the fact that the _ quark propagators _ participate in the overall infrared divergence of the diagram . in fact , if some quark propagators were not becoming singular in the ir limit , the diagram would have been finite by power counting .",
    "this can be generalized to a topology with an arbitrary number of exchanged gluons ( but without 3- and 4-gluon vertices ) .",
    "indeed , for these topologies , the number of loops @xmath8 is related to the number of gluons @xmath26 by : @xmath27 one of the @xmath8 loop integrals is an integration @xmath28 over the quark momentum which is hard , and is not concerned by the ir problem .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 integrals are over the momenta of the @xmath26 soft gluons . the fact that @xmath30 tells that even if each gluon comes with the singular factor @xmath31 , it is accompanied by a phase space @xmath32 which is enough to make the integral finite . for these topologies , it is the quark propagators which are ultimately responsible for the ir divergences .",
    "indeed , it is trivial to see that if one quark propagator is cut , then some other quark propagators become infinite when the gluon momenta go to zero .",
    "this is the reason why we are going to focus on the quarks , and do not care about the gluon propagators .",
    "it is rather easy to show that there are cancellations at the level of the quark propagators occuring in the calculation of the imaginary part of @xmath33 .",
    "let us illustrate that in the reasonably general situation where we have a single quark loop to which are connected the two external photons , and an arbitrary number of internal gluons ( but without non - abelian couplings , see fig .",

    "the simple poles therefore cancel trivially .",
    "this can be extended to the more complicated situation where more than two @xmath47s tend to a common value , which amounts to prove that these denominators appear in a combination that remains finite for any configuration of the @xmath47s .",
    "for that purpose , let us consider an expression like since the compensations occur in fact for each given set of @xmath53s . ]",
    "@xmath54 and show that such a quantity is always finite provided some regularity property of the function @xmath38 . the shortest way to see that is to notice that @xmath55 is the leading coefficient of the lagrange polynomial of degree @xmath35 that interpolates between the points @xmath56 : @xmath57 as such",
    ", @xmath55 is finite for every values of the @xmath47 s if the function @xmath38 is @xmath35 times differentiable . indeed ,",
    "if several points @xmath56 collapse into a single point of multiplicity @xmath58 , the lagrange polynomial has a finite limit , and coincides with @xmath38 and its first @xmath59 derivatives at this point .",
    "one can note that this argument also applies to insertions of self - energies on the quark line .",
    "indeed , the only peculiarity of self - energy insertions is that they force several @xmath47s to have the same value even if the @xmath60 do not tend to zero ; and the above proof works for any configuration of the @xmath47s , whatever the cause that makes them equal is .",
    "although the above argument has been presented in the case of a 2-point function , it still works for the dispersive part of any @xmath35-point function ( just attach more photons or gluons to the shaded part of fig .",
    "[ fig : kln - generic ] ) .",
    "the result of the previous section is that the product of all the quark propagators remains finite in the ir sector when the sum over the cuts has been performed . when considering the imaginary part it shows that , for a fixed cut on the upper line , there is no singularity in the propagators of the lower line .",
    "the argument should be repeated for the upper line , which is made finite by summing over all the ways of cutting it .",
    "these cancellations between different cuts occur within a given topology , and correspond to compensation between real and virtual corrections .",
    "they can therefore be seen as a form of the kln theorem .",
    "we point out some differences with the usual version of the kln theorem at zero temperature where the exchanged gluons are bare gluons . at finite temperature",
    "we deal with resummed gluons and the most dangerous divergences arise when cutting space - like transverse gluons which are shielded by a `` small '' magnetic mass .",
    "the time - like gluons are shielded with a `` large '' thermal mass of order @xmath15 and do not lead to any infra - red problems in the context of this study .",
    "we are now going to apply the above considerations to study explicitly the 3-loop example already presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-loop ] .",
    "as we have already seen in the introduction , one of the gluon momenta has a lower bound thanks to kinematics , while the other gluon is not constrained in the ultra - soft limit .",
    "let us choose the gluon on the right ( momentum @xmath19 ) to be ultra - soft while momentum @xmath8 remains soft .",
    "this kinematical constraint prevents the propagators of the lower quarks to become infinite when @xmath61 : they always remain off - shell by some amount controlled by @xmath62 .",
    "the constraint also simplifies the pattern of cancellation of infrared divergences in the upper line since the propagators of momentum @xmath63 when @xmath64 can not diverge for the same reason . in consequence",
    "we need only the two cuts depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig:3-loop - cuts ] to get rid of all the zeroes in the denominators soft and @xmath8 ultra - soft which is easily done by multiplying the final result by a factor @xmath65 . ] .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to perform the change of variable @xmath66 in the second contribution , as indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig:3-loop - cuts ] .",
    "moreover , we neglect @xmath19 in front of @xmath8 whenever these two impulsions appear together ( like in @xmath67 ) . with these notations and approximations",
    ", one can readily see that the additional ultra - soft gluon brings the following factors , to be multiplied by the 2-loop integrand ( i.e. the integrand for the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2-loop ] ) , respectively for the cuts @xmath68 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the transverse projector , and @xmath72 is the transverse spectral function of the gluon ( only the transverse mode of the ultra - soft gluon is relevant , the other gluon can be transverse or longitudinal , as in the 2-loop calculation ) .",
    "the factors of form @xmath73 come from the fermion propagators in the hard momentum approximation .",
    "we can further simplify these factors by evaluating them at @xmath74 since they are to be multiplied by the 2-loop integrand which contains a @xmath75 . noticing that ( see eq .",

    "the general result established in the previous section says that the sum over the cuts for this quantity should have a finite limit when @xmath83 at fixed @xmath84 ( i.e. when the 4 components of @xmath19 tend to zero ) .",
    "one can see that this is not the case on the contributions of the individual cuts , since we have : @xmath85 ( where we have neglected terms regular in @xmath23 ) but occurs trivially for the sum of the two cuts since the singular ( @xmath86 ) part drops out .",
    "the interesting quantity is in fact the scale at which this cancellation occurs .",
    "the only dimensional quantity to which @xmath23 can be compared with in the above expressions is @xmath87 .",

    "the magnetic mass is via the following sum rule @xmath90 which is a reasonable approximation if @xmath91 is not singular at @xmath92 and does not increase too much when @xmath84 becomes large .",

    "( [ muequ0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath98 let us mention that if the additional gluon in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-loop - cuts ] is longitudinal a similar calculation as above goes through where @xmath22 is to be replaced by the debye mass of order @xmath15 , so that the factor @xmath99 is of order @xmath100 .",
    "the conclusion is therefore the following :    * if the magnetic mass @xmath22 is the relevant regulator , then the 3-loop diagram gives a  correction \" of order one to the prefactor of the 2-loop result , and this is likely to be the case for higher loop corrections also . in this regime ,",

    "it remains now to make a bit more explicit the comparison between @xmath101 and @xmath22 .",
    "for that purpose , let us recall that the expression of @xmath102 can be taken from the 2-loop calculation@xcite : @xmath103\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the angle between @xmath78 and @xmath105 , and where has been extended here to hold for hard slightly virtual photons @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath106 due to the extremely singular nature of the integral over @xmath104 @xcite , the order of magnitude of @xmath107 is @xmath108 . taking into account the fact that @xmath109 and @xmath110",

    "i , _ i.e. _ roughly the region of small virtuality , the magnetic mass is the most important regulator and , as seen above , the 3-loop contribution is as large as the 2-loop contribution : the production mechanism becomes non - perturbative and resummations should be considered .",
    "increasing the virtuality @xmath14 of the photon increases @xmath107 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : meff ] ) ) which eventually becomes the dominant cut - off and one enters region ii where the infrared sensitivity of 3-loop ( and higher loop diagrams ) becomes subdominant .    in region ii - b , the production mechanism receives a contribution from large gluon momentum and the approximations done in the previous calculations may become incorrect .",
    "however , it was found by an explicit calculation @xcite that the expressions valid in region ii - a could be safely extrapolated to the case of soft virtual photon at rest ( @xmath112 ) in region ii - b .",
    "however , there is the possibility that 3-loop diagrams give important contributions in region iii due to hard gluon exchanges , but this is a different story .",
    "in this paper , we have considered higher order corrections to photon production by a quark - gluon plasma , with emphasis on the infrared singularities due to ultra - soft transverse gluons .",
    "when one sums over all the possible cuts through a given abelian topology , there are cancellations that prevent the quark propagators from becoming infinite , making the higher - loop corrections infrared finite .",
    "the generalization of this result to non - abelian topologies is not straightforward .",
    "indeed , the above argument is flawed already at the stage of counting the number of gluon propagators . loosely speaking ,",
    "because of the 3- and 4-gluon couplings , the number of gluons can be larger than the number of independent momenta . the loop counting for qcd",
    "gives for the number of gluon integrations @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are respectively the number of 3- and 4-gluon vertices . as a consequence , unlike in the abelian topologies for which @xmath30 , the gluon propagators play an active role in the kln compensations ( if any ) , and much more elaborate arguments are required . as a side note , it is also impossible to apply in the thermal case the heuristic power counting argument of poggio and quinn @xcite , since some gluons have an infrared count of @xmath116 ( instead of @xmath117 at @xmath1 ) because of the bose - einstein statistical weight .",
    "we have also considered the possible competition of this mechanism of regularization with a hypothetical magnetic mass of order @xmath2 .",
    "the result is that there exists a region in the @xmath111 plane ( roughly speaking , for photons of small invariant mass ) where the magnetic mass is the dominant regulator , and where the higher - loop corrections are as large as the two - loop result , and should be resummed .",
    "further extensions of this work include the treatment of non - abelian topologies , the study of resummations in the region where the magnetic mass dominates , the extension of the 2-loop calculation for hard massive photons , and also the study of how the finite lifetime of quarks in a plasma affects the collinear singularities found at 2-loop .",
