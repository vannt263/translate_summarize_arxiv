    "recent growth of the interest in complexes of domain walls ( dws ) in quasi-1d ferromagnets is due to hopes for miniaturization of information registers and logical devices based on magnetic nanowires , @xcite , and nanorings @xcite .",

    "it is shown that both kinds of the dws are exact stationary solutions to the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation in 2d ( different realizations of the cross - tie dw @xcite ) , however , their orientations in the stripe plane are distinguished by different boundary conditions . both transverse and vortex",
    "dws are characterized by two features ; a chirality ( the direction of magnetization rotation in the stripe plane ) which is clockwise or counterclockwise one and a polarity ( the direction of magnetization alignment in a vortex / halfvortex center ) which is positive or negative one @xcite .",
    "pairs of the dws of the opposite ( like ) both the chiralities and polarities are found to constitute exact stationary solutions to llg in the absence of external field , hence , they do not interact .",
    "the interactions of the dws of opposite chiralities and of like polarities ( as well as of like chiralities and of opposite polarities ) are studied within a perturbation calculus previously developed with relevance to dws in 1d ferromagnetic wire and in critical systems @xcite .",
    "evaluating the dependence of energy of the two - dw systems on the distance between the dws , i analyze the creation of stationary bound states of two dws ( magnetic bubbles ) .    in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "even dws of the opposite chiralities and polarities ( of like chiralities and polarities ) interact .",
    "the field - induced collision of such dws is studied applying a method developed to 1d systems in @xcite . for this aim , an extension of the ( dissipative ) evolution equation of magnetization",
    "is performed in a way to describe the dynamics in the limits of large positive and large negative values of time .",

    "such a motion has to be decelerated and , eventually , suppressed when the decrease of the dw interaction energy equals the increase of the zeeman energy .",
    "it results in formation of a stationary bubble which is a counterpart of hard bubbles in 1d systems @xcite .",
    "in terms of the application of multi - dw systems to the magnetic storage , the important result of the present study is the prediction of bound states of noninteracting dws [ which are of opposite ( like ) chiralities and polarities ] in the absence of any external field .",
    "such bound states are stable with respect to simultaneous change of both the chirality and polarity of one of the dws of the bubble .",
    "unlike stationary bubbles in 1d ferromagnets which are composed of one neel dw and one bloch dw , the bubbles in magnetic stripes are composed of dws of the same energy , hence , they can be stable . in 1d systems ,",
    "the instability is a simple consequence of the fact that the neel dws are of higher energy than the bloch ones and they tend to the reorientation into the bloch walls in presence of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the possibility of maintaining stable train of many dws in magnetic stripes without external power supply ( without application of the magnetic field ) makes such systems potentially useful as magnetic information registers .",
    "the result of the field - induced collision of dws of opposite chiralities and polarities ( or of like chiralities and polarities ) is found to be their reflection .",
    "hence , they can form a stripe counterpart of the hard bubbles of magnetization of wide ferromagnetic platelets .",
    "another finding to be stressed is the existence of stationary bound state of two vortex dws of like chiralities and of opposite polarities ( a @xmath220-dw ) in the absence of any external field .",
    "it follows from fig . 3b",
    "that the energy of the relevant pair of vortex dws @xmath122 achieves minims at @xmath221 .",
    "they correspond to the final state of the long - term evolution of a breather .",
    "such a state has no counterpart in 1d ferromagnet while it has a counterpart in critical media described with ginzburg - landau ( or a nonlinear schrodinger ) equation @xcite .",
