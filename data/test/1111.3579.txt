    "flares are one of the most important components of solar activity and result in sudden releases of magnetic energy and in massive magnetic field restructuring in the host active regions .",
    "they are made of two distinct phases : a very short impulsive phase - when magnetic energy is suddenly released and plasma is rapidly heated to temperatures that may exceed 15  mk - and a long decay phase , where the plasma cools back to lower temperatures .",
    "most of flare observations have been carried out using crystal spectrometers observing below 20    or narrow - band imagers with bandpasses optimized at wavelengths below 50   , where the emission from multimillion degrees plasmas is best observed .",
    "x - ray spectral observations of the decay phase of flares have invarably shown a slow decrease of the plasma temperature , down to a few million degrees .",
    "a large body of literature has been devoted to study the properties of such decaying plasmas .",
    "when the flare plasma temperature decreases below a few million degrees , it fades from x - ray instruments and can not be studied anymore with x - ray spectroscopic diagnostic techniques . as a consequence",
    ", no diagnostic studies could be made of the evolution of the post - flare plasmas in the last phases of cooling .",
    "euv imagers , such as soho / eit , trace , stereo / euvi and sdo / aia , sample quiescent coronal temperatures of @xmath2  mk and thus can extend decay phase flare observations down to lower temperatures .",
    "however , since they rely on broad - band filters , they can only provide limited diagnostic results .",
    "sumer , observing in the 500 - 1600    uv range , provides a golden opportunity to monitor the behavior of decaying plasma down to chromospheric temperatures , thanks to the multitude of coronal , transition region and chromospheric lines that populate its spectral range . during its operational life ,",
    "sumer observed a number of c and m flares , and some of its observations lasted enough to let the post - flare plasma cover the entire evolution from the impulsive to the very end of the decay phase .",
    "however , the spectroscopic diagnostic potential of sumer has never been exploited to try to study the evolution of the post - flare plasma below 2  mk .",
    "the aim of the present work is to carry out such a study .",
    "recently , feldman _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) reported on sumer observations of the evolution a c8 flare from the impulsive phase down to below 1  mk .",
    "the advantage of their observations was that they covered the 1097 - 1119    spectral range , which includes spectral lines formed at all temperatures from 0.01  mk to 15  mk .",
    "the observation lasted enough to allow them to follow the evolution of the flare plasma from the impulsive phase to well beyond the lower temperature limit imposed by the use of x - ray instrumentation .",
    "they found that the plasma continued to cool through quasi - equilibrium states until it reached @xmath32 - 3  mk .",
    "below that threshold , feldman _",

    "( 2003 ) reported a dramatic change in the emission , with the surprising , sudden appearance at the same time of lines from ions formed between 0.01  mk and 1  mk that were not expected to be observed simultaneously in a plasma in ionization equilibrium .",
    "their observations suggested that the plasma was undergoing thermal non - equilibrium .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) did not investigate this final feature of their observation , and limited themselves to reporting the light curves of the cooling flare plasma .",
    "the aim of the present work is to revisit the observations of feldman _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) and investigate in detail the scenario of thermal non - equilibrium in the final phase of the flare decay , using a state - of - the - art time - dependent loop hydrodynamic code which includes non equilibrium ionization . in particular",
    ", we focus on predicting the light curves of all lines emitted in the late phase of flare decay , and on comparing them to the sumer observations",
    ". we will show that thermal non - equilibrium , i.e. a catastrophic cooling of a coronal plasma , develops naturally in a standard flaring loop simulation late in the decay in agreement with observations , and that it is able to explain well the sequence and timing of appearance of the observed lines .",
    "this observation represents an excellent testing ground of the presence of thermal non - equilibrium in the sun , and it is expected to be of significant value to study several phenomena other than flares .",
    "in fact , thermal non - equilibrium may produce plasma flows , the formation of condensations and the loss of connection between electron temperature and the ionization status of a plasma .",
    "thermal non - equilibrium has been suggested to be responsible for the formation of prominences from coronal loops ( e.g. antiochos 1980 , karpen _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 and references therein ) and intensity variations traveling along the loop structure ( mller _ et al .",

    "also , it has been recently suggested as a possible explanation of the main observational properties of coronal loops , including lifetime , temperature and density profiles , and filamentary structure ( klimchuk _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) .",
    "in addition , observations of the decay phase of flares have been recently made with the sdo / eve instrument ( woods _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) , which observes the emission of the entire sun between 1 and 1060    at a reduced resolution of 1    ( 60 - 1060     range ) and 10    ( 1 - 60    range ) .",

    "thus , the entire field of view of the sumer slit was placed outside the solar limb , above an active region .",
    "the 1097 - 1119    wavelength range was transmitted to the ground after being observed with an exposure time of 162.5  s. the choice of such a limited wavelength range was dictated by the need of a relatively fast cadence , but it allowed us to include spectral lines from ions formed at all temperatures of the solar corona .",

    "x - ray data from goes show that it started at 19:49  ut and by 20:20  ut it had faded in the x - ray background . despite the disappearance from goes x - ray data , the flare plasma kept evolving : thanks to the wide range of formation temperature of the lines in the 1097 - 1119    range , sumer was able to observe the flare for a much wider time interval , spanning from the very beginning of the impulsive phase to much beyond the end of the goes x - ray flare .",

    "( 2004 ) , who modeled a flare in proxima centauri observed with xmm with two different populations of loops . in a similar way",
    ", the initial and pulses observed by sumer in the 26 septemper 2000 flare may be due to a different kind of loops than the rest of the decay phase observed with all the other ions , and thus can not be modeled together with the latter in a single - loop framework .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) found that the plasma emitting during the decay phase of the flare between 20  ut and 21  ut was close to isothermal , and its temperature decreased exponentially with time from 7.9  mk to 2.5  mk .",
    "then , they reported the simultaneous emission of several ions whose temperature of formation under ionization equilibrium spanned more than one order of magnitude .",

    "et al .  _",
    "we measured the intensities of all lines in this position as a function of time , and displayed their normalized values in figure  [ light_curves ] .",

    "the surprising feature of figure  [ light_curves ] is the sudden appearance ( at around 21  ut ) and co - existence of the emission from ( formed in equilibrium at @xmath5 ) , ( @xmath6 ) , ( @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these ions are emitted by a previously cooling , near - isothermal plasma undergoing a series of equilibrium states , and yet can not be emitted simultaneously by an isothermal plasma in ionization equilibrium as their temperature ranges of formation do not overlap .",
    "the most likely explanation to the presence of the emission from these ions is that the cooling post - flare plasma undergoes a thermal instability as it reaches @xmath10  mk .",
    "the modeling effort of the present work is aimed at reproducing the light curves of the thermal instability after 21  ut .",
    "we are particularly interested at studying the succession of rise and fall of the emission in the colder ions .",
    "the plasma temperature was estimated by feldman _",

    "( 2003 ) assuming that the plasma evolved through quasi - equilibrium states from right after the impulsive phase ( around 20:05  ut , approximately 15 minutes after the goes beginning of the flare ) down to 20:45  ut , so that the shape of the and light curves could be fitted using the contribution functions of the two lines .",
    "the @xmath11 of the plasma was found to evolve linearly with time from an initial @xmath12 at 20:05  ut to @xmath13 at 20:45  ut .",
    "the free - free emission was observed until 21:05  ut and it allowed to determine that the plasma composition was similar to the standard composition of the solar corona ; this means that the plasma in the decay phase of the flare had a local , coronal origin rather than being evaporated from the chromosphere .",
    "the plasma density was determined by feldman _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) by using the value of the total emission measure they derived from the free - free radiation and an assumed value of the total length of the flaring plasma along the line of sight . however , there are two ions in the 1097 - 1119    range that emit more than one line : and .",
    "the former provides a ratio which is density sensitive in the @xmath14 range ( @xmath15 in @xmath16 ) , so that we can attempt a crude estimate using the emissivities from the chianti database ( dere _ et al .",

    "we aim at explaining the evolution of the observed emission through the hydrodynamic modeling of a flare - heated plasma confined in a coronal magnetic flux tube as in reale & orlando ( 2008 ) .",

    "the loops lie on a plane vertical to the solar surface .",
    "it is assumed that the loop plasma moves and transports energy only along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the plasma evolution can then be described by one - dimensional ( 1-d ) hydrodynamics ( e.g. , peres _",
    "et al .  _ 1982 ) :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    is the total gas energy ( internal energy , @xmath28 , and kinetic energy ) , @xmath29 the time , @xmath30 the coordinate along the loop , @xmath31 the mass density , @xmath32 the mean atomic mass ( assuming solar abundances ) , @xmath33 the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath34 the hydrogen number density , @xmath35 the electron number density , @xmath36 the plasma flow velocity , @xmath37 the pressure , @xmath38 the component of gravity parallel to the field lines , @xmath39 the temperature , @xmath40 the conductive flux , @xmath41 a function describing the transient input heating , @xmath42 the radiative losses per unit emission measure ( rosner et al . 1978 ) .",
    "the radiative losses are assumed from plasma in ionization equilibrium and are set to zero for @xmath43 k , to ensure the detailed energy balance in the chromosphere .",
    "tests have shown that the simulation results do not change considerably because of local and temporary changes of the radiative losses function , as those due by transient deviations from equilibrium of ionization ( reale & orlando 2008 ) .",
    "we use the ideal gas law , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ratio of specific heats .",

    "this effect may be important even in the late phases of the flare .",
    "therefore in our modeling we also compute the ionization fractions of the most important elements ( namely he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni ) , by solving synchronously but independently the continuity equations for each ion species :    @xmath46    @xmath47~,\\ ] ]    @xmath48 is the number density of the @xmath49-th ion of the element @xmath50 , @xmath51 the number of elements , @xmath52 the number of ionization states of element @xmath50 , @xmath53 the collisional and dielectronic recombination coefficients , and @xmath54 the collisional ionization coefficients ( summers 1974 ) .    as discussed in reale & orlando ( 2008 ) , the heat conduction may become `` flux limited '' during flares ( e.g. brown _ et al .",

    "2005 for details of the implementation ) , the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) effects ( see reale & orlando 2008 for the details ) , the radiative losses , and the heating function .    as for the initial conditions , before the flare the loop plasma is assumed to be in pressure and energy equilibrium according to serio _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1981 ) and to orlando _ et al .  _",
    "the plasma is very cool and tenuous : the pressure at the base of the corona is @xmath69 dyn  @xmath70 , which corresponds to a maximum temperature @xmath71  mk at the loop apex , according to the loop scaling laws ( rosner _ et al .  _ 1978 ) .",
    "since the pressure increases enormously during the flare , the flare evolution is largely independent of these initial conditions .",
    "the coronal part of the loop is linked to an isothermal chromosphere at @xmath72 k and @xmath73 cm thick , which acts only as a mass reservoir .",
    "all the ion species are assumed to be initially in ionization equilibrium everywhere in the loop .    since we assume that the loop is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis across the apex , we simulate only half of the loop .",
    "for the case @xmath74 cm , the computational domain spans a total extension of @xmath75 cm , including the chromosphere which has a thickness of @xmath76 cm . at the coarsest resolution , the adaptive mesh algorithm used in the  code (; macneice _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) uniformly covers the computational domain with a mesh of @xmath77 blocks , each with @xmath78 cells .",
    "we allow for 3 levels of refinement , with resolution increasing twice at each refinement level . the refinement criterion adopted ( lhner 1987 ) follows the changes in density and temperature . with this grid configuration",
    "the effective resolution is @xmath79 cm at the finest level , corresponding to an equivalent uniform mesh of @xmath80 grid points .",
    "we use fixed boundary conditions at @xmath81 and reflecting boundary conditions at @xmath82 ( consistent with the adopted symmetry ) .",
    "after some exploration of the parameter space , results that provide a good match to observations are obtained with a loop of half length @xmath74 cm , and with a heat pulse of intensity @xmath83 erg  @xmath16 s@xmath58 , gaussian width and center @xmath84  cm and @xmath85 cm , respectively .",
    "the heat pulse is therefore located close the loop footpoint i.e. @xmath86  cm above the transition region .",
    "we now discuss this simulation in some detail .",
    "the evolution of the flare - heated plasma confined in a coronal loop is well known from previous work ( e.g. nagai 1980 , peres et al .",
    "1982 , cheng et al . 1983 , nagai & emslie 1984 , fisher et al .",
    "1985 , macneice 1986 , betta et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , the choice of the parameters and the specific model make our results very similar to those described in reale & orlando ( 2008 ) for the case of heat pulse deposited at the loop footpoints and lasting 180 s. the only difference is that the heating rate is about 5 times larger , leading to a maximum temperature twice as high , i.e. about 20 mk .",
    "since here we focus on the late phases of the flare , we do not enter the details of the initial phases which are similar to those described by reale & orlando ( 2008 ) .",
    "we only mention that the loop is rapidly filled by hot plasma and that the plasma begins to cool down by conduction and radiation as soon as the heat pulse stops , but the density still grows for a few minutes .",
    "the plasma then drains and cools altogether .",
    "[ fig : evol ] illustrates the evolution of the plasma along half of the model loop from 30 to 50 minutes after the start of the heat pulse . during this phase ,",
    "the plasma density at the formation temperature of the lines is in the range @xmath87 , in agreement with the values inferred from spectroscopic analysis of the data ( see sect .  [ diagnostics_results ] ) .",
    "the plasma cools down gradually and uniformly along the loop for about 10 minutes but then it suddenly gets thermally unstable and the temperature drops in about 2 minutes by a factor 10 , from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , in the coronal part of the loop .",
    "the density decreases more gradually and at a constant rate , so that at @xmath90 min the plasma is cold but still relatively dense .",
    "since the plasma is dramatically out of the hydrostatic equilibrium , it begins to drain more rapidly and its downward velocity increases from @xmath91 km / s to @xmath92 km / s .",
    "a front of relatively hotter and denser plasma ( @xmath93 ) develops at the loop footpoints and slowly propagates along the loop .",
    "the trigger of the thermal instability can be explained in terms of the criterion described by field ( 1965 ) : below 1  mk the radiative losses begin to increase for decreasing temperature ( negative slope ) and the density is sufficiently high that the cooling becomes catastrophic .",
    "the presence of the instability is even more clear in the evolution of the loop top temperature .",
    "the temperature at the top of the loop is a good proxy of the loop maximum temperature for most of the time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : max_tn ] shows the loop top temperature and density during the entire duration of the flare .",
    "the heat capacity of the loop is initially very small and the temperature increases very rapidly , but it also saturates as well because of the increased losses due to the highly efficient thermal conduction . after the end of the heat pulse , the temperature decreases regularly ( exponentially ) during most of the first 40 min , and then drops suddenly to @xmath94 k. below this temperature , the plasma is assumed to radiate no more , so the thermal evolution for @xmath95 min is outside the scope of the modeling .",
    "after the temperature drops , the plasma begins to drain more rapidly and the density also decreases more rapidly ( lower panel ) .    to study the degree of departure from equilibrium in a plasma , reale & orlando ( 2008 ) introduced for each element an `` effective temperature '' ( t@xmath96 ) , as the temperature for which the equilibrium ion abundances of the element best approximates the actual values in the plasma .",
    "in case of equilibrium , all elements have the same t@xmath96 and this should equal the electron temperature .",
    "[ fig : max_t ] shows the evolution of t@xmath96 at the loop top for the most important ion species : the ion temperatures substantially differ from @xmath97 only during the earliest phase of the flare ( @xmath98 min ) and do not evolve very differently from @xmath97 in later phases .",
    "we find again some deviations from the ionization equilibrium around the thermal instability ( @xmath99 min ) , because the temperature drops abruptly .",
    "the instability starts from a hotter status ( @xmath100 mk ) for the light elements c , n , and o ions ( when the electron temperature is @xmath101 k ) .",
    "this temperature drop is mainly due to the fact that the thermal instability occurs in a range of temperature in which the he - like ionization state of these light elements is the most populated .",
    "since the temperature @xmath102 is found as the temperature at which the two most populated ionization states fit those assuming equilibrium of ionization , the nei effects together with the fact that he - like ions are the most abundant in a broad range of temperatures lead to the observed jump of @xmath102 .",
    "note also that @xmath102 for o , n , c drop consecutively in time because the corresponding he - like ionization state forms at lower and lower temperatures during the plasma cooling .",
    "although apparently large , the deviations from equilibrium are so concentrated in time that they do not produce strong effect on the visible emission .",
    "the model allows us to predict the light curves of the observed lines .",
    "[ fig : lc1l ] shows them during the development of the thermal instability in the late phase of the flare , both assuming and not assuming ionization equilibrium .",
    "time origin and range have been adjusted to allow a direct comparison with the observed light curves .",
    "[ fig : lc1l ] confirms that the effects of deviations from ionization equilibrium are not important : only the light curves of the coldest lines ( , ) are affected , by being slightly broader , i.e. their decay is slightly slower in the latest phases .",
    "thus , both panels can be compared to observations and they show the same results : first , the time sequence and the relative start time of the light curves of each line are both in very good agreement with observations ( within 1 - 2 min ) , with the exception of the hottest lines ( ) ; and second , the observed light curves are considerably broader than the predicted ones , i.e. both the rise and the decay are slower than modelled .    we have found that the timing and line sequence could not be reproduced with the same accuracy with other model parameters , and in particular longer ( @xmath103 cm ) loops , more ( to a maximum temperature of 25  mk ) or less ( 10  mk ) intense heating , and also a heat pulse deposited at the loop apex . we define the root mean square time distance of the simulated and observed peak between lines as a goodness - of - fit parameter :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the times of the peak of the i - th line light curves measured in the simulation and in the observation , respectively . here",
    "we align the times to be the same for the peak of the line .",
    "we measure @xmath107 over the coolest lines ( from s xi to si iii ) .",
    "we have found that the value of the best - fit model is @xmath108 min , while for all others values between 9 and 50 min .",
    "for the best - fit model , each peak of the ( cool ) model light curves is within 5 min from respective peak of the observed light curves .",
    "indeed , we have found @xmath108 min also from a simulation with a shorter loop @xmath109  cm and maximum temperature of 20 mk .",
    "one more constraint from the observation is the absolute intensity of the line emission . to compute the line intensity from the simulation results we need to make an assumption on the path length @xmath21 along the line of sight . for @xmath74 cm , we find that the path length that matches the measured one is between @xmath110 and @xmath111 cm for the lines marking the thermal instability ( from the warm to the cool ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate of @xmath21 made in section  [ diagnostics_results ] , and it is also compatible with a loop cross - section diameter of the order of 10% of the loop length , as typical of coronal loops .",
    "for the shorter loop ( @xmath112 cm ) the path length is larger ( @xmath113 cm ) but still well within the range of values found in section  [ diagnostics_results ] . in this case",
    ", the flaring structure would have more the aspect of a flaring loop arcade .",
    "since we have reasons to believe that the flare occurs in a multi - structured loops , both scenarios seem possibile .",
    "morevover , these loop lengths are compatible with the vertical height corresponding to the sumer slit position above the limb .",
    "overall , we can say that the loop length , and the heat intensity and position are relatively well constrained and provide a reasonably self - consistent scenario .",
    "none of the explored single loop models has been able to reproduce the observed `` broad '' light curves , i.e. the observed light curves change more slowly than those obtained from the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the agreement is further improved if we assume that the flaring region is not a single monolithic loop , but it is substructured into a bundle of loops or loop strands , each of the same length as the loop we modeled .",
    "each component is heated at a different time , and the time distribution of the heating pulses is assumed to be gaussian with @xmath114  minute width . we derive the related line light curves simply as the convolution of the single loop light curves with the ( same ) gaussian .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcok ] and compared to observations .",
    "the predicted light curves are now in closer agreement as far as time sequence , time evolution and time scale are concerned .",
    "we are unable to , and do not pretend to , constrain the number of loops or strands .",
    "the convolution with the gaussian means that at any time the line intensities are the same relative to the others ( i.e. the ratio is unchanged ) .",
    "so there is only a scale factor that changes in time , which is a volume factor .",
    "this implies that all loops / strands are heated in the same way , and only the number of heated loops / strands first progressively increases and then progressively decreases .",
    "we can not claim that this is the only way to produce this effect , but we can certainly say that this is a very simple way to do that , with very few free parameters ( only the rate of involved strands ) .    although fine details such as the asymmetry between rise and decay of the light curves can still be improved , overall we can conclude that this agreement is evidence of a thermally unstable plasma confined in a substructured loop system undergoing cooling after a flare .",
    "it is worth noting that the thermal instability occurs at @xmath90 min after the heat pulse , while the observation indicates that it should occur @xmath115 min after the start of the flare ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the flare start time and the start of the heat pulse , as well as the disagreement in the time profile of hot lines , may be better resolved if the model can produce a temperature time profile that at first decreases from 20  mk more rapidly but stays longer ( by @xmath11620 min ) above @xmath1161  mk before going into thermal instability .",
    "this appears to be limited by the current setting of the model for the energy balance .",
    "this work aims at explaining the peculiar light curves of several uv lines in the late phases of a flare observed with soho / sumer . in particular",
    ", our target is the appearance of several spectral lines emitted by plasma in a wide range of temperature in a relatively short time .",
    "the scope of this work is modeling the post - flare phase and therefore we do not attempt at reproducing the initial phases of the flare .",
    "we show that light curves are well reproduced by the hydrodynamic evolution of flaring plasma confined in a closed loop system triggered by a strong heat pulse .",
    "in particular , the sudden , almost simultaneous appearance of the emission of chromospheric and transition region ions formed more than one order of magnitude apart in temperature is due to the fact that late in the cooling phase the plasma becomes thermally unstable , because the radiative losses increase rapidly below 1 mk , and its temperature drops rapidly by one order of magnitude in a couple of minutes along most of the loop . a good relative timing and order of appearance of the light curves of each line is obtained with a standard flare loop model considering a loop half - length of @xmath117 cm , and a heat pulse lasting 3  min and deposited in the corona , close to the loop footpoints .",
    "the heating rate is such as to have a flare maximum temperature of about 20  mk .",
    "better agreement of the duration of the light curve of each line is obtained if we assume that the flare occurs in a bundle of subloops of equal length ( a stranded loop or a loop arcade ) .",
    "if each substructure is assumed to be heated at a different time , the predicted light curves can be lengthened to match the observed ones .",
    "this is consistent with the slit intercepting several concentric arches that undergo independently the same evolution , so that we see the envelope of this close sequence of events .",
    "the time scale of the distribution of the events is about 8 min , that indicates a propagation speed of the trigger signal of @xmath118 km / s over a length scale of @xmath119 cm .",
    "this result might be consistent with the presence of fine heat substructuring during flares ( e.g. antiochos & krall 1979 , reeves & warren 2002 , warren 2006 ) .",
    "the occurrence of the thermal instability is a necessary ingredient to explain the observations .",
    "however , the effects of such instability on the ion fractions of the major elements are rather limited , contrarily to our initial expectations .",
    "the reason of such limited departures is the relatively large density of the cooling plasma , which shortens the ionization and recombination times scales enough to allow the plasma to efficiently adjust its ionization status to the rapidly decreasing electron temperature ( e.g. golub _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) .",
    "we do not reproduce all the details of the observations .",
    "in particular , the light curves of the hot lines are not well reproduced , and probably would need a more complete analysis of the entire flare event , which is not the target of this study .",
    "the main limitation of the present work is the lack of spatial information on the flaring region , and better constraints on the heating location and timing , and on the properties of the flaring loops systems , can be obtained by combining the present modeling with flares observed with the eve spectrometer and the aia imaging system on the sdo .",
