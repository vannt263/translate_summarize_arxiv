    "there is a growing interest in the scalar field in the cosmological situations because of its important role played in the inflationary universe scenario@xcite .",
    "there the expansion of the universe is totally governed by the behavior of the scalar field . in this paper",
    "we would like to make a comment on the behavior of the universe dominated by the scalar field from the point of view so far not paid much attention .",
    "namely we shall be interested in the universe with nonminimally coupled scalar field @xmath6 in some special circumstances which will be explained in short .",
    "the nonminimal coupling is described by the form @xmath7 in the lagrangian where @xmath8 is the spacetime curvature and @xmath0 the coupling constant .",
    "minimal coupling has @xmath9 .",
    "we choose the convention that the conformal invariance yields @xmath10 .",
    "particle physics do not specify any particular value for the coupling constant @xmath0 , so there is no a priori reason to restrict our attention to a particular value for the coupling .",
    "there have been many studies on the effect of this coupling on the expansion behaviour and on the chaotic inflationary scenario .",
    "it has been shown that the original chaotic senario@xcite does work only for a limited range of the coupling constant such as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "fakir and unruh@xcite showed a possibility to have a successiful senario of chaotic inflation with a large negative coupling constant . on the other hand futamase and",
    "maeda@xcite have pointed out that there will be two critical values @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the scalar field in the range @xmath14 and there is no isotropic solution with flat and closed spatial curvature if the scalar field is larger than @xmath15 .",
    "moreover starobinskiy@xcite and futamase et al@xcite have shown that the anisotropic shear diverges as the scalar field approaches to @xmath12 for almost all initial configurations @xmath16 and thus the closed as well as flat universe starting from such initial configurations does not lead to our present isotropic universe . therefore no serious attention has been paid for the situation with such initial configurations for the scalar field .",
    "however some of the recent observations do suggest the possibility of open universe@xcite @xcite and there are also studies to explore the possibility to have open inflationary scenario in theoretical side@xcite . in this situation",
    "we think it may be interesting to consider the case of open universe with nonminimally coupled scalar field under the condition @xmath17 because the possibility to have an isotropic expansion in this situations is not excluded and thus there will be no a priori reason to reject such a situation .",
    "it turns out that such a universe has remarkably rich behavior such that the universe recollapses to a singularity in a finite time . in this sense",
    "the effect of nonminimal coupling constant is similar with that of negative cosmological constant .",
    "more than that there are situations where the universe show rebouncing behavior before the final collapse .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give general discussions including a short review about the de sitter universe for reader s convenience and about nonminimal coupling . in sec .",
    "3 we turn our attention to the case of open universe ( @xmath4 ) . there",
    "we will find some very interesting behavior of such a universe .",
    "finally summary and remarks are give in sec .",
    "we briefly review the expansion behavior of de sitter universe . in this model",
    "the cosmological constant is assumed to be @xmath18 without matter . the space - time is described to be the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric of the universe depending on the curvature constant @xmath21 , 0 or @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the einstein equations is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "[ fig : fig_desitter ] , this diagram shows the typical behavior of cosmological scale - factor in the de sitter universe .",
    "those behavior are apparently different in the case of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are curves in the case of cosmological constant @xmath25 with curvature @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . in the inflationary scenario , the vacuum energy of the scalar field ( or inflaton ) @xmath6 plays the same role with the cosmological constant @xmath33 .",
    "the solid line ( the lowest line labeled @xmath34 ) is curve in the case of @xmath26 with @xmath32 , which is the only case of solution in de sitter universe with @xmath26 . here",
    "the universe necessarily recollapses and thus the spacetime has a finite extent in time in the future .",
    "those are limited by the value of cosmological constant @xmath35 .",
    "though there are some interesting features in this case , it is usually regarded as no physical meaning .",
    "we consider the total action of einstein gravity and a real scalar field @xmath6 coupled non - minimally with the spacetime curvature .",
    "@xmath36 ,    \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the coupling constant between the scalar field @xmath6 and the space - time curvature @xmath8 . @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath37 correspond to minimal and conformal couplings , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is the potential for the scalar field .    from the above expression",
    ", we find that an effective gravitational constant @xmath39 where @xmath40 thus it gives us a negative effective gravitational constant for a reasonable choice of @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction it has been shown that the anisotropic shear diverges as @xmath6 approaches to @xmath44 in the cases of flat and closed geometry@xcite .",
    "when the coupling constant is in the range @xmath45 , there is another singular point @xmath46 this may be seen from the structure of the hamiltonian constrain@xcite . @xmath47",
    "the constraint also indicates that there is no isotropic classical solution for @xmath48 in the closed or flat universe .",
    "only possibility to have an isotropic spacetime for @xmath49 is the case where the spatial curvature is negative @xmath50 which we will consider in detail in the following section .",
    "we now consider an open isotropic universe in the presence of a nonminimally coupled scalar field . when we restrict our consideration in frw spacetime denoted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) , the einstein equations are found to be @xmath51    = \\frac{8\\pi}{3 } \\left [ \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}^2}{2 } + 6\\xi\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\phi}\\phi + v(\\phi ) \\right ] ,      \\label{eq : einstein}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "the scalar field equation is found to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is effective potential and its gradient is written as @xmath55   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we assume @xmath56 with @xmath57 as a typical example .",
    "we shall then numerically solve the above set of equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) and ( [ eq : phi - field ] ) for the case @xmath58 .",
    "we present the results of calculation with @xmath59(@xmath60 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we notice that there is upper limit for the initial value about 30 in this case otherwise one can not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) at the initial time .",
    "fig.[fig : fig_2 ] shows evolutions of the scalar field ( upper figure ) and the scale factor ( lower figure ) .",
    "those are scaled in planck unit .",
    "the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are solutions with the initial value of scalar field as @xmath1 = 10 , 5 , 2 , respectively .",
    "these @xmath4 open universe look like @xmath4 open anti - de sitter universe with negative cosmological constant @xmath26 in fig.[fig : fig_desitter ] .",
    "we also draw the solid curve ( labeled @xmath34 ) in the case of @xmath63 with @xmath1 = 5 under @xmath64=+1 closed universe for comparison .",
    "this is a most popular case known as _",
    "chaotic inflationary universe_@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : fig_3 ] is the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] , but the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are solutions with the initial value of scalar field as @xmath1 = 5 , 20 , 25 , respectively . in the case of @xmath1",
    "= 5 , the scalar field @xmath6 seems to be blocked by barrier of the critical value @xmath60 so as not to go through it for a long time , and then the scalar field @xmath6 blows up to infinitely large value .",
    "this behavior may be understood by noticing that the gradient of the effective potential diverges as the scalar field approaches to @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of scale factor looks like that of de sitter universe with @xmath32 and @xmath26 , which necessarily come to collapse into zero ( @xmath65 ) in a finite time . in the case of large initial values such as @xmath66 ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath6 decreases first to near the @xmath2 , keep a value for a while , and blow up go to infinitely large value .",
    "then the evolution of scale factor experiences a bounce era and goes to recollapse in the end .",
    "we investigated the evolutionary behavior of an open isotropic universe dominate by a nonminimally coupled scalar field in the range @xmath67 .",
    "we found by numerical analysis that the scalar field can not cross the singular point @xmath2 and instead diverges to infinity .",
    "according to the behavior of the scalar field , the expansion of the universe is turn around and is collapsing to singularity .",
    "this behavior is similar to an open de sitter universe with a negative cosmological constant eq .",
    "( [ eq : de - sitter ] ) .",
    "this could be understood by writing the expansion equation in the following form .",
    "@xmath68 }                             { ( { \\phi^2}/{\\phi_c^2 } -1 ) }                      -   k \\,\\,e^{-2\\alpha}\\ ] ] thus the energy density of the scalar field plays a role of a negative cosmological constant in a sense . if the cosmological constant @xmath69 is not zero , the effective cosmological constant @xmath70 is found to be @xmath71 it is found that non positive effective cosmological constant @xmath70 appears even if @xmath72 in some range of the scalar field @xmath73 .",
    "thus it might gives us a possible mechanism to reduce the cosmological constant to a small value .",
    "there are also other solutions which shows a rebouncing behavior before the eventual collapse to the singularity .",
    "it seems to us that this kind of behavior has not been known before . just after the bounce",
    "the expansion is accelerated .",
    "then it might be possible to have a new open inflationary scenario by adjusting parameters ( initial value of the scalar field and the coupling constant ) .",
    "it also interesting to consider how anisotropic shear behaves in the singular point in our open universe .",
    "our preliminary result show that the anisotropy diverges also as one approaches to @xmath44 also in the open universe .",
