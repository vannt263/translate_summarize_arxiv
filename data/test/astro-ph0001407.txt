    "modeling of multi - wavelength lightcurves reveals that the effective diameter of the adc is @xmath9  cm , about half that of the optically emitting disk , and that structure in the disk can reach a height of @xmath10  cm ( white & holt @xcite ; mason & crdova @xcite ; hellier & mason @xcite ; puchnarewicz et al .",

    "this is in contrast to previous results , where the eclipse depths measured by exosat and _ ginga _ both showed a similar strong dependence on energy ( hellier et al .",

    "eclipse arrival times using recent bepposax mecs , asca and rxte proportional counter array data have been determined .",
    "since there are substantial gaps in the data and the count rates low , the bepposax and asca lightcurves were first folded on the 5.5706  hr period of hellier & smale ( @xcite ) . a model consisting of a gaussian and",
    "a constant was then fit to the eclipse phases ( @xmath261.05 ) of the folded lightcurves .",
    "the arrival time of the eclipse was then assigned to the eclipse which occurred closest to mid - time of the observation .",
    "for the mecs the uncertainty on the arrival time was obtained directly from the fit .",
    "data from the 4 asca instruments were analyzed independently and the uncertainties in the arrival times were derived from the spreads in the obtained values , while the arrival times were defined as the averages from the 4 instruments . the rxte observation was made between 1996",
    "september 26 16:03 and september 27 07:19  utc .",
    "since only one eclipse was observed , the gaussian and a constant model was fit directly to the eclipse interval in the lightcurve .",
    "the uncertainty in the rxte arrival time was estimated by comparing results obtained using ( 1 ) a range of eclipse phases around those given above using the gaussian and constant model and ( 2 ) including a linear term in the above model and fitting over the same range of phases .",
    "the spread in values obtained using these two methods was larger than the uncertainties obtained from the individual fits , and so was adopted as an estimate of the overall uncertainty .",
    "the fit results , which extend the measurements in hellier & smale ( @xcite ) by some 5  yrs , or 8000 cycles , are summarized in table [ tab : eclipse_times ] .",

    "the spectrum is unusually complex and can not be fit by any of the usual models applied to lmxrb such as a cutoff power - law and blackbody unless an unusually strong low - energy emission feature is included .",
    "a good fit is obtained to the 0.340  kev bepposax spectrum with the combination of a comptonization component and a blackbody together with an fe - k emission line and an absorption edge .",
    "the same model provides reasonable fits to asca sis spectra with a similar absorption feature being required .",
    "there are at least three highly unusual features of the  spectrum .",
    "the first , also pointed out by white et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , is that the continuum is much harder than is typical of similar luminosity lmxrbs , where @xmath17 is usually 1.52.5 .",
    "the spectrum scattered in an adc is expected to resemble the original , unless the optical depth is large .",
    "the second is the extremely large contribution of the blackbody component ( @xmath040% of the total ) , whereas fits to luminous lmxrb indicate the presence of blackbodies with typical luminosities of 1634% of the non - thermal component ( white et al .",
    "however , we note that another lmxrb , the x - ray dip source xb  1746 - 371 located in the globular cluster ngc6441 , also recently been found to have a strong blackbody - like component which contributes 88% of the 110  kev flux ( parmar et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also guainazzi et al .",
    "the blackbody component most probably originates in an optically thick boundary layer between the accretion disk and the neutron star surface , or from the neutron star itself .",
    "it is therefore unlikely to be observed directly in  and so it is surprising that it appears so bright in comparison with the non - thermal component .",
    "the third unusual aspect of the spectrum is the presence of the strong low - energy feature , which can be modeled as an absorption edge .",
    "the fact that a similar component is also seen in the two asca observations implies that this is a stable feature of the spectrum , but not necessarily that it is correctly modeled",
    ". however , its nature is highly uncertain .",
    "the energy corresponds to k - edges of highly ionized ne  x and neutral mg , or to an l - edge of moderately ionized fe .",
    "surprisingly , no strong ( @xmath4 ) fe - k or ( @xmath5 ) o - k edges are evident in the spectrum .",
    "models for the spectrum of  which involve a significant comptonized component appear plausible .",
    "a plasma with kt@xmath30510  kev and a @xmath31 of @xmath192226 is required .",
    "these values imply a comptonization parameter @xmath32 of @xmath192540 .",
    "values of y@xmath3312 imply that the emerging spectrum will be saturated and have a wien - like shape ( e.g. , titarchuk @xcite ) .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that when the bepposax spectra of a number of lmxrb located in globular clusters are fit with the same continuum model as applied here ( a blackbody and comptt ) , then the derived values of @xmath31 and @xmath34 are respectively correlated and anti - correlated with the source luminosity .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that these correlations may be qualitatively explained if the x - ray emission at the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the neutron star surface is proportional to the accretion rate .",
    "if this results in an increase in the comptonizing plasma optical depth this would allow compton cooling to become more efficient , yielding a lower comptonizing electron temperature . if the intrinsic luminosity of  is assumed to be @xmath16  erg  s@xmath14 ( see sect .  1 ) , then the values derived here using bepposax for @xmath31 and @xmath34 are in good agreement with the relations derived from the study of the globular cluster lmxrb x - ray sources .",
    "the overall x - ray spectrum of  remains poorly understood .",
    "in particular , calculations by e.g. , ko & kallman ( @xcite ) and kallman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that photo - ionized adc should be a rich source of line emission , which does not appear to be the case here as only a moderate ew fe - k line is seen .",
    "vrtilek et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discuss the situation where an x - ray source is viewed at high inclination through a moderate optical depth adc .",
    "they predict both a deep fe - k edge and a prominant k-@xmath17 emission line - again neither of which are seen .",
    "thus the  spectrum can not be easily understood in terms of current models of x - ray production and reprocessing in adcs and we await future high quality measurements to shed more light on this complex spectrum .    the bepposax satellite is a joint italian and dutch programme .",
    "we thank the referee , martin still , for helpful comments and ken ebisawa , koji mukai , and the staff of the bepposax science data center for assistance .",
