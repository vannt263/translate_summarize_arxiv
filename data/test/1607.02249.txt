    "spectrum scarcity and ever - increasing data rate requirements are the two main motivating factors behind introducing carrier aggregation ( ca ) in modern wireless communication systems , such as 3gpp lte - advanced @xcite . in ca transmission , multiple component carriers ( ccs ) at different rf frequencies are adopted simultaneously , either within the same rf band ( intraband ca ) , or at different rf bands ( interband ca ) @xcite . while interband ca naturally leads to a _ non - contiguous transmit spectrum _ , this can also happen in the intraband ca case when the adopted component carriers are located in a non - contiguous manner . adopting non -",
    "contiguous ca provides lots of flexibility in rf spectrum use , but also poses substantial challenges in the transmitter design , especially in lower - cost devices such as lte - advanced user equipment ( ue ) .",
    "moreover , multicarrier type modulations with very large peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) are used in most state - of - the - art wireless communication systems . when combined with noncontiguous transmission schemes and high power - efficiency requirements , controlling the transmitter unwanted emissions due to power amplifier ( pa )",
    "nonlinearity becomes a true challenge @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a comparison of different transmitter architectures for ca based transmission schemes was presented , showing that it is more power efficient to combine the ccs before the pa , and thus use only a single pa , instead of having a separate pa for each cc .",
    "this is also technically feasible , especially in the intraband ca case .",
    "the power savings can be quite significant since the overall transmitter efficiency is dominated by the pa @xcite , and is particularly critical in mobile terminals and other lower - cost devices , such as small - cell base - stations , with limited computing and cooling capabilities @xcite .",
    "however , the power efficiency gained from using a single pa for all ccs comes at the expense of more severe unwanted emissions , stemming from the pa nonlinear characteristics , that can occur at adjacent channels or bands , or even at own receiver band in fdd transceiver case @xcite .",
    "the levels of different unwanted emissions are , in general , regulated by the standardization bodies and itu - r @xcite .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that in the context of lte - advanced mobile transmitter with noncontiguous ca or multicluster type transmission , the pa nonlinearities lead to spurious emissions that can seriously violate the given spectrum and spurious emission limits if not properly controlled @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in fdd devices , in addition to violating the general spurious emission limits , the generated spurious components can also overlap with the device s own receive band , causing own receiver desensitization @xcite .",
    "one obvious solution to decrease the levels of unwanted emissions is to back off the transmit power from its saturation region . in 3gpp ue terminology , this is known as maximum power reduction ( mpr ) , and mpr values up to 16 db are allowed in some use cases for mobile terminals @xcite .",
    "however , this approach will end up yielding a significantly lower pa efficiency as well as a substantial reduction in the network coverage .",
    "there is thus a clear need for alternative pa linearization solutions which do not have such drastic adverse effects .",
    "digital predistortion ( dpd ) is , in general , one of the most effective solutions for mitigating transmitter nonlinear distortion .",
    "there have been substantial research efforts in the past 20 years in developing ever more efficient and elaborate dpd techniques , mostly for high - end macro base - station type of devices .",
    "the conventional dpd approaches seek to linearize the full composite transmit signal , and we thus refer to such solutions as full - band dpd in this article . there have also been a handful of recent works on efficient concurrent linearization techniques for multi - band transmitters that employ only a single pa @xcite .",
    "these works assume that the component carriers are separated by a large distance such that the spurious emissions are filtered out by the transmit rf filter , and hence linearization of only the main carriers is pursued .",
    "first , the emission limits in the spurious region are generally stricter than in the spectral regrowth region around the component carriers , and are thus more easily violated .",
    "this has been recognized also in 3gpp recently , in the context of intraband noncontiguous carrier aggregation @xcite . moreover , even in interband carrier aggregation scenarios in fdd devices , some of the spurious components can be hitting the own rx band causing own receiver desensitization @xcite .",
    "second , by concentrating the linearization efforts to the most critical spurious emissions only , the processing and instrumentation requirements can be significantly relaxed , thus potentially facilitating the dpd processing also in mobile terminals and other lower - cost devices .",
    "this applies not only to the dpd main path processing complexity but also to the feedback receiver instrumentation complexity which can also be substantially reduced .",
    "there have been some recent studies in the literature that consider the mitigation of the spurious emissions explicitly . in @xcite",
    ", such processing was added to complement a concurrent linearization system while assuming a frequency - flat pa response within the spurious sub - band . in @xcite ,",
    "the dpd parameter estimation was done offline , based on extracting the quasi - memoryless pa parameters using large - signal network analyzer ( lsna ) measurements , and covering up to fifth - order processing . in @xcite ,",
    "a memoryless least - squares fit between the observed intermodulation distortion ( imd ) at the considered sub - band and certain basis functions was performed .",
    "the basis functions were generated using a wideband composite carrier baseband equivalent signal , followed by sub - band filtering , implying a very high sample rate and processing complexity , especially for widely spaced carriers .",
    "the estimated and regenerated imd was then applied at the pa input , oppositely phased , such that it is canceled at the pa output .    in this article",
    ", we extend the elementary third - order im3 sub - band dpd solution , proposed by the authors in @xcite , in two ways .",
    "first , the third - order im3 sub - band dpd is extended to incorporate higher - order processing based on explicit modeling of the higher - order spurious components at the im3 sub - band .",
    "this will enhance the im3 spurious emission suppression considerably .",
    "furthermore , we also extend the sub - band dpd solution to include higher - order sub - bands , i.e. , im5 , im7 , etc .",
    ", thus offering more flexibility and linearization capabilities beyond the basic im3 sub - band .",
    "all the proposed solutions are derived for wideband nonlinear pas with memory .",
    "furthermore , we also formulate novel decorrelation - based parameter estimation methods , covering both sample - adaptive and block - adaptive learning rules , to efficiently identify the needed dpd parameters with low complexity .",
    "the proposed learning solutions are also shown to offer better performance than the earlier proposed third - order or fifth - order inverse based methods .",
    "we also provide comprehensive simulation and rf measurement results , using a commercial lte - advanced mobile pa , to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in real world scenarios .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : section [ sec : dpd_modeling ] presents the mathematical modeling of the different considered spurious components at different sub - bands , produced by a nonlinear pa with memory . stemming from this modeling , also the corresponding core processing principles of the proposed dpd solutions at different sub - bands are formulated .",
    "then , section [ sec : dpd_learning ] presents the proposed dpd parameter learning solutions , covering both sample - adaptive and block - adaptive decorrelation solutions at different sub - bands .",
    "section [ sec : complexity ] addresses then different implementation alternatives of the proposed sub - band dpd concept , and also analyzes the computing complexity of the sub - band dpd in terms of the number of floating point operations together with some hardware complexity aspects .",
    "finally , sections [ sec : simulations and measurements ] and [ sec : rf measurement results ] report comprehensive simulation and rf measurement results , evidencing excellent spurious emission suppression in different realistic scenarios .",
    "in this manuscript , we assume a practical case of non - contiguous carrier aggregation with two component carriers . when such noncontiguous dual - carrier signal is applied at the pa input , the pa nonlinearity leads to intermodulation distortion at different sub - bands , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : psd ] . assuming a cc separation of @xmath0 , in addition to the spectral regrowth around the main carriers , intermodulation between the two ccs yields strong imd at integer multiples of @xmath0 from the main ccs . in this article",
    ", we refer to the intermodulation ( i m ) sub - bands located at @xmath1 from the main ccs as the _",
    "im3 sub - bands_. similarly , the _ im5 sub - bands _ are located at @xmath2 from the main ccs , and so on . in general , each i m sub - band includes nonlinear distortion components of different orders as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] .",
    "for example , in the case of a seventh - order pa nonlinearity , the im3 sub - band contains third , fifth and seventh - order nonlinearities , while the im5 sub - band contains fifth and seventh - order components .    in this section",
    ", we start with the fundamental modeling of the nonlinear distortion at the im3 sub - band as a concrete example . stemming from that modeling",
    ", we then formulate the basic processing of the proposed im3 sub - band dpd .",
    "after that , the modeling is extended to cover the nonlinear distortion components at the higher - order i m sub - bands , followed by the corresponding higher - order sub - band dpd processing . the actual parameter estimation and learning algorithms for the proposed sub - band dpd structures",
    "are then presented in details in section [ sec : dpd_learning ] . in all the modeling and developments ,",
    "we adopt the widely - used wideband parallel hammerstein ( ph ) pa model @xcite to describe the fundamental nonlinear behavior of the pa , as it has been shown to model accurately the measured nonlinear behavior of different classes of true pas .",
    "the modeling is carried out at composite baseband equivalent level , where the two component carriers are assumed to be separated by @xmath3 .",
    "the composite baseband equivalent input and output signals of the @xmath4 order parallel hammerstein pa model , with monomial nonlinearities and fir branch filters , respectively , read    @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the baseband component carrier signals , @xmath8 denotes the ph branch filter impulse responses of order @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the convolution operator .",
    "intermodulation between the two component carriers leads to the appearance of imd components at @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .",
    ", as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] for the corresponding rf spectrum .",
    "@xmath13 here , @xmath14 denote the baseband equivalent impulse responses corresponding to the wideband ph pa model filters @xmath8 , evaluated at the im3@xmath15 sub - bands , formally defined as    @xmath16 with @xmath17 denoting an ideal low pass filtering operation with a passband width @xmath18 times the bandwidth of the wider cc .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( 3 ) are the corresponding @xmath21 order static nonlinear ( snl ) basis functions , related to the nonlinear distortion at the im3 + and im3- sub - bands , respectively .",
    "assuming then an @xmath22 order pa model ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) , as a concrete high - order example , the im3 + sub - band basis functions read    @xmath24 the corresponding basis functions for the im3- sub - band , i.e. , @xmath20 , can be obtained by simply interchanging @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the above expressions .",
    "next , these behavioral modeling results are utilized to formulate the proposed im3 sub - band dpd concept , specifically tailored to suppress the distortion at the im3 sub - band .          for presentation purposes ,",
    "we focus here on suppressing the spurious emissions at the im3 + sub - band , while the corresponding emissions at the im3- sub - band can also be easily mitigated using a very similar structure with minor changes as will be elaborated later in section [ sec : higher - order dpd principle ] .",
    "the key idea of the sub - band dpd concept is to inject a proper additional low - power cancellation signal , with structural similarity to ( [ eq : im3_output_mem ] ) and located at @xmath25 , into the pa input , such that the level of the im3 + term at the pa output is reduced .",
    "now , stemming from the imd structure in ( [ eq : im3_output_mem ] ) , an appropriate digital injection signal can be obtained by adopting the im3 + basis functions @xmath19 in ( [ eq : im3_basisfunctions1])-([eq : im3_basisfunctions5 ] ) , combined with proper filtering using a bank of sub - band dpd filters @xmath26 .",
    "incorporating such sub - band dpd processing with polynomial order @xmath27 , the composite baseband equivalent pa input signal reads    @xmath28e^{j 2\\pi \\frac{3 f_{if}}{f_s } n } \\label{eq : pa_in_with_im3_dpd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , and in the continuation , we use @xmath29 variables to indicate sub - band dpd processing and the corresponding predistorted signals .",
    "this dpd processing principle is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sub - band dpd ] at a conceptual level , where the tx / rx duplexer filters are omitted for simplicity of the presentation since they do not directly impact the sub - band dpd processing or learning .",
    "similar convention is followed also in other figures .",
    "different implementation alternatives as well as the parameter learning and feedback receiver aspects are addressed in more details in sections iii and iv .",
    "the direct substitution of ( [ eq : pa_in ] ) in ( [ eq : pa_out_mem ] ) leads to the appearance of spurious intermodulation terms also at higher - order i m sub - bands , in addition to the previously considered im3 sub - bands , as illustrated already in fig . [",
    "fig : psd ] .",
    "these higher - order sub - band emissions can also be harmful , since they can violate the emission limits , cause own receiver desensitization , or both .",
    "thus , developing a sub - band dpd solution that can tackle also the distortion at these higher - order i m sub - bands with feasible complexity is important .",
    "similar to the above im3 + sub - band developments , we next extract the imd terms at the higher - order i m sub - bands .",
    "the baseband equivalent imd terms at the im5 + , im7 + , im9 + , and im11 + sub - bands , as concrete examples , can be extracted using ( [ eq : pa_in ] ) and ( [ eq : pa_out_mem ] ) , interpreted at proper sub - bands , yielding    @xmath30 in the above models , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 denote the baseband equivalent impulse responses corresponding to the wideband pa model filters @xmath8 in ( 2 ) , evaluated at the im5 + , im7 + , im9 + , and im11 + sub - bands , respectively .",
    "these are formally obtained similar to ( 4 ) but replacing @xmath35 with either @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath21 order basis functions at the these higher - order i m sub - bands , denoted by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , and assuming again an @xmath22 order ph pa model , read    @xmath44 the corresponding baseband equivalent imd terms at the negative i m sub - bands can be obtained by simply interchanging @xmath6 and @xmath7 in ( [ eq : imd_basisfunctions1])-([eq : imd_basisfunctions2 ] ) . then , stemming from the distortion structure in ( [ eq : im5_output])-([eq : im11_output ] ) , and adopting similar ideology as in the previous im3 sub - band dpd case , a natural injection signal for suppressing the spur components at higher - order i m sub - bands can be obtained by properly filtering and combining the above higher - order sub - band basis functions .",
    "the sub - band specific filters for the @xmath21 order basis functions are denoted with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . incorporating such dpd processing with dpd polynomial order @xmath27 , and aggregating at the same time parallel sub - band dpds simultaneously for the im3 + , im5 + , and im7 + sub - bands ,",
    "as a concrete example , the composite baseband equivalent pa input signal now reads    @xmath49e^{j 2\\pi \\frac{3 f_{if}}{f_s } n } \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\left[\\sum_{\\substack{p=5 \\\\",

    "this is addressed in detail in the next section .",
    "in this section , based on the previous spurious component modeling and the proposed sub - band dpd principle , we formulate computing feasible and highly efficient estimation algorithms for learning and optimizing the sub - band dpd filter coefficients such that the spurious emissions are minimized at the considered i m sub - bands .",
    "we start by deriving some analytical reference solutions , taking the third - order im3 sub - band dpd as a simple and tractable example , in order to demonstrate that minimizing the im3 power is essentially identical to decorrelating the im3 observation against the corresponding sub - band dpd basis functions .",
    "then , both sample - adaptive and block - adaptive decorrelation based learning rules are devised , covering the general cases of higher - order processing with memory at im3 and higher - order i m sub - bands .      in this subsection",
    ", we derive three analytical reference solutions for calculating the im3 sub - band dpd coefficients .",
    "the considered approaches are the third - order inverse solution , also adopted in @xcite , the im3 power minimization solution , and the analytical im3 decorrelation - based solution . to keep the analytical developments simple and tractable",
    ", we consider a simplified case with a third - order memoryless im3 + sub - band dpd and a third - order memoryless pa . the actual sample - adaptive and block - adaptive decorrelation based learning solutions , devised later in this section , are formulated for the general cases of higher - order processing with memory .    now , starting with the dual carrier signal in ( [ eq : pa_in ] ) , and limiting the study to the simplified case of a third - order memoryless im3 + sub - band dpd and a third - order memoryless pa , the basic signal models are given by ( [ eq : thirdorderanalysis_1])-([eq : thirdorderanalysis ] ) .",
    "@xmath50 here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the memoryless pa model parameters , @xmath53 denotes the memoryless sub - band dpd parameter to be optimized , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to the baseband equivalent pa output at the positive im3 sub - band without and with sub - band dpd , respectively .",
    "now , as ( [ eq : thirdorderanalysis ] ) clearly shows , the im3 sub - band distortion at the pa output , with dpd adopted , depends directly on , and can thus be controlled by , the dpd coefficient @xmath53 . in the well - known _ third - order inverse solution",
    "_ , the dpd parameter @xmath53 is selected such that the third - order term in ( [ eq : thirdorderanalysis ] ) is canceled , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding solution , denoted by @xmath57 , thus reads    @xmath58 however , this will not remove all the distortion , because higher - order terms will be created due to the predistortion , as shown in ( [ eq : thirdorderanalysis ] ) .",
    "a more elaborate method for selecting the dpd parameter @xmath53 is the one that minimizes the power of the total im3 sub - band signal , @xmath55 , referred to as the _ minimum im3 power _ or",
    "_ minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) _ solution in the continuation . for notational convenience ,",
    "we define the so - called error signal as @xmath59 , as with ideal predistortion the im3 sub - band signal would be zero , and thus the optimization means minimizing the power of this error signal .",
    "the detailed derivation of the optimum dpd parameter which minimizes the mean squared error @xmath60 $ ] is given in appendix a , yielding @xmath61^*}{\\left[|f_1|^2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{42 } + 4 \\mathbb{r}(f_1 f_3^*)({{\\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{62 } + { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{44 } )   + 4 |f_3|^2 ( { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{46 } + 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{64 } + { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{82})\\right]^ * } , \\label{eq : mmse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 refers to the products of the cc signals higher - order moments of the form @xmath63 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}[|x_2|^j]$ ] , while @xmath64 $ ] denotes the statistical expectation operator .",
    "as will be shown with concrete examples in section v , this mmse solution provides better linearization performance compared to the third - order inverse solution .",
    "however , as shown in ( [ eq : mmse ] ) , the analytical mmse solution requires the knowledge of various higher - order moments of the cc signals .",
    "furthermore , the above solution is valid only in the case of a memoryless third - order nonlinear system , beyond which obtaining an analytical expression for the dpd coefficients becomes overly tedious . .",
    "the analytical reference solution for the decorrelation - based sub - band dpd structure is obtained by setting the correlation between the error signal , @xmath65 , and the third - order basis function , @xmath66 , to zero , i.e. , @xmath67 = 0 $ ] .",
    "then , through straight - forward algebraic manipulations , the decorrelation - based dpd coefficient , denoted by @xmath68 , can be shown to read    @xmath69 assuming then , for simplicity , that the cc baseband equivalents are complex gaussians , ( [ eq : alpha_0 ] ) simplifies to    @xmath70 where @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 ^ 2 $ ] are the variances of the two ccs @xcite .    a clear advantage of the decorrelation - based approach compared to the earlier mmse solution lies in the simple and straightforward adaptive filtering based practical computing solutions , sketched initially in @xcite for simple third - order processing at im3 , which do not require any prior knowledge about signal moments or any other parameters .",
    "furthermore , opposed to the mmse solution , the decorrelation based approach can be easily extended to include higher - order nonlinearities and memory effects , at both the im3 sub - band as well as the other higher - order i m sub - bands , as will be described in details in the next subsection .          in this subsection , we provide the actual sample - adaptive learning rules for both im3 and higher - order i m sub - band dpd structures with memory , whose basic operating principles were described in section ii . to facilitate the learning , we assume a feedback or observation receiver measuring the particular i m sub - band whose sub - band dpd filter coefficients are currently under learning .",
    "notice that opposed to classical wideband dpd principles , where a wideband observation receiver is typically needed , a more narrowband receiver is sufficient here since only the particular i m sub - band is observed . as both the im3 and the higher - order i m sub - band dpds are based on multiple strongly correlated basis functions , given in ( [ eq : im3_basisfunctions1])-([eq : im3_basisfunctions5 ] ) and ( [ eq : imd_basisfunctions1])-([eq : imd_basisfunctions2 ] ) , respectively , we start by introducing a basis function orthogonalization procedure , after which the actual proposed adaptive decorrelation algorithms are described .      when a nonlinearity order higher than the i m sub - band order is considered , multiple basis functions are adopted in the sub - band dpd processing , as described in section ii .",
    "taking as an example case the im3 + sub - band , the snl basis functions @xmath19 , @xmath73 , given in ( [ eq : im3_basisfunctions1])-([eq : im3_basisfunctions5 ] ) , are highly correlated .",
    "this can negatively impact the convergence and stability of the adaptive decorrelation - based learning .",

    "we then provide a thorough comparison of the computing and hardware complexity perspectives between the full - band and the proposed sub - band dpds . finally , some system power efficiency considerations are also presented , with particular focus on low - cost mobile devices .      fig .",
    "[ fig : implementationalternatives ] shows two alternative architectures of the overall sub - band dpd processing with multiple i m sub - bands . the first architecture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decorr_dpd_im5_im7_im9 ] adds an upsampling and digital if upconversion block after each sub - band dpd stage in order to digitally place the generated injection signals at proper intermediate frequencies . after adding the sub - band dpd outputs in the digital domain",
    ", a single wideband dac per i and q branch is used after which the signal is upconverted to rf and amplified by the pa .",
    "the second architecture in fig . [ fig : decorr_dpd_im5_im7_im9_2 ] adds the outputs of the sub - band dpds in the analog domain , implying that each sub - band dpd is followed by a narrow - band dac per i and q branch , together with an analog complex if upconversion .",
    "a common i / q rf modulator is then used for all sub - bands prior to the pa module .",
    "both of these two architectures have their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in particular , if the carrier spacing between the component carriers is not very large , architecture i is likely to be more suitable . on the other hand ,",
    "when the carrier spacing starts to increase , using a single wideband dac may not be efficient from cost and power consumption perspectives , so in this case architecture ii is likely to be more attractive .",
    "however , some extra processing may be required in this architecture in order to achieve proper synchronization between the dacs .",
    "this forms an interesting topic for future research .",
    "a common advantage of both architectures is that each sub - band dpd block can be switched on or off according to the prevailing emission levels and limits at the considered sub - bands .",
    "such flexibility is not available in the classical full - band dpd solutions since , by design , a full - band predistorter always tries to linearize the full composite transmit band . with the sub - band dpd concept ,",
    "the linearization can be flexibly tailored and optimized to those frequencies which are the most critical from the emission limits perspective .",
    "in general , the computational complexity of any dpd can be classified into three main parts @xcite : identification complexity , adaptation complexity and running complexity .",
    "the identification part is basically the estimation complexity of the dpd parameters , while the adaptation complexity includes the required processing in order to adapt to new operating conditions or device aging .",
    "finally , the running complexity , which is the most critical especially for mobile - type devices , involves the number of computations done per second while the dpd is operating . in this subsection",
    ", we will focus on the dpd running complexity in details , while the dpd parameter identification and feedback receiver complexity perspectives are shortly discussed in section [ sec : fb_complexity ] . for a quantitative comparison of the running complexities",
    ", we shall use the number of floating point operations ( flops ) per sample , the number of dpd coefficients , and the required sample rate in the predistortion path as the main quantitative metrics .    in general",
    ", the running complexity is divided into two main parts : the first is the basis function generation , and the second is the actual predistortion filtering using the basis functions @xcite . the number of flops required to perform these two operations is shown in table [ tab : flops ] for ninth - order sub - band and full - band dpds , respectively , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the corresponding memory depths per adopted basis function . the full - band dpd architecture that we use also in our comparative performance simulations in section",
    "v , and which is also widely applied otherwise , is based on the ph architecture with ninth order nonlinearity , while the sub - band dpd is based on architecture ii shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decorr_dpd_im5_im7_im9_2 ] . frequency selectivity of the nonlinear pa is another important factor to be considered when comparing the two dpd architectures .",
    "this implies that when memory effects of the pa are considered , substantially longer filters are needed for the full - band dpd compared to the sub - band dpd for a certain performance requirement . in the complexity analysis , in the sub - band dpd case",
    ", we thus assume a memory depth of @xmath120 per basis function , while a memory depth of @xmath121 is assumed for the full - band ph dpd per basis function .",
    "a substantial reduction in the needed sample rates can be achieved when adopting the sub - band dpd . as a concrete example , if we consider a challenging lte - a ul scenario of two 1 mhz ccs with 20 mhz carrier spacing , the required sample rate by the full - band dpd is @xmath122 , while for the sub - band dpd it becomes @xmath123 . .",
    "furthermore , the processing complexity of the sub - band dpd solution is clearly feasible for modern mobile device processing platforms , in terms of the gflops count , while that of the classical fullband dpd is clearly infeasible .",
    "however , in some scenarios , when the carrier spacing between the ccs is decreased and/or the cc bandwidth increases , the benefit from using the sub - band dpd approach is reduced since the sample rates of the sub - band and full - band dpd will become more comparable .",
    "notice also that , e.g. , in interband ca cases , one can adopt a concurrent 2d - dpd @xcite to linearize the main carriers , which can then be easily complemented with the sub - band dpd processing to protect the own receiver if tx filtering does not offer sufficient isolation .",
    "such a scenario could take place , e.g. , in uplink band 1 ( 1920 - 1980 mhz ) + band 3 ( 1710 - 1785 mhz ) interband ca where it is technologically feasible to adopt a single multiband / multimode pa module for amplification . in such scenario ,",
    "the im3 sub - band is then directly at the own rx frequencies of band 1 ( 2110 - 2170 mhz ) .",
    "in addition to the complexity reduction in the dpd main processing path , the complexity of the feedback or observation receiver , used for dpd parameter estimation and adaptation , is also greatly reduced . in order to estimate ,",
    "e.g. , the parameters of the im3 + sub - band dpd , we only need to observe the im3 + sub - band at the pa output , instead of observing the full - band ( including all the i m sub - bands ) which is the case in the full - band dpd .",
    "this reduces the cost , complexity and power consumption in the feedback path allowing use of simpler instrumentation , in particular the adc .",
    "moreover , only a single observation receiver is required , even if linearizing multiple sub - bands , since the parameter learning and corresponding observation of the pa output can be done sequentially , in a per sub - band manner . finally , in terms of the parameter estimation algorithmic complexity , the proposed decorrelation based solutions are extremely simple , when compared to any classical full - band dpd related method , such as least - squares based parameter fitting and indirect learning architecture @xcite that are commonly adopted .",
    "when a dpd is adopted , a less linear but more efficient pa , that can operate near its saturation region , can generally be used . however , the overall power efficiency of the device is only improved if the extra power consumed by the dpd stage is less than the power savings due to increased pa efficiency . here , we address this aspect from a mobile device perspective .    we consider a practical scenario where the transmit power at the output of the mobile pa is + 26 dbm ( i.e. , 400 mw ) , stemming from 3gpp lte - advanced requirements @xcite , and assuming that the tx duplexer filter and connector insertion losses are 3 db .",
    "then , good examples of practical pa power efficiency figures when operating in highly nonlinear or linear modes are around 35@xmath124 and 20@xmath124 ( or even less ) , respectively .",
    "this means that the power consumed by the highly nonlinear pa is roughly 1150 mwatt , while the corresponding linear pa consumes roughly 2000 mwatt . in other words , adopting a highly power - efficient nonlinear pa saves 850 mwatt of power in this particular example . then , in order to suppress the spurious emissions at the pa output , in the nonlinear pa case , we adopt the sub - band dpd solution .    in @xcite , a state of the art 28 nm implementation of the qualcomm hexagon dsp capable of supporting up to 4.8 gflops at 1.2 ghz is reported , which is more than enough for carrying out the needed sub - band dpd processing for the im3 and im5 sub - bands in our example . in the full - band dpd case , on the other hand , which requires 31.9 gflops as shown in table [ tab : flops ] , this is clearly insufficient .",
    "the power consumption of the dsp platform in @xcite is shown to be approximately 100 mwatt , when running at 840 mhz ( i.e. , 3.36 gflops assuming 4 flops per cycle ) , which is again sufficient for linearizing the im3 and im5 sub - bands in our example .",
    "thus , adopting the nonlinear pa already saves 850 milliwatt , when it comes to the pa interface , as explained above , while when complemented with the sub - band dpd processing for enhanced linearity , only 100 milliwatt of additional power is consumed .",
    "thus , the overall power budget and power - efficiency are clearly in favor of using a highly non - linear pa , complemented with the sub - band dpd structure , even in a mobile device with non - contiguous uplink carrier aggregation . furthermore",
    ", if the sub - band dpd processing is implemented using a dedicated hardware solution ( e.g. , a digital asic ) , an even more power - efficient dpd stage can most likely be realized .",
    "in this section , a quantitative performance analysis of the proposed sub - band dpd solution is presented using matlab simulations with practical models for mobile - like pas designed for low - cost devices . in general , we quantify the suppression of intermodulation power at the im3 and im5 sub - bands through the power ratios relative to the component carrier wanted signal power as shown in fig .",

    "the error signal is defined as the difference between the ideal symbol values and the corresponding synchronized and equalized samples at the pa output , both normalized to have identical linear gains .      in section [ sec : dpd_analytic_solutions ] , analytical reference expressions for the third - order inverse , minimum mse , and decorrelation - based sub - band dpd solutions were presented . in this subsection",

    "it can also be seen from table [ tab : im3r_evm_analytical ] that the evm is essentially not affected by the sub - band dpd processing .",

    "the proposed technique can find application in suppressing inband spurs which would violate the spurious emission limit , suppressing out - of - band spurs falling , e.g. , on the own receiver band , or in protecting primary user transmissions in cognitive radio systems .",
    "a quantitative complexity analysis was presented , comparing the proposed solution to conventional full - band dpd solutions available in the literature .",
    "the performance was evaluated in a comprehensive manner , showing excellent linearization performance despite the considerably reduced complexity compared to classical full - band solutions .",
    "finally , extensive rf measurement results using a commercial lte - advanced mobile power amplifier were reported , evidencing up to 22 db suppression of the most problematic third - order spurious emissions .",
    "here , we derive the analytical minimum mean - square error solution shown in ( 32 ) , which is used as a reference solution in simulations in section [ sec : analytical_sim ] .",
    "we first define the so - called error signal as @xmath59 , since with ideal predistortion the im3 + sub - band signal would be zero , and thus the optimization means minimizing the power of this error signal . from ( [ eq : thirdorderanalysis ] ) , the error signal reads @xmath135 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the third - order memoryless pa model parameters , @xmath53 denotes the dpd coefficient to be optimized , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the baseband equivalents of the two component carriers . the statistical expectation @xmath60={{\\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}[e(n)e^*(n)]$ ] , assuming that the component carrier signals @xmath6 and @xmath7 are statistically independent , and ignoring some high - order vanishingly small terms , then reads    @xmath136 = { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{42 } \\left[|f_3|^2 + |f_1|^2|\\alpha|^2 + \\alpha f_1 f_3^ * + \\alpha^ * f_1^ * f_3 \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   & + ( 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{62 } + 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{44 } ) \\left[|f_3|^2 ( \\alpha + \\alpha^ * ) + |\\alpha|^2(f_1 f_3^ * + f_1^ * f_3 ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 4 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{46 } + 8 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{64 } + 4 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{82 } ) |f_3|^2 |\\alpha|^2 ,   \\label{eq : meansquarederror}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is used as a shorthand notation for @xmath63 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}[|x_2|^j]$ ] .",
    "now , differentiating ( [ eq : meansquarederror ] ) with respect to @xmath53 , yields    @xmath137 & = { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{42}\\left[\\alpha^ * |f_1|^2 + f_1 f_3^ * \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{62 } + 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{44 } ) \\left[|f_3|^2 + \\alpha^ * ( f_1 f_3^ * + f_1^ * f_3 ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 4 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{46 } + 8 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{64 } + 4 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{82 } ) |f_3|^2 \\alpha^*. \\label{eq : meansquarederrordiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , setting ( [ eq : meansquarederrordiff ] ) to zero and solving for @xmath53 yields the optimal mmse dpd parameter , given by    @xmath61^*}{\\left[|f_1|^2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{42 } + 4 \\mathbb{r}(f_1 f_3^*)({{\\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{62 } + { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{44 } )   + 4 |f_3|^2 ( { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{46 } + 2 { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{64 } + { { \\rm i\\kern-.3em e}}_{82})\\right]^*},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 denotes the real - part operator .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "here , we derive the @xmath139 order inverse solution for the im3 + sub - band dpd , to be used as a reference solution in the simulations in section [ sec : inv_vs_decorr_sim ] .",
    "the output of a memoryless @xmath139 order polynomial pa model is    @xmath140 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath141 are the polynomial coefficients , and @xmath142 is the composite baseband equivalent input signal , as given in ( [ eq : pa_in ] ) . through direct substitution of ( [ eq : pa_in ] ) in ( [ eq : pa_5th_nomem ] ) , the baseband equivalent im3 + distortion term , located at three times the if frequency , can be extracted and reads    @xmath143 stemming from the signal structure in ( [ eq : im3_out_5th_nomem ] ) , the sub - band dpd injection signal is composed of three basis functions of the form @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in case of fifth - order inverse based sub - band dpd ,",
    "these basis functions are multiplied by proper coefficients such that all the distortion terms at the im3 + sub - band at the pa output , up to order five , are cancelled .",
    "thus , incorporating such dpd processing , yet with arbitrary coefficients , the composite baseband equivalent pa input signal reads    @xmath147 where the subscript @xmath148 in the coefficients is emphasizing the @xmath4-order inverse based solution . substituting ( [ eq : pa_in_fifthdpd ] ) in ( [ eq : pa_5th_nomem ] ) , and extracting the third and fifth order im3 + terms , yields                    r4 - 124353 ,  non - contiguous intraband unwanted emission .  , 3gpp tech .",
