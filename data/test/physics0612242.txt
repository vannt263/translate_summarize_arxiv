    "the problem of weakly bound states of three resonantly interacting particles , first discussed long ago by efimov @xcite , has attracted a particular interest in recent years @xcite owing to the development of refined experimental techniques allowing tunning of the inter - particle interaction .",
    "now , it has become possible to tune the two - body interaction in such a way that a two - body weakly bound or virtual state appears . in this situation ,",
    "three particles interacting pairwise through the two - body potential have a series of weakly bound states @xcite . if it happens that in addition to the weakly bound or virtual two - body state , there is another two - body bound state lying deeply below , the efimov states are able to dissociate into a dimer and a free atom . therefore ,",
    "in such a situation , the efimov states have finite lifetimes : these are efimov resonances @xcite .",
    "recently , such efimov resonances have been observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "efimov predicted an universal behavior for the energies of the efimov states @xcite : if one knows the position , let s say , of the lowest state , then the others can be found using a scaling law @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant depending on the actual interaction potential .",
    "this is possible because the long - range potential of an efimov - type system behaves as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hyper - radius and @xmath4 is the reduced three - body mass .",
    "the long - range behavior of the potential does not depend on details of the short - range two - body interaction .",
    "for the same reason , widths of the efimov resonances are scaled in the same way @xcite .",
    "thus , if one needs to find positions and widths of the efimov resonances for a particular three - body system , one has to be able to obtain at least one state : the approximate positions ( and widths ) of others can be obtained using the scaling law .",
    "wave functions for such weakly bound efimov states are characterized by a probability density located mainly at large inter - particle distances . on the other hand , in order to correctly obtain the accumulated phase , the small - distance part of the wave functions must also be represented accurately , even though the amplitude at such distances can be very small . due to the very different lengthscales in the two regions , the calculation of the wave functions ( of bound or resonant states ) becomes difficult .",
    "penkov @xcite previously presented a theory of efimov resonances using the formalism of faddeev equations .",
    "he calculated six resonances for a model two - body interaction potential : the obtained positions and widths are in agreement with the scaling law .",
    "later , nielsen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite computed efimov resonances for a different model potential , using an adiabatic hyperspherical method coupled with a multi - channel @xmath5-matrix method along the hyper - radius . in this approach",
    ", the authors obtained the scattering matrix as a function of energy above the lowest dissociation threshold .",
    "then , they deduced widths and positions of the resonances from the variation of the phase shift @xmath6 in the scattering matrix .    here , we are suggesting a different approach to calculate widths and positions of three - body resonances .",
    "this approach is general and can be used for weakly bound ( long - range ) and deeply - bound ( short - range ) resonances .",
    "the method uses hyperspherical coordinates similar to ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of solving a multi - channel scattering problem",
    ", we suggest employing the slow variable discretization ( svd ) @xcite method with adapted grid step @xcite in hyper - radius and hyperangles . as a basis set in hyper - radius",
    "we use the sine - dvr ( discrete variable representation ) method @xcite . at a large hyper - radius ,",
    "we place a complex absorbing potential ( cap ) to absorb the dissociating flux . positions and widths of the three - body resonances",
    "are obtained as real and imaginary parts of complex eigenvalues of the resulting hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section [ sec : hyper ] we present our approach of calculation of the three - body resonances .",
    "then , in section [ sec : barier ] , we apply the method to obtain a single resonance of three particles interacting through a potential with a barrier @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the resonance has a large amplitude mainly at relatively short distances .",
    "the second application of the developed method is discussed in section [ sec : efimov ] , where we calculate several efimov resonances for three particles interacting through a two - body short - range potential with a large two - body scattering length .",
    "we compare our results with a previous theoretical study @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] , we discuss advantages and possible applications of the method .",
    "in our approach we assume that the total angular momentum of the three - body system is zero .",
    "thus , only three interparticle coordinates determine the configuration of the system .",
    "we represent the three interparticle coordinates by the smith - whitten hyperspherical coordinates @xcite .",
    "the formulas of the actual version of the coordinates can be found in refs .",
