    "in mesoscopic systems , the measurement of current and noise makes it possible to probe the effective charges which flow in conductors , and opens the possibility for studying the role of the statistics in stationary quantum transport experiments .",
    "this has been illustrated experimentally and theoretically in both cases where the interaction between electrons is less important@xcite or when it is more relevant@xcite .",
    "the present work deals with the study of photo - assisted shot noise in a specific one dimensional correlated system : a hall bar in the fractional hall regime , for which charge transport occurs via two counter - propagating chiral edges states .    over the years , the attention has been focusing also on the transport properties of systems on which an external harmonic perturbation is acting .",
    "a fundamental step is first to study the current response .",
    "for instance , it is possible to generate a dc current by applying voltage gates on which an ac perturbation is acting @xcite . here",
    "we consider the superposition of a dc bias with a time dependent perturbation . for normal and superconducting systems ,",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the photo - assisted shot noise allows to retrieve information on the finite frequency noise , which was computed for ballistic systems@xcite , and measured in diffusive metallic wires @xcite .",
    "such finite frequency measurements turn out to be challenging in practice . on the other hand ,",
    "if an experiment is devoted to zero frequency noise , information on the finite frequency noise spectrum can be retrieved provided that the system has an added , external , finite frequency perturbation . in particular , the presence of a small , additional harmonic perturbation modifies the phase of the charge carriers ( reflection / transmission probabilities are affected to a lesser extent ) , and in some sense it acts as a probe to study the finite frequency noise spectrum of the conductor .",
    "note that the external modulation can either be imposed on a gate voltage , located in the vicinity of the conductor , which controls the transparency of the barrier .",
    "this corresponds to the gedanken experiment for the traversal time in tunneling@xcite and to the early proposals for photo - assisted shot noise@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the transport properties of an irradiated point contact@xcite have also been studied with this point of view .",
    "alternatively , the modulation can be imposed from the leads to which the system is connected , which may be simpler to achieve in experiments , because no additional gating is required . for non - interacting electrons , it has been shown@xcite that the derivative of the current noise with respect to the bias exhibits evenly spaced steps whose height is specified by bessel functions .",
    "this result  which was derived using scattering theory  has been generalized to diffusive metallic wires using known random matrix theory results and has been tested experimentally for normal diffusive metals@xcite and recently for ballistic samples in a point contact geometry@xcite .",
    "one then enquires whether electronic correlations will play an important role on the photo - assisted shot noise characteristics . in multichannel conductors described by a scattering theory , transport properties ( current and noise )",
    "have been analyzed while taking into account screening in a self - consistent treatment@xcite . for a normal metal ",
    "superconducting junction biased in the andreev regime , the correlations in the superconductor are responsible for a doubling of the electron charge in the shot noise @xcite .",
    "the noise derivative with respect to bias voltage then exhibits steps whose spacing contains the charge of a cooper pair , as confirmed by recent experiments@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can argue that ns systems are not so far from free electron systems , as these can be modeled by a scattering theory in which electrons are converted in hole and vice versa@xcite .",
    "another possible ground for studying the effect of interactions is to consider a one  dimensional correlated electron system  a luttinger liquid .",
    "reduced dimensionality is known to affect drastically the current - voltage characteristics @xcite .",
    "the finite frequency current response of a one dimensional wire has been discussed in ref . , while the effect of a localized time dependent perturbation on the conductance of a non - chiral luttinger liquid was addressed recently in ref . .",
    "the noise spectrum of a hall bar in the fractional hall regime was presented in ref . .",
    "here we choose the same model as the latter , mainly a simple fractional quantum hall fluid consisting of two edge states with a point contact .",
    "the potential difference between the two edges has both a dc and an ac component .",
    "the time average current flowing in this system has been discussed using a semi - classical approach in ref . . here",
    ", we concentrate on the shot noise in both the weak and strong backscattering regimes .",
    "it is expected that the step like behavior of non interacting electrons will be strongly modified when the electron filling factor @xmath2 deviates from @xmath3 .",
    "it is also expected that in the weak backscattering regime , the fractional charge @xmath4 probed by dc shot noise experiments@xcite should appear explicitly : the spacing between singularities in the shot noise should be given by the josephson frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dc bias voltage .",

    "the meaning of the poissonian limit is that quasiparticles which tunnel from one edge to another do so in an independent manner .",

    "( [ noise_definition ] ) is our definition of the real time correlator , but this choice is not necessarily obvious .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out in ref .   that the choice of correlator  symmetrized or non symmetrized  depends on how the noise measurement is performed .",
    "more recently , ref . has argued that the non ",
    "symmetrized correlator corresponds to what is actually probed at finite frequencies , provided that the detector which is used to measure the noise is set at sufficiently low temperatures . in the dc regime",
    "however , it is well understood that such differences do not matter , as long as one considers zero frequency noise . in the present work ,",
    "the origin for off - equilibrium phenomena comes from both a dc bias and an ac drive .",
    "the latter effect breaks time translational invariance , so that the finite frequency noise involves in general two frequencies@xcite : @xmath80 here , one of the main purpose of this work is to analyze the noise when both frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath82 are set to zero , because the presence of the ac perturbation mimics at finite frequency noise measurement . for zero frequencies ,",

    "the zero frequency fourier transform of the current does not display any structure at the step locations for the noise : it is simply linear .",
    "7 cm    for lower values of the filling factor , electronic correlations modify this behavior drastically . generally speaking , the power law behavior @xmath91 should have a `` stronger '' singularity for lower filling factors . for the fractional quantum hall effect ,",

    "the results are illustrated with filling factor @xmath92 , which represents the correlated state which is `` easiest '' to access experimentally@xcite .",
    "7 cm    first , one observes that contrary to the free electron case , the zero frequency fourier transform of the current displays singularities every time @xmath76 reaches an integer value ( fig .",

    "such singularities reflect the tunneling density of states of the quasiparticles , in a similar manner which is observed in the backscattering current ",

    "nevertheless , one should remember that the present calculation is only valid in the weak backscattering regime : the current @xmath93 whose fourier transform is displayed in fig .",

    "next , the noise ( for both frequencies set to zero ) is plotted as a function of bias . while at @xmath55 , the noise was found to be a continuous function of @xmath66 ( with discontinuous derivatives ) , for @xmath92 it displays evenly spaced singularities as for the current ( fig .",

    "the interesting feature in the present work is that when one considers the ac driven noise , with both frequencies set to zero , one recovers information on a dc , finite frequency measurement .",

    ", we see that the photo - assisted shot noise is a smooth function of @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that the strong backscattering regime does not offer any straightforward diagnosis for effective charges as in the weak backscattering case .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness , we mention that for fractional quantum hall systems in the strong backscattering regime , super - poissonian noise has been observed in dc shot noise measurements .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that @xcite at sufficiently low temperatures , the effective charge which tunnels from one quantum hall fluid to the other , as analyzed by the ratio @xmath102 , can be equal to @xmath103 or can be even larger .",
    "these experiments suggest that the relevant tunneling process involves pairs  or groups  of electrons . from the point of view of our model , this means that one should take into account the tunneling of such pairs , while an inspection of the renormalization group equations tells us that such processes should be less relevant than the bare electron tunneling term . while this topic is still under debate , and has no simple theoretical explanation for the dc shot noise , here can only give a schematic picture of what will happen for the photo - assisted shot noise . in the above",
    ", one recalls that the vanishing of the density of states for single electron tunneling in a luttinger liquid is the reason why photo - assisted shot noise does not display any sharp features for the strong backscattering regime .",
    "the density of states for two electron tunneling is expected to vanish with an exponent @xmath104 , i.e. much faster than the single electron case .",
    "we thus expect no sharp features to show up in the photo  assisted shot noise at integer values of @xmath76 .",
    "in order to gain further insights for the backscattering current away from the tunneling regime , we study the limit @xmath1 where it is possible to refermionize .",
    "the various chiral current correlators which appear in the calculation of the dc backscattering noise and in the dc shot noise have been computed in this manner in ref . .",

    "the noise and backscattering current for a weak impurity contain singularities at integer values of the fraction @xmath76 . at finite temperatures however , these singularities will be smeared out and the peak heights should scale as @xmath130 as in ref . , while they will also acquire thermal broadening .",

    "a similar structure does not show up in the strong backscattering regime because , in this case , electron tunneling density of states are involved , rather than quasiparticle tunneling density of states .",

    "the photo - assisted current was derived to first order in this amplitude in the present work , but generalizations of this method , concerning the study of the rectification property of the current ( its zero frequency fourier transform ) or the photo  assisted shot noise are possible in principle , but they remain a challenge because of the need to pursue the calculation to higher orders in the drive amplitude .    note that the present work treats both edges as independent entities , which are only coupled via the tunneling hamiltonian of eq .",

    "a more precise model would include density - density interactions between both edges in the vicinity of the impurity , for instance described by a screened coulomb interaction .",
    "such interactions were considered for electron wave guides containing two coupled non - chiral luttinger liquids in section 7 of ref . , and",
    "the transport properties of this system through an impurity were analyzed in ref . , assuming that the interaction is effective over the whole length of the wire .",
    "here however , one focuses on a situation where the edge excitations have a chiral character . for the integer quantum hall effect",
    ", the screened interaction between two electron edge states were discussed previously@xcite .",
    "this interaction alone  over a finite length which characterizes the regions where the two edges are in close proximity  is understood to lead to backscattering of the collective excitations .",
    "indeed , the interaction between edges will give rise to a local inhomogeneity of the luttinger liquid interaction parameter , as seen in ref .  .",
    "although a full generalization to the fractional quantum hall situation is not fully available , it plausible that the same applies to the present situation . in the presence of such screened interaction , in the vicinity of the impurity , the `` proper '' excitations would mix right and left moving excitations , so that the tunneling hamiltonian and current operator would have to be rewritten in terms of new excitations which diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "one then expects for backscattering to be enhanced by the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "nevertheless , such inter - edge interaction will have a lesser role if the tunneling between the two edge states is weak , which is a working assumption of the present work .",
    "in fact , such considerations should first be addressed for a dc shot noise measurement in the fqhe alone , rather than in the present work , whose goal is to focus mainly on photo - assisted transport .",
