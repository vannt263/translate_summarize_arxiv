    "nuclear thermodynamics has attracted considerable attention in recent years .",
    "several temperature - dependent nuclear properties such as nuclear shapes , giant dipole resonance widths and their fluctuation properties have been investigated in the literature @xcite . in this context one of the most interesting topics",
    "is that of phase transitions in atomic nuclei .",
    "different types of phase transitions have been discussed in nuclear physics .",
    "one is the first order phase transition in the multifragmentation of nuclei which occurs at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "negative heat capacities observed in multifragmentation of nuclei have been obtained from energy fluctuations and interpreted as an indicator of a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the second type of phase transition in atomic nuclei is the transition from a phase with strong pairing correlations to a phase with weak pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "the onset of a discontinuity in thermodynamic variables and the evolution of zeros of the canonical @xcite and grand - canonical partition functions @xcite in the complex plane have been discussed in terms of pairing transitions .",
    "recently @xcite , thermal properties for @xmath5fe have been calculated using both static - path approximation ( spa ) and spa plus random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "these calculations show that the increase of the moment of inertia with increasing temperature is correlated with the suppression of pairing correlations .",
    "furthermore , structures in the heat - capacity curve related to the quenching of pairing correlations have been obtained within relativistic mean field theory @xcite , the finite - temperature hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory @xcite , and the shell - model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach @xcite .",
    "an @xmath7-shaped structure in the heat capacity curve derived from the level densities of low - spin states has also been observed experimentally @xcite and interpreted as a signature of a pairing phase transition .    as a part of an ongoing effort , in the present work",
    "we extract several thermodynamic properties of @xmath5fe and @xmath6fe isotopes starting from nuclear level densities .",
    "details of the experiment , analysis tools , the oslo method , and experimental level densities are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] .",
    "thermodynamic concepts are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : thermo ] and comparison with a combinatorial model is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : calc ] . finally our results are summarized in sect .",

    "the self - supporting @xmath6fe target was bombarded by a 2-na beam of 45-mev @xmath2he particles from the oslo cyclotron laboratory at the university of oslo .",
    "the target was isotopically enriched to 94.7% , and had a thickness of 3.4 mg/@xmath8 .",
    "the outgoing charged particles were recorded by eight si @xmath9e - e telescopes , which were collimated and placed 5 cm away from the target at a ring located at 45@xmath10 with respect to the beam direction . the particle telescopes covered 0.3% of the total solid angle .",
    "the thicknesses of the front and the end detectors were 140 and 3000 @xmath11 m , respectively , and the particle energy resolution was @xmath12 0.3 mev over the entire spectrum .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 rays were detected by 28 collimated 5@xmath13 x 5@xmath13 nai(tl ) detectors with a total efficiency of @xmath12 15% of 4@xmath14 , and with 6% energy resolution at 1.3 mev . in order to monitor the selectivity and populated spin distribution of the reactions , one 60% ge(hp ) detector was used .",
    "the excitation energy of the final nucleus is determined from the known @xmath15 value and the reaction kinematics using particle-@xmath1 coincidence information .",
    "a total @xmath1-ray spectrum is obtained for each excitation energy region .",
    "these @xmath1-ray spectra are then unfolded using a compton subtraction method @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional primary @xmath1-ray matrix is extracted by applying a subtraction method to the unfolded @xmath1-ray spectra @xcite .",
    "basic assumptions and details of the subtraction method are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the primary @xmath1-ray matrix is factorized using the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite , according to which the probability of emitting a @xmath1 ray from an excited state is proportional to the @xmath1-ray transmission coefficient @xmath16 and the level density at the final energy @xmath17 .",
    "this factorization is determined by a least @xmath18 method without assuming any functional form for the level density and the @xmath1-ray transmission coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , this method does not provide a unique solution .",
    "this factorization is invariant under the transformation @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the free parameters of the transformation .",
    "therefore it is very important to determine accurately the free parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 in order to find the physical solution .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath22 are determined from the normalization of the level density to the discrete levels at low excitation energies and to the density of the neutron resonances at the neutron binding energy @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is then determined using the average total radiative width of neutron resonances @xcite .",
    "since there are no neutron resonance data for the @xmath5fe compound nucleus a different procedure for the normalization of the level density is performed .",
    "we use @xmath6fe as a basis , since both average neutron resonance spacings @xmath24 and total radiative widths @xmath25 of neutron resonances are well known @xcite . the procedure for extracting the total level density @xmath26 from the average resonance spacing @xmath24",
    "is described in ref .",
    "then we apply the von egidy and bucurescu parameterization of the back - shifted fermi gas formula @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the level density parameter , and the intrisic excitation energy @xmath29 is determined by the backshift parameter @xmath30 . in this global description of the level density ,",
    "shell corrections are taken into account in the estimation of the @xmath28 and @xmath30 parameters @xcite . by fitting @xmath31",
    "to @xmath26 in @xmath6fe , we determine the normalization parameter @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsfg ] ) .",
    "this value is then adopted for @xmath5fe together with the prescribed @xmath28 and @xmath30 parameters .",
    "the parameters used are listed in table [ ld_par ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rho56_57 ] shows the level densities of @xmath0fe from the ground state up to @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 mev .",
    "they are normalized to discrete levels at low excitation energies ( jagged lines ) and to the level densities at the neutron binding energy @xmath23 ( triangles ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the fitting regions used .",
    "as described above , the triangles are determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsfg ] ) with @xmath36 for @xmath5fe and from the observed @xmath24 value for @xmath6fe .",
    "the level density obtained with the oslo method follows well that obtained by counting of discrete levels up to around 5 and 2.5 mev of excitation energies in @xmath0fe , respectively .",
    "both nuclei show an abrupt increase in level density at @xmath37 mev , indicating the first breaking of nucleon cooper pairs .",
    "figure [ fig : rho56_57 ] also includes level densities from particle evaporation data ( open circles ) measured with the @xmath38mn(d , n)@xmath5fe reaction @xcite , and with the @xmath39fe(@xmath40he,@xmath22)@xmath6fe and @xmath41co(@xmath42)@xmath6fe reactions @xcite . the method determines the slope of the level densities , but not the absolute normalization constant .",
    "thus , these data have been scaled to match @xmath31 ( solid smooth curves ) .",
    "the slopes of the level densities from evaporation studies fit very well with the employed @xmath31 .",
    "this gives support to the level density parameters @xmath28 extracted as prescribed in ref .",
    "@xcite and listed in table  [ ld_par ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) we see that the @xmath22 parameter determines the slope of the transmission coefficient , and thereby also the radiative strength function ( rsf ) @xmath43 , assuming only dipole radiation .",
    "the rsfs have been published previously @xcite , but with other normalization procedures .",
    "thus , for completeness , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsf56_57 ] the renormalized rsfs . in the @xmath6fe case , the @xmath21 parameter of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) was determined from the average radiative width @xmath44 of neutron resonances at @xmath23  @xcite . for @xmath5fe , where no @xmath44 exists ,",
    "we scale the total rsf to match @xmath6fe .",
    "the parameters are listed in table  [ ld_par ] .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + [ tab : tab2 ] @xmath45 taken from @xmath39fe .",
    "the experimental and calculated level densities for @xmath0fe are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : micro ] . in general",
    ", there is a very good overall agreement between the measured level densities and the calculations , even without reducing the pairing gap .",
    "this is in contradiction with what is usually thought using the canonical ensemble .",
    "however , excitation energy around 8 mev may be too low to see the overall quenching of the pairing correlations demonstrated in figs .",
    "( [ fig : sfec ] ) and ( [ fig : mu ] ) .",
    "microcanonical and canonical ensembles yield different results for small systems .",
    "it is , therefore , no surprise that one measures different thermodynamic quantities within these ensembles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : micro ] , especially for @xmath5fe , it is gratifying how both the general functional form and the absolute magnitude of the level densities are reproduced . in the case of @xmath6fe",
    ", there is an overshoot in the calculated level density compared to the experimental data from about 3.5 mev excitation energy .",
    "this excess could be due to the neutron @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 orbitals coming into play too soon , that is , they are too close to the neutron fermi level .",
    "another possibility is that the adopted ( constant ) deformation is too large at these excitation energies , where it may be that the nuclear structure favors a more spherical shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : pairs ] shows the average number of broken cooper pairs @xmath49 as a function of excitation energy .",
    "both neutron and proton pairs are taken into account , adding up to the total number of broken pairs . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pairs ] , the pair - breaking process is seen to start at @xmath50 mev for both nuclei , in accordance with the values used for the pair - gap parameters ( see table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) .",
    "a prominent step structure at @xmath51 is seen clearly in @xmath5fe for excitation energies between @xmath52 mev , and for @xmath6fe in the energy region @xmath53 mev .",
    "this means that on average there is one cooper pair broken , which could be either a proton or a neutron pair . for @xmath5fe ,",
    "the total @xmath49 exhibits an increase for @xmath54 mev up to about 9 mev , where there seems to be a saturation for @xmath55 .",
    "this is also reflected in the proton and neutron contributions to @xmath49 .",
    "a similar behavior can be seen in @xmath6fe for excitation energies higher than @xmath56 mev .",
    "we observe that the onset of this increase is at higher excitation energies than for @xmath5fe .",
    "a possible explanation of this is that the @xmath6fe valence neutron blocks the quasi - particles created during the pair - breaking process , suppressing the average number of quasi - particles even at high excitation energies .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the neutron contribution to the total @xmath49 is lower or about the same as the proton contribution in @xmath6fe , while in @xmath5fe , the neutron contribution is in general higher than the proton contribution .",
    "the present model gives the opportunity of investigating the parity distribution as a function of excitation energy .",
    "for this purpose , we utilize the parity asymmetry defined in ref .",
    "@xcite by @xmath57 which becomes @xmath58 if only negative parity states are present , @xmath59 if there are only positive parity states , and 0 when both parities are equally represented . in literature",
    ", one also find the expression @xmath60 which relates to @xmath22 by    @xmath61    the parity asymmetry @xmath22 for @xmath0fe is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] , we see that there is an excess of positive parity states in @xmath5fe and negative parity states in @xmath6fe . as the excitation",
    "energy increases , the parity asymmetry decreases for both nuclei , and shows an almost decay - like behavior , especially in the case of @xmath6fe . here , the parity asymmetry is close to zero at @xmath62 mev . for @xmath5fe , there is still a significant overshoot of positive - parity states in this energy region , giving an average parity asymmetry of @xmath63 for @xmath64 mev .",
    "we have compared our results with the shell - model monte carlo results of y.  alhassid _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and with recent macroscopic - microscopic calculations performed by d.  mocelj _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio @xmath60 is shown for @xmath5fe , indicating a value of @xmath65 at 10 mev excitation energy . from fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio @xmath66 for @xmath67 mev . using an average parity asymmetry of @xmath63",
    "as determined in the previous section , we obtain @xmath68 , which implies a considerable number of additional positive - parity states than predicted by the macroscopic - microscopic model and the shell - model monte carlo approach . for @xmath6fe with @xmath69 for @xmath64 mev , we find @xmath70 .",
    "however , one should note that in our calculations , the parity asymmetry strongly depends on the position of the neutron @xmath48 orbital relative to the fermi level ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nilsson ] ) .",
    "nuclear level densities for @xmath0fe are renormalized using the new level density parameterization suggested by von egidy and bucurescu .",
    "the level densities obtained with the oslo method agree well with those obtained from other experiments .",
    "the experimental level densities are used to extract thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the entropies for @xmath0fe obtained in the microcanonical ensemble reveal step structures indicating the breaking of nucleon cooper pairs .",
    "the entropy carried by the single neutron at higher excitation energies ( 4  mev @xmath71 7  mev ) is estimated to be @xmath72 which is smaller than that of the rare - earth isotopes .    assuming a constant @xmath73 , a critical temperature for the depairing process was determined . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "several thermodynamic properties were investigated .",
    "probability density functions for @xmath0fe were also extracted which reveal the difference between small systems such as the atomic nucleus and a system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "microscopic model calculations based on bcs quasiparticles were performed .",
    "the overall agreement between the experimental and calculated level densities are good .",
    "step structures observed in the experimental level densities are also observed in the plot of the average number of broken pairs as a function of excitation energy .",
    "the parity distributions obtained from model calculations for @xmath0fe indicate a decrease of parity asymmetry for both isotopes as the excitation energy increases .",
    "the microscopic model , which is expressed within the microcanonical ensemble ( fixed @xmath33 with no heat bath ) , describes the observed level densities without the need of attenuation of the pairing - gap energies for excitation energies below 8 mev .",
