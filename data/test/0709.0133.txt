    "lead sulfide ( pbs ) , the mineral galena , is an important material in lead smelting@xcite",
    ". it can be found in nature and also grown as an n- or p - type semiconductor with carrier concentrations as low as @xmath1 .",
    "its small electronic gap ( 0.4ev ) , with an anomalous temperature dependence@xcite , implies small effective masses which make pbs useful as a material for nanostructures@xcite . on the negative side , it is a visually offensive black product which appears during the degradation of lead white pigment in artwork@xcite .",
    "it has been used as a nanoparticle source in very ancient metallic lustre pottery , possibly the oldest known form of controlled nanotechnology@xcite .",
    "it has also found an age old application in the adulteration of an eye - lining cosmetic called `` kohl '' ( sb@xmath2s@xmath3)@xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy provides a versatile , non - destructive technique for the investigation and characterization of semiconducting materials@xcite .",
    "the nacl structure of pbs , however , makes the material first order raman forbidden .",
    "nevertheless , it has been recently discovered that characteristic raman spectra are obtained when lasers in the red are used as raman spectroscopic sources .",
    "these spectra are dominated by a band ( actually a doublet ) centered at around @xmath0 and a somewhat narrower peak at @xmath4 .",
    "a few other characteristic weak structures are also observed .",
    "these spectra have been recently used for the characterization of lustre pottery and possibly adulterated `` kohl''5,6 .    in a recent publication@xcite ,",
    "our group investigated the dependence of the two aforementioned raman bands on the isotopic mass of sulfur and on temperature , the latter being limited to the 100 - 300k region .",
    "the lack of data at lower temperatures hampers the investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the observed anharmonic temperature shifts .",
    "therefore , in the present work we undertook the investigation of these raman spectra down to a temperature of @xmath5 .",
    "as in the case of the anomalous temperature dependence of the electronic gap ( but most likely unrelated to it ) the frequency of the @xmath0 band anomalously increases with increasing temperatures , a fact that suggests interaction of each of the two phonons responsible for this @xmath6 band with a set of two phonons at lower frequencies ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath8 band on the isotopic mass of sulfur , however , is normal and suggests that the corresponding eigenvectors are sulfur dominated ( for a general discussion of the dependence of anharmonic self - energies on isotopic masses see ref .",
    "9 ) . in order to complete the assignment of the observed raman structures",
    ", we have calculated the phonon dispersion relations of pbs based on an _ ab initio _ lda electronic band structure@xcite .",
    "using these dispersion relations , which are rather close to the few points measured with inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , we have calculated the density of two phonon states for both sums and differences of two phonons , which is relevant to the interpretation of the two - phonon raman scattering .",
    "a thorough discussion of the observed spectra based on the calculated two phonon density of states is given .",
    "the samples were similar ( in some cases identical ) to those used in ref . .",
    "the synthetic samples were grown as discussed in refs . .",
    "the natural pbs samples whose spectra we report were mineral galena ( cleaved surfaces ) from creede , colorado .",
    "they were p - type with hole concentrations @xmath9 .",
    "the isotopically modified samples were also p - type , with @xmath10 they were mounted in a closed - cycle he - cryostat ( cti - cryogenics , mansfield , ma usa ) with temperature control in the range @xmath11 and optical quartz windows .",
    "raman measurements were performed using the @xmath12 line of a kr@xmath13-ion laser which was focused to a @xmath14 diameter spot with @xmath15 incident power measured at the entrance window of the cryostat .",
    "the signal was collected using a photographic zoom lens ( canon , @xmath1610 magnification ) of high numerical aperture ( 0.45 ) onto the entrance slit of a high - dispersion double - additive u1000 jobin - yvon spectrometer coupled to a liquid n@xmath17-cooled ccd detector ( 512 pixels ) without any polarization analysis .",
    "integration times in the range @xmath18 ( repeated 3 times , for the software to identify and discard spurious cosmic rays in the spectra ) were used for different measurements in each window of the spectral range .",
    "the high dispersion of the double u1000 spectrometer in the red region ( @xmath19 implies that several ccd - windows ( eight ) are needed to cover the full spectral range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "data acquisition of the intrinsically weak second - order spectra is therefore slow and ultimately limited by the long - term stability of the optical system plus cryostat .",
    "the chosen integration times were a compromise between signal - to - noise ratio and a total integration time that would allow a full temperature scan within a period of several hours .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows our raw second - order raman data for natural pbs at different temperatures .",
    "these spectra are dominated by two main features in the @xmath22 and @xmath0 regions .",
    "there is evidence in the experimental spectra for substructure in these peaks , to wit : @xmath23 the singularity at @xmath0 is clearly a doublet and can be represented as such throughout the entire temperature range by means of two gaussians . @xmath24",
    "the singularity at @xmath4 only reveals itself as a broad doublet at temperatures below @xmath25 , as we shall show in what follows . above @xmath25",
    "it is very difficult to isolate its two individual components , most likely because of increasing anharmonic broadening@xcite .    as already mentioned , the @xmath26 kr@xmath13-laser line was one of the few lines with which data could be obtained in both natural and isotopically substituted pbs .",
    "going farther into the visible ( in the green , for example , at 514 nm , see fig . 2 of ref .",
    ") resulted in undesirable ( extrinsic ) backgrounds that almost completely obliterated the ( already very weak ) second - order spectra ( see also fig . 8 of ref . ) . on the other hand , going into the near - ir region ( e.g. the @xmath27  nm line of a kr@xmath28-ion laser ) results in very weak intrinsic second - order spectra .",
    "laser excitation around @xmath12 seemed to be a good compromise between low background and reasonable signal - to - noise level ( possibly aided by a weak resonance effect in the red @xcite ) .",
    "another important experimental detail is the power level of the laser .",
    "the surface of pbs tends to be rather sensitive to photodecomposition ( mainly , but not exclusively , in the presence of oxygen ) .",
    "the power densities used in these measurements are well below any measurable photo - degradation of the surface throughout the total integration time .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the observation of two main structures in the raman spectra : @xmath23 one structure at high wavenumbers , around @xmath29 which is a doublet and has already been related to the generation of two optical ( actually @xmath30 ) phonons @xcite and , @xmath24 a second structure at @xmath31 which is possibly also a doublet but can not be well resolved in most of the measured spectra and must be related to either two acoustic phonons ( @xmath32 ) or two optic ones ( @xmath33 ) as will be discussed later .",
    "our experimental approach is to characterize the behavior of these spectral features as a function of temperature and to ascertain how they differ between natural and isotopically substituted samples . beside these main features ,",
    "some weak and broad structures have been surmised at @xmath34 , 340 , and 500@xmath35 .",
    "these structures probably correspond to those in fig .",
    "4 of ref . at 174 , and 320@xmath35 . in this figure",
    ", a rather sharp peak appears at 135@xmath35 which is below the frequency range of our spectra and we can not definitely assign to pbs . the peaks observed in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "at 600 and 961@xmath35 do not seem to correspond to the second - order spectrum of pbs .",
    "they are probably due to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 vibrations of so@xmath38 tetrahedra in some form of lead sulfate@xcite .",
    "resolving the different peaks which contribute to the main two singularities under discussion is the first step to understand their temperature dependent behavior and , accordingly , their dependence on isotopic mass .",
    "the basic limitation here is the lack of a reliable anaytical model for the singularities in the phonon densities of states ( see next section ) responsible for the second - order scattering observed .",
    "gaussian lineshapes represent the individual singularities rather well , and will be used throughout our analysis .",
    "the fact that gaussian lineshapes work well may also indicate that the shape of the observed structures is heavily influenced by anharmonicity , rather than by the specific type of dos critical points involved .",
    "an additional problem is the reliability of the fits at high temperatures , where even the high energy doublet around @xmath39 merges into a visually unresolved single peak , and the signal - to - noise ratio worsens considerably .",
    "fits can still be obtained by restricting the range in which the different parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "resolution of the two components , however , is not a problem at temperatures below @xmath40 : at these temperatures the @xmath41 peaks are resolved even to the naked eye .",
    "we tried two ways of isolating the different contributions to the singularities as depicted in fig .",
    "one is a direct fit with two gaussians , an example of which is shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) for the high - wavenumbers feature .",
    "an alternative way that works satisfactorily throughout the entire temperature range is also to estimate the energy of the peaks by numerically calculating the second derivatives of the observed spectra ( a common practice when dealing with electronic dielectric functions and the related energy gaps ) ; such derivative spectra are shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) . in this latter case",
    "the analysis becomes independent of the specific lineshape model used to fit the data : the critical energies can be assigned to the wavenumber of the deepest spectral features in the derivative spectra ( see arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "the best comparison between natural pbs and isotopically substituted pb@xmath42s is obtained from the direct observation of the spectra at the lowest achievable temperature in our experimental setup ( i.e. @xmath43 , as shown in fig .",
    "the maximum of the low - wavenumbers feature shifts from @xmath44 in natural pbs to @xmath45 in pb@xmath42s at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 shift ) .",
    "however , the corresponding lineshapes are not exactly the same and therefore the shift so obtained is not expected to be very precise .",
    "the maximum of the high - wavenumbers feature , on the other hand , moves by @xmath48 , from @xmath49 down to @xmath50 between the two samples . despite differences in the lineshapes between one case and the other",
    ", the feature at high wavenumbers seems to be more susceptible to a mass change in s than that at low wavenumbers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the low - wavenumbers feature is difficult to follow for a variety of reasons which include the fact that a doublet can not be discerned above @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , this feature does not seem to be very sensitive to the sulfur mass substitution . for a discussion of the dependence of the observed shift with temperature we therefore concentrate on the high - wavenumber feature at @xmath52 .",
    "this feature shifts up in frequency with increasing temperatures ( an unusual sign of the shift@xcite ) note that the 210 @xmath35 peak , and that at 150 @xmath35 , both show the usual down - shift with increasing temperatures@xcite .",
    "data in the isotopically enriched sample have been taken over a smaller energy range comprising only 3 ccd windows with longer integration times ( @xmath53 ) , in order to obtain the frequency of the peaks with better accuracy .",
    "the measurement thus requires @xmath54 of integration time for each temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the high - wavenumber feature in pb@xmath42s can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    of the two components of this doublet ,",
    "the one with the highest intensity is the easiest and most reliable to follow as a function of temperature .",
    "the second peak , at higher frequencies , becomes very weak above @xmath55 and its energy can not be very accurately determined .",
    "we thus concentrate on the temperature dependence of the former which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for both the natural and the isotopically modified samples .",
    "the data shown in fig . 5 for both samples exhibit the characteristic temperature dependence expected from anharmonic interactions ( the phonon under consideration decaying into two virtual ones ) .",
    "we have used for the fits described below both the data displayed here and those reported in ref .",
    "corresponding to higher temperatures ( which overlap only in the @xmath56 temperature range with our data)@xcite .",

    "[ eq1 ] for both natural pbs and pb@xmath70s .",
    "the fit parameters are summarized in table [ table ] .",
    "these parameters have , actually , large error bars because the wavenumbers of the peaks change by @xmath71 over the full temperature range and are hard to pin down to better than @xmath72 , as can be easily surmised by visual inspection of the raw data . based in the information discussed below ( _ vide infra _ ) regarding the dispersion relations and the phonon density of states , the following picture of the anharmonic interaction responsible for the temperature shift of the @xmath0mode emerges .",
    "the shift is affected by virtual decay into two modes ( 65 @xmath73 with basically pb and very little s character .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to fix @xmath60 to be the same for both samples , as was done when performing the fit .",
    "this decreases the number of parameters of the combined fits by one and produces more physically meaningful values for the other parameters .",

    "the interpretation of the phenomenology just described is helped by calculations of the phonon dispersion relations of pbs and the relevant densities of one and two - phonon states ( the latter with @xmath78-vectors equal in magnitude but opposite in sign ) .",
    "semiempirical calculations are available in the literature@xcite ; they were performed by fitting a few parameters to a number of experimental frequencies obtained vs. * k * by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , as reported in ref . .",

    "the `` sum '' processes are responsible for the anharmonic down - conversion into two phonons of lower energy@xcite ; while the `` difference '' anharmonic decay describes the process by which a phonon is destroyed simultaneously with a second low frequency phonon ( which must be already in the crystal ) and a phonon of higher energy ( with respect to the initial one ) is created .",
    "the difference processes tend to have less importance at low temperatures and vanish for @xmath64 .",
    "sum and difference processes are not only responsible for anharmonic phonon decay but should also determine the second - order raman spectra discussed here .",

    "the discrepancies which exist between experimental and calculated points are not surprising when one considers that no adjustable parameters have been used in the latter .",

    "they may be due to anharmonic shifts which affect the experimental data but are not included in the purely harmonic calculations .",
    "they are in part included in the semiempirical calculation because of the use of adjustable parameters .",

    "[ fig6 ] .  the results in figs .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig8 ] set the framework for the following discussion .",
    "the dispersion relations in fig . [ fig6 ] show large regions where the @xmath80 bands are rather flat .",
    "they give rise to a high and rather narrow peak at @xmath8160@xmath35 ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "this peak is likely to correspond to the frequency @xmath60=65@xmath35 given in the table . in fig . 2 of ref . , the partial contribution of the lead and sulfur vibrations ( i.e. , the eigenvector components ) to the one - phonon dos",
    "is also given .",
    "the large mass difference between these two atoms produces a nearly complete frequency separation of the corresponding vibrations : up to @xmath82@xmath35 the pb atomic displacements dominate whereas the vibrations above 120@xmath35 are basically dominated by the motion of s atoms .",
    "hence the two phonons contributing to the @xmath83@xmath35 band should have a squared vibrational amplitude proportional to ( m@xmath84 ( where m@xmath85 is the atomic mass of the corresponding sulfur isotope ) .",
    "the change of ( m@xmath84 between the two isotopes considered here ( natural s is nearly pure @xmath86s ) is 3% , a value which agrees with the fitted variation in  @xmath62 ( @xmath87=2.6% ) .",
    "the densities of states for the sum and difference of two phonons , as obtained from the @xmath88 @xmath89 dispersion relations , are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "multiplied by the appropriate bose - einstein factors and coupling constants they determine both anharmonic self energies and two phonon raman scattering intensities .",
    "the sharp two - phonon peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] at @xmath81120@xmath35 corresponds to the two phonons ( each at t@xmath90 = 60@xmath35 ) involved in the virtual anharmonic decay of the 430@xmath35 raman excitations .",
    "several factors need to be considered when comparing second - order raman spectra with phonon sum or difference dos . in general , the second - order spectra will resemble ( in part ) the sum dos , i.e. only contributions of two phonons , with @xmath91*k * and @xmath92*k * wave vectors , respectively , and either the same ( overtones ) of different ( combinations ) frequencies .",
    "this is , in fact , how the calculated sum dos was generated : it contains both overtones and combinations .",
    "although there are many more combinations ( 5@xmath166=30 ) than overtones ( 6 ) for each * k * , the overtones seen are often enhanced by the coupling constants ( i.e. matrix elements)@xcite . a detailed comparison of the raman spectra with the two - phonon dos is not justified without the introduction of possibly resonant optical matrix elements and anharmonic self - energies .",
    "however , peaks and other structures observed in the two - phonon dos may find their counterparts in features observed in the raman spectra .",
    "the sets of phonons responsible for the calculated features can be identified by comparison with the dispersion relations .",
    "anharmonic shifts can then be introduced by taking into account the difference between calculated and ins - measured phonon frequencies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    besides the main @xmath81430@xmath35 band",

    "@xcite .",
    "we make the following tentative assignments of both the main and secondary features :    * the experimental curves have a small ( but discernible ) feature at about @xmath94 .",

    "@xcite , which were not taken at low temperatures , did not allow a clear identification of the shoulder at about @xmath100 which could be due to two - phonon scattering .",
    "in fact , both features at @xmath101 could correspond to two - phonon scattering , and it is hard to distinguish this assignment from that to a forbidden @xmath30 scattering situation .",
    "the sharp peak at @xmath102 in the calculated sum dos corresponds to @xmath33 phonons either along @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",

    "in addition , @xmath33 at both @xmath103 and @xmath96 should give a feature at @xmath102 .",
    "with suitable weighting by matrix elements , all these assignments may play a role in the raman feature observed around 210 @xmath35 . *",
    "combination scattering of @xmath107 along @xmath104 would give ( from the experimental values ) @xmath108 , or @xmath109 along @xmath96 .",

    "* the broad peak in the calculated sum dos centered at @xmath111 could be twice the ( theoretical ) low @xmath112 along sigma and have no connection with the experimental phonons ( there are no ins points around @xmath113 and therefore we do not expect a feature at @xmath114 in the experiment ) .",
    "the actual @xmath112 seems to be lower , possibly because of the anharmonic shift . *",
    "finally , the asymmetric broad experimental band at @xmath115 , whose temperature dependence we discussed in the previous section ( fig .

    "any peak whose intensity vanishes as @xmath93 approaches the lowest possible temperature ( 12k in our case ) is a strong candidate to be compared with the difference dos .",
    "we do not see any feature that could safely be assigned to the difference dos , which exhibits strong structures at 30 , 90 and 140@xmath35 .",

    "another aspect we have already touched upon concerns the interpretation of the unusual frequency up - shift of the @xmath127 feature in fig . [ fig5 ] due to virtual anharmonic decay into two phonons .",
    "the sign of this coefficient , corresponding to a ",

    "the @xmath129 modes are all s - like , whereas the 60@xmath35 phonons are lead - like .",

    "the measured shift , as listed in the table , is also 3% .",
    "we note that we have estimated a somewhat smaller shift ( 2% ) for the measured spectra of the @xmath133 band .",
    "although the difference between this shift and that of the square roots of the sulfur masses ( 3% ) lies probably within the experimental error , it would be easy to justify it in terms of the theoretical expectation : for the one-@xmath30 scattering the shift should be determined by the reduced mass of pb and s and amount to 2.6% . in the case of scattering by two phonons , with frequencies around @xmath134 , which fall in the region which separates pb - like from s - like vibrations ,",
    "a shift smaller than that predicted from the sulfur mass can be expected but it is difficult to estimate quantitatively .",
    "we have measured the raman spectra of two pbs samples , one made out of natural galena and the other a synthetic crystal with natural sulfur replaced by @xmath42s , in the 150 - 500@xmath35 spectral region at temperatures between 10 and 120k .",
