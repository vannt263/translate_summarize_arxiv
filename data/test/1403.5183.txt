    "heavy ions colliding at ultrarelativistic energies produce a tiny fireball of a plasma of quarks and gluons  the state of matter thought to have existed slightly after the big bang .",
    "this experimental program started at the sps in the 1980s , continued at rhic and it is now running at the lhc , where the experiments alice , atlas and cms are collecting and analyzing data from the collisions of lead nuclei .",
    "the most recent runs reached temperatures of about 500 mev  approximately @xmath2 k  well above the temperature of the crossover from ordinary matter to the plasma of quarks and gluons , estimated to be at about 155 mev @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the transition from ordinary matter to the quark - gluon plasma , and the nature of the plasma itself  the spectral properties and the residual interactions  is a very active field of theoretical research @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with temperatures well above those where the synthesis of the lightest nuclei takes place , so strong interactions alone suffice to describe the system . hence , the appropriate microscopic description is the relativistic field theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics , qcd .",
    "we also know that @xmath3 , the qcd coupling at the scale of the temperatures of interest , can be as large as 0.5 and even larger , so that perturbation theory , which will ultimately be valid for very high temperatures , does not work , at least quantitatively , in the region which we wish to explore here .",
    "we therefore need a non - perturbative method , and we choose numerical simulations of qcd discretized on a lattice .",
    "this note is devoted to the presentation of lattice results obtained by the fastsum collaboration , in particular those appearing in refs .",
    "it updates and expands previous reviews @xcite .",
    "why is bottomonium such an interesting probe of the medium ?",
    "we will be concerned with phenomena occurring at , or above , the crossover to a chirally symmetric , deconfined phase . in general",
    "both chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement affect the spectrum of the theory : chiral symmetry will be seen in the light sector , by the degeneracy of the chiral partners .",
    "the heavier quarks , however , will be blind to chiral symmetry : @xmath4 . for instance only about 15% of the strange mass is due to the breaking of chiral symmetry , and for charm and bottom",
    "this contribution is completely negligible  modifications of the spectrum of charmonia and bottomonia come entirely from the gauge dynamics . in very short summary , then , quarkonia are ideal probes of the gluodynamics . since their size is small , however , the sensitivity to deconfinement is not immediate : the short - range component of the potential , which is responsible for their binding , and hence the fundamental bound states , might well survive in the plasma , while the excited states dissolve .",
    "we talk of sequential suppression of quarkonia , and the goal of our studies is to make quantitative these very qualitative considerations .",
    "charmonia  which are easier to produce experimentally  have been studied since early sps days .",
    "we know by now @xcite that the experimental results for charmonia are also sensitive to cold nuclear matter effects which reduce the primordial charmonium number significantly  for instance by about 60% at sps .",
    "there are also competing temporal scales  thermalization of the plasma and formation time of the bound states , as well as the intriguing observation that charmonia production rates at sps and rhic are quite similar .",
    "the latter effect can be at least in part explained by taking into account a regeneration mechanism for charmonia ( feed - down ) : the higher dissociation rate at rhic is compensated by a richer feed - down .",
    "all these considerations make the study of charmonium suppression patterns extremely fascinating but also challenging .",
    "bottomonium production , on the other hand , is much less prone to regeneration effects , and as such is a more promising observable for the spectral analysis of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma@xcite .",
    "since bottomonium production requires the larger energies available at the lhc , such data have become available only very recently . in the last few years",
    ", results showing sequential upsilon suppression in pbpb collision at lhc energies have appeared @xcite , and we will comment on those at the end .",
    "lattice calculations are performed in a discretized euclidean space - time , which introduces technical scales : the lattice spacing @xmath5 and the lattice spatial size , @xmath6 . each characteristic physical scale _",
    "l _ should obviously fulfil the constraint @xmath7 .",
    "accommodating quarks with vastly different masses then poses a computational challenge .    our strategy is to treat as accurately as possible the light quarks : in all our studies gauge configurations with dynamical light wilson - type quark flavours are produced on highly anisotropic lattices .",
    "details of the lattice action and parameters can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath8 quarks we use non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) . in our work",
    "we use a mean - field improved action with tree - level coefficients , which includes terms up to and including @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the typical velocity of a bottom quark in bottomonium,@xmath11 .",
    "there is no ( rest ) mass term in the nrqcd action so one can dispense with the demanding constraint @xmath12 . in general , nrqcd relies on the separation of scales between the bottom quark and any other physical scale of the theory : in our work we study temperatures up to @xmath13 mev , hence @xmath14 and the application of nrqcd is fully justified .",
    "in our studies we considered the @xmath15 wave states @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the @xmath18 wave states @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we found that the correlators in the different @xmath18 wave channels behave in a very similar way , hence from now on for the @xmath18 wave states we present results for the @xmath20 channel only .",
    "the gauge configurations are generated with a dynamical first generation of quarks .",
    "more recently the strange quark has been added as well@xcite : the general features of the results are unchanged , and a systematic , detailed analysis of the effect of a dynamical strange quark is in progress .     for the @xmath16 ( left ) and @xmath20 ( center ) , as a function of euclidean time for various temperatures .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=158,height=188 ]    there is a further important simplification in nrqcd : to compute propagators we only need to solve an initial value problem , in contrast to the relativistic case where the same computation requires the inversion of a large sparse matrix . in the hadronic phase",
    "we expect that the large euclidean time behaviour of the propagators is dominated by an exponential decay . in the qgp phase , one can use as guidance the behaviour found for free quarks in nrqcd @xcite , which yields the spectral functions @xmath24 here we supplemented @xcite the free results by a threshold , @xmath25 , to account for the additive shift in the quarkonium energies which describes the residual interactions in the thermal medium .",
    "the correlation functions then have the following behaviour @xmath26 to visualize the temperature dependence and at the same time monitor the approach to a quasi - free behaviour we construct effective power plots @xcite , using the definition @xmath27 where the prime denotes the ( discretized ) derivative .",

    "[ fig : power ] .",
    "we see that the @xmath16 displays a very mild temperature dependence , while for the @xmath20 the asymptotic behaviour of the effective power tends to flatten out with increasing temperature : this indicates that @xmath25  the slope  decreases with temperature . in the same panel also shown are the effective exponents in the continuum non - interacting limit ( @xmath30 ) . in the case of the @xmath20 ,",
    "we observe that the effective exponent  which can be read off the intercept of the asympotic straight line with the @xmath31 axis  seems to approach the non - interacting result .",
    "note that , even for @xmath32 where @xmath33 , the effective exponents on the lattice only become a straight line , @xmath34 , at large enough @xmath35 due to the presence of lattice discretisation effects at smaller temporal separations .",

    "when the correlator takes the form of a sum of exponentials , the ground state will show up as a plateau at large euclidean times , provided that it is well separated from the excited states .",
    "this is indeed the case at the lowest temperature and leads to the zero - temperature spectrum discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . above @xmath37",
    ", we observe that the effective masses no longer follow the trend given by the correlator below @xmath37 , but instead bend away from the low - temperature data .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] imply that the spectrum of the @xmath20 has changed drastically . if isolated bound states persist , the ground state has to be much lighter and excited states can not be well separated .",

    "since the interesting physics takes place around the two - quark threshold , @xmath47 , the region of interest is around @xmath48 and the lower limit becomes irrelevant . in summary ,",
    "in the heavy - quark limit the spectral relation simplifies considerably , and temperature effects seen in the correlators are thus only due to changes in the light - quark  gluon system .    despite these simplifications ,",
    "the calculation of the nrqcd spectral functions using euclidean propagators as an input remains a difficult , ill - defined problem .",
    "we will tackle it by using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite , which has proven successful in a variety of applications .",

[",
    "fig : rho_all_upsilon ] , which shows that as the temperature is increased the ground state peaks of both states remain visible .",

    "this lends further support to the conclusion drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite from an analysis of the correlators : the system in the @xmath18 wave channels is approaching a system of noninteracting quarks , and the residual interactions can be described by a shift in the quarkonium energies , which does not affect the shape of spectral functions .",
