    "an open question is the frequency range over which to search for extra - terrestrial intelligence @xcite .",
    "the frequency range from 1 to 10  g@xmath2 is generally preferred , however after decades this range is still very much unexplored @xcite . for leakage signals ,",

    "in addition , @xcite proposed to use vlbi or space - vlbi satellites to measure the angular size of suspected seti radio sources .",
    "pseudo - interferometric observations were conducted by the seti institute , using both the arecibo telescope and the lovell telescope , jodrell bank observatory between 1200 and 1750  @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the survey searched for signals from nearby stars with appropriate frequency drift and offset caused by the rotation of the earth .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) is human - made , unwanted radio emission within the telescope s field of view .",
    "potential sources include mobile phones , radars , television signals , fm - radio , satellites etc .",
    "separating rfi from a real seti signal is one of the most challenging problems faced by seti projects .",
    "thousands of hours of computing time are spent identifying and removing rfi from the datasets , before one can search for seti signals . since its inception",
    ", the seti@home project has detected over 4.2 billion potential signals .",
    "while essentially all these potential signals are rfi , it is possible that therein lies a true extraterrestrial signal @xcite .",
    "vlbi offers several ways of discriminating rfi signals from seti signals not applicable to single dish or even short baseline radio interferometers .",
    "first , vlbi uses _ n _ telescopes separated by hundreds to thousands of kilometres giving @xmath11 baselines , once the data from independent pairs of telescopes are correlated together .",
    "this aspect of vlbi is important , as rfi which is not present at both telescopes involved in a baseline does not correlate .",
    "an astronomical or seti compact radio source within the interferometer field of view will be detected on all baselines .",
    "this is also true for rfi if it is detectable by both telescopes in a baseline .",
    "however , even correlated rfi can be easily identified with vlbi , as it produces distinct phase variations in both frequency and time in the correlated output as discussed below .",
    "the correlated signals from an interferometer are complex quantities ( known as visibilities ) , with amplitude and phase as the fundamental observables .",
    "the amplitudes are proportional to the correlated power of the source , while the phase , @xmath12 represents the residual time delay that results from the wavefront of the radio emission arriving at one antenna before the other . at the centre of the field of view",
    "( also known as the phase centre ) , the delay ( and hence the phase ) is set to zero , via application of a _ a priori _ time delay , @xmath13 , at the correlator .",
    "this time delay accounts for many different effects , but primarily simple geometry .",
    "the phase , @xmath12 of a radio point source offset from the phase centre can then be related to its position relative from the phase centre , and is given by  1 from @xcite ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the observing frequency , _",
    "l _ and _ m _ are the coordinates of the source in the plane of the sky , relative to the phase centre , and _ u _ and _ v _ are coordinates which describe the instantaneous geometry of the projected baseline , with respect to the phase centre .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for details . for a finite observational bandwidth , and for the duration of the observation",
    ", the radio source in  [ eq : deltaphi ] will display a phase change with frequency and time given by ,    @xmath16    @xmath17    by measuring the phase change with time and frequency for a given source , its location with respect to the phase centre can be determined using the above equations .",
    "additionally , if the source s position is known , maximum values for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be determined , using maximum values of @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath19 or @xmath18 for a radio source can be determined by the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the complex visibilities . for narrow - band ( persistent or intermittent in time ) and broad - band signals",
    ", dfts can be applied to the complex visibilities as a function of time to determine @xmath19 and frequency to determine @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "this method is illustrated in  [ fig : fft ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the phase of a narrow - band test signal as a function of time , with a sample time of 5  minutes per point over a 40  minute observation .",
    "the lower panel displays the corresponding discrete power spectrum obtained by applying dfts to the complex visibilities",
    ".    a signal with little or no phase change in time or frequency ( implying a source close to the phase centre ) will appear in bin zero .",
    "however , a signal with high phase change with time ( as the test signal in  [ fig : fft ] ) is indicative of a source far from the phase centre , probably rfi , and will appear in a different bin .",
    "the height of the dft amplitude of bin zero compared with the others gives an indication of the signal to noise of any signal which comes from the phase centre .",
    "there are , however , ambiguities in signals with @xmath19 greater than the nyquist frequency . the component of the test signal located in the @xmath243 bin can be generalised as @xmath19 = @xmath25per data point , where @xmath26 is a a wide range of positive and negative integers .",
    "the @xmath19 of the nyquist bin , due to ambiguities is @xmath27180per data point .",
    "gl581 was observed on 2007 june 19 , for 8 hours in the 20  cm wavelength band by three stations of the long baseline array ( lba ) : mopra ( mp ) , parkes ( pa ) and the australia telescope compact array ( at ) in phased array mode .",
    "the observation was conducted in three frequency pairs of 64 m@xmath2 bandwidth centred on : 1262,1312 ; 1362,1412 ; 1462,1512 m@xmath2 , in dual - polarisation mode .",
    "the uv coverage is shown in  [ fig : uvplot ] .",

    "the longest baseline of our observation ( at - pa ) is a factor of 9 less than the longest vlba baseline , hence , 1510 - 089 is expected to be unresolved in our observations .",
    "a phase - referencing cycle of 5 minutes ( 2 minutes on calibrator , 3 minutes on gl581 ) was employed .",
    "a single observation block consisted of 8@xmath305 minute phase - referencing cycles .",
    "the entire observation comprised 12@xmath3040  minute observational blocks switching between the three frequency pairs (  1 ) .",
    "the data were correlated using the difx software correlator @xcite , with a frequency resolution of 1.95 k@xmath2 per spectral channel , and converted to the standard fits - idi format .",
    "the lowest and highest 5  m@xmath2 ( 2500 channels ) were discarded from each band due to band edge drop - off in sensitivity .",
    "the data files were then sub - divided into five datasets of 4000 channels each and one dataset of 1268 channels at each centre frequency .      due to its proximity to earth , the exact coordinates of gl581 at the time of observation",

    "this calculation has a positional uncertainty of 53  mas , largely due to the cumulative effect of the uncertainty in the proper motion measured by the _ hipparcos _",

    "the data reduction and calibration was performed using the national radio astronomical observatory ( nrao ) software package _ _ aips__. prior to calibration and data analysis , the phase centre of the calibrator was shifted , via the _ aips _ task _ uvfix _ , to match the calculated positional difference .",
    "flagging and phase - only calibration ( fringe - fitting and self - calibration ) were carried out on the phase centre shifted calibrator .",

    "the uncertainty in the position of gl581 ( 53  mas ) and the semi - major axes of the planets ( gl581d = 40  mas and gl581 g = 23  mas ) produces a quadratic error of 66  mas and 57  mas on the positions of gl581d and gl581 g , respectively .",

    "such a slow varying signal is expected to behave as a signal from the phase centre , where most of its power appears in bin zero of the dft power spectrum on the three baselines .    to determine whether any of the signals are from the gl581 system ,",
    "classical detection theory was employed to test the hypothesis that the signal is located at the phase centre .",
    "hypothesis testing compares the likelihood that any given signal is consistent with a source located at the phase centre , to the likelihood that it is consistent with a source located away from the phase centre , or from rfi .",

    "in addition , given that we expect the primary signals in the data to be rfi , rather than true signals , we also simulate zero - mean gaussian noise with random rfi spikes located at a single time point in the visibilities .",

    "most of the 200 signals were found to have a p - value greater than 0.01 , with ten signals having a p - value of @xmath54 0.01 .",
    "eight signals lie between both distributions ( @xmath55\\,<$ ]  35 ) .",
    "these signals are strictly inconsistent with both hypotheses , and reflect the limitations of our simple analysis ; namely the simulation of data with either pure signals at the phase centre , or a single rfi peak in the visibility , and the need for the overall test statistic to have a value in excess of the threshold , rather than those for the individual baselines .",

    "should be noted .",
    "firstly the baseline lengths in this experiment were short by vlbi standards .",
    "baselines one or even two orders of magnitude longer would significantly reduce the amount of correlated rfi .",
    "secondly , most vlbi observations are carried out using more than three telescopes . increasing the number of baselines to four or more",
    "constrains both the phase and amplitude closure relations , drastically increasing the quality of calibration .",
    "this would also provide the opportunity for image plane searching .",
    "however , it would likely be computationally expensive as a technique for searching over very wide frequency ranges . relaxing the single baseline five times median limit",
    "could enhance the sensitivity beyond that of the weakest baseline .",
    "we should also note that the width of the dft bin is not a fundamental limit on the determination of the phase variation . a least - squares fit would allow the delay and delay rate to be determined more accurately .",
    "essentially , the error on these parameters is limited by the signal to noise . certainly the lba has been used for astrometry at the sub - milliarcsecond level @xcite .",
    "observations of spacecraft have proven vlbi astrometry techniques for very weak narrow - band sources @xcite and suggest that vlbi might even allow the detection of the orbital motion of seti signals .",
    "while the techniques discussed in this paper are ideal for targeted seti , we also note the possibility of carrying out seti commensally with normal vlbi operations .",
    "seti target stars @xcite would be expected to be present in the field of view of the antennas for vlbi observations reasonably regularly . using the techniques discussed in @xcite and @xcite it would be possible to produce visibility datasets for any target star in the primary beam .",
    "additionally , direct analysis of the voltages ( the baseband data ) although computationally expensive , could also be implemented at the correlator in an efficient manner to search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence .",
    "a possible model for this is the vfastr transient search currently running at the vlba operations centre @xcite .",
    "a sensitive and advanced radio telescope , the square kilometre array ( ska ) is currently being planned for the coming decades .    at 1400  @xmath0",
    ", the long baselines of the ska will provide an astrometric precision of @xmath53  @xmath65-arcseconds @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ska is expected to achieve sub-@xmath65jy sensitivities @xcite . at @xmath520",
    "ly the ska would probe an isotropic luminosity of a few @xmath66 , far below the power output of radars and telecommunication satellites @xcite .",
    "the fields of view will be @xmath51 square degree at the maximum baselines and @xmath530 square degrees for the shorter baselines @xcite .",
    "these capabilities will make the ska the fastest , most sensitive and widest field of view survey instrument in astronomy .",
    "however , for the ska to be used for seti , suitable targets are required .",
    "such targets are currently being provided by the kepler mission @xcite .",
    "the discoveries of potential habitable planets are no doubt fuelling a renewed excitement in seti . with current vlbi systems we are able to search these candidates for signals from extra - terrestrial civilizations over a wide range of frequencies , and with high sensitivity .",
    "in addition , vlbi is undergoing a transition from traditional recording systems towards real - time correlation via network connections ( so called e - vlbi ) .",
    "this has led to vlbi being used for rapid follow - up of transient sources .",
    "these developments , the wide range of frequencies covered by vlbi instruments , and the huge added value that vlbi techniques bring to a targeted seti search make vlbi the natural choice for follow - up observations to confirm a potential seti signal .",
    "however , more accurate positions are needed for target stars for future experiments with higher angular resolution .",
    "such positions will be provided in the near future by the high - quality optical astrometry of _ gaia _ @xcite .",
