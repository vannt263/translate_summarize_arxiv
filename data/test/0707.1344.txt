    "principal extensions can be considered as functors from the category of finite - dimensional corepresentations of the hopf algebra ( replacing the structure group ) to the category of finitely generated projective modules over the coaction - invariant subalgebra ( playing the role of the base space ) .",
    "the aim of this article is to establish a viable concept of locality of comodule algebras and analyse its relationship with principality .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "recall that not all properties of group actions are local in nature : there is a natural example of a locally proper action of @xmath14 on @xmath15 that is not proper ( see @xcite , cf .",

    "a group action is free if and only if it is locally free .",
    "therefore , since for compact groups all actions are proper , the principal ( i.e. , free and proper ) actions of compact groups are local in nature .",
    "our main result ( theorem  [ main ] ) is a noncommutative analogue of this statement : a comodule algebra @xmath0 which is covered by `` pieces '' @xmath5 is principal if and only if so are the pieces . in particular , a smash product of an @xmath1-module algebra @xmath16 with the hopf algebra @xmath1 ( with bijective antipode ) is principal , so that gluing together smash products is a way of constructing principal comodule algebras .",
    "however , it was pointed out in @xcite that the aforementioned coverings can show a certain incompleteness when going beyond the @xmath6-setting .",

    "hence we analyse a stronger notion of covering that includes this nontrivial assumption as part of the definition ( see definition  [ covdef ] ) . if all @xmath5 s are smash products , we arrive at a concept of piecewise trivial comodule algebras .",
    "they appear to be a good noncommutative replacement of locally trivial compact principal bundles .",
    "our motivation for going beyond @xmath6-algebras comes from the way we consider compact principal bundles ( the hausdorff property assumed ) .",
