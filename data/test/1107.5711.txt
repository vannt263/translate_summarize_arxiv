    "non - newtonian fluids peculiar dynamics has focused a large attention over the last decades . their ability to flow or break @xcite , to exhibit viscous or elastic behavior @xcite , thixotropy effects @xcite or to sustain loads without flowing",
    "@xcite opened a wide range of applications , including cosmetics , food industry , environment and biology . among them , micellar fluids differ from polymers by their internal dynamics : they continuously break and restructurate @xcite , and their internal kinetics determines their length distribution - and , hence , their macroscopic properties @xcite .",
    "the behavior of bubbles rising through such fluids is complex , due , in particular , to the non - trivial coupling between the bubble and the fluid rheology @xcite .",
    "this has prevented , up to now , a complete theoretical description of the system , and favored experimental studies . due to the viscoelastic properties , the bubble shape is generally elongated @xcite , its tail ends by a cusp @xcite , and both its geometry and velocity oscillate during its rising through the fluid @xcite . in shear - thinning fluids , the local perturbation due to a rising bubble - or a falling sphere - creates a negative wake @xcite and a corridor of reduced viscosity @xcite . as a consequence , successive bubbles may interact one with the other @xcite , if the emission period is shorter than the time for the perturbation created by the bubble to vanish .",
    "an extensive study of the degassing regimes when a constant air flux is imposed at the bottom of a complex , yield - stress fluid column ( gel or immersed granular material ) has revealed the existence of three different regimes @xcite . on the one hand , at low flow - rate , bubbles rise independently one from the other . on the other hand , at high flow - rate , an open channel connects the bottom nozzle to the fluid surface ; this channel develops instabilities , forming a ` bubble chain ' @xcite .",
    "finally , at intermediate flow - rate , the system spontaneously oscillates between the two previous regimes , exhibiting a complex intermittent dynamics @xcite .    ) , via a chamber of volume @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 is of the order of a typical bubble diameter ( a few millimeters to centimeters ) . ]    in this article , we extend these previous works to the case of a fluid without yield stress , and for a _ thin _ fluid layer , i.e. , when the fluid height is smaller than the typical size of a bubble .",
    "we report the existence of a peculiar degassing regime in a thin layer of micellar fluid ( ctab / nasal mixture ) .",
    "when a constant air flow is imposed at its bottom , in the bubbling regime , the air is released through periodic series of successive bubbles , hereafter named _",
    "cascades_. when the layer is thin enough , the cascades merely consists in successive opening and closing of the fluid layer above the air injection point . for convenience",
    ", these periodic degassing apertures will also be named _",
    "bubbles _ in the following .",
    "we measure the overpressure at the base of the fluid column , at the injection point .",
    "the main characteristics of the cascades ( periodicity , maximum overpressure ) are analyzed in regards with the fluid rheology .",
    "we show that inside a cascade , the bubble properties vary continuously : the mean overpressure drops , whereas the emission time increases .",
    "the transition between two regimes inside the cascades is directly linked to the fluid rheology and , in particular , provides a direct measurement of the viscoelastic characteristic time associated with the maxwell fluid .",
    "the experimental cell consists of a cylinder made of plexiglass ( diameter 74  mm , height 270  mm ) , filled with the fluid up to a height @xmath1 ( fig .  [ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "air is injected at constant flow - rate @xmath2 ( from 0.17 to 1.72  ml / s ) through an injection hole ( diameter @xmath3  mm ) at the bottom of the fluid column .",
    "the air - injection system consists of a mass - flow controller ( bronkhorst , mass - stream series d-5111 ) connected to a chamber of volume @xmath0 , from which the air flows at the column bottom .",
    "the volume of the chamber can be easily tuned by changing the water level into the chamber ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "the water itself makes it possible to inject humid air inside the fluid , thus avoiding any drying of the sample over the experimental time . a differential pressure sensor ( 223 bd-00010 ab , mks instruments ) measures the variations of the overpressure @xmath4 inside the chamber , corresponding to the pressure variations at the bottom of the cell .",
    "the fluid is a semi - dilute micellar system obtained by a mixing at equimolar concentration , inside pure water , sodium salicylate ( nasal , sigma aldrich ) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( ctab , sigma aldrich ) .",
    "the mixture of this two chemical components causes the formation of a network of giant entangled micelles , which break down and reform continuously @xcite . on a macroscopic point of view , the fluid exhibits shear - thinning , viscoelastic properties @xcite , which can be tuned by varying the fluid concentration @xmath5 ( from 0.03 to 0.5  mol.l@xmath6 ) .",
    "the rheology of these well - controlled mixtures is characterized by rheometer measurements ( see appendix  [ app : rheology ] and [ app : modulii ] ) . the height @xmath1 of the thin layer ranges from 5 to 35  mm . unless specified , the results presented here are for a typical height of 5  mm and a concentration @xmath7  mol.l@xmath6 .",
    "when varying the system parameters ( @xmath8 ) , we observe three different degassing regimes through the thin layer : a _ bubbling _ regime , for which bubbles are emitted one after the other ; an _ open channel _ regime , for which the system is able to sustain a stable channel connecting the injection nozzle at the base of the fluid column to the fluid free surface ; and an _ intermittent _ regime , for which the system alternates spontaneously between the bubbling and the open channel regime  this latter pinching off intermittently .",
    "similar degassing regimes have been reported in yield - stress fluids : gels @xcite or in immersed granular media @xcite .",

    "the gray zone correspond to the space of parameters where bubble cascades are observed [ @xmath13  mm ] . ]    typically , when increasing the injected air flow - rate @xmath2 , all other parameters being constant , the system goes from the bubbling , intermittent and finally open channel regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes ] ) . when increasing the fluid concentration , it becomes easier for the system to sustain an open channel , and it is necessary to go to higher volumes @xmath0 and smaller flow rate @xmath2 to observe the bubbling regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes]a and b ) @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "increasing the fluid column height makes it more difficult to open a channel , and shifts the regime boundaries toward smaller volumes and higher flow rates .",
    "note that the precise boundary between two different regimes is difficult to determine , due to the finite acquisition time ( the system may not have the time to switch from bubbles to an open channel , or vice - versa ) .    the formation of an open - channel can be qualitatively explained .",
    "indeed , due to the fluid shear - thinning properties ( appendix  [ app : rheology ] ) , when a bubble rises through the fluid , its wake is characterized by a local viscosity smaller than the surrounding fluid .",
    "if the flow rate is large enough , the following bubble will rise through a fluid with a smaller effective viscosity  and thus , will rise faster , and so on , until the system is able to sustain an open channel through the fluid column .",
    "note that this channel does not resemble a cylinder , but rather a bubble chain , similar to previous observations in yield - stress and non yield - stress fluids @xcite .",
    "in a wide range of fluid concentration ( from @xmath14 to @xmath15  mol / l ) , when the fluid layer height @xmath1 is of the order of the size of a bubble ( typically , @xmath16  mm ) , we do not observe , in the bubbling regime , successive bubbles but rather periodic series of bubbles , hereafter named _ bubble cascades_. these cascades are clearly observed in the overpressure signal @xmath4 recorded at the bottom of the fluid column ( fig .",

    "this hole then suddenly closes , and the next cascade starts .",
    "the sequence consisting of a bubble cascade followed by a hole opened through the fluid layer repeats periodically in time .",

    "this linear relationship can be explained by a simple heuristic model , based on the key ingredients of the maxwell model ( fig .  [ fig : maxwell ] ) .",

    "the fluid starts flowing and a bubble grows at the tip of the injection hole ( fig .  [",

    "the overpressure then departs from its linear increase , as a consequence of the volume increase due to the bubble growth .    by deriving the general equation for an ideal gas , and denoting @xmath91 the volume of the bubble",
