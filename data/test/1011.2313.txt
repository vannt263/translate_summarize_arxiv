    "cognitive radio ( cr ) is a promising approach to efficiently utilize the scarce rf spectrum resource . in this paradigm ,",
    "knowledge about spectrum occupancy in time , frequency , and space that is both accurate and timely is crucial in allowing cr networks to opportunistically use the spectrum , and avoid interference to a primary user ( pu ) .",
    "in particular , information about pu location will enable several key capabilities in cr networks including improved spatio - temporal sensing , intelligent location - aware routing , as well as aiding spectrum policy enforcement .",
    "the localization problem in cr networks is in general different from localization in other applications such as wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) and global positioning system ( gps ) , in which the target to be localized cooperates with the localization devices .",
    "in contrast , a pu does not communicate directly with the crs during the localization process .",
    "this scenario is referred to as non - cooperative localization and does not allow the use of conventional techniques such as time - of - arrival ( toa ) and time - delay - of - arrival ( tdoa ) ranging .",
    "several techniques have been proposed in the literature for estimating the position of active pus in a cr network .",
    "these schemes include both range - based @xcite and range - free @xcite algorithms .",
    "range - free positioning schemes , such as centroid localization @xcite , have attracted a lot of interest because of their simplicity and robustness to changes in wireless propagation properties such as path loss .",
    "this characteristic makes them suitable candidates for systems requiring coarse - grained , but reliable and cost - effective techniques . on the other hand , range - based techniques such as multi - lateration @xcite ,",
    "offer better estimates , but require accurate information about the target s distance that can only be achieved either through cooperation with the target or a very precise knowledge of the path loss model .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on analyzing the performance of a particular , low complexity , coarse - grained localization algorithm , referred to as weighted centroid localization ( wcl ) @xcite . in this technique , pu location is approximated as the weighted average of all secondary user positions within its transmission range . strictly speaking ,",
    "wcl is not an entirely range - free technique because it requires additional information aside from simple connectivity , namely received signal strength ( rss ) measurements .",
    "wcl and wcl - like methods are suitable for pu localization because of their low computational complexity .",
    "they also do not require cooperation from the pu and only use the readily available rss information .",
    "in addition , wcl always converges to a solution , as opposed to some range - based techniques , and do not require estimation of the path loss exponent beforehand .",
    "recent papers on wcl have proposed improvements on the basic algorithm to enhance its performance for specific scenarios @xcite .",
    "all previous wcl studies reported in the literature have been analyzed either via simulation or field experiments @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , there has been no analysis of the probability distribution of the localization error for even the simplest version of wcl in the presence of shadowing in both wsn and cr literature .",
    "we present the first theoretical analysis of the error distribution of wcl in this paper .",
    "the presented analytical framework models varying levels of shadowing , including both independent and correlated shadowing environments , and also takes inaccuracy of sensor node positioning into consideration . using this analysis in conjunction with numerical simulations we observe and quantify the robustness of wcl to variable channel conditions and node placements .",
    "we also investigate variable node participation as a simple modification that can improve wcl performance .    in the latter part of this paper we propose and investigate a distributed cluster - based implementation of wcl in the context of cr networks .",
    "previous work primarily assumes a centralized fusion node aggregating data from other nodes . in the context of wsn where wcl was first utilized @xcite ,",
    "the primary motivation was node self - localization where a node applies wcl using measurements from beacon nodes in close proximity to it .",
    "this approach naturally dictates a centralized system where the node to be localized acts as the fusion center and only requires minimal interaction with the beacons . in the case of pu localization in cr networks",
    ", however , where the primary motivation is estimating the position of a non - cooperative node , there no longer exists any particular node that has all the requisite information to perform wcl . in this case a fusion node is arbitrarily chosen .",
    "this approach does not scale very well in terms of communication overhead and transmit power , which limits its application to low node densities or small network size .",
    "there is therefore a need to create distributed implementations of wcl for this technique to be practically applied in cr localization .",
    "a standard approach for distributing control in sensor networks is clustering .",
    "several algorithms exist in the literature for creating either disjoint @xcite or overlapping @xcite clusters . in @xcite , a distributed technique based on the concept of mean - shift @xcite",
    ". however , the technique requires repeatedly forming a virtual cluster until it converges to the target location .",
    "this introduces additional communication overhead and also requires several iterations to converge .",
    "we present an implementation which saves total transmit power needed for localization process communication , and investigate its accuracy as well as its effect on per node computational complexity and total transmit power consumption .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section [ sec : systemmodel ] .",
    "the theoretical analysis of centralized wcl accuracy is presented in section [ sec : analysis ] , while a practical and distributed implementation of wcl is proposed and analyzed in section [ sec : distributed ] .",
    "numerical results for various scenarios used to evaluate performance of wcl algorithms are presented in section [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section presents the general framework for our analysis .",
    "we first review the assumptions about the system setting and propagation model , and then present the basic wcl algorithm .",
    "we adopt the pu - centric model @xcite in which the pu transmitter is assumed to be at the center area of a circle .",
    "the rationale behind this choice is that in a practical scenario , sensor nodes that obtain enough received power ( i.e. above sensitivity threshold ) approximately form a circle around the primary transmitter .",
    "thus , sensors within this circle are used to jointly estimate the position of the pu . an implicit assumption in this model",
    "is that the pu is surrounded by enough nodes so that edge effects can be disregarded .",
    "assume @xmath0 sensor nodes in a circle of fixed radius @xmath1 .",
    "the number of sensors within the circle is jointly affected by several factors , such as transmit power of the pu ( which effectively determines @xmath1 ) , node density , node selection methodology , etc .",
    "@xmath0 is a design parameter for wcl deployment , the choice of which will have significant influence on the localization accuracy , as will be shown in our analysis .",
    "the pu located at the center has a coordinate defined as @xmath2^t=[0 , 0]^t$ ] . for the @xmath3th sensor node , we define its 2-dimensional location as @xmath4^t$ ] where @xmath5 .",
    "sensors are placed independently in both dimensions .",
    "we assume sensors obtain information about their own locations , which is modeled as imperfect .",
    "the measured location of the @xmath3th sensor is distributed as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 defines standard deviation of the error in sensor node self - localization .",
    "we further assume the self - localization errors are independent among sensors and are independent from received powers .",
    "we adopt the following channel model for received signal strength used in wcl .",
    "the received power of the @xmath3th node from the primary transmitter , @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 in which the first two terms characterize path loss and the last term describes shadowing effect .",
    "the path loss is characterized by three constants : reference power @xmath10 , reference distance @xmath11 and path loss exponent @xmath12 .",
    "denote collection of shadowing variables as @xmath13 $ ] , then its distribution is characterized by @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the following shadowing cases    _ = _ s^2 * i_n , & i.i.d case , + \\{_}_ij = _",
    "i-_j /x_c , & correlated case , [ shadowing ] *    where @xmath15 is the correlation distance @xcite within which the shadowing effects of nodes are correlated , and @xmath16 is the identity matrix with dimension @xmath0 .    the theoretical analysis presented in section [ sec : analysis ] is based on the centralized architecture , which will also give us an upper bound on the performance . in each localization period , all sensors involved in the wcl will send their rss measurements to the fusion center , where an estimate will be made about the coordinate of the primary transmitter . the considered algorithm is a modification of relative - span wcl proposed in @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the weights are guaranteed to be non - negative in db scale .",

    "this causes large communication overhead in terms of number of messages and transmit power consumption when implemented in a centralized manner .",
    "we now present a practical distributed implementation of wcl to address this problem in the context of cr networks .",
    "clustering is commonly used in implementation of distributed algorithms . the challenge in designing these algorithms is to reduce the amount of information exchanged among clusters .",
    "the proposed algorithm accomplishes this by splitting the task into two phases .",

    "this particular algorithm is based on geographic boundaries and generates clusters which have a predefined shape ( hexagonal in this case ) .",
    "the regularity in the shape of the cluster is beneficial for the first step of the distributed algorithm since wcl works best for a radially symmetric distribution of nodes .",
    "however , the proposed algorithm would work for any arbitrary clustering algorithm as long as nodes are clustered based on proximity .",
    "the pu is assumed to be randomly placed in the entire area and can thus be in any of these clusters .",
    "each cluster selects one node , @xmath114 , to be the cluster head .",
    "the cluster head maintains a table of all adjacent clusters , @xmath115 , and the location of its member nodes , @xmath116 .",
    "once a pu is detected by a node , using an existing pu detection method such as energy detection @xcite , it transmits its rss measurement to the corresponding cluster head which then participates in the distributed wcl algorithm outlined in the next section . using a predetermined fusion rule , such as a majority vote ,",
    "the cluster head makes a decision on the presence of the pu .",

    "this is done in a distributed manner by comparing the average rss between neighboring clusters . however , directly implementing this procedure would require a large amount of inter - cluster communication .    to solve this issue , a cluster only communicates its average rss to the neighboring cluster , @xmath119 , in the direction of the pu relative to the cluster s centroid .    although techniques for estimating the angle of arrival of a transmitter could be beneficial , these methods require cluster heads to have multiple antennas which increases complexity of sensors . in order to get an approximation of the pu direction",
    ", we propose a metric , @xmath120 , shown in line 5 of algorithm [ alg : selection ] .",
    "we get @xmath120 by subtracting the wcl result of all nodes within the same cluster from the geometric centroid of those nodes .",
    "this vector approximates the rss gradient within the cluster .",
    "it corresponds to an approximate direction of the pu since on average the rss in ( [ received power ] ) decreases as distance to pu increases .",
    "therefore , the negative of the gradient is directed towards the point with maximum rss .",
    "once the cluster with the highest average rss is selected , algorithm [ alg : mwcl ] is performed . in this step",

    "there has been a lot of work such as @xcite , which discussed how to incorporate past observations of the target position and a mobility model to improve localization .",
    "however , applying these methods introduces complexity to wcl and defeats the purpose of such a low complexity scheme .    intuitively , assuming the pu continuously transmits during successive wcl estimations",

    "note that this gain saturates at approximately 200 nodes or more .",
    "we also observe that wcl is quite robust to shadowing , since for an additional @xmath166 of shadowing from @xmath167 to @xmath168 , normalized error increases only 5% .",

    "we conclude that when all nodes are included in the wcl calculation , correlation has a degrading effect to accuracy .",

    "the previous subsections considered fixed node placement and pu location . realistically",
    ", node placement can be random and the pu also appears at random locations relative to the sensor nodes .",
    "next we consider two cases of random node placement : random grid and uniformly distributed placement .    in the random grid scenario , the sensor nodes are still on a grid , but the pu can appear uniformly within the center box .",
    "a grid distribution of nodes can be practically implemented if nodes are explicitly deployed for the purpose of acting as a dedicated localization sensor network .",

    "for both placements , @xmath174 .",
    "]      the results given so far assumed an ideal circular coverage area for the pu .",
    "works such as @xcite indicated that in practical scenarios , the circular model can not be guarranteed due to several non - idealities such as fading , shadowing , and interference in the system .",
    "intuitively , the degree - of - irregularity ( _ doi _ ) parameter determines how closely the coverage area can be approximated by a circle . _",
    "= 0 means the transmission range is perfectly circular .",

    "the result shows that _ doi _ between 0% and 40% increases the error by 4% .",
    "_ doi _ is not a significant impairment for wcl because nodes closest to the pu , where the effect of irregularity is negligible , are weighted more than nodes closer to the edge of the coverage area . however , a slight increase in the normalized mean error can be observed as more nodes are used at high doi ( 30% or 40% ) .",
    "the denser the node distribution , the more nodes are included in wcl , but the more nodes there are , the more deviation from a perfect circular coverage coverage area , leading to lower accuracy .     with varying degree - of - irregularity ( doi ) . for this scenario ,",

    "[ fig : randomgridanduniformrandomplacement ] we observe that in correlated shadowing increasing the number of nodes also increases the error .",
    "one solution to this problem is to reduce the number of participating nodes used in wcl for this scenario .",
    "this could be achieved by ignoring nodes farther away from the pu to reduce the number of nodes resulting in less degradation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : varyingparticipation ] we investigate varying levels of node participation for a fixed average node spacing , @xmath164 . in this case",
    "the total number of nodes is 100 , and the density remains the same while the number of involving nodes is varied .",
    "to select which nodes are included in the wcl calculation , nodes are sorted according to their rss values .",
    "the nodes with high received power are included in wcl . as a result , increasing the participation for the uncorrelated case always improves the accuracy .",
    "thus , 100% participation is optimal .",
    "however , even with a little correlation , this number is greatly reduced and about 10% of the total number of nodes is optimal .",
    "another selection scheme was previously proposed in @xcite where only nodes whose rss is within 15% of the stronges node s rss are used .",
    "the localization accuracy of wcl is also compared to other techniques suitable for cr scenarios .",
    "this includes lateration , centroid and strongest node ( sn ) .",
    "lateration is a range - based technique that uses least - squares estimation using distance estimates to the target . the centroid algorithm , on the other hand",
    ", is a range - free technique which calculates the average of all node positions in range of the pu .",
    "finally , the sn technique simply selects the node with the highest rss and uses its location as an estimate of the pu position .",
    "results in fig .",
    "[ fig : comaprison with other techiques ] show that wcl performs better under higher @xmath161 compared to lateration .",
    "although this seems counter - intuitive at first , the result can be explained by taking note that range - based techniques require an accurate estimate of the distance to the target to provide accurate results . in the case of non - interactive localization ,",
    "where the only available information is the rss from the pu , shadowing induces a very large error in the range estimates . under low shadowing ( @xmath178 db ) , the lateration method is more accurate than wcl . at 0 db",
    "shadowing ( not shown in the figure ) , the range - based technique will achieve perfect localization .",
    "this result supports the claim that wcl is a viable method in the context of non - interactive localization because of its robustness .",
    "the centroid algorithm performs slightly worse than wcl because it does not utilize rss information .",
    "however , the performance difference becomes smaller at higher level of shadowing .    .",
    "for this scenario , nodes are uniformly and independently distributed ( uniform random placement ) in an area with @xmath175 ( uncorrelated shadowing ) .",
    "note that the centroid technique is unaffected by @xmath179 . ]",
    "[ fig : dwcl compare ] presents simulation results that compare normalized mean error of cwcl , sn and dwcl under different shadowing environments .",
    "sn is included in the comparison because it forms the basis of the head cluster selection for dwcl so it acts as an upperbound to the error .",
    "we observe that the proposed dwcl performance is between cwcl and sn algorithms .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the accuracy of dwcl degrades relative to cwcl and approaches the performance of sn when shadowing is high .",
    "the reason behind this is that for cluster head selection , dwcl is dependent on the sn algorithm .",

    "the analysis also shows that transmit power of each node is reduced as the number of node increases , since the average communication distance is getting smaller in dwcl .",
    "[ fig : fixgrid_cpu_theo ] compares computational complexity estimated in terms of number of ops .",
