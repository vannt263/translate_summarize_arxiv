    "although physically realizable potentials are inherently soft , theoretical models usually focus on hard potentials since they allow for analytical solutions .",
    "billiard systems with hard walls are one example of such theoretical models and have been extensively study and well understood .",
    "for example , it is well know @xcite that the motion of three particles on a frictionless ring with point - like interactions is equivalent to the motion of one particle moving freely inside the triangular billiard which hard walls . in such description",
    "the hard - walls potentials are represented by @xmath0-functions which makes the collisions with the walls very simple , and analytical results can be obtained for the real dynamics and also in the tangent space .",
    "however , not much has been done in the description of the transition from hard to soft interactions .",
    "soft walls apparently do not destroy trajectories found in the hard - wall limit @xcite and induce the appearance of regular islands in phase space @xcite .",
    "some works about the dynamics in soft billiard have to be mentioned , one particle motion in an atom - optic billiard @xcite , quantum conductance in the soft wall microwave billiard  @xcite , the effect of wall roughness in granular poiseuille flow  @xcite and how the confinement of the equilibrium hard - sphere fluid to restrictive one- and two - dimensional channels with soft interacting walls modifies its structure , dynamics , and entropy  @xcite and nonlinear dynamics in general @xcite",
    ".    there is a key issue for an appropriate description of soft to hard transitions in the context of billiards .",
    "usually the hard walls are modelled by @xmath0-functions which allow for a simple description of the collision processes , since variables ( angle and velocity ) before and after the collisions with the walls can be given explicitly .",
    "however , the corresponding equations of motion are not well defined . in the case of soft walls the variables before and after the collisions can not be given in general explicitly , and equations of motion must be solved numerically .",
    "thus , in order to study continuously the transition from soft to hard walls , equations of motions must be well defined in all cases .",
    "a first contribution @xcite in this direction analyzed the dynamics of two interacting particles inside a 1d billiard with soft walls , where the soft walls were modelled by the error function , which describes continuously and correctly the mentioned transition .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to generalize these results to the case of three soft interacting particles on a ring , and analyze the correct transition to point - like collisions .",
    "a general scaled hamiltonian is derived which nicely describes this transition and also shows that the dynamics occurs inside a soft triangle billiard .",
    "the dynamics depends only on the _ masses ratio _ between particles and _ softness ratio _ of the interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . while in section  [ triangle ] the hard wall triangle billiard",
    "is revisited , section [ soft - triangle ] presents the general soft hamiltonian system for three interacting particles , our main analytical result . in section [ toda ]",
    "we apply the soft hamiltonian to the toda model with unequal masses .",

    "it is well know @xcite that the motion of three particles on a frictionless ring with point - like interactions is equivalent to one particle moving freely inside the triangular billiard with angles    @xmath1    and colliding elastically with the sides of the triangle . here",

    "the point - like collision between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 defines one side of the triangle at @xmath12 , and the collision of these particles with particle @xmath13 defines the other two sides of the same triangle . for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) we get the right triangular billiard which corresponds to the motion of two particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 moving inside the 1d box with hard walls . in this case",
    "the interaction between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the point - like collision and the fixed particle @xmath13 plays the role of a 1d hard - wall . in such systems",
    "the lyapunov exponent is zero @xcite and the whole dynamics can be monitored by changing the angles of the triangle billiard @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the yukawa interaction between particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 is enough to generate positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "it is also worth to mention it is possible @xcite to relate the linear instability inside the triangular billiard with the lyapunov exponents from quadratic irrational numbers , which are related to the angles of the triangle , and thus to the masses ratio .",
    "as observed in hamiltonian ( [ hdelta ] ) , the collisions with the fixed hard - wall can be represented by @xmath0-potentials .",
    "however , the corresponding equations of motion are not well defined .",
    "therefore , to describe analytically the transition to hard walls , we include soft interactions between particles which , in a given limit , are expected to describe the collisions with the hard - walls .",
    "let us start with the hamiltonian of the three particles on a frictionless ring given by    @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) defines the softness of each pairwise interaction .",
    "it is assumed that the interaction potential @xmath21 between the particles depends only on the relative position between them and that for @xmath22 a @xmath0-like function is obtained for the corresponding _ force _ , and _ not _ for the potential .",
