    "one of the fundamental questions of nuclear structure physics is : what are the limits of nuclear stability ?",
    "how many neutrons or protons can we add to a given nucleus before it becomes unstable against spontaneous neutron or proton emission ? if one connects the isotopes with zero neutron separation energy , @xmath2 , in the nuclear chart one obtains the neutron dripline .",
    "similarly , the proton dripline is defined by the condition @xmath3 .",
    "another limit to stability is the superheavy element region around @xmath4 and @xmath5 which is formed by a delicate balance between strong coulomb repulsion and additional binding due to closed shells .",
    "the nuclear chart shows less than 300 stable nuclear isotopes , and about 1700 additional isotopes have been synthesized and studied in accelerator experiments .",
    "nuclei in between the proton and neutron driplines are unstable against @xmath6-decay .",
    "nuclei outside the driplines decay by spontaneous neutron emission or proton radioactivity .",
    "the neutron - rich side , in particular , exhibits thousands of nuclear isotopes still to be explored ( ` terra incognita ' ) .",
    "some of these exotic nuclei can be studied with existing first - generation radioactive ion beam facilities ( e.g. hribf at oak ridge , nscl at michigan state university , ganil in france , gsi in germany , and riken in japan ) .",
    "several countries are planning to construct new ` second generation ' rib facilities , in particular for the exploration of neutron rich isotopes . in the united states ,",
    "the doe / nsf long range plan for nuclear physics , published in april 2002 , gives the highest priority for new construction to ria ( rare isotope accelerator ) .",
    "ria is a bold new concept in exotic beam facilities in that it combines both of the known rare isotope production techniques : the isol method ( thick - target spallation ) and high - energy projectile fragmentation .",
    "theories predict profound differences between the known isotopes near stability and the exotic nuclei at the driplines @xcite : for n - rich nuclei , as the fermi level approaches the particle continuum at @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch_pot ] ) weakly bound states couple strongly to the continuum states giving rise to neutron halos and neutron skins .",
    "theories also expect large pairing correlations and new collective modes ( e.g. ` pigmy resonance ' ) , a weakening of the spin - orbit force leading to a quenching of the shell gaps , and perhaps new magic numbers",
    ".         furthermore , ria will allow us to address fundamental questions in nuclear astrophysics : more than half of all elements heavier than iron are thought to be produced in supernovae explosions by the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) .",
    "the r - process path contains many exotic neutron - rich nuclei which can only be studied with ria .",
    "also , the predicted neutron skins would allow us to measure the properties of pure neutron matter which is of great interest for the study of neutron stars .",
    "these experimental developments as well as recent advances in computational physics have sparked renewed interest in nuclear structure theory .",
    "there are several types of approaches in nuclear structure theory @xcite : for the lightest nuclei , ab - initio calculations ( green s function monte carlo , no - core shell model ) based on the bare n - n interaction are possible @xcite .",
    "medium - mass nuclei up to @xmath8 may be treated in the large - scale shell model approach @xcite . for heavier nuclei",
    "one utilizes either nonrelativistic @xcite or relativistic @xcite mean field theories .",
    "an accurate treatment of the pairing interaction is essential for exotic nuclei @xcite . as we move away from the valley of stability ,",
    "surprisingly little is known about the pairing force : for example , what is its density dependence ?",
    "neutron - rich nuclei are expected to be highly superfluid due to continuum excitation of neutron ` cooper pairs ' .",
    "these large pairing correlations near the driplines can no longer be described by a small residual interaction .",
    "it becomes necessary to treat the mean field and the pairing field in a single self - consistent theory , known as the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ( hfb ) .",
    "near the neutron dripline , the fermi energy approaches @xmath7 and the outermost nucleons are weakly bound ( which implies a large spatial extent ) ; they are strongly coupled to the particle continuum at @xmath9 .",
    "these features represent major challenges for the numerical solution .",
    "most hfb calculations to date are carried out in a truncated discrete harmonic ocillator basis , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this approach is quite appropriate for nuclei in the vicinity of the stability line .",
    "however , farther from stability , the continuum states become important and coordinate - based representations have numerous advantages : for example , the well - known ` french code ' uses a truncated 3-d hartree - fock basis @xcite which consists of both localized states and discretized continuum states ; however , in this approach one can only include continuum states up to about @xmath10 mev of excitation energy .",
    "for nuclei in the vicinity of the driplines , continuum states with an equivalent single - particle energy of up to 60 mev must be taken into account .",
    "one - dimensional calculations for spherical nuclei have been carried out in coordinate space for many years @xcite , but only recently has our vanderbilt group succeeded in generalizing this approach to the important case of deformed axially symmetric nuclei ( hfb on a 2-d lattice ) @xcite .",
    "we utilize a novel computational technique , a basis - spline representation of wavefunctions and operators , which allows us to accurately describe high - energy continuum states in two space dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian in occupation number representation has the form @xmath12 the general linear transformation from particle operators @xmath13 to quasiparticle operators @xmath14 take the form @xcite : @xmath15 the hfb approximate ground state of the many - body system is defined as a vacuum with respect to quasiparticles @xmath16 the hfb ground state energy including the constraint on the particle number @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where the lagrange multiplier @xmath19 is the fermi energy of the system .",

    "note that the pairing gap is a positive quantity because @xmath55 .      for certain types of effective interactions ( e.g. skyrme mean field and pairing delta - interactions ) the particle hamiltonian @xmath56 and the pairing hamiltonian @xmath57 are diagonal in isospin space and local in position space , resulting in the following hfb equations with a 4x4 structure in spin space : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the hfb equations have a mathematical structure that is similar to the dirac equation : the spectrum of quasiparticle energies @xmath60 is unbounded from above _ and _ below .",
