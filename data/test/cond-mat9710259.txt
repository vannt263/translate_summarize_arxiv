    "we are extremely pleased to be able to add our contribution to this collection of works , by many eminent authors in a wide spectrum of fields , in honor of rolf landauer s lifetime of contributions to our understanding of the physical world .",
    "we will say a lot more about what those contributions have meant for us below , but we might note one important motivation which we have been given by rolf s many battles with the producers of conference books and special volumes such as this one ! rolf believes strongly that the written word should be taken seriously , and that contributions , seriously written , should not languish on an editor s shelf waiting for slaggart authors or testy co - editors to do their neglected duty .",
    "so we have , first and foremost , been assiduous in delivering this contribution to prof",
    ". datta by the announced deadline !    as will be evident in our technical discussion below , we are largely mathematical physicists .",
    "we would say that rolf generally takes a jaundiced view of such creatures ; for him , there is an absolute need for _ explanation _ and _ understanding _ of scientific truths in the full human sense , not in the purely formal and mathematical sense with which those of our species often content themselves .",
    "rolf has challenged us throughout our careers , from our green function studies ( as mere children ) of conductance fluctuations and aharanov - bohm effects in mesoscopic conductors , to our very recent brazen assertions about the efficacy of error correction techniques in quantum information processing  he has challenged us to explain , with as much clarity and insight as we could muster , the basic underlying reasons why the assertions that we were making were really true . and , as we feel we have come to understand better as we struggle towards our own scientific maturity , it is in the answers to these questions , posed relentlessly to everyone ( we suspect ) whose article appears in this volume , and not the successful summations of a diagram series , from which true , significant scientific progress is produced .",
    "so , we thank rolf greatly for these promptings which he has given to our own work .",
    "as one specific illustration of the remarkable flowering of scientific progress which has resulted from the landauer way of thinking , we would like to tell the story , in which one of us ( ddv ) has been a player , of the development of the theory of quantum error correction .",
    "this theoretical area , which today has many ardent practitioners ( some more about them below ) , is remarkable in that it was believed to be a strictly non - existent subject as little as two years ago ( at this writing , september 1997 ) .",
    "rolf contributed to the belief that quantum error correction could not be done@xcite , as indeed it could not in the original conceptions of quantum computing .",
    "his message seemed to be compelling quantum information is a form of analog information .",
    "in many respects this statement is entirely correct : what we mean by a qubit is a two - state quantum system which , unlike the conventional bit , can be a continuum of possible states as specified by its wavefunction : @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary complex numbers , apart from the normalization condition .",
    "( actually , the permissible state of a qubit is more general ; it can be in a mixed state described by a density operator . )",
    "the availability of this continuum of states is intrinsic to quantum computation ; it appears that any attempt to restrict the qubit to one of a discrete set of states will nullify the great potential capabilities of quantum algorithms .",
    "it would make no physical sense to do so in any case , since the unitary evolution of the quantum state under the action of a hamiltonian is naturally a continuous - time process .",
    "noting this feature in the earliest speculations about quantum computation , landauer challenged the workers in this infant community with the statement that quantum computation could not be error corrected , and thus lacked a crucial element that defines computation itself .",
    "he based these criticisms on the well known defect of classical analog computing : since all states of such a device , and of the quantum computer , are legal computational states , it is argued that there would be no way to distinguish a state to which some noise had been added .",
    "thus , there is no correction mechanism , and the computation immediately starts to drift off track .",
    "the imagery which has been used by landauer of the situation in digital computation is that of a particle moving along a track of the `` standard '' digital state , with very high potential - energy walls continually `` restandardizing '' the state as the computation proceeded ( by the movement of the ball in this potential - energy maze ) .",
    "rolf quite correctly saw no hint of restandardization in any of the quantum computer implementations which were initially discussed , and he offered up detailed criticisms of several of the schemes ; for instance@xcite , in a computation scheme proposed by benioff in which the computation advanced by the propagation of a wavepacket in a one - dimensional periodic potential , landauer pointed out that the phenomenon of one - dimensional localization made it exponentially likely that before completing , the wave packet / computation would be turned around by localization and relection .",
    "thus landauer s criticism hung as a bit of a pall over the earlier days of quantum computation , sprinkling a little rain on the otherwise cheerful and naive quantum computation parade . but landauer s criticisms had an extremely important effect ; it got a couple of very original minds like peter shor and andrew steane to _ think _ about whether restandardization _ could _ , despite appearances , be performed in quantum computation .",
    "( berthiaume _ et al._@xcite and bennett _",
    "et al._@xcite were also pursuing lines which was not too far distant from what turned out to be the correct one . )",
    "part of the discovery which shor@xcite , steane@xcite , and then many others developed was a relatively obvious one , namely that quantum states could be _",
    "encoded_. in classical information theory , coding just refers to the use of a string of bits to stand in for the value of one bit ( or perhaps a smaller block of bits ) .",
    "the idea is that the redundancy in this encoding allows errors ( at least some errors ) to be caught and repaired ; such is the standard practice in digital communications",
    ".    it should , of course , be not at all obvious how redundancy can be of any use in quantum computation .",
    "redundancy is apparently not very useful in conventional analog computation ; in addition , since quantum states can not be `` cloned '' or copied@xcite , it would seem that even the simplest kind of redundancy is not even possible in principle .",
    "what shor and steane discovered was an ingenious way to use an entirely different fundamental quantum property , _ entanglement _ , in the service of redundancy and error correction .",
    "entanglement , introduced into quantum physics by schrdinger@xcite in 1935 , is at one level a fairly prosaic mathematical feature of the wavefunction of two ( or more ) particles .",
    "it refers to the fact that the composite wavefunction may not be expressible as the product of the states of the two individual particles .",
    "for example , for two qubits one may have a state like @xmath3 this inescapable feature of the fundamental principles of quantum physics has a variety of consequences which , depending on your point of view , are deep , profound , bizarre , ridiculous , or some combination of the four .",
    "( indeed , schrodinger recognized the peculiarity of all this ; we highly recommend his brilliantly written articles@xcite from 1935 - 6 on the subject . )",
    "one simple consequence was touched on above : the state of an individual particle can not be described by a pure state @xmath4 in general ; the density operator is given by tracing the full state @xmath5 over the other part of the quantum system .",
    "it may be said that all randomness in quantum physics , as described by the probability amplitudes in the density operator , arises from entanglement .",
    "so , what shor and steane started with was the idea that the logical @xmath6 and @xmath7 of a qubit could be coded as two orthogonal entangled quantum states ; the simple example which is central to both of their analyses is the coding into the three - qubit states @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; that is , @xmath10 is coded as @xmath11 . the second , more important point has to do with the role of the entanglement of these states",
    "it is easy to see that the density operator of any one of the three qubits in the codeword is an equal mixture of @xmath12 and @xmath9 , whether the coded qubit is in the @xmath6 or @xmath7 state . as steane says it , the information about which state the coded qubit lies in is not contained in any single one of the coding qubits",
    "; it is spread out into a `` multi - particle interference , '' which is set up as a result of the entanglement of the encoded state .",
    "one would like to think that this lack of information in any one particle means that the coded qubit could be recovered after any interaction by the environment with one of the three coded qubits , since the way that a qubit gets disturbed is by a successful external measurement of its state .",
    "this turns out not to work for the three - qubit example above , but it is very definitely on the right track . in fact , this reasoning leads us to what s wrong with the three - qubit code ; it is easy to see that , while a demon making measurements on one qubit can not learn whether the coded qubit is a @xmath6 or a @xmath7 , it can easily learn whether the coded qubit is in the state @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this is so because of the simple algebraic fact that @xmath15 thus , the coding of these states involves product states rather than entangled states , and is therefore quite ineffective at hiding the state of the coded qubit from the environment which is `` measuring '' in this diagonal basis .",
    "this result suggests that a quantum code which is completely effective against single - qubit error must be able to make the information about the coded state suitably recondite in _ any _ basis ; one might presume that this will work by making the state appropriately entangled in any basis .",
    "one might also have a brief worry that there will some fundamental feature of quantum mechanics which makes the right kind of entanglement unavailable .",
    "fortunately this is not the case , and indeed there was no point in the history of the subject when this worry held sway , as shor and steane both immediately found solutions inspired by the three - qubit entangled states .",
    "their discoveries , however , involved the invention of new forms of multi - particle entangled states , in shor s case a pair of nine - bit entangled states , and in steane s case a pair of seven - bit states . just in case",
    "the reader would like to contemplate these new sorts of entangled states explicitly , we would like to write down a pair of states which were discovered some time after by laflamme _ et al._@xcite and independently by us@xcite ; they are five - qubit states , and they are the smallest states for which one - bit error correction is fully effective : @xmath16 and @xmath17 these new states turn out not only to have the important features we have mentioned for error correction , but they also all appear to exhibit a type of quantum non - locality which is of great interest in the foundations of quantum theory , and may indeed be viewed as the natural extension of the work starting with the seminal paper of einstein , podolsky and rosen , and continuing to the discovery of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger states@xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the error - correcting properties of these states is that , despite landauer s and other s expectations , the process of error correction has an essentially digital rather than analog character@xcite .",
    "we mean this in a rather straightforward operational sense : we find ( divincenzo and shor@xcite give the details for the five - qubit code ) that error detection involves the performance of a series of binary - valued quantum measurements . then these bit values provide an instruction for an error detection step , which involves a discrete rotation of a specific one of the five qubit states .",
    "it seems that we can say that the reason for this essentially digital character , despite the analog structure of the state space , is that the code states arrange that any error which the environment can cause by operating ( in any arbitrary way ) on a single qubit acts in a subspace _ orthogonal _ to the state space of the coded qubit itself .",
    "thus , the complex coefficients are , to very high accuracy , completely untouched by the error process , and all the error detection and correction steps can work in a way which is oblivious to their values .",
    "thus , landauer has turned out to be wrong on this point ; but by his challengings , he has opened up an entirely unanticipated line of investigation in the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "we will not pursue the details here of how this story has further developed , although we have told just the beginning of what has been a tremendous development in the last two years : the formal conditions have been constructed for entangled states to be effective as correctable code states@xcite , which in turn led to the discovery of a powerful group - theoretic framework which permitted the classification of essentially _ all _ interesting quantum codes of arbitrary block size@xcite ; it has been found how error correction can be implemented fault tolerantly@xcite , that is , in such a way that it is insensitive to errors that occur during the error detection operations themselves ; finally , this has in turn led to a discovery of protocols that permit fully general quantum computation to be performed in the presence of errors and decoherence@xcite .",
    "all of this has amounted to a revolution in the way we theorists think about the future prospects for quantum computation .",
    "as of this writing , we would say that rolf , while being quite impressed by these developments , and being convinced that they really make quantum computing not such a hopeless enterprise as he once had thought , takes a slightly jaundiced view of these developments .",
    "he will make sure that we do nt loose sight of the fact that this theoretical development emphatically does _ not _ solve all ( or perhaps even any ) of the problems which stand in the way of making progress in the laboratory today on the construction of a quantum computer .",
    "we expect that rolf s wry commentaries on our efforts will continue to nudge our mathematical efforts in the direction of real progress .",
    "we would like to turn now to a different aspect of quantum information and its physical embodiment , which also has its roots in the promptings of rolf landauer .",
    "early in the development of the theory of quantum computation , benioff@xcite , feynman@xcite , and deutsch@xcite suggested , by way of existence proofs , some abstract models of quantum systems whose dynamics would result in the execution of some computation .",
    "landauer criticized this work very pointedly ; he emphasized that computers are made out of physical apparatus and not out of hamiltonians . and he made the point , as we discussed above , that it does not constitute a serious model of computation if the imperfections in these apparatuses are not dealt with in the analysis  he showed how several of the abstract systems which had been proposed , if taken seriously , would exhibit very severe flaws which would preclude their being a serious physical basis for computation .",
    "so the situation sat in around 1994 , when shor revolutionized the field@xcite and raised to an altogether higher level of significance the question of whether quantum information really could be embodied physically  if a quantum computer to do factoring really could be built .",
    "we believe that the existing commentaries which had been put in the literature by rolf made the exploration of possible physical embodiments a much soberer and realistic undertaking than it would have been .",
    "models which were current at that time included the spin - polymer concept of lloyd@xcite , and the atomic force microscope `` clockwork '' computer of divincenzo@xcite .",
    "both were motivated by the landauer criterion of proposing actual physical embodiments of instruments which could manipulate quantum information , and which were thus subjectable to realistic criticisms based on the criteria of experimental physics .    however , both the lloyd and divincenzo efforts look , at the remove of three years , very naive and incomplete compared with the much more impressive recent proposals to realize quantum computation in the laboratory . one enormously impressive stream of ideas and proposals have flowed forth from the group of zoller and cirac@xcite .",
    "these workers , armed with a very deep understanding of the state of the art in atomic physics and quantum optics , and informed by the very perceptive general formulations of quantum information processing as conditional dynamics produced by artur ekert at a very important conference in 1994@xcite , have , we think , largely passed the landauer test of giving a thoroughly complete , analyzable , and testable scenario ( actually several different ones ) for quantum computation .    here",
    "would not be the place to give a long technical description of the cirac - zoller proposals .",
    "however , we would like to describe an exercise@xcite which we went through subsequent to their work , and partly motivated by it : we have tried to codify , in a comprehensive but general way , a set of sufficient criteria that any physical system should satisfy if it is to be suitable as a realization of a quantum computer .",
    "we would like to review our five criteria , discuss briefly how cirac and zoller have succeeded in meeting these criteria , and finally discuss a new proposal which we have made@xcite for implementing quantum computation in a coupled quantum dot system , discussing how we envision the criteria could be met in this arena .    here ,",
    "then , are the five essential criteria which we perceive for the physical implementation of quantum computation :    \\1 ) hilbert space control .",
    "the available quantum states must be precisely enumerated , and it must be known how to confine the state vector of the quantum system to this part of hilbert space .",
    "in addition , the hilbert space should be extendable , preferably with a simple tensor - product structure , by adding particles to the system .",
    "for example , @xmath18 spin-1/2 particles have a simple spin hilbert space of @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "\\2 ) state preparation . within this hilbert space",
    ", it must be possible to set the state vector initially to a simple fiducial starting state .",
    "a simple example of this , in the spin system , would be to set all the spins in the spin - down state .",
    "frequently this only requires being able to bring the system to sufficiently low temperature that it is in its ground state .",
    "this is more difficult in some examples than in others .",
    "\\3 ) low decoherence .",
    "this is the criterion most closely tied to the topic of the first part of this paper .",
    "the coupling to the environment ( i.e. , to all the rest of the hilbert space of the world ) should be sufficiently weak that quantum interference in the computational hilbert space is not spoiled .",
    "given our current understanding of error correction and fault tolerant quantum computation , and given fairly benign assumptions about the nature of the decoherence ( e.g. , that it acts independently on each quantum bit ) reliable computation is possible if the decoherence time exceeds the switching time by @xmath20@xcite .",
    "more clever fault - tolerant techniques@xcite may well succeed in making this rather demanding threshold number more relaxed in the future .",
    "\\4 ) controlled unitary transformations .",
    "this is the fairly obvious central requirement of quantum computing : it must be possible to subject the computational quantum system to a controlled sequence of precisely defined unitary transformations .",
    "the precision requirements are closely related to the decoherence threshold ; imprecision of unitary operations is a form of decoherence . for convenience of programming",
    ", it is very desirable that the elementary unitary transformations be implementable as discrete one- and two - qubit operations .",
    "\\5 ) state - specific quantum measurements .",
    "the readout of a quantum computation , which would consist of some ordinary bit string , is to be the result of a sequence of quantum measurements performed on the computational quantum system .",
    "it is very desirable ( although _ not _ necessary ) that these measurements be the textbook projection measurements of individual quanta .",
    "it is essential that these measurements can be made on specific , identified subsystems of the computational state ; in the simplest case , this means that it should be possible to do a projection measurement on each qubit individually .",
    "recent work in nuclear - magnetic - resonance computation has shown that certain aspects of this criterion can be relaxed@xcite : if many identical copies of the quantum computer are available , then weaker , ensemble measurements , rather than projection measurements , are adequate .",
    "it is still necessary that these ensemble measurements be subsystem - specific , though .",
    "the cirac - zoller proposal of the ion - trap quantum computer@xcite has done a beautiful job of satisfying these criteria : 1 ) the hilbert space which they employ , the low - lying electronic and spins states of the ions , and the quantized states of vibration of the ions in the trap , have been thoroughly mapped out by atomic physicists in a series of careful experiments spanning many years .",
    "extendibility is achieved by adding more atoms in a line to the trap .",
    "2 ) laser cooling techniques have enabled experimentalists to place this system in the ground state .",
    "( there are questions about how well this can be done when many ions are added to the trap . )",
    "3 ) long coherence times are well known for the internal states of the ions ( although coherence times are a bit more problematic for the vibrational states of the ions , and the recent modifications of the proposals made by cirac , zoller , and collaborators have been partly designed to circumvent this decoherence problem ) .",
    "4 ) precision spectroscopic manipulation of the ion s internal - plus - vibrational states is thoroughly demonstrated , and a complete set of quantum logic operations is known to be achievable .",
    "5 ) the availability of quantum - jump spectroscopy implies that virtually ideal , strong , quantum - specific measurements are available@xcite .",
    "it would appear from all this that the landauer plea , that quantum computing be considered at the level of real - world devices , has been completely satisfied .",
    "not quite , though : despite its plausibility , the cirac - zoller device is a great extrapolation  in scale , and in its simultaneous achievement of a variety of experimental capabilities  from any existing experiment in ion - trap physics , and some have questioned whether these extrapolations , especially to very large scale quantum computation ( c. 1000 qubits ) will really be possible .",
    "there are other technical objections having to do with the fact that the machine as envisioned does not permit parallel operations , quantum gate operations performed simultaneously on different parts of the device .",
    "this is important because , from the theoretical point of view , all the powerful results of fault - tolerant quantum computation need this parallel capability@xcite .",
    "so , despite the brilliance of the ion - trap proposal , we have remained motivated to propose other platforms , from very different areas of physics , that have the potential for satisfying the five criteria for the implementation of a quantum computer . it is often speculated that a solid - state physics approach will be the only plausible arena for the massive scale - up of quantum computation which will ultimately be desirable .",
    "this is indeed a debatable proposition : our current ability to hold and process untold millions of ordinary bits on a silicon chip in no way translates into a corresponding capability to have and hold a large number of qubits .",
    "still , it is a fact that there is a great deal of basic research , projecting forth from the fabulous successes of microelectronics , to understand the quantum properties of small solid state devices , and it is on this fact that we hang our hopes .    we have thus been encouraged to work on a proposal for a solid - state quantum computer , one based on quantum dots@xcite .",
    "we are sure that the quantum behavior of such structures will be the subject of many other articles in this volume , as the whole topic of quantum interference in mesoscopic structures is another one which sprang largely from the brain of rolf landauer .",
    "but we think that the proposal which we have made prescribes a much deeper use of the quantum properties of these structures than has had been contemplated before .",
    "our proposal has been outlined in detail elsewhere@xcite , and we will just give a summary here , but with a couple of added features which have come to light recently .",
    "we will give this outline by discussing how we envision our five criteria for the realization of quantum computation to be satisfied .",
    "for pedagogical reasons , we will visit these five items out of their order above .",
    "\\1 ) hilbert space : we propose using the real _ spin _ states of electrons confined in an array of quantum dots .",
    "gaining control over this hilbert space requires , first , that the number of excess electrons confined to each quantum dot be precisely controlled , and in particular that the electron number be _ odd _ so that the dot has an excess spin-1/2 . at this stage in development of experiments in this area ,",
    "many groups have succeeded in maintaining some electron number in a dot exactly ; fewer groups have the capability of fixing the _ absolute _ number of excess electrons , but we hope that this will be readily doable in many of the quantum dot experiments which are envisioned .",
    "we also require that the electrons populate , with reasonable probability , the lowest - lying electron orbital ; in other words , we want only spin degrees of freedom to be available , but not charge degrees of freedom",
    ". this should be achievable by a combination of strong confining potentials ( i.e. , small dots ) and low temperatures .",
    "it seems that for dots substantially below 100 nm in size , conventional cryogenics ( necessary for many other aspects of the proposal ) should be sufficient .",
    "\\2 ) state preparation : not much need be said on this point : any conventional method of preparing the set of spins in a highly spin - polarized state ( as simple , for example , as cooling the spins in a strong magnetic field ) would be satisfactory .",
    "\\5 ) strong quantum measurement : it is necessary ( unless we adopt the ensemble approach introduced in nuclear - magnetic - resonance quantum computing ) to be able to measure whether the spin of any individual dot is up or down with respect to some quantization axis .",
    "single - spin measurements in the solid state are still in the future , but such measurements have been the holy grail of quantum magnetism experiments for many years , and we feel confident that eventually such a measurement will be achieved by some means .",
    "we might highlight one suggestion which we have made@xcite for how to do this which integrates well with the technology of single - electron quantum - dot experiments .",
    "suppose a tunneling barrier could be introduced into the system whose barrier potential is spin dependent ; such barriers are well known in some areas of magnetic physics , although it has not yet been contemplated how to incorporate them into the processing used to create quantum dots .",
    "the gating of such a barrier between two quantum dots , one containing the spin state to be measured , and the other containing no excess electron , could , at some desired instant in time , make it possible for the electron to tunnel through the barrier only if it is in one of the two spin states .",
    "then , the presence or absence of the excess electron in the second dot , which can be done by well understood and perfected single - electron electrometry techniques , would serve as the desired measurement of whether the electron had been in the spin up or spin down state . if this technique turns out to be infeasible , we are confident that experimentalists will use their ingenuity to solve this problem in a much more practical way than we can ever envision .",
    "\\4 ) gate operations : this is at the heart of our quantum dot proposal ; we discuss a few recent further advances in our thinking on this in sec .",
    "we envision a variety of mechanisms for effecting one - qubit and two - qubit gate operations on the spin qubits of the quantum dots .",
    "our proposals begin with the recent development of the experimental capability to controllably couple or decouple the states of neighboring dots by externally controlling an electric potential barrier between them@xcite . in the present experiments ,",
    "this capability is used only to demonstrate that the dots can go from a regime where a single added electron enters one of the two dots ( the decoupled situation ) to a regime in which an added electron goes into a delocalized state of the two dots ( the coupled situation ) .",
    "we propose using this capability in a more subtle way : it is well known that virtual tunneling of electrons between two spin - degenerate sites leads to an effective exchange coupling between the spins of the two electrons . by turning on tunneling ( by lowering the potential barrier ) for a controlled length of time",
    ", a specific two - qubit gate operation could be achieved .",
    "the exchange interaction leads to a quantum gate of the `` swap '' type ; for a particular duration of the interaction ( or any odd multiple of the fundamental duration ) , the exchange is complete and gate is just a complete swapping or interchange of the two spin states .",
    "this does not constitute a very useful two - qubit quantum gate ; but if the interaction is left on for half of this fundamental swapping time , the resulting `` square - root of swap '' operation , in conjunction with other gates which we will discuss next , would provide an efficient basis for programming any desired quantum computation .",
    "square - root - of - swap is still not as powerful a quantum gate as is needed theoretically , because it respects rotational symmetry in spin space .",
    "thus , it leaves the total angular momentum of the spin system , and its projection on any quantization axis , unchanged .",
    "but in quantum computation it is desirable to be able to rotate the state vector from any state to any other state . for this reason ,",
    "it is very desirable to supplement the two - bit swap - type gate with other gates which break the spin - space rotational symmetry .",
    "this is very easy to do from a theoretical point of view , it just requires adding a simple family of one - qubit gates .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental implementation of such gates is surprisingly problematic , as it involves the application of magnetic fields locally to an individual spin ( and not to the surrounding ones ) .",
    "this is a daunting technical requirement , which , we readily admit , would require quite heroic experimental efforts to achieve ; we hope that there would be other ways to achieve this which we are still investigating , perhaps if it were possible to perform local electron - spin - resonance operations on the system .",
    "but for the time being , we offer a few tentative ideas for how this application of a localized magnetic field might be conceivable , with apologies for not having been able to see how to make it any simpler .",
    "since , in the measurement scheme which we have proposed above , we have suggested the incorporation of magnetic materials into the system ( to make the spin - dependent tunneling barrier ) , we could envision using such materials to accomplish the one - bit gates .",
    "for example , if a piece of such a magnetized material were placed near the quantum dot , such that by lowering a gate potential , the electron could be made to , at some desired time , partially penetrate the magnetized barrier , the electron spin would precess around this internal magnetization and the one - bit operation could be achieved .",
    "a magnetized dot which the spin state could be swapped into and out of could have the same effect .",
    "if magnetic materials were undesirable , one could envision various local coil arrangements or magnetized probe tips which could also give the desired one - bit operations .",
    "hopefully , more ingenuity will lead to more elegant solutions to this problem .",
    "\\3 ) coherence times : consideration of this criterion for quantum computation also leads us into speculative territory , but one which we are reasonably hopeful about . in the usual mesoscopic experimental regimes",
    ", it was rare to find decoherence times even as long as one nanosecond ; in mesoscopics , however , it was always the decoherence of a _",
    "degree of freedom which was being studied .",
    "there is every reason to believe , from a theoretical point of view , that the coherence of electron _ spin _ states should , under favorable circumstances , be much longer .",
    "generally speaking , the coupling of the environment to spin is weaker than to charge .",
    "there is as yet very little experimental indication of how long these spin coherence times could be .",
    "et al._@xcite have observed free induction decay for a population of photoexcited electron spins in a quantum well .",
    "the @xmath21 measured in this decay , which is a lower limit on the decoherence time for the spins , was seen to be several nanoseconds .",
    "we may in addition consider the decoherence time for the spins of itinerant electrons in a 2d quantum well to be a lower limit on the time for electrons in a similar material but confined to a zero - dimensional structure .",
    "for these reasons , we believe that the kikkawa observations should be just considered a very early starting point in the search for long spin coherences , and that increases in these times of many orders of magnitude would not be out of the question .",
    "it would indeed be extremely desirable to find a system with a decoherence time of , say @xmath22 sec .",
    ", since the speed of the desired gate operations would be scaled to this time ; in any foreseeable experiment it would be very interesting to make the gate times a few orders of magnitude faster than the decoherence time .",
    "this would mean gate operations going at a mhz rate , which would we think be a fairly comfortable regime for ac manipulations of low temperature electronic systems .",
    "we hope very much to engage in a dialog , in the landauer style , with experimentalists and other interested parties to improve this quantum dot proposal through critical discussion .",
    "we are certain that the solutions which we have proposed for satisfying the criteria of quantum computation are not optimal , and perhaps on further examination they will prove to be laughable ; but we can not see any `` show stoppers '' at this point , and we remain optimistic that solid state quantum computation will indeed be possible and will indeed be a very exciting line for fundamental experiments in quantum physics .",
    "to obtain a more quantitative understanding of the origin of the exchange coupling occurring in the effective two - spin heisenberg model and to determine its magnetic and electric field dependence , we have begun recently@xcite to investigate coupled quantum dots from a more microscopic viewpoint . in the following we wish to report on these preliminary findings .",
    "our investigations have been motivated by recent advances in the physics of semiconductor quantum dots that were fabricated in a 2deg gaas system by tarucha et al .",
    "@xcite these experimentalists have demonstrated that such dots are well - described by a parabolic confinement potential ( of energy @xmath23mev ) and that one can fill in one electron after the other ( starting with an empty dot ) in a controlled way .",
    "armed with this information it is now reasonable to expect that it should be within experimental reach ( as envisioned in point ( 4 ) of sec .",
    "iii ) to couple two such dots ( containing only a few electrons ) via a tunable or non - tunable barrier ( as has already been achieved in bigger dots @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of such a system can then be described by adopting the lines of reasoning used in molecular theory . to put it in other words , in the same way as one can consider an isolated quantum dot as an artificial atom that obeys e.g. analogs of hund s rule when electrons are added to the shells",
    ", one can now consider the problem of coupled quantum dots as the problem of artificial molecules , or more generally as the problem of  quantum dot chemistry . \"",
    "like in ordinary chemistry , we can use techniques such as the heitler - london method or more refined approaches such as the hund - mullikan ansatz , hybridization etc . to obtain the low - lying energies .",
    "one of the main differences between ordinary atoms and quantum dots is that the attractive forces between nuclei and electrons are now replaced by the parabolic confining potential that can be controlled externally by changing the gate voltage .",
    "the associated bohr radius @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the effective electron mass ) is typically in the range of tens of nanometers and thus much larger than in real atoms .",
    "one important consequence of this is that ( coupled ) quantum dots are much more sensitive to external magnetic and electric fields .",
    "as we will see below it is this field sensitivity which allows one to tune the exchange  constant \" to zero as a function of uniformly applied external fields , the strengths of which are easily accessible in standard set - ups .    to be specific",
    "let us consider the simplest case , namely two circular quantum dots of radius @xmath26 lying in the same plane and whose centers are separated by 2@xmath26 .",
    "each dot contains one electron of spin 1/2 which interact via the ( possibly screened ) coulomb interaction .",
    "it is then straightforward to write down an explicit hamiltonian that captures the physics just described and that will allow us to perform some more concrete evaluations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 + g\\mu_b { \\bf s}_i\\cdot{\\bf b}/\\hbar \\,\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "v_{ij}&=&{e^2\\over{|{\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j|}}\\,e^{-\\mu    @xmath29 describes the effect of the constant magnetic field @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is some electric field applied along the @xmath32-axis connecting the dots .",
    "these dots are located at * a*@xmath33 .",
    "the coupling of the dots is described in terms of an @xmath34-potential with @xmath35 given by the parabolic confining energy of a single isolated dot .",
    "the change of barrier height between the dots can then be described by changing the interdot distance @xmath36 .",
    "the last term in @xmath37 is the zeeman term .",
    "the coulomb interaction is described by @xmath38 with @xmath39 being some effective screening parameter .",
    "the motion of the electrons is assumed to be planar , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "this hamiltonian can not be solved exactly but we can make progress with the help of variational ( or numerical ) techniques to find for instance the exchange constant given by the difference between singlet and triplet energies .",
    "in particular , in the heitler - london approximation and making use of the darwin - fock solution for the isolated dots we find ( omitting all details of the calculation @xcite ) , @xmath41\\,\\ , , \\label{exchange}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the ratio of coulomb energy to confinement energy , and @xmath43 the zeroth - order bessel function . for @xmath44 mev @xcite we have @xmath45 nm and thus @xmath46 .",
    "further , the parameter @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the larmor frequency , describes the effect of the orbital diamagnetism , it becomes appreciable in the tesla range since @xmath49 ( b / t ) .",
    "the dimensionless distance between the dots is given by @xmath50 .",
    "for the moment we have set @xmath51 and assumed a bare coulomb interaction ( which is a reasonable assumption for the two  electron system ) .",
    "note that the energy scale of the exchange coupling is given by the confinement energy @xmath52 .    a plot of @xmath53 versus magnetic field is given in fig .",
    "1 ( for @xmath54 ) .",
    "the most interesting feature of the heitler - london result is the fact that due to the influence of the orbital diamagnetism the exchange @xmath55 passes through zero ( at a field value of about 1 t ) and thus changes from antiferromagnetic ( @xmath56 ) to ferromagnetic ( @xmath57 ) coupling .",
    "this suggests again a novel mechanism with which one can tune the exchange coupling j to zero . of course ,",
    "@xmath55 can also be tuned to zero asymptotically .",
    "we stress that the magnetic field is not local but extends uniformly over the two dots , and such a uniform field can be easily accounted for in the xor operation .",
    "finally we note that for vanishing b - field and for c values with @xmath58 ( which is in the range of experimental interest ) j is positive for all distances @xmath59 ( i.e. the singlet state is lower in energy than the triplet state ) , as it must of course be the case for a two - electron system on general grounds .",
    "the heitler - london approximation for @xmath55 breaks down ( i.e. @xmath55 becomes negative even for @xmath60 ) for certain @xmath59 s when @xmath61 exceeds 2.8 .",
    "next , adding an electric field @xmath62 will lead to a simple shift of @xmath55 , @xmath63 this expression is valid for not too large electric fields with @xmath64 not exceeding one .",
    "thus , within the heitler - london approximation we find that such a field ( or biasing voltage ) can then be used to also tune the exchange constant .",
    "both of these tuning mechanisms could be used alternatively to or in conjunction with a gate between the dots by which one can tune the barrier height by varying the gate voltage ( in our model , this tuning mechanism can be accounted for by varying the dot distance @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is interesting to examine the magnetization @xmath65 ( along the @xmath66-axis ) of the coupled dots , as this quantity can give independent information about intrinsic parameters such as the exchange coupling but also about the interplay between orbital diamagnetism and spin paramagnetism .",
    "this quantity can also be calculated in the heitler - london approximation@xcite .",
    "however , we shall not write down the lengthy expression here and content ourselves with a plot of the magnetization versus b - field , see fig",
    ". 2 , where we stay in the low temperature regime of ref.@xcite with @xmath67 k@xmath68 t , which corresponds to an electron temperature of t@xmath69mk .",
    "the striking feature to be noted here is the initial diamagnetic response ( with the spins being antiparallel ) followed by a sudden jump at about 1 tesla . indeed",
    ", this jump can be traced back to the change of sign in the exchange constant .",
    "after the jump , the response becomes diamagnetic again ( with the spins being now parallel ) and finally approaches saturation asymptotically .",
    "thus the heitler - london approximation suggests that the sudden switch around 1 tesla allows one to get direct information about the exchange constant from the magnetization .",
    "it does not need to be stressed of course that it will be rather difficult to measure the magnetization of only two electrons , as the magnetization is only of the order of a few bohr magnetons . still , in a first set of experiments one can again envision ( as in @xcite ) a scaling up to many independent systems of two coupled quantum dots .",
    "also , the present status of cantilever technology is capable of measuring magnetic moments on the order of a single bohr magneton ! it would be interesting to explore the possibility whether one could use magnetic force microscopes etc . to measure such magnetization effects .",
    "the above analysis can ( and should ! ) be refined by making use of the hund - mullikan ( or lcao ) method and by including sp - type of hybridization effects ( which however are balanced by orbital field effects ) .",
    "these calculations become rather involved @xcite , and we will report on them elsewhere . in principle , it is possible to solve this problem to arbitrary accuracy by making use of powerful numerical techniques developed in molecular physics .",
    "[ it is amusing to mention parenthetically that in these numerics one approximates the atomic wave functions by gaussians mainly for technical reasons ; here in our case of quantum dots with parabolic confinement this would in fact be exact and a much better convergence can be expected . ]",
    "it is worth mentioning that spin - orbit effects can essentially be neglected in the case of only very few electrons per dot .",
    "indeed , the spin - orbit interaction in a quantum dot with parabolic confinement takes the form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the angular momentum of the confined electron which is of the order of @xmath72 .",
    "thus we can estimate that @xmath73 for above values and with an effective electron mass found in gaas .",
    "it is clear by now that the above analysis can be extended to situations with more than one electron per dot , although the complexity of the problem increases rapidly .",
    "we hope to report soon on our progress in this direction .    finally , it is a most rewarding aspect of this area of research , which we have the privilege to bring to rolf landauer s attention , that even apart from our ultimate goal of building a working quantum computer there is plenty of fascinating and novel physics to be discovered on our way that will keep us ( and hopefully our experimental colleagues ! ) quite busy for a while .",
