    "investigation of astrophysical origins of the elements is a important task of modern astrophysics .",
    "the elements more heavier than iron - group elements are mainly produced by slow neutron - capture process ( s - process ) and rapid neutron - capture process ( r - process ) @xcite .",
    "the s - process contains two categories : the weak s - process and the main s - process .",
    "the weak s - process mainly produces the lighter neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , sr ) and occurs in massive stars @xcite .",
    "the contribution of s - process to the heavier neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , ba ) is due to the main s - process .",
    "the low - mass and intermediate - mass agb stars are usually considered to be the sites in which the main s - process occur @xcite . by subtracting the s - process abundances from the solar system abundances , @xcite derived the r - process abundances , which are called as  residual r - process abundances \" .",
    "there are many evidences supporting that sne ii are the sites of the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite . because of the large overabundance of r - process element eu ( [ eu / fe]@xmath0 ) , the two  main r - process stars \" cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 arouse special attention : their abundance patterns of the heavier neutron - capture elements fitted the r - process pattern of solar system very closely @xcite . however , their lighter neutron - capture elements ( i.e. , from rb to ag ) are too defficient to agree with the  residual r - process abundances \" @xcite .",
    "this implies that , for explaining the r - process abundances of the solar system , another process , referred to as the  lighter element primary process \" @xcite or  weak r - process \" @xcite , is required .    by comparison ,",
    "the abundance patterns of weak r - process stars , hd 122563 and hd 88609 , show excess of lighter neutron - capture elements and defficiency of heavier neutron - capture elements , which are obviously different from the patterns of the main r - process stars @xcite . based on the abundance analyze of metal - poor stars",
    ", @xcite found that the weak r - process abundance pattern is uniform and unique .",
    "@xcite have performed the r - process calculations .",
    "they found that the main r - process abundances can only be matched under the conditions of high neutron densities ( @xmath1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their calculations indicate that smaller neutron number densities ( @xmath2 ) could reproduce the weak r - process abundances .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the abundances of neutron - capture elements in all metal - poor stars , including main r - process stars and weak r - process stars , contain the contributions of two r - processes .",
    "the element germanium is in the transition between the iron group elements and neutron - capture elements . to date , the quantitative contributions of germanium ( ge , @xmath3 ) from various astrophysical scenarios are rarely known in the studied metal - poor stars .",
    "traditionally , ge ( @xmath4 ) has been considered as one of the lightest neutron - capture elements @xcite .",
    "it is thought to be produced through the s - process and r - process . based on chemical evolution calculations",
    ", @xcite reported that about 12% of ge abundance in the solar system is produced in the agb stars . on the other hand ,",
    "about 43% of the ge abundance has been produced by the weak s - process via neutron captures through the @xmath5 reaction in massive stars @xcite and around 45% of the ge abundance belong to  residual r - process abundance \" @xcite .",
    "note that the r - process abundances in solar system are derived through subtracting the s - process abundances from total abundances of solar system @xcite .",
    "adopting updated neutron - capture cross sections , @xcite presented new weak s - process calculations for a massive star with 25 m@xmath6 at solar metallicity .",
    "they found that ge is one of the most abundant s - elements in the he core and the c shell of the massive star and speculated that the weak s - process is responsible for about 80% of ge abundance in the solar system .",
    "however , they point out that their calculated results can not be regarded as the weak s - component of the solar system , because the results come from only one stellar model .",
    "they suggested that , for deriving the weak s - component , the contributions from massive stars with various masses must be considered . in this case , the averaged yields weighted by the initial mass function ( imf ) should be more effective than the yields of individual massive star ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , based on the observed [ ge / fe ] ratios of the metal - poor stars , they estimated that the contribution from the primary - like yields produced in massive stars to the solar germanium is about 5%-8% .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that large variations in weak s - process yields could occur since the rotating of the metal - poor massive stars .",
    "based on the abundance analysis of neutron - capture elements for metal - poor stars , @xcite found that the abundances of the third r - process peak elements correlated with the abundances of the r - process element eu , implying a common origin or site for r - process nucleosynthesis of heavier ( z @xmath7 56 ) elements . on the other hand , the ge abundances correlated with the fe abundances well .",
    "they estimated that the observed relation is [ ge / h]@xmath8 [ fe / h]@xmath9 , which is lower than the ratio of the solar system about 0.8 dex .",
    "the abundance relation between ge and fe would mean that an explosive process or charged - particle process , rather than neutron - capture process , would be responsible for the production of ge at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the abundances of the metal - poor star hd 108317 and found that the abundances can not be matched by the s - process pattern or by the scaled ",

    "point out that the observed ge abundance in metal - poor stars should serve as the key conditions in constraining the r - process nucleosynthesis . obviously , understanding of the astrophysical origins of ge abundance in our galaxy is a challenging task @xcite .    in this paper , based on the abundance approach for metal - poor stars presented by @xcite , we calculate the relative contributions from the individual neutron - capture process to the abundances of metal - poor stars in which ge abundances have been observed . in section 2 ,",
    "we extract abundance clues of the weak r - process and main r - process for ge from weak r - process star hd 122563 and main r - process star cs 31082 - 001 . in section 3 ,",

    "we wish to compare the observed ge abundances of the metal - poor stars which are formed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) with the yields of the massive stars to investigate the astrophysical origin of ge . in this case",
    ", the averaged yields weighted by imf should be more effective than the yields of individual massive star .",
    "the solid lines in figure 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the averaged yields of massive star with a mass range from 10 m@xmath6 to 100 m@xmath6 for zero metallicity ( standard mixing of 0.1 , explosion energy of 5.0 ( @xmath16ergs ) ) presented by @xcite , which have been weighted by the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and scaled to the fe abundances of the weak r - process star hd 122563 and main r - process star cs 31082 - 001 , respectively .",

    "note that the ratio of [ ge / fe]=-0.9 listed in table 1 corresponds to that the scaled ge abundance is lower than the observed ge abundance about 1.0 dex . because the observed ratios of [ ge / fe ] in the metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath19 ) lies in the range of @xmath20 @xcite , for the other metal - poor stars , the scaled ge abundances produced in the massive stars are lower than the observed ge abundances about 0.7 dex at least .",
    "the compared results mean that the ge abundances in the metal - poor stars would not be produced as the primary - like yields in the massive stars . obviously , another process , which is responsible for the ge abundances in the metal - poor stars , is needed .",
    "because hd 122563 is a weak r - process star and cs 31082 - 001 is a main r - process star , their ge abundances , similar to the abundances of other neutron - capture elements , should mainly come from the r - process .    [",

    "several previous studies on the abundances of the neutron - capture elements have indicated that the observed abundances of the heavy elements can not be matched by only one neutron - capture process @xcite .",
    "based on the analysis of the observed ratios [ ge / fe ] in the metal - poor stars , @xcite estimated that the contribution from the primary - like yields of the massive stars to the solar ge abundance is about 5%@xmath218% . @xcite",
    "have found that the contributions from the weak s - process to the abundances of metal - poor stars could be negligible , since the secondary - like nature of major neutron source @xmath22 .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the impact of the initial rotation rate on the production of several elements in the massive stars and reported that rotating models can produce significant amounts of elements up to ba , even though in low - metallicity environments .",
    "however , they found that the yields of light neutron - capture elements have the secondary - like nature , which is different with the primary nature for the r - process .    for exploring the astrophysical origin of elements ge , we will compare the observed abundances with the abundances contributed from neutron - capture processes . in this case",
    ", the abundance of neutron - capture element can be calculated as :    @xmath23}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the abundances of the ith element produced by the main r - process , weak r - process , main s - process and weak s - process respectively , which have been normalized to corresponding abundances of the solar system .",
    "the component coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the relative contributions from the main r - process , the weak - r process , the main s - process , the weak s -process , respectively . equation ( 5 ) has been used by @xcite to study the stellar abundances of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "the adopted metallicity - dependent abundance @xmath26 in equation ( 5 ) is taken from the main s - process abundance given by @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) and @xcite ( see their table b6 ) .",
    "the abundances of the weak s - process are taken from @xcite for the metal - rich stars . obviously , there are some differences in the abundance patterns of the weak s - process between the metal - poor stars and the metal - rich stars . for the metal - poor stars ,",
    "the abundances of the weak s - process are taken from @xcite ( model b4 , @xmath32 ) , since the calculated results show that the abundance ratio [ ge / zr]@xmath33 , which is close to the average observed ratio of [ ge / zr]@xmath34 .    using equation ( 5 ) and the observed data of the sample stars @xcite , we can obtain the best - fit @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 by looking for the minimum @xmath35 . in this step ,",
    "the observed ge abundances have not been included , because ge should not be a `` pure '' neutron - capture element .",
    "there should have another astrophysical origin to ge , except for neutron - capture process , for higher metallicity stars and the solar system .",
    "the component coefficients and @xmath35 are listed in table 4 . from table 4",
    "we find that , for the ge - deficient stars(i.e .",
    ", the most metal - poor stars from the sample stars - see also table 3 ) , the weak s - process component coefficients are smaller than 0.01 and the main s - process component coefficients are smaller than 0.02 , which are smaller than those of the r - processes about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the calculated results imply that the contributions of the s - process to the abundances of the ge - deficient stars are much smaller than those of the r - process , which is consistent with the suggestion that the neutron - capture elements of the ge - deficient stars mainly come from the r - process .",
    "these results can be naturally explained by the shorter lifetimes of massive stars : massive stars in the early times of the galaxy evolve quickly , ending as sne ii producing r - process elements . on the other hand , for the ge - enhanced stars ( the last 5 sample stars in table 4 ) , the two s - component coefficients",
    "are larger than those of the ge - deficient stars , which means that the contributions of the s - process to the abundances of these stars become important .",
    "based on the calculations of galactic chemical evolution , @xcite have found that the main s - process contributions are significant starting from [ fe / h]@xmath36 , since the longer lifetimes of low- and intermediate - mass agb stars . on the other hand , for the weak s - process , little contribution is expected in halo stars , because of the strong decrease in its efficiency with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "our calculated results are consistent with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "based on the the discussions above , the ge abundances in ge - enhanced stars would reflect the sum of contributions of the r - process , s - process and the additional astrophysical process .",
    "although the observed ge abundances have not been included in the fitted process , it was possible to calculate the sum of ge abundances of the four components ( i.e. , neutron - capture process ) using the component coefficients and equation ( 5 ) . to investigate whether the contributions of the neutron - capture process can not interpret the observed ge abundances of the ge - enhanced stars , we subtract the sum of ge abundances of the neutron - capture processes from the observed ge abundances .",
    "in this case , we define @xmath37 as : @xmath37 = @xmath38 .",

    ", we can find that the increased trend should be attributed to the contributions of the weak s - process , main s - process and the additional secondary process ( i.e. , the yields increase with increasing initial metallicity ) .",
    "this secondary process , which contributed ge to ism only for higher metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath41 - 1.6 ) , is responsible for the ge  residual abundance \" in the solar system and some higher metallicity stars .",
    "note that the contribution of the weak r - process to ge abundances in metal - poor stars could not be replaced by those of the  residual process \" , since the yields of the  residual process \" possess the secondary nature .",
    "from table 1 we can see that the contributed percentage of geresidual abundance \" to the solar system is about 41% , which is larger than the corresponding  individual \" values of main s- , weak r- , main r - process .",
    "considering the fitted results for metal - poor stars , we find that ge  residual abundance \" should appear with higher metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath42 .",

    "it is noteworthy that the r - process abundances in the solar system are derived through subtracting the s - process abundances from total abundances of solar system @xcite .",
    "if a heavy element ( e.g. ge ) was produced by the neutron - capture process partly , the r - process abundance in solar system should have contained the contribution of the other process ( e.g. charged - particle synthesis ) .",
    "we will investigate the astrophysical origin of geresidual abundances \" appeared at higher metalicity and in the solar system .",
    "the element germanium is in the transition between charged - particle synthesis of the iron - group elements and neutron - capture synthesis of heavier elements .",
    "the substantial fractions of the iron - group elements in the solar system ( @xmath44 for fe ) were produced in the massive stars under equilibrium or quasi - equilibrium conditions @xcite . however ,",
    "the significantly heavier elements , such as sr and zr , must have been produced by neutron - capture process .",
    "elements between these two extreme cases , such as ga and ge , may be produced by each of these mechanisms .",
    "this implies that ge  residual abundance \" in the solar system would be produced in the massive stars . to test this point , the dashed lines in figure 8(a ) and ( b ) show average yields of massive star with the zero metallicity presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively , which have been weighted by the imf and scaled to the fe abundances contributed from massive stars in the solar system . the ge  residual abundance \" in the solar system listed in table 2",

    "the ge yields related to  residual abundance \" should have secondary nature , which can be observable for stars with higher metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath42 ) .",
    "in our galaxy , nearly all chemical evolution and nucleosynthetic information is imprinted in the elemental abundances of stars with various metallicities . in this respect , main r - process stars and weak r - process stars",
    "are very significant , because their abundances are polluted by only a few processes . on the other hand , the chemical abundances of the metal - poor stars and metal - rich stars",
    "can also provide important information .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the ge abundance in the metal - poor stars could not be produced as the primary - like yields in the massive stars and should be produced by the r - process .",
    "the ge abundances of weak r - process and main r - process are derived from the observed abundances of weak r - process star and the main r - process star .",
    "we find that the observed relation of [ ge / h ] and [ eu / h ] are close to the r - process abundance ratio in the solar system and the ge abundances of metal - poor stars can be fitted by combined contributions of the weak r- and main r - processes .    \\2 . because both iron group elements and the weak r - process elements would be produced in the massive stars at low metallicity , the observed correlation of the [ ge / h ] with the [ fe / h ] could be understood .",
    "furthermore , since the ge abundances dominantly come from the weak r - process for the most ge - deficient stars , the increasing of [ eu / fe ] directly leads to the observed decline of [ ge / eu ] .",
    "\\3 . for the ge - enhanced stars , there is a increased trend in [ ge / h ] started from the line of abundance ratio of the weak r - process star at [ fe / h]@xmath48 - 1.6 to the line of [ ge / h]=[fe / h ] , which should be attributed to the contributions of the weak s - process , main s - process and the secondary process occurred in the massive stars .",
    "the contributed percentages of main r- , weak r- , main s - and weak s - processes for ge to the abundance of the solar system are about 0.32% , 3.25% , 12.02% and 43.03% respectively , which means that the contributed percentage of  residual abundance \" to the solar system is about 41% .",
    "our investigations imply that the ge  residual abundance \" would be produced as the secondary - like yields in the massive stars .",
    "our calculated results should give the constraints on models of the r - process that produced ge element in the galaxy .",
