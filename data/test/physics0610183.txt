    "the section 2[ss : phi_topo ] is devoted to the calculation of the optical phase difference arising from the topography of the object under scope .",
    "this difference depends on the incidence of the ray on the surface .",
    "when using an imaging system , this difference depends therefore on the numerical aperture of the objective lens . the expression ( [ eq : approx_normale ] ) was obtained under the assumption that the incidence angle is low enough . to assess this assumption s validity ,",
    "let us consider the contribution of each incidence in the figure s plane to the total intensity in eq.[eq : form_inter ] @xmath202 \\right ) d \\alpha\\ ] ] where @xmath203 stands for the optical phase independent from the topography . as the fringe spacing depends on the angle @xmath78 between the ray and the optic axis , the optical phase arising from the step in fig .",
    "[ fig : marche ] is obtained by weighting and summing the contributions of each rays impinging on the sample at a point of the field of view @xmath204",
    "p(\\alpha)^2 \\sin(\\alpha ) d \\alpha\\ ] ] @xmath205 is related to the numerical aperture of the objective lens @xmath206 @xmath207 and to the apodization function @xmath208 .",
    "the choice of this function has been widely discussed @xcite and let us the assume @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a parameter used to describe the apodization effect .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : form_inter ] ) turns into @xmath211 for @xmath212 ( herschel condition ) , @xmath213 where @xmath214 .",
    "if @xmath215 , one can derive the taylor expansion of ( [ eq : int_mod ] ) with respect to @xmath205 @xmath216 let us define the fringe spacing @xmath217 , as the value of @xmath218 where the intensity ( [ eq : int_mod ] ) reaches its first local maximum .",
    "as the numerical aperture increases , @xmath219 .",
    "let us thus define the gap @xmath220 computing @xmath221 , when the numerical aperture ranges from @xmath222 to @xmath223 , and @xmath210 ranges from @xmath222 to @xmath224 shows that @xmath225 so that the fringe spacing increases with the numerical aperture ( see equation ( [ eq : def_epsi ] ) ) .",
    "if the numerical aperture is less than @xmath226 , @xmath221 no longer depends significantly on @xmath210 , so that the numerical aperture value is sufficient to retrieve @xmath69 from the intensity value .",
    "the above correction of the equation ( [ eq : approx_normale ] ) is easy as long as @xmath227 is pseudo - periodic in a @xmath69 range sufficient to describe the topography .",
    "this is assessed by defining the ratio @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the @xmath230 value for which @xmath231 reaches its tenth local maximum if the numerical aperture is less than @xmath80 , @xmath232 is @xmath27 , thereby proving that @xmath231 is pseudo - periodic on the defined range .",
    "the correction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx_normale ] ) then reads @xmath233 where @xmath82 depends on the numerical aperture and the apodization function .      the figure [ fig : coef_an ] shows the value of @xmath82 as a function of both the numerical aperture and @xmath210 .",
    "if the numerical aperture is less than @xmath80 , @xmath82 no longer depends on @xmath210 , and therefore allows for a direct retrieval of the phase @xmath70 .",

    "<S> slope and height effects are then decoupled by expanding the displacement field on a functions basis , and the inverse transformation is applied to get a displacement field from a measure of the optical phase map change with a mechanical loading </S>",
