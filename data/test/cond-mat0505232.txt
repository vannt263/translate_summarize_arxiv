    "recently , a huge amount of research on complex networks has been achieved in interdisciplinary fields including mathematics , statistical physics , computer science , sociology , biology , etc .",
    "complex networks are ubiquitous in the real world , e.g. , there are technological networks such as the internet  @xcite , biological networks such as protein interaction networks  @xcite , and social networks such as scientific collaboration networks  @xcite . various models to explain the observed properties of those real networks have been introduced and studied by both numerical and analytic approaches . relatively fewer works , however , have been done about possible error or bias in collecting data and identifying real networks in a practical sense , and most works deal exclusively with either social networks or the internet  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a survey of relationships among participants has to be conducted to construct a social network , but the collected network data may be incomplete or erroneous since a survey usually targets only a partial sample of a whole population  @xcite .",
    "the topology of the internet is inferred by aggregating paths or _ traceroutes _",
    "@xcite , which also reveals only a part of the whole internet  @xcite . in biology ,",
    "protein - protein interaction networks are identified by seeking contextual or cellular functions mostly within specific functional modules  @xcite .",
    "identification of such networks by experiments also has a fundamental limit naturally .",
    "thus , all these networks identified are _ sampled _ networks from complete structures . in addition",
    ", if the size of an entire network is too large to measure some quantities such as betweenness centrality  @xcite due to time complexity , inevitably a sampling process is necessary .",
    "so far models of networks have been designed based on features observed in real networks , such as the small - world effect  @xcite and the power - law degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "but what if those _ observed _ characteristics from the _ sampled _ networks are considerably different from the original structures of the real networks ? it has been shown that the sampled networks based on the traceroute sampling method may have significantly different topological properties from the original network in some cases  @xcite .",
    "effects of missing data in social networks are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it was shown that some problems in conceiving social networks can cause incompleteness of data and lead to misestimation of quantities like mean node degree , clustering coefficient , assortativity , etc . at this point ,",
    "bias in such quantities needs to be considered in a more general sense .    in a statistical sense ,",
    "inference from a sample provides fairly reasonable estimation of a whole population if a large number of objects are selected randomly enough to be representative in the population .",
    "this naive criterion , however , can not be applied directly to sampling networks , since there are two different elements , i.e. , nodes and links in a network .",
    "a degree distribution of nodes is , for example , a statistic of a network , but the degree is not an independent characteristic of each node .",
    "nodes are literally connected to one another , by the other kind of components called links from which a degree is defined .",
    "similarly , other properties of a network also heavily depend on the way that nodes and links are interwoven",
    ". there could be several different ways of sampling networks due to the two interrelated elements ( nodes and links ) , and each method may give distinctive features with respect to such properties .",
    "there has been a large amount of work on random breakdowns or intentional attack on complex networks , considered as the exact reverse process of sampling , in the physics community  @xcite .",
    "the analytic methods in that work , therefore , can be also applied to the sampling problem . in this paper",
    ", we adopt three basic methods of sampling networks and investigate the effect of each method on measuring several well - known network quantities such as degree distribution , average path length , betweenness centrality distribution  @xcite , assortativity  @xcite , and clustering coefficient  @xcite . observed bias of such quantities",
    "is explained , and we provide appropriate criteria for choosing sampling methods to measure the quantities more accurately .",
    "some typical real networks as well as the barabsi - albert model  @xcite are sampled for this analysis .",
    "more general sampling processes used to identify real networks may consist of some combinations of methods presented here or variations of them , but we can infer by using the results from the basic methods .",
    "we introduce three kinds of sampling method called node sampling , link sampling , and snowball sampling . in node sampling ,",
    "a certain number of nodes are randomly chosen and links among them are kept . the sampling fraction in this method",
    "is defined as the ratio of the number of chosen nodes ( including isolated nodes that will be removed later ) to that of all the nodes in the original network . as in fig .",
    "[ method](a ) , isolated nodes are neglected for convenience , although they are fully predictable , so the number of nodes in a sampled network is a little bit less than that of selected nodes .",
    "we observe the dependence of the number of chosen links on that of nodes , since it is related to the average degrees and average path length of sampled networks , discussed later on .",
    "suppose the fraction of number of selected nodes is @xmath0 and that of links among them is @xmath1 .",
    "then it is found that @xmath2 if we pick nodes randomly , since the maximum number of ( undirected ) links possible for @xmath3 selected nodes are @xmath4  @xcite .    in link sampling , a certain number of links are randomly selected and nodes attached to them are kept , as in fig .  [ method](b ) . in snowball sampling",
    "@xcite , we first choose a single node and all the nodes directly linked to it are picked . then all the nodes connected to those picked in the last step are selected , and this process is continued until the desired number of nodes are sampled .",
    "the set of nodes selected in the @xmath3th step is denoted as the @xmath3th layer , in the same sense of `` radius '' for ego - centered networks in ref .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ method ] ( c ) for illustration . to control the number of nodes in the sampled network , a necessary number of nodes are randomly chosen from the last layer .",
    "similar to the cluster - growing method used to calculate the fractal dimension of percolation clusters in ref .",
    "@xcite , the snowball sampling method tends to pick hubs ( nodes with many links ) in short step due to high connectivity of them .",
    "so whether the initial node is a hub or not does not make a noticeable difference in characterizing the sampled network .        for numerical analysis of the sampled networks , we use barabsi - albert ( ba ) scale - free network as an example of model networks , which follows the power - law degree distribution @xmath5 , with @xmath6 nodes and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we also consider three real - world networks from various fields , including protein interaction network ( pin )  @xcite , the internet at the autonomous systems ( as ) level  @xcite , and e - print archive coauthorship network ( arxiv.org )  @xcite .",
    "the numbers of nodes and links for each network are in table  [ net_table ] .",
    "although results from other homogeneous networks are also discussed in sec .",
    "iv , most of networks considered in this work are undirected and scale - free networks following power - law degree distribution , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .       in this paper",
    ", we have studied the changes of well - known quantities in complex networks for randomly sampled networks .",
    "three kinds of sampling methods are applied , and three representative real - world networks , along with the ba model , are used as the original networks for numerical investigation .",
    "we have measured four typical quantities in sampled networks , which shows some characteristic patterns in changes of the quantities for each sampling method . based on properties of sampling methods , possible explanations for such changes as well as the mathematical analysis",
    "are provided .",
    "we have also analyzed other networks than the scale - free ones such as erds - rnyi random network  @xcite and the growing network without the preferential attachment  @xcite , and the results show that the form of the degree distribution is conserved for the node and link sampling in those cases , consistent with the previous work  @xcite .",
    "table  [ summary_table ] summarizes the results . to check the generality of the results",
    ", we also investigated the randomized version of each network in a similar fashion .",
    "the randomized networks were constructed by shuffling the links while conserving only the degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "we found the same results with the original networks . the results in table  [ summary_table ] , therefore , seem to hold for scale - free networks in general and provide criteria for sampling method when some specific quantity is supposed to be investigated by the sampling . from another viewpoint , bias of some quantities can be predicted if a specific sampling method used to identify a network is known .",
    "if we are interested in the assortativity of a network , for example , node or link sampling can give fairly accurate values .",
    "for a clustering coefficient , on the other hand , the link sampling method should be avoided .",
    "sampling problems should be taken into account for real network research , but not much work has been done so far .",
    "exploration of other characteristics of complex networks or using other sampling methods , rigorous analytic approaches , and establishing solid principles by more systematic investigation could all be important research topics for the future .",
    "we hope this work can make a contribution to this direction of research .",
    "we would like to thank kwang - il goh for providing useful information , and appreciate yong - yeol ahn for helping us with the link sampling formula .",
    "is grateful to kim bojeong basic science foundation and kaist for generous help .",
    "this work was supported by kosef through grant no .",

    "the traceroute command sends data packets toward a certain destination on the internet , and one collects the traversed nodes and discovered paths during the process .",
    "using such processes repeatedly , the sampled networks of the whole internet are contructed at the as or routers level ."
