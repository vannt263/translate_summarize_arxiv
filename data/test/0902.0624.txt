    "radial velocity surveys uncover large populations of exoplanets that allow models of planet formation and migration to be constrained . however , in order to study individual exoplanets",
    ", it is important to directly detect both their scattered optical flux and their thermal emission . while the spitzer space telescope has enabled exoplanetary thermal emission to be observed ( deming et al .",
    "2005 ; harrington et al . 2006 , 2007 ; knutson et al .",
    "2007 , 2009a , 2009b ) , scattered flux from only one exoplanet has been conclusively observed ( kalas et al .",
    "this is because the contrast ratio between star and exoplanet is at least an order of magnitude larger in the optical than in the infrared .",
    "thermal emission measurements allow exoplanetary temperature maps to be made ( knutson et al .",
    "2007 ) , which constrain models regarding redistribution of stellar insolation by exoplanetary winds .",
    "in addition , detection of infrared emission allows molecules such as water vapor ( tinetti et al .",
    "2007 ) and methane ( swain et al . 2008 ) to be identified in exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "atomic species can be identified in these atmospheres by transmission spectroscopy in the optical , and it can also be used to identify the presence of cloud layers ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ; vidal - madjar et al .",
    "2003 ; barman 2007 ; pont et al .",
    "2008 ; redfield et al .",
    "if the exoplanetary radius can be estimated , detection of light scattered by an exoplanet allows its geometric albedo to be determined .",
    "geometric albedo is a measure of the scattering in the atmosphere of the exoplanet , which gives information about atmospheric cloud structure .",
    "+ however , most thermal emission and transmission spectroscopy measurements of exoplanets are from transiting systems , where the orbital plane is seen edge - on .",
    "this is because thermal emission may be identified during secondary eclipse , when the exoplanet is occulted by the star , and transmission spectroscopy requires a primary eclipse by definition .",
    "transits allow baseline stellar emission ( both in the optical and infrared ) to be subtracted from the combined star / exoplanet signal , which greatly improves the signal to noise ratio for direct detection . unfortunately ,",
    "transiting systems only comprise about 10% of massive , short period exoplanets ( so - called  hot jupiters \" ) , so high signal to noise observations of the atmospheres of most known exoplanets are not accessible with these techniques . while advanced imaging instruments , such as the gemini planet imager ( macintosh et al . 2006 ; graham et al .",
    "2007b ) , have the potential to observe thermal emission from long - period exoplanets , the majority of known exoplanets orbit too closely to their host stars in order to be accessible to imaging .",
    "+ in addition to observing scattered and emitted flux from exoplanets , determining accurate exoplanetary masses is needed to characterize individual exoplanets . however , the dominant exoplanet - finding technique , radial velocity , is insensitive to stellar reflex motion in the plane of the sky",
    ". therefore , measured mass @xmath3 is only a lower limit to the true mass @xmath4 because @xmath5 .",
    "while one may infer the most probable exoplanetary mass by assuming an isotropic distribution of orbital inclination @xmath6 , an observational technique that constrains inclination is desired .",
    "+ again , transiting systems are a boon to the characterization of individual exoplanets , because the shape of the transit lightcurve is indicative of both orbital inclination and exoplanetary radius .",
    "inclination estimates from transit observations can be coupled with radial velocity data to derive accurate masses .",
    "indeed , the mass of the transiting hot jupiter hd 209458b has been measured to within five earth masses ( torres et al .",
    "2008 analysis of brown et al .",
    "2001 ; naef et al .",
    "2004 ; butler et al .",
    "the hot neptune gj 436b , with an m dwarf host , has an uncertainty of less than one earth mass ( torres et al .",
    "2008 analysis of deming et al .",
    "2007 ; gillon et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; maness et al .",
    "knowledge of accurate exoplanetary radii enables bulk exoplanetary density to be determined .",
    "for example , the relatively large mass with respect to radius of the transiting exoplanet hd 149026b indicates the presence of a large , rocky core , which bolsters support for its formation via core accretion ( sato et al . 2005 ) . in order to determine accurate exoplanetary mass for non - transiting exoplanets",
    ", however , new observational techniques are necessary .",
    "polarimetric observations have the potential to determine orbital inclination , and therefore accurate mass , for exoplanets by isolating their scattered , optical flux .",
    "indeed , polarimetry has been utilized to study dust grains in debris disks because of its sensitivity to scattered light ( meyer et al .",
    "2002 ; jensen et al . 2004",
    "; monin et al . 2006 ; perrin et al . 2006 ; graham et al . 2007a ; beckford et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the extra information content offered by polarimetry over photometry suggests that exoplanetary scattered flux can be detected even in non - transiting systems .",
    "that is , photometric detection of exoplanetary flux benefits greatly from chopping of exoplanetary flux between in - transit and out of transit observations due to the scalar nature of photometric observations .",
    "however , the vector nature of polarimetric observations may enable direct detection of exoplanetary flux even when system intensity is constant .",
    "+ polarization of exoplanets arises by scattering of incident starlight by gas molecules , aerosols , and dust grains in the atmosphere of the exoplanet ( seager et al .",
    "2000 ) . for a face - on , circular orbit ( figure [ 1figb]a )",
    ", the exoplanet is always seen at quarter phase and always has half its disk illuminated . for a featureless exoplanetary atmosphere ,",
    "the intensity of light scattered by the exoplanet is constant throughout the orbit and the degree of polarization is also constant .",
    "however , the position angle of polarization rotates through @xmath7 each orbit , because the scattering plane rotates as the exoplanet progresses in its orbit .",
    "+ in contrast , an edge - on viewing geometry generates large , periodic variability in the degree of polarization because the amount of scattered light is variable ( figure [ 1figb]b ) .",
    "however , the scattering plane is always nearly coplanar with the orbital plane , so the position angle of net polarization does not vary significantly throughout the orbit .",
    "it should be noted that the polarimetric signature of an exoplanetary transit is discussed in carciofi & magalhes ( 2005 ) and in section 4.2 .",
    "in general , an exoplanet exhibits variability in the polarization vector that is indicative of orbital inclination , and the models of seager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and stam et al .",
    "( 2004 ) demonstrate this effect . +    the simplest discussion of the modulation in system polarization due to an exoplanet exists for a lambertian phase function and a polarization dependence on scattering angle similar to rayleigh scattering .",
    "this is given by    @xmath8    here , @xmath9 is orbital phase pinned to stellar radial velocity phase ( @xmath10 represents superior conjunction of the exoplanet ) , @xmath11 is the fraction of stellar flux scattered by an exoplanet with radius @xmath12 and semimajor axis @xmath13 ( assuming a circular orbit ) , @xmath14 is its geometric albedo ( the fraction of exoplanetary scattered flux at full phase compared to that scattered by a lambertian disk ) , @xmath15 is the phase function ( the fraction of intercepted flux scattered toward the observer ) , and @xmath16 is the polarization of that scattered flux . the phase function is given in terms of the phase angle @xmath17 , which is the angle between the host star and observer as seen from the exoplanet .",
    "russell ( 1916 ) gives the lambertian phase function as the following :    @xmath18    given @xmath19 , @xmath15 can be determined .",
    "it is useful to decompose @xmath20 in terms of its normalized stokes parameters , where @xmath21 and    @xmath22    @xmath23    after shakhovskoi ( 1965 ) .",
    "the primed stokes parameters are measured in the orbital frame and @xmath24 is defined to be in the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector . converting polarization from the orbital frame to celestial coordinates requires knowledge of the longitude of the ascending node @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( figure [ 3figr ] ) :    @xmath27    @xmath28    while terrestrial planets are expected to follow @xmath29 because of their solid scattering surfaces , multiple scattering reduces the polarization of light scattered by gas giant atmospheres with high albedos ( seager et al .",
    "2000 ; stam et al . 2004",
    "; lucas et al . 2009 ) .",
    "thus , the form of polarization as a function of orbital phase from equations 1 through 4 is expected to approximate that of all exoplanets , but the amplitude of the signal will be strongly overestimated for gas giants . + from the monte carlo scattering simulations of lucas et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the polarization amplitude of a gas giant exoplanet is expected to be    @xmath30    @xmath31    equation [ eqd ] is the polarization amplitude for an edge - on orientation , while equation [ eqe ] relates to the general case where orbital inclination is unknown .",

    "2008 analysis of knutson et al .",
    "2007 ) , equation [ eqd ] shows that the amplitude of polarimetric modulation due to the exoplanet can not be larger than @xmath36 for scattered light at all wavelengths .",

    "the polish instrument ( polarimeter for inclination studies of high mass x - ray binaries / hot jupiters ) is a visible light polarimeter commissioned at the cassegrain focus of the hale 5-m telescope at palomar observatory , california .",
    "this instrument is described in wiktorowicz & matthews ( 2008 , hereafter wm08 ) .",
    "it utilizes a photoelastic modulator ( pem ) , a wollaston prism , lock - in amplifiers , and digital voltmeters to modulate and detect incident , polarized light at 100 khz .",
    "the wollaston prism feeds a pair of avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) or photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , depending on stellar intensity .",
    "the bandpass of the instrument is limited by the detectors and atmospheric transmission ; the lack of spectral filters increases throughput of the instrument and allows for high precision observations .",
    "the apd bandpass ranges from about 400 to 850 nm , while the pmt bandpass ranges from roughly 400 to 675 nm .",
    "atmospheric transmission sets the lower limit for spectral coverage for both detector types .",
    "the above components and large telescope aperture contribute to the high signal - to - noise observations with the instrument , where part per million precision is achieved on bright stars ( wm08 ) . on -",
    "source guiding is accomplished by use of a beamsplitter , which allows about @xmath46 of the flux to be sent to a ccd camera .",
    "+ the voltage output from the detectors consists of a roughly sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 100 khz and a dc offset .",
    "polarization of the input beam is proportional to the ratio of the ac amplitude ( polarized flux ) to the dc offset ( total flux ) .",
    "thus , atmospheric effects that operate on timescales longer than 10 @xmath47s are effectively removed .",
    "for example , non - birefringent cirrus clouds passing through the telescope beam will reduce both polarized and unpolarized flux equally : the ratio of ac to dc signals will remain constant . additionally , polarization imparted from such forward scattering by cloud particles will be zero .",
    "therefore , high precision , integrated light , polarimetric observations with polish are photon shot noise limited ( wm08 ) , eliminating the benefit from a similar , space - based polarimeter",
    ". + the amplitude of the 100 khz ac signal is sampled at 8 hz by the lock - in amplifiers , and the dc offset is sampled at 6 hz by the voltmeters .",
    "the fact that the sampling rates are different is not important because polarization is related to time - averaged ac and dc values .",
    "each on - source measurement consists of one , 30 second integration during which the ac amplitude and dc offset are sampled .",
    "ac and dc signals are then sky subtracted by chopping the secondary mirror to a sky field and initiating another 30 second integration .",
    "it should be noted that no less than 30 seconds elapse before the next chop throw . since sky background is low in both the ac amplitude and dc offset , asymmetric ,",
    "2:1 source / sky chops are used . that is , observing ",
    "triplets \" consist of repeated sequences of source , sky , and source integrations every 90 seconds .",
    "+ the cassegrain ring is rotated by @xmath48 roughly every 10 minutes , which causes a different linear stokes parameter to be sampled .",
    "this ensures that all @xmath49 and @xmath50 stokes parameters are sampled at least once for each star to minimize systematic effects .",
    "note that each star is observed for about one hour per night .",
    "nightly telescope polarization of @xmath51 is then subtracted .",
    "telescope polarization is the mean of the nightly measurements of the bright ( @xmath52 ) , unpolarized star hr 5854 weighted by the dc level of each measurement .",
    "dc level is proportional to the number of detected photons , and weighting by this quantity ensures that each photon is weighted equally .",
    "this is important in partly cloudy conditions , because observed stellar intensity varies throughout the night .",
    "+ the equatorial mount of the hale 5-m inhibits traditional telescope polarization measurement , which involves allowing the field to rotate and determining the center of the @xmath53 locus for weakly polarized targets .",
    "however , hough et al . ( 2006 ) and lucas et al . (",
    "2009 ) performed this analysis and report a polarization of four parts per million for hr 5854 .",
    "lucas et al . ( 2009 ) report that the polarization of this star varies by seven parts per million over one year , but this lies at the @xmath54 level of significance .",
    "therefore , i assume that this star is indeed unpolarized , and i assume that it is non - variable over this seven - night observing run . since telescope polarization is a function of wavelength , it will be different for stars with different spectral types .",
    "in addition , i quickly measure telescope polarization to the part per million level with apds on a bright , unpolarized star , even though the science targets in this work are about five magnitudes fainter and are observed with the different bandpass of the pmts .",
    "therefore , an error of order one part in @xmath55 or less in the absolute calibration of telescope polarization may be present .",
    "however , such an offset is assumed to be non - variable and below the measurement noise for the targets in this work .",
    "systematic effects have been reduced to the part - per - million level for weakly polarized sources and to less than 1% of the measured polarization for significantly polarized sources ( wm08 ) . + nightly mean and run - averaged polarizations for each target are determined by taking the mean of the polarization measurements weighted by their dc levels .",
    "uncertainty in polarization is the square root of the weighted variance of the polarizations from these measurements divided by the square root of the number of measurements .",
    "each polarization measurement is photon shot noise limited , and uncertainty in run - averaged polarization scales with the square root of stellar polarization . the polarization noise floor of the instrument is about two parts per million ( wm08 ) .",
    "i calibrate absolute polarization measured with polish against the catalog of heiles ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , since my observed position angles of net polarization are generally consistent with those in the literature for strongly polarized targets , i do not calibrate position angle .",
