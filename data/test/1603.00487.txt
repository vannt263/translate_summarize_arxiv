    "the radial velocity ( rv ) technique remains one of the most successful methods for the discovery of exoplanetary systems . at the present time",
    ", more than 500 exoplanets have been discovered using the rv technique , including a vast range of multi - planet systems and orbital configurations .",
    "the success of this method is greatly dependent upon the ability to accurately characterize the properties of the host star .",
    "in particular , the evolution of star spots , magnetic fields , and pulsations have well - studied effects on stellar radial velocity variations @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous recent cases where stellar activity has posed a significant problem in the correct interpretation of rv data @xcite .",
    "one source of activity - induced rv variations is that due to stellar activity cycles , analogous to the 11-year solar cycle .",
    "@xcite predicted such a correlation , and @xcite reported the detection of such a correlation in the solar co lines at 2.3@xmath1 m , and inferred an amplitude of 30  ms@xmath2 from the effect .",
    "@xcite argued that experience with the hundreds of sun - like stars from the california planet survey ( cps ) showed that such effects are not so strong , and that activity cycles were probably not to blame for a @xmath015  ms@xmath2 rv variation in phase with an activity cycle in hd  154345 .",
    "similar high - amplitude rv - activity correlations in individual targets have been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , for most stars such correlations are small or absent , as argued by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the star hd  99492 is an early - k dwarf in a binary orbit with hd  99491 ( also known as 83 leonis b and a , respectively ) .",
    "hd  99492 has a parallax of @xmath3  marcsec and a distance of @xmath4  pcs @xcite .",
    "the mean angular separation of the stellar components is 40.76 , leading to an average projected separation of @xmath0730  au .",
    "hd  99492 was found to harbor a 0.1  @xmath5 planet in a 17 day orbit by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit keplerian orbital solution at that time included a linear trend to account for a possible second companion in the system .",
    "the orbital elements were updated by @xcite , who claimed to have resolved the separate orbit of an outer planet with a period of @xmath05000 days .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     here we present new results for the system that reveal an activity cycle in the star and further show that stellar activity amply explains the signature of the outer planet ( c ) .",
    "section [ stellar ] provides new fundamental stellar parameters , including spectral analysis , discussion of element abundances , and activity indices from the complete dataset of 130 keck / hires spectra .",
    "section [ update ] presents our revised keplerian orbital solution , including the correlation of the outer planet signature with the activity indices .",
    "section [ photometry ] includes photometry from 5 observing seasons acquired over a span of 11 years .",
    "the photometric data confirms the absence of brightness variations in phase with the orbital period of planet b , thus confirming the radial velocity variations in hd 99492 on a 17 day cycle are due to planetary reflex motion .",
    "our limited number of brightness measurements near the predicted phase of planetary transit show no evidence for a transit but fall short of ruling them out .",
    "we provide concluding remarks in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the fundamental properties of hd  99492 have been previously determined , for example by @xcite .",
    "we used an upgraded version of the spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) package to model a keck / hires spectrum of hd  99492 .",
    "details of the sme package may be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , sme uses an iterative technique that combines model atmosphere analysis with yonsei - yale model isochrones @xcite that utilize _ hipparcos _ photometry and distances @xcite .",
    "this approach produces a self - consistent convergence with the measured surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in table  [ system ] , including values for the surface gravity @xmath6 , rotational velocity @xmath7 , atmospheric abundance [ fe / h ] , effective temperature @xmath8 and stellar isochrone solution ( mass @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 , and age ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with previous estimates of the stellar properties and demonstrate that hd  99492 is a late - g / early - k dwarf with an age similar to the sun .      the element abundances of hd  99492 have been measured only by two groups to - date , namely @xcite and @xcite . to correct for varying solar abundance normalizations , per the analysis within the hypatia catalog @xcite , each dataset was re - normalized to the @xcite scale .",
    "the [ fe / h ] measurement per both groups is 0.40 dex , since @xcite adopted the stellar parameters and iron abundance from @xcite in their analysis . from @xcite , [ o / h ] @xmath11 0.25 dex while @xcite determined [ na / h ] @xmath11 0.41 , [ si / h ] @xmath11 0.34 dex , [ ti / h ] @xmath11 0.28 dex , and [ ni / h ] @xmath11 0.38 dex .",
    "these results reveal a star that is markedly super - solar in both the volatile and refractory elements .",
    "hd  99492 has been spectroscopically monitored using the hires echelle spectrometer @xcite on the 10.0 m keck i telescope as part of the cps . for keck",
    "/ hires instrument configuration details , see @xcite .",
    "our complete hires dataset contains 130 measurements spanning over 18 years , extending the time baseline of the data reported by @xcite by over 5 years .",
    "the pipeline that extracts the rvs from the spectra ( see section  [ update ] ) also extracts ca ii h&k line - profile variations and provides an index of stellar activity @xcite .",
    "these data are calibrated to the mt .",
    "wilson s - values , defined as the ratio of the sum of the flux in the h&k line cores to the sum of the two continuum bands on either side @xcite .",
    "we include data acquired both before and after the upgrade of the hires ccd in 2004 august @xcite , taking into account the offset between pre-2004 and post-2004 calibrated datasets .",
    "the time series of s - values are shown in the left panel of figure  [ actfig ] .",
    "the periodic variation in s indicates that we have observed just over one complete cycle of stellar activity in the host star . to quantify the variation",
    ", we performed a fourier analysis of the time series , resulting in the periodogram shown in the right panel of figure  [ actfig ] .",
    "this analysis reveals a broad peak in the power spectrum that lies between 30005000 days , with maximum power occurring at @xmath03650  days .",
    "the s - value periodicity is thus consistent with the hd  99492c orbital period of @xmath12  days determined by @xcite .",
    "we elaborate further on the correlation between stellar activity and possible planetary signature in section  [ update ] .",
    "the rv measurements were extracted from the keck / hires data with the use of an iodine cell mounted at the spectrometer entrance slit as a robust source of wavelength calibration @xcite . the modeling procedure for the doppler shift of each stellar spectrum with respect to the iodine spectrum",
    "is described further in @xcite .",
    "the discovery orbital solution for the hd  99492 system by @xcite included a linear trend component .",
    "the 93 rv measurements utilized by @xcite used a two - planet orbital solution to account for the previously - noted linear trend . a two - planet fit to our expanded dataset is able to recover a similar orbital solution to that previously found by @xcite .",
    "considering the periodic stellar activity described in section  [ activity ] as a source for the previously observed linear trend and purported second planet , we performed a single - planet fit to our dataset of 130 rv measurements , both with and without a linear trend included .",
    "these fits were carried out using rvlin , a partially - linearized , least - squares fitting procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the resulting orbital parameters were estimated using the boottran bootstrapping routines described in @xcite .",
    "we included a stellar jitter noise component of 4  ms@xmath2 in quadrature with the measurement uncertainties @xcite . with our new dataset and its increased timespan",
    ", we find no evidence of a significant difference between the orbital fits that do and do not include a linear trend .",
    "we thus adopt the solution without the linear trend for which the complete orbital solution is shown in table  [ system ] and in the top panel of figure [ rvfig ] .",
    "note that the @xmath13 parameter shown in table  [ system ] is the systemic velocity of the system with respect to the zero point of the extracted rvs and thus is the systemic velocity relative to the template spectrum .",

    "hd  99491 is an evolved star and has been known to exhibit chromospheric activity for some time @xcite .",
    "it is thus quite interesting to find that the companion star , hd  99492 , exhibits similar behavior over long timescales .",
    "it is hoped that continued photometric monitoring will help to resolve the complete magentic cycle of the star , such as those found for hd  192263 @xcite , although the target is very difficult to observe due to the small angular separation of the binary components .",
    "the update to the parameters for the hd  99492 system presented here refines the stellar and planetary orbital parameters for the system .",
    "the update shows that the @xmath05000  day rv signal is due to stellar activity rather than a planet",
    ". however , there are likely other planets of smaller mass and/or larger separation that lie beneath the current noise floor . as the exploration of exoplanetary systems forges onward to ever smaller planets , the careful examination of stellar activity is becoming more relevant than ever before .",
