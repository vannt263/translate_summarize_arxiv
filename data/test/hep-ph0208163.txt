    "the discovery of neutrino oscillation in atmospheric neutrino observation in super - kamiokande @xcite and the recent accumulating evidences for solar neutrino oscillations @xcite naturally suggests neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "it is also consistent with the result of the first man - made beam long - baseline accelerator experiment k2k @xcite .",
    "given the new realm of lepton flavor mixing whose door is just opened , it is natural to seek for a program of exploring systematically the whole structure of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "most probably , the most difficult task in determining the structure of lepton mixing matrix , the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite , is determination of cp violating phase @xmath2 and a simultaneous ( or preceding ) measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "we use in this paper the standard notation for the mns matrix with @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the most recent analyses of the solar neutrino data @xcite strongly favor the large mixing angle ( lma ) mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution @xcite is certainly encouraging for any attempts to measure leptonic cp violation .",
    "since we know that @xmath0 is small , @xmath7 , due to the constraint imposed by the chooz reactor experiment @xcite and we do not know how small it is , there is two different possibilities .",
    "namely , ( a ) @xmath0 is determined prior to the experimental search for leptonic cp violation , or ( b ) not .",
    "the case ( a ) is desirable experimentally . to determine unknown quantities one by one , if possible , is the most sensible way to proceed with minimal danger of picking up fake effects .",
    "but since there is no guarantee that the case ( a ) _ is _ the case , we must prepare for the case ( b ) . even in the case ( a )",
    ", experimental determination of @xmath0 always comes with errors , and one must face with the similar problem as in the case b within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "moreover , it is known that determination of @xmath0 in low energy conventional super - beam type experiments suffers from additional intrinsic uncertainty , the one coming from unknown cp violating phase @xmath2 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for further explanation and a possible way of circumventing the problem .",
    "therefore , the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath0 are inherently coupled with one another .",
    "even more seriously , it was noticed by burguet - castell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that there exist two sets of degenerate solutions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) ( i=1 , 2 ) even if oscillation probabilities of @xmath10 and its cp conjugate , cp@xmath11 \\equiv p(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu } \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_{e})$ ] is accurately measured .",
    "they presented an approximate but transparent framework of analyzing the degeneracy problem , which we follow in this paper .",
    "it was then recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite that unknown sign of @xmath1 leads to a duplication of the ambiguity , which entails maximal four - fold degeneracy ( see below ) .",
    "it was noticed by barger _",
    ". _ @xcite that the four - fold degeneracy is further multiplied by an ambiguity due to approximate invariance of the oscillation probability under the transformation @xmath12 .",
    "a special feature of the degeneracy problem at the oscillation maximum was noted and analyzed to some detail @xcite .",
    "recently , the first discussion of the problem of parameter degeneracy in t violation measurement is given in ref .",
    ".    meanwhile , there were some technological progresses in analyzing the interplay between the genuine cp phase and the matter effects in measuring leptonic cp or t violation in neutrino oscillation , the issue much - discussed but still unsettled @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced , respectively , the `` cp and t trajectory diagrams in bi - probability space '' for pictorial representation of cp - violating and cp - conserving phase effects as well as the matter effect in neutrino oscillations .",
    "they showed that when these two types of trajectory diagrams are combined it gives a unified graphical representation of neutrino oscillations in matter @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that they provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the problem of parameter degeneracy , as partly exhibited in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to give a completely general treatment of the problem of parameter degeneracy in neutrino oscillations associated with cp and t violation measurements .",
    "we elucidate the nature of the degeneracy , and determine the region where it occurs , namely , the regions in the @xmath13-cp[@xmath13 ] ( and @xmath13-t[@xmath13 ] ) bi - probability space in which the same-@xmath1-sign and/or the mixed-@xmath1-sign degeneracies take place .",
    "while partial treatment of the parameter degeneracy has been attempted for cp measurement before @xcite such general treatment is still lacking .",
    "we believe that it is worthwhile to have such an overview of the parameter degeneracy issue to uncover ways of resolving this problem .",
    "see @xcite for recent discussions .",
    "we present the first systematic discussion of parameter degeneracy in t measurement following our previous paper in which we set up the problem @xcite .",
    "we uncover a new feature of the degeneracy in t measurement .",
    "namely , we show that for a given t trajectory diagram there always exists an another t diagram which completely degenerates with the original one and has opposite sign of @xmath1 .",
    "it means that for any given values of @xmath15 and t[@xmath15 ] there is two degenerate solutions of ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) with differing sign of @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noticed that this is true no matter how large the matter effect , quite contrary to the case of cp measurement .",
    "therefore , determination of the signs of @xmath1 is impossible in a single t measurement experiment unless one of the following conditions is met ; ( a ) one of the solutions is excluded , for example , by the chooz constraint , or ( b ) some additional information , such as energy distribution of the appearance electrons , is added .",
    "we emphasize that a complete understanding of the structure of the parameter degeneracy should be helpful for one who want to pursue solution of the ambiguity problem in an experimentally realistic setting .",
    "we , however , do not attempt to discuss the @xmath17 degeneracy",
    ". we also do not try to solve the problem of parameter degeneracy exactly though it is in principle possible by using an exact but reasonably compact expression of the oscillation probability obtained by kimura , takamura , and yokomakura @xcite .",
    "instead , we restrict ourselves into the treatment with the approximation introduced by burguet - castell _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite in which the approximate formula for the oscillation probability derived by cervera _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was employed . though not exact",
    ", it gives us much more transparent overview of the problem of parameter degeneracy .",
    "we define the `` cp ( t ) parameter ambiguity '' as the problem of having multiple solutions of ( @xmath18 ) and the sign of @xmath19 , for a given set of measured values of oscillation probabilities of @xmath20 and its cp ( t ) conjugate , cp@xmath11 \\equiv p(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu } \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_{e})$ ] ( t@xmath11 \\equiv p(\\nu_{e } \\rightarrow \\nu_{\\mu})$ ] ) .",
    "we concentrate in this paper on this channel because precise measurement is much harder in other channels , e.g. , in @xmath21 .",
    "our use of @xmath22 and its cp - conjugate is due to our primary concern on conventional super - beam type experiments @xcite .",
    "the reader should keep this difference in mind if they try to compare our equations with those in refs .",
    "@xcite in which they use @xmath23 and its cp - conjugate , a natural choice for neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the neutrino factories and the superbeam experiments are studying processes which are t - conjugates .    in this section",
    "we utilize the cp and the t trajectory diagrams introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to explain what is the problem of parameter ambiguity and to achieve qualitative understanding of the solutions without using equations . but before entering into the business we want to justify , at least partly , our setting , i.e. , prior determination of all the remaining parameters besides @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that at the time that an experiment for measuring ( @xmath18 ) is carried out all the remaining parameters in the mns matrix , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , are determined accurately .",
    "the discussion on how the experimental uncertainties affect the problem of parameter degeneracy is important , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it should be more or less true , because @xmath24 and @xmath19 will be determined quite accurately by the future long - baseline experiments @xcite up to the @xmath28 ambiguity .",
    "most notably , the expected sensitivities in the jhf - sk experiment in its phase i is @xcite @xmath29 at around @xmath30 ev@xmath31 . on the other hand , the best place for accurate determination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , assuming the lma msw solar neutrino solution , is most probably the kamland experiment ; the expected sensitivities are @xcite @xmath32 at around the lma best fit parameters .",
    "therefore , we feel that our setting , prior determination of all the mixing angles and @xmath33 s besides @xmath2 , @xmath0 and the sign of @xmath19 , is reasonable one at least in the first approximation .      in this subsection",
    "we use cp and the t trajectory diagrams @xcite to explain intuitively what is the problem of parameter degeneracy , and to achieve qualitative understanding of the solutions without using equations . in fig .  1 we display four cp trajectories in the @xmath13-cp[@xmath13 ] bi - probability space which all have intersection at @xmath15 = 1.9% and cp[@xmath15 ] = 2.6% .",
    "the four cp trajectories are drawn with four different values of @xmath0 , @xmath34 , 0.050 , 0.586 , 0.472 , and the former ( latter ) two trajectories correspond to positive ( negative ) @xmath1 .",
    "the analytic expressions of the four degenerate solutions will be derived in sec .",
    "the neutrino energy @xmath35 and the baseline length @xmath36 are taken as @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 km , respectively .",
    "the setting anticipates an application to the cern - frejus project @xcite , where the regions with parameter ambiguities are widest .",
    "the values of all the remaining mixing parameters are given in the caption of fig .  1 .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that there is a four - hold degeneracy in the determination of ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) for a given set of @xmath15 and cp[@xmath15 ] .",
    "the region between the solid lines and the region between the dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 are the regions where two - fold degeneracies exist in the solutions of ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) for positive and negative @xmath1 sectors , respectively .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) in sec .",
    "it is intuitively understandable that the region where degenerate solutions exists is the region swept over by the cp trajectories when the parameter @xmath0 is varied , while keeping other mixing parameters and the experimental conditions fixed .",
    "the shaded region is the region where the full four - hold degeneracy exists .",
    "now we turn to the t measurement . in fig .  2 we display four t trajectories in the @xmath13-t[@xmath13 ] bi - probability space which all have intersection at @xmath15 = 1.7% and t[@xmath15 ] = 2.5% .",
    "the four t trajectories are drawn with four different values of @xmath0 , @xmath39 , 0.0427 , 0.575 , 0.490 , and the former ( latter ) two trajectories correspond to positive ( negative ) @xmath1 .",
    "matter effects split the positive and negative @xmath1 trajectories , see @xcite , thus different values of @xmath40 are required for mixed sign trajectories to overlap .",
    "the remaining mixing parameters and the experimental setting are the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "a clear and interesting difference from the cp diagram manifests itself already at this level , reflecting the highly symmetric nature of the t conjugate probabilities as will be made explicit in eq .",
    "( [ tequation ] ) .",
    "namely , the two different-@xmath1-sign diagrams ( the first and the third , and the second and fourth ) completely overlap with each other . in the next section we will make it clear that the complete degeneracy originates from a symmetry . therefore , discrimination of the sign of @xmath1 is impossible in a single t - violation measurement experiment unless one of the solutions is excluded by an other experiment .",
    "we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "iii that the degeneracy is not accidental one specific to this particular case , but its existence is generic .",
    "there is always a four - hold degeneracy in t measurement .",
    "we start by presenting an analytic treatment of the problem of parameter degeneracy in t - violation measurements primarily because it is simpler and instructive . to do this we generalize the formalism developed by burguet - castell _ et al .",
    "@xcite by treating the cases of positive and negative @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "it provides basis of our treatment of the degeneracy between the same as well as across the alternating @xmath1-sign probabilities .",
    "it will become clear from the following discussions that the treatment of the mixed - sign degenerate solutions , for both cp and t measurements , can be done as a straightforward generalization of the same - sign degeneracy case by simply taking account of duplication due to the alternating sign of @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "fortunately , this degeneracy does not obscure existence or non - existence of leptonic t ( or cp ) violation .",

    "the relationship between the fractional difference in the measured quantity @xmath83 and @xmath40 is simply @xmath84 for @xmath85 .    in fig .  3 thru 5 we have plotted the differences in the allowed @xmath40 solutions divided by half the sum for the cern - frejus , jhf - sk and fnal - numi@xcite possible experiments using @xmath86 and its t - conjugate @xmath87",
    "the regions where this fractional difference is small are regions where the parameter degeneracy inherent in such measurements is only important once the experimental resolution on @xmath40 for a fixed solution is of the same size or smaller .",

    "this line can be understood as follows ; for a given small value of @xmath40 the positive and negative @xmath1 ellipses overlap and intersect at two points . as @xmath40 varies these intersection points give us this line with zero mixed sign fractional difference .",
    "the observant reader will notice that there is in a general one - to - one correspondence between the solutions with positive @xmath1 , labelled 1 and 2 , and those solutions with negative @xmath1 , labelled 3 and 4 , in eq .",

    "for the mixed sign , ( 1,3 ) , fractional difference plots there is a zero along the diagonal .",

    "in general there is a four - fold degeneracy , two allowed values of @xmath0 for both signs of @xmath1 .",
    "this is always true for the t violation measurement whereas for the cp violation measurement the four - fold degeneracy can be reduced to two - fold degeneracy if matter effects are sufficiently large , or we live close to the region @xmath139 or @xmath140 . the significance of matter effects dependence on the energy of the neutrino beam , the separation between the source and the detector as well as the density of matter between them .",
    "the fractional difference of @xmath0 between the various solutions has been calculated which can be compared with the experimental sensitivity for a given setup to determine whether or not the degeneracy issue is significant or not .    for the possible future experimental setups cern - frejius , jhk - sk and fnal - numi we have given numerical results for the channel @xmath86 and its cp and t conjugate .",
    "the cp conjugate being most relevant for these future super - beam experiments . for the cern - frejius , jhf - sk and fnal - numi experimental setups the parameter degeneracy issue is only relevant once the experimental resolution on the determination of @xmath0 is better than 15% , 10% and 5% respectively , assuming a transition probability near 1% and a @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "[ cp - cern ] - [ cp - numi ] . at larger values of @xmath27",
    "the parameter degeneracy issue becomes more important .",
