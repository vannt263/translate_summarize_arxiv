    "polymer bonded permanent magnets are used in a multitude of applications , ranging from sensors to various electric drive technology @xcite .",

    "sensing of position or rotation in electrical machines and mechanical components , the external field of the bias magnet is an important aspect for an accurate measurement @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of the bias magnet can be influenced by the topology and the magnetization direction .",
    "all these applications need a special designed magnetic field for their usage .",
    "moreover , it is often desirable to reduce the amount of material required to generate the target field in order to reduce production costs , and rare - earth elements in permanent magnets @xcite .    the generated external field of a given magnetic system can be designed with different methods .",

    "the reciprocity theorem can be employed to calculate the optimal remanent flux density of a permanent magnet system @xcite .",
    "parameter variation simulations can be used to find an optimal layout of predefined magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "however , all these methods needs a initial layout of the permanent magnetic system .",
    "compared to these optimization procedures , topology optimization allows the designer of magnetic systems to find a suitable topology of the magnets from scratch .",
    "topology optimization was initiated by mechanical and structural engineers @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it is a well established method for magnetic field problems .",
    "possible applications include optimization of write heads of hard disks @xcite , optimization of magnetostrictive sensor applications @xcite , designing of c - core actuators @xcite , and optimization of rotors of brushless dc motors @xcite .",
    "to proof the optimization results and to manufacture prototypes of the magnetic system , a single - unit production process is necessary .",
    "recently , it was shown that an end - user 3d printer can be used to print polymer bonded magnets with a complex shape @xcite .",
    "3d printing , or fused deposition modeling ( fdm ) , is an affordable technique to manufacture models , prototypes , or end products with a minimum amount of wasted material and time .",
    "the fdm technology works by heating up wire - shaped thermoplastic filaments above the softening point . a movable extruder press",

    "we consider the possibility of the topology optimization to reconstruct ( reverse engineering ) the structure of a measured magnetic field and print the result .",
    "moreover , a special structure for a given target field is presented and physically created .",
    "in this work , the density method ( also known as solid isotropic microstructure with penalization ( simp ) ) is used to solve the topology optimization problems .",
    "this method considers the density @xmath5 of the material in each element , which ranges from 0 ( void ) to 1 ( bulk ) .",
    "this leads to one of optimization variable per element .",
    "intermediate densities are penalized in this approach , which means that the density of the final design should be only 0 or 1 @xcite . for permanent magnetic systems",
