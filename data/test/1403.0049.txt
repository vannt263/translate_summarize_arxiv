    "<S> quantum squeezing in mechanical systems is not only a key signature of macroscopic quantum effects , but can also be utilized to advance the metrology of weak forces . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that strong mechanical squeezing in the steady state can be generated in an optomechanical system with mechanical nonlinearity and red - detuned monochromatic driving on the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing is achieved as the joint effect of nonlinearity - induced parametric amplification and cavity cooling , and is robust against thermal fluctuations of the mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the mechanical squeezing can be detected via an ancilla cavity mode . </S>"
