    "the dynamics of micron and nanoscale cantilevers are important to a wide variety of technologies . for example , the invention of the atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite , which relies upon the dynamics of a cantilever a few hundred microns in length , has revolutionized surface science paving the way for direct measurements of intermolecular forces and topographical mappings with atomic precision for a broad array of materials including semiconductors , polymers , carbon nanotubes , and biological cells  @xcite ( see  @xcite for current reviews ) . in conventional dynamic atomic force microscopy",
    "the cantilever is used to measure the force interactions between the cantilever tip and sample .",
    "cantilevers smaller than conventional afm have also been used to unfold single protein molecules with improved force and time resolution  @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed to exploit the inherent thermal motion of small cantilevers to make dynamic measurements of single molecules  @xcite .",
    "a passive undriven cantilever placed in a viscous fluid will exhibit stochastic oscillations caused by the thermal bombardment of fluid molecules by brownian motion .",
    "in fact , measuring the thermal spectra of the cantilever is a commonly used afm calibration technique  @xcite .    in all of these applications",
    "the ultimate force sensitivity of a particular measurement is limited by the inherent thermal noise of the experimental system .",
    "there are at least two ways to improve upon this limitation : ( i ) make the cantilevers smaller  @xcite , ( ii ) use correlated measurements of multiple cantilevers  @xcite .    uniformly decreasing the dimensions of a cantilever results in the favorable combination of decreasing the cantilever s equivalent spring constant while increasing its resonant frequency yielding improved force sensitivity and time resolution . by measuring the cross - correlations between two cantilevers in fluid the independent fluctuations of the two",
    "do not contribute , leaving only the smaller correlated fluctuations due to coupling through the fluid .",
    "this type of approach has been used to measure femtonewton forces on millisecond time scales between two micron scale beads placed in separate optical traps ( an improvement of a hundredfold from prior measurements )  @xcite .",
    "the ability to significantly increase the force resolution by making correlated measurements has yet to be exploited for micron and nanoscale cantilevers .",
    "the magnitude of the fluid coupled noise will depend upon the spacing and exact geometries of the cantilevers . combining ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) and measuring the correlations of multiple nanoscale cantilevers offer the potential for experimental measurements with unprecedented force and time resolution  @xcite .    as experimental measurement continues to push toward the stochastic limit it is important that we build a physical understanding of the stochastic dynamics of micron and nanoscale cantilevers for the precise conditions of experiment including complex cantilever geometries  @xcite , the effects of nearby walls  @xcite , and the fluid - coupled dynamics of multiple cantilevers in an array configuration  @xcite .",
    "although micron and nanoscale cantilevers exhibit stochastic motion due to the thermal motion of matter the elastic structures are still large compared to individual fluid molecules and the equations of continuum mechanics remain valid . in what follows we",
    "are concerned with situations where the knudsen number ( the ratio of the mean free path of the fluid particles to the width of a cantilever ) remains sufficiently small so that this statement remains true .",
    "this means that the fluid is described by the usual navier - stokes equations with no - slip and stress continuity boundary conditions at the solid surfaces .",
    "the navier - stokes equations governing the motion of an incompressible fluid , and written in nondimensional form , are @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fluid velocity , @xmath2 is the pressure , and @xmath3 is time .",

    "the strouhal number @xmath6 plays the role of a frequency based reynolds number expressing the ratio between local inertia forces and viscous forces where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are characteristic length and time scales , respectively .",
    "the velocity based reynolds number @xmath9 expresses the ratio between convective inertial forces and viscous forces .",
    "micron and nanoscale cantilevers are characterized by high oscillation frequencies and small oscillation amplitudes . in this case",
    "@xmath10 so that the nonlinear convective inertial term @xmath11 is negligible and the equations become linear .",
    "however , the strouhal number , @xmath12 ( using the half - width @xmath13 as the appropriate length scale ) is often not negligible . as a result",
    ", the local inertia term must be kept in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) making the analysis more difficult .",
    "in addition , experimentally motivated cantilevers are often of complex geometry , near surfaces , or in an array configuration with multiple cantilevers in close proximity .",
    "these difficulties have led to the development of a thermodynamic approach to calculate the stochastic dynamics of micron and submicron scale cantilevers for the precise conditions of experiment ( discussed below )  @xcite . in the following it",
    "is assumed that @xmath5 is negligible , and we leave off the subscript denoting @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "the fluid equations are coupled with the governing equations of elasticity , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stress tensor , @xmath18 is the cantilever density , and @xmath19 is the cantilever deflection .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : ns]),([eq : mass ] ) , and ( [ eq : beam ] ) represent the governing deterministic continuum equations .",
    "if one considers lengths scales on the order of a few atomic lengths these equations would include stochastic terms  @xcite .",
    "this represents a difficult fluid - solid interaction problem governing the stochastic cantilever dynamics . a brute force molecular dynamics approach which would resolve the stochastic motion of all of the fluid and solid molecules is computationally prohibitive",
    "however , the system is always near equilibrium permitting a much more accessible thermodynamic based solution strategy .",

    "the thermodynamic approach discussed here is based upon the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which states that for equilibrium systems the manner in which the system returns from a linear macroscopic perturbation is related to time correlations of equilibrium microscopic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "underlying this statement is the fact that equilibrium fluctuations and the dissipation of the system responding to a macroscopic perturbation are governed by the same physics . for the case of miniature elastic objects in a fluid",
    "the dissipation is dominated by the fluid viscosity and the fluctuations by the motion due to the bombardment by the fluid molecules . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that all of the dissipation comes from the fluid and that elastic dissipation in the cantilever is negligible .",
    "this assumption , however , is not required and other sources of dissipation could be included if desired . the essence of our approach is to calculate the dissipation _ deterministically _ and to use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to determine the cantilever s dynamics . the approach is exact and the only assumptions that have been made are classical dynamics and linear perturbations from equilibrium .",
    "the deterministic calculation of the dissipation can come from analytical theory , simplified models , or from detailed numerical simulations .",
    "the major benefit of this approach is that the deterministic calculations are straightforward , not computationally prohibitive , and methods of calculation are sophisticated and readily available .",
