    "every street cat can fall on its feet @xcite but only baron von munchausen ever claimed to have lifted himself by applying self - forces ( actually , by pulling on his hair @xcite ) .",
    "the reason why none else does is because , as we were taught in high - school physics , the motion of the center of mass can not be affected by internal forces . in particular ,",
    "if the center of mass is at rest , it can only be moved by external forces . as pointed out by j. wisdom @xcite , in a curved space this piece of high school physics",
    "is no longer true : a deformable body can apply internal forces that would result in swimming , much like a cat turning in euclidean space while maintaining zero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the reason why high school physics fails for curved space is tied to the fact that the notion of center of mass is a fundamentally a euclidean notion , with no analog in curved space , see fig .",
    "[ fig : com ] .",
    "5 cm    swimming is the motion of deformable bodies .",
    "more precisely , we shall mean by this the rigid body motion affected by a periodic deformation .",
    "after completing a swimming stroke the swimmer regains its original shape and finds itself in a different location .",
    "the new location is determined by solving the equations of motion @xcite .    in a generic curved space ,",
    "the shape of a general swimmer completely determines its location .",
    "therefore a strictly periodic deformation allows the swimmer merely to wriggle . to be able to swim anywhere and with arbitrary orientation the ambient space must be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this is the case for the euclidean space , and also for symmetric spaces such as spheres and hyperbolic spaces .",
    "as we shall see , swimming in such spaces is geometric .",
    "swimming in more general curved spaces that do not necessarily allow for rigid body motions require the replacement of shape space by a different space of controls . here",
    "we shall focus on the considerably simpler case where the ambient space allows for rigid body motions .",
    "what do we mean by swimming ?",
    "swimming is associated with the translation bit of a rigid body motion . recall that even in a euclidean space splitting the translations from the rotation for a given rigid body motion requires picking a fiducial point @xcite . if we let a turning cat pick the tip of its tail as a favorite fiducial point it may claim to be baron von munchausen since turning about its center of mass is equivalent to turning about the tip of the tail accompanied by translation .",
    "the cat is not really swimming because in euclidean space swimming is _ defined _ as the the translation of the _ center of mass_. since in a curved space there is no natural notion of a center of mass we need to specify what does one mean by swimming .",
    "we shall call swimming a motion that after the completion of a stroke , results in a rigid body motion that does not leave any point inside the swimmer fixed .",
    "rigid body motions are generated by the isometries of space .",
    "these are represented by killing vector fields which we shall denote by @xmath0 .",
    "there are @xmath1 such fields in @xmath2 dimensional maximally symmetric spaces .",
    "a natural notion of translations is associated with those killing fields that reduce to the euclidean translations at some fiducial point of the swimmer .",
    "if the swimmer is sufficiently small relative to the length scale given by the curvature , the killing fields associated with these translations will not vanish near the swimmer .",
    "this means that no point of the swimmer is stationary under the rigid motion generated by such killing fields and gives a natural notion of swimming .",
    "as we shall see , a deformable body can generate a rigid body motion associated to the killing field @xmath3 , if the two - form @xmath4 is non - zero near the swimmer .",
    "thus , for example , a cat can turn in euclidean space because the killing two forms associated to rotations do not vanish .",
    "the baron , in contrast , must be lying because the killing two forms associated to translations in euclidean space vanish identically . in a curved space",
    "any rigid body motion becomes possible because , in general , none of the killing two forms vanish identically . since the killing two - forms associated to translation are proportional to the riemann curvature swimming in a curved space is proportional to the riemann curvature .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to studying non - relativistic swimmers so that the swimming problem reduces to a problem in newtonian mechanics on a given static curved space .",
    "this is a simplified version of the problem of the motion of extended bodies in general relativity which is notoriously difficult @xcite .",
    "our two main results are eq .",
    "( [ eq : holonomy ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : holonomy - local ] ) . the first gives the swimming distance of a small swimmer performing an infinitesimal stroke generated by any pair of deformations .",
    "the second is the special case of linear deformations . in this case , the swimming distance is proportional to the riemann curvature and certain moments of the swimmer .",
    "the overall structure of the formulas is similar to the formula written by wisdom @xcite although both the setting , the details and the consequences are different .",
    "consider a body made of a collection of @xmath5 particles with mass @xmath6 located at generalized coordinates @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the ( time - dependent ) lagrangian of the system which admits a symmetry associated with the killing field @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 is invariant under the shift @xmath12 .",
    "the symmetry implies the conservation of @xmath13 indeed the symmetry of the lagrangian and the euler - lagrange equations of motions imply : @xmath14 suppose the dynamics takes place on manifold with metric @xmath15 .",
    "the ( time dependent ) lagrangian , being the difference of the non - relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy , is : @xmath16 the lagrangian is invariant under isometries of the manifold .",
    "the potential energy , being a function of the relative distances , guarantees newton third law : the force that particle @xmath17 applies on @xmath18 is directed along the geodesic separating the two and is opposite and equal to the force that @xmath18 applies on @xmath17 .",
    "-1 cm4 cm    the constant of motion @xmath19 , associated to the isometry @xmath3 , is independent of @xmath20 and is given by @xmath21 _ we shall assume throughout that the particles that make up the body are initially at rest , @xmath22 , and so @xmath23 .",
    "_    suppose now that the body , initially at rest , can control its shape by , for example , controlling @xmath20 .",
    "the rigid body part of the resulting motion is determined by the conservations laws @xmath24 it is evident that the resulting rigid body motion is geometric in the sense that the time parametrization disappeared .",
    "we want to describe the ( infinitesimal ) motion of a deformable body as a combination of an ( infinitesimal ) deformation and rigid body motion .",
    "we write the infinitesimal displacement of the n - th point mass in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are killing fields that generate rigid body motions and @xmath27 are deformation vector fields that do not .",
    "the killing fields satisfy the killing equation @xcite @xmath28 which can be interpreted as the statement that rigid body motion induces no strain .",
    "the deformation fields , in contrast , induce a non - vanishing strain @xmath29 we may then think of @xmath30 as the infinitesimal coordinates of the swimmer s control space .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : first - order ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : swimming ] ) yields @xmath31 linear relations between the infinitesimal rigid body motion @xmath32 and the infinitesimal deformations @xmath33 .",
    "these will turn out to be the swimming equations .",
    "however , to derive these we first need to put coordinates on shapes and rigid motions that will effectively replace the possibly very large number of particle coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the initial location of the swimmer , the shape @xmath35 .",
    "we may identify @xmath36 as the new location of the swimmer ( shape ) that underwent rigid body motion from the origin .",
    "more precisely , the flow @xmath37 at one unit of time gives the displaced shape .",
    "for small @xmath38 the mapping @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 we write for the displaced shape @xmath41 , symbolically , @xmath42      we now want to put coordinates on shape space .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the undeformed shape @xmath35",
    ". the deformed shape , without paying attention to its location , will be denote by @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 being the number of independent strain ( deformation ) fields at the disposal of the swimmer .",
    "more precisely , the deformed shape is covariantly defined by the solution of the flow @xmath47 after a unit time . for small @xmath48 the mapping @xmath49",
    "is given by @xmath50 we write the corresponding map of the shape , formally , @xmath51 note that this is _ not _ the physical evolution , since the latter will be accompanied by a rigid motion .",
    "the shape and location can be parameterized as by a pair @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath48 is the deformation coordinate and @xmath38 the location coordinate .",
    "since deformations do not commute with rigid motions in general , to assign a pair @xmath53 , we need to choose an order . a natural choice , which reflects the interpretation that the rigid motion is a consequence of the deformation , is to take @xmath54 to mean , the effect of this ordering actually turn out to be negligible . ]",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 takes @xmath35 to @xmath57 . by convention",
    "@xmath57 has the same location coordinate @xmath38 as the @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath58 is the rigid motion by @xmath38 to the correct physical location .",
    "a swimmer may be able to control its internal stress and thereby its internal strain , but not directly the deformation fields @xmath59 .",
    "this reflects the simple fact that there is no canonical way to integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : deformation - deff ] ) to pair a deformation field with a strain since there is ambiguity in the killing fields . to pick",
    "a unique @xmath59 one needs to impose @xmath31 gauge conditions .",
    "to do so it is convenient to introduce a notion of scalar product for extended bodies .    given a body made of a collection of point particles with masses @xmath6 at locations @xmath7 we define a scalar product of two vector fields @xmath60 by : @xmath61    we pick the gauge where each deformation field @xmath59 is orthogonal to all the killing fields : @xmath62 this gauge will play a role in obtaining simple expression for swimming .",
    "in this subsection we calculate the translation @xmath63 associated with a small loop @xmath64 near the origin of shape space . applying the deformation forces the particles making up the body to move along certain trajectories @xmath65 . at the leading order",

    "let @xmath79 denotes a killing field associated with a certain rigid body motion ( e.g. translation or rotation ) , the question whether one can or can not swim in this direction depends on purely geometric properties of the ambient space .",
    "the answer is particularly simple if we choose the killing fields to be mutually orthogonal : @xmath82 for @xmath83 . from eq .",

    "a trite calculation shows that the killing fields corresponding to translations and rotations are mutually orthogonal , @xmath94 , provided the rotations are about the center of mass .",
