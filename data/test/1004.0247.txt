    "[ fig-1 ] shows an excellent agreement between the theory and the simulations .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that to reach the mb equilibrium distribution , has required a week of cpu time , ( a million dynamical times for @xmath47 particles , see section [ core - halo ] ) . up to the crossover time @xmath3 , the system remained trapped in a quasi - stationary state , with the one particle distribution very different from the equilibrium one .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of this non - equilibrium quasi - stationary state .",
    "for systems interacting through short - range potentials , the final stationary state corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium and is exactly described by the mb distribution . in spite of a popular believe that in the thermodynamic limit for systems with long - range unscreened interactions the mean - field becomes exact , this is not quite true . or rather , this is true mathematically , but is irrelevant for real physical systems , since when @xmath2 it takes an infinite time for such a system to relax to the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "what is correct , is that in the thermodynamic limit the dynamical evolution of a system with long - range interactions is governed _ exactly _ by the collisionless boltzmann ( vlasov ) equation  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the one particle distribution function and @xmath50 is the mean force felt by a particle at position @xmath9 .",
    "the mb distribution , together with the poisson equation for the mean - field potential , is a stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "thus , if we start with this distribution it is guaranteed to be preserved by the vlasov dynamics . however , unlike for the collisional boltzmann equation , mb distribution is not a global attractor of the vlasov dynamics ",
    "an arbitrary ( non - stationary ) initial distribution will not evolve to the mb distribution .",
    "thus , the collisionless relaxation described by the vlasov equation is much more complex than the collisional relaxation governed by the boltzmann equation for systems with short - range interactions .",
    "the final stationary state of vlasov dynamics will depends explicitly on the initial particle distribution .",
    "vlasov equation has an infinite number of conserved quantities , called casimir invariants .",
    "any local functional of the distribution function is a casimir invariant of the vlasov dynamics . in particular ,",
    "if we discretize the initial distribution function into surface levels with values @xmath51 , the hypervolume @xmath52 of each level will be preserved by the vlasov flow .",
    "the evolution of the distribution function corresponds to the process of filamentation and proceeds _ ad infinitum _ from large to small length scale .",
    "thus on a fine - grain scale , the evolution never stops and the stationary state is never reached .",
    "however , in practice , there is always a limit to the maximum resolution , and only a coarse - grained distribution function is available in simulations or in experiments .",
    "it is this coarse - grained distribution which appears in practice as the stationary state of a collisionless relaxation dynamics",
    ".    numerical solution of the vlasov equation is a very difficult task . since 1960",
    "s there has been a tremendous effort to find an alternative way to predict the final stationary state without having to explicitly solve the vlasov equation  @xcite .",
    "one of the first statistical approaches was proposed by lynden - bell and has become know as the _ violent relaxation theory _ .",
    "this theory is based on the assumption that there exists an efficient phase space mixing during the dynamical evolution .",
    "this assumption is similar to the ergodicity of the boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics . for systems with short - range interactions ,",
    "ergodicity  although very difficult to prove explicitly  is almost always found to be satisfied in practice .",
    "this , however , is not the case for the efficient mixing hypothesis for systems with long - range interactions .",
    "in fact it was found that for most initial conditions , the phase space mixing is very poor . for magnetically confined plasmas , efficient mixing",
    "was found to exist only for very special initial conditions , and in general these systems relax to a stationary state very different from the one predicted by the lynden - bell theory .",
    "similarly , for 3d gravitational systems , violent relaxation theory was found to work only if the initial distribution satisfied the , so called , virial condition  @xcite .",
    "otherwise strong _ particle - density wave _ interactions broke the ergodicity and resulted in a core - halo phase separation .",
    "we first briefly review the violent relaxation theory .",
    "the basic assumption of this theory is that during the temporal evolution , the system is able to efficiently explore the whole of phase space . to obtain the stationary ( coarse - grained ) distribution @xmath53 ,",
    "the initial distribution @xmath54 is discretized into the @xmath55 levels , and the phase space is divided into macrocells of volume @xmath56 , which are in turn subdivided into @xmath57 microcells , each of volume @xmath58 , for a d - dimensional system . since vlasov dynamics is incompressible , @xmath59 ,",
