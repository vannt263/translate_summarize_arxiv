    "the first @xmath0 quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were found by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these quasars are very luminous ( @xmath9 mag ) .",
    "deep near - ir spectroscopy has shown that these quasars harbor billion - solar - mass black holes and emit near the eddington limit , suggesting the rapid growth of central black holes in the early epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the mid / far - infrared , mm / sub - mm , and radio observations of these quasars have provided rich information about dust emission and star formation in their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . therefore , @xmath10 quasars are essential to understanding black hole accretion , galaxy evolution , and the igm state in the first billion years of cosmic time .    in recent years",
    ", more than 70 quasars at @xmath0 have been discovered .",
    "the sdss pioneered quasar studies at these redshifts , followed by the canada - france high - redshift quasar survey ( cfhqs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "to date @xmath1130 quasars have been discovered in the main imaging survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the stripe 82 deep survey @xcite . the ukidss has found several quasars @xcite , including the most distant quasar known at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the cfhqs produced 20 quasars down to a fainter luminosity limit @xcite .",
    "most recently , two large surveys , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system 1 ( pan - starrs1 ) and the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) kilo - degree infrared galaxy ( viking ) survey have started to yield high - redshift quasars .",
    "pan - starrs1 is sensitive mainly to brighter quasars than sdss but over a much larger area , and @xmath1310 new quasars at @xmath0 have been published from this survey @xcite , including three quasars at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "viking data have also been used to discover three quasars at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the number of high - redshift known quasars is increasing steadily .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new method for finding @xmath0 quasars by using regions with overlapping imaging in the sdss .",
    "the sdss imaging survey was conducted in drift scan mode along great circles , and the imaging runs usually overlap with each other due to the survey geometry and strategy .",
    "this results in multiple observations of individual sources within the overlap regions .",
    "about one - quarter of the sky area covered by the sdss has multiple imaging coverage .",
    "these overlap regions allow us to select quasars that are fainter than those found in the sdss single - epoch images .",
    "they ensure that quasar candidates are free of spurious detections ( such as cosmic rays ) , which is particularly useful for objects with single - band ( @xmath3-band in this paper ) detections . here",
    "we report eight new quasars found in our first search of @xmath0 quasars in the overlap regions .",
    "these quasars are @xmath110.5 mag fainter than the quasars selected from sdss single - epoch data .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the sdss overlap regions . in section 3",
    "we introduce our quasar selection procedure and follow - up observations .",
    "we present the new quasars in section 4 , and summarize the paper in section 5 . throughout the paper sdss magnitudes",
    "are reported on the ab system instead of the asinh system @xcite , and all near - ir magnitudes are on the vega system .",
    "we use a @xmath16-dominated flat cosmology with @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "in this section we describe the sdss overlap regions , the regions that were scanned by two or more sdss imaging runs .",
    "the sdss imaging survey was carried out in drift - scan mode using a 142 mega - pixel camera @xcite .",
    "an sdss run ( strip ) consists of 6 parallel scanlines ( camera columns ) for each of five @xmath21 bands @xcite .",
    "the scanlines are @xmath22 wide with gaps of roughly the same width , so two interleaving strips make a stripe .",
    "sdss scanlines are divided into fields , and a field is the union of five @xmath21 frames covering the same region of sky .",
    "processing of individual runs includes assessments of the photometric quality @xcite .",
    "the sdss imaging runs generally overlap each other , due to the survey geometry and strategy @xcite .",
    "the imaging survey in drift - scan mode was along great circles , and had two common poles at [ r.a .",
    "= [ @xmath23 , @xmath24 and [ @xmath25 , @xmath24 . the fields overlap more substantially when they approach the survey poles ( figure 1 ) . in addition , the two interleaving strips that make any stripe slightly overlap , leading to duplicate observations in a small area . furthermore , if the quality of a run , or part of a run , did not meet the sdss standard criteria , the relevant region of this run was re - observed , yielding duplicate observations in this region . obviously , a combination of the above reasons may result in more than two observations in some regions .",
    "the upper panel in figure 1 shows the coverage of the sdss overlap regions at high galactic latitude @xmath26 .",
    "the sdss deep stripe , stripe 82 , has been excluded , because it has much deeper co - added data @xcite .",
    "the data points represent bright ( @xmath27 ) point sources with at least two observations . in the lower panel of the figure ,",
    "the coverage map is zoomed in to an area of r.a .",

    "we estimated the total area of the overlap regions in the upper panel by calculating the area occupied by the actual data points .",
    "the sources we used are point sources with @xmath33 .",
    "we divided the r.a.decl .",
    "plane into small grid elements , where each element measures @xmath34 at a side .",
    "if a grid element contains more than one object , it was assumed to be covered by the overlap regions .",
    "the total area by summing the area of all selected grid elements is 3700 square degrees .",
    "this rough estimate is accurate to roughly 10% , and could be improved by using more sources and by refining grid elements .",
    "we leave this for a future work .",
    "the total area of all sdss overlap regions , including low galactic latitude @xmath35 , is more than 4000 square degrees . for a given source in the overlap regions ,",
    "the sdss pipeline selects one detection as a ` primary ' detection from a ` primary ' run / field .",
    "additional detections are classified as ` secondary ' .",
    "the primary runs / fields are generally deeper due to better image quality in terms of seeing , sky background , atmospheric transparency , etc .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the difference between primary and secondary detections in the @xmath3 band .",

    "the upper panel of figure 2 shows photometric errors versus @xmath3-band magnitude .",
    "the shaded regions include central 68% of the sources at any magnitude .",
    "they indicate that primary detections have slightly better data quality than secondary detections .",
    "this is also suggested by the three lower panels , which show the distribution of photometric errors in three different magnitude bins .",
    "compared to primary detections , the distribution of errors for the secondary detections has a longer tail towards greater errors .",
    "therefore , a secondary detection does not always significantly improve the photometry of a source .",
    "however , it generally rules out the possibility that its primary detection is a false detection .",
    "this is particularly important for single - band detected sources , such as @xmath10 quasars .",
    "in this section we present the details of our candidate selection and spectroscopic identification of @xmath0 quasars in the sdss overlap regions .",
    "the selection procedure is similar to the procedures that were used to select sdss @xmath0 quasars in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the procedure consists of several steps as shown in the following subsections .",
    "we start with sdss data release 9 ( dr9 ) ` primary ' sources at high galactic latitude @xmath26 , by using the ` photoprimary ' table with the sdss query / casjobs online server , excluding stripe 82 .",
    "the ` photoprimary ' table includes both point and extended sources .",
    "although distant quasars are point - like objects in ground - based images , faint point - like objects could be mis - classified as extended objects ( and vice versa ) ; thus we include extended objects .",
    "we then remove sources with critical sdss processing flags such as bright , edge and satur . for each source",
    ", we searched for ` neighbors ' ( ` secondary ' detections from different runs ) within a @xmath37 radius .",
    "all matched pairs are considered to be multiple observations of the same object . from these dual observations we select @xmath4-band dropout objects using the following color cuts ,",
    "@xmath38 these selection criteria are applied to the individual observations , i.e. , each of the dual observations must meet the criteria except criterion 4 .",
    "we require that the primary detections meet criterion 4 ( at least @xmath39 detections ) , and the secondary detections should be detected at a significance of @xmath40 . in this first step ,",
    "we obtain a total of @xmath11550 @xmath4-band dropout objects .    in the previous search of luminous @xmath0 quasars with the sdss single - epoch images ( see fan et al .",
    "papers ) , the magnitude limit was roughly @xmath41 ( @xmath42 detections ) .",
    "below @xmath42 , the number of contaminants in @xmath4-dropout selection increases dramatically . from single - epoch images ,",
    "one would get tens of thousands of @xmath4-dropout candidates down to a @xmath39 threshold , where the vast majority of them are spurious objects . using duplicate observations",
    "ensures that most of the @xmath4-dropout objects we select are physical sources .",
    "we visually inspect the dropouts in the sdss @xmath21 images , and remove obvious contaminants , such as suspicious detections close to very bright stars and objects that are apparently extended .",
    "we reject about one - third of the 550 objects in this step .",
    "we then remove previously known objects , such as l / t dwarfs and @xmath0 quasars .",
    "we match our objects to the list of known l / t dwarfs from dwarfarchives.org , and find 51 known dwarfs .",
    "we also match the objects to the list of @xmath4-dropouts that have been spectroscopically identified as non - quasars during our previous searches for @xmath0 quasars .",
    "in addition , we find that 8 objects are previously discovered quasars at @xmath0 .",
    "these quasars are summarized in table 1 .",
    "they are generally brighter than @xmath41 mag . after removing these objects ,",
    "about 250 objects remain in our candidate list .",
    "we match the remaining objects to the 2mass catalog @xcite and to the catalog of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "we obtain 10 matches from the 2mass , and 53 matches from the ukidss , providing near - ir photometry for 63 objects .",
    "the majority are then rejected as quasar candidates based on their location in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 color - color diagram ( see section 3.3 ) .",

    "each spectrum in figure 4 has been scaled to match the best corresponding @xmath3-band magnitude in table 1 , thereby placed on an absolute flux scale .",
    "these quasars show a diversity of ly@xmath48  emission .",
    "for example , sdss j00080626 and sdss j0842 + 1218 have strong ly@xmath48  emission lines .",

    "they were calculated by fitting a power - law continuum @xmath64 to the spectrum of each quasar .",
    "our optical spectra only cover a short wavelength range in the rest frame ( @xmath65  ) , and this range contains several uv emission lines , so we were not able to reliably measure the slopes of the continua .",
    "we assumed that the slope is the average quasar uv continuum slope @xmath66 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the power - law continuum was then normalized to match visually identified continuum windows with little contribution from line emission .",
    "after the power - law continuum was subtracted from the spectrum , we measured the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath48  emission line , including the nv  @xmath67 ( hereafter nv ) line that is usually blended with ly@xmath48 .",

    "we ignored the weak siii  @xmath68 emission line on the red side of nv .",
    "for the quasars without prominent ly@xmath48  emission , we simply integrated flux ( instead of gaussian fitting ) above the continuum .",
    "we did not correct for the flux absorbed by the ly@xmath48  forest .",
