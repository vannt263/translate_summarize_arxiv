    "describing the quark content of nucleon structure in terms of qcd is a fundamental aim of modern nuclear physics . as an inherently nonperturbative theory ,",
    "the most rigorous approach to low - energy phenomena in qcd is by numerical simulations in lattice gauge theory .",
    "although restricted at present to the regime of quark masses exceeding those realized in nature , recent advances in effective field theory ( eft ) have made it possible to accurately extract the physical nucleon mass from qcd @xcite .",
    "these advances and breakthroughs in chiral effective field theory ( @xmath0eft ) have their origin in the study of a range of hadron properties in qcd , including nucleon magnetic moments and charge radii @xcite , the nucleon sigma commutator @xcite , moments of structure functions @xcite and the @xmath1-meson mass @xcite .    with the the most detailed studies being on the extrapolation of the nucleon mass , it has been shown that the use of finite - range regularisation ( frr ) enables the most systematically accurate connection of effective field theory and lattice simulation results @xcite .",
    "mathematically equivalent to dimensional regularisation ( dr ) to any finite order , frr chiral effective field theory provides a resummation of the chiral expansion with vastly improved convergence properties .",
    "central to frr is the presence of a finite energy scale which may be used to optimize the convergence properties of the truncated expansion .",
    "the success of frr - eft is highlighted by the observation that the higher - order terms of the traditional dimensionally regulated expansion , although individually large , must sum to zero to describe lattice qcd results .    here",
    "frr-@xmath0eft is applied to nucleon magnetic moments calculated in lattice qcd . in particular , we investigate the modifications required for the extrapolation of quenched simulation results .",
    "issues with the formulation of eft on a finite volume are also discussed .",
    "we consider the modifications to chiral loop integrals on a finite volume and perform a fixed - volume extrapolation .",
    "we extend a phenomenological link between quenched and dynamical baryon masses @xcite to the case of magnetic moments to estimate the artifacts associated with the quenched approximation .",
    "we find that the full qcd corrections of the quenched magnetic moments are small over a wide range of quark mass .",
    "finally , the convergence properties of a truncated taylor - series expansion of the frr results in powers of @xmath2 , analogous to that encountered in dimensional regularisation , are investigated .",
    "we illustrate how any moderate truncation of the series expansion is unable to connect with current lattice simulation results .",
    "the inclusion of higher - order chiral loop corrections associated with the @xmath3 baryon are also considered and found to be small .",
    "in a general construction of an effective field theory for low - energy qcd , the expansion of the nucleon s magnetic moment about the chiral limit can be written as @xmath4 the term @xmath5 denotes the leading nonanalytic ( lna ) chiral correction to the baryon magnetic moment of fig .  [",
    "fig : pilna ] .",
    "coefficients of low - order nonanalytic contributions to nucleon properties are determined model - independently and are known to high precision phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "for example , the lna coefficient to the proton magnetic moment is given by @xmath6 any extrapolation of lattice qcd simulations must incorporate this knowledge of qcd .",
    "the analytic terms are unconstrained by chiral symmetry , and hence must be determined empirically .",
    "lattice qcd provides an _ ab initio _ framework to determine these parameters from qcd .    ,",
    "width=188 ]    the expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) , is analogous to the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass described in refs .",
    "the regulator dependence of the integrals is implicit . to define the expansion",
    "one must define a regularisation and renormalisation scheme to remove ultra - violet divergences",
    ".    in the text - book approach to elementary field theory one commonly uses dimensional regularisation to renormalise the theory . in this case , only the residue of the pion pole becomes apparent and the loop contribution is therefore given by @xmath7 and the linear divergence of the integral is absorbed into an infinite renormalisation of @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , ultra - violet divergences can be removed by suppressing loop integrals above a finite energy scale .",
    "the first systematic study of finite - range regularisation in @xmath0pt  was performed by donoghue et al .",
    "the development of frr-@xmath0pt  in the context of lattice qcd @xcite has found remarkably improved convergence properties of the chiral expansion , providing access to a much wider range of range of quark mass than the naively regularised theory @xcite .",
    "frr is therefore best suited to the problem of chiral extrapolation , where the systematic error in the extrapolation of modern lattice simulations is of order 1% @xcite .",
    "using frr , the loop integral , @xmath9 , in the heavy baryon limit can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the ultra - violet regulator .",
    "expansion of the loop contributions as a power series enables one to obtain the renormalised chiral expansion parameters , where each of the analytic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) are renormalised by a finite amount @xcite .",
    "for example , using a dipole regulator , @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ipi ] ) becomes @xmath14 and the taylor expansion provides @xmath15 therefore , precisely the same lna contribution is recovered @xmath16 with a finite renormalisation of all other terms in the series . by varying @xmath17 , strength in the loop integral may be moved to the residual analytic expansion and vise - versa .",
    "as the moderately large @xmath2 behaviour of the loop integral and the residual expansion are radically different , varying @xmath17 provides an opportunity to optimize the convergence properties of the truncated chiral expansion .",
    "we show the mathematical equivalence of the renormalisation prescriptions to a given order .",
    "the renormalised expansion in dimensional regularisation is @xmath18 and these renormalised coefficients are recovered from the frr expansion via @xmath19 where the second terms compensate the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath20 .    in summary , in working to leading order in the chiral expansion with a dipole frr , the quark mass dependence of nucleon magnetic moments in qcd is @xmath21 the inclusion of an @xmath22 term here is in anticipation of adding nlna terms in the following .",
    "here we address the necessary modifications to the chiral effective field theory for the quenched approximation .",
    "vacuum fluctuations of @xmath23-pairs are absent in quenched simulations . as a result ,",
    "the structure of the low - energy effective field theory is modified .",
    "meson loop diagrams are restricted to only those where the loop is comprised of valence quarks having their origin in the interpolating fields of the baryon correlation function .",
    "this has the effect of modifying the effective @xmath24@xmath25 coupling constants @xcite and the corresponding factors @xmath26 are changed accordingly .    to summarize the lna contributions to nucleon magnetic moments in both quenched and dynamical qcd , we use the standard notation and define @xmath27 and provide the coefficients , @xmath28 , are in table  [ tab : beta ] @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , ( @xmath32 ) .",
    ".coefficients of the leading pion - loop contributions to nucleon magnetic moments in qcd and qqcd.[tab : beta ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     given that the finite - volume corrections are negligible in the regime where the lattice qcd results lie , we illustrate the role of the @xmath3 in frr - eft by taking the lattice results as an accurate representation of the infinite - volume limit and evaluate the loop integrals of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfitd ] ) in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfitd ] ) to lattice results is shown by the dotted curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : delt ] .",
    "the comparison with the leading order result ( solid curve ) shows that the effect of the decuplet on the extrapolation result is negligible .",
    "the new non - analytic behaviour introduced by an explicit inclusion of the @xmath3 was already approximated well by the analytic terms in the expansion at leading order .",
    "although the extrapolation shows little sensitivity to the inclusion of the @xmath3 , it will be necessary to explicitly include this degree of freedom if one is to extract the low - energy constants to this order .",
    "contributions in the extrapolation of the proton magnetic moment .",
    "the solid curve displays the leading - order qqcd extrapolation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfit ] ) , without explicit decuplet contributions , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfit ] . if eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfit ] ) is extended to include the pion contributions with decuplet baryons in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qfitd ] ) , one obtains the dotted curve .",
    "[ fig : delt ] ]    with regard to the estimation of full qcd corrections , the inclusion of the decuplet is again a small effect . with the @xmath3 , the qcd estimate of the proton magnetic moment at the physical quark mass",
    "is increased by @xmath33 from the leading - order result .",
    "although small for the proton , the inclusion of such contributions is found to be important for other baryons of the octet in the extraction of the strangeness magnetic moment of the proton @xcite .    finally , the prediction of the physical proton magnetic moment obtained by including the @xmath3 contributions and compensating for the finite lattice volume is @xmath34 , where the uncertainty is statistical in origin .",
    "this result agrees well with the experimental value of @xmath35 .",
    "quenched and physical magnetic moments are in good agreement over a large range of pion mass .",
    "although pion effects alone are decreased in qqcd , the new behaviour introduced by the @xmath36  acts to suppress any difference .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the dimensionally regularised expansion of the nucleon mass to @xmath37 is convergent to @xmath38 .",
    "we find that to reach similar pion masses in the dr expansion of the magnetic moment one would require knowledge of the chiral expansion to @xmath39 .",
    "the smooth behaviour of the lattice data , together with the series truncations of the frr expansion indicate that although higher - order terms of dr can be individually large they effectively sum to zero in the region of interest .",
    "frr - eft provides an effective resummation of the chiral expansion that ensures that the slow variation of magnetic moments observed in lattice qcd arises naturally in the frr expansion .    finally , by estimating finite volume and quenching effects through the leading one - loop contributions of the finite - range regularized meson cloud",
    ", we obtain an excellent value for the physical magnetic moment of the proton .",
    "combined with the previous success in describing the difference between quenched and full - qcd nucleon and @xmath3 masses @xcite , these results strengthen the argument that artifacts of the quenched approximation can be accurately corrected using phenomenological methods .",
    "ultimately , lattice qcd simulations incorporating light dynamical - quark degrees of freedom on a variety of lattice volumes are required to achieve the goal of an _ ab initio _ determination of nucleon properties .",
    "we would like to thank ian cloet , emily hackett - jones and stewart wright for helpful discussions .",
