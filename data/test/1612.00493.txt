    "complexity is identified by a set of typical features  @xcite , ranging from complex network descriptions  @xcite to chaos on strange attractors .",
    "fractional descriptions lay at the foundation of many such features .",
    "for instance , strange attractors typically have fractional dimension .",
    "complex networks exhibit log - normal or power - law statistics also associated with fractional derivatives  @xcite .",
    "fractional dimension is common in biological systems , e.g. the folds of the brain , the space - filling curve of dna , and the maximization of surface area for gas exchange in the lungs and the branches of trees .",
    "although foundational descriptions of physical phenomena typically take the form of partial differential equations ( pdes ) or ordinary differential equations ( odes ) with derivatives of integer order , for example the diffusion equation , the wave equation , and the schrdinger equation , it has been argued that effective pde - based descriptions of complex phenomena require _ fractional _ partial derivatives  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the generalization of the diffusion equation to fractional derivatives has been found highly effective in describing for instance the propagation of ground water through soil  @xcite , the latter typically exhibiting multiscale properties . to what extent",
    "are fractional descriptions relevant to wave phenomena in general ?",
    "one natural context in which to examine this question is the _ nonlinear schrdinger equation _ ( nlse ) .",
    "the nlse appears in many contexts including the experimentally and theoretically well - established semiclassical effective limit of the quantum many - body description of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite ; the slowly varying envelope approximation for propagation of light in fiber optics  @xcite ; and similar effective descriptions found for spin waves in ferromagnetic films  @xcite . in every case",
    "the nlse is an _ effective _ description , that is , starting from a much more complete but difficult to solve theory , one obtains a single scalar pde / ode that covers much of the observable phenomena in that system .",
    "an outstanding physical question is then the following .",
    "on the one hand fractional differential equations provide an effective description for complex multiscale phenomena in many contexts . on the other hand nonlinear pdes",
    "/ odes such as the nlse are a highly useful simplification to reduce high dimensional or otherwise difficult problems to effective nonlinear differential equations . what is the interplay between these two key classes of effective pde / ode descriptions of complex systems ?",
    "the fractional generalization of the nlse in particular has several useful limits in which the concept of effective theories can be carefully and rigorously explored .",
    "first , the linear limit of the schrdinger equation is of course a well - understood problem .",
    "second , the fractional generalization of the schrdinger equation has been previously explored in many contexts  @xcite .",
    "third , the nlse is an integrable equation with detailed solutions in terms of solitons .",
    "fourth , by performing an imaginary time rotation the schrdinger equation can be transformed to the diffusion equation .",
    "fifth , the fractional diffusion equation , perhaps even more than the fractional schrdinger equation , is a well - studied example with many special cases to draw on .",
    "thus the fractional nlse provides an ideal mathematical context in which to explore the interplay of nonlinearity and fractional derivatives in differential equations .",
    "the basic concept of the fractional derivative is as old as calculus itself , originating in a discussion between lhpital and leibniz . in common usage",
    "now there are several approaches to fractionalize the derivative and several types of fractional derivatives have subsequently been introduced .",
    "the most popular ones are the riemann - liouville and caputo fractional derivatives .",
    "the two definitions differ only in the order of evaluation . in the caputo definition ,",
    "we first compute an ordinary derivative then a fractional integral , while in the riemann - liouville definition the operators are reversed .",
    "it is often useful to apply the caputo derivative in modeling , as mathematical modeling of many physical problems requires initial and boundary conditions , and these demands are satisfied using the caputo fractional derivative . as fractional differential equations ( fdes ) do nt generally possess exact closed form solutions , several analytical and numerical techniques have been implemented to study these equations .",
    "the series solution is one of the common techniques in studying fdes analytically and numerically .",
    "for instance , the variational iteration method ( vim )  @xcite , the homotopy analysis method ( ham )  @xcite , and the adomian decomposition method ( adm )  @xcite , have been implemented to study several types of fdes . for more details",
    "one can refer to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , an efficient series solution was introduced for a class of nonlinear fractional differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the idea is inspired by the taylor series expansion method but it overcomes the difficulty of computing iterated fractional derivatives .    despite these advances , there is no universal agreement on a series approach that unifies solutions to fractional , nonlinear , and fractional nonlinear differential equations . in this paper , we provide such an approach .",
    "moreover , previous power series methods suffer from divergence past a finite radius of convergence .",
    "for example , if one considers the power series expansion of the bright soliton sech solution to the focusing nlse , the radius of convergence is @xmath0 . by extending the power series concept in a spatially iterative approach ,",
    "we are able to move the radius of convergence to arbitrarily large values . to see why this is so important physically , consider the central limit theorem , which underpins statistical mechanics and indeed much of physical measurement in terms of the normal distribution .",
    "the central limit theorem only holds for finite variance .",
    "a well - known feature of the fractional diffusion equation is the power law tails of its localized solutions , which subsequently exhibit divergent variance .",
    "such `` fat - tailed '' distributions lead to not - so - rare rare events and have practical outcomes such as the choice of whether or not to store radioactive waste a given distance from a population center  @xcite .",
    "our method allows us to benefit from the high accuracy and analytical formulation of the power series approach while not being subject to its typical problem with a physically limiting radius of convergence .",
    "we are able to extend the radius of convergence arbitrarily far into the tails of a localized solution , resulting in a clearer picture of the kind of statistics we can expect from the hybridization of nonlinear and fractional simplifications to physical problems .",
    "the common approach to the power series problem for fractional differential equations is an expansion of form @xmath1 this approach works well for linear fractional equations .",
    "however , for nonlinear fractional equations eq .",
    "( [ eqold ] ) has difficulties .",
    "instead , we propose the following fractional power series as a solution : @xmath2 where @xmath3 $ ] denotes the nearest integer larger than @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the value about which the expansion is performed . in comparison with the traditional expansion in powers of @xmath6 of eq .",
    "( [ eqold ] ) , our proposal in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath7 , is more comprehensive in the sense that the former is a subset of the latter .",
    "for instance , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the term @xmath10 will not be present in a power series of @xmath11 , while in our case this will be included .",
    "in addition , such terms couple to the integer power terms in the first sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and to the nonlinear term leading to nontrivial recursion relations .",
    "it is essential for the method developed here that we have the integer power terms in the first sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , which renders the current proposed fractional power series to be a necessity rather than a choice .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath12 is even , our proposed power series will be valid also for the negative spatial domain .    in order to most effectively match the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we take the specific case of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath12 are positive integers . adopting here the caputo sense @xcite for the fractional derivative ,",
    "defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the well - known gamma function , @xmath17 is the @xmath18 order derivative of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath5 is a constant which in our case will turn out to be the left side of the interval of spatial iteration in which we perform our power series expansion . for a power law , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an integer , the caputo fractional derivative reduces to @xmath23 for a shifted power law , @xmath24 , where @xmath5 is real ,",
    "the above expression is not applicable , as it would be in the case of regular derivatives : the chain rule for fractional derivatives takes a different form than an in the integer case . to resolve this matter we resort to the definition in eq .",
    "( [ cdef ] ) to obtain @xmath25 , & 1<\\alpha<2\\,,\\nonumber\\\\     \\\\k(k-1)(x - x_0)^{k-2 } , & \\alpha=2\\ , , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{cdef2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the hypergeometric function and for simplicity we have written out explicitly the solution of the integral to the case @xmath27 ; solutions for other values of @xmath4 can be obtained in the same manner . for physical applications",
    "@xmath27 is especially interesting as it interpolates between linear and quadratic disperson , i.e. , between a phonon and a free particle .",
    "bogoliubov theory also accomplishes such an interpolation  @xcite but fractional derivatives are much more generic , e.g. in terms of capturing transport in a variety of multiscale media .",
    "also , the nonlinear dirac equation , obtained for example by optical means or a bec in a honeycomb lattice  @xcite near the k - point , has a first order spatial derivative and linear dispersion . it should be noted here that eq .",
    "( [ cdef2 ] ) is applicable for @xmath28 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the fractional derivative equals zero for the case of integer @xmath22 .",
    "this is so , since for integer @xmath22 , the expression @xmath30 can be expanded in powers of @xmath31 that are all less than @xmath4 , which , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) will have zero fractional derivative .    for our iterative method it will turn out to be useful to consider the special cases of @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the result of the fractional derivative expanded around @xmath34 : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the euler constant and",

    "( [ cdef3 ] ) diverges as @xmath44 whereas eq .",
    "( [ cdef4 ] ) approaches a constant .",
    "this important observation will be exploited in the construction of the power series that is differentiable at @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the following dimensionless fractional nonlinear schr@xmath45dinger equation ( fnlse ) @xmath46 where @xmath37 is the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "the profile of the stationary solutions , @xmath47 , defined via @xmath48 , obeys the time - independent fnlde @xmath49 where we take @xmath50 and @xmath51 here and throughout such that for @xmath52 the fundamental soliton @xmath53 is an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we note that due to the nonlinear nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the factor of @xmath37 can be absorbed into the normalization without loss of generality , up to a sign : here we treat the focusing case .",
    "likewise , taking @xmath50 incurs no loss of generality , as it is simply a choice of units of time .    as a result of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , the @xmath41-derivative of the first summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) always vanishes .",
    "therefore , the @xmath54 terms do not couple to terms of lower powers and thus correspond to the initial conditions such that for @xmath55 there is one initial condition , for @xmath56 there are two initial conditions , etc . substituting the power series solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath40 , in a nonlinear equation such as the fnlse and using the caputo fractional derivative , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , it is straightforward to derive the recursion relations for @xmath57 in terms of the initial conditions @xmath54 .",
    "however , the resulting power series solution suffers from the typical problem of finite radius of convergence which depends on @xmath4 and equals @xmath0 for @xmath52 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    : ( a ) jacobi elliptic cn - like with nodes ; ( c ) dn - like without nodes . converged iterative fractional nonlinear power series solution introduced for the first time in this paper ( blue curves ) is compared to the rapid divergence of the usual fractional power series ( red dashed curves ) . the well - known exact solutions for the nlse are shown for comparison ( black dotted curves ) .",
    "( right column ) ( b ) , ( d ) : error incurred by our power series approach in each case increases arithmetically but remains below the predicted upper bound .",
    "the initial conditions are : @xmath58 and @xmath59 for ( a ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the number of iterations used is @xmath60.,width=566 ]    to overcome this divergence problem , we implement the following iterative procedure .",
    "first , we divide @xmath31 into @xmath61 segments , each of width @xmath62 .",
    "then we expand the solution starting with initial condition @xmath40 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the resulting power series is then calculated at @xmath63 ; providing the initial conditions for the next expansion around @xmath64 , and so on . however , two important issues need to be addressed before obtaining a well - behaved and convergent iterative power series solution using such an approach . the first is related to the logarithmic divergence of the @xmath41 derivative of @xmath65 , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ cdef3])-([cdef4 ] ) .",
    "the second is related to the convergence of the powers series in the number of iterations , that is , how does the result depend on the number of grid points @xmath61 and choice of interval @xmath66 ?",
    "an immediate problem arises in this procedure : the @xmath41 derivative of the term @xmath65 diverges logarithmically for @xmath67 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ cdef3 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , from eq .",
    "( [ cdef4 ] ) we observe that the @xmath41 derivative of the term @xmath68 does not suffer from such a divergence .",
    "the best approach is thus to expand @xmath47 as follows : @xmath69 in this manner , one avoids the logarithmic divergence . substituting this expansion in eq .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) to give the new recursion relation .",
    "it should be noted here that due to the homogeneity of the differential equation at hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the recursion relation @xmath74 is essentially the same for all iterations , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) for @xmath67 . this procedure is repeated @xmath61 times , leading to a power series free from the intrinsic divergence problem in the original series . in the case of inhomogeneous differential equations ,",
    "where the coefficients of @xmath75 and its derivatives are functions of @xmath31 , the recursion relation @xmath74 will be different for each iteration and has to be calculated at every iteration step .    however , the iterative procedure turns out to suffer from another serious problem .",
    "the solutions do not converge when @xmath76 . in a well - behaved iteration method",
    ", the solution should converge to a certain profile when @xmath61 is sufficiently increased .",
    "careful investigation shows that this problem stems from the fact that the higher derivatives of the iterated power series are not continuous at the boundaries between the @xmath77 and @xmath78 expansions . basically , it is the iterative procedure itself that causes this problem .",
    "when we calculate the series @xmath79 and its derivative @xmath80 and pass these values to the @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the new series , we guarantee the continuity in the solution and its derivative only .",
    "the second derivative and higher derivatives are not continuous due to the fractional powers .",
    "this problem is absent in the case of integer power series but is an intrinsic problem in series with fractional powers . in the following",
    "we present a remedy to this difficulty .",
    "consider series zeroth - order series @xmath81 substituting @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we obtain the first iterated series @xmath84 for the iterated series to be convergent with the number of iterations , @xmath61 , it must be equal to the non - iterated series calculated at @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 applying this condition for @xmath87 , @xmath88 the zeroth- and first - order terms clearly satisfy this condition , but the @xmath41-term acquires an additional factor of @xmath89 .",
    "this requires the replacement @xmath90 in the right hand side of this equation .",
    "here we show the result of the next few iterations : @xmath91a_1x^\\alpha,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the closed form for the general term was found by inspection . applying the condition ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "requires @xmath92 this condition is required to be satisfied in the limit of large @xmath61 , which then takes the form @xmath93 it should be noted that applying any of the last two conditions to the series given by eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) for @xmath67 requires replacing @xmath4 by @xmath94 in the last two equations .",
    "in addition , eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) show that @xmath47 depends on @xmath5 also through @xmath95 .",
    "taking this into account and repeating the iterative procedure described above but now with @xmath96 , which is the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , we obtain finally the correction replacement rule : @xmath97 the appearance of the factor @xmath98 suggests specific fractional values of @xmath13 with @xmath12 being an odd integer .",
    "otherwise , @xmath99 will become complex .",
    "the resulting series for the fnlse corresponds to a host of oscillatory and localized solutions characterized by values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the initial slope of the solution , @xmath73 , will not have a significant effect on the nature of the solutions other than an overall shift along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "inspection shows that generally the solutions are oscillatory apart from localized solutions obtained with some specific values of @xmath72 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot two fundamental solutions of the fnlse using this iterative procedure . as clearly shown in this figure , the power series solution without using the iterative procedure , ( [ eq3 ] ) , diverges at @xmath100 , but after applying our iterative method the divergence is removed .",
    "indeed , implementing the correction procedure solves also the problem of lack of convergence ; the solutions are stable beyond a number of iterations greater than about 2000 .",
    "another criterion that our solutions should satisfy is that they must match the non - iterated series for a range less than the radius of convergence , which is indeed the case , as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also shows . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show a localized solution for different values of @xmath4 with @xmath72 tuned up to a certain precision in order to push oscillations away from the origin to a certain distance .",
    "the analogous localized solution for the @xmath52 case is the fundamental soliton given by @xmath101 , which is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "error in the iterative series solution persists due to terminating the power series at a finite number of terms , say @xmath22 .",
    "it is instructive at this point to estimate the magnitude of this error . terminating the second summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) at @xmath102 results in an error of order @xmath103 .",
    "this error will be magnified @xmath61 times due to the iterative procedure .",
    "therefore , the estimated error in our method is of order @xmath104 this estimate can be taken as an upper bound on the actual error , which we define as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the solution found by the iterative power series . in the right column of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we plot this error as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "we find the error increases linearly with @xmath31 but remains below the upper bound ( [ eq110 ] ) for the parameters used .      in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we explore localized solutions more closely , where we show their dependence on @xmath4 as well as the structure of the tail .",
    "we may loosely call this solution the _ fractional soliton _ , recognizing that for now we have not shown stability .",
    "we note that as @xmath4 decreases the soliton becomes narrower , i.e. , is more strongly localized . this can be understood based on the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion that supports a soliton .",
    "decreasing @xmath4 effectively decreases the strength of the dispersion , and as the nonlinearity is of focusing type , the soliton becomes narrower .",
    "however , we point out that this trend is opposite to that predicted by the usual scaling argument based on a variational calculation of the total energy",
    ". the scaling behavior of eq .  ( [ eq2 ] ) obtained in such a manner would naively be @xmath107 , with @xmath108 an estimate of the width of the fractional soliton , as follows also from the @xmath109 units of @xmath47 .",
    "however , solving for @xmath110 results in @xmath111 , predicting a decreasing width for increasing @xmath4 , clearly in contradiction to the more accurate power series approach . in the future",
    "it would be useful to develop a proper variational analysis via a lagrangian variational dynamical approach  @xcite to obtain a more precise estimate of fractional soliton widths and breathing frequencies .",
    "this requires rethinking the energy contribution of the fractional derivative .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) our iterative power series approach finds that the tail is exponential in nature , in contrast to the well - known power - law behavior for the fractional diffusion equation discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusion ] .",
    "although it would seem the tail of a localized solution of any nonlinear fractional equation should approach the tail of the corresponding linear fractional equation , this is not at all obvious since a tail grows rapidly flat , and one must closely examine the balance between shrinking nonlinearity and decreasing derivative on the tail .",
    "we find the prefactor in the exponential decreases monotonically with @xmath4 .",
    "ranging between linear ( dashed curve ) and quadratic ( dotted curve ) dispersion : @xmath112 .",
