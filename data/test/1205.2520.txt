    "the majority of interesting phenomena in many - body quantum mechanics are in some way associated to the fundamental concept of identical particles and statistics .",
    "elementary identical particles in three spatial dimensions are either bosons , obeying bose - einstein statistics , or fermions , obeying fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the former are usually represented using wave functions which are symmetric under particle permutations , while the latter implement pauli s exclusion principle by exhibiting total anti - symmetry under particle interchange . on the other hand , for point particles living in one and two dimensions",
    "there are logical possibilities different from bosons and fermions , so - called intermediate or fractional statistics .",
    "although first regarded as of purely academic interest  filling the loopholes in the arguments leading to the two standard permutation symmetries  these have recently become a reality in the laboratory , with the advent of trapped bosonic gases @xcite and quantum hall physics @xcite , and thus the discoveries of effective models of particles ( or quasi - particles ) that seem to obey these generalized rules for identical particles and statistics .",
    "we refer to @xcite for extensive reviews on these topics .",
    "although non - interacting bosons and fermions are well understood in terms of single - particle hilbert spaces and operators , the same can not be said about particles obeying these generalized interchange statistics .",
    "namely , despite some effort in this direction @xcite , many - particle quantum states for intermediate and fractional exchange statistics have in general not admitted a simple description in terms of single - particle states restricted by some exclusion principle .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is that the general symmetry of the wave function under particle interchange is naturally modeled using pairwise or many - body interactions , hence leaving the much simpler realm of single - particle hamiltonians ( and also introducing other mathematical difficulties as well , already at the formulation of these models ) .    as a different approach",
    ", we would like to stress in the following that the effects of exclusion are also encoded in inequalities for many - particle energy forms , such as the lieb - thirring inequality @xcite .",
    "for the case of identical spinless fermions in an external potential @xmath0 in @xmath1-dimensional space , it states that there is a _ uniform _ bound for the energy of a normalized @xmath2-particle state @xmath3 : @xmath4 with the @xmath2-particle hamiltonian operator @xmath5 the conventions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and a positive constant @xmath8 .",
    "the inequality incorporates pauli s exclusion principle via the intermediate sum over the negative energy levels @xmath9 of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "it furthermore incorporates the uncertainty principle , and is in fact equivalent to the kinetic energy inequality @xmath11 involving the one - particle density @xmath12 of @xmath3 ; normalized @xmath13 . in dimension @xmath14 , the expression on the r.h.s .",
    "of may be recognized as the kinetic energy approximation from thomas - fermi theory .",
    "it is in this case conjectured @xcite that holds with exactly the thomas - fermi expression on the right .",
    "the best known result is , however , smaller by a factor @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the bounds and need to be weakened in the case of weaker exclusion . in the case that each single - particle state can be filled @xmath16 times ( e.g. in models with @xmath16 spin states , or cp .",
    "gentile intermediate statistics @xcite ) the r.h.s . of the inequalitites",
    "are to be multiplied by @xmath16 resp .",
    "bosons can then be accommodated by @xmath18 , yielding trivial bounds as @xmath19 .    in this work",
    "we wish to report on a new set of lieb - thirring - type inequalities for intermediate and fractional statistics , which follow from a corresponding _ local _ version of the exclusion principle , applicable to such interacting systems .",
    "our approach is very much inspired by the work @xcite of dyson and lenard ( see also @xcite ) , who used only such a local form of the pauli principle to rigorously prove the stability of ordinary fermionic matter in the bulk ( the inequalities and were subsequently invented by lieb and thirring to simplify their proof ) .",
    "although the numerical constants resulting from our method are comparatively weak , we believe the forms of our bounds to be conceptually very useful , and as a result we also learn something non - trivial about the elusive anyon gas .    starting by recalling the models for intermediate and fractional statistics which",
    "we shall be concerned with here , we proceed by showing how a local form of the exclusion principle can be established for such statistics , leading to bounds for the kinetic energy in terms of the one - particle density @xmath20 . for clarity , we leave out some of the technical details , referring to the mathematical papers @xcite , and instead focus on general aspects of the procedure . with these preparations ,",
    "we consider the problem of determining the ground state energy for a large number @xmath2 of anyons in a harmonic oscillator potential , and can conclude that the energy grows like @xmath21 under the assumption that the anyonic statistics phase is an odd numerator rational multiple of @xmath22 . in the final section",
    "we discuss a structural difference between such odd and even numerator fractions using a class of trial states which are related to the read - rezayi states for the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "we recall three well - established models for intermediate and fractional exchange statistics for scalar non - relativistic quantum mechanical particles in one or two spatial dimensions . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "there are by now a number of standard references for their background and derivations , which we will accordingly skip here .",
    "we will mainly follow the notation in @xcite , with technical details addressed in @xcite .",
    "identical particles in 2d , anyons , have the possibility to pick up an arbitrary but fixed phase @xmath23 upon continuous simple interchange of two particles . a standard way to model such ( abelian ) anyons , in the so - called magnetic gauge , is by means of bosons in @xmath24 together with a statistical magnetic interaction given by the vector potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a @xmath27 counter - clockwise rotation of the vector @xmath28 .",
    "this attaches to every particle an aharonov - bohm point flux of strength @xmath29 , felt by all the other particles .",
    "the kinetic energy for @xmath2 such particles is thus given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and the wave function @xmath3 is represented as a completely symmetric square - integrable function on @xmath33 .",
    "the case @xmath34 then corresponds to bosons , and @xmath35 to fermions .",
    "the case of identical particles confined to move in only one spatial dimension is special and in some sense degenerate , since particles can not be interchanged continuously without colliding . in quantum mechanics",
    "this necessitates some choice of boundary conditions for the wave function at the collision points .",
    "it turns out that , depending on which approach one takes to quantization @xcite , identical particles in 1d can again be modeled as bosons , i.e. wave functions symmetric under the flip @xmath36 of any two relative particle coordinates @xmath37 , together with a local interaction potential , singular at @xmath38 and either of the form @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "we write @xmath41 with statistics parameters @xmath42 , for the respective models resulting from a schrdinger- resp .",
    "heisenberg - type approach to quantization .",
    "these statistics potentials correspond to the choices of boundary conditions for the wave function @xmath3 at the boundary @xmath38 of the configuration space @xmath43 here @xmath44 resp .",
    "@xmath34 represent bosons ( neumann b.c . ) while @xmath45 resp .",
    "@xmath35 represent fermions ( dirichlet or analytically vanishing b.c . ; see @xcite ) .",
    "suggested by such pairwise boundary conditions , one may define @xcite the total kinetic energy for a normalized completely symmetric wave function @xmath3 describing @xmath2 identical particles on the full real line @xmath46 to be @xmath47 where @xmath48 in other words , the @xmath49 case in our notation is nothing but the lieb - liniger model for one - dimensional bosons with pairwise dirac delta interactions @xcite , while the @xmath50 case corresponds to the homogeneous part of the calogero - sutherland model with inverse - square interactions .",
    "it is well - known that these models can describe a continuous interpolation between the properties of bosons and fermions for certain ranges of the statistics parameters . for the following results we will restrict to @xmath51 ( lieb - liniger type intermediate statistics ) and @xmath52 ( calogero - sutherland type ` superfermions ' ) for which the statistics potentials are nonnegative , i.e. repulsive .    in all of the above cases , the one - particle density @xmath20 is defined s.t .",
    "the expected number of particles on a local region @xmath53 of space ( typically a @xmath1-dimensional cube in the following ) equals @xmath54 where @xmath55 on @xmath53 and @xmath56 on the complement @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , @xmath58 . similarly , it is useful to be able to speak about the expected kinetic energy of a wave function on a local region . for fermions or bosons",
    "we naturally define this quantity to be @xmath59 analogously for anyons , @xmath60 and for 1d intermediate statistics , @xmath61 @xmath62 note that if the full space @xmath63 has been partitioned into a family of non - overlapping regions @xmath64 then the total kinetic energy decomposes as @xmath65 . we will furthermore write @xmath66 to denote the free kinetic energy for the particular case of fermions in @xmath67 , i.e. totally antisymmetric @xmath3 .",
    "the starting point for our energy bounds will be the following local consequence of the pauli exclusion principle for fermions , which was used by dyson and lenard in their proof of stability of matter @xcite : let @xmath3 be a wave function of @xmath68 spinless fermions in @xmath67 , i.e. anti - symmetric w.r.t .",

    "we call the following observation a _ local exclusion principle _ for generalized exchange statistics since it implies that the local kinetic energy is nonzero whenever we have more than one particle , and hence that the particles can not occupy the same single - particle state ( which on a local region would be the zero - energy ground state ) .    given any finite interval @xmath104 of length @xmath105 , we have for @xmath51 @xmath106 and for @xmath52 @xmath107 while for a square @xmath108 with area @xmath105 and any @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",

    "this proves in the @xmath52 calogero - sutherland case .",

    "the constant @xmath129 is actually @xmath2-dependent , and it is clear from the definition that this constant can become identically zero for sufficiently large @xmath2 if @xmath96 is an even numerator ( reduced ) fraction .",

    "the inequalities and for fermions combine the pauli exclusion principle with the uncertainty principle to produce non - trivial and useful bounds for the energy as the number of particles @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "we shall complement the local form of the exclusion principle above with the following _ local form of the uncertainty principle _ on a @xmath1-dimensional cube @xmath53 , valid for the free kinetic energy of any bosonic wave function @xmath3 , and hence applicable in our cases of intermediate statistics after discarding the positive statistics potentials or , in the case of anyons , using the diamagnetic inequality @xmath133 : @xmath134 the constants @xmath135 only depend on @xmath1 .",

    "( the bound is strongest for cubes @xmath53 s.t .",
    "the expected number of particles to be found on @xmath53 is @xmath136 ) , one can then prove the following energy bounds :    for any @xmath109 , the free kinetic energy for @xmath2 anyons satisfies the bound @xmath137 for some constant @xmath138 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath130 is a reduced fraction with odd numerator @xmath139 and the density @xmath12 is supported on an area @xmath140 then @xmath141     as a function of @xmath96 . ]    for @xmath51 @xmath142 for some constant @xmath143 .",

    "we sketch a proof below only for the simpler anyonic case , and refer to @xcite for further details . for an application of the same method to fermions in 3d and the generalization to @xmath16 spin states we refer to @xcite where a model for point interactions was considered .",
    "let us for simplicity assume @xmath12 to be supported on some square @xmath160 in the plane which we proceed to split into four smaller squares iteratively , organizing the resulting subsquares @xmath53 in a tree @xmath161 ( see fig .",

    "note that if @xmath190 ( which could occur for certain @xmath2 and rational @xmath96 as long as the r.h.s . is an even integer ) then this bound reduces to the bosonic bound for the energy , which is always valid as a trivial lower bound .",
    "it was in @xcite argued using perturbation theory that the behavior for the exact ground state energy as @xmath19 is approximately @xmath191 for @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath194 , requiring @xmath195 by .",
    "in fact , we can show that the ground state energy necessarily always satisfies the upper bound @xmath196 , up to a constant independent of @xmath96 .",
    "namely , given a ( possibly non - symmetric ) @xmath2-particle wave function @xmath197 s.t .",

    "after splitting the real line into intervals big enough to contain a sufficient number of particles , the local bound can be applied on each such interval with the addition of an external potential , thereby obtaining an energy functional and lower estimates for the ground state energy ( along with estimates for the corresponding ground state density ) .",

    "we give some motivation for why this could be the case by considering the following observations .    in these bounds",
    "the expression @xmath224 appears as a measure of exclusion .",
    "its complicated behavior in @xmath96 and @xmath2 is related to the fact that only for even numerator fractions do the anyons appear to have the possibility to completely cancel out the statistical phase which is responsible for a local repulsive force between them , by assuming certain configurations .",

    "namely , while the jastrow factor acts to attract all particles , this attraction is on large scales exactly balanced whenever a group of @xmath132 non - repelling anyons has formed , since an anyon @xmath254 far outside the group , seeing the total attractive factor @xmath255 where @xmath84 is the distance from the group , is also repelled by at least one anyon @xmath256 in the group , with a factor @xmath257 from that corresponding edge in @xmath242 .",

    "furthermore , the total contribution from such a group to the statistics potential @xmath207 seen by the distant particle @xmath254 would be @xmath258 , while the particle also has an orbital angular momentum @xmath259 around the group ( due to that same edge to @xmath256 and phase of @xmath253 ) with velocity @xmath260 , again leading to a cancellation of terms in the kinetic energy @xmath261 .    the forms and bring out a structural difference between even and odd numerators @xmath139 .",
    "the limit @xmath35 of is the fermionic ground state in the bosonic representation , and also generalizes to the correct gauge copies for arbitrary integer @xmath96 , while the states with @xmath262 in are ( modulo the jastrow factor ) actually found to be exactly the read - rezayi states for fractional quantum hall liquids in their bosonic form @xcite .",
    "the state is an exact but singular ( requiring the regularization by @xmath237 ) eigenstate of the hamiltonian with energy @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the total degree of the non - gaussian part of the wave function ( cp . ) . in all",
    "known exact eigenstates there is this simple correspondence between the degree and the energy .",
    "it is an interesting fact that adding the degree of @xmath237 in the nearest - neighbor form produces @xmath265 , i.e. exactly the r.h.s . of for the above value of @xmath147 , speaking for a low energy for even numerator fractions . on the other hand",
    ", the degree of the odd numerator states necessarily grows with @xmath244 as @xmath266 due to the slater determinant . while the resulting energy @xmath267 satisfies but does not match the bound exactly w.r.t .",
    "@xmath96 , a corresponding picture of ideal anyons forming essentially free @xmath132-anyon groups with fermionic type statistics would actually match the form of the bound , involving the reduced density @xmath268 .",
    "we finally remark that there are also many interesting connections between the forms of the fractions appearing here and those of fractionally charged quantum hall quasiparticles .",
    "another question concerns possible relations with @xmath16-commutation relations , with @xmath269 .",
