    "a key distinguishing feature of quantum physics from classical physics is the prediction of a new kind of correlation between physical quantities , called entanglement .",
    "quantum entanglement has been often been referred to as the inseparability of composite quantum systems .",
    "such an entangled composite system is said to be inseparable because it can not be prepared by manipulating each subsystem separately , using only measurements and operations local to one subsystem at a time .",
    "if a composite quantum mechanical state is specified by some density matrix , how can we tell if the system is entangled ?",
    "much work has been done studying the particular case of two subsystems , with each in a two dimensional hilbert space ( qubits ) .",
    "there is a good understanding of the entanglement for such systems and in fact a criterion , the partial transposition condition of peres@xcite , indicates whether the subsystems are entangled .",
    "this , however , is a necessary and sufficient condition only when there are two subsystems , one with hilbert space dimension @xmath0 , and the other of dimension @xmath0 or @xmath1 , as was shown by the horodeckis@xcite . for more complex systems",
    ", it only determines whether the state contains distillable entanglement , however there are also some states with bound entanglement , which are lumped together with the separable states by this criterion .",
    "lewenstein _ et .",
    "al._@xcite have used the peres condition to consider two subsystems , but with each subsystem now in a @xmath2 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "yczkowski _ et .",
    "al._@xcite have , among other results , shown that all the mixed states in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the maximally mixed state are separable .",
    "they also gave a bound on the size of this neighbourhood for small composite systems .",
    "vidal and tarrach@xcite gave a lower bound on the size of this neighbourhood for arbitrary composite states , of any number of subsystems .",
    "schack and caves@xcite gave bounds for composite systems composed of many qubits ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it has been pointed out by braunstein _ et .",
    "al._@xcite that maximally - entangled states of the ghz type , with noise added , are connected to recent proposals for nmr quantum computing .",
    "they are also relevant to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics using bell inequalities .",
    "the separability of such noisy generalised singlet states has been considered by various authors recently , mostly for the case of qubits ( subsystems with hilbert space dimension two ) .",
    "schack and caves@xcite , using the approach of braunstein _ et .",
    "al . _ have obtained an exact boundary condition for the werner states@xcite ( two qubits ) , while caves and milburn@xcite extended the approach to two q - trits ( hilbert space dimension three ) .",
    "the horodeckis@xcite gave exact bounds for the case of two subsystems .",
    "in this paper we extend the approach of peres@xcite to consider such noisy generalised singlet states in the general case of @xmath4 subsystems with each subsystem in a @xmath5 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "a parameter @xmath6 specifies the amount of the pure ghz - type maximally - entangled states present compared with the maximally - mixed noise state.we then ask and answer the following question : what is the maximum value of @xmath6 for this state to be entangled ?",
    "another fundamental question is also considered . to create as entangled a state as possible ,",
    "is it simply better to increase the dimension of the subsystems or is it better to increase the number of subsystems ?",
    "the states considered here , consist of a mixture of the maximally - mixed noise states , and the ghz - type entangled states , where the number @xmath4 of subsystems over which entanglement occurs , and the hilbert space dimension @xmath5 of each subsystem ( equal for all @xmath4 subsystems ) can take on any values @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the relative proportion of ghz - type states is controlled by the parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 corresponds to a pure ghz - type state , while @xmath11 corresponds to the maximally mixed state .",
    "explicitly , the state is given by the density operator    [ p= ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 here @xmath14 represents one of @xmath5 complete orthogonal basis states for the @xmath15 subsystem , while @xmath16 is the density operator for the maximally mixed state , and @xmath17 for the ghz - like state .",
    "the werner state@xcite , consisting of a singlet state and some noise , is the simplest @xmath18 case , hence we call these generalised werner states .",
    "the state @xmath19 can be viewed as a generalised singlet state @xmath17 after it has emerged from a depolarising channel .",
    "the separability of particular cases of the state ( [ p= ] ) , and of more general states , has been considered previously by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "firstly , it was shown @xcite that for the two - qubit ( @xmath20 ) case , ( the werner state ) @xmath19 is separable for , and entangled otherwise , whereas for three qubits ( @xmath21 ) , schack and caves@xcite found the state to be separable for . soon after , horodecki and horodecki@xcite found the exact result for arbitrary numbers of qubits : @xmath22 schack and caves also found bounds on the size of the separable neighbourhood around the maximally mixed state for totally general states of many qubits ( @xmath3 ) . for and",
    "these are and respectively , and for higher @xmath4 are given by @xmath23    what about the more general case when @xmath5 and @xmath4 are arbitrary ? for what values of @xmath9",
    "is the state given by ( [ p= ] ) separable ?",
    "vidal and tarrach@xcite gave a maximum bound for the random robustness @xmath24 of arbitrary multi - component states .",
    "for the states considered here , the critical value of @xmath9 at which the states change from being entangled to separable is ( in the notation of ref.@xcite ) . so according to that bound",
    ", @xmath25    we will prove in the next section ( section  [ proof ] ) that the states given by ( [ p= ] ) , are always entangled if @xmath26 that this bound is strong for qubits ( ) is shown in appendix  ( [ strong ] ) , and an explicit decomposition into product states is given for the case of separable @xmath19 .",
    "peres@xcite has shown that a necessary condition for a state consisting of two subsystems to be separable is that the partial transpose of the density matrix over one of the subsystems , and the partial transpose over the other subsystem , have positive eigenvalues .",
    "however , this is a necessary and sufficient condition only when one of the subsystems has hilbert space dimension @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and the other dimension @xmath0 , as was shown by the horodeckis@xcite .",
    "that paper went on to give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be separable .",
    "nevertheless the peres condition is just what is needed for an upper bound on @xmath9 for separable states .",
    "i.e. any states which break the condition are entangled , although some which satisfy it may also be , but do not have to be , entangled .",
    "it is worth noting that any states which satisfy the peres condition but are entangled are said to contain only `` bound '' entanglement , as it can not be used for teleportation , nor distilled by the process of entanglement distillation .",
    "firstly , note that the peres condition is easily extended to more than two entangled subsystems .",
    "if there are @xmath4 subsystems , one simply chooses some group of original subsystems to be called half - system number @xmath27 , and the remaining subsystems to be called half - system number @xmath0 .",
    "if for any such group of subsystems , an eigenvalue of the partial transpose of @xmath19 over half - system number @xmath27 ( say ) is negative , then @xmath19 is entangled .",
    "thus to use the peres condition to full advantage , one must consider all such groups of subsystems .",
    "the state ( [ p= ] ) is convenient in this respect , because it is unchanged under relabeling of the subsystems ( evident by inspection ) .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath28 , the partial transpose of @xmath19 over the set @xmath29 of subsystems , need only be looked at for @xmath30 ( rounded down ) sets of subsystems to extract the maximum benefit from the peres condition . in particular , a choice of sets of subsystems can be @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 contains the labels of the subsystems to be considered as members of the @xmath34th half - system .",
    "firstly let s consider @xmath35 , i.e. the first subsystem s entanglement with the remaining @xmath36 of them .",
    "the partially transposed density matrix is    [ pt1= ] @xmath37    since all of the elements of @xmath19 , ( hence @xmath38 ) are finite , the eigenvalues of @xmath38 must also be finite .",
    "now , exploiting the general continuity property of eigenvalues of @xmath39 , we conclude that at the value of above which the peres condition indicates the state is entangled , one or more eigenvalues of @xmath38 must be zero , since they are all positive for , and at least one is negative for .",
    "i.e. for some nonzero eigenvector @xmath40 we must have @xmath41 .",
    "expanded , this gives @xmath42 equation ( [ ptpsi ] ) can explicitly be written out as @xmath43 equations @xmath44 where @xmath45 if @xmath46 , @xmath47 otherwise . now if one or more of the @xmath48 does not equal @xmath49 , then that equation is satisfied only if @xmath10 or @xmath50 .",
    "the first case is not of interest here , as @xmath10 corresponds to our maximally entangled ghz like states , so we choose @xmath51 .",
    "the rest of the equations where @xmath52 , separate into @xmath53 coupled sets of two equations of the identical form @xmath54 these have solutions if @xmath55 , but this would imply @xmath56 , which was specifically excluded in ( [ eigenvector ] ) .",
    "otherwise , these coupled two equations are only satisfied if @xmath57 so for @xmath58 , at least one such coupled set of two equations leads to the expression ( [ eo ] ) .",
    "this is the only candidate for the point where the peres condition becomes satisfied .",
    "now it can be easily seen that in the total - noise case @xmath59 , @xmath60 and all the eigenvalues of @xmath38 are @xmath61 . in the no - noise case ( @xmath10 ) , proceeding in similar fashion to before , the eigenvalues @xmath62 of @xmath38 must satisfy @xmath63 this gives @xmath64 if for some @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and leads to sets of two coupled equations of the form @xmath67 these have the solutions @xmath55 or @xmath68 as before , for nonzero eigenvectors , the first can not be true .",
    "so , finally , for the no - noise state , at least one eigenvalue of @xmath38 must be negative , and equal to @xmath69 thus , finally , since @xmath70 is the only value of @xmath9 where an eigenvalue of @xmath38 is zero , all eigenvalues are positive for @xmath59 , and an eigenvalue is negative for @xmath10 , there must be at least one negative eigenvalue for @xmath71 given by ( [ eo ] ) .    when one proceeds in the same fashion when @xmath72 , one always gets coupled sets of two equations identical in form to ( [ eigeqn ] ) , as can be seen by inspection , so nothing new is found .",
    "thus the result of section  ( [ state ] ) is indicated .",
    "for the qubit case ( @xmath3 ) , as seen in figure  ( [ n=2 ] ) , equation ( [ eo= ] ) gives an exact bound on the values of @xmath9 that divide separable from entangled states of the form ( [ p= ] ) . one",
    "sees that the upper bound  ( [ vtbound ] ) derived from the work of vidal and tarrach comes very close to the exact value for the qubit case .",
    "this exact bound is also greater than those lower bounds previously found by schack and caves@xcite , as expected",
    ".    for the two - subsystem ( @xmath73 ) case , the bound ( [ eo= ] ) agrees with the exact one found by the horodeckis@xcite .    for other values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the results on random robustness by vidal and tarrach , lead to an upper bound which is considerably weaker than the upper bound  ( [ eo= ] ) given by the partial transposition condition .",
    "the upper bound found here , actually gives a stronger bound on the random robustness of entanglement of states given by  ( [ p= ] ) .",
    "@xmath74    it is interesting to note that in the border cases when @xmath3 or @xmath73 , the bound  ( [ eo= ] ) is in fact an exact bound .",
    "this is despite the fact that the peres condition does not necessarily give a strong bound for such states .",
    "this leads one to the tentative conjecture that for noisy ghz - type states of the form ( [ p= ] ) , the peres condition may in general give a strong upper bound .",
    "looking at figure  ( [ vard ] ) , one sees that as the hilbert space dimension of the subsystems increases , the upper bound on @xmath9 rapidly decreases , indicating that the entanglement becomes stronger .    as the bound ( [ eo= ] )",
    "is completely general in @xmath5 and @xmath4 , it does provide some answers to the question of what raises entanglement more : creating more entangled subsystems , or increasing their dimension ?",
    "since the bound on @xmath9 decreases exponentially with @xmath4 , but only polynomially with @xmath5 , one concludes that increasing the number of subsystems is a more effective way of increasing the entanglement .",
    "the results presented here based on the peres condition provide a lower bound on the parameters @xmath9 in  ( [ p= ] ) above which the generalised werner states are always entangled .",
    "furthermore , it gives an exact bound on this parameter for the case of many qubits .",
    "an explicit simple expression is derived that depends on @xmath4 , the number of subsystems over which entanglement occurs , and @xmath5 the hilbert space dimension of each subsystem .",
    "apart from the few cases ( @xmath73;@xmath3 and @xmath75 ) where this bound was known exactly previously , the new bounds are stronger than previously known ones .",
    "this work also sheds light on the question of whether to increase quantum entanglement in a system , is it better to create more entangled subsystems , or to increase the dimension of the existing subsystem . as the bound on @xmath9 decreases exponentially with @xmath5 , but only polynomially with @xmath4 , increasing the number of subsystems is a much more effective way of increasing entanglement .    to conclude",
    ", the peres partial transposition condition has provided a good upper bound for determining the separability of a generalised @xmath5 , @xmath4 werner state .",
    "however for other systems it is known that this transposition condition fails to give strong results , thus when this condition is useful , and when not , remains an interesting question .",
    "we wish to show that the bound  ( [ eo= ] ) is exact for qubits ( @xmath3 ) , and to find the product states which combine to give the state when it is separable .            by analogy with the results of schack and caves",
    "@xcite , it has been guessed that an expansion of @xmath83 in terms of the density matrices @xmath84 is given by the following : @xmath85 here the sum is over all permutations of @xmath4 indices @xmath86 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "2 .   the number of @xmath88 is even ( or zero ) .",
    "if the number of @xmath89 is a multiple of four ( or is zero ) , then the number of is even ( or zero ) .",
    "if the number of @xmath89 is not a multiple of four , then the number of is odd .",
    "the proof of this proceeds by starting with the above guess , and showing that it is a correct one .",
    "as it turns out , the hard work is in actually writing down the guess mathematically , so let us begin with this .    to begin with ,",
    "note that @xmath90 where the sum is over _ all _ permutations of @xmath4 indices @xmath91 . also note that @xmath92 will give a sum over all these permutations , except that all terms which have an odd number of indices in @xmath93 will be subtracted rather than added like in @xmath94 .",
    "thus one can see that        now consider some more similar expressions .",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 will give a sum over all index permutations , except that all terms which have an odd number of indices in @xmath100 will be subtracted rather than added like for @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 will give a similar sum over all permutations , but terms in which the number of indices in @xmath103 is a multiple of four ( or is zero ) will be added , terms in which this number is even , but not a multiple of four , will be subtracted , terms in which this number is one more than a multiple of four will be added and multiplied by @xmath104 , and terms for which this number is one less than a multiple of four will be subtracted and multiplied by @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 @xmath106 is the complex conjugate of @xmath102 .",
    "it can be seen ( after a little thought ) that @xmath107 $ ] will give a sum over only those terms in which the number of indices in @xmath100 is a multiple of four ( or is zero ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath108 $ ] will give a sum over only those terms in which the number of indices in @xmath100 is even , but not a multiple of four .",
    "and one can define expressions for @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 analogously to equations  ( [ r ] ) .",
    "so following the same reasoning as previously , the sum of all terms in which the number of indices in @xmath100 is a multiple of four , and the number of indices in @xmath93 is even is given by @xmath113.\\ ] ]    and thus finally , the sum in the second term of the guess @xmath114 ( equation  ( [ expguess ] ) ) can be written @xmath115   + \\frac{1}{4 } [   { \\cal r}_0^o + { \\cal r}_1^o -{\\cal r}_2^o -{\\cal   r}_3^o]\\nonumber \\\\",
    "= \\frac{1}{4 } [ { \\cal t}_0 + { \\cal t}_1 + { \\cal s}_2 + { \\cal s}_3 ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "so the guess that has been made ( i.e. equation  ( [ expguess ] ) ) can be rewritten @xmath116,\\ ] ] which is explicitly ( via the expressions  ( [ t0 ] ) , ( [ s0 ] ) , ( [ t1 ] ) , ( [ si ] ) ) a positive sum of direct tensor products of density matrices , and thus is separable .",
    "the only question that remains is whether @xmath117 ?",
    "so @xmath119 which only seemingly differs from equation  ( [ rho ] ) by the first term , but using the expression for @xmath120 ( [ ec ] ) , one finds that these first terms are equal also .",
    "@xmath121 so @xmath122 , the guess was correct , and thus the bound @xmath120 is strong .",
