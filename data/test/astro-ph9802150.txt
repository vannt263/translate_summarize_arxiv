    "while not the `` main characters '' in the academy colloquium , actively star  forming galaxies are now routinely discovered and made available for study through color  selection . @xmath4 and @xmath2dropouts , galaxies targeted for the redshifted lyman limit spectral discontinuity at 912   in the @xmath4 and @xmath2bands , are important in the early universe because of their ubiquity ( _ c.f .",
    "_ steidel _ et al._1996a , b ) .",
    "the @xmath4drops are several percent of the total deep number counts at @xmath5 ( corresponding to @xmath6 ) , with an absolute surface density of @xmath7 galaxies per square arcminute on the sky .",
    "moderate power radio sources are far less numerous , with surface densities of @xmath8 radio sources per square arcminute at @xmath9mjy .    in an informal collaboration with",
    "c.  steidel and m.  pettini , we have pursued moderate resolution observations of the brightest ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 star  forming galaxies discovered by steidel and collaborators ( _ e.g. _ , steidel & hamilton 1992 ; steidel _ et al .  _",
    "typical sources are at @xmath11 and require long integrations at keck with the lris spectrograph . for the fainter and ( usually ) more distant @xmath2drop galaxies ( @xmath12 ) , lower spectral resolution is obtained .",
    "this work is part of an ongoing effort to study ` normal ' , _ i.e. _ , non  agn , young galaxies at the earliest cosmic epochs .",
    "the spectral character spanned by our current @xmath4drop sample is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the galaxy spectra have been aligned in their rest frames , so that the rather large range in emission and absorption strengths is easily visible . in particular , note the bimodal ly@xmath1 morphology ; the variation in strength of the p ",
    "cygni line profiles due to o  star winds ( _",
    "e.g._c  iv@xmath131548,1551 ; si  iv@xmath131394,1403 ) ; as well as the variation of the primarily interstellar lines such as si  ii@xmath141260 , o  i@xmath141302 , c  ii@xmath141335 , fe  ii@xmath141608 , and al  ii@xmath141670  ( see table  1 ) .    to be more specific ,",
    "note that ly@xmath1 emission is strong and slightly asymmetric with a broader red wing in hdfff  d16 ( from the hdf flanking field ) and q0000  d6 ( from a quasar field , steidel & hamilton 1992 ) , while ly@xmath1 is a broad absorption feature in cb58 ( the lensed galaxy behind the cluster ms1512 + 36 , yee _ et al .",

    "a trend is also visible in the growth of the stellar , stellar  wind , and ism absorptions as one proceeds down the fig .",
    "1 spectra from hdfff  d16 to cb58 .",
    "the strength of the metallic ism absorptions correlates with ly@xmath1 absorption and anti  correlates with ly@xmath1 emission , though the general shape of the local uv continuum over @xmath15  suggests that the galaxies considered here all have an ample supply of ionizing photons .",
    "a simple scenario with a smooth distribution of cold , neutral gas and a moderate or increasing metal abundance level as one goes down fig .",
    "1 toward cb58 would be consistent with our spectra .",
    "the spectra of some distant star  forming galaxies , such as hdfff  d16 and the mean hdf @xmath4dropout spectrum of lowenthal _ et al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) show weak p  cygni and ism lines suggestive of low metal abundance , perhaps even below that of the o  stars in the smc ( near 1/5@xmath16 solar from uv spectra ; walborn _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , haser _",
    "et al._1998 ) .",
    "stellar winds , ism , and the few weak photospheric absorption lines are relatively strong , however , in hdf4 - 555.1 and cb58 , implying an abundance level near solar for these two galaxies at @xmath17 , though abundances estimated from saturated lines should of course be treated with caution .    the presence of weak but definite p  cygni line profiles of the nominal ism absorptions from low ",
    "ionization species such as o  i@xmath141302  and c  ii@xmath141335  is surprising : o  stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds do not show p ",
    "cygni profiles for their low  ionization resonance lines , nor are these features seen in the few high  quality hst spectra of nearby star  burst galaxies ( _ c.f._heckman & leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "one speculative idea we may offer is that these lines may be caused by the onset of a `` galactic superwind '' in young systems with extreme star ",
    "formation rates , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath18 ( for a low  density open universe and @xmath19 ) . here",
    "the ionization level of outflowing gas may be lower than in individual galactic o  stars .",
    "hst uv spectra of nearby star ",
    "bursts like m82 might be helpful future comparison objects .",
    "dust reddening is a poorly  constrained but important issue for these distant star ",
    "burst systems ; a slightly  reddened uv continuum can lead to substantially underestimating the true integrated luminosities .",
    "we have compared the spectrum of the hotdog galaxy ( hdf4 - 555.1 ) to iue  based stellar models by leitherer _",
    "et al .  _",
    "we find that the galaxy spectrum is well fit by the oldest of leitherer _ et al .",
    "_ s continuous star formation synthetic models ( a population age of at least 9 myrs and a stellar upper mass boundary of @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus the deep uv light from the galaxy is still dominated by ob  stars .",
    "the shape of the continuum is consistent with a visible extinction of @xmath21 , implying extinction @xmath22 times higher at the @xmath23  continuum .",
    "these conclusions are based on a poorly known extinction curve , and the unknown placement of the ob  stars and the geometry of the dust leads to further uncertainty .",
    "the deepest portion of the ly@xmath1 absorption profile in the hotdog galaxy is likely to arise from the stellar photospheres augmented by additional interstellar gas ; modeling suggests @xmath24 ( a border  line damped ly@xmath1 system ) , roughly consistent with the strength of the metallic ism lines and the above  mentioned dust extinction .",
    "an age of several tens of myr for the dominant stellar population is consistent with fitting the broad  band optical / near  ir colors to the ( dust  reddened ) models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , although this should be treated as lower limit as it is comparable to the dynamical time , and synchronizing star bursts across the galaxy on time  scales less than this is probably aphysical .    on the best spectra of q0000",
    "d6 we resolve two high  velocity systems separated by @xmath25 ; large scale galactic winds driven by sne may be consistent with this dynamical complexity .",
    "however , we note that giavalisco",
    "_ et al .  _",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that q0000  d6 is dynamically  relaxed , on account of its @xmath26 de  vaucouleurs profile .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the multiple velocity components we observe .",
    "it is conceptually straightforward , but observationally intensive , to continue the lyman ",
    "limit imaging to yet higher redshifts .",
    "deep imaging in the photometric bands of @xmath27 , or the gunn system bands including @xmath28 , can be used to select @xmath2dropout candidates , implying @xmath29 4 , instead of the @xmath4dropouts at @xmath29 3 discussed above .",
    "our _ entre _ to this subfield came from @xmath27 images around the distant radio galaxy 6c0140 + 326 ( @xmath30 ; rawlings _ et al._1996 ) .",
    "the keck direct images go quite faint , so in september 1997 we located @xmath31 potential @xmath2dropouts and observed 6 of them spectroscopically with keck / lris using a slit mask ( _ c.f .  _ dey _ et al .",
    "these targets range in reshift from @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "none have the redshift of the ( centrally positioned ) radio galaxy !",
    "redshifts in excess of 4.5 would have been allowed by our photometric constraints .",
    "four of the six galaxies show moderate to strong ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "two show broad absorption at ly@xmath1 .",
    "si  ii@xmath141260  is seen in absorption in several of the six @xmath2drops .",
    "c  iv@xmath131548,1551  with a ( noisy ) p  cygni profile is detected in 4 of the galaxies .",
    "all the systems show some lyman forest discontinuity at @xmath141216 ; in four of them it is quite strong with a flux ratio @xmath34 across the break .",
    "the one consistent feature of the @xmath2drop spectral continua is that the galaxy flux is at or very close to zero below @xmath35 .",
    "inspection of the spectrum below ly@xmath1 show that all have no flux at @xmath36 , but a detectable weak continuum near @xmath37  ( the ly@xmath38 region ) .",
    "future papers will be more quantitative about this discontinuity .",
    "we note , however , that since radiation that can ionize hydrogen is undetected in any of our @xmath2drop galaxies it is implausible that ionizing radiation from young galaxies can replace the qso ionization at @xmath39 , even considering that the co  moving space density of radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars is known to decline after their @xmath40 peak .",
