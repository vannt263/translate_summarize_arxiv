    "in the course of a nova eruption , a significant amount of material ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) is ejected , which can form a visible shell around the system .",
    "observation of this shell can lead to accurate distances to the novae via the expansion parallax method . for this reason , searches for nova shells have been undertaken by various groups ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . with the distance in hand , one can then determine the luminosity of the system at maximum light , which can be used to calibrate the maximum magnitude - rate of decline relation .",
    "use of this relation can allow for determinations of the distance to objects such as the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "when we embarked on a survey of nova remnants with small telescopes to measure nova shell line fluxes , we did not expect to make a contribution to the study of nova shell morphology and the nova luminosity calibration . nevertheless , the results ( including the discovery of 4 previously undetected shells ) , combined with data collected at larger earthbound telescopes and with _ hubble space telescope _ , encouraged us to attempt a derivation of nova distances and luminosities at maximum and minimum .",
    "we constructed maximum magnitude - rate of decline relations , based on the standard light curve parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and also studied the distribution of minimum magnitudes .    the use of novae as distance indicators poses more problems than that of other methods based on variable stars . while novae are brighter than pulsating variables , their light curve characteristics require a monitoring with high time resolution ( a day or better ) , and the determination of the decline rate requires close monitoring until a given object declines by two or three magnitudes .",
    "the nova luminosity calibration might be done on a purely photometric basis , using ( unreddened ) novae in extragalactic systems ( m31 , magellanic clouds ) .",
    "however , we would need to tie the novae into the distance ladder by pulsating variables or binaries , thus introducing possible systematic errors of the distance scale .",
    "the other approach is the expansion parallax method , which combines the angular expansion rate ( observed several years or decades after outburst ) with radial velocity observations during outburst or at later stages .",
    "this approach is also open to systematic errors .",
    "well - observed novae give evidence that mass ejection is not spherical , and inclination effects play an important role .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity of the shell of a given nova is often variable with time , even if we restrict ourselves to the observation of the `` principal system '' .",
    "high and low velocity material is present , the slower material sometimes shows signs of acceleration .",
    "similar problems arise in the determination of angular expansion rates , since the bright nebular structures are often immersed in a more extended fuzz .",
    "the more rapidly expanding shell becomes increasingly fainter ( a phenomenon which is also seen in the ` sharpening ' of the nebular emission line profiles in nova spectra in the course of the outburst ) , making the measurement of the shell size more difficult .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the spectral emission line maxima and brightest features in the resolved shells , we still encounter a major problem , since these condensations are often arranged in an inclined `` equatorial ring '' .",
    "a combination of both methods is the derivation of the form of the maximum magnitude - rate of decline ( mmrd ) calibration from an extragalactic sample , while determining its zero point calibration using galactic novae .",
    "additional problems are the determination of the proper light maximum ( sometimes it is uncertain whether the observed maximum is the true maximum , especially when spectral observations in early stages are lacking ) and the amount of interstellar absorption ( most galactic novae are concentrated towards the galactic plane ) .    galactic novae with a well - covered maximum ( to obtain the rate of decline ) , uv observations at the nebular or minimum stage ( to derive the reddening from line ratios or the 2200   band ) , and a well - resolved shell ( to derive the kinematic characteristics ) , are extremely rare .",
    "only a handful of novae fulfill these criteria , and a luminosity calibration based on small number statistics may suffer from systematic effects , such as the effect of white dwarf masses or chemical composition on the luminosity .",
    "thus we tried to use all novae for which expansion parallax data are available , by making at some points `` educated guesses '' or using `` brute averaging '' .",
    "this certainly puts a lot of arbitrariness in the calibration , but we hope that this fairly extensive data base , which will not be augmented considerably for a long time , gives a reasonable insight in the present state of the art of novae as distance calibrators , if one deals with available , and not ideal , samples .",
    "the observations were obtained on 1998  march  21 - 23 with dutch 0.9 m telescope at the eso la silla observatory , using a tek tk512cb chip ( @xmath7 pixels ) with a scale of @xmath8/pixel .",
    "further observations were obtained at the kitt peak national observatory on 1998  may  28 - june  1 with the 2.1 m telescope using the tek `` t1ka '' chip ( @xmath9 pixels with a scale of @xmath10/pixel ) and on 1998  june  30 with the 0.9 m telescope using the tek `` t2ka '' chip ( @xmath11 pixels with a scale of @xmath12/pixel ) .",
    "the data were obtained with narrow band filters centered at h@xmath0 ( 80  fwhm at eso , 36  at kpno ) and [ o  iii ]  @xmath15007 ( 55  at eso , 31  at kpno ) , as well as off - band and _ ubvr _ filters ; see table  [ tbl-1 ] for details .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner .",
    "the search for shells was performed using two different techniques .",
    "first , a psf was generated for each image ( with the routines in daophot ) using , whenever possible , stars of comparable brightness to the nova .",
    "the psf was then subtracted from each star in the image , and the resultant image examined for evidence of extended emission ( i.e. residual flux ) around both the nova and nearby stars ( as a control sample ) . in almost every case ,",
    "this technique was definitive .",
    "the second method was to perform a radial profile fit of the nova and several stars of comparable magnitude .",
    "the fits were compared to determine if the nova had a broader profile .",
    "when a shell was detected , a contour plot was generated from which the size of the shell was measured by determining the edge of the shell ( i.e. where the shell merged into the sky ) .    for shell sizes obtained from the literature ,",
    "we note in table  [ tbl-2 ] the measurement technique ( direct image or radial profile ) used .",
    "radial profiles were quoted for only four objects . in two cases ( rw  umi and v351  pup ) ,",
    "the two techniques yielded consistent answers , while in the remaining two cases ( pw  vul and qu  vul ) , the radial profile values were considerably smaller than the direct image values .",
    "to maintain as consistent a dataset as possible , these discrepant radial profile values were not used in our analysis .",
    "we have detected shells around 10 objects , and in table  [ tbl-2 ] we present the measured diameters from our data , as well as summarize the previous measurements from the literature .",
    "we have obtained data on another 5 objects in which we fail to detect a shell , but for which a shell has been reported in the literature or can be seen in wfpc2 data . since different measurement techniques can produce different results , we include in the table a code indicating the measurement technique used ( radial profile fit or direct image ) ; @xmath13 of the measurements are from direct images where the shell is clearly resolved . for the radial profile",
    "fits , a correction for the psf has been made , while for the direct images , not such correction was made .",
    "we have not corrected our measurements of direct images for geometric effects caused by the ellipticity of the shell ( see below ) .    in the following sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we present the results of our new observations ( shell sizes , expansion rates ) , and derive distances and luminosities ; we include the supporting data necessary for these derivations ( i.e. interstellar extinction , light curve parameters ) .",
    "nebular expansion parallaxes are a fundamental method for determining the distances to novae if the three basic parameters  age , expansion velocity , and size  can be properly determined .",
    "while age can ( usually ) be determined accurately , size ( geometry ) and expansion velocity are less certain , and will dominate the uncertainty in the derived distance . to derive a luminosity",
    "furthermore requires an accurate light curve and a trustworthy reddening estimate .",
    "projected nova shells sometimes appear spherically symmetric , but in many cases are oval .",
    "furthermore , the densest gas clouds are often concentrated in a ring , which is inclined to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "thus , projection effects should be taken into account ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is general agreement that if nova shells are non - spherical , they are prolate ellipsoids . from the shells of the slow novae t aur , dq her ,",
    "bt mon , rr pic , and fh ser , whose inclinations can be estimated with some confidence , an average ellipticity @xmath14 is deduced ; if major diameters , or some average diameters are used ( as in our diameter and radial profile data ) , errors should on the average be within 10% of the true distance .",
    "other novae like gk per or v603 aql tend to have more spherical shells , or at least ` condensations ' arranged in a circular pattern .",
    "radial velocities show a very large dispersion , not only in the different `` spectral systems '' ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but also for a given system .",
    "if a p cygni line profile is observed soon after outburst , the radial velocity of the absorption line is strongly influenced by the superimposed emission , but such radial velocities are the only information available for some objects . in the nebular stage , `` castellated '' emission line profiles are observed .",
    "they have broad wings that generally disappear at later phases .",
    "direct images of nova shells often show the associated condensations ( rings or blobs ) , surrounded by a faint fuzz , which originates in faster moving material ( as seen , e.g , deep images of nova shells in @xcite ) . for several objects in our survey ,",
    "bright condensations are still close to the star and are easily resolved on hst images , while more extended faint fuzz shows up on images taken with earthbound telescopes .",
    "ideally , one should be able to associate maxima of emission lines with given condensations in the shell , i.e. one should have a clear idea about the geometry of the shell .",
    "however , the clumps most easily seen on direct images are those moving at right angles to the line of sight , and do not contribute to the width or `` castellation '' of the emission line . in most cases ,",
    "spatial information of shell spectra , which is essential for reconstructing the shell geometry , is missing .",
    "if there was no deceleration of the expanding shell , then measurements at any age would suffice for an accurate distance measurement .",
    "however , depending on the neighboring environment , nova shells could suffer from deceleration .",
    "@xcite presented a method to approximate the temporal variation of the shell radius , which can be applied if observations at many epochs are available .",
    "as only hr  del and v603  aql have sufficient data for a deceleration determination , we have derived distances to all objects assuming no deceleration . our estimates are given in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "the information needed to determine the absolute magnitude at maximum @xmath15 or 15 days after maximum @xmath16 , which is essential for the use of a nova as a `` standard candle '' , is :    \\1 . a trustworthy apparent magnitude at maximum ( either a photoelectric @xmath17 , @xmath18 , visual ( @xmath19 ) or photographic ( pg ) magnitude ) , as well as a well - defined light curve . in all cases ,",
    "original sources have been re - examined , and light curve parameters have been re - determined , rather than taken from data collections like @xcite .",
    "we prefer photoelectric @xmath18 magnitudes over visual @xmath19 magnitudes , and only quote photographic ( pg ) magnitudes if no other ones are available .",
    "the value of the interstellar reddening can be derived with sufficient accuracy from multi - wavelength observations of objects in decline ( e.g. from emission line ratios or the strength of the 2200     band ) , or from uv observations of old novae ( strength of the 2200    band ) . in cases where no such information was available ,",
    "@xmath20 was determined by the help of the galactic extinction program of @xcite , which interpolates and averages data based on various studies of galactic extinction .    in addition",
    ", the determination of the absolute magnitude of postnovae requires a reliable magnitude in the minimum stage .",
    "we took @xmath18-magnitudes from our survey , as well as from @xcite and a forthcoming statistical study of postnova luminosities @xcite .",
    "in the following , absolute magnitudes of novae at maximum light are usually given only with an accuracy of @xmath21 , and at minimum with an accuracy of @xmath22 .",
    "calculations were often done with higher accuracy , and when corrections ( photographic to visual magnitudes , effects of accretion disc inclination ) were applied , the result was rounded to the same accuracy .",
    "cp  pup was a fast nova that reached a maximum of @xmath23 in november  1942 .",
    "visual and photographic light curves were published by @xcite and @xcite , from which we derive @xmath4 = 6 , @xmath24 days ( averaged over the visual and photographic curves ) , and @xmath25 , where @xmath4 is the time for a nova to decline 2 magnitudes from maximum , @xmath5 is the time to decline by 3 magnitudes , and @xmath6 is the magnitude 15 days after maximum .    the first reported detection of a shell was by zwicky ( see @xcite ) , who noted a diameter of @xmath26 in 1955 in red light .",
    "@xcite observed the shell in 1980 ( h@xmath0/[n  ii ] ) and found a diameter of 14 , while @xcite found the same shell size ( h@xmath0/[n  ii ] ) in 1981 .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a diameter of 20  ( h@xmath0/[n  ii ] ) in 1995 .",
    "a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "image , obtained with the wfpc2 and f656n ( h@xmath0 ) filter in 1995 ( program 6060 ) , shows the stellar remnant surrounded by a circle of bright knots of diameter @xmath27 ; the average surface brightness in the shell is @xmath28 .",
    "our h@xmath0 image ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) reveals about 11 blobs arranged in a circular shell @xmath29  in diameter ( average surface brightness is @xmath30 ) .",
    "the same arrangement is seen in our [ o  iii ] data ( average surface brightness of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the clumpiness seen in the 1980 and 1995 frames is still present .",
    "the expansion velocity ( @xmath32 ) for cp  pup has been determined by @xcite and @xcite , who derived a value of 1500  km / s shortly after outburst .",
    "spectra in the nebular stage @xcite show a profile consisting of 11 emission components , with a velocity spread between @xmath33 and + 570  km / s .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite ( @xmath34 and + 590  km / s ) .",
    "spectroscopy of the resolved blobs in the shell seen in the ground - based images yields a similar range in velocities @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a @xmath35 km / s , based on gratton s result .",
    "previous distances estimates ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) place cp  pup at distances of 1.5 , 1.6 and @xmath36  kpc , respectively , while @xcite give 0.85  kpc , by neglecting the shell geometry and assuming a much smaller expansion velocity .",
    "since this is a well - observed object , we will illustrate the uncertainties in the expansion rate that directly enters into the distance determination .",
    "we compare the ground - based deep h@xmath0 frame , obtained with the eso / mpia 2.2 m telescope in 1987 @xcite , the snapshot hst image of 1995 , and our h@xmath0 frame , obtained 1998 with the eso / dutch 0.92 m telescope .",
    "the expansion rate derived from the centers of the blobs that are arranged in the circular shell is 0.151 , 0.153 and 0.151 arcsec / year , respectively . in spite of the fact that the limiting magnitude and the seeing effects are very different for the three frames , the results are in good agreement .",
    "if the size outlined by the outer edges of the blobs is used , the expansion rates are 0.193 , 0.187 , and 0.178 ; furthermore , the 1987 image reaches to fainter surface magnitudes , and the extent of the `` faint fuzz '' leads to an expansion rate of @xmath37/yr .",
    "the hst exposure reveals that instead of eleven blobs , the shell consists of about 30 blobs with typical diameters of @xmath38 ( some are more extended and show special shapes ) the image also shows a symmetry axis that goes through several blobs which may be interpreted as `` polar blobs '' , while the remainder form an ring that is fragmented into @xmath39 20 single clouds .",
    "if the ring is circular , its ellipticity indicates an inclination of @xmath40 , and the blob - ring structure would form a prolate ellipsoid with @xmath41 .",
    "correspondingly , the radial velocities observed in high - resolution spectra a few years after outburst , assumed to form principally in the fragments of the ring , must be corrected for inclination .",
    "thus , while the measured radial velocity is @xmath42 km / s , the true @xmath43 km / s , and the distance , derived form the expansion rate of the blob centers ( along the major axis ) , is 1140 pc .",
    "if this distance and the expansion rate of the faint fuzz are used to calculate the radial velocity of the `` fast material '' , a value of 1415 km / s is derived , which is similar to that observed in the absorption lines in the spectrum of the nova observed shortly after maximum .",
    "such a dichotomy of fast and slow moving material , forming shells of different diameters , also occurs in pw vul , qu vul , v842 cen and v1974 cyg ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite derived an @xmath44 value of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the absolute magnitude at maximum is @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the absolute magnitude at minimum is @xmath48 .    summing up ,",
    "if the true expansion velocity is known , the use of `` outer edges '' would decrease the distance by 20% , the neglect of the inclination angle would decrease the distance by 32% , and a `` wrong '' expansion velocity of 1400 - 1500 km / s would increase the distance by @xmath49 . if these errors are taken to be typical ones , luminosities of objects for which details on shell structure and extent , inclination and radial velocity are not known , may suffer errors of up to @xmath50 .",

    "we have assumed @xmath469 .",
    "table  [ tbl-5 ] also give the spectroscopic types of novae according to the classification of @xcite ( he / n , fe ii , and `` hybrid '' objects marked as fe / he / n ) , the light curve types ( a , ao , b , c , d ) , as defined by @xcite , and mentions , for some recent objects , whether an object is a onemg nova .    the mmrd relations are shown in figures  [ fig15 ] , [ fig16 ] , and [ fig17 ] . most of the fast , bright objects with smooth `` a - type '' light curves are he / n novae or hybrid objects , i.e. fe ii novae that evolve into he / n novae .",
    "the three fastest pure fe ii novae are v476 cyg , dk lac and v351 pup ; they also show type a light curves , but their @xmath5 times are between 15 and 30 days , larger than those of he / n or hybrid novae ( @xmath470 days ) .",
    "there appears to be no luminosity difference between the he / n novae and the fe ii novae , the only possible feature seems to be the relative faintness of the ` hybrid ' objects relative to the ` pure ' ones .",
    "all novae with structured light curves ( types b , c , d ) have @xmath471 days , and they are , likely without exception , fe ii novae .",
    "the onemg novae are thought to originate on massive white dwarfs , although their luminosities appear to be consistent than the other novae of a comparable rate of decline .",
    "the three objects in our diagram show light curve types a or b , and their @xmath5 times lie between 25 and 50 days .",
    "if one sticks to the `` classical '' mmrd relations which hold for the ensemble of points , the following statements can be made :    using the @xmath5 time as the lightcurve parameter , the relation appears almost linear , @xmath472 a similar relation results when using the @xmath4 time as the lightcurve parameter : @xmath473 in both cases , the residual for a single object is about @xmath474 , and a linear equation appears to be a good fit to the data .",
    "the most recent fit of this type is by @xcite : @xmath475 who , after selecting a `` high quality sample '' and correcting the other novae accordingly , was able to reduce the dispersion to @xmath476 .",
    "it should be noted that a restriction on a near , less reddened sample , or a correction of absolute magnitudes at maximum by assuming that @xmath477 for all objects , as done by cohen , does not lead to a decisive improvement of the scatter in our data set , and thus we refrain from any correction which may introduce systematic effects . at an average @xmath478 days ,",
    "cohen s calibration is @xmath479 fainter than ours .",
    "another classical relation uses a specific stretched s - shaped curve , which is apparent in samples of extragalactic novae .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite , and was recently revised by @xcite .",
    "we have adopted their turn - over point , but have re - determined the zero - point and the amplitude : @xmath480 our zero - point is almost identical to that of @xcite , but the `` contrast '' between bright and faint novae has increased from @xmath481 to @xmath482 .",
    "a possible explanation is that in the extragalactic sample of @xcite , very bright and fast novae of the v1500 cyg and cp pup - type appear fainter because of insufficient sampling time , and the faintest among the slow novae are missed ( malmquist bias ) .",
    "finally , it was shown by @xcite that the absolute ( pg ) magnitude 15 days after outburst is similar for novae of all speed classes .",
    "@xcite derived for 11 objects @xmath483 , while we obtain for 28 objects : @xmath484 indicating a similar zero - point difference ( @xmath485 ) between cohen s and our sample .",
    "a regression shows that there is absolutely no trend in @xmath252 versus , e.g. , @xmath5-time , however , the standard deviation ( @xmath486 ) is quite large .",
    "there is one more way to look at the mmrd relation , if one takes the light curve type as a second parameter .",
    "the dichotomy between the a / ao `` super - eddington '' and bcd `` eddington '' groups , introduced in the investigation by @xcite , appears well expressed .",
    "the ( @xmath487 ) diagram can be divided in two fields : the a / ao group has @xmath488 and @xmath489 , the bcd group has @xmath490 and @xmath491 ( two poorly investigated objects , v500 aql and xx tau , may have poorly determined luminosities and/or decline times , and are not considered in the following discussion ) . in the ( @xmath492 ) diagram ,",
    "the two groups are separated as well ; the dividing line in time is now at @xmath493 .",
    "if one examines the `` super - eddington '' and `` eddington '' groups separately , mmrd relations are quite weakly expressed ; in the @xmath492 diagram , the a / ao group follows the relation @xmath494 with a correlation coefficient of 0.61 .",
    "the bcd group shows only a weak correlation coefficient of 0.21 between magnitude and decline time ; @xmath495 .",
    "a linear relation for these objects is : @xmath496    in the @xmath487 diagram , the a / ao group follows the relation @xmath497 with a correlation coefficient of 0.45 , and the bcd group yields @xmath498 with a correlation coefficient of 0.46 ( of course , the @xmath499 is the same ) .",
    "such a type of fit in two separate regions mimics the stretched s - shaped curve used for a fit of the complete sample , but in the present case we have a criterion ( the light curve form ) to separate two regions , and to use different linear relations ( or simple averages ) in them .",
    "the overall scatter in the mmrd relation  which is of the order of @xmath500 in all these relations  may indicate the presence of hidden second order parameters ( spectroscopic type , light curve type , mass of underlying white dwarf  ) which should influence the luminosity .",
    "however , the individual errors are too large , so the sample is not able to indicate which parameter is most decisive .",
    "thus , the mmrd relation can be used as a reliable distance indicator only in a statistical way ; for a single object , the absolute magnitude can be off by @xmath501 .",
    "if samples are taken from different stellar populations , systematic luminosity differences may be present .",
    "this does not devaluate the use of novae as distance indicators , it simply means that caution must be used when such relations are applied ( similar problems occur in other distance indicators like supernovae , cepheids , and rr lyrae stars ) . a better understanding of the mmrd relation is also the basis of a better understanding of the physics of nova eruptions .",
    "another result of our study is the derivation of absolute magnitudes of classical novae after eruption .",
    "table [ tbl-6 ] lists the absolute visual magnitudes of novae , which have settled to a more or less constant minimum brightness .",
    "some of the objects have known orbital periods and inclination angles ; relevant data were taken from the catalog of @xcite , and these magnitudes @xmath502 were corrected for inclination effects , using the formula given by @xcite ; the corrected magnitudes @xmath503 are also listed .",
    "all novae for which no inclination information was available , were corrected by assuming an average inclination @xmath504 .",
    "recent results on orbital periods are available for v500 aql @xcite and v446  her and v533  her @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nova data , absolute magnitudes of dwarf novae at maximum , based on hst fgs parallaxes , and of novalike stars , mainly based on hipparcos parallaxes , were derived ( the absolute magnitudes supersede those given by @xcite ) .",
    "results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] . if one discards novae in or below the period gap ( cp pup , rw umi , qu vul ) and the long - period system gk per , as well as the peculiar novalike ae aqr , the remaining systems ( with @xmath505 < -0.4 $ ] ) indicate a dependence of absolute magnitude on period : @xmath506\\ ] ] ( correlation coefficient 0.47 ) .",
    "if the period ( in hours ) is used , the relation is @xmath507\\ ] ] which , at @xmath508 hours , yields absolute magnitudes which are @xmath509 brighter than those predicted @xcite s formula for dwarf novae at maximum .    summing up",
    ", no obvious separation of absolute magnitudes of objects belonging to different groups ( novae at minimum , dwarf novae at outburst , and novalike systems at normal light ) can be seen .",
    "this again shows the intimate connection of these groups , which is also obvious from space density considerations , and the hibernation scenario , which indicates that only by including novalike stars and dwarf novae to the space densities of novae , realistic recurrence times of novae can be obtained @xcite .",
    "we have obtained optical imaging of 30 recent novae , and have detected shells , in combination with _ hubble space telescope _",
    "data , for 14 objects .",
    "we fail to detect the previously observed shell around rw  umi , while pw  vul , v1974  cyg , and v842  cen appear to show two distinct shells .",
    "expansion parallaxes for the novae have been derived , and combined with revised distances for other novae , have been used to derive absolute magnitudes .",
    "a study of various maximum magnitude - rate of decline relations is in general agreement with previous `` linear '' determinations .",
    "however , a relation making use of the light curve type may yield a somewhat better fit to the data .",
    "it clearly shows the existence of two types of novae : ( 1 ) the fast ( @xmath510 days ) super - eddington novae , which may be he / n , `` hybrid '' fe ii novae , and , if their evolution is somewhat slower , fe ii novae .",
    "they all show smooth light curves with well - defined maxima ( a ) , and some of them may show quasi - periodic light oscillations in their later evolution ( ao ) .",
    "( 2 ) the slow @xmath511 days ) eddington - novae with structured light curves ( ba ) , double maxima ( bb ) , standstills at maximum ( ca ) , dust formations at later stages ( ca , cb ) , and long premaximum stages ( d ) , seem to belong exclusively to the fe ii spectroscopic type .",
    "the merging of both groups leads to a well - expressed mmrd ; if both groups are considered separately , their mmrds show smaller slopes , and a jump of @xmath512 occurs at @xmath513 days and @xmath514 days . at minimum ,",
