    "the analysis of the trends of abundances of light elements with respect to [ fe / h ] for the oldest metal - poor stars is a direct way to provide some clues on their production mechanism and evolution .    in a recent work on non - lte effects in iron abundances ,",
    "thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) ( ti99 ) obtained that for metal - poor dwarf stars fe abundances ( [ fe / h ] ) are affected by significant non - lte effects and , moreover , surface gravities ( logg ) derived by lte analysis also need corrections .",
    "this logg corrections should be crucial for beryllium abundances determination , since be ii resonance lines normally used to estimate be abundances are much sensitive to this stellar parameter .    in this work",
    "we examine the consequences of non - lte corrections to logg and [ fe / h ] for logn(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] ( or be - fe ) diagram . in section 2",
    "we present a short summary of our results obtained in ti99 for fe and in section 3 the results for be abundances .",
    "ti99 performed statistical equilibrium calculations for fe i and fe ii to estimate non - lte effects in iron abundances .",
    "the main results are showed in figure 1 ( see ti99 for details ) .",
    "we re - estimate n(be / h ) abundances for 21 stars also analised by boesgaard et al.(1999 ) using @xmath0 , logg and [ fe / h ] given by ti99 .",
    "be abundances were calculated assuming lte conditions , since the non - lte corrections are negligible for be ii lines considered here ( @xmath1 3130 and 3131 ) , as demonstrated by garcia lopez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , for example .",
    "figure 2 shows our results .",
    "we conclude that for the range of metal - poor objects -3 @xmath2 [ fe / h ] @xmath2 -1.5 , non - lte corrections for [ fe / h ] compensate changes in be abundances ( as result of logg corrections ) in the be - fe diagram , recovering the same linear behavior of lte derived abundances ( boesgaard et al.1999 ) .",
    "similar results are found for boron ( see primas 1999 , this colloquium ) .",
