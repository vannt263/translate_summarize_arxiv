    "iron - selenide shows a number of polymorphs including a low - temperature tetragonal ( @xmath7 ) phase , the so - called anti - pbo - type fese  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-fe@xmath8se@xmath9 compound is currently an interesting phase and has been studied experimentally for its spintronics related magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "the perfectly stoichiometric @xmath7-fese has been shown to be non - ferromagnetic , but non - stoichiometric @xmath7-fese demonstrates ferromagnetism that was attributed to defects or fe clusters in @xmath7-fese thin films  @xcite .",
    "zinc blende - type fese was shown to be an antiferromagnetic metal  @xcite .",
    "recently , superconductivity with a @xmath10k was also discovered in @xmath7-fese and was attributed to se vacancies  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite performed first - principles calculations and their results indicated that electron - phonon coupling can not explain the superconductivity of @xmath7-fese which shows spin - density wave ( sdw ) . zhang _",

    "@xcite showed that excess fe in fete provides electron and the excess fe is strongly magnetic .",
    "motivated not only by the observed magnetism and superconductivity in @xmath7-fese , but also by our recent extensive calculations of fese  @xcite , where we considered different crystal structures of fese and ( i ) a phase transition from @xmath7-fese to cscl - type fese was found and ( ii ) cscl - type fese was the only structure that survived in a compressed unit cell and retained its magnetism .",
    "the tetragonal @xmath7-fese structure with coordination number four can be thought of as the cscl structure with an elongated @xmath11 axis and coordination number of eight .",
    "since ordered cscl - type systems have no nearest neighbor atoms of the same kind , in order to understand the properties of such compounds containing magnetically active constituents , it is necessary to consider magnetic unit cells large enough to allow for antiferromagnetism .    here",
    ", we investigate the magnetism of cscl - type fese .",
    "we find that cscl - type fese demonstrates both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism over a wide range of lattice constants in terms of density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite by using the total - energy all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw )  @xcite calculations implemented in the qmd - flapw software package  @xcite .",
    "both the local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite were considered for the exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "integrations inside the brillouin zone ( bz ) were performed using the improved tetrahedron method  @xcite over a @xmath12 mesh within the three dimensional ( 3d ) bz , corresponding to @xmath13*k * points inside the irreducible wedge of the 3d - bz .",
    "an energy cutoff at @xmath14@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lattice constant , was employed for the linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) basis set , which corresponds to @xmath17lapws per * k*-point and spin .",
    "a @xmath18@xmath15 star function cutoff was used for depicting the charge density and potential in the interstitial regions .",
    "lattice harmonics with @xmath19 were employed to expand the charge density , potential , and wave - functions inside each muffin - tin ( mt ) sphere of radius @xmath20a.u .",
    "for fe and @xmath21a.u . for se",
    ". note that those computational parameters satisfy the convergence test  @xcite .",
    "all core electrons were treated fully relativistically and valence states were calculated scalar relativistically , _",
    "i.e. _ , without spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "the explicit orthogonalization ( xo ) scheme was employed to ensure the orthogonality between the core and valence states  @xcite . for spin - orbit coupling on valence states , we employed the second variation method  @xcite with the spin diagonal parts of the density subjected to a self - consistency loop . during the second variation procedure ,",
    "integrations inside the 3d - bz were done in the full - bz , _",
    "i.e. _ , with 1688*k * points .",
    "self - consistency was assumed when the difference between input and output charge densities became less than @xmath22electrons / a.u.@xmath23",
    "because the lsda and gga results agree qualitatively with each other , we will keep our discussion based on the gga results ; the lsda results will be given where they are required .",
    "the total energies were calculated for the nonmagnetic ( nm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) states using the conventional unit cell of two atoms .",
    "figure  [ structure ] shows the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling of fe in different planes and four types of afm structures , afm - i , afm - ii , afm - iii , and afm - iv , were considered and tetragonally doubled unit cells were used for the afm calculations .",
    "the main difference among these afm structures is not only the afm coupling between the fe atoms in different planes , but also antiferromagnetically coupled coordination number(@xmath24 ) in the unit cell _",
    "e.g. _ , the afm - i , afm - ii , afm - iii , and afm - iv states have two , four , six , and four antiferromagnetically coupled atoms , respectively .",
    "furthermore , afm - ii and afm - iv have the same coordination number , but the coupling between the fe atoms is different when viewd in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "note that all these afm structures are similar to the feas - based superconductor  @xcite .",
    "the calculated total energy energy curve shown in fig .  [ tefig ] demonstrates that the afm - i state is the ground state of cscl - type fese .",
    "the calculated total energies per fe atom are shown relative to the equilibrium energy of the afm - i state .",
    "the total energy difference between the fm and afm states is sensitive to the unit cell volume change . since the afm - ii",
    ", afm - iii , and afm - iv states are higher in energy than the fm and afm - i states , we denote for brevity hereafter the afm - i state as the afm state . the calculated equilibrium lattice constants for the nm , fm , and afm states are summarized in table  [ table - a ] .",
    "calculations were also carried out for the optimization of the @xmath26 ratio of the afm structure , and the optimized @xmath26 was found to be @xmath27 .",
    ".calculated properties of cscl - type fese ; @xmath16 is the equilibrium lattice constant in  units , @xmath28 is the local magnetic moment of fe in @xmath29 units , and @xmath30 gives the relative stability of the fm , afm - ii , and nm phases with respect to the afm - i phase equilibrium in units of mev / fe atom , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath31 means that the afm - i phase is more stable than the fm , afm - ii , and nm phases .",
    "results are given for lsda and gga . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the lattice constant over which the fm state becomes stable is close to that of fm bcc fe , @xmath32 , which has been grown on gaas  @xcite and znse  @xcite substrates due to the good lattice match between them .",
    "therefore , it can also raise the possibility of growing cscl - type fese on gaas or znse , because the calculated lattice parameter of fese is very close to that of gaas ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the formation energy of cscl - type fese at ambient pressure is @xmath34ev / f.u .",
    "@xcite , which indicates that cscl - type fese is in a metastable state and there might be a possibility to achieve this structure either at high pressure or grown as a thin film .",
    "recently , fes , which is isoelectronic to fese , indeed showed cscl structure at high pressure  @xcite .",
    "several other metastable materials have been grown successfully  @xcite using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , which is a non - equilibrium process .",
    "in summary , we predict , based on density functional theory by using the total - energy all - electron flapw method , a new phase of fese , the fm and afm state of cscl - type fese .",
    "the calculated total energy curves indicate that the afm state is most stable with the largest lattice constant .",
    "in addition , the energy barrier for the afm to fm transition can be overcome by volume contraction .",
    "we found a spin - density - reflection symmetry driven first - order phase transition in cscl - type fese , as seen previously in the spin - density - inversion symmetry driven phase transition in gacmn@xmath35  @xcite .",
    "the calculated ldos and spin - density contour plots revealed the origin of the magnetic phase transitions in cscl - type fese .",
    "we also predict that cscl - type fese is mechanically stable for all the magnetic states considered in this work .",
