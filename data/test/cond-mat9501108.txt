    "this model has been the subject of several studies in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the existence of a variety of phases has been demonstrated .",
    "the complete characterization of these phases and of the phase transitions between them is , however , not yet entirely solved .",
    "for @xmath3 the semiclassical approximation gives a rather good description of the ground state @xcite .",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram obtained in this way is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](a ) .",
    "it consists of four different phases .",
    "the usual ferromagnetic ( @xmath4 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath5 ) phases are separated on both sides by rather exotic phases , where _ collinear _ or _ orthogonal nematic _ ordering appears . in all phases",
    "the original @xmath6 symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken .",
    "the order can be characterized by different long range order parameters . in the nematic phases , e.g. , the expectation value of the spin operators vanishes , @xmath7",
    "while some of the quadrupole operators have finite expectation values with @xmath8    quantum effects , that appear most strongly in one dimension ( 1d ) , can drastically modify this phase diagram .",
    "theorem @xcite ( the quantum analog of the mermin - wagner theorem ) states that , unless the order parameter is a conserved quantity , quantum fluctuations will restore the continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this means that apart from the ferromagnetic state , whose domain of stability is the same in the classical and quantum calculations , in 1d the ground state of the model in eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) should be disordered for any other value of @xmath2 . within this quantum disordered regime",
    ", however , there could still be several phases .",
    "the semiclassical phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](a ) should therefore be replaced by a rather different _",
    "quantum _ phase diagram .",
    "the quantum analog of the classical nel state is the haldane phase @xcite , where dynamic mass generation leads to a unique disordered ground state with hidden order @xcite .",
    "there is a finite gap ( haldane gap ) to the excitations .",
    "this phase is thought to exist in the region @xmath9 .",
    "the orthogonal nematic phase in @xmath10 is replaced by a tripled periodic phase .",
    "there are strong numerical indications @xcite that this phase is critical due to three soft modes at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as is the case in the integrable lai - sutherland @xcite model corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "far less understood is the behavior on the other side of the ferromagnetic regime . in a recent series of papers chubukov @xcite has shown by using perturbational calculation on a specially chosen `` vacuum '' state with nematic long range order and by applying the standard renormalization group method , that in 1d in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic instability point quantum fluctuations restore the @xmath6 symmetry , the ground state remains unique , and the interaction between the goldstone bosons leads to dynamic mass generation .",
    "the opening of the gap is exponentially slow as @xmath2 departs from @xmath14 .",
    "chubukov @xcite has emphasized that this disordered phase is different from the haldane phase .",
    "in fact , the two phases are separated by a dimerized phase in which translational invariance is broken .",
    "this dimerized phase is believed to exist for @xmath15 .",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance leads to a pair of singlet ground states and a finite excitation gap above it .",
    "this behavior has been proven rigorously at @xmath16 , where the system is again integrable and hence the spectrum can be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "the value of the gap at this point is 0.173178 , a rather small value , while the correlation length is large , about 21 lattice units @xcite .",
    "this explains the early numerical difficulties in identifying this phase @xcite .    as a further support for the existence of the new disordered phase chubukov",
    "@xcite has pointed out that at @xmath17 , where the ferromagnetic state becomes unstable , the magnon spectrum has no soft mode at @xmath18 .",
    "neither is there any interesting feature at @xmath18 in the spectrum of bound states of two , three , etc . ,",
    "there does not seem to exist any mode that could drive a direct transition from the ferromagnet into a dimerized state .",
    "in fact , his study of the effect of quantum fluctuations on the dimerized state , using appropriate bosonization , led him to conclude that the stability region of the dimerized phase is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , thus the disordered phase could exist in the range @xmath21 .    in what follows this hypothesized phase",
    "will be referred to as the _ nondimerized quantum nematic _ or _",
    "chubukov s phase_. the phase diagram expected to be valid in the 1d case is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](b ) .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to find numerical evidence for the possible existence of chubukov s phase .",
    "for this purpose we studied finite spin chains for various values of @xmath2 . beside the usual lnczos diagonalization method , which allowed us to study chains up to @xmath22 sites with periodic boundary condition",
    ", we used white s density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) @xcite with open boundary condition up to @xmath23 .",
    "the data were analyzed by finite - size scaling techniques .    since chubukov s proposed phase",
    "is supposed to have a nondegenerate singlet ground state and unbroken translational symmetry , the transition to this phase from the dimerized phase can be located either by studying the ground state degeneracy , the appearance of soft modes at the transition point , or the behaviour of the dimerization order parameter .",
    "our results for these quantities will be presented subsequently in the next three sections .",
    "section v. contains some concluding remarks .",
    "one possibility to see the difference between the dimerized and the nondimerized quantum nematic phases would be to study the degeneracy of the infinite volume ground state .    for a finite system with even number of sites @xmath24",
    "the ground state is unique for any @xmath25 ; it is an @xmath26 spin singlet state .",
    "if periodic boundary condition is used , this state has momentum @xmath11 . in the dimerized phase",
    "there has to be another singlet state with momentum @xmath27 with an energy , which , for long enough chains , is exponentially close to the ground - state energy",
    ". this should not be the case , however , for the nondimerized quantum nematic phase , where the ground state is expected to be nondegenerate , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus a gap has to be opened between the lowest singlet @xmath11 and @xmath27 states .",
    "therefore , we first studied the finite - size scaling behaviour of this gap .",
    "the gaps were calculated by the lnczos diagonalization method for chains with @xmath28 sites .",
    "it is worth pointing out why we could not use the dmrg method to study this degeneracy problem , although it would have allowed us to consider much longer chains .",
    "exactly at the point @xmath14 the model has an extra @xmath29 symmetry and the hamiltonian can be written as a ( negative ) sum of permutation operators .",
    "any totally symmetric state is a ground state .",
    "the ground - state sector is highly degenerate and belongs to the @xmath30 symmetric representation of @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that for any finite even chain length @xmath24 the ground - state sector consists of the @xmath31 spin multiplets , each once . away from @xmath14",
    "this degeneracy is lifted , the spin singlet becomes the ground state for @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the interesting range of @xmath2 the other states remain still rather close in energy . for chains with @xmath23 sites",
    "many of them lie still lower than the relevant lowest @xmath27 level .",
    "they could be separated by looking at their momentum , since we are interested in a @xmath27 level , while the others have momentum @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately the dmrg method does not allow to work in a definite momentum sector , and too many levels would have to be considered .",
    "therefore , using this method , the interesting gap can not be computed with a reasonable precision .    the scaled gaps for various chain lengths , ie .",
    "the gaps multiplied by the number of bonds in the chain are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbc ] .",
    "close to the point @xmath33 the scaled gap increases monotonically with increasing chain length , while further away it decreases . in a critical model",
    "the scaled gap should asymptotically be independent of the chain length .",
    "therefore , according to the standard procedure the transition point @xmath34 could be located by looking at the crossing points between curves belonging to chain lengths @xmath24 and @xmath35 .",
    "they are marked by arrows and also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : pbc ] . as the chain length increases , the crossing points scale towards the ferromagnetic transition point .",
    "in fact , as the inset shows , the points fit well to a straight line on the @xmath36 scale , giving @xmath37 .",
    "this would mean that the gap vanishes everywhere above @xmath14 and chubukov s phase does not exist .    due to the limitations of the numerical calculations we can not exclude the possibility that the crossing points converge to a @xmath38 .",
    "however , the @xmath2 range where the quantum nematic phase exists , must then be very narrow with @xmath39 .",
    "according to chubukov s proposal the transition at @xmath34 between the nondimerized quantum nematic and the dimerized phases belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "the lifting of the twofold degeneracy should be accompanied by the appearance of a soft mode and the vanishing of the gap .",
    "therefore we have studied the behavior of the gap between the ground state and the lowest excited state . in the whole interesting region of @xmath2 this lowest excited state was found to have total spin @xmath40 .    for the calculation of this gap the abovementioned objection does not hold , and we could apply the dmrg method . following the usual procedure ,",
    "the open boundary condition was used , since it gives much better results than the periodic one .",
    "now the ground state is expected to be unique even in the dimerized phase , if the number of sites @xmath24 is even .",
    "this is easily understood by comparing the two dimerized valence - bond configurations , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerconf ] , which are believed to be good variational states in the dimerized region . since the bond - strength oscillates in a dimerized state , clearly the configuration which has low - energy bonds at the ends has lower energy than the other one with high - energy bonds at the ends .",
    "( for odd @xmath24 the two simple dimerized configurations would have the same energy , therefore they resonate and the real ground state is a state which has low - energy bonds at both ends and a moving `` domain wall '' somewhere in - between @xcite . in this case",
    "the ground state can not be considered as a real vacuum , since it contains already one quasi - particle .",
    "this fact would make it extremely difficult to draw conclusions from results on chains with odd @xmath24 , therefore we have not studied such chains . )",
    "the longest chain we could reasonably study had @xmath23 sites . the computed value of the gap is believed to be precise to at least five digits , when the maximum number of block states kept during the renormalization was @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : beta ] shows the scaled value of the gap from the ground state to the lowest @xmath40 state in the @xmath42 interval .",
    "this gap vanishes exactly even in finite systems at @xmath33 due to the extra @xmath29 symmetry , and is extremely small near this point . above @xmath14 , however , the scaled gap increases , indicating the opening of the mass gap in the whole studied interval . in order to analyze quantitatively the opening of this singlet - quintuplet gap",
    ", we studied the finite lattice approximants of the callan - symanzik @xmath43-function @xcite @xmath44\\over      \\ln ( l_2/l_1 ) { 1\\over 2 } { \\partial\\over\\partial\\theta } \\ln               [ \\delta(\\theta , l_1)\\delta(\\theta , l_2 ) ] } \\;.\\label{beta2}\\ ] ]    @xmath45 depends rather weakly on @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to determine the opening of the gap at the edge of the ferromagnetic regime rather convincingly .",
    "the @xmath43-function increases above @xmath33 with a power law @xmath48 giving a straight line on the log - log plot , like in a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the best fit was obtained with @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the gap opens exponentially as @xmath51\\ ; , \\qquad                  \\theta >",
    "\\theta_{\\rm f}\\;.\\ ] ] this is in agreement with chubukov s result , which suggested an exponentially slow opening of the gap @xcite .",
    "note that although this form resembles that of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , we think that the phase transition here is not really a kt transition but a first order one because the transition from the ferromagnetic to this state is due to the crossing of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 levels , which are the ground states on the two sides , respectively .    for @xmath54 , for the chain lengths we could use , there",
    "did not appear any sign of further level crossings .",
    "we did not find any level that would soften at a @xmath55 , ie .",
    "we did not find any trace of an additional phase transition .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the dmrg method gives precise energies only for those states that are targeted from the very beginning of the iteration .",
    "the procedure can easily miss a level , thus leading to false conclusion , if its energy comes down into the interesting energy range for long system sizes only , and hence it is not targeted at the beginning of the algorithm .",
    "an alternative way to study phase transitions is by analyzing order parameters and correlation functions .",
    "they require the knowledge of the ground - state wave function only .    even though both the dimerized phase and the nondimerized quantum nematic phase are disordered , an order parameter can be defined in the dimerized phase by using the fact that the translational invariance is spontaneously broken .",
    "the dimerization order parameter is usually defined as @xmath56 in ref .",
    "@xcite xian pointed out that for the pure biquadratic model a more proper definition would be the bond - strength oscillation in the ground state . following this suggestion we define the dimerization order parameter as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the local hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hami ] ) , and the expectation value is taken in the ground state of an infinite chain whose ends are subject to open boundary condition .    in case of finite chains ,",
    "let us denote the energy difference of neighboring bonds in the middle of the open chain with length @xmath24 by @xmath59 the ( infinite volume ) dimerization order parameter is then @xmath60    @xmath61 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer ] in the range @xmath62 .",
    "it is finite also for @xmath63 , where no dimerization is expected .",
    "it vanishes at the vbs point @xmath64 @xcite only , where the ground state has a simple form and @xmath65 for all @xmath24 .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath61 can be understood by observing that the bond strength is generally not uniform in an open chain near the ends but alternate between strong and weak bonds , even if in the thermodynamic limit the system is not dimerized @xcite . as we move towards the middle of the chain this",
    "oscillation gradually decreases . in a noncritical model",
    "this decay is exponential . in leading order @xmath61",
    "is expected to vary as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath68 is a kind of a correlation length . when the model has a nondimerized thermodynamic limit , @xmath69 .    in case of critical behavior",
    ", however , @xmath61 scales to zero as a power law , ie.@xmath70 where @xmath71 is a relevant surface exponent .",
    "using this property , a systematic scaling analysis of our data for @xmath61 allows to determine @xmath72 for various values of @xmath2 .    as a first test we computed @xmath61 at @xmath73 , where the exact result for @xmath72 is available . fitting the values of @xmath72 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 of eq .",
    "( [ offcrit ] ) to the last three points , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we got @xmath76 which is quite close to xian s @xcite exact value @xmath77 , when it is properly rescaled according to our definition of @xmath72 .",
    "our value for the correlation length is @xmath78 , which compares well with the exact value for bulk correlation length @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : loglogtb ] and [ fig : loglogdi ] show a log - log plot of @xmath61 vs @xmath24 for various values of @xmath2 near @xmath80 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the transition between the dimerized phase and the haldane phase is easily spotted : for @xmath81 the curves have an upward curvature indicating a finite value for @xmath72 , while for @xmath82 the curvature is in the opposite direction implying @xmath69 . at the critical point , where the asymptotic scaling is expected to be of the form of eq.([crit ] ) , the points should lie on a straight line . from this analysis",
    "we obtain @xmath83 for the transition point , as expected .",
    "in contrast to this behavior , all the curves have a slight upward curvature for @xmath84 , although this curvature is almost zero in the close vicinity of @xmath14 .",
    "this implies a very small but finite dimerization in this region as well .",
    "our results are , however , more uncertain in this region than near @xmath85 . since @xmath61 is small , the relative accuracy of the method is not very satisfactory , even when @xmath41 basis states are kept during the renormalization .",
    "there is also a possibility that we are not yet in the asymptotic regime .",
    "nevertheless , these results seem to indicate that most likely @xmath72 remains finite down to @xmath14 . like the gap",
    ", its value becomes exponentially small near the transition point .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] we present the two - point correlation function @xmath86 for three different values of @xmath2 .",
    "well inside the dimerized region the correlation function alternates in sign strongly .",
    "it is positive for even @xmath87 , and negative for odd @xmath87 . for smaller values of @xmath2 , however , this behavior changes drastically . at @xmath88",
    "already all correlations are found to be negative and this property remains valid down to @xmath14 .",
    "there appears to be no sign of period doubling , just as it was proposed for the nondimerized quantum nematic phase .",
    "although we do not fully understand the reason of this change , we think that the presence of dimerization should not necessarily mean an alternation in the sign of the correlation function , and thus the observed behavior can not be viewed as a direct evidence for the appearance of a nondimerized regime .",
    "in the present paper we studied the ground - state phase diagram of the bilinear - biquadratic spin-1 chain near the ferromagnetic instability , where chubukov proposed the existence of a nondimerized quantum nematic phase .",
    "we considered four independent quantities .",
    "first we looked at the degeneracy of the ground state , ie .",
    "whether the ground state is unique or doubly degenerate .",
    "then we determined the opening of the gap .",
    "finally we studied the behavior of the dimerization order parameter and the ground - state correlation function .",
    "we did not find any real evidence in any of these quantities for the existence of the hypothesized nondimerized quantum nematic phase .",
    "our results are in better agreement with the assumption that the dimerization appears exactly at the point where ferromagnetism becomes unstable , ie .  at @xmath33 .",
    "the gap opening is well described by a kosterlitz - thouless - like form , although the transition is expected to be of first order .",
    "the main difficulty we had to face in our numerical work was the extreme smallness of the gaps and order parameters in the region where the nondimerized quantum nematic phase was proposed to exist . due to the restrictions in the numerical calculations and the uncertainties in the extrapolation procedure , our conclusion can not be definitive .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the phase proposed by chubukov does appear in a very narrow region , say @xmath89 . to resolve this question satisfactorily calculations on even longer chains would be needed .",
