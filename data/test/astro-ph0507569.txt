    ", we use the estimate from zahn ( 1977 , 1989 ) : the synchronization time - scale in terms of the period is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the masses of the giant and white dwarf respectively , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the radius and luminosity of the giant ( all in solar units ) .",
    "the orbital period @xmath51 is measured in days .",
    "the s  type sss are very likely synchronized ( schild et al .",
    "2001 ; schmutz et al .",
    "other proof of this supposition is that most of the sss with derived orbital parameters ( see mikoajewska 2003 ) have orbital eccentricity @xmath520 . because the circularization time of the orbits is @xmath3410 times longer than the synchronization time ( schmutz et al .",
    "1994 and the references therein ) , if a ss s orbit is circularized it will very likely be synchronized too .",
    "a typical dtype ss would have @xmath53 , and white dwarf mass @xmath54 . for a period of 100 days for a typical d-type ss",
    ", we find @xmath55 years .    for the individual systems",
    ", we calculated the synchronization time ( @xmath56 ) for two cases : @xmath56 is derived assuming p@xmath57p@xmath2 , and @xmath58 assuming p@xmath57100 days .",
    "these are given in table  [ dtab2 ] .",
    "depending on the individual parameters , the synchronization time can be from @xmath35100 yr up to @xmath3310@xmath59 yr .",
    "this means that it is possible for a dtype ss to be synchronized if the orbital period is short ( p@xmath60p@xmath61 .",
    "the mass of the mass donors in s  type sss with known parameters are in the range 0.6 - 3.2 @xmath12 ( mikoajewska 2003 ) .",
    "the calculated masses of the mass donors in dtype sss are larger . as can be seen in table  2 , they range from 2.2 up to 6.5 @xmath12 .",
    "masses of 8  m@xmath5 are generally considered the upper limit for evolution to planetary nebula nuclei and white dwarfs , after heavy mass loss , especially during their agb phases .",
    "following our calculations for the mass of the giants ( table  [ dtab2 ] ) and assuming m@xmath62 , the total mass of the binary is about ( m@xmath63m@xmath64 , in agreement with the above upper limit of 8  m@xmath5 for the wd progenitor .",
    "the position of the mass donors on the h - r diagram is presented in fig.[h - r ] , assuming near solar chemical composition and stellar parameters as given in sect.[indiv ] ( see also pereira 2005 ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of shaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have been used .",
    "the donors appeared in a wide mass interval  from 2.5 to @xmath65 .",
    "the derived evolutionary masses are in good agreement with those obtained from r@xmath13 and @xmath66 .",
    "three of them appeared crossing the hertzsprung gap ( hd  330036,v417  cen and as  201 ) , sth@xmath1  190 is situated near the base of the red giant branch , and he  3 - 1591 is already evolving on the red giant branch .",
    "the relevant time for a @xmath67 star to cross the hertzsprung gap is @xmath688@xmath410@xmath69 yr and its life time on the red giant branch is @xmath685@xmath410@xmath69 yr ( iben 1991 ) . for a @xmath70 star these times are 1.5@xmath410@xmath71 yr and 1.57@xmath410@xmath71 yr ( iben 1991 )",
    ". these lifetimes are longer than the calculated @xmath72 and comparable with @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the rotation of the mass donors in dtype sss could be synchronized for these lifetimes .",
    "because the orbital periods of the majority of sss are unknown , an indirect method to obtain p@xmath74 is to measure .",
    "if the mass donors in sss are co - rotating ( p@xmath75p@xmath74 ) , we can find clues for the orbital periods via the simple relation p@xmath74 v@xmath2 = 2@xmath76r@xmath13 , where p@xmath74 is the orbital period , v@xmath2 and r@xmath13 are the rotational velocity and radius of the giant , respectively .",
    "it is very useful in the case of eclipsing binaries , where @xmath77 and @xmath68v@xmath2 .",
    "if the inclination is unknown , we can only obtain an upper limit for p@xmath74 .",
    "using kepler s third law [ @xmath78 , we can calculate the semimajor axis of the systems .",
    "these are given in table  [ dtab2 ] .",
    "the values in the brackets ( for p@xmath2 and @xmath79 ) correspond to the estimation of the upper limit of these parameters , assuming 10% errors in  and r@xmath13 .    up to now , from 188 sss",
    ", the orbital elements and binary periods are well known for @xmath3440 objects only ( and they are all s  type ) .",
    "the orbital periods are in the range 200 - 2000 days ( mikoajewska 2003 ) .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ dtab2 ] , if dtype sss are synchronized , their orbital periods would be relatively short ( 4 - 60 days ) and the distance between the wd and the mass donor would be 2 - 5  r@xmath13 .",
    "the observation of fast rotation of dtype sss raises two further questions : first , what is the evolutionary history of these stars which has produced such high rotation , and second , what does the effect of high rotation have on their mass loss and subsequent dust formation ?",
    "we see three possible reasons for the fast rotation of mass donors in dtype sss :    * ( i ) * the rotation is synchronized with the binary period ( p@xmath75 p@xmath74 ) . in this case",
    "their orbital periods should be short @xmath8050 days .    however , it also could be , that they are not synchronously rotating .",
    "the possibility that p@xmath81 p@xmath74 has to be excluded because the orbital separations would be unreasonably small , and the synchronization time would be extremely short ( they will be synchronized in 30 - 9000 years ; see @xmath56 in table  [ dtab2 ] ) . if p@xmath82 p@xmath74 , reasons for their fast rotation could be :    * ( ii ) * the current giants have been spun - up from the transfer of angular momentum .",
    "jeffries & stevens ( 1996 ) proposed a mechanism in which accretion of a slow massive wind from the agb progenitor of the current white dwarf can transfer sufficient angular momentum .",
    "this also explains the chemical enrichment in s - process elements in d sss , that were present in the agb wind ( see also pereira et al .",
    "mass transfer via l@xmath83 , when the current white dwarf was the mass donor , can also spin - up the companion , as in millisecond radio pulsars ( van den heuvel 1984 ) .    *",
    "( iii ) * planet swallowing to spin up the giant .",
    "rough estimation gives angular momentum transfer during a collision of a planet with mass @xmath84 and velocity @xmath85 to a giant of mass @xmath47 , of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "this causes a change in the giant s rotational velocity @xmath87 , where const.=@xmath88 depends on the internal structure of the giant .",
    "( @xmath89 for a solid uniform density sphere , and less for a star - like centrally condensed sphere ) . assuming a centrally condensed star ( giant ) such that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 we estimate @xmath94 , showing that in the right circumstances , the planet could spin up the giant to the rotational velocities observed in dtype sss .    0.3 cm fast rotation , i.e. @xmath95 , may change a spherical star with a spherical wind into an equatorially flattened system , with both the radius of the star and stellar wind parameters depending on the stellar latitude .",
    "such stars will have an equatorial radius significantly larger than the polar one , and equatorially enhanced mass loss ( see lamers 2004 and references therein ) .    because it seems that the majority of the giants in dtype sss are rapid rotators ( sect .",
    "[ critvel ] ) , we expect that : + * ( 1 ) * they have a larger mass loss rate than the slower rotating giants ; + * ( 2 ) * their mass loss is enhanced in the equatorial regions ; + * ( 3 ) * they could be even equatorially flattened . + it is possible , that the dusty environment in dtype sss is connected with rapid rotation of the mass donors .",
    "intense mass loss in the equatorial regions can lead to the formation of an excretion disc in which the higher gas density enhances dust formation and growth .",
    "the broad ir excess in dtype sss can be due to the temperature stratification in the dust from such an excretion disc ( van winckel et al .",
    "1994 ) . other possible explanations for the presence of dust can be that it is left over from the formation of a planetary system , or it is a relic from a strong dusty mass loss when the present day white dwarf was on the agb .",
    "however , we consider it is more likely that it originates in the current outflow and that this is enhanced in the equatorial regions by rapid rotation .",
    "our main results are :    \\(1 ) we have measured the rotational velocities of the mass donors in dtype symbiotic stars , using the ccf approach .",
    "\\(2 ) four of the five objects appeared to be very fast rotators compared with the catalogues of  for the corresponding spectral types .",
    "at least three of them rotate at a substantial fraction ( @xmath0 ) of the critical velocity .",
    "this means that at least in dtype sss , the cool components rotate faster than isolated giants ( as predicted by soker 2002 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) if they are tidally locked , the orbital periods should be as short as @xmath8010 - 50 days .",
    "\\(4 ) as a result of the rapid rotation , they must have larger mass loss rates than the more slowly rotating giants , and their mass loss is probably enhanced in the equatorial regions .    to understand better these objects",
    ", we need their binary periods to be derived from radial velocity measurements and the inclination determined . in subsequent papers ,",
    "we plan to explore the projected rotational velocity of the cool giants in the other types of symbiotic stars and to compare their rotational velocities with that of the isolated giants with similar mass and evolutionary stage .",
