    "the important puzzle in the explanation of ferromagnetism in the system of single band electrons is proper taking into account the coulomb correlation between electrons .",
    "the hubbard model  @xcite , which describes the single non - degenerate electron band with local coulomb interaction , is incapable to describe ferromagnetism and requires the generalization .",
    "it is naturally to generalize the model hamiltonian by accounting other matrix elements of electron - electron interaction ( in addition to the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ) and to consider the ferromagnetism in the generalized hubbard model ( for review on this problem see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "note that last time the problem of metallic ferromagnetism in the single band hubbard model and their generalizations has attracted much attention of researchers in a series of papers by means of the gutzwiller variational wave function approximation  , the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite , the spectral density approximation  @xcite , the exact diagonalization method  @xcite and mean - field theory  @xcite . in the papers of hirsch",
    "@xcite the generalization of stoner - wolfarth theory  @xcite was carried out .",
    "the stoner - wolfarth theory has been used for the description of band electron magnetism ( denote in this connection , that the calculations in this theory essentially depend on the shape and peculiarities of the density of states , in particular , it is known that the incomplete ferromagnetism in this model is absent if the density of state is rectangular  @xcite ) .",
    "the considered generalization  @xcite has shown that the inter - atomic exchange interaction plays the key role for the obtaining of ferromagnetic state with partially polarization . using the mean - field theory hirsch",
    "has obtained the condition of ferromagnetic state realization , nonmonotonic behaviour of the concentration dependence of magnetization , the expression for the curie temperature , temperature dependencies of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "using local approximation developed from the gutzviller wave function method also suggest ( in agreement with  @xcite ) the importance of inter - atomic exchange interaction for the stabilization of ferromagnetic state with partial spin polarization . in the ref .  @xcite the opposite case of strong correlation has been studied and the criterion of ferromagnetism and magnetization of the system in ground state have been derived .    at our point of view",
    "it is in principle necessary to consider in addition to the inter - atomic exchange interaction the matrix elements that describe the correlated hopping of electrons  @xcite for the explanation of ferromagnetism in single band model .",
    "taking into account the correlated hoppind has alloved to explain some peculiarities of metal - insulator transition in single band model  @xcite and double orbitally degenerate model  @xcite . in this model",
    "an electron hopping from one site to another is correlated both by the occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process and the occupation of the nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "taking into account the correlated hopping allows to obtain the additional mechanism  @xcite for the stabilization of ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the importance of correlated hopping for understanding of the metallic ferromagnetism was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the results , obtained by means of exact diagonalization and mean - field theory for small one - dimensional chain of atoms were compared .",
    "it has been shown that in strong coupling regime correlated hopping favours ferromagnetism stronger for electron concentration @xmath0 than for @xmath1 ( the reverse situation occurs at weak interactions  @xcite ) ; this result agrees with conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite . using the gutzviller approach the authors of ref .   have shown , that the correlated hopping favour the ferromagnetic ordering around the point of half - filling .",
    "the magnetic properties of the system at nonzero temperature in the case of strong and intermediate electron correlations was analyzed in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "however the important question concerning the influence of correlated hopping on the curie temperature , on the behaviour of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility at nonzero temperature is not yet considered .",
    "the main goal of the article is to show the principle necessity to take into account both correlated hopping of electrons and inter - atomic exchange for the correct description of metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "note that the application of mean - field theory leads to the overestimation of ferromagnetic tendencies and gives the results , which agree with experiment only qualitatively .",
    "at the same time it is interesting to investigate the case of weak electron correlations and to define the mechanismes which are responsible for the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the mean - field analyzis in spite of its limitation allows to reproduce the behaviour of the magnetic moment and curie temperature at the change of electron concentration , the correct temperature dependence of magnetic moment of the system .",
    "besides we believe that taking into account the correlated hopping allows to avoid the overestimation of curie temperature .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in the sec .",
    "2 the hamiltonian of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping and inter - atomic exchange interaction is written and the single electron energy spectrum obtained in the case weak electron interactions by means of green function technique is analyzed . in the sec .",
    "3 the ground state properties of the system is considered , the equation on the system critical parameters and expression for the magnetization are derived . in the sec .",
    "4 the finite temperature properties of the system are considered , the expression for the curie temperature , temperature dependencies of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are obtained .",
    "the sec .",
    "5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "let us write the hamiltonian , proposed in refs .",

    "the concentration dependence of the effective hopping integral @xmath20 is caused by the correlated hopping  @xcite of electrons .",
    "the peculiarities of the model described by the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) are taking into account the influence of site occupation on hopping process ( correlated hopping ) and the direct exchange interaction between electrons in neighbour sites . in this model",
    "an electron hopping from one site to another is correlated both by the occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process and the occupation of the nearest - neighbour sites ( in contrast to similar generalized hubbard models ) .    to characterize the value of the correlated hopping we introduce dimensionless parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 which are independent on the number of site .",
    "in terms of green functions method using the mean - field approximation we have recently obtained  @xcite the single electron energy spectrum , which in the external magnetic field has the following form @xmath23 here the spin - dependent shift of the band centers is @xmath24 z is the number of nearest neighbours to a site , for the spin  @xmath25 we have @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( the sum goes over the nearest neighbours to a site ) , and the spin and concentration dependent hopping integral is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the half of band width , @xmath30 is the hopping integrals between nearest neighbour sites and @xmath31 the energy spectrum  ( [ spectr ] ) will be used in the next sections for the description of the model properties in the ground state and at the finite temperature .",

    "the peculiar distinction of the obtained expression from the similar condition , obtained in refs .   for the various generalizations of the hubbard model is the presence of correlated hopping , which can essentially modify the properties of the model .",
    "taking into account correlated hopping leads to the appearance of a peculiar kinetic mechanism of ferromagnetic ordering stabilization .",
    "this mechanism is caused by the presence of the spin - dependent shift of the spin subband centers being the consequence of correlated hopping ( which are analogous to the shift of subband centers in consequence of inter - atomic direct exchange interaction ) .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization ( in the absence of magnetic field ) of the system is found from the equation ( [ umova_m ] ) as @xmath48 which is valid in the case @xmath49 ( when @xmath50 only the transition from paramagnetic to fully polarized ferromagnetic state with @xmath51 occurs ) . if the calculated magnetization @xmath52 it is necesarry to put @xmath51 .",
    "the influence of correlated hopping on the properties of the system is illustrated on the figs .  1 ,  2 . on the fig .  1 the dependence of the critical value of exchange integral at which the ferromagnetic ordering occurs is plotted ( at the absence of magnetic field ) as a function of band filling at various values of correlated hopping parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and intra - atomic coulomb interaction @xmath55 .",
    "solid curves correspond to the onset of spin polarization , dashed curves correspond to the fully polarized ferromagnetic state ( the area below the solid line is paramagnetic , above the dashed line - fully polarized ferromagnetic , between lines - partially polarized ferromagnetic ) .",
    "the similar phase diagrams have been obtained in the refs .",
    "@xcite , but in those works the correlated hopping was not considered .",
    "note that the presence of correlated hopping ( curves  2 ,  3 on the fig .",
    "1 ) leads to the essential change of phase boundary of paramagnet - ferromagnet transition , in particular , to the shift of the minimum point , namely to the inequivalence of the cases @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    on the fig .",
    "2 the dependence of ground state magnetization @xmath56 on the electron concentration @xmath57 at the fixed values of exchange and coulomb interactions , as well as at different values of correlated hopping parameters is plotted . in refs .  @xcite the concentration dependencies of magnetization in the framework of hubbard model with inter - atomic exchange were obtained , but they are symmetrical respecting the point of half - filling . in the ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the case @xmath58 ) the similar @xmath59 dependence was obtained .    as mentioned above",
    ", the asymmetry of cases @xmath1 and @xmath0 is obsereved ; in particular , the increase of parameter @xmath53 leads to the shift of the ferromagnetic area in a region of larger electron concentration @xmath57 , the increase of parameter @xmath54 - in a region of smaller @xmath57 .",

    "note that the curie temperature is tightly related ( in the used approximation ) to ground state magnetization of ferromagnet .",
    "the peculiarity of formula  ( [ t_c ] ) is the presence of term related to correlated hopping @xmath54 ( @xmath56 is also dependent on this parameter ) , which in the case @xmath0 is negative and therefore lowers the curie temperature .",
    "this circumstance ( at correspondent choice of correlated hopping parameters ) , at our opinion allow to overcome the considerable defect of mean - field treatment , namely the overestimation of the curie temperature ( in this connection also see ref .",

    "3 the concentration dependence of the curie temperature is plotted at various values of correlated hopping . the peculiarity of this dependence is the lowering of the curie temperature at the increase of carriers concentration . besides taking into account the correlated hopping causes the asymmetry of curve respecting the point of half - filling , that allows to explain qualitatively the larger curie temperature in co as compared to fe . note for the comparison that this fact can not be explained in the ref .",
    "@xcite without further comments ( in particular , taking into account the density of states with peculiarities ) . on basis of",
    "obtained expression for the curie temperature one can explain the peculiarities of curie temperature behaviour in the binary alloys of transition metals  @xcite .",

    "the same subsystem of electrons is responsible both for conductivity and for the localized magnetic moments formation .",
    "although these compounds are adequately described in the framework of double orbitally degenerate model , even in terms of single band model at some values of model parameters it is possible to obtain the concentration dependencies of the curie temperture and magnetic moment of system ( see",

    "the plotted curves have a peculiarities : one can distinquish the area of sharp increase of the curie temperature at the increase of parameter @xmath55 ( this values of model parameters correspond to the partial spin polarization of system ) and the area , where the curie temperature changes in proportion to @xmath55 ( this values correspond to full spin polarization of system ) .",
    "note that the increase of inter - atomic exchange interaction leads to the extension of partially polarized ferromagnetic area , and also to the decrease of critical value of @xmath16 , required for the development of saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "the peculiarity of the dependence of the curie temperature on the @xmath55 is the increase of critical value @xmath55 at the increase of @xmath57 .",
    "note also that the changing of this critical value ( at choosen values of correlated hopping ) in the case @xmath0 and at the increase of electron concentration is more pronounced than in the case @xmath1 .",

    "in this paper the ferromagnetic solution in a single band generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping is derived .",
