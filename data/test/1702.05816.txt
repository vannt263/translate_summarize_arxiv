    "the isoperimetric problem is a classical subject in differential geometry with its origin in ancient greece .",
    "it consists in finding on a riemannian manifold @xmath2 the regions that minimize the perimeter among sets enclosing the same volume .",
    "the solutions are called isoperimetric regions and their boundaries isoperimetric hypersurfaces .",
    "the euclidean plane is historically the first space where the problem started to be investigated rigorously .",
    "it is now a well known fact that the round circles are the optimal curves for the problem .",
    "this geometric fact is often seen through the following classical inequality : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the length and the enclosed area of a simple closed curve @xmath6 respectively .    the framework of geometric measure theory and its tools work successfully well in tackling the aspects of existence and regularity of this variational problem .",
    "when @xmath7 is closed or homogeneous , then isoperimetric hypersurfaces do exist and are smooth up to a closed set of hausdorff dimension @xmath8 .",
    "the regular part is a stable hypersurface of constant mean curvature .",
    "this major contribution to the isoperimetric problem was achieved thanks to the efforts of many people , including f. almgren , r. schoen , l. simon , f. morgan , and others ( see @xcite for a comprehensive list ) . despite the long history of the problem",
    ", it remains largely open with few 3-manifolds where the problem is completely understood .",
    "the simply connected space forms , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are the most appealing spaces to begin the study of the isoperimetric problem .",
    "it turns out that their symmetries are enough to characterize the geodesic spheres as the isoperimetric hypersurfaces .",
    "a complete solution on @xmath12 with the standard product metric can be found in @xcite .",
    "for other homogeneous manifolds with certain product structure , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite respectively . the case @xmath16 is also treated in @xcite and",
    "they show that when @xmath17 unduloids are minimizers rather than cylinders for certain volumes .",
    "one key idea exploited in the results listed above is the use of symmetry to reduce the problem to an ode analysis .",
    "the case @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a flat torus is not solved in full ; great progress can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "more generally , it is known that boundaries of small isoperimetric regions in closed manifolds are nearly round spheres , see @xcite .",
    "to finish this brief and not exhaustive account of results on the isoperimetric problem we mention that bray and morgan ( @xcite and @xcite ) classified the horizon homologous isoperimetric surfaces in the schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the work in @xcite highlighted the interesting relationship between isoperimetric surfaces and the concept of mass in general relativity .",
    "we will be interested in spherical space forms in this paper .",
    "a significant result in this direction was given in @xcite where a. ros and m. ritor solved the isoperimetric problem in the projective space @xmath20 .",
    "they show that the solutions are geodesic spheres or flat tori .",
    "later , a. ros @xcite used the above result to give a proof of the willmore conjecture in @xmath21 for the special case of surfaces that are invariant by the antipodal map .",
    "the real projective space is a special case of an important family of riemannian manifolds , namely the lens spaces @xmath22 .",
    "these are elliptic space forms obtained as a quotient of @xmath21 by a finite group of isometries that are isomorphic to @xmath23 but which also depend on @xmath24 .",
    "they are , along with @xmath25 , characterized by having heegaard genus one .",
    "we give a complete solution for the isoperimetric problem in the lens spaces with large fundamental group :    [ theorem 1 ] _ there exists a positive integer @xmath26 such that for every @xmath27 and every @xmath28 the isoperimetric surfaces in @xmath22 are either geodesic spheres or tori of revolution about geodesics . _    the isoperimetric problem in dimension three was previously solved for only a finite number of non - diffeomorphic 3-manifolds .",
    "we also add to the literature the observation that the proof of the willmore conjecture by marques and neves @xcite can be applied to extend the work of ros and ritor @xcite , on the classification of stable cmc surfaces in @xmath20 , to @xmath0 and @xmath1 : and @xmath1 are diffeomorphic but not isometric . ]    [ theorem 2 ] _ the immersed stable cmc surfaces in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are either geodesic spheres or flat tori .",
    "moreover , the minimal clifford torus is , up to ambient isometries , the only index one minimal surface in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "_    the idea of the proof of theorem [ theorem 1 ] is as follows .",
    "stability implies that every isoperimetric surface is connected and its genus is @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "if follows from a classical result of hopf that if the genus is 0 , then it is a geodesic sphere .",
    "from @xcite we know that if the genus is 1 , then it is flat , and this forces the surface to be of revolution about a geodesic .",
    "we are left to rule out other topological types .",
    "to do so we argue by contradiction .",
    "we assume that there exists a sequence of lens spaces with increasing fundamental group containing isoperimetric surfaces of genus @xmath31 .",
    "after a suitable rescaling on the metrics we use compactness results to obtain a limit for the sequence of lens spaces which will be a flat three manifold of rank one . in the same way , the sequence of isoperimetric surfaces will converge to a flat surface in the respective ambient manifold .",
    "the topology of the surfaces will force the limit to be an union of planes . on the other hand , the minimization property rules this configuration out .",
    "the arguments in the proof of theorem [ theorem 1 ] generalize naturally for the berger spheres @xmath32 .",
    "this is a well known one parameter family of homogeneous metrics on the 3-sphere ; the case @xmath33 corresponds to the round metric .",
    "all the hopf fibers in @xmath32 have the same length @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 is not too small , spheres are the only solutions of the isoperimetric problem , see @xcite . when @xmath35 is very small , it is pointed out in @xcite that some tori are better candidates to solve the isoperimetric problem rather than spheres for certain volumes .",
    "_ there exists @xmath36 such that for every @xmath37 the isoperimetric surfaces in the berger spheres @xmath32 are either rotationally invariant spheres or tori . _",
    "it follows from the work in @xcite and @xcite that the minimal clifford torus in @xmath38 ( resp .",
