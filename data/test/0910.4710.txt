    "the biological and physical properties of proteins are compelling for many reasons .",
    "while just a small amount of the nowadays hundreds of thousands known protein sequences are experimentally characterized , the variety of their functions is overwhelming .",
    "though the structure has been resolved only for a subset of these sequences , the number of stable folds that are expressed in nature is seemingly small compared to the number of sequences .",
    "the relationship between fold and function is far from obvious , and examples such as intrinsically unstructured proteins and multi - functional folds resist simple schemes for classification .",
    "the question what really makes a protein functional hence needs to be addressed in the context of its specific biological environment .    from a physical point of view , an attempt to find some unifying concepts for the interpretation of dynamics and thermodynamics is the description of proteins in term of energy landscapes@xcite , in which the evolution of the system is related to the dynamics on a high - dimensional rugged energy surface .",
    "the existence of local minima , connected by saddles of different barrier height and rank , leads to a distribution of timescales that are reflected in the dynamics of the proteins .",
    "although the energy landscape provides a reduced description , the complex interactions in proteins and their interaction with the environment , which involve multi - body interactions and subtle effects of charges , make its complete characterization neither experimentally nor theoretically conceivable .",
    "this situation is somewhat reminiscent of other complex systems such as glasses which , though being more homogeneous systems , share the property of displaying a high - dimensional landscape leading to complex dynamics .",
    "the energy landscape picture is useful for a qualitative analysis of protein properties , but for quantitative studies , an exhaustive sampling and and the full characterization are practically infeasible for this high - dimensional representation .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain comprehensive quantitative predictions on generic protein properties from the information on the landscape , the picture needs to be simplified .",
    "a recent work@xcite has shown that a reduced description of the energy landscape , originally devised for the analysis of super - cooled liquids by stillinger and weber@xcite , can successfully capture the essential thermodynamic aspects of folding in the context of a simplified protein model .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the density of states constructed from the local minima of the energy landscape , called inherent structures , can be used to compute the most important thermodynamic observables .",
    "this finding is important because it provides a general scheme for theoretical studies of protein thermodynamics , showing how the relevant information can be quantitatively accessed from its imprint on the potential energy surface .",
    "the approach has consequently been used in the context of studies of the folding properties of a @xmath0-barrel forming protein@xcite , the construction of the free energy landscape by mechanical unfolding@xcite , and the network of native contacts@xcite .",
    "other earlier works including inherent structure analysis but not necessarily seeking to characterize the full thermodynamics of folding can be found in @xcite .",
    "however the validity of an analysis based on the inherent structure landscape ( isl ) must be critically examined because the method involves a fundamental assumption which could be questioned : the vibrational free energy within the basin of attraction of an inherent structure is assumed to be independent of the basin . a recent study @xcite tried to go beyond this approximation by assuming that the vibrational free energy can depend on the energy of the inherent structures .",
    "still , the question is subtle as we show in the present work that , even when the vibrational free energy depends on the inherent structure energy , the derivation of thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat from the isl can be validly carried without any change in the procedure .",
    "therefore an understanding of the limits of the isl approach requires a deeper analysis .",
    "this is the aim of the present work .",
    "we proceed in two steps . in a first step ( section [ section3 ] ) , after briefly summarizing the isl formalism and introducing the protein model used in section [ section2 ] , we test the validity of the isl approach by comparing its results to the data obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics for a set of structures .",
    "we selected four previously unstudied two - state folding proteins of varying size and secondary structure elements . in a second step ( section   [ section4 ] )",
    ", we critically revisit the major hypotheses of the isl approach , as well as its practical limitations , such as the sampling of the phase space , and suggest routes for improvements .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section [ section5 ] and give an outlook on possible future studies that stem from our results .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly review the major results of @xcite on obtaining reduced thermodynamics from an analysis of the inherent structures .",
    "the method is general and not bound to a specific protein model , provided the phase space of the protein can be explored by molecular dynamics , and that the energies of the visited states can be calculated . from simulations at fixed temperature close to the folding temperature @xmath1 , which insures that the system evolves in a large part of the configuration space , the local potential minima , labelled by @xmath2 ,",
    "are determined by conjugate gradient minimizations performed at fixed frequency along a molecular dynamics trajectory .",
    "the global minimum @xmath3 is defined as the reference ground state with zero energy .",
    "let @xmath4 , denote the @xmath5 cartesian coordinates of the @xmath6-particle system , and @xmath7 its potential energy function .",
    "the probability to find a particular minimum @xmath2 with potential energy @xmath8 can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the configurational part of the partition function and @xmath12 is the basin of attraction of the minimum @xmath2 . with the definition@xmath13 the unknown integral over the complex landscape of the basin of attraction @xmath12",
    "is summed in an free - energy like function @xmath14 which in principle depends both on the nature of the basin and temperature .",
    "notice that although we use the index @xmath15 like  vibrational  , @xmath14 is obtained from the full nonlinear integral over @xmath12 , and not from its harmonic approximation .",

    "the energy scale is shifted such that the energy of the global minimum @xmath3 is zero .",

    "is isolated , one obtains @xmath31 with the probability of the ground state @xmath32 , so that the inherent structure density of states can be estimated from the probability to be in the basin of attraction of a minimum in a fixed temperature simulation at temperature @xmath33 as @xmath34 though above we have chosen a continuous notation to simplify the equations , it should be noted that the density built from an estimate of the probability density function of sampled minima for the present model in practice always comprises discrete and continuous parts which can be integrated separately .",
    "once the inherent structure density of states is known , one can compute the inherent structure partition function @xmath35 from ( [ eq : piszis ] ) , from which all thermodynamics functions can be derived , including the free energy @xmath36 and the internal energy @xmath37 .",
    "given that most states of the system can be sampled close to the folding temperature , it is sufficient to simulate the system at a single temperature @xmath33 to construct the inherent structure landscape , in contrast to the full thermodynamics where one needs to sample different ranges of temperatures",
    ". therefore , the isl approach can be computationally very efficient . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the computation of specific heat @xmath38 being a quantity of fundamental importance in a physical system , as it is sensitive to fluctuations and , for instance , shows a clear signature of phase transitions .",
    "it can be deduced from numerical derivatives of the partition function @xmath39 through @xmath40 and hence @xmath41      since our goal is to analyze the validity of the isl approach and not to derive quantitative data for a particular protein , we decided to choose a simplified model , which allows the sampling of phase space at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "however the model must be rich enough to properly describe the complex features of its physics , and should be able to distinguish between proteins which differ , for instance , in their secondary structure .",
    "we use frustrated off - lattice g - models identical to the ones introduced in @xcite because they provide a good compromise between all - atom simulations and simplified models that do not fully describe the geometry of a protein .",
    "these models provide a representation with a single particle per residue centered at the location of each @xmath42-atom . for details on the model and the parameters",
    ", we refer to @xcite and a brief review in the appendix [ ap1 ] .",
    "although the validity of such models to provide a faithful representation of protein folding is a recurrent subject of debate , off - lattice g - models have been successfully used to study folding kinetics @xcite and the mechanical resistance of proteins @xcite . from a physical point of the view , despite a strong bias towards the ground state , these models have a complex energy landscape with a large number of local minima well suited for the analysis in terms of inherent structures . + as the results of the isl approach depend on the density of states of the inherent structures , for a reliable test of the method it is important to examine examples which could differ in their properties , i.e. to investigate proteins of different size and structure . to test the inherent structure approach beyond the previously employed immunoglobulin ( ig ) binding domain of protein g ( 2gb1 )",

    "the native contacts of the model were established according to the distances between atoms belonging to different residues .",
    "a native contact is formed if the shortest distance belonging to atoms of two different residues is smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "the number of native contacts according to this criterion are : @xmath47 for the ww domain , @xmath48 for ubiquitin , @xmath49 for src - sh3 and @xmath50 for trp - cage .",
    "this definition is simple and includes some arbitrariness .",
    "there exist other methods for probing contacts between side - chains , e.g. by invoking the van der waals radii of residue atoms and solvent molecules@xcite .",
    "though using the latter method preserves the main structure of the contact map , it leads to quantitative differences in the the number and location of contacts along the sequence .",
    "consequently , one can expect that the topology of the energy surface and key thermodynamic properties such as the folding temperature are also altered when the definition of the contact map is varied .",
    "for the purpose of the present study which does not attempt to give a quantitative description of side chain contacts , and focusses on global properties of the landscape rather than its detailed relation to the network of contacts , the cutoff - based approach is acceptable .",

    "the two are related by @xmath108 a similar result was also reported in @xcite which considered the particular case of a piecewise linear dependence on @xmath89 . though the densities differ , substituting ( [ relatedens ] ) in equations ( [ newzis ] ) or ( [ eq : piszis ] ) , we immediately have @xmath109 , and the inherent structure observables such as @xmath110 and @xmath111 are unchanged , i.e. @xmath112 and @xmath113 even when @xmath114 . + as a consequence , using equation ( [ newz ] ) , the full free energy @xmath115 of the protein can be written as @xmath116 therefore , in the isl formalism , taking into account the variation of @xmath16 as in equation ( [ separation ] ) does not alter the free energy and can not be expected to be at the origin of the quantitative differences between @xmath55 derived from the isl formalism and the full numerical results presented in section [ section3 ] .",
    "we conclude that the origin of these discrepancies is likely to be found in the non - separability between the @xmath43 and the @xmath29 dependency within the basins .",
    "such an non - separability can be expected as soon as the anharmonicity of the different basins is taken into account .",
    "this is certainly relevant for proteins , in particular as the denaturation involves frequent transitions between basins of different shape and volume associated to the semi - rigid folded and the highly flexible unfolded state .",
    "+ when @xmath16 can not be separated into @xmath43- and @xmath29-dependent contributions to simplify the calculation of the partition function , the remaining possible approximation that can tackle the computational difficulty would be the saddle point approximation of the free energy @xcite .",
    "this approximation is acceptable in the thermodynamic limit for large systems , but can not be justified in the present problem as the number of particles involved is still small and the interactions between particles are heterogeneous . while the harmonic approximation seems to be invalid for the present problem which involves large conformational changes due to the denaturation transition , results on super - cooled liquids @xcite indicate that the correction of the heterogeneity of the basins at low temperatures is small and the decoupling approximation of vibrational and inherent structure contributions appears to be possible at least in these temperature regimes .",
    "the main practical difficulty of the isl method comes from the need to properly sample all the inherent structures in order to get a meaningful density of states @xmath69 in all energy ranges . in the present scheme of inherent structure sampling , a single temperature is selected to simulate the dynamics of the protein for a finite period of time .",
    "the choice of a temperature close to the folding temperature is natural as the protein samples both the folded and the unfolded configurations at this temperature .",
    "there are however two questions that have to be answered : _",
    "i ) _ how long should we follow a protein md trajectory to get a sufficient sampling ? _",
    "ii ) _ is it possible to combine data from simulations at a few different temperatures instead of keeping @xmath29 fixed ?",
    "+ let us first analyze the effect of the sampling time .",
    "it should be chosen long enough to cover the slowest intrinsic timescale of the system , and various trajectories with different initial conditions or realizations of the thermostat should be used to ensure that the order of events does not alter the shape of the distribution .",
    "an estimate of the time range that sampling must cover is provided by the folding / unfolding time of the protein , to guarantee that the protein explores both configurational subspaces .",
    "a possible check of the choice of the simulation time is to compute the specific heat with an increasing number of samples , and stop when the improvement brought by additional samples is negligible .",
    "still , as computer time is limited , it can not be ensured that all relevant states are sufficiently well sampled to yield a converged probability density . in particular ,",
    "the high energy minima are sampled only with low probability , such that the high energy cut - off in the density of states is likely to be underestimated in finite time sampling . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the impact of this cutoff on a model density to see how the inherent structure specific heat is possibly affected .    to analyze the effect of the sampling independently of a particular case ,",
    "let us assume a  model",
    " inherent structure density of states taken as a single exponential @xmath117 similar to the shape of the densities that can be found in limited ranges of energies for the numerical results in section [ section3 ] .",
    "the partition function than can be readily calculated as @xmath118 likewise , we can calculate the first two moments @xmath119 and @xmath120 to find the specific heat as a function of the temperature , the parameter @xmath121 and cutoff in energy @xmath122 @xmath123 and analyze the result graphically as a function of the energy cutoff @xmath122 in figure [ fig6 ] .     as a function of temperature and the cutoff parameter @xmath122 .",

    "using symbolical computation @xcite , we can further inspect the result to find the local maxima of the the specific heat for fixed cutoff @xmath122 . on the right - hand side of figure [ fig6 ]",
    ", we observe that a lower cutoff in the density of states shifts the maximum of the specific heat towards higher temperatures .",
    "in addition to the shift , the curve becomes broader and the value at the maximum decreases .",
    "this situation is similar to the physical scenario when protein folding is altered by confinement ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high energy states disappear from the density of states as the system is prohibited to explore these by external forces . for the present purpose of the inherent structure analysis , although derived for a highly idealized model density , the results indicate that insufficient sampling at high energies can significantly alter the global shape of the transition .",
    "we have checked that these conclusions remain unchanged for a piecewise constant density of states .",
    "for instance , for the ww domain , one finds @xmath125 which is higher than the range of values for which a shift of the maximum can be expected from figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "consequently , the origin of this shift can not be attributed to inefficient sampling in the high energy range .",
    "+ because the high energy minima are less frequently visited , it is tempting to try to sample the minima from a high temperature molecular dynamics trajectory . on the other hand , as the method relies on the probability to occupy the ground state which determines @xmath126 , it is also necessary to properly sample the ground state , i.e. to select a simulation temperature which is below @xmath1 . to reconcile these two exclusive conditions , one solution is to combine results sampled at two different temperatures to calculate @xmath69 , which should be temperature independent .",
    "this is possible because , according to ( [ eq : pz ] ) @xmath127 with @xmath128 , so that the ratio of @xmath129 can be calculated from the probabilities to occupy a basin at temperatures @xmath130 and @xmath131 . a molecular dynamics trajectory obtained at a temperature @xmath132 can be used to determine @xmath133 from the probability to occupy the ground state , and subsequently a second simulation at a higher temperature @xmath131 can sample high energy basins more efficiently",
    ". for all basins which are properly sampled in both molecular dynamics runs , the ratio @xmath129 can be evaluated with ( [ eq : zratio ] ) .",
    "although it should not depend on the particular basin that was used for its calculation , this ratio actually fluctuates around a mean value which can be used to determine @xmath134 from @xmath135 .",
    "then ( [ eq : pz ] ) , applied at the higher temperature @xmath131 , can be used to compute @xmath69 in the high energy range . moreover , in the intermediate energy range , the basins are properly sampled by the two trajectories at temperatures @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which gives two ways to evaluate @xmath69 for those basins , and thus provides a way to check the consistency of the method .",

    "for the simulations at @xmath131 , the ground state is not sampled in the finite interval of time of the simulations , but @xmath141 can nevertheless be obtained through the evaluation of @xmath142 deduced from @xmath143 for all values of @xmath89 for which the histograms of the left - hand side of figure [ fig:2 t ] overlap .",
    "the right - hand side of figure [ fig:2 t ] shows that the values of the density of inherent state energies computed from data at @xmath130 and @xmath131 are in rather good agreement in the whole energy range where the basins are sampled at the two temperatures .",
    "there is however a discrepancy between the two results , with a systematic deviation towards lower values of @xmath69 for high inherent state energies when the density of states is calculated with data sampled at high temperatures .",
    "this is counterintuitive as one could tend to believe that sampling the basins at low temperatures would , on the contrary , underestimate the density of basins at high energy .",
    "this systematic deviation , which has been observed in all our calculations could point out a limitation of the isl method as presently applied , i.e.  with a calculation which is only valid if @xmath144 is the sum of a term that depends on @xmath89 and a term that depends on temperature ( see ( [ separation ] )  ) . when the specific heat is calculated with the value of @xmath69 extended in the high energies range with this method ,",
    "the function is still very close to the value obtained with only the data at temperature @xmath130 and the agreement with the numerical value of @xmath57 is not improved .",
    "this shows that the discrepancy between the exact results and those deduced from the isl approach are not due to technical difficulties such as an insufficient sampling in some energy range , but that they are rather inherent to the method itself together with its assumptions .",
    "we applied the inherent structure landscape ( isl ) approach to four different proteins of varying size and secondary structure elements using a coarse - grained off - lattice protein model , and calculated their inherent structure density of states . using these densities , we derived the specific heat from the reduced inherent structure thermodynamics , and compared it to the value obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics as a function of temperature .",
    "our results show that the isl approach can correctly capture the shape of the temperature dependence of the specific heat , including some characteristic features such as the hump observed at @xmath145 for the ww domain .",
    "this is remarkable since the result is deduced from molecular dynamics simulations at a single temperature , close to @xmath1 , and nevertheless predicts the main features of the specific heat in a large temperature range , including low temperatures for which very long simulations would be necessary to reach exhaustive sampling of the phase space .",
    "this shows that _ many features of protein thermodynamics are encoded in the inherent structure landscape .",
    "_ still , the approach is not perfect as we observed quantitative differences between @xmath58 and @xmath57 which are particularly significant for small protein domains .",
    "the deviations show a systematic trend , the specific heat being underestimated below @xmath1 and overestimated above .",
    "this lead us to reexamine the approximations that enter the construction of the reduced thermodynamics from inherent structures for the model that we considered .",
    "the first approximation assumes that the correction to the density of states due to the structure of the basin associated to a minimum @xmath146 depends on the energy level of the minimum only , and not of the individual minimum .",
    "an evaluation of @xmath146 using a harmonic approximation based on local normal modes ( section [ nma ] ) shows that this is only approximately correct . for a given @xmath89 ,",
    "the values of @xmath147 are actually distributed around an average value , with fluctuations that grow for higher values of @xmath89 and that appear to be larger for small proteins .",
    "this could explain some of the discrepancies between the isl results and the equilibrium data .",
    "moreover , the calculation of @xmath147 indicates that the second assumption that the correction can be considered to be @xmath43-independent is certainly not valid .",
    "however , we showed that if @xmath148 splits into a temperature - dependent and an @xmath43-dependent part , which is the case in the harmonic approximation , most of the thermodynamic results deduced from a direct application of the isl approach are not affected .",
    "this is true in particular for the the specific heat . in view of the persisting quantitative differences between reduced inherent structure and equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "we therefore conclude that the correction of the free energy in term of a harmonic approximation is not sufficient .",
    "it is likely that the nonlinear terms in the free energy associated to a basin can not be ignored , and play a significant role .",
    "this is not surprising because , especially in the high temperature range , the protein fluctuates by exploring many basins , and consequently can not be assumed to be well described by a harmonic approximation .",
    "+ in future studies , it would be useful to analyze the role of the structure of the full basin on the thermodynamic results beyond the approximation by local normal modes around the minima .",
    "this is a true challenge owing to the complexity of the energy landscape . a starting point for",
    "such a study might be the examination of the distribution of first rank saddle points associated to the different minima on the potential energy surface .",
    "a second aspect which is suggested by the present work is to apply the isl approach for protein folding in the context of more complex energy landscapes that arise in more realistic potential energy functions .",
    "the results on the small proteins analyzed in this study show that the global separation of the probability density into two basins associated to folded and unfolded states is not a necessary requirement to construct the reduced thermodynamics .",
    "it appears therefore likely that the formalism remains useful in cases where the energy landscape is less biased towards the ground state than in the g - model .",
    "an application of the isl method to other protein models therefore appears to be desirable and promising .    *",
