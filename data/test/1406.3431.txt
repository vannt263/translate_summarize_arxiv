    "it is a commonly accepted hypothesis that buoyancy force drives planetary and stellar dynamos .",
    "indeed , on earth , the prevalent model is that the current magnetic field comes from thermo - chemical convective motions within the conducting liquid core .",
    "however , the validity of this convection driven dynamo model has recently been questioned in certain cases , such as ganymede , mercury and mars @xcite , or the early moon @xcite .",
    "alternative dynamo mechanisms , based on a different forcing , thus seem needed .",
    "however , very few natural forcings have been identified as dynamo - capable in planets and stars : ( i ) thermo - solutal convection @xcite , which is the standard mechanism generally applied to all planetary configurations even if it is not proved to be always relevant ; and ( ii ) precession @xcite , a purely mechanical forcing that may drive dynamos @xcite , despite a well - known controversy on its energetic budget ( see @xcite for critical discussions of this hypothesis , and @xcite for its rehabilitation ) .",
    "tides have been proposed as an alternative dynamo mechanism ( see e.g. @xcite for mars , or @xcite for the early moon ) or as a key ingredient for the magnetic field dynamics ( e.g. @xcite for the star @xmath0 boo ) , but the possibility to generate large scale magnetic fields via tides - driven flows has not been confirmed yet .",
    "several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that the flows needed for dynamo action could be provided by an elliptical ( also called tidal ) instability excited by tides ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". this hydrodynamic instability , which comes from the local ellipticity @xmath1 of streamlines , can arise in any fluid rotating at @xmath2 provided that ( i ) the dimensionless fluid viscosity @xmath3 is small enough compared to @xmath1 ( @xmath4 being the fluid kinematic viscosity , and @xmath5 the typical streamline radius ) , and ( ii ) the differential rotation between the fluid rotation and the streamlines distortion is non - zero .",
    "when this instability is present , @xcite show that the evolution of the magnetic field decay rates with the magnetic reynolds number does not forbid the possibility of tidally driven large - scale dynamos .",
    "recently , @xcite consider a small local patch of a rotating fluid , and their simulations of the elliptical instability ( hereinafter abbreviated as ei ) in a periodic box show that tidally driven small - scale dynamos are possible .",
    "the present study focuses on the dynamo effect of the ei in a rotating sphere .",
    "considering a sphere , instead of a tidally deformed geometry , allows us to benefit from the efficiency and accuracy of spectral methods . indeed , solving the dynamo problem in a more realistic geometry , such as an ellipsoidal one , is very difficult and remains a challenge ( e.g. *",
    "* ) . to investigate the dynamo problem we are interested in , we thus face the issue of establishing the tidal ( basic ) flow in global simulations of a rotating sphere , filled with an incompressible conductive fluid , and surrounded by an insulating medium . since a conservative force has no effect in this configuration ( see below for details )",
    ", we can establish the tidal flow , either by imposing a boundary non - zero radial flow ( as in the recent work of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by using a non - conservative body force with non - penetrative boundary conditions .",
    "in order to avoid a fluid which suddenly becomes insulating when crossing the boundary ( which would have uncertain consequences on the dynamo process ) , we consider here the second solution .    in section [ sec :",
    "intro ] , we introduce the problem and the methods used in this work .",
    "we first solve the hydrodynamic problem , in order to describe the tidally forced basic flow ( section [ sec : basicflow ] ) , and then the flow resulting from its destabilization by the ei when the body force is strong enough ( section [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "then , we add in section [ sec : kindyn ] the magnetic field into the problem , discarding its back - reaction on the flow in order to investigate the so - called kinematic dynamos . finally , we tackle the self - consistent dynamo problem by solving the fully coupled magnetohydrodynamic equations .",
    "we consider an incompressible newtonian fluid of density @xmath6 , kinematic viscosity @xmath4 , conductivity @xmath7 , and permeability @xmath8 , enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath5 , rotating with angular velocity @xmath2 .",
    "we choose @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 as the respective units of length , time and magnetic field . in the inertial frame of reference ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath11 is governed by @xmath12 with the ekman number @xmath3 , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath13 , and the fluid velocity @xmath14 , which is governed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reduced pressure , with @xmath17 the pressure , and the lorentz force @xmath18 is removed for kinematic dynamos , and kept for self - consistent ones .",
    "the body force @xmath19 aims at deforming the circular streamlines into elliptical ones , mimicking tidal effects . in the considered spherical geometry",
    ", the problem will be solved by taking the curl of equation ( [ eq : ns ] ) . to modify the flow , we thus need @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath19 can not be a conservative force ( in reality , tidal forces are conservative and deform the boundary , leading to elliptical streamlines , as in * ? ? ?",
    "we thus work with a kinematically prescribed body force , designed to drive a tidally like flow having elliptical streamlines in the bulk , i.e. @xmath21 with the cylindrical radial unit vector @xmath22 , and the spherical coordinates @xmath23 , with the radius @xmath24 , the colatitude @xmath25 and the azimuth @xmath26 . the force amplitude @xmath27 controls the amplitude of the streamlines deformation in the bulk of the fluid .",
    "note that the regularity of @xmath28 imposes certain constraints on the expression of @xmath29 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "note also that this force does not take into account the rotation of the tidal field due to the companion orbital motion .",
    "indeed , the rotation of the tidal strain does not modify the physical mechanisms of the ei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we thus focus on the simplest configuration , studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq : induction])-([eq : divu ] ) have to be complemented with boundary conditions .",
    "decomposing @xmath28 as @xmath30 , i.e. as a solid body rotation with a unit angular velocity and a perturbation @xmath31 , we impose a zero angular momentum and stress - free condition for @xmath31 ( which is equivalent to impose a non - zero angular momentum and stress - free conditions on @xmath28 ) . for the magnetic field , the external region ( @xmath32 )",
    "is assumed to be insulating .",
    "the problem is solved using the code h2000 , described in detail in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "briefly , the code implements a pseudo - spectral method , based on a discretization with chebychev polynomials in radius , and spherical harmonics in the angular variables .",
    "it uses the usual toroidal - poloidal decomposition , thereby automatically satisfying equations ( [ eq : divb ] ) and ( [ eq : divu ] ) .",
    "all nonlinear products are calculated in the physical space . in this work , simulations are all performed for @xmath33 .",
    "in the equatorial plane , from a simulation of the basic flow ( @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35).,width=264 ]    when @xmath36 , the basic flow is essentially a solid body rotation , modified by the force into elliptical streamlines within the bulk of the fluid ( figure [ figbasicflow ] ) . the basic flow is thus a steady flow , which only consists of even azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath37 , and the streamlines are smoothly deformed , from a circle at the boundary , to more and more deformed ellipses as we move towards the center .",
    "more quantitatively , noting @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the long and short main axes of the elliptic streamlines , the so - called ( local ) streamline ellipticity @xmath40 vary from @xmath41 , at the boundary , to a value increasing with @xmath27 at the center .",
    "this can be analytically described for the equatorial plane in the limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where little algebra shows that the flow is given by the streamfunction , in polar coordinates @xmath44 , as @xmath45 with the radial velocity @xmath46 , and the azimuthal velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the streamlines local ellipticity @xmath48 is thus @xmath49 at the outer boundary ( @xmath50 ) , and maximal at the center ( @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the h2000 numerical basic flow , and considering for instance the one shown in figure [ figbasicflow ] ( where @xmath27 is as large as @xmath53 ) , we obtain @xmath54 for @xmath51 .    note",
    "that the streamline ellipticity @xmath1 is the driving parameter of the ei @xcite , whereas the damping parameter is @xmath55 ( stress - free conditions only leads to a volume damping , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we thus expect elliptical instabilities as soon as the control parameter @xmath56 is large compared to @xmath57 somewhere in the bulk ( near the center actually , where @xmath1 is maximal ) .",
    "in presence of the ei ( the arrow indicates the rotation vector of the solid body rotation @xmath58 ) . ( bottom ) time - average @xmath59 , peak - to - peak value @xmath60 , and oscillation frequency @xmath61 of @xmath62 ( eq . [ eq : urms ] ) as a function of the ei threshold distance ( for @xmath33 , @xmath63 ) . in the sphere",
    ", @xmath64 is estimated using @xmath65 , which assumes that @xmath66 , as it is the case for the basic flow ( @xmath67).,width=264 ]    when @xmath27 is above the critical value @xmath68 , simulations show that the stationary basic flow is destabilized into a time - periodic flow .",
    "this instability can be investigated analytically in the limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , a classical ( local ) wkb stability analysis of the basic flow ( [ eq : basicflow ] ) can be performed in this limit , by assuming the perturbations to be local plane waves characterized by their wavevector @xmath69 , with a norm @xmath70 , and tilted by an angle @xmath71 to the rotation axis ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "this analysis confirms that the basic flow ( [ eq : basicflow ] ) can be destablized by an ei ( resonance of two plane waves for @xmath72 , as usual for the elliptical insability , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a local growth rate @xmath73 which gives a maximum growth rate @xmath74 reached for @xmath51 ( which is the usual inviscid growth rate @xmath75 , since @xmath76 at @xmath51 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that the lowest @xmath77 is typically @xmath78 ( spinover mode , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath79 gives a critical force amplitude of @xmath80 for @xmath33 , which is well beyond the validity condition @xmath36 of the theory , but quite close from the value @xmath68 given by the simulations .",
    "considering the non - linear equilibrated regime , the flow @xmath81 is roughly an oscillating bended vortex ( figure [ fig : comsol ] , top ) , which oscillates approximately at the rotation rate .",
    "this time - periodic flow remains equatorially symmetric at any time ( up to , at least , @xmath82 ) , as the basic flow , but contains all azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath37 .",
    "the flow time - evolution is actually quite complex , preventing any simple finer description .",
    "a more quantitative description of this flow is obtained by considering the typical velocity @xmath83 with @xmath84 the kinetic energy of @xmath31 , and @xmath85 the volume of the fluid . in figure",
    "[ fig : comsol ] ( bottom ) , we show the frequency @xmath61 , the time - average @xmath59 , and the peak - to - peak value @xmath60 of @xmath62 as a function of the distance from the ei threshold .",
    "we can question the relevance of the flow associated with the ei driven by the force , i.e. is it possible to obtain similar flows in a truly deformed container ?",
    "we have thus performed the same simulations in an ellipsoidal container , without any force ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "to do so , we have used a numerical model , implemented in the commercial code comsol , which has been described and validated in detail in @xcite . to be as close to a sphere as possible",
    ", the polar axis length @xmath87 is put equal to the long equatorial axis length @xmath38 , and we vary the length of the small equatorial axis @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , an ei sets in as soon as the ( uniform ) ellipticity @xmath40 of the basic flow streamlines is above a certain value . using @xmath88 as the length scale , we use the ekman number @xmath89 , and vary @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath1 is greater than @xmath90 , an instability sets in , and the basic flow is destabilized into a periodic equatorially symmetric flow .",
    "the spatial dependency is thus the same as the flow due to ei in the sphere .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : comsol ] , the frequencies @xmath61 of the ei driven flow are comparable in the sphere and in the ellipsoid , with @xmath91 just above threshold . this flow has been identified as the @xmath92 mode of the ei in @xcite , i.e. a parametric resonance between the underlying strain field , and two inertial modes , with respectively @xmath93 and @xmath94 . to conclude this section on the hydrodynamic flows , the force ( [ eq : force ] ) excites in the sphere an ei driven flow with the same spatial and temporal dependencies as the mode @xmath92 excited in an ellipsoid by the ei , which confirms the relevance of the force approach .",
    "the large amplitudes of the flow driven by the instability suggest the flow to be dynamo capable .",
    "to investigate kinematic dynamos , we remove the lorentz force @xmath18 from the problem .",
    "this allows to study the dynamo capability of the flow studied in section [ sec : hydro ] , without any back - reaction of @xmath95 .",
    "the goal is to identify the dynamo threshold , the critical value @xmath96 of @xmath97 above which we obtain exponentially growing magnetic eigenmodes .",
    "one can first wonder if the basic flow is itself dynamo capable .",
    "indeed , for any finite @xmath55 , ekman pumping leads to small axial velocities , which could a priori act as a dynamo ( similar dynamos have been observed by * ? ? ?",
    "* on the poincar flow forced by precession ) .",
    "one can also consider the flow normalized kinetic helicity @xmath98 in the south hemisphere @xmath99 , since @xmath100 is often related to dynamo action in the literature ( the flows being equatorially symmetric , @xmath101 is equatorially antisymmetric , and the helicity over the whole fluid domain is thus always zero ) . for the basic flow , @xmath102 in the sphere ( @xmath103 in the ellipsoid ) , indicating a weak helicity .",
    "besides , we did not find any dynamo excited on the basic flow , which does not preclude their existence at a sufficiently large @xmath97 .",
    "crrrrrrrrrr & @xmath104 & @xmath105 & @xmath106 & @xmath107 + @xmath96 & 6.69 & 5.595 & 3.16 & 2.47 + @xmath108 & 6.69 & 6.13 & 5.69 & 5.29 + @xmath109 & 0.041 & 0.050 & 0.054 & 0.063 +    for ei driven flows , kinematic dynamos are obtained , and the @xmath96 values ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) are comparable to those obtained for precession driven dynamos simulations @xcite .",
    "typical amplitudes of @xmath100 in the ei equilibrated regime is @xmath110 for the sphere ( @xmath104 ) , and @xmath111 for the deformed ellipsoid ( @xmath112 ) , showing that helicity can be generated , via the ei , in a fluid deformed by curl - free tidal forces . at @xmath107 , this amplitude",
    "is doubled in the sphere , and the decrease of @xmath96 with @xmath27 can thus be related to this increased and rather strong helicity ( however , no simple direct correlation has been found ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath96 with @xmath27 is also partially due to the increase of the flow amplitude @xmath59 with @xmath27 .",
    "however , since @xmath113 does not decrease as rapidly as @xmath96 with @xmath27 ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) , the decrease of @xmath96 can not be attributed to a simple rescaling by @xmath59 of a single critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath114 , valid for all the unstable flows .",
    "one can thus expect @xmath113 to be an upper bound for @xmath96 , and writes @xmath115 where @xmath116 according to equation ( [ eq : sigwk ] ) .",
    "the quite large @xmath96 values obtained here , compared to usual real values of @xmath97 ( @xmath117 in the sun s convection zone , and @xmath118 in planetary cores or in liquid - metal laboratory experiments ) , are thus actually not a problem since these large values are due to the large ekman number @xmath33 considered here .",
    "more costly simulations , with a smaller @xmath55 ( closer from the relevant range @xmath119 for planetary and stellar interior ) will naturally lead to a smaller @xmath120 ( eq . [ eq : sigwk ] ) , and thus a smaller @xmath96 .",
    "as an example , with the typical earth values @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , scaling the values of table [ tbl-2 ] with equation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) leads to @xmath123 , with @xmath76 and @xmath78 ( see sections [ sec : basicflow ] and [ sec : hydro ] ) , showing that the relevance of this mechanism can not be discarded on these simple arguments . for the earth",
    "however , note that the more relevant no - slip boudary conditions do not allow to conclude about an ei excitation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details , and for other planetary values of @xmath1 or @xmath55 ) .",
    "we next switch on the lorentz force to obtain self - consistent dynamos .",
    "typical time - evolutions of the magnetic energy @xmath124 are shown in figure [ figdynt ] ( top ) , showing that the solutions can become quasi - periodic .",
    "figure [ figdynt ] ( middle ) shows a typical snapshot of the magnetic field lines in the fluid ( see below for magnetic and kinetic energies spectra ) .",
    "for equilibrated fully coupled dynamos : from the bottom to the top , the parameters @xmath125 are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "( middle ) magnetic field lines , and velocity magnitude ( equatorial slice ) for the last time step ( @xmath130 ) of the simulation @xmath131 shown above .",

    "we note that @xmath135 , indicating that the lorentz force slightly dominates the coriolis force .",
    "for all the dynamos shown in figure [ figdynt ] ( bottom ) , @xmath136 is between @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( as for the small - scale dynamos of * ? ? ?",
    "* obtained in a periodic box),and @xmath95 oscillates at a frequency between @xmath139 and @xmath57 , i.e. on a nearly diurnal time scale .     of spherical harmonics ( @xmath105 , @xmath140).,width=264 ]    figure [ figspectrum ] shows time - averaged spectra of @xmath84 and @xmath141 .",
    "the spectra shapes are actually very similar to the ones obtained for the kinematic dynamos described in section [ sec : kindyn ] .",
    "the magnetic field is clearly dominated by a dipolar component , without any other strongly dominant harmonics .. note how smooth both spectra are , especially the magnetic energy .",
    "both spectra are also clearly well - resolved .",
    "we similarly checked that the radial structure ( for which 70 chebyshev polynomials were used ) is fully resolved for each simulation of this work .",
    "we are thus fully confident that the flow driven by the ei is capable of generating dipole - dominated dynamo .",
    "in this work , the important cpu cost of dynamo simulations in tidally - deformed ellipsoidal domains , which requires local methods , has been avoided by using a well - designed body force in a sphere simulated using a spectral code .",
    "it has allowed to show that the elliptical instability driven in a sphere by a tidally - like force can maintain a dynamo process at magnetic reynolds numbers comparable to critical magnetic reynolds numbers known for other mechanical forcings .",
    "there is considerable further work that could be done .",
    "first , considering lower ekman numbers would allow to use lower force amplitude , which would allow to be closer to planetary flows .",
    "second , it would be easy to consider a rotating force , in order to excite other modes of the elliptial instability ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . finally , the dynamo capability of the libration driven elliptical instability , possibly excited in sychronized moons and planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even of libration driven multipolar instabilities @xcite , could be tackled using the same approach .",
