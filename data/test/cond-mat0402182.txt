    "one particular field of interest is the interplay of the electron transport and excitations by an oscillating gate voltage , a microwave field , or an infrared laser , respectively .",
    "such excitations bear intriguing phenomena like photon - assisted tunneling @xcite and the adiabatic @xcite and non - adiabatic @xcite pumping of electrons .",
    "a prominent example for the control of quantum dynamics is the so - called coherent destruction of tunneling , i.e. , the suppression of the tunneling dynamics of a particle in a double - well potential @xcite , in a two - level system @xcite , or in a superlattice @xcite . recently ,",
    "coherent destruction of tunneling has also been found for the dynamics of two interacting electrons in a double quantum dot @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that a corresponding transport effect exists : if two leads are attached to the ends of a tunneling system , then a proper driving field can be used to suppress the current even in the presence of a large transport voltage @xcite .",
    "moreover , in such a system the corresponding shot noise level _ a priori _ can be controlled by proper ac fields @xcite . within this work",
    ", we provide more details on this noise control scheme and also explore its limitations .",
    "an intuitive description of the electron transport through time - independent mesoscopic systems is provided by the landauer scattering formula @xcite and its various generalizations .",
    "both the average current @xcite and the transport noise characteristics @xcite can be expressed in terms of the quantum transmission coefficients for the respective scattering channels . by contrast , the theory for driven quantum transport is less developed .",
    "scattering of a single particle by an arbitrary time - dependent potentials has been considered @xcite without relating the resulting transmissions to a current between electron reservoirs .",
    "such a relation is indeed non - trivial since the driving opens inelastic transport channels and , therefore , in contrast to the static case , an _ ad hoc _ inclusion of the pauli principle is no longer unique .",

    "[ sec : model ] a model for the leads and the conductor under the influence of external fields , we derive in sec .",
    "[ sec : scattering ] for a situation with time - periodic but otherwise arbitrary driving general expressions for the current and its noise and establish a connection to a floquet eigenvalue equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : approximations ] , we consider some special cases and approximations .",
    "section [ sec : application ] is devoted to the influence of an electromagnetic dipole field on a conductor consisting of a few tight - binding levels .",
    "situations with an ac transport voltage are addressed in appendix  [ app : ac.voltage ] , while in appendix  [ appendix : xi ] , we detail an alternative derivation which has been introduced in ref .  .",
    "we start out by introducing a model for the central conductor ( `` wire '' ) under the influence of an external driving field like , e.g. , a molecular wire subject to laser radiation or coupled quantum dots @xcite driven by microwaves or an oscillating gate voltage .",
    "the conductor is attached by tunneling couplings to external leads .",
    "the entire setup of our nanoscale system is described by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 where the different terms correspond to the wire , the leads , and the wire - lead couplings , respectively .",
    "we focus on the regime of coherent quantum transport where the main physics at work occurs on the wire itself . in doing so ,",
    "we neglect other possible influences originating from driving induced hot electrons in the leads , dissipation on the wire and , as well , electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "then , the wire hamiltonian reads in a tight - binding approximation with @xmath1 orbitals @xmath2 @xmath3 for a molecular wire , this constitutes the so - called hckel description where each site corresponds to one atom .",
    "the fermion operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 annihilate and create , respectively , an electron in the orbital @xmath2 . the influence of an applied ac field with frequency @xmath6 results in a periodic time - dependence of the wire hamiltonian : @xmath7 .",
    "the leads are modeled by ideal electron gases , @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) creates an electron in the state @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in the left ( right ) lead .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath13 establishes the contact between the sites @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the respective lead , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] .",
    "this tunneling coupling is described by the spectral density @xmath16 of lead @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "if the lead modes are dense , @xmath19 becomes a smooth function .",

    "the end sites are coupled to two leads with chemical potentials @xmath21 and @xmath22.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to fully specify the dynamics , we choose as an initial condition for the left / right lead a grand - canonical electron ensemble at temperature @xmath23 and electro - chemical potential @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "thus , the initial density matrix reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of electrons in lead @xmath17 and @xmath27 denotes the boltzmann constant times temperature .",
    "an applied voltage @xmath28 maps to a chemical potential difference @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the electron charge .",

    "the leads are time - independent .",
    "thus , it seemingly can not describe ac transport voltages .",
    "such a situation , however , can be mapped by a gauge transformation to one with time - independent chemical potentials as demonstrated in appendix  [ app : ac.voltage ] .",
    "due to their experimental accessibility , the central quantities in a quantum transport problem are the stationary current and the low - frequency part of its noise spectrum . within a scattering picture of _ non - driven _",
    "mesoscopic transport , both quantities can be expressed in terms of a transmission function @xmath34 which reflects the probability that an electron is transmitted from one lead to the other @xcite . due to energy conservation , the reversed process ,",
    "occurs with equal probability .",
    "this is no longer true for driven systems and , consequently , the scattering approach needs to be generalized .",
    "thus , in this section , we _ derive _ expressions for the currents and its noise properties for the transport through the time - dependent system modeled above .",
    "in the so - called wide - band limit , the more compact derivation presented in ref .   becomes possible , cf .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : xi ] . we will show that the average electrical current contains only transition probabilities and , thus , resembles a scattering formula . in clear contrast to the static two - terminal case",
    ", however , we will find that the noise depends in addition also on the phases of the scattering matrix .      to avoid the explicit appearance of commutators in the definition of correlation functions",
    ", we perform the derivation of the central transport quantities in the heisenberg picture . as a starting point",
    "we choose the operator @xmath35 that describes the charge accumulated in lead @xmath17 with respect to the initial state . due to total charge conservation ,",
    "@xmath36 equals the net charge transmitted across the contact @xmath17 ; its time derivative defines the corresponding current @xmath37 the current noise is described by the symmetrized correlation function @xmath38_+ \\big\\rangle \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] of the current fluctuation operator @xmath39 , where the anticommutator @xmath40_+=ab+ba$ ] ensures hermiticity .",
    "it can be shown that at long times , @xmath41 shares the time - periodicity of the driving @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to characterize the noise level by the zero - frequency component of @xmath42 averaged over the driving period , @xmath43 we find below that for two - terminal devices @xmath44 is independent of the contact @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the evaluation of the zero - frequency noise @xmath46 directly from its definition can be tedious due to the explicit appearance of both times , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this inconvenience can be circumvented by employing the relation @xmath49 which follows from the integral representation of eqs .   and , @xmath50 , in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "by averaging eq .   over the driving period and using @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the charge fluctuation operator and @xmath55 the time average .",
    "the fact that the time average can be evaluated from the limit @xmath56 allows to interpret the zero - frequency noise as the `` charge diffusion coefficient '' . as a dimensionless measure for",
    "the _ relative _ noise strength , we employ the so - called fano factor @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the time - average of the current expectation value @xmath59 .",
    "note that in a two - terminal device , the absolute value of the average current is independent of the contact @xmath17 .      in order to take the exclusion principle properly into account , we have formulated the transport problem under consideration in terms of second quantization .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of interactions , both the current and its noise can be traced back to the solution of the corresponding single - particle problem .",
    "thus , our next step is to relate the expectation value and the variance of the charge operator to the transmission of electrons from one lead to the other . for that purpose ,",
    "we start from the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath60 for these coupled linear equations , the formal solution @xmath61 involves the propagator @xmath62 of the corresponding single - particle problem . we insert into and use the initial condition to obtain for the transfered charge at long times [ i.e. , in the limit @xmath63 , where all transients die out and , in particular , the second line in eq",

    "then , from the time derivative of eq .",
    ", we find for the current through the left contact the result @xmath70 and _ mutatis mutandis _ for the current through the right contact .",
    "this expression already obeys the `` scattering form '' with the _ time - dependent _ transmission @xmath71 of electrons with energy @xmath72 from lead @xmath17 to lead @xmath73 . at asymptotic times",
    ", the transitions from the lead state @xmath74 to the lead state @xmath75 and the wire state @xmath2 happen with the rates @xmath76 the last term in the current describes a periodic charging of the wire stemming from the external driving . with an average over one driving period",
    ", this contribution vanishes and , thus , the dc current reads @xmath77 with @xmath78 denoting the time average of the rate .",
    "interchanging in eq .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 yields the negative current @xmath81 .",
    "thus , as expected from total charge conservation , the average current is , besides its sign , independent of the contact at which it is evaluated .",
    "we emphasize that obeys the form of the current formula obtained for a _ static _",
    "conductor within a scattering formalism .",
    "in particular , consistent with refs .   and  ,",
    "no `` pauli blocking factors '' @xmath82 appear in our derivation .",
    "in contrast to a static situation , this is in the present context relevant since for a driven system generally @xmath83 , such that a contribution proportional to @xmath84 would not cancel @xcite .",
    "the zero - frequency noise @xmath46 is conveniently derived from the charge fluctuation with the help of relation . expressing the charge fluctuation by the heisenberg operators yields for the initial condition after some algebra @xmath85 by using the completeness relation , we have achieved a form which is , besides the appearance of @xmath69 , symmetric under exchanging @xmath86 .",

    "do not contribute to the zero - frequency noise .",
    "this can be demonstrated by inserting for the propagator the explicit expressions and which we derive in the next subsection .",
    "interestingly enough , the noise @xmath46 depends on both the diagonal and the off - diagonal elements of the projector @xmath91 .",
    "by contrast , the current depends only on the diagonal elements of this operator . as a consequence , in the presence of driving it is not possible to express the noise solely by transmission _",
    "probabilities _ ; cf .",
    "eq .  , below .",
    "the evaluation of the rates @xmath92 and @xmath93 involves the matrix elements of the time - evolution operator @xmath62 with the wire and the lead states . in the following , we eliminate the lead states and will find expressions for the rates that depend explicitly only on the propagator for the wire electrons and the spectral density of the couplings to the leads .",
    "we start from the schrdinger equation for the propagator , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the single - particle hamiltonian underlying .",
    "formal integration with the initial condition @xmath96 results in the dyson equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the propagator in the absence of the wire - lead coupling .",

    "restrict ourselves to asymptotic times , @xmath63 , we have shifted the lower limit of the integrals accordingly . moreover , in order to perform the @xmath118-integration in eq .",
    ", we have introduced a converging factor @xmath119 and will finally consider the limit @xmath120 .",
    "for the further evaluation of the average current , we insert the transition amplitude into . after taking the time derivative , averaging over time @xmath47 , and considering the limit @xmath120 , we find @xmath121 and the corresponding expression for @xmath122 . we have introduced the notation @xmath123 . by use of the spectral density ,",

    "we emphasize that in the driven case this is no longer true .",
    "although below we focus on the computation of dc currents , we here continue the derivation of the transport quantities by presenting explicit expressions for the ac currents . we restrict ourselves to @xmath132 since @xmath133 simply follows by proper index replacements . evaluating @xmath132 ,",
    "we consider also the last term in eq .   which describes a periodic charging / discharging of the wire .",
    "apart from the time average we perform the same steps as in the derivation of the dc current and obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 denotes the charge oscillating between the left lead and the wire .",

    "is non - hermitian , the eigenvalues @xmath166 are generally complex valued and the ( right ) eigenvectors are not mutually orthogonal .",

    "a proof requires to account for the time - periodicity of the floquet states since the eigenvalue equation holds in a hilbert space extended by a periodic time coordinate @xcite .    using the floquet equation ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that with the help of the floquet states @xmath168 the propagator can be written as @xmath171 where the sum runs over all floquet states within one brillouin zone . consequently , the fourier coefficients of the green function [ cf .",

    "in the previous section , the dc current and the zero - frequency noise have been derived for a periodic but otherwise arbitrary driving . within the wide - band limit , both quantities can be expressed in terms of the solutions of the floquet equation , i.e. , the solution of a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem in an extended hilbert space .",
    "thus , for large systems , the numerical computation of the floquet states can be rather costly .",

    "this is indeed the case since the static situation is characterized by two relations : first , in the absence of spin - dependent interactions , we have time - reversal symmetry , @xmath173 and , second , all sidebands with @xmath129 vanish , i.e. , @xmath174 , where @xmath175 and @xmath176 is the green function in the undriven limit . then the current assumes the known form @xmath177 .\\ ] ] moreover in a static situation , the relation @xcite @xmath178   \\\\    + & t(\\epsilon ) \\left [ 1-t(\\epsilon ) \\right ]       \\left [ f_r ( \\epsilon ) - f_l ( \\epsilon ) \\right]^2 \\big\\ } . \\end{split}\\ ] ] for zero temperature , the terms in the first line vanish and pure shot noise remains .",

    "this is no longer the case .",
    "this becomes particularly evident in the high - frequency limit studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : approx : hf ] .",
    "it is known that in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , for small driving frequencies , the numerical solution of the floquet equation becomes infeasible because a diverging number of sidebands has to be taken into account . in more mathematical terms",
    ", floquet theory has no proper limit as @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "the practical consequence of this is that for low driving frequencies , it is favorable to tackle the transport problem with a different strategy : if @xmath181 is the smallest energy - scale of the hamiltonian , one computes for the `` frozen '' hamiltonian at each instance of time the current and the noise from the static expressions and being followed up by time - averaging .",

    "within this work , we focus on models where the driving enters solely by means of time - dependent matrix elements of the wire hamiltonian while the leads and the wire - lead couplings remain time - independent .",
    "an _ a priori _ different type of driving is the application of a time - dependent transport voltage . in this appendix",
    ", we demonstrate that a setup with an oscillating transport voltage can be mapped by a gauge transformation to a hamiltonian of the form .",
    "consequently , it is possible to apply the formalism derived derived in sec .  [",
    "sec : scattering ] also to situations with an oscillating transport voltage .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case where the electron energies of only the left lead are modified by an external @xmath160-periodic voltage @xmath357 with zero time - average , thus in the left lead @xmath358 the generalization to a situation where also the levels in the right lead are @xmath160-periodically time - dependent , is straightforward .",
    "since an externally applied voltage causes a potential drop along the wire @xcite , we have to assume for consistency that for an ac voltage , the wire hamiltonian also obeys a time - dependence .",
    "ignoring such a time - dependent potential profile enables a treatment of the transport problem within the approach of refs .   and  .",
    "in the general case , however , we have to resort to the approach put forward with this work .",
    "we start out by a gauge transformation of the hamiltonian with the unitary operator @xmath359 where @xmath360 describes the phase accumulated from the oscillating voltage .",
    "the transformation has been constructed such that the new hamiltonian @xmath361 possesses a time - independent tunnel coupling .",
    "since , the operator @xmath362 transforms as @xmath363 , the matrix elements @xmath364 of the wire hamiltonian acquire an additional time - dependence , @xmath365 the second term in the hamiltonian stems from @xmath366 . owing to the zero time - average of the voltage @xmath357 , the phase @xmath367 is @xmath160-periodic .",
    "therefore , the transformed wire hamiltonian is also @xmath160-periodic while the contact and the lead contributions are time - independent , thus , @xmath368 is of form  .",
    "in ref .  , the expressions and for the current and the noise in the wide - band limit have been derived by eliminating the leads in favor of a stochastic operator . in this appendix",
    ", we detail this approach .",
    "like in section [ sec : scattering ] , we start here also from the heisenberg equations  for the annihilation operators . the ones for the lead operators , eq .  , are easily integrated to read @xmath369 and @xmath370 accordingly . inserting into the heisenberg equations for the wire operators",
    "yields @xmath371 owing to the wide - band limit , the dissipative terms are memory free . within the chosen grand canonical ensembles",
    "the operator - valued gaussian noise @xmath372 obeys @xmath373 the current operator then assumes the form @xmath374    the homogeneous set of equations that corresponds to coincides with the equations of motion and which are solved by the floquet states @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the floquet states @xmath168 together with the adjoint states @xmath167 , allow to write the solution of in closed form .",
    "in the asymptotic limit @xmath63 , it reads @xmath375 where @xmath376 is the propagator for the wire electrons .    to obtain the current @xmath132 , we insert the operator into the expression and use the expectation values . with the green function ,",
    "we find the still unsymmetric expression @xmath377 f_l(\\epsilon ) \\big\\ } .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] for a symmetrization , we eliminate the backscattering terms , i.e. , terms containing @xmath378 , by use of the relation @xcite @xmath379 which follows readily from the floquet representation of the propagator and the floquet eigenvalue equation together with its adjoint . a subsequent fourier transformation with respect to @xmath380 yields",
    "by inserting the matrix element @xmath381 , we obtain from for the time - dependent current the symmetric expression .",
    "to derive an expression for the zero frequency noise , we insert the operator into the definition of the current - current correlation function and integrate over the times @xmath382 and @xmath47 .",
    "again , we employ the relation to bring @xmath383 into the symmetric form ."
