    "description of nature in quantum physics is significantly different from that in classical physics .",
    "there are several no - go results revealing the departure of quantum theory from classical theory , which arise from statistics obtained by performing measurements on any system .",
    "historically first no - go theorem is due to john bell @xcite in response to einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite which states that local - realist theory can not explain all the correlations obtained from local measurements on spatially separated entangled systems .",
    "second no - go theorem , due to kochen and specker @xcite , states that there is no non - contextual hidden variable theory for a class of temporal correlation obtained from sequential commutative measurements on a single quantum system .",
    "the latest no - go theorem in this direction is due to leggett and garg in the form of an inequality , namely the leggett - garg inequality ( lgi ) , which is a testable algebraic consequence of the notion of macrorealism ( mr ) @xcite .",
    "+ it is to be noted here that all these no - go theorems are demonstrated through doing measurements on quantum systems .",
    "measurements in quantum theory is another area where classical notion of measurement breaks down . in @xcite von",
    "neumann radically revised the theory of measurement in quantum mechanics . in this formulation quantum measurement",
    "is described by projective valued measure ( pvm ) .",
    "later this ideal notion of measurement i. e. , pvm is extended to incorporate realistic aspects of measurements , known as positive operator valued measure ( povm ) . the general description of quantum observables as povms gives rise to many operational possibilities not available within the set of standard observables ( represented as pvm ) .",
    "+ the impossibility of measuring jointly certain pairs of observables is an intriguing non - classical feature of quantum theory and another fundamental no - go theorem in the context of quantum measurement .",
    "it follows that for two non - commuting observables to be jointly measurable , it is necessary that both of them are unsharp .",
    "hence , there exists a trade - off between the degrees of non - commutativity and sharpness within the set of jointly measurable pairs of observables @xcite .",
    "later the joint measurability of pairs of qubit observables is analysed to study a trade - off between the degrees of joint measurability , sharpness and another quantity called biasedness @xcite .",
    "a two outcome experiment would be regarded as biased if one of the outcomes turned out to be preferred , whatever the preparation . + it was known that unsharpness of measurement reduces the possibility of observing quantum features . in a recent work @xcite trade - off between sharpness and biasedness has been explored by showing how biasedness of a measurement counters the effect of unsharpness in demonstrating violation of local realism and mr as well for relevant systems with minimal dimension .",
    "+ the task of extending measures of sharpness and biasedness to arbitrary hilbert spaces is not entirely trivial due to ambiguity and the fact that the 2-dimensional case is too simple to reveal relevant features . in this work",
    "we generalise the notion sharpness and biasedness measure for multilevel systems and investigate a trade - off between sharpness and biasedness for such systems in the context of the quantum mechanical ( qm ) violation of mr .",
    "+ apart from lgi , another two necessary conditions for testing mr , namely , wigner s form of the leggett - garg inequality ( wlgi ) @xcite and condition of no signalling in time ( nsit ) @xcite have been proposed .",
    "+ in the context of mr , povms has been introduced in the earlier works in association with emergence of classicality @xcite . in all these works",
    "it has been shown that magnitudes of qm violations of all the three necessary conditions of mr decrease with decreasing precision of measurements @xcite or decreasing values of sharpness parameter , i.e. , increasing unsharpness of the measurement @xcite . for probing violation of mr",
    "it is desired to consider systems with large quantum number like spin , large mass or large number of particles .",
    "+ in this work we explore the aforementioned trade - off for arbitrary spin system and find that for a fixed sharpness parameter the qm violation of mr increases with increasing biasedness of the measurements .",
    "+ in the following section , we explain in a nutshell the various necesesary conditions proposed for testing mr . in section iii , the notion of povm and the generalisation of biased unsharp measurement for multi - outcome spin measurement have been discussed . in section iv",
    ", the relevant features of the system and measurement scheme is discussed . in section",
    "v , the key results obtained using lgi , wlgi and nsit are discussed .",
    "finally we conclude in section vi mentioning directions for future studies .",
    "the concept of mr is codified by the following two assumptions : _ macroscopic realism per se : _ at any instant , a macroscopic system is in any one of the available definite states , regardless of any measurement , such that all its observable properties have definite values . _ noninvasive measurability ( nim ) : _ it is possible , in principle , to determine which of the states the system is in , without influencing the state itself or the system s evolution .",
    "+ qm violation of lgi gives a signature about the invalidity of the notion of mr , that implies the negation of the concept realism or nim or both in the underlying hidden variable theory reproducing all qm predictions .",
    "+ * leggett - garg inequality ( lgi ) * : it is derived as a testable algebraic consequence of the deterministic form of mr .",
    "let us consider temporal evolution for a two state system where the available states are , say , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an observable quantity such that , whenever measured , it is found to take a value @xmath3 depending on whether the system is in @xmath4 .",
    "next , consider a collection of sets of experimental runs , each set of runs starting from the identical initial state such that on the first set of runs @xmath5 is measured at times @xmath6 and @xmath7 , on the second at @xmath7 and @xmath8 and on the third at @xmath6 and @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "using the deterministic consequence of the assumptions of realism and nim , one obtains @xmath10 where @xmath11 = @xmath12 is the two time correlation function of the variable @xmath5 measured at times @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "left hand side of the inequality ( [ lgi ] ) is an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "this is the lgi imposing non - invasive realist constraint on the temporal correlations pertaining to any two level system .",
    "the magnitude of the qm violation of lgi is quantified by the positive value of @xmath15 . + * wigner s form of the lgi ( wlgi ) * : in @xcite , wlgi is derived as a testable algebraic consequence of the probabilistic form of mr . here the notion of realism implies the existence of overall joint probabilities @xmath16 pertaining to different combinations of definite values of observables or outcomes for the relevant measurements , while the assumption of nim implies that the probabilities of such outcomes would be unaffected by measurements .",
    "hence , by appropriate marginalization , the observable probabilities can be obtained .",
    "for example , the observable joint probability @xmath17 of obtaining the outcomes @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the sequential measurements of q at the instants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , can be written as @xmath22 @xmath23 writing similar expressions for the other measurable marginal joint probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we get @xmath26 @xmath27 then invoking non - negativity of the overall joint probabilities occurring on the right hand side of the above equation , the following form of wlgi is obtained in terms of three pairs of two - time joint probabilities .",
    "@xmath28 similarly , other forms of wlgi involving any number of pairs of two - time joint probabilities can be derived by using various combinations of the observable joint probabilities . the magnitude of the qm violation of wlgi is quantified by the positive value of @xmath29 . +",
    "* the condition of no signalling in time ( nsit ) * : the measurement outcome statistics for any observable at any instant is _ independent _ of whether any prior measurement has been performed @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system whose time evolution occurs between two possible states .",
    "probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath18 for the measurement of a dichotomic observable @xmath5 at an instant , say , @xmath21 _ without _ any earlier measurement being performed , is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "nsit requires that @xmath30 should remain _ unchanged _ even when an earlier measurement is made at @xmath20 .",
    "mathematically nsit can be expressed as an equation .",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 = 0\\ ] ] the magnitude of the qm violation of nsit is quantified by the nonzero value of @xmath33 .",
    "in projector valued measurement ( pvm ) the observables are self - adjoint operators with projectors as spectra , i.e. , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35s are projectors ) . the probability of getting the @xmath36-th outcome is @xmath37 $ ] for the state @xmath38 . extending to positive operator valued measures ( povm ) ,",
    "observables are self - adjoint operators but with spectra as positive operators within the interval @xmath39 $ ] like @xmath40 and probability of getting @xmath36-th outcome is @xmath41 $ ] .",

    "+ now consider sharp spin-@xmath50 component ( @xmath51 ) measurement on a multilevel ( @xmath52 dimension ) spin system , where the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of @xmath51 operator and are denoted by @xmath53 ( the possible values of @xmath53 are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , ... ,",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "the projectors onto the state which is a eigenstate of the sharp @xmath51 observable with eigenvalue @xmath53 is denoted by @xmath59 . here",
    "we generalize the effect operators corresponding to the biased unsharp povm in the following way @xmath60 now we have to check the conditions of positivity and normalization for these effect operators to form valid povm . +",
    "* completeness : * this condition is satisfied as all the effects sum to identity . @xmath61",
    "* positivity : * from the requirement of positivity of effects we get @xmath62 and @xmath63 these two inequalities imply that @xmath64 here lower and upper bounds are ` m ' dependent .",
    "to get ` m ' independent lower and upper bounds we can take @xmath65 as negative value of the sharpness parameter ( @xmath42 ) has no physical significance , we can consider the permissible range of @xmath42 as @xmath66 from the above mentioned range of @xmath42 , we get a bound for @xmath43 also .",
    "this is given by , @xmath67 hence , for multilevel systems we obtained the form of effect operators and the permissible ranges for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by inequalities ( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) respectively .    given the above specification of the effect operators ,",

    "+ here it should be noted that while for qubits  biased unsharp measurement \" @xcite is the most general kind of two outcome povm , for multilevel systems these two parameters do not constitute the most general unique form of povm but a reasonable one .",
    "now we describe briefly the projective measurement scheme introduced in @xcite , which is treated with sharpness and biasedness parameter in our calculations . consider a system of spin @xmath58 in an external uniform magnetic field of magnitude @xmath70 along the @xmath71 direction .",

    "+ the aforementioned grouping scheme ( call it one versus remaining ) is chosen as it leads to maximal possible violation of all the necessary conditions of mr @xcite .",
