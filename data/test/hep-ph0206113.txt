    "the recent observation suggesting that the fine - structure constant was smaller in the past  @xcite than it is today has led to renewed interest in the idea of using time ( and space ) variation of fundamental parameters as a probe of high - energy physics . based on the principle that all that is not forbidden is mandatory , time variation in the electromagnetic force is perhaps not surprising .",
    "moreover , one would expect that the other forces of nature vary with time as well .",
    "this idea is quantifiable by assuming a suitable grand unified theory ( gut ) at a scale @xmath0 or a particular brane - world scenario  @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the short - distance couplings of the theory are related at all times leads to relations between the variation of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction , @xmath1 , and the variation of other standard model parameters , such as the light quark masses , @xmath2 . as a change in @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "will naively lead to a change in the positions of nuclear energy levels , special interest has been paid to the light - element abundances predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and also to the abundance of isotopes produced by the oklo `` natural reactor '' in the hope that these abundances can be used to constrain high - energy physics  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will critically analyze the two - nucleon sector using an effective field theory ( eft ) that respects the approximate @xmath3 chiral symmetry of qcd and has consistent power - counting  @xcite .",
    "this theory allows for a systematic study , consistent with qcd , of the bound - state in the @xmath4 coupled - channels , the deuteron , and the scattering amplitude in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "this is the first study of the @xmath2-dependence of these quantities that is _ complete _ at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in a consistent eft .",
    "unfortunately , due to the current lack of understanding of the low - energy behavior of qcd , only weak bounds , if any , can be placed on the time - dependence of fundamental couplings from the two - nucleon sector .",
    "we will explicitly demonstrate this by finding plausible values for couplings in the eft for which the deuteron binding energy varies relatively little , and for which the di - neutron system in the @xmath5 channel is unbound , over a relatively wide range of quark masses .",
    "the deuteron is an interesting object to study for a variety of reasons . from a fundamental point of view",
    "it is quite intriguing as it is bound by only @xmath6 , which is much smaller than the typical scale of strong interactions , @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , in order to arrive at such a small binding energy , fine - tunings are involved   and the @xmath8 coupled - channels are very close to an unstable ir fixed point of the renormalization group . at this fixed point , the scattering lengths are infinite  @xcite . ] and consequently naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) as applied to the single - nucleon sector or the mesonic sector , which we will call naive naive dimensional analysis ( n@xmath9da ) , on this system is doomed to fail .",
    "unfortunately , all previous attempts to extract bounds on the variations of fundamental couplings from the deuteron , and in general the two - nucleon sector , have implemented n@xmath9da . from a more phenomenological standpoint",
    ", the smallness of @xmath10 plays a key role in the synthesis of light elements in bbn .",
    "the impressive agreement between the predictions of bbn and observation suggests that new physics that would have significantly modified the deuteron at the time of bbn is absent .",
    "the @xmath5 channel is quite similar to the @xmath4 coupled - channels in one important way , its scattering length is unnaturally large , @xmath11 .",
    "while there is no bound state in this channel for the physical values of the light - quark masses , a small increase in the strength of the nuclear force would bind two nucleons in this channel .",
    "the existence of a bound state in this channel , e.g. a di - neutron , @xmath12 , in the nucleosynthesis epoch would be quite profound and could substantially modify the predictions of bbn .",
    "during the last decade there has been a significant effort to construct an eft to describe nuclear physics . while it is straightforward to write down all possible terms in the effective lagrange density for two or more nucleons , arriving at the correct power - counting proved to be a difficult task .",
    "weinberg s ( w ) original proposal  @xcite for an eft describing multi - nucleon systems was to determine the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials using the organizational principles of the well - established eft s describing the meson - sector and single - nucleon sector ( chiral perturbation theory , @xmath13pt ) , and then to insert these potentials into the schrdinger equation to solve for nn wavefunctions .",
    "observables are computed as matrix elements of operators between these wavefunctions .",
    "w power - counting has been extensively and successfully developed during the past decade to study processes in the few - nucleon systems .",
    "this method is intrinsically numerical and is similar in spirit to traditional nuclear - physics potential theory .",
    "unfortunately , there are formal inconsistencies in w power - counting  @xcite , in particular , divergences that arise at leading order ( lo ) in the chiral expansion can not be absorbed by the lo operators .",
    "problems persists at all orders in the chiral expansion , and the correspondence between divergences and counterterms appears to be lost , leading to uncontrolled errors in the predictions for observables .",
    "this formal issue was partially resolved by kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw ) who introduced a power - counting in which pions are treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "the nn phase - shifts and mixing angle in the @xmath5 and @xmath4 coupled - channels have been computed to next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath9lo ) in the ksw expansion by fleming , mehen and stewart ( fms )  @xcite from which it can be concluded that the ksw expansion converges slowly in the @xmath5 channel and does not converge in the @xmath4 coupled - channels .",
    "therefore , neither w or ksw power - counting provide a complete description of nuclear interactions ( for recent reviews see ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the problems with w and ksw power - counting appear to have been resolved in the work by bedaque , van kolck and the authors  @xcite , which from this point on we will refer to as bbsvk .",
    "it was realized in fms that the contributions to the amplitude that lead to non - convergence in the @xmath4 coupled - channels persist in the chiral limit ( it is the chiral limit of iterated one - pion - exchange ( ope ) that is troublesome ) .",
    "therefore , in bbsvk power - counting the scattering amplitude is an expansion about the chiral limit .",
    "this recovers ksw power - counting in the @xmath5 channel , where fms found it to be slowly converging .",

    "it is possible that some of the traditional treatments of the nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite , and treatments of light nuclei could mimic these dependences by variations in their ad - hoc short - distance components of the nucleon - nucleon and higher - body potentials .",
    "the recently developed effective field theory tools organize this problem in a very simple way , and thus at nlo in the eft expansion , only the @xmath39 are needed . in experimental processes examined to date that , in principle , allow one to separate the @xmath39 from the @xmath38 , it is found that there are other amplitudes contributing to the process that dominate over the @xmath39 contributions , rendering such a separation exceedingly difficult . in the absence of an experimental determination of the @xmath39",
