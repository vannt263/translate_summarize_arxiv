    "a data base has been created combining 1100 days of  observations with batse , from jd 2448387 to 2449480 ( to ) .",
    "it includes observations of fast variability ( 0.010.488 hz ) as well as flux measurements ( ) and energy spectral fits .",
    "the goal of this work is to look for correlations between various parameters derived from power spectral , flux , and energy spectral measurements .",
    "this work is part of a larger on - going project to systematically study the power spectral behavior of all black - hole candidate sources observed with batse .    in section 2",
    "we describe the methods used for creating the power spectra and the results of the occultation analysis . in section 3",
    "we show that correlations occur between several quantities derived from the energy spectral and power spectral fits , and briefly discuss these results .",
    "the batse occultation analysis technique has been described elsewhere ( harmon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for this study ,",
    "the corrected detector count rates for  have been fit to a power law in the energy range 45140 kev , and a total flux ( photons @xmath0 ) has been calculated for the same energy band .",
    "typically 1530 measurements are made each day . from these data we produced daily averaged flux and photon spectral    to quantify the rapid variability , we have created power spectra from the 1.024 second time resolution large area detector ( lad ) count rate data , using two energy channels covering the range 2050 and 50100 kev .",
    "these data were filtered to eliminate bursts , then searched for segments with 512 contiguous time bins ( 524.288 seconds without gaps ) when the source was above the earth s limb .",
    "each segment was fit to a quadratic polynomial and the fit residuals converted to a power density spectrum ( pds ) using standard fast fourier transform techniques .",
    "the pds was normalized to squared fractional  amplitude per unit frequency , according to the method described by miyamoto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , using the raw daily averaged detector count rates in the 20100 kev energy band obtained from the occultation analysis .",
    "interference from other black hole candidate sources ( e.g. , , and ) was eliminated by selection of only those detectors in which these sources did not appear .",
    "using similar 524.288 second intervals obtained when the source was occulted by the earth , we have determined that the quadratic detrending of the raw data yields a background ( source occulted ) power level consistent with a pure poisson process for frequencies between 0.01 hz and the nyquist frequency ( 0.488 hz ) .",
    "the results obtained are consistent with those obtained using a full background model developed by rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    it is well known that the power spectrum of   has a characteristic shape ( belloni & hasinger @xcite ) ; the spectrum is flat below a break frequency , @xmath1 , and has a power law form above @xmath2 .",
    "we have attempted to parameterize the shape of these spectra by fitting to a function , p , of the form @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the amplitude of the low frequency part of the spectrum , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is related to the slope of the power spectrum just above the break frequency .",
    "figure 1 shows three randomly selected spectra and the fits obtained using this functional form .",
    "we also calculated the fractional  amplitude from the power spectral density for the frequency range .",
    "the three power spectral fit parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the fractional  amplitude , the the total flux , and photon power - law index were plotted against one another to study the relationships between these quantities . some of the results are shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "the strongest correlation is observed between the break frequency @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) and the  amplitude ( fig .",
    "the fractional  amplitude monotonically decreases as the @xmath2 increases .",
    "these observations are similar to the results of belloni & hasinger ( @xcite ) based on 13 observations from the exosat archive at lower energies ( @xmath9 220 kev ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of fractional  amplitude vs. spectral index of a power law fit in the 45140 kev band .",
    "a correlation is also seen in these data .",
    "the energy spectrum generally becomes softer as the  amplitude decreases .",
    "the fractional  amplitude is in the range 830% during these observations .",
    "the origin of this effect is not well understood .",
    "a more detailed study of the type presented here is in preparation .",
