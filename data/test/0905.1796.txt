    "cluster categories were defined in @xcite as tools for categorification of fomin - zelevinsky cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "they are defined as the orbit categories of the derived category @xmath0 of hereditary abelian categories @xmath1 by a certain autoequivalence .    in the situation where @xmath1 is the category of finite dimensional representations of a finite acyclic quiver ,",
    "the cluster category has been subject to intense investigation . in this case",
    "it has been shown that the cluster category and the set of exceptional objects form a good model for the cluster algebra associated with the same quiver .    in this paper",
    "we work with a cluster category @xmath2 defined from a different hereditary abelian category , namely the tube @xmath3 .",
    "this category is called the cluster tube and has recently been studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although this category is also a hom - finite triangulated 2-calabi - yau category , it does not admit all of the nice properties of cluster categories from quivers .",
    "in particular , the maximal rigid ( also called maximal exceptional ) objects do not satisfy the more restrictive definition of cluster - tilting objects",
    ".    moreover , the gabriel quivers of the endomorphism rings of maximal rigid objects in the cluster tube have loops .",
    "consequently , @xmath2 with its maximal rigid objects does not carry a cluster structure in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the axioms for cluster structures can be modified , however , to apply also to cluster tubes , see @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the endomorphism rings of the maximal rigid objects .",
    "we will find a description in terms of quivers with relations . like cluster - tilted algebras ,",
    "the algebras we consider here are gorenstein of gorenstein dimension 1 , unless @xmath4 , in which case they are self - injective . however , the proof ( from @xcite ) for cluster - tilted algebras has no analogy in our setting .",
    "instead , we use the fact that our algebras are gentle , and apply the technique from @xcite to our quivers with relations in order to prove the result",
    ". the properties of the algebras we study in this paper are thus reminiscent of those of the algebras recently studied in @xcite .",
    "since the endomorphism rings are gentle , they are string algebras .",
    "we use the theory of string- and band - modules to show that the endomorphism rings are of finite type .",
    "one of the main results about cluster - tilted algebras , which was proved in @xcite , is the close connection between the module category of the cluster - tilted algebra and the cluster category it arises from .",
    "this connection is provided by the hom - functor .",
    "in our situation , the hom - functor is not full , and therefore there is no analogous theorem .",
    "we will nevertheless study the action of the hom - functor on the objects , and in particular show that it is dense .",
    "indeed , when @xmath5 is maximal rigid , we find an explicit description of @xmath6 for every indecomposable @xmath7 in @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section [ sec : objects ] contains the definition of the cluster tube and a description of maximal rigid objects recalled from @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : endoring ] we give the description of the endomorphism rings , before we in section [ sec : gentle ] study the gentleness and gorenstein dimension and give some facts about indecomposable representations .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : homfunctor ] we describe the action of the hom - functor .    throughout the paper we will work over some field @xmath8 , which is assumed to be algebraically closed .",
    "modules over an algebra will always mean left modules , and we will read paths in quivers from right to left .",
    "we start off by reviewing some properties of cluster tubes .",
    "these categories have recently been studied in @xcite and @xcite , and more details can be found in these papers .    for any integer @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a tube of rank @xmath10 , that is , the category of nilpotent representations of a cyclically oriented @xmath11-quiver .",
    "it can also be realised as the thick subcategory generated by a tube in the regular component in the ar - quiver of a suitable tame hereditary algebra .",
    "all maps in this category are linear combinations of finite compositions of irreducible maps , and are subject to mesh relations in the ar - quiver .",
    "@xmath3 is a hereditary abelian category , and following the construction introduced in @xcite , we form its cluster category , called the _",
    "cluster tube of rank @xmath10 _ and denoted @xmath2 .",
    "this is by definition the orbit category obtained from the bounded derived category @xmath12 by the action of the self - equivalence @xmath13 $ ] . here ,",
    "@xmath14 $ ] denotes the suspension functor of @xmath15 , while @xmath16 is the auslander - reiten translation . unless the actual value of @xmath10 is important",
    ", we will usually suppress the subscript @xmath10 in the notation , and write @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for a finite - dimensional hereditary algebra @xmath20 , a theorem due to keller @xcite guarantees that the associated cluster category @xmath21 is triangulated with a canonical triangulated structure inherited from the derived category .",
    "keller s result is not directly applicable in our situation , since @xmath17 has no tilting objects .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath2 also inherits a triangulated structure from @xmath15 , see @xcite for a rigorous treatment of this .",
    "the indecomposable objects of the cluster tube @xmath19 are in bijection with the indecomposables in @xmath17 itself , and we will sometimes use the same symbol to denote both an object in the tube @xmath17 and its image in the cluster tube @xmath19 .",
    "the irreducible maps in @xmath19 are the images of the irreducible maps in @xmath18 , which again are the shifts of the irreducible maps in the tube @xmath17 .",
    "so the ar - quiver of @xmath19 is isomorphic to the ar - quiver of @xmath17 .    for a given rank @xmath10",
    ", we will use a coordinate system on the indecomposable objects .",

    "now give the other quasisimples coordinates @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is reduced modulo the rank @xmath10",
    ". then give the remaining indecomposables coordinates @xmath26 in such a way that there are irreducible morphisms @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",

    "since @xmath17 is hereditary , all maps in @xmath19 are linear combinations of maps of these two kinds .",
    "the hom - hammock of an indecomposable object ( that is , the support of @xmath48 ) is illustrated in figure [ figure : homhammock ] .",
    "note that the two components in the figure wrap around the tube and intersect . moreover , if @xmath49 , then each component intersects itself , possibly with several layers , and therefore there exist hom - spaces of arbitrary finite dimension between indecomposables .    .",

    "( i ) : * we lift the maps to the derived category @xmath18 , and denote by @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 the preimages of the objects in @xmath17 . since @xmath7 and @xmath41 have quasilength @xmath66 , we have that the space @xmath67)$ ] of @xmath18-maps is at most one - dimensional for any indecomposable @xmath68 , and similarly for @xmath41 .",

    "we can view this as a map @xmath70 or , by duality and the ar - formula , @xmath71 which we now wish to show is injective .",

    "similarly as above , by duality this is equivalent to the map @xmath73 being injective .",
    "but by the combinatorics of the tube , this is clearly an isomorphism , since by assumption both spaces are 1-dimensional .",
    "let @xmath74 , and choose some indecomposable @xmath7 in @xmath3 with quasilength @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be a linearly oriented quiver with underlying graph the dynkin diagram @xmath77 .",
    "then the category @xmath78 of finitely generated modules over the path algebra @xmath79 is naturally equivalent with the subcategory @xmath80 of @xmath3 .",

    "the image is the subcategory @xmath82 obtained by deleting the @xmath18-maps from @xmath83 . from now on , we will drop the subscript when we speak of an additive hull as a set of objects , since there is a bijection between the objects of @xmath17 and those of @xmath19 .    the triangulated category @xmath19 is a 2-calabi - yau category , which in particular means that for any two objects @xmath7 and @xmath41 , we have symmetric ext - spaces : @xmath84 two indecomposable objects @xmath7 and @xmath41 will be called _ compatible _ if @xmath85 .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath7 and @xmath41 are compatible if and only if @xmath86 .    in an abelian or triangulated category @xmath87 , an object @xmath5",

    "the following description of the maximal rigid objects was given in @xcite :    [ prop : tiltedbijection ] there is a natural bijection between the set of maximal rigid objects in @xmath2 and the set @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a linearly oriented quiver with the dynkin diagram @xmath93 as its underlying graph .",
    "the proposition follows from the following considerations , which will be needed for the rest of the paper : all summands of a maximal rigid object in @xmath2 are concentrated in the wing @xmath94 determined by a",
    "_ top summand _ @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "now the claim follows from the embedding of @xmath97 into @xmath98 , since it is easily seen that @xmath99 for two indecomposables @xmath7 and @xmath41 in @xmath94 vanishes if and only if both @xmath100 and @xmath101 vanish , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the corresponding @xmath104-modules .",
    "since there are @xmath10 choices for the top summand , this provides the bijection .",
    "with the description of the maximal rigid objects of @xmath19 presented in section [ sec : objects ] , we now proceed to determine their endomorphism rings in terms of quivers and relations .",
    "let @xmath5 be a maximal rigid object in the cluster tube @xmath2 , and let @xmath105 denote the tilting @xmath104-module associated with @xmath5 according to proposition [ prop : tiltedbijection ] .",
    "since the module category of a hereditary algebra @xmath20 sits naturally embedded in the cluster category @xmath21 , we can think of the module @xmath105 as a cluster - tilting object in @xmath106 .",
    "the endomorphism ring , or cluster - tilted algebra , @xmath107 can easily be found from the tilted algebra @xmath108 , by the results in @xcite , or more generally in @xcite .",
    "every minimal relation on the quiver of a tilted algebra of type @xmath109 is a zero relation of length two .",
    "the quiver of the cluster - tilted algebra is then obtained by inserting an arrow @xmath110 from the end vertex to the start vertex of each defining relation path @xmath111 .",
    "the relations for the cluster - tilted algebra are , as prescribed by @xcite , the compositions of any two arrows in any of the 3-cycles formed by adding the new arrows .",
    "we can now formulate the main theorem of this section .",

    "let @xmath623 be the idempotent of @xmath267 corresponding to the vertex @xmath204 , which again corresponds to the summand @xmath230 of @xmath5 .",
    "then the vector space @xmath625 decomposes @xmath626 where each vector space @xmath627 and @xmath628 is at most 1-dimensional and is spanned by a @xmath17-map @xmath629 and a @xmath18-map @xmath630 respectively , where these maps are zero if no non - zero such maps exist .    by the definition of @xmath561 , the vertices",
    "for which @xmath631 are exactly the vertices that are traversed by @xmath561 .",
    "similarly , the vertices for which @xmath632 are the ones traversed by @xmath576 .",
    "in particular , there is an equality of dimension vectors @xmath633    we need to establish that the action of @xmath267 on @xmath625 is the same as the action on @xmath617 .",
    "each map which is irreducible in @xmath238 corresponds to an arrow in the quiver of @xmath267 , and the arrow acts by composition with the irreducible map .",
    "unless both the start vertex and the end vertex of this arrow are vertices in the support of @xmath625 , then clearly this map ( equivalently , this arrow ) has a zero action on both the modules @xmath620 and @xmath617 .",
    "so we must show that for each @xmath17-arrow @xmath634 appearing in @xmath561 acts by an isomorphism @xmath635 , and each @xmath17-arrow appearing in @xmath576 acts by an isomorphism @xmath636 , and finally that if @xmath637 is defined , then the action of this is given by an isomorphism @xmath638 .",
    "our first goal is now to show that whenever @xmath639 is a @xmath17-arrow such that @xmath360 itself or @xmath377 appears in @xmath640 , then the action of @xmath360 is given by a pair of linear transformations @xmath641 which are isomorphisms when their domains and codomains are both non - zero .",
    "( and necessarily zero otherwise . ) let @xmath642 be the irreducible @xmath17-map corresponding to @xmath360 .",
    "then what we need is that if @xmath643 and @xmath644 are both non - zero , then @xmath645 up to a non - zero scalar , and similarly that if @xmath646 and @xmath647 are both non - zero , then @xmath648 .",
    "the first assertion is clearly true by the structure of the tube .",
    "the second assertion holds by an application of lemma [ lem : rayfactoring ] part ( i ) , and remark [ rem : rayfactoring ] , where we use that @xmath649 must be a composition of maps which are irreducible in @xmath650 , and follows a ray or coray ( along the edge of a wing ) , and thus all the indecomposables that @xmath649 factors through are also in @xmath480 .",
    "next let @xmath7 be such that the @xmath18-arrow @xmath651 is defined , and thus appears in the string @xmath640 .",
    "then we know that @xmath627 and @xmath652 are non - zero .",
    "the action of @xmath577 is given by composition with a @xmath18-map @xmath653 .",
    "we wish to show that ( up to multiplication by a non - zero scalar ) this action is given by a linear transformation @xmath654 in other words , it sends @xmath644 to @xmath647 and annihilates @xmath646 .",
    "the composition @xmath655 is clearly zero , as all compositions of two @xmath18-maps are .",
    "consider the image @xmath656 of @xmath644 .",
    "we need that the @xmath17-map @xmath644 does not factor through any indecomposable to which there is no @xmath18-map from @xmath213 .",
    "this holds , since by lemma [ lem : onecomponent ] , @xmath657 forms a rectangle - shaped subgraph of the tube , and the map @xmath644 can not factor through any indecomposable outside this subgraph .",
    "we can then conclude from lemma [ lem : rayfactoring ] part ( ii ) and remark [ rem : rayfactoring ] that @xmath658 , which is what we wanted .",
    "it remains to show that if there exists an arrow which connects two vertices in the support of @xmath620 , but which does nt appear in @xmath640 , then the action of this arrow is zero on @xmath620 . by lemmas [ lem : stringsubwing ] , [ lem : revhamm ] and [ lem : dstrings ]",
    "the only case to consider is when @xmath577 is the loop vertex , and there is a @xmath5-subwing triple @xmath235 such that @xmath659 and @xmath660 or vice versa . since the action of the arrow @xmath661 is given by composition with the @xmath18-map @xmath662 , we only need to study the case where @xmath561 traverses @xmath405 and @xmath576 traverses @xmath8 .",
    "so we need to show that @xmath663 is zero .",
    "but by examining the hom - hammocks of @xmath213 and @xmath174 , we see that if there is a @xmath17-map @xmath664 and a @xmath18-map @xmath665 , then either @xmath7 is in @xmath224 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath204 must be traversed by @xmath640 , or @xmath644 factors through objects on the coray @xmath666 . in the latter case ,",
    "the composition must be zero , since there are no @xmath18-maps from @xmath174 to any objects on this coray .    *",
    "( 2 ) * counting the number of elements of @xmath487 , we find that it contains @xmath667 objects with quasilength less than @xmath10 and @xmath668 with quasilength @xmath10 or more , that is , a total of @xmath669 elements .",
    "since @xmath5 has @xmath189 summands , the cardinality of @xmath670 is @xmath671 which , by theorem [ thm : finitetype ] , is also the number of indecomposables in @xmath672 . by lemmas [ lem : differentstrings ] and [ lem : tstringisnotdstring ] , if @xmath7 and @xmath41 are different objects in @xmath673 , then @xmath674 .",
    "it then follows from part ( 1 ) that @xmath675 .",
    "so we @xmath621 provides a bijection .",
    "we now turn to the indecomposables which are not in @xmath487 .",
    "it is easily seen that lemma [ lem : revhamm ] parts ( ii)-(iv ) hold also for indecomposables which are not in @xmath487 .",
    "so we can define @xmath561 and @xmath576 in this case as well .",
    "the following theorem now completes the description of the action of @xmath621 on objects .",
    "let @xmath7 be an indecomposable object in @xmath19 , where @xmath676 .",
    "then we have the following .",
    "* @xmath503 if and only if @xmath677 , where @xmath678 . * if @xmath7 is not of the type described in @xmath679 , then @xmath680 where @xmath389 is the zero module if @xmath390 is the zero string .    *",
    "( 1 ) : * when @xmath676 we know that @xmath503 if and only if @xmath681 .",
    "there are no @xmath17-maps @xmath579 if and only if @xmath7 is on the ray @xmath581 , that is @xmath682 for some @xmath683 . moreover , there are no @xmath18-maps @xmath579 if and only if @xmath7 is on the coray @xmath684 .",
    "the indecomposables that are in the intersection of @xmath581 and @xmath684 and outside @xmath487 are exactly the ones with coordinates @xmath685 such that @xmath686 .",
    "the claim follows .    * ( 2 ) : * the proof of theorem [ thm : actiononf ] goes through , with the following exception , which is exactly what is needed .",
    "the action of @xmath577 ( which in this case is always the loop , as we see from the argument for ( 1 ) above ) is zero : the @xmath17-map @xmath687 factors through ( at least ) one object on the coray @xmath684 .",
    "we know that there are no @xmath18-maps from @xmath95 to any object on this coray .",
    "it then follows that the composition @xmath688 , where @xmath689 is the @xmath18-endomorphism of @xmath95 , is a zero map .",
