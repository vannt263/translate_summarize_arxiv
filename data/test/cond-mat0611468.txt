    "<S> we study the effect of electron - electron interactions in the electronic properties of a biased graphene bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> this system is a semiconductor with conduction and valence bands characterized by an unusual `` mexican - hat '' dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the metallic regime where the chemical potential lies in the `` mexican - hat '' in the conduction band , leading to a topologically non - trivial fermi surface in the shape of a ring . </S>",
    "<S> we show that due to the unusual topology of the fermi surface electron - electron interactions are greatly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ferromagnetic instability can occur provided a low density of carriers . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the electronic polarization function in the random phase approximation and show that , while at low energies the system behaves as a fermi liquid ( albeit with peculiar friedel oscillations ) , at high frequencies it shows a highly anomalous response when compare to ordinary metals . </S>"
