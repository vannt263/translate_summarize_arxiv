    "complex networks are ubiquitous  @xcite .",
    "they are seen in phenomena studied by physicists from resistor networks to polymer contact structure to spin interactions in disordered systems  @xcite , in engineered systems ( e.g. , the internet and the power grid ) and in the biological world from the intra - cellular signaling system to neuronal networks to ecological food webs  @xcite .",
    "analysis of such networks can lead not only to fundamental understanding of how complex systems function , but may also have immediate practical relevance .",
    "for example , understanding the network of intra - cellular communication leading to identification of the key players can result in developing drugs targeted specifically towards these molecules  @xcite . on a much larger scale , by revealing how the contact structure among susceptible and infected individuals govern the propagation of epidemics ,",
    "the manipulation of networks may play a significant role in public health .    beginning in 1998 - 99 , over the last decade interest in complex networks",
    "has grown by leaps and bounds among physicists .",
    "however , the focus of research activity related to such systems has been on either the microscopic properties of individual nodes such as the distribution of degree ( i.e. , the number of links for a node )  @xcite or the macroscopic properties characterizing the entire network in terms of a global value , such as average path length or clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "recent research , on the other hand , has revealed that networks which are indistinguishable at either of these two scales may nevertheless have radically different behavior  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this difference lies in their mesoscopic organization which can be structurally manifested as patterns in the arrangement of links between subparts of the network  @xcite .",
    "one of the prominent examples of such organizing principles operating in networks is the existence of communities , also referred to as _",
    "modularity _  @xcite .",
    "modules can be defined as subnetworks whose components are much more densely and/or strongly connected with each other as compared to connections with components that belong to different subnetworks . in earlier work",
    "we have shown that existence of modules can give rise to two distinct time - scales for the dynamics on such networks : a strongly modular character of the system , as indicated by a low value for the ratio of within - module to between - module connections , results in a sharp distinction between fast intra - modular and slower inter - modular processes  @xcite .",
    "another mesoscopic organizing principle observed in many networks is _ hierarchy _ ,",
    "i.e. , an arrangement in which entities are ordered in several levels or layers  @xcite .",
    "we are most familiar with hierarchy as seen in social organization ; however , they are also present in other systems , as for example in the neuronal communication network which has a clearly defined direction of information flow , beginning with the sensory organs and culminating with motor response . while both modular and hierarchical features are increasingly being reported in a wide range of systems , it is still not clear what role such patterns play in the dynamics and function of the corresponding systems . thus , the second wave of research in complex networks that is just beginning focuses on these mesoscopic aspects of networks",
    ".    there can be even more complicated intermediate - scale features in networks , in particular , hierarchically nested modularity , where modules and meta - modules ( composed of multiple strongly connected modules ) may occur at different hierarchical levels .",
    "such hierarchical modularity has been observed in many naturally occurring systems , including biological metabolic networks  @xcite , ecological food webs  @xcite , social groups  @xcite , financial markets  @xcite and brain functional networks  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]  ( a - b ) shows empirical evidence for the occurrence of hierarchical modular organization in the network of connections between cortical regions in the cat  @xcite and macaque  @xcite brains obtained from anatomical studies . theoretical understanding of such systems is still at an early stage .",
    "a simple - minded deterministic construction approach towards such networks claimed that such structures have a specific signature in the power law dependence of the clustering coefficient of nodes having degree @xmath0 on @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated , using simple counter - examples , that this is true only for a very specific set of artificially generated networks and does not hold in general  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the importance of acquiring a clearer understanding of the properties that the hierarchical nesting of modular structures impart to a system .",
    "we focus specifically on the role that such mesoscopic organization plays in synchronization dynamics on the network .    in this paper",
    "we show that in a hierarchical modular network of oscillators arranged into @xmath1 levels , there exist @xmath2 distinct time - scales of the synchronization dynamics .",
    "the oscillators belonging to the elementary modules ( @xmath3 ) synchronize earliest , followed by those belonging to the same meta - module ( @xmath4 ) and so on , with global synchronization being achieved last  . in the next section",
    "we discuss the simple network model with hierarchically nested modules which we have used .",
    "our results on the synchronization dynamics on such a network are described in section 3 .",
    "we have carried out spectral analysis of the laplacian matrix for the network to give a theoretical background for the explicit numerical simulations .",
    "we conclude with a short discussion on the possible functional relevance for the separation of time - scales through hierarchical modular organization in the biological world .",
    "we have used a general model for networks having modular organization at several hierarchically arranged levels that has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]  ( c ) ] . at the lowest level ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the network consists of @xmath6 modules , each containing @xmath7 nodes .",
    "the connectivity , or , the probability of a link , between a pair of nodes is much higher for nodes belonging to the same module compared to those belonging to different modules .",
    "let us assume the connectivity within each of the modules to be @xmath8 .",
    "we now introduce the next hierarchical level ( @xmath4 ) by grouping together @xmath9 modules into  meta - modules \" .",
    "the connection density between nodes belonging to different modules in the same meta - module is @xmath10 .",
    "thus , while the oscillators in the different modules within each of the @xmath11 meta - modules have a lower probability of connection ( @xmath12 ) between them as compared to the probability of connections between oscillators in the same module ( @xmath13 ) , it is higher than the connectivity for oscillators belonging to different meta - modules . to increase the number of hierarchical levels to three , we group @xmath14 such meta - modules into",
    " meta - meta - modules \" ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the connectivity between oscillators belonging to different meta - modules but in the same meta - meta - module is @xmath16 .",
    "this procedure of grouping together @xmath14 clusters of oscillators at higher and higher levels of organization can be continued upto a maximum number of layers , @xmath2 , implicitly given by the relation @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is the branching at each level ( except the lowest one ) , corresponding to the number of clusters at one level that are grouped together to form the cluster at the next higher level .    to reduce the number of model parameters",
    ", we further assume that the connectivities within and between clusters at different levels , @xmath18 are related as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ratio of inter - cluster connectivities at two successive hierarchical levels .",
    "varying @xmath21 from 0 to 1 , one obtains a whole range of hierarchical modular networks , with the special case of @xmath6 isolated modules at one extreme ( @xmath22 ) and a homogeneous erdos - renyi random network at the other ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ]  ( c ) shows an example of a hierarchical network with 3 levels and @xmath24 constructed following the above procedure .",
    "the model allows the modular character of the network to be changed ( by varying @xmath21 ) independent of the hierarchical complexity which is governed by the number of levels , @xmath2 .",
    "the stochastic construction process of the network implies that reasonable statistical averages can be done over an ensemble of random networks with the same hierarchical modularity .",
    "most networks occurring in nature have dynamics associated with their nodes  @xcite . in particular , many systems comprise oscillating elements , such as , pancreatic beta cells , neurons or cardiac pacemaker cells  @xcite .",
    "synchronization of the periodic activity exhibited by the nodes in such networks may play a vital functional role . to observe how the hierarchical modular organization of a network can affect its synchronization behavior ,",
    "we consider a population of @xmath25 coupled oscillators .",
    "the time - evolution of the phase of the @xmath26-th oscillator having a frequency @xmath27 and which is connected to @xmath28 other oscillators , can be described by  @xcite : @xmath29 the coupling between the different oscillators is described by the matrix * k * = @xmath30*a * , where @xmath31 is the strength of interaction between the oscillators and * a * is the network adjacency matrix , i.e. , @xmath32 if nodes @xmath33 are connected , and 0 otherwise . in our analysis , we will mostly consider the simplified case of oscillators with identical frequency , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "however , we have explicitly verified that randomly varying the frequencies of different oscillators over a small range do not qualitatively affect our results .",
    "the attractor for the network dynamics described by eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] is the fully synchronized state @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "however , for a network with mesoscopic organization , the convergence to global synchronization occurs in a series of steps which is intrinsically related to the underlying connection topology ( and has been seen earlier in simple modular networks  @xcite ) .",
    "we observe that , starting from a random distribution of initial phases for the different oscillators , the nodes within each module synchronize first , followed by larger and larger structures at the higher hierarchical levels in sequence till the entire system oscillates in the same phase .",
    "the distinct time - scales of synchronization for the different levels reflect the structural organization of the network .    to analyze the time evolution of the synchronization process , we measure a local order parameter using the pair - correlation function between the oscillator phases : @xmath37 \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is an average over random initial phases . introducing a threshold @xmath39 , the correlation matrix is converted into a dynamic connectivity matrix @xmath40 , where @xmath41 if @xmath42 and @xmath43 otherwise .",
    "the number of distinct synchronized communities at any given time is given by the number of disconnected clusters in @xmath44 .",
    "initially , when the phases of the oscillators are chosen from a random distribution , none of the elements are synchronized and the number of clusters is trivially equal to the number of oscillators , @xmath25 . however , with time , more and more oscillators get successively synchronized and when global synchronization is achieved , there is only a single cluster of synchronized elements .",
    "in contrast to homogeneous random networks , where there is a smooth , continuous transition to global synchronization with time , for a hierarchical modular network we observe a series of step - like transitions as larger and larger clusters get synchronized at different time - scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .        for a network having @xmath2 hierarchical levels",
    ", the evolution to global synchronization exhibits @xmath2 intermediate time - scales as reflected by the occurrence of @xmath2 plateaus between @xmath25 and 1 for the number of synchronized clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "first , at the relatively short time - scale of @xmath45 , disconnected clusters are observed to form in @xmath44 which correspond to the modules at the lowest hierarchical level of the network .",
    "thus , local synchronization within each module at level @xmath3 is achieved relatively rapidly .",
    "next , at a slightly longer time - scale of @xmath46 , several of the clusters mentioned earlier merge into bigger clusters corresponding to the meta - modules at the next hierarchical level @xmath47 of the network .",
    "therefore , the intermediate - scale synchronization over meta - modules is a slower process than the local synchronization seen within each module , the initially synchronized clusters remaining fairly stable in the intervening time - period between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "successive hierarchical levels take longer and longer times to synchronize , and we can associate distinct synchronization time - scales @xmath48 with each such level . finally , global synchronization is observed at the longest time - scale of @xmath49 .    as the existence of the distinct time - scales to synchronization is a result of the mesoscopic organization of the network",
    ", we expect that as the system becomes more homogeneous on increasing @xmath21 , the different time - scales should converge towards the same value .",
    "this is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where the three time - scales for @xmath50 , viz . , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath49 approach each other as @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of the distinct time - scales in a hierarchical modular network can be understood by analyzing the linearized dynamics around the synchronized state of the system : @xmath52 where * l * is the laplacian of the network , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "solving eq .",
    "[ eq : lap ] in terms of the normal modes @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the eigenvalues of * l@xmath59 = d@xmath60",
    "l * with * d * being a diagonal matrix having @xmath61 .",
    "all the eigenvalues of * l@xmath59 * are real as the matrix is related to the symmetric normalized laplacian * d@xmath62 l@xmath59 d@xmath63 * through a similarity transformation .",
    "any difference in time - scales of the different modes is manifested as gaps in the spectrum of this laplacian , and reveals different levels of mesoscopic organization in the network .",
    "the mode corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue is associated with global synchronization .",
    "the other modes provide information about collective behavior within different groups of oscillators . typically , the size of the clusters considered decrease with increasing value of the corresponding eigenvalues .        in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ]  ( a ) we observe multiple gaps in the laplacian spectrum for a hierarchical network , the number of gaps corresponding exactly to the number of hierarchical levels ( @xmath64 ) indicating that the existence of several distinct time - scales for the dynamical system has its origin in the hierarchical modular nature . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]  ( b ) , the width of the gaps increase with decreasing value of @xmath21 , suggesting that the time - scales become more differentiated with increasing modularity , i.e. , decreasing connectivity between the modules , between the meta - modules , and so on .",
    "in this paper we have generalized our earlier result for time - scale separation of dynamics on simple modular networks by showing that for a system with hierarchically nested modules occurring at multiple levels , there exists a number of distinct time - scales ( equal to the number of hierarchical levels ) .",
    "any collective dynamical process taking place on such a system ( e.g. , coordination of nodal activity ) will occur at many different temporal rates , the fastest events taking place at the lowest modular level and the slowest occurring at the global level .",
    "an important point to note is that the non - uniform synchronization observed in our system is rooted in its non - trivial mesoscopic organization .",
    "this distinguishes the behavior from the  hierarchical \" synchronization observed in homogeneous scale - free networks , where oscillators having more connections ( i.e. , higher degree ) show stronger phase - locking between them  @xcite .",
    "thus , the latter phenomenon is related to the dispersion of microscopic properties ( viz . ,",
    "degree ) of the nodes , which by design is identical for all oscillators in our system .",
    "an interesting topic for future study is the effect of different varieties of degree distribution on synchronization dynamics in hierarchical modular networks .",
    "our results also have ramifications for the evolution of such mesoscopic organization in natural systems such as the brain .",
    "while synchronization of activity among elements belonging to the same cluster may have functional relevance , global synchronization of the system is often pathological and detrimental to the system  @xcite .",
    "thus , the occurrence of a hierarchically nested modular organization may be nature s way to allow rapid local synchronization at small scales while making it difficult for activity in the system as a whole to get coordinated .",
    "note that this possible functional role of hierarchical modularity in the brain is distinct from the recent suggestion that it is related to the task of simultaneously segregating sensory signals and integrating information from multiple channels in the brain , as the latter requires the existence of hubs ( i.e. , nodes having a much higher number of connections than the average , which by design is absent in our model ) in addition to the modular and hierarchical nature of cortico - cortical connections  @xcite .",
    "we have earlier demonstrated that the occurrence of modularity in the _ c. elegans _ nervous system may be directly related to the functional requirement of information processing  @xcite",
    ". a recent study of hopfield - like associative memory models has also shown that modular network structure alters the attractor landscape of convergence dynamics in such systems , making the recall of stored patterns more efficient  @xcite .",
    "generalizing these results to modules at more than one level should bring us closer to answering the question as to why hierarchical modularity is ubiquitous in the biological world .",
