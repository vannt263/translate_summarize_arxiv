    "almost a century ago , in their pioneering research @xcite , kaluza and klein ( kk ) proposed unification of four dimensional gravity and electromagnetism in a five dimensional gravity framework .",
    "this proposal raised a fair amount of curiosity , interest and research activity among theoretical physicists , on the physics of extra dimensions .",
    "the idea of extra spatial dimensions appeared in a new incarnation with the advent of superstring theories @xcite .",
    "the theoretical existence of branes in string theory eventually motivated the hypothesis that we may be living on an embedded , timelike submanifold ( the brane ) of a higher dimensional ( @xmath0 ) lorentzian spacetime ( warped or unwarped ) , as assumed in the so - called arkani - hamed ",
    "dvali  dimopoulos ( add ) @xcite and randall  sundrum ( rs ) @xcite braneworld models .",
    "the seminal work of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite on warped braneworlds , published more than a decade ago , refers to the idea of the scale of the extra dimension being spacetime dependent , while addressing the issue of stability , in a two - brane scenario . in a single brane scenario or from a purely higher dimensional bulk perspective ,",
    "the space - time dependence of the metric function(s ) associated with the extra dimensional coordinate(s ) basically imply that the scale of the extra dimension depends on the on - brane ( four dimensional ) spacetime coordinates . except for a brief discussion on rs type models",
    ", we shall , in this article , mostly work with the single brane scenario and a five dimensional bulk .    in earlier papers @xcite , geodesics in warped spacetimes",
    "have been investigated in detail .",
    "however , such a study of geodesics alone can not tell us about the overall local behavior of a family of test particles , as observed in the neighbourhood of a freely falling observer .",
    "this motivates us to study the evolution of geodesic congruences . since the appearance of _ raychaudhuri equations",
    ", in 1955 @xcite , relativists have discussed and analysed its implications in various contexts . in its original incarnation , the raychaudhuri equations provided the basis for the analysis of spacetime singularities in gravitation and cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , the equation for the expansion and the resulting theorem on geodesic focusing , is a crucial ingredient in the proofs of penrose - hawking singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of geodesic congruences is characterised by three kinematical quantities : isotropic expansion , shear and rotation ( henceforth referred as esr ) @xcite , which evolve along the flow according to the raychaudhuri equations . though mostly quoted and used in the context of gravity , these equations by virtue of their geometric nature , have a much wider scope in studying geodesic as well as non - geodesic flows in nature , which may possibly arise in diverse contexts ( see @xcite for some open issues ) .",
    "two of the authors here have recently used these equations to investigate the kinematics of geodesic flows in stringy black hole spacetimes @xcite and flows on flat and curved deformable media ( including elastic and viscoelastic media ) in detail @xcite .    in this article , we attempt to understand the kinematics of geodesic flows in five dimensional warped bulk spacetimes with and without branes . in section",
    "ii we quickly recall the background spacetime geometries and geodesics .",
    "section iiia analyses flows in the rs geometry with and without branes .",
    "the esr , as obtained from definitions , for a background with a thick brane are discussed in section iiib .",
    "numerical solutions of the geodesic and raychaudhuri equations are presented in iiic .",
    "finally , section iv contains our conclusions and comments .",
    "the bulk spacetimes we work with are given by the line element @xcite ( @xmath1 is the conformal time ) , @xmath2 + b^2(\\eta ) d\\sigma^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : cmetric}\\ ] ] table [ tab : models ] , shows the chosen functional forms of @xmath3 ( the warp factor ) , the cosmological [ @xmath4 and extra dimensional [ @xmath5 scale factors ( following @xcite ) .",
    ".the four possible combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we began by considering geodesic flows in the rs background . without branes congruence singularities",
    "always occur whereas with two branes , the expansion profile indicates how focusing / defocusing can occur in the spacetime between the branes .",
    "later , we analyse geodesic flows in a bulk geometry with a thick brane . using first integrals of geodesic motion ,",
    "analytic expressions for the kinematic variables are obtained .",
    "we show how differences arise as we change the warp factor from growing to decaying or when we do not have any warping but retain the time - evolving cosmological and extra dimensional scales .",
    "further , we numerically solve the raychaudhuri and geodesic equations to obtain the expansion , shear , rotation and demonstrate the role of initial conditions on their evolution . with @xmath8",
    ", a growing warp factor leads to a finite @xmath1 ( and @xmath9 ) congruence singularity whereas for a decaying warp factor , geodesics are focused at @xmath1 ( and @xmath9 ) @xmath10 . for a de sitter universe , a decaying warp factor may fail to focus the geodesics ( due to the large negativity of the curvature term in the raychaudhuri equation ) , though this is not the case with a growing warp factor .",
    "when the curvature effect is relatively small , a congruence singularity can still arise but for high enough negative initial expansion .",
    "the effect of initial rotation , on the esr profiles , especially the expansion scalar , is found to be quantitative .",
    "focusing without and with initial rotation yields similar results , though with large initial rotation , geodesics tend to spread for a while ( focusing at larger @xmath11 value ) .",
    "all our conclusions are summarised in table [ summary - table ] .    for a visual perspective",
    ", we have shown snap - shots of the evolution of a square element orthogonal to a geodesic congruence , from a local observer s point of view .",
    "the evolution of the expansion , shear and rotation , along the congruences become more explicit through these figures .",
    "the effect of @xmath7 seems to be largely quantitative since , in our models , as @xmath11 evolves @xmath7 tends to a static value with a deceleration .",
    "it may be asked ",
    "what relevance , if any , does a congruence singularity have in the context of realistic scenarios ?",
    "after all , congruence singularities are not real spacetime singularities where curvatures diverge . here , we are tempted to draw an analogy from null geodesic congruences , for which congruence singularities are nothing but the well - studied caustics where optical intensities get magnified immensely .",
    "similarly , in the case of timelike geodesics , we may end up with accretion  like effects resulting out of matter accumulation in the neighborhood of a point .",
    "for instance , our visualisation analyses do show how the square elements change shape , get rotated because of variations in the metric functions .",
    "we may contemplate such accretion effects for flows around brane ",
    "world black holes @xcite and in such situations , it will become necessary to pursue a line of thought very similar to what we have followed in this article .",
