    "identifying links between progenitor and descendant galaxy populations to empirically infer galaxy evolution tracks is notoriously difficult .",

    "* ) , constant mass , or by isolating specific galaxy populations such as brightest cluster galaxies  @xcite .",
    "simple linking methods such as these become inaccurate as the galaxy population evolves with time .",

    "a more physically motivated linking method is to forge progenitor / descendant links at a fixed comoving number density based on the cumulative stellar mass function  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to , e.g. , fixed mass linking , the underlying assumption is that the most massive galaxies at some redshift evolve into the most massive systems at some other redshift .",
    "forging progenitor / descendant links at a constant comoving number density can accommodate evolution in the mass of the galaxy population , and is easily performed for any dataset where a galaxy stellar mass function is available . comoving number density analysis can lead to predictions about the mass  @xcite , star formation rate  @xcite , size  @xcite , gas fraction  @xcite , or morphology evolution of a galaxy population which would would not have been possible under more simplistic linking assumptions .",
    "the key feature of comoving number density analysis is that galaxy mass rankings ( and hence @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or other parameters ) are less prone to changes than the galaxy properties itself .",
    "that is , galaxy masses or other properties of galaxies can evolve significantly , while assigned number density remains reasonably static among a galaxy population _ as long as the mass rank order among a galaxy population is preserved_. this makes constant comoving number density a better metric or linking progenitor / descendant galaxy populations together at different observational epochs compared to the underlying physical properties themselves .",
    "although comoving number density analysis provides a good first order approximation to forge progenitor / descendant links  @xcite , galaxies do not exactly move along constant comoving number density evolution tracks .",
    "the galaxy rank order assumption required for constant comoving number density linking to work is broken by : 1 ) galaxy mergers and 2 ) stochastic growth rates .",
    "galaxy mergers change the total number density of galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies of low mass naturally  move up \" in mass rank and change their assigned number density when higher mass galaxies coagulate during merger events .",
    "stochasticity in growth rates ( including star formation rates as well as ex - situ growth rates from mergers ) introduces an element of randomness which violates the assumption that galaxies maintain their relative mass rank order .",
    "stochastic growth rates can lead to a change in the median mass rank of a tracked galaxy population .",
    "both galaxy merger rates and stochastic growth rates are naturally handled in numerical cosmological simulations .",
    "galaxy comoving number density analysis has been analyzed using semi - analytic models  @xcite , abundance matching  @xcite , and hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "these studies have compared the mass and velocity dispersion evolution of galaxy populations using the explicitly tracked simulated galaxy merger trees to compare against the inferred evolution from an assumed constant comoving number density .",
    "these studies agree that constant comoving number density analysis recovers the median stellar mass evolution of a galaxy population within a factor of a few ( comoving number density recovers median masses a factor of @xmath62 - 3 higher than explicitly tracked galaxies at redshift @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , two issues remain : 1 ) the factor of @xmath62 - 3 error in the median mass evolution of galaxy populations is driven by a net evolution in the median number density of evolving galaxy populations , and 2 ) the significant scatter in the number density evolution tracks that initially similar galaxy populations follow .",
    "both of these issues can be partially addressed using cosmological simulations  @xcite . in  @xcite we provided fits to the median mass and number density evolution of tracked galaxy populations .",
    "we showed that by substituting prescribed galaxy evolution tracks of non - constant comoving number density in place of constant comoving number density the correct median evolution can be obtained .",
    "non - constant comoving number density progenitor / descendant links have now been applied to observational datasets  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the non - constant comoving number density evolution tracks do not describe the scatter in number density evolution for tracked galaxy populations , and ( relatedly ) require separate fits to define the forward and backward median number density evolution .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis presented by in  @xcite by quantifying the scatter in the number density evolution of tracked galaxy populations and show how this scatter links the forward and backward galaxy number density evolution tracks .",
    "the primary goals of this paper are : 1 ) to explore the relationship that exists between forward and backward number density evolution rates via their intrinsic scatter 2 ) to provide tabulated rates for the number density evolution and scatter that can be applied to observational galaxy selection and analysis , and 3 ) to consider the relative importance of galaxy coagulation and scattered / stochastic growth rates in driving number density evolution we provide general fits to the dispersion of a galaxy population in number density space as a function of time from its initial selection .",
    "we also present an analytic framework that relates the forward and backward evolution of galaxies in number density space based on their scatter rates .",
    "we show that using this simple framework the asymmetry in the forward and backward number density evolution rates can be broadly captured .",
    "fitting functions are provided that can be applied to observational data sets to track galaxy populations , including both the median number density evolution and scatter .",
    "we also address the relative importance of scattered growth rates and galaxy mergers in driving galaxy number density evolution .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : aa ] we outline a basic formalism for tracking galaxy populations in number density space .",
    "this includes a simple relation between the distribution of galaxies in number density space when tracked forward and backward in time . in section",
    "[ sec : physicalprocesses ] we break down the total / net number density evolution rate in terms of the two underlying processes : galaxy coagulation and scattered growth rates .",
    "we quantify the relative impact of coagulation and scatter and explore the galaxy masses and redshift ranges where each effect dominates . in section",

    "we conclude and summarize in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "within a comoving volume , @xmath8 , we rank the galaxies in the order of decreasing stellar mass and assign each galaxy a rank @xmath9 where @xmath10 etc .",
    "a galaxy with mass @xmath11  and associated rank @xmath9  will have a cumulative number density @xmath12 .",
    "mass , rank , and cumulative in this paper . ] number density are therefore exactly interchangeable . however , we present our analysis in terms of number density arguments because number density is less prone to changes compared to galaxy mass .",
    "rank and number density can also be assigned via dark matter halo mass , velocity dispersion , or other appropriate property .",
    "however , we have found in previous work @xcite that using stellar velocity dispersion or dark matter halo mass to assign rank produces similar number density evolution as stellar mass .",
    "we therefore assign rank and number density according to stellar mass throughout this paper .",
    "we consider how a galaxy population selected within a narrow range in number density would evolve with time .",
    "since each of the selected galaxies from the population follows its own distinct evolution in mass ordered rank , the number density of the descendant galaxy population is best described with a distribution function .",
    "the probability of a galaxy with initial number density @xmath13 at redshift @xmath14 evolving to have a number density @xmath15 after time @xmath16 can be described as @xmath17 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to @xmath18 as the descendant distribution function ( ddf ) which describes the distribution of number densities into which an initially homogeneous galaxy population evolves",
    ".    not every galaxy in the initial population will necessarily survive until @xmath19 ; some will be consumed in galaxy mergers .",
    "the integral of the ddf over all descendant masses therefore yields @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the galaxy survival fraction .",
    "the mean log number density of the descendant galaxy population is given by @xmath22 evaluating equation  [ eon : descendant_avg_rank ] requires specifying a form of the ddf which we provide in section  [ sec : ddf ] .",
    "the ddf can be determined empirically based on numerical simulations .",
    "we find functional forms and best fits to the ddf in this section using the illustris simulation  @xcite .",
    "the illustris simulation employs a model for galaxy formation  @xcite which is able to broadly reproduce the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift @xmath23",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : foward_num_dens_evo ] shows the evolution of the distribution of four galaxy populations as they are tracked in time from an initial selection redshift of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( left to right panels , respectively ) .",
    "the tracked galaxy populations are selected to have stellar masses of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath2 in bins of @xmath30 dex width at their initial selection redshift .",
    "the masses of all galaxies are tracked forward in time using the merger trees described in  @xcite .",
    "galaxies that are consumed in a merger event are included until they are consumed .",
    "masses are converted to number densities by inverting the tabulated fitting functions to the cumulative galaxy stellar mass function from  @xcite .",
    "the ddfs presented in figure  [ fig : foward_num_dens_evo ] are reasonably well described by a log normal distribution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean number density ( in log space ) of the descendant population , and @xmath33 is the standard deviation .",
    "the survival fraction , @xmath34 , mean number density @xmath32 , and spread , @xmath33 , are functions of the initial number density , initial selection redshift , and elapsed time .",
    "we construct fits to @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 which are presented in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : foward_num_dens_evo ] indicates the fits to the median number density evolution track ( dashed lines ) , the @xmath35 one - sigma fits ( dot - dashed lines ) , and the @xmath35 two - sigma fits ( dotted lines ) for the tracked galaxy populations .",
    "these fits accurately capture the median evolution and and broadly capture the scatter evolution found in the simulation .",
    "the median number density evolution follows non - constant number density evolution tracks with evolution .",
    "the magnitude of the change in number density varies based on initial selection redshift and initial selection mass , but ranges from roughly constant to changes of @xmath36 dex evolution out to redshift @xmath37 .",
    "the scatter grows at an approximate rate of @xmath38 , with more detailed fits given in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "the discussion to this point has been limited to the ddf .",
    "we can similarly consider the progenitor distribution function ( pdf ) , which can be examined using the same numerical simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] shows the pdf for four galaxy populations selected in thin mass ( number density ) bins at redshift @xmath39 .",
    "direct fits to the mean number density evolution and scatter evolution can be found in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "the direct fits are shown with black solid lines in figure  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] which track the simulation median number density evolution very well by construction .",
    "examination of figures  [ fig : foward_num_dens_evo ] and  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] shows that the median evolution of the pdf and ddf have different slopes .",
    "this is a real consequence of the median number density evolution rate being different for galaxy populations that are tracked forward and backward in time  ( see figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , the pdf and ddf can be related by considering the mean mass rank of the progenitor galaxies that will grow into galaxies with mass rank @xmath40 . to achieve this we need to consider the galaxies that will scatter / evolve into a particular descendant bin given the relative abundance of progenitors and the ddf .",
    "specifically , the mean log number density of the progenitor galaxy population that will evolve to have a number density @xmath40 after a time @xmath16 is @xmath41 where the integration is over all possible progenitor galaxies @xmath42 and @xmath43 is _ the same _ ddf described in the previous subsection .",
    "the factor of @xmath44 describes the relative abundance of the possible progenitor galaxies .",
    "specifically , in analogy to the galaxy stellar mass function  where the distribution of galaxies in stellar mass is described via @xmath45  the distribution of galaxies in number density space can be described as @xmath46 . however , unlike the stellar mass function , galaxies are trivially distributed in number density space such that @xmath47 .",
    "we can therefore express equation  [ eqn : prog_avg_rank1 ] as @xmath48 the integrands of equation  [ eqn : prog_avg_rank ] are performing a convolution of ( a ) the probability that a galaxy with initial number density @xmath49 evolves into a galaxy with number density @xmath40 with ( b ) the relative abundance of galaxies with initial number density @xmath49 .",
    "the relative abundance factor was not present in the descendant average mass rank calculation and is the cause of the offset between the forward and backward number density evolution tracking .",
    "the physical asymmetry is driven by the relative over - abundance of fast growth tracks owing to the higher abundance of low mass galaxies .",
    "the absolute contribution of a progenitor bin must take into account both the likelihood that a galaxy would scatter into the desired descendant bin , and the relative abundance of the progenitor galaxy population . using equations  [ eqn : ddf ] and  [ eqn : prog_avg_rank ] the average mass rank of the progenitor galaxy population can be inferred .",
    "the resulting inferred number density evolution trajectories are indicated with black dashed lines in figure  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] .",
    "the inferred number density evolution is within @xmath60.05 dex out to redshift z=2.5 .",
    "beyond redshift @xmath50 the fit becomes poor for the two low mass bins , owing to significant contributions to the progenitor galaxy population from outside of the fitting function validity region .",
    "the inferred number density for the two more massive bins ( red and brown ) remains in broad qualitative agreement with the simulation data out to @xmath50 .",
    "the errors in the inferred number density evolution are driven largely by deviations from the ddf from a strict log - normal distribution .",
    "although the log normal ddf assumption is in broad agreement with the empirically derived ddf from the simulations , there are asymmetric features of the ddf which become increasingly prominent as the galaxy population is tracked further in redshift .",
    "the offsets seen in figure  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] are small enough to give confidence that our method of linking progenitor distribution functions and descendant distribution functions is correct , but will always be less accurate than the direct fits provided in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "finally , we note that demonstrating the time - reversibility of descendant and progenitor tracking is made possible here by the definition of a single , continuous fitting function in @xmath51 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 for the median and scatter of the ddf .",
    "such continuous fits have not been previously provided .",
    "in this section we discuss the physical processes that drive the evolution in the number density tracks shown previously .",
    "specifically , we quantify the importance of galaxy coagulation and stochastic galaxy growth rates toward number density evolution and compare the relative importance of these two mechanisms .    the average ( median ) number density evolution discussed at length in the previous section",
    "can be described as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rate of change of the average number density in linear ( not log ) space . using this form , we consider the physical processes that drive the average number density evolution .",
    "populations of galaxies change their median mass rank either 1 ) because a galaxy moves up in mass rank ( in order of decreasing mass ) by one when two galaxies above its mass merge to form a single galaxy * or * 2 ) by rapid or slow mass growth , such that the galaxies change their mass rank relative to their peers .",
    "_ these two processes provide a complete basis that can capture all of the galaxy mass assigned rank order evolution .",
    "_ moreover , these two processes mirror the breakdown of the two fundamental assumptions of constant comoving number density analysis : that galaxy mergers do not significantly impact the total number density of galaxies , and that galaxies preserve their mass assigned rank order in time . in the previous section",
    "we showed how the average number density evolves for tracked galaxy populations in time . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the relative importance that galaxy coagulation and scattered growth rates have on comoving number density evolution .",
    "the median number density rate of change for a galaxy population can be expressed with explicit dependence on the two number density evolution channels @xmath54 where @xmath55 gives the rate of change of cumulative number density owing to changes in the total galaxy number density via mergers above the mass scale of interest ( hereafter : the  galaxy coagulation \" rate ) and @xmath56 gives number density rate of change from scattered growth .",
    "equation  [ eqn : dn_dz ] provides a rigorous and clear breakdown of the total number density evolution rate that facilitates the analysis in the subsequent subsections .",
    "however , it does not constitute a unique breakdown of the total number density evolution rate .",
    "for example , while galaxy coagulation is driven by galaxy mergers above a given mass scale ( as described in detail below ) the galaxy scatter rate also contains a contribution from ex - situ mass growth driven by galaxy mergers .",
    "we therefore emphasize that our primary motivation for adopting the breakdown in equation  [ eqn : dn_dz ] is that the two term mirror the two fundamental assumptions of constant comoving number density analysis .",
    "galaxy coagulation drives intuitive net changes in the number density of a galaxy population by making total galaxy number density a non - conserved quantity .",
    "it is also fairly intuitive that an individual galaxy can undergo a change in its mass ordered _ rank _ ( and therefore can adjust its assigned number density ) by growing much faster or slower than its peers .",
    "it is somewhat less intuitive to predict the impact that relative galaxy growth rates have on the mass rank order evolution when averaged over a galaxy population .",
    "however , as shown below , the contribution of scatter to the median mass rank of a galaxy population is significant when compared to the coagulation rate for a range of galaxy masses and redshifts .",
    "a galaxy of mass @xmath57 will necessarily change mass rank if two galaxies both with masses @xmath58 merge together .",
    "when this happens , the number of galaxies with mass @xmath59 will decrease by exactly one , forcing all lower mass galaxies to move up in mass rank .",
    "we therefore define the galaxy coagulation rate as the rate at which galaxies with mass rank higher than @xmath60 are being swallowed by mergers ( i.e. undergoing mergers with larger systems ) .",
    "we calculate the galaxy coagulation rate in the simulation by identifying all galaxies with initial mass @xmath59 which are not the main progenitor of a halo in a subsequent snapshot  indicating that the galaxy has been consumed by a larger system in a merger event .",
    "this number is converted to the coagulation rate using a first - order finite difference scheme with a target redshift step size of @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting coagulation rate is shown in figure  [ fig : destructive_merger_rate ] .",
    "the coagulation rate is lower for high mass systems compared to their low mass counterparts owing simply to the lower abundance of high mass systems ; the effect of galaxy coagulation rate on number density is cumulative .",
    "the coagulation rate @xmath62 is equal to the galaxy - galaxy merger rate integrated over appropriate parameters .",
    "traditionally the galaxy - galaxy merger rate is tabulated as the number of mergers per unit redshift per unit mass ratio per halo , @xmath63  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxy coagulation rate can be obtained via the galaxy - galaxy merger rate by integrating over the appropriate limits @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the primary galaxy mass , @xmath66 is the mass ratio of the secondary to the primary , and @xmath67 is the merger descendant mass .",
    "the additional mass function dependence in the integrand is used to convert the  per halo \" into a  per volume \" . adopting the tabulated and parameterized merger rates of  @xcite , the best - fit galaxy stellar mass functions from the appendix of  @xcite , and integrating equation  [ eqn : red_merg_rate ] yields an agreeable result to the direct measurement presented in figure  [ fig : destructive_merger_rate ] .",
    "equation  [ eqn : red_merg_rate ] reduces the three - parameter dependence of the total merger rate expression ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) to a two - parameter dependence on mass @xmath57 and redshift @xmath69 .",
    "this parameter reduction is associated with the limitations in the mass ratio that restrict mergers to only include systems which are both more massive than @xmath57 .",
    "variable / stochastic growth rates of galaxies can drive mass rank order changes among a galaxy population . in the ideal picture of constant comoving number density evolution all galaxies grow in mass with time at a rate that maintains mass rank ordering ( i.e. no galaxies are allowed to  pass \" similar - mass systems in their mass rank order ) .",
    "this assumption breaks down for real galaxy populations which experience stochastically varying growth rates owing to , e.g. , the spread in the star formation main sequence and/or stellar mass growth via galaxy mergers .",
    "real galaxy populations will change mass rank when growth rates of similar mass galaxies are not homogeneous  driven by either scatter in the star formation main sequence or ex - situ growth via stochastic galaxy mergers .",
    "unlike galaxy coagulation , the sense of mass rank order change owing to scattered growth rates can be either positive or negative .",
    "if a tracked galaxy population passes a large number of galaxies in mass rank order , fewer systems will remain with higher masses which results in a number density evolution rate of the same sign as galaxy mergers ( positive expresses the number density evolution rate with redshift . ] , according to equation  [ eqn : dn_dz ] ) .",
    "conversely , if a tracked galaxy population is passed by more systems , the number of systems with larger masses will grow with time leading to a number density evolution rate of the opposite sign as galaxy mergers .    to handle these two cases ,",
    "we identify the median mass of a tracked galaxy population as being @xmath70 at time @xmath71 and @xmath72 at some later time @xmath73",
    ". we can then define    * * galaxy mass rank demotion * : the number of galaxies with mass @xmath74 at time @xmath71 that have mass @xmath75 at @xmath73 . * * galaxy mass rank promotion * : the number of galaxies with mass @xmath76 at time @xmath71 that have mass @xmath77 at @xmath73 .",
    "we adopt the terms  galaxy demotion \" and  galaxy promotion \" since the tracked galaxy population is being demoted or promoted in mass rank ordering relative to the rest of the galaxy population .",
    "we tabulate the galaxy promotion / demotion rates in the simulation using finite differencing with spacing of @xmath61 . in practice",
    ", we find all galaxies with @xmath78 at redshift @xmath69 and use the merger tree to identify all descendants at redshift @xmath79 .",
    "the galaxy promotion rate has the same sign as the galaxy merger rate ( positive ) , while the galaxy demotion rate has the opposite .",
    "note that both in situ mass growth as well as growth via mergers are important to the scatter rate .",
    "however , galaxies that are not the main progenitor at time @xmath71 of their descendent at time @xmath73 are considered to have been  consumed \" , and therefore do not contribute to the scatter rate .",
    "the forward promotion and demotion mass rank scatter rates are shown in the left and right panels of figure  [ fig : foward_scatter_rate ] as solid lines for several mass bins .",
    "the relative values of the galaxy promotion and demotion rates are set by the average mass growth rates of the tracked galaxy populations , the average mass growth rates of galaxies of neighboring mass ( number density ) bins , as well as the relative abundance of galaxies in the tracked and neighboring mass growth bins . at redshift @xmath39 ,",
    "the galaxy promotion rate is larger than the galaxy demotion rate by a factor of @xmath80 for @xmath81 systems but smaller by factor of @xmath82 for @xmath83 systems .",
    "the point of equality ( i.e. no net change from scatter in the median number density of the tracked galaxy population ) between the promotion and demotion rates is around @xmath84 .",
    "we explore the relative importance of the galaxy promotion , demotion , and coagulation rates in more depth in the following subsection .      to compare the relative importance of the galaxy coagulation and scattered growth rates , we adopt simple polynomial fits that are shown as dashed lines in figures  [ fig : destructive_merger_rate ] and  [ fig : foward_scatter_rate ] .",
    "the form of the fits take the same fitting formula as the scatter and survival fraction fits discussed in appendix  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : compare_relative_importance ] shows the net number density rate of change for galaxies for four mass bins ( as indicated in the legend ) .",
    "most galaxies experience positive number density evolution rates which is driven by the combined dominance of mergers and mass rank promotion  both of which drive galaxies to lower number densities as they move to lower redshift . however , there are periods at early times where mass rank demotion dominates for massive galaxies ( i.e. lower mass galaxies are passing this bin ) leading to a galaxy population moving to lower mass rank ( higher number density ) with time .",
    "these periods of time are indicated with dashed lines in figure  [ fig : compare_relative_importance ] .",
    "the net number density evolution rate can drop to zero and/or change signs depending on the relative importance of the galaxy coagulation , promotion , and demotion rates .",
    "we therefore address the relative contribution of mergers and scatter by considering the magnitude of the promotion and demotion rates ( each shown individually ) normalized by the galaxy coagulation rate as shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : compare_relative_importance ] . with the exception of the demotion rates of the two lowest mass bins",
    "we find that the promotion- and demotion - scatter rates tend to be larger than the galaxy coagulation rate .",
    "the galaxy scatter rates are an order of magnitude larger than the coagulation rates for high mass galaxies at high redshift . however , since the promotion and demotion rates partially cancel it is possible for the coagulation rates to still dominate the net median mass rank order evolution .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : compare_relative_importance ] shows the fractional contribution of mergers to the total number density evolution rate . here",
    ", we have specifically defined the merger contribution to the total number density evolution rate as @xmath85 galaxy coagulation is the dominant contributor to the net number density evolution rate for galaxies with stellar masses @xmath86 out to redshift @xmath37 . for galaxies that are more massive than @xmath87",
    ", the galaxy coagulation will be subdominant to scatter at early times , but eventually comes to dominate .",
    "however , for the most massive systems , scatter naturally dominates the mass rank order evolution budget owing to ( i ) the paucity of more massive systems that are able to drive large galaxy coagulation rates and ( ii ) the dominance of ex - situ stellar mass growth driven by stochastic merger events with lower mass galaxies for massive , quenched systems .",
    "massive galaxies in the illustris simulation grow predominantly through galaxy mergers  @xcite . yet",
    ", scatter in their rank order dominates over galaxy coagulation when considering their mass rank order evolution budget .",
    "these two claims are consistent because the ex - situ growth of massive galaxies is driven by mergers with less massive systems .",
    "mergers with less massive systems  even if they are abundant and significantly impact the galaxy s mass evolution  do not influence the galaxy coagulation rate .",
    "instead , the stochastic growth histories of massive galaxies associated with galaxy mergers only acts to increase the influence of mass rank order scatter on the total mass rank order evolution budget .",
    "a converse argument is true for low mass galaxies which build up the majority of their mass through in - situ star formation while their total mass rank order evolution budget is dominated by galaxy coagulation .",
    "specifically , the galaxy mergers that lead to the large galaxy coagulation rate for low mass galaxies do not involve the low mass galaxies themselves . instead",
    ", the galaxy coagulation rate is set by the merger rate between two larger galaxies and the galaxy scatter rate is set by the scatter in the in - situ mass growth rates .",
    "forging progenitor / descendant links between observed galaxy populations at different redshifts using a constant cumulative number density is widely used and reasonably physically justified .",
    "it has been shown using abundance matching models , semi - analytic models , and hydrodynamical simulations that one can recover , e.g. , the mass evolution of milky way progenitors while only introducing errors of order @xmath88 dex .",
    "however , the sense of this error is systematic and partially correctable . in  @xcite and this paper ,",
    "we have argued for a modified method of forging progenitor / descendant links using relaxed assumptions about the evolution of galaxies in comoving number density space based on the results of numerical simulations .",
    "we have advocated that progenitor / descendant galaxy populations can be statistically linked based on their comoving number density .",
    "however , we also argue that this link must include both the median evolution of the galaxy population in comoving number density space  @xcite and the significant intrinsic scatter ( this paper ) .    in this paper we analyzed galaxy evolution in number density space using basic analytic arguments and empirical fits derived from the illustris simulation .",
    "the empirical fits include a direct measure of the intrinsic scatter that makes identifying _ direct _ progenitor / descendant links impossible .",
    "accounting for the intrinsic scatter makes it possible to draw conclusions about the statistical distribution of possible progenitor / descendant properties that would not be captured using a single comoving number density track .",
    "this is critical for describing the full range of formation histories that galaxies may evolve through . recognizing the significant impact of scattered growth rates on the formation of galaxy populations is important for avoiding a secondary form of progenitor bias : considering only the median growth track to the exclusion of all others .",
    "we have made an attempt in this paper to reconcile the asymmetry that is encountered when tracking galaxy populations forward and backward in time .",
    "it is well - established that tracking galaxies forward and backward in time yields median number density evolution tracks that are not symmetric .",
    "we have shown that using the single ddf prescribed in section  [ sec : ddf ] , one can broadly recover forward evolution of galaxies in number density space , and approximately recover the backward / progenitor distribution function .",
    "this is important because it allows us to view the number density evolution of galaxies as a single coherent process , regardless of whether one is tracking galaxies forward or backward in time .",
    "the fits presented in figure  [ fig : foward_num_dens_evo ] are very similar to those obtained by  @xcite which were obtained using abundance matching on a dark matter only simulation  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that our fits are primarily driven by the stochastic assembly of dark matter underlying dark matter haloes , rather than the specific physics implementation included in the illustris simulations .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the similar growth tracks that have been reported in semi - analytic models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other hydro simulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there is value in confirming and updating the specific fits presented in this paper using other simulation methods involving different assumptions about the baryonic physics and within other ( particularly , larger ) simulation volumes .",
    "the evolution tracks prescribed in this paper can be used to link selected galaxy populations to progenitor or descendant galaxy _",
    "populations_. in contrast to linking at a constant comoving number density , or at a non - constant comoving number density  @xcite , the pdfs and ddfs will identify a wider range of possible galaxy progenitors / descendants .",
    "the spread in the progenitor / descendant population properties can be set based on results of numerical simulations .",
    "a detailed exploration of how our prescriptions can be applied to observational data is left to a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "there , we describe in detail and validate a straightforward method to translate the ddfs tabulated in this paper into mass , size , and star formation rate evolution tracks based directly on observational data .",
    "in this paper we have critically examined the nature of galaxy evolution in comoving number density space .",
    "we have provided a detailed description of how the median number density and standard deviation for a tracked galaxy population evolves with time .",
    "the primary conclusions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "we defined the descendant distribution function ( ddf ) and progenitor distribution function ( pdf ) to capture the median number density evolution , the spread among the tracked galaxy population , and the survival fraction of tracked galaxies .",
    "practical fits to the ddf and pdf were provided which can be applied to observational data .",
    "publicly available python scripts to evaluate the fitting functions have been provided .",
    "2 .   the median number density evolution described in the ddf and pdf are not symmetric .",
    "this asymmetry is driven by the convolution of the ddf with the relative abundance of progenitor galaxies that is required to recover the pdf .",
    "a quantitative description of this is given in equation  [ eqn : prog_avg_rank ] which is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : backward_num_dens_evo ] .",
    "3 .   the total ddf evolution rate can be broken down into a contribution from galaxy coagulation and galaxy scattered growth rates .",
    "we quantified the relative contribution of mergers and scatter , and found that galaxy coagulation is the dominant driver of the number density evolution rate for a range of mass bins and redshift ranges ( described in section  [ sec : relativeroles ] and figure  [ fig : compare_relative_importance ] ) .",
    "the evolution tracks for galaxy populations in number density space defined in this paper for redshift @xmath89 in the mass ranges @xmath90 can be used to analyze observational data sets .",
    "a forthcoming paper  @xcite will practically demonstrate how the diversity of evolution tracks in number density space impact conclusions about the mass , star formation rate , and velocity dispersion evolution of galaxy populations .",
