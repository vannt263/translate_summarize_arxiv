    "the first accretion - powered millisecond pulsar , sax j1808.4 - 3658 , was discovered a decade ago @xcite . since then",
    "several other millisecond x - ray pulsars with spin periods between 1.7 and 5.4ms have been discovered ( e.g. xte j0929 - 314 , xte j1751 - 305 , xte 1807 - 294 and xte j1814 - 338 ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these neutron stars have considerably weaker magnetic dipole moments , @xmath0tm@xmath1 , than the conventional x - ray pulsars .",
    "the accretion disc then extends much closer to the neutron star , where it reaches such a high temperature that the opacity is dominated by electron scattering and radiation pressure can grow stronger than the gas pressure . on the other hand",
    "the accretion rates in these systems can be so low that the alfvn radius might be located outside of the co - rotation radius of the neutron star .",
    "conventionally it has been thought that such systems will eject the mass that is transferred from the companion star through the propeller mechanism @xcite , though it has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that the velocity excess right outside the co - rotation radius is insufficient to eject all the matter .",
    "@xcite found that when the alfvn radius is only slightly larger than the co - rotation radius then the disc will cycle between one state in which the matter is accumulated outside the co - rotation radius and another state in which it is accreted onto the star .",
    "later @xcite constructed a steady accretion disc model , in which the entire disc is located outside of the co - rotation radius .",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star is penetrating this disc and is mediating an exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disc and the neutron star as in the model by @xcite . since the entire accretion disc is rotating more slowly than the neutron star in this case , the disc brakes the rotation of the neutron star .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite have ignored the possibility of an internal dynamo in the accretion disc , and have considered only the magnetic field that is generated in the disc by the mismatch in the rotation of the neutron star and the disc .",
    "however the magnetic field due to a dynamo can strengthen the coupling between the accretion disc and the neutron star , and we @xcite have shown that the angular momentum exchange between the accretion disc and the neutron star can increase by more than an order of magnitude compared to the standard model by @xcite . furthermore the dynamo is insensitive to the rotation of the neutron star , and can therefore in principle provide a spin - up torque even at a low accretion rate .    a complementary approach to study the magnetic interaction between an accretion disc and a star is represented by the numerical simulations by @xcite . in these simulations it is possible to study more complicated magnetic field geometries than are accessible to semi - analytic studies",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , but the resolution is so low that it is not possible to study the appearance of small - scale turbulence and the resulting turbulent transport and dynamo action in the simulation .",
    "thus these simulations do not really address the viability of a dynamo in the disc .",
    "however there are other things one can learn from these simulations .",
    "they show how the matter is streaming via funnel flows from the accretion disc onto the magnetic poles of the neutron star .",
    "furthermore they show that angular momentum is also lost from the accretion disc through the jets that are accelerated away from the disc .",
    "@xcite make a distinction between a conical jet that transport most of the mass , and a less dense axial jet inside the conical jet .",
    "the latter component can dominate the energetics if the star is in the propeller regime .",
    "it is also noteworthy that these simulations confirm that some matter might still be accreted when the star is in the propeller regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend our previous study ( paper i ) of an accretion disc with an internal dynamo around a magnetised star to the discs around millisecond pulsars .",
    "the difference is that due to the weak magnetic field the disc extends to much smaller radii , at which it becomes so hot that a significant part of the opacity is due to electron scattering , and radiation pressure might dominate over the gas pressure . therefore in the spirit of @xcite",
    "we divide the disc into an outer region with gas pressure and free - free opacity , a middle region with gas pressure and electron scattering opacity , and an inner region with radiation pressure and electron scattering . in sect .",
    "2 we derive a single ordinary differential equation , which is generally applicable for the radial structure of the accretion disc independently of the equation of state and the form of the opacity .",
    "we then introduce the equations of state and the opacity prescriptions for the different regions of the disc in sect . 3 and present the numerical solutions in sect .",
    "the properties of these solutions and their application to the millisecond x - ray pulsars are discussed in sect . 5 , and we finally summarise our results in sect .",
    "our approach is an extension of the standard model for a thin accretion disc ( @xcite ) , and it follows closely the method that we introduced in paper i , though we will now consider a general opacity law and equation of state .",
    "for this reason we only summarise the steps leading up to eq .",
    "( 21 ) of paper i , after which we deviate from the treatment in paper i.    the surface density of the accretion disc is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density , and @xmath5 the half thickness of the disc .",
    "we can then write the accretion rate as @xmath6 which is independent of the radial coordinate @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 is the radial velocity .",
    "a thin accretion disc is supported by the centrifugal force in the radial direction , so we get that @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the azimuthal velocity , @xmath11 the gravitational constant and @xmath12 is the mass of the accretor .",
    "this shows that the disc rotates in a keplerian fashion .",
    "the disc is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , which gives us that the pressure at the midplane of the disc is @xmath13 but the hydrostatic equilibrium can also be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "this shows that the keplerian velocity is highly supersonic in a thin accretion disc .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum leads to the following height - integrated equation ( paper i ) @xmath16_{-h}^{h}r   + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\mbox{d}}{\\mbox{d } r}\\left[r^{3}\\nu\\sigma \\frac{\\mbox{d}}{\\mbox{d } r }      \\left(\\frac{l}{r^{2}}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where the specific angular momentum @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the viscosity .",
    "the magnetic term describes the exchange of angular momentum between the disc and the star via the magnetosphere .",
    "we assume that the vertical magnetic field is due to the dipolar field of the neutron star , so that its value in the equatorial plane is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic dipole moment of the star .",
    "there are two sources for @xmath21 .",
    "the shear between the keplerian disc and the magnetosphere produces a field whose value in the upper half of the disc is @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 is the angular velocity of the star , and @xmath25 is a dimensionless parameter of the order of a few @xcite .    the magnetohydrodynamical turbulence in the accretion disc is also generating a magnetic field , @xmath26 , through a dynamo action ( see for instance @xcite ) . in order to estimate the strength of this magnetic field we start by making the assumptions that the turbulence is not affected by @xmath27 , which is justified because in general @xmath28-component of the turbulent maxwell stress tensor , @xmath29 , that transports the angular momentum , and we couple this to the pressure in the disc through the @xcite @xmath30-prescription @xmath31 note that a negative maxwell stress means that the angular momentum is transported outwards and that numerical simulations suggest that @xmath32 @xcite .",

    "neither one of these behaviours is entirely physical and one must keep in mind that we have ignored the importance of the radial pressure gradient and the inertial term in eq . ( [ 3 ] ) ( see for instance @xcite ) , and we have not attempted to model how the plasma is entering the stellar magnetic field lines to form a funnel flow onto the magnetic poles of the neutron star .",
    "one further problem with the inner region of the disc solution is that it is known to be viscously and thermally unstable @xcite .",
    "this instability persists if the accretion disc is threaded by a stellar magnetic field @xcite , but so far it has not been investigated what happens if the accretion disc is sustaining its own magnetic field through a dynamo .      to understand the nature of the exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disc and the neutron star we multiply eq .",

    "the viscous stress at the outer edge of the disc is responsible for removing the angular momentum that is transported outwards through the accretion disc , and does not affect the angular momentum evolution of the neutron star .",
    "the viscous stress at the inner edge of the disc on the other hand can result in a torque that transports angular momentum away from the neutron star @xmath189 this term is usually neglected in accretion disc theory since the standard accretion disc solution has a case d inner boundary .",
    "but it can transport angular momentum from the neutron star to the disc when we have a case v inner boundary .",
    "we report on all the components and the total sum of the torques on our fiducial neutron star in tab.[table1 ] .",
    "the main factor determining the total torque is the accretion rate . in paper",

    "@xcite reported @xmath196s between @xmath197 and @xmath198hzs@xmath145 for sax j1808.4 - 3658 , but @xcite noted that the measurements of this source are plagued by large variations in the pulse shape , and put an upper limit of @xmath199hzs@xmath145 on the spin variations at any instant . some of the timing noise in the millisecond x - ray pulsars can be explained by the motion of the hot spot on the neutron star @xcite , and may thus not correspond to real changes in the spin period of the neutron star .",
    "the spin variation corresponds to a torque @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star measured in @xmath202kgm@xmath203 , and @xmath204 is the spin derivative in units of @xmath205hzs@xmath145 . in the @xcite model , the spin variation of igr j00291 + 5934",
    "would imply then an accretion rate of at least @xmath206kgs@xmath145 , which is uncomfortably large , but our tab .",
    "[ table1 ] shows that it is possible to enhance the torque severalfold by coupling the stellar magnetic field to the magnetic field generated by an internal dynamo in the disc , and through the fact that the inner edge of the accretion disc is then located outside the alfvn radius , which increases the amount of angular momentum that is advected onto the neutron star .",
    "thus it is possible that a lower accretion rate can produce the necessary torque , though we have not attempted to fit our model to this system .      a significant part of the luminosity is not generated in the accretion disc outside of @xmath173 , but rather it is released as the accreting matter falls onto the neutron star .",
    "we estimate that this luminosity is @xmath207 where we have assumed that both the potential energy difference between the inner edge of the accretion disc and the surface of the neutron star as well as the kinetic energy associated with the keplerian motion at the inner edge of the accretion disc is released at the surface of the neutron star .",
    "consequently @xmath208 .",
    "the neutron star can then contribute to the local heating in the accretion disc through its irradiation of the disc .",
    "assuming that the neutron star is a point source and the accretion disc is flaring , i.e. @xmath209 , the irradiation flux on the accretion disc is at most @xcite @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the disc albedo ( for a more complete treatment taking into account shadowing by the disc see @xcite ) .",
    "the local flux generated by the viscous heating in the accretion disc is on the other hand @xmath212 we thus find that @xmath213 and since @xmath214 we find that irradiation dominates for @xmath215 if @xmath216 .",
    "consequently irradiation dominates over viscous heating for @xmath217 km .",
    "thus the outer part of the accretion disc is hotter than is predicted by our model , which can be observed as an increased uv flux @xcite .",
    "thus we have underestimated the pressure in the outer disc , and since we have used the @xcite prescription @xmath218 to estimate @xmath26 , we have also underestimated @xmath26 and the torque from the outer disc on the neutron star . however , this torque is small in comparison to the total torque on the neutron star since @xmath219 is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath7 , and thus the effect of the irradiation of the outer disc does not significantly change our results .",
    "irradiation is unlikely to significantly affect the inner disc , but , as pointed out above , other effects , such as radial advection and the transition from a disc flow to a funnel flow , that are not considered in this paper become important in the inner disc .",
    "we will investigate these effects in the future .",
    "the accretion rates that have been observed in millisecond x - ray pulsars cover several orders of magnitude , and the highest accretion rates are sufficient that the innermost part of the accretion disc is dominated by radiation pressure and electron scattering . for these reasons",
    "we have followed the approach by @xcite and divided our disc model in three regions , an outer region dominated by gas pressures and kramer s opacity , a middle region dominated by gas pressure and electron scattering , and an inner region dominated by radiation pressure and electron scattering .",
    "the large spin changes that have been observed in some of the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars are difficult to explain in the model by @xcite , but the inclusion of a disc dynamo produces a significant enhancement of the torque between the accretion disc and the neutron star .",
    "this increase is not only due to the coupling between the magnetic fields of the neutron star and the accretion disc as such , but also to the fact that the accretion disc is truncated at a larger radius thus increasing the lever arm between the edge of the disc and the neutron star .",
