    "ooperative communication is one of the key parts of the future communication protocols , as the deployment of relays can improve link equality , extend coverage range and mitigate inference . in general , there are various relay strategies which are casted into three main categories , i.e. , amplify - and - forward ( af ) , decode - and - forward ( df ) and compressed - and - forward ( cf ) . among these relaying strategies , af strategy which has",

    "most of previous works , channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be perfectly known .",
    "however , this assumption can not be met in practice .",
    "channel estimation errors are always inevitable and drastically degrades system performance .",
    "it is well known that robust designs can reduce or mitigate the negative effects introduced by imperfect csi .",
    "this is also the motivation of our work . in this paper",
    ", we jointly optimize source precoder matrix and relay forwarding matrix for mutual information maximization under channel estimation errors .",
    "based on the properties of matrix - monotone functions , the optimal structure of robust transceivers is derived .",
    "then , an iterative water - filling solution is proposed .",
