    "the sky - average , or global , component of the redshifted @xmath0-cm signal represents a direct tracer of the bulk characteristics of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) during cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at redshidfts @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the observable quantity corresponds to a differential brightness temperature that depends on the fraction of neutral hydrogen and the spin temperature of the gas .",
    "this temperature encodes the effects on the igm of uv and x - ray radiation from the first generations of stars and stellar remnants @xcite . for @xmath7 , the large - scale evolution of the igm",
    "is captured as wideband features in the frequency spectrum of the brightness temperature below @xmath8 mhz , with expected absolute amplitudes lower than @xmath8 mk @xcite .",
    "the most direct instrumental approach to attempt the global measurement is the single - antenna , wideband - spectrometer design implemented by edges @xcite , bighorns @xcite , saras @xcite , and sci - hi @xcite .",
    "these ground - based experiments cover differing portions of the redshift domain , targeting specific features of the global @xmath0-cm signal . using a similar approach",
    ", the dare experiment aims to conduct this measurement from the far side of the moon to mitigate the impact of radio - frequency interference and the earth s ionosphere @xcite .",
    "the leda experiment also pursues the global signal through single - antenna total - power measurements , with the addition of interferometric measurements to help estimate instrumental and foreground parameters @xcite .    edges has conducted sky measurements from western australia since 2006 . until 2012",
    "the experiment relied on relative calibration provided by three - position switching at the input of the receiver .",
    "this approach did not fully account for the impedance mismatch between the antenna and the receiver , since reflections from the receiver input were assumed to be zero , and the system gain and antenna reflections were not referenced to the same calibration plane . in addition , the calibration did not consider a correction for beam chromaticity . despite this simplified approach , edges was able to place initial constraints on the duration of the eor and obtain a first - order estimate for the spectral index of diffuse emission in low - foreground regions @xcite .    in 2013 , edges deployed the first instrument that implemented the current end - to - end absolute calibration .",
    "this approach consists of 1 ) converting the noise power measured by the antenna at the receiver input to an absolute antenna temperature scale , properly accounting for impedance mismatches between the receiver and the antenna , 2 ) removing the effect of antenna losses , and 3 ) compensating for the effect of beam chromaticity .",
    "although in its first iteration it did not achieve the sensitivity for a cosmological detection , its high performance enabled quantification of perturbations in the ionosphere @xcite .    starting in 2015 , edges has operated a low - band ( @xmath9 mhz ) and a high - band ( @xmath2 mhz ) instrument .",
    "both share the same design and absolute calibration approach , and target redshifts that nominally correspond to the cosmic dawn ( @xmath10 ) and eor ( @xmath1 ) periods , respectively .",
    "they represent a significant upgrade with respect to previous iterations , with the objective of reducing systematic effects below the cosmological signal . in this revision",
    ", the fourpoint antenna @xcite was replaced with a blade model due to its lower beam chromaticity @xcite .",
    "the antenna reflection is periodically measured in situ to high accuracy .",
    "the receiver is calibrated in the laboratory to higher precision and accuracy than in 2013 , and in the field it operates underground with active temperature control .",

    "figure  ( [ figure_models_eor ] ) shows three phenomenological models for this signal , parameterized in terms of the redshift ( @xmath13 ) and duration ( @xmath12 ) of reionization @xcite .",
    "our receiver calibration follows the method introduced in @xcite , which involves measuring the spectra , reflection coefficients , and physical temperatures of four absolute calibrators connected externally to the receiver input , in place of the antenna .",
    "these calibration measurements are used to determine the function that converts the noise power measured by the instrument to antenna temperature referenced to the receiver input .",
    "we use this function to calibrate the sky measurements obtained in the field with the receiver operating at the same temperature as in the lab .    as part of the description of our calibration ,",
    "we expand on the methodology presented in @xcite by providing a model for the ambient and hot calibrator used as the absolute temperature reference .",
    "we also introduce two new frequency - dependent parameters  a scale and an offset  that relate the relative calibration obtained through the internal switching to the absolute calibration at the receiver input .",
    "after determining the fiducial receiver calibration , we model the uncertainties encountered in the laboratory measurements and propagate them to the calibrated antenna temperature using a monte carlo approach .",
    "we use simulated sky measurements as inputs in this process , and quantify the impact of potential calibration errors via the number of polynomial terms required to fit the corrupted spectrum and reduce the residuals below a nominal threshold of @xmath4 mk .",
    "robust estimates are obtained for the impact of each source of uncertainty , as well as for their combined effect . in order to focus on receiver uncertainties ,",
    "these simulations assume perfect removal of antenna losses and beam chromaticity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ section_edges ] describes the edges instrument and summarizes the receiver calibration strategy and nomenclature , section  [ section_calibration_measurements ] describes the calibration measurements and results , section  [ section_uncertainty_propagation ] describes the propagation of receiver uncertainty to the antenna temperature using monte carlo simulations , section  [ section_results ] presents the results of the uncertainty propagation , section  [ section_discussion ] discusses the limiting factors in the calibration performance and some alternatives for improvement , and section  [ section_conclusion ] summarizes the findings of this work .",
    "figure  [ figure_block_diagram ] presents a conceptual block diagram of the edges instrument .",
    "the receiver that operates in the field corresponds to the actual unit calibrated in the lab and it is part of an identical setup , except for the antenna and ground plane which only exist in the field .        physically , the receiver consists of a metal enclosure that houses the first - stage low - noise amplifier ( lna ) , noise references for relative calibration , additional stages of amplification , filtering , and conditioning , and electronics for remote measurement of the antenna reflection coefficient .",
    "the receiver operates at @xmath14c at all times in order to keep the noise and reflection characteristics of the lna stable during calibration and sky observations",
    ". temperature stability to better than @xmath15c is achieved using a thermal controller that reads out a thermistor mounted inside the receiver .",
    "based on the reading , the controller acts on a hot / cold plate attached to the bottom of the receiver to compensate for temperature drifts .    from the output of the receiver",
    "the rf signal is taken along a coaxial cable into an equipment rack where it is amplified and filtered by back - end electronics .",
    "the signal is then sent to a pc - based @xmath16-ms / s analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) that samples with @xmath17-bit resolution .",
    "finally , blocks of @xmath18 time samples are fourier transformed to the frequency domain to obtain spectra with @xmath19 points and @xmath20-khz resolution using a four - term blackman - harris window function .",
    "the lna input switches continuously between the antenna and an internal calibration position using switch sw2 in figure  [ figure_block_diagram ] .",
    "when in the calibration position , the lna receives sequentially two noise levels : 1 ) load and 2 ) load + noise source . in the load state , the noise comes from the output of a @xmath21-db attenuator , and in the load + noise source state the active noise source connected to the input of the attenuator is turned on for additional noise .",
    "the noise from the antenna only represents a few percent of the total power at the receiver output .",
    "most of the output power is due to out - of - band noise injected below @xmath21 mhz as part of the conditioning stage .",
    "this injected noise remains constant during the input switching and provides a stable signal level to the back - end electronics and digitizer , improving linearity and dynamic range in the measurements .",
    "each of the three input levels are measured for @xmath22 seconds , which corresponds to an antenna duty cycle of @xmath23% .",
    "a total of @xmath24 spectra are accumulated for each position .",
    "an implicit assumption of this switching scheme is that the amplification chain remains stable within each @xmath25-second cycle .    the circuitry for measurement of antenna reflections , shown in figure  [ figure_block_diagram ] , functions as a remote calibration unit for a vector network analyzer ( vna ) .",
    "it is centered around a four - position mechanical rf switch where three of the ports are connected to open , short , and matched calibration standards , and the fourth port serves as a pass - through to the antenna .",
    "the efficiency of the instrument is highest below @xmath26 mhz .",
    "therefore , the calibration described in the rest of this paper was conducted in the range @xmath2 mhz .      here",
    "we summarize the calibration strategy used by edges , which is based on the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "for each three - position cycle of the receiver , the power spectral density ( psd ) from the antenna ( @xmath27 ) , load ( @xmath28 ) , and load + noise source ( @xmath29 ) , are used to compute an initial _ uncalibrated _ antenna temperature ,    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent realistic assumptions for the noise temperatures of the load and noise source , respectively .",
    "this computation serves to calibrate out the time - dependent system gain , which includes the complex bandpass of the filters , amplifiers , cables , and adc .",
    "all the parameters in equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) , and in what follows , are frequency - dependent .",
    "we do not explicitly show this dependence for simplicity of notation .    to derive the expression for calibration of @xmath33 it is necessary to write the psds in equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) in terms of the specific instrument response contributions .",
    "the psd for the antenna is given by :    @xmath34 , \\label{equation_power_antenna}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 corresponds to the calibrated antenna temperature .",
    "the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the system gain referenced to the receiver input , and the receiver noise offset , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 is the reflection coefficient of the antenna and @xmath40 is the reflection coefficient of the receiver , both referenced to a @xmath41-@xmath42 system impedance .",
    "the temperatures @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are called noise wave parameters following the formalism introduced by @xcite .",
    "they are associated with the noise emitted by the lna input toward the antenna .",
    "this noise is reflected back due to imperfect impedance match and re - enters the receiver with phase @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath43 temperature represents the portion of input noise that is uncorrelated with the noise at the lna output , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are components of the correlated portion .",
    "the psds for the internal load and load + noise source follow the same form as equation  ( [ equation_power_antenna ] ) .",
    "however , at this stage we assume that the reflection coefficients of the load and noise source are zero . in reality , they are not zero but very low ( @xmath47 db ) .",
    "thus , these psds are modeled as :    @xmath48,\\label{equation_power_internal_calibrators1}\\\\ p_{\\text{l+ns } } & = g^*\\left[\\left(t_{\\text{l } } + t_{\\text{ns}}\\right)\\left(1-|\\gamma_{\\text{rec}}|^2\\right ) + t_0^*\\right].\\label{equation_power_internal_calibrators2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in these equations , the system gain ( @xmath49 ) and noise offset ( @xmath50 ) are not exactly the same as in equation  ( [ equation_power_antenna ] ) because the noise from the internal references is injected at sw2 instead of at the receiver input itself .",
    "this aspect , in addition to the assumption for the reflection coefficients , is accounted for below with the introduction of two new parameters fitted during calibration that are able to absorb these small effects .    plugging the three psd definitions into equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) results in the following identity :    @xmath51 \\nonumber\\\\ + \\ ; & t_{\\text{unc}}\\left[\\frac{|\\gamma_{\\text{ant}}|^2|f|^2}{\\left(1-|\\gamma_{\\text{rec}}|^2\\right)}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\ ; & t_{\\cos}\\left[\\frac{|\\gamma_{\\text{ant}}||f|}{\\left(1-|\\gamma_{\\text{rec}}|^2\\right)}\\cos\\alpha\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\ ; & t_{\\sin}\\left[\\frac{|\\gamma_{\\text{ant}}||f|}{\\left(1-|\\gamma_{\\text{rec}}|^2\\right)}\\sin\\alpha\\right ] .",
    "\\label{equation_main_identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation establishes the relationship between the uncalibrated antenna temperature @xmath33 , computed with equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) , and the calibrated antenna temperature @xmath36 at the receiver input .",
    "more generically , @xmath36 represents the calibrated noise temperature of any device under measurement at the receiver input . any losses in the device under measurement have to be corrected for externally .",
    "the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 introduced on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) represent a scale and an offset that correct the first - order assumptions used for @xmath54 and @xmath32 in equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] )",
    ". they also account for the small path difference between the internal calibration position of sw2 and the receiver input .",
    "finally , they also account to first order for the non - zero reflection coefficient of the internal load and noise source .",
    "unaccounted higher - order effects are expected to be negligible due to the low reflection coefficients of these devices .",
    "the reflection coefficient of the receiver input and the antenna are measured directly with a vna . @xmath55 and @xmath46 ( equations ( [ equation_f ] ) and ( [ equation_alpha ] ) )",
    "are computed from these coefficients .",
    "therefore , the remaining calibration task consists of estimating the scale @xmath52 , offset @xmath53 , and the noise wave parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , in order to apply equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) . to solve for these five frequency - dependent quantities we conduct laboratory measurements of four absolute calibration standards connected to the input of the receiver in place of the antenna .",
    "following @xcite , the four calibrators are : 1 ) an ambient load , 2 ) a hot load , 3 ) a long ( @xmath56 @xmath57-m ) open - ended coaxial cable , and 4 ) the same long cable but short - circuited at its far end .",
    "the ambient and hot loads provide the main temperature references , while the open and shorted cable produces ripples in its spectra that manifest the noise properties of the receiver and enable the estimation of the noise wave parameters .",
    "the specific quantities that need to be measured for receiver calibration are :    1 .   the uncalibrated temperature spectra for each calibrator @xmath58@xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62@xmath63 via equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) , 2 .   the physical or noise temperature of the calibrators @xmath58@xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67@xmath63 , and 3 .   the reflection coefficient of the calibrators @xmath58@xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71@xmath63 .",

    "and [ equation_available_power_gain ] ) .",
    "the nomenclature given in the figure corresponds to the device operating as a hot load.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in this section we report details of the laboratory measurements .",
    "we begin by describing the calibrator used as ambient and hot load .",
    "we then discuss the measurements of spectra , physical temperature , and reflection coefficient of the calibrators .",
    "we also introduce the main sources of uncertainty for each calibration measurement , but defer detailed discussion to section  [ section_uncertainty_propagation ] .",
    "we conclude the section with the calculation and modeling of the five frequency - dependent receiver calibration quantities .      the ambient and hot loads used for receiver calibration",
    "are implemented as a single device , depicted in figure  [ figure_hot_load_device ] .",
    "it consists of an rf termination of @xmath41-@xmath42 nominal impedance connected to an @xmath57-cm semi - rigid cable inside a thermally insulated metal enclosure .",
    "when acting as an ambient load the device operates at room temperature ( @xmath56 @xmath76  k ) and when used as a hot load the termination is heated up to @xmath56 @xmath16  k by powering a resistor that is thermally connected to the termination .",
    "the effective noise temperature of the device when operating as a hot load ( @xmath77 ) is related to the physical temperature of the termination ( @xmath78 ) and the physical temperature of the cable ( @xmath79 ) by    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the available power gain of the assembly , defined as @xcite :    @xmath82    in this equation , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are two of the s - parameters of the cable , with port  1 attached to the rf termination and port  2 corresponding to the output connector of the device .",
    "@xmath85 is the reflection coefficient of the termination alone and @xmath69 is the reflection coefficient of the device as a whole .",
    "the uncalibrated temperature spectra of the absolute calibrators are measured by connecting each calibrator to the receiver input in place of the antenna .",
    "these measurements involve the same internal three - position switching as with the antenna , where in each @xmath25-second cycle the setup measures the psd of the calibrator and the two internal noise references .",
    "after the measurements , equation  ( [ equation_uncalibrated_temperature ] ) is applied offline to produce the uncalibrated temperature spectra .",
    "the noise temperatures assumed for the internal load and noise source at this step are @xmath86  k and @xmath87  k , constant across frequency .",
    "the final uncalibrated spectra , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , are obtained by averaging @xmath88 hours of data from each calibrator .",
    "this is done in order to reduce thermal noise .",
    "residual noise is the main source of uncertainty in these quantities .    the physical temperatures , @xmath64 , @xmath78 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , are measured using thermistors attached to the termination of the ambient / hot load and to the long cable .",
    "these measurements are conducted in parallel to the spectra measurement of each calibrator and with a similar time resolution .",
    "they are averaged in time to have a direct correspondence with the spectra averages .",
    "uncertainties in these measurements are dominated by potential inaccuracies in the resistance - to - temperature model used for the thermistors and unaccounted thermal gradients in the calibrators .",
    "the reflection coefficients and s - parameters required in the calibration are measured with a vna . in each measurement , hundreds of traces",
    "are averaged to reduce the noise to levels so that they are an insignificant source of uncertainty .",
    "the calibrators are passive devices and , thus , they are measured using a typical vna power of @xmath89 dbm ( @xmath4 mw ) .",
    "in contrast , the receiver input has to be measured at @xmath90 dbm to avoid saturating the active electronics designed for low - level signals .",
    "lower vna power results in higher measurement noise , but we compensated through averaging .",
    "we calibrate the vna immediately before every measurement and , thus , do not assume long - term vna stability .",
    "the main uncertainty associated with these measurements arises from imperfect vna calibration .    the isolation between the inputs of each of the mechanical switches ( sw1 and sw2 in figure  [ figure_block_diagram ] ) is about @xmath91 db .",
    "however , we assume that the isolation is perfect , which has a negligible impact on the calibration .",
    "the switching repeatability is assessed through high - precision s - parameter measurements and the scatter is found to be within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "we model and fit the uncalibrated temperature spectra , the reflection coefficients , and the s - parameters , to avoid propagating measurement noise to the fiducial calibration quantities and to bring all the measurements to the same frequency resolution . due to the smooth frequency behavior of the ambient and hot load spectra , and of the s - parameters of the semi - rigid cable , we model these measurements as polynomials in frequency . on the other hand , we use fourier series in frequency to model the spectra of the open and shorted cable , as well as all the reflection coefficients .",
    "fourier series are more efficient than polynomials at capturing the higher frequency structure encountered in these measurements .",
    "the model parameters are computed through least squares using qr decomposition for better numerical stability .",
    "the fit residuals for the spectra are noise - like .",
    "they are accounted for as a source of uncertainty in the mc analysis of section  [ section_uncertainty_propagation ] . for the reflection coefficients and s - parameters , the rms residuals are @xmath92 db in magnitude and @xmath93 in phase",
    "their effects are negligible compared to that from the uncertainty in vna calibration , addressed in section  [ section_uncertainty_propagation ] .      : scale , @xmath53 : offset , @xmath43 : uncorrelated noise wave , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 : components of the correlated noise wave .",
    "they satisfy equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) when it is evaluated using the lab measurements of the absolute calibrators .",
    "all the quantities in this figure are used as the fiducial quantities in the uncertainty propagation analysis discussed in section  [ section_uncertainty_propagation].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the frequency - dependent calibration quantities ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) are computed from the modeled laboratory measurements through an iterative process .",
    "specifically , in each iteration the scale and offset are computed as    @xmath96    here , @xmath77 is the noise temperature of the hot load from equation  ( [ equation_cable_loss ] ) , @xmath64 is the physical temperature of the ambient load , and @xmath97 are @xmath98 are the calibrated temperature spectra of the ambient and hot loads from equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) evaluated at the @xmath99 iteration .",
    "the initial values are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the noise wave parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) also take an initial value of zero , and in subsequent iterations they are modeled as polynomials in frequency .",
    "the polynomial coefficients are computed through a least squares fit to equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) evaluated using the measurements of the open and shorted cable and the current values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this process converges in three iterations , after which @xmath52 and @xmath53 are also modeled as polynomials in frequency .    to find the optimum number of terms in the polynomials ,",
    "the calibration quantities are modeled with increasing number of terms until the rms difference between the physical temperature and the calibrated temperature spectra of the calibrators themselves reaches a minimum .",

    "section  [ section_calibration_measurements ] presented the computation of the receiver calibration quantities from laboratory measurements and introduced potential sources of uncertainty . in this section , we discuss these uncertainties in more detail and assess their impact on the final calibrated antenna temperature spectrum through a set of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",

    "next , inside the block labeled mc , the antenna temperature is recalibrated with equation  ( [ equation_main_identity ] ) but using calibration quantities and reflection coefficients that potentially differ from their fiducial values due to simulated errors or noise estimated from our measurement uncertainties .",
    "this step is conducted for thousands of mc realizations of the perturbed calibration measurements .",

    "finally , for each simulated output spectrum , we fit and subtract a polynomial to match the foreground subtraction procedure applied to actual measurements .",
    "we use the resulting residuals to quantify the magnitude of the propagated calibration errors .",

    "field performance will be discussed in forthcoming papers that present the analysis of sky measurements .",
    "the rest of this section provides details of the simulations .",

    "the right column shows the residuals for the same two cases after fitting and removing equation  ( [ equation_model2 ] ) with five terms .",
    "several trends can be identified from table  [ table_residuals ] . first and as expected , for most error sources and polynomial orders the residuals are larger when observing a loud sky .",
    "this motivates the preference of low - foreground observations for estimation of the cosmological signal , or the downweighting of strong - foreground regions as suggested , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the table also makes evident the low sensitivity of the calibration to errors in measurements of the open and shorted cable . as stated before , the residuals for their spectra ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) remain consistently below @xmath4 mk and are not shown in the table . for their physical temperatures ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) the initial residuals are @xmath158 mk and for the reflections ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) they are @xmath159 mk . at five terms they all reach @xmath4 mk or less .",
    "the largest initial residuals occur for errors in the physical temperatures of the ambient and hot loads ( @xmath64 , @xmath78 ) which , for the loud sky , reach up to @xmath160 k. however , as shown in figure  [ figure_residuals ] , they strongly follow a power law and can be removed with few terms .",
    "specifically , three terms are needed to reduce the residuals to @xmath161 mk for our foreground model .",
    "the same applies to the transmission coefficient magnitude of the cable inside the ambient / hot load ( @xmath130 ) since this quantity is involved in the computation of the hot load noise temperature ( section  [ section_absolute_hot_load ] ) .",

    "these residuals decrease slowly as terms are added .",
    "more than five terms would be needed to reach @xmath4 mk . for the reflections of these loads ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) the initial residuals are significantly higher ( up to @xmath164 mk )",

    "they drop to @xmath167 mk with five terms .    in the full uncertainty propagation ,",
    "errors in reflection coefficients are assumed uncorrelated .",

    "this exercise simulates a case where all these measurements are affected by the same vna bias .",
    "the results are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to those shown in the table , thus not shown for brevity .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite through simulations , over a frequency range similar to edges high - band and with sub mk channel noise , it is possible to probe a significant range of eor models when the foreground and instrument spectral response are simultaneously modeled with less than six polynomial terms .",
    "some recent cosmological models yield large or late absorption features , or rapid reionization histories within the edges high - band range @xcite .",
    "these models should also be accessible with a similar instrument performance .",
    "the edges beam chromaticity has been modeled by @xcite to be less than @xmath4 mk at quiet sky locations after a fit to equation  ( [ equation_model2 ] ) with five terms .",
    "ideally , this number of terms and residual level should not increase due to systematics from receiver calibration .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid being limited by receiver systematics , the natural goal for the receiver calibration performance corresponds to keeping the residuals below @xmath4 mk after a fit to equation  ( [ equation_model2 ] ) with five terms .",
    "this goal is already being met for most of the measurements .",
    "the three exceptions correspond to 1 ) the spectra of the ambient and hot loads , 2 ) the reflection coefficient of the receiver , and 3 ) the reflection coefficient of the antenna .",
    "simulations indicate that reducing the impact of noise in the ambient and hot load spectra to @xmath161 mk with five terms requires lowering the noise level to @xmath168% of its nominal value . with the current digitization efficiency , this is equivalent to integrating for more than @xmath169 days , since the nominal value is the result of one day of integration .",
    "meeting this requirement is realistic and planned for future calibration revisions .    the situation is more challenging for the reflection coefficients .",
    "it would be necessary to reduce the magnitude and phase uncertainties to @xmath170% and @xmath171% of the nominal values , respectively .",
    "achieving such tight tolerances is an area of active research and we are identifying promising techniques .",
