    "we analyze the passive stability of a class of elastic bodies moving in a perfect fluid . our primary motivation is to examine the role of body elasticity as a mechanism for passively stabilizing the coast motion of fish .",
    "fish seem to alternate between actively swimming (  burst \" ) and passively responding (  coast \" ) to the surrounding fluid  a cycle known as the  burst and coast \" cycle , see  @xcite .",
    "it is of course difficult to gauge whether the coast motion is entirely passive , that is , whether or not the fish employs active control for stabilization purposes ; see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "yet , experimental evidence seems to suggest the existence of some mechanisms for passive stabilization in fish motion .",
    "for example , @xcite reported upstream motion of anesthetized fish ( undeniably passive ) in vortical flows and mentioned that the elastic properties of the fish body are essential to achieve this motion .",
    "indeed , the motion of elongated _ rigid _ bodies in unsteady flows is known to be _ passively unstable _ , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "body elasticity may not be the only mechanism responsible for passively stabilizing such motion .",
    "other physical mechanisms such as the effects of the fish wake or the boundary layer effects may also be at play . in this paper , we focus solely on the role of body elasticity in the passive stability of the coast motion .",
    "this is of course a mathematical idealization while , in reality , the effects of body elasticity , viscosity and vortex shedding are all coupled and operate simultaneously .",
    "this mathematical idealization is aimed to untangle the effects of body elasticity on the stability of motion and is viewed as a first step in constructing models with higher degrees of complexity and fidelity to the physical system .",
    "we model the fish as an articulated body formed of @xmath0 rigid links , say , identical ellipses of major- and minor - axes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the links are connected via @xmath3 hinge joints with torsional springs at the joints ( with stiffness @xmath4 ) to emulate the elasticity of the fish body .",
    "the articulated body is submerged in an unbounded volume of incompressible , inviscid fluid at rest at infinity .",
    "the dynamics of this body - fluid system admits a family of relative equilibrium solutions where the body , in its elongated configuration , is steadily moving along its major axis of symmetry , see figure  [ fig : equilibria ] .",
    "we refer to these translational motions as the coast motion .",
    "we examine the effects of the springs elasticity on the stability of the coast motion .",
    "we focus on passive stability , that is to say , the stability of motion when the deformable body is subject to initial conditions only and is passively responding to the surrounding fluid .",
    "this is in contrast to a deformable body that is actively controlling its shape to swim ( see  @xcite ) or to stabilize its motion ( see  @xcite ) . while the motion of a single rigid body , see figure  [ fig : equilibria]@xmath5 is known to be passively unstable , we find that , for the elastic body , there exists a range of parameter values ",
    "spring stiffness versus body geometry  for which the coast motion is passively stable .",
    "we examine the regions of stability for a two - link and a three - link body .",
    "we find that the stable region of the two - link body is characterized by a bending mode of deformations .",
    "for the three - link body , there exists two stable regions , one is characterized by a bending mode of deformation and the second by a traveling - wave mode of deformation .",
    "this problem is somewhat reminiscent to that of the fluttering flag instability .",
    "the latter has been the focus of a large number of experimental ( @xcite ) , computational ( @xcite ) , and theoretical ( @xcite ) investigations . of course , the flag is held stationary at one end in an incoming uniform flow field whereas the fish is freely moving .",
    "this constraint does alter the forces applied on the flag and , in turn , may significantly influence the stability results .",
    "for example ,  @xcite and  @xcite showed that the stability of the freely moving fppl equilibria is distinct from the stability of the stationary equilibria in an incoming uniform flow field .",
    "further , the flag is assumed to be heavy whereas the fish is neutrally - buoyant .",
    "the hydrodynamic forces acting on the flag are thus dominated by vortex shedding rather than the added mass effect .",
    "all is to say that , while the fish and flag are somewhat conjugates , the fluttering flag instability ( typically analyzed as a function of the flag s rigidity versus weight ) can not be readily translated to the stability of the moving fish which we analyze in this work as a function of the body stiffness versus geometry .",
    "consider an articulated body moving in an unbounded volume of incompressible , inviscid fluid at rest at infinity .",
    "the articulated body is composed of @xmath6 identical ellipses ( with semi - axes @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of uniform density @xmath7 equal to that of the fluid . that is to say , the articulated body is neutrally - buoyant .",
    "the ellipses or links forming the body are connected via @xmath3 massless and frictionless hinge joints placed at a distance @xmath8 from the ellipses centers along the major axes and equipped with torsional springs of constant stiffness @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be an orthonormal inertial frame where @xmath12 spans the plane of motion .",
    "the configuration of the articulated body can then be described by @xmath13 position coordinates @xmath14 of the ellipses centers and @xmath0 orientation variables @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) defined as the angles between the ellipses major axes of symmetry and the @xmath17-axis , see figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "this set of @xmath18 coordinates is subject to @xmath19 holonomic constraints due to the presence of the hinge joints connecting the ellipses .",
    "these constraints are implicitly accounted for when describing the body s configuration in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 relative angles @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) that denote the angles between every two consecutive links of the body .",
    "the coordinates @xmath24 coincide with the inertial coordinates of the first ellipse and are called locomotion coordinates while the relative angles @xmath25 describe only the shape of the articulated body . for notational convenience , we introduce the @xmath26-dimensional configuration vector @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the transpose and the @xmath3-dimensional shape vector @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient for deriving the equations of motion in ",
    "[ sec : eom ] to write the velocity of the articulated body in terms of an orthonormal body - fixed frame @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) whose origin is attached at @xmath32 and such that @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath33 and @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the components of the translational velocity vector @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of the center of each ellipse expressed in the body frame @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , let @xmath37 . also , let @xmath38 denote the angular velocity vector of each ellipse .",
    "one has @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . here , the dot notation @xmath42 is used to denote derivative with respect to time @xmath43 .",
    "we now construct a @xmath18-dimensional velocity vector @xmath44 .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath45 can be related to the velocity vector @xmath46 via a @xmath47 transformation matrix @xmath48 , function of @xmath21 and @xmath49 only , namely , @xmath50 for example , in the case of an articulated body made of two ellipses connected via one hinge joint , the @xmath51 transformation matrix @xmath48 is @xmath52 this transformation matrix can be readily generalized to arbitrary but finite @xmath3 .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for the fluid - mass system using hamilton s least action principle for which the lagrangian function is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the kinetic energy of the fluid - mass system , whereas @xmath55 denotes the potential energy stored in the springs and can be written in matrix form as @xmath56 where the stiffness matrix @xmath57 is an @xmath58 diagonal matrix with entries @xmath59 corresponding to the stiffness of the torsional springs at the hinge joints .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath60 of the articulated body is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a @xmath63 diagonal mass matrix with @xmath64 block diagonal entries of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the actual mass and moment of inertia of each ellipse .    in potential flow ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the fluid @xmath68 can be written , using standard vector identities and techniques ( see for example  @xcite and  @xcite ) , as a function of the configuration and velocity of the submerged body , @xmath69 the added mass matrix @xmath70 is a @xmath71 symmetric matrix that accounts for the presence of the fluid",
    ". differently said , in potential flow , the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the surfaces of the accelerating bodies can be completely accounted for by ` adding mass ' to the submerged bodies ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "the entries of the added mass matrix @xmath72 depend on the shape of the articulated body which may be changing in time as dictated by the evolution of the shape variable @xmath49 .",
    "we compute the entries of @xmath73 numerically using a panel method , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , although the added mass effect captures all the hydrodynamic forces in the potential flow environment , this is not the case in real viscous fluids where one needs to account for additional drag forces and forces induced by vortex shedding and vortex wakes as discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .    adding   and   and substituting   into the resulting expression , the total kinetic energy @xmath74 of the fluid - mass system can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an @xmath77 mass matrix as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath49 only since the transformation matrix @xmath48 depends only on @xmath21 and @xmath49 .",
    "the lagrangian function can then be expressed as @xmath78 in the absence of external forces and moments acting on the fluid - body system , the equations of motion are given by the @xmath26 euler - lagrange equations , @xmath79 this class of problems is energy - preserving , hence the total energy @xmath80 is conserved .",
    "it also admits two integrals of motion since the entries of the @xmath77 mass matrix @xmath76 depend exclusively on @xmath21 and @xmath49 and not on the position @xmath32 of the articulated body .",
    "the coordinates @xmath81 are thus ignorable coordinates of the lagrangian @xmath82 and the associated linear momenta @xmath83 and @xmath84 are conserved .",
    "these two symmetries reflect the fact that the system s dynamics is invariant to rigid translations of the whole body .",
    "additionally , the system possesses a rotational symmetry or invariance to rigid rotations of the whole body .",
    "this rotational symmetry is associated with conservation of the system s total angular momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the conservation of linear and angular momenta @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be used to eliminate the variables @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath21 from the equations of motion .",
    "that is to say , the @xmath26 second - order differential equations of motion obtained from   can be rewritten , by virtue of these three conserved quantities and a standard procedure , as @xmath91 first - order differential equations governing the body - frame velocities @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the shape variables @xmath95 and their time derivatives @xmath96 .",
    "namely , one can rewrite   in the form @xmath97 where we introduced the compact notation @xmath98 the function @xmath99 is a nonlinear @xmath91 vector - valued function of @xmath100 whose explicit form is omitted here for brevity .",
    "to get an idea of the form of these equations , note that when the articulated body is formed of a single ellipse with no deformation variables , that is to say , the body is rigid , reduce to three first - order differential equations in @xmath101 which are exactly the kirchhoff s equations of motion for a submerged elliptic body ; see , for example ,  @xcite . for an articulated body with @xmath3 joints , the three ` kirchhoff - like ' equations",
    "are coupled to @xmath19 first - order differential equations governing the shape deformations @xmath95 of the body , @xmath3 of these equations are simply stating that the time derivate of @xmath49 is equal to @xmath102 .    equation   admits a family of relative equilibrium solutions of the form @xmath103^t$ ] , where @xmath104 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "this relative equilibrium corresponds to the motion that the articulated body in its elongated configuration when all its links are translating along their semi - major axis at an arbitrary coast speed @xmath104 , with zero rotation and zero relative angles .",
    "we refer to this family of equilibria as the coast motion because it reminds of the coast phase in the fish burst and coast cycle .",
    "our goal in the next section is to understand the role of elasticity in the passive stability of these equilibria .",
    "we use linearization techniques to examine the stability of the equilibrium @xmath105^t$ ] to the initial perturbations .",
    "we begin by presenting numerical evidence , via numerically integrating the nonlinear equations  , that the system is indeed passively stable for certain parameter values .",
    "before we proceed , we non - dimensionalize the equations of motion   by scaling the length with @xmath1 ( the length of the semi - major axis of the ellipses ) and the time with @xmath106 whereas the mass is scaled with @xmath107 .",
    "all the parameters and variables can then be written in non - dimensional form accordingly .",
    "for example , one gets @xmath108      \\tilde{m}_{\\rm ellipse } & = \\frac{\\rho\\pi ab}{\\rho\\pi a^2}=\\tilde{b},\\quad \\tilde{j}_{\\rm ellipse } = \\frac{\\rho\\pi ab ( a^2+b^2)/4}{\\rho \\pi a^4}=\\dfrac{\\tilde{b } ( 1+\\tilde{b}^2)}{4 } , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] entries in the added mass matrix can be made non - dimensional in a similar way . in this study , we assume @xmath109 . note that , after this scaling , the number of independent parameters reduces to the geometric parameter @xmath110 and the spring stiffness @xmath111 .",
    "we want to understand the passive stability of the relative equilibrium @xmath112^t$ ] as a function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 . for convenience",
    ", we drop the tilde  @xmath113   notation with the understanding that all variables are non - dimensional hereafter .",
    "recall that for a single rigid ellipse ( see figure  [ fig : equilibria]@xmath5 ) , this relative equilibrium is unstable for all @xmath114 . due to the coupling between the translation and rotational motions in kirchhoff s equations ,",
    "an initial perturbation causes an elliptic rigid body to tumble when moving along its elongated direction , @xcite .",
    "the stability of this equilibrium is more interesting when the body is deformable .",
    "we begin by examining the case of an articulated body made of two rigid ellipses ( of non - dimensional minor axis @xmath2 ) connected via one hinge joint equipped with a torsional spring ( of non - dimensional stiffness @xmath115 ) . because there is only one spring ] the relative equilibrium in non -",
    "dimensional form is @xmath116^t$ ] .",
    "we examine the passive behavior of the articulated body when we impose a small initial perturbation @xmath117 to this equilibrium , for instance , @xmath118 .",
    "figures  [ fig : trajectory ] and  [ fig : angle ] show the response of the nonlinear equations of motion   for three different sets of parameter values , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , subject to initial conditions @xmath123 .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy ] shows the exchange of energy for each of these cases . given the non - dissipative nature of the model ,",
    "the total energy @xmath124 is constant in time .",
    "but , there is exchange between the kinetic and potential energies of the system and consequently between the shape deformations and translational and rotational motions . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the motion of the articulated body ( figure  [ fig : trajectory]@xmath126 ) remains close to the relative equilibrium and the body deformation @xmath127 and rotational motion @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig : angle]@xmath126 ) remain bounded for the duration of this time integration .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : energy]@xmath126 shows that the energy exchange is just right to set the body into deformation , that is to say , to set @xmath127 into oscillations , in response to the initial perturbation without causing the body to move far from the equilibrium solution . for the soft spring @xmath120 ,",
    "the articulated body moves away from the equilibrium trajectory ( figure  [ fig : trajectory]@xmath5 ) while undergoing large deformations @xmath127 and large rotations @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig : angle]@xmath5 ) which in turn are coupled to the translational motion .",
    "this behavior indicates that the relative equilibrium is unstable for these parameter values .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy]@xmath5 shows that the deformation potential energy @xmath55 is comparable in value to the system s kinetic energy , which , by conservation of total energy , indicates that the coupling between the shape deformations and the rotational and translational motion causes the system to move away from the equilibrium .",
    "for the stiff spring @xmath128 , the articulated body also moves away from the equilibrium ( figure  [ fig : trajectory]@xmath129 ) but in a way similar to the tumbling instability observed in the case of a single rigid body .",
    "indeed , the body deformation @xmath127 is small in comparison to its rotational motion ( figure  [ fig : angle]@xmath129 ) , and as in the case of a rigid body , it is the coupling between the rotational and translational motion that induces the instability , as evidenced from the energy exchange in figure  [ fig : energy]@xmath129 .",
    "this is not surprising , for larger @xmath115 , the articulated body is more rigid and its behavior approaches that of a rigid body .",
    "similar results are obtained for various values of the initial perturbations @xmath117 ( results not shown ) .    we assess the linear stability of these trajectories .",
    "we let @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is small , substitute @xmath132 into   and neglect higher order terms .",
    "the linearized equations of motion can be expressed as @xmath133 where the _ jacobian _ @xmath134 is a @xmath135 matrix , and it has 5 eigenvalues @xmath136 .",
    "given the conservative nature of the system ( no energy dissipation ) , the corresponding relative equilibrium is said to be marginally stable if all eigenvalues of the linearized system have non - positive real parts .",
    "if at least one eigenvalue has positive real part , the equilibrium is linearly unstable .",
    "remember that linear instability implies nonlinear instability but linear stability does not necessarily indicate nonlinear stability , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "of the two - link fish model .",
    "the regions for which the coast motion is linearly stable are highlighted in grey . ]        for the two - link articulated body , we find that one of the eigenvalues is always 0 , which reflects the symmetry associated with the fact that the equilibrium is invariant to translations in the direction of @xmath33 .",
    "the other eigenvalues depend on the two non - dimensional parameters of the system : the aspect ratio @xmath2 of the ( identical ) ellipses and the spring stiffness @xmath115 .",
    "we conduct a parametric analysis of the stability as a function of the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath137 .",
    "namely , we discretize a region of the parameter space from @xmath138 $ ] and @xmath139 $ ] using increments of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and compute the eigenvalues of   for each point of the discrete parameter space to assess the stability of the system at that point .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : sr2 ] .",
    "two regions in the @xmath142 parameter space are found for which all eigenvalues have zero real part , which implies that the system is marginally stable in these regions .",
    "one region corresponds to @xmath143 and the other one lies in the area @xmath144 and resembles a  shark fin \" .",
    "the existence of the first stability region can be understood by analogy to a single ellipse . for a single ellipse ,",
    "the coast motion is stable when @xmath145 , which means a rigid body is stable when it has circular shape ( @xmath146 ) or when it is translating along its semi - minor axis . for the two - link case , when @xmath147 , the articulated body becomes more circular in shape , granted not exactly circular , and when @xmath148 , the two - link fish model is similar to a body moving along its minor - axis of symmetry .",
    "the  shark fin \" stability region is much more interesting . indeed",
    ", in contrast to a single rigid body which is unstable for all @xmath144 , this stability region indicates that the coast motion can be passively stable when @xmath144 by allowing the body to deform ( via the deformation variable @xmath127 ) and by proper choice of body elasticity @xmath115 . for a given aspect ratio , if @xmath115 is small ( weak spring ) , the deformations are large and the system is unstable .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath115 is too large ( stiff spring ) , the deformations are small and the model is similar to that of a rigid body , which is also unstable . for an intermediate range of @xmath115 values which provide the appropriate bending resistance to perturbations ,",
    "the system is stable .",
    "it is informative to look at the linear modes of oscillation in the  shark fin \" stable region .",
    "remember that one eigenvalue is zero , say @xmath149 .",
    "the remaining four eigenvalues are two pairs of pure imaginary complex conjugates , say , @xmath150 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath153 and @xmath154 be the complex conjugate eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively . @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the natural frequencies of oscillations and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the associated linear modes of oscillations , with the smaller frequency @xmath157 dictating the dominant mode of oscillation . when @xmath161 for which the equilibrium is linearly stable , the smaller frequency of oscillation is @xmath162 and the associated mode of oscillation is given by @xmath163^t$ ] , @xmath164^t$ ] .",
    "a sketch of this mode is depicted in figure  [ fig : sm2 ] .",
    "one can see that the two ellipses oscillate symmetrically about the hinge joint , that is to say , the dominant stable mode corresponds to a bending mode of deformation .    .",
    "( b ) planar cross section @xmath165 regions for which the coast motion is linearly stable are depicted in grey . ]",
    "we now ask how this stable region is affected when the articulated body has more deformation degrees of freedom . for concreteness , we consider an articulated body made of three identical links ( of minor axis @xmath2 ) connected via two hinge joints equipped with torsional springs of stiffnesses @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "one now has two deformation variables @xmath127 and @xmath168 and the independent variables are @xmath169^t$ ] .",
    "the parameter space is three - dimensional @xmath170 .",
    "we follow the same procedure as above to assess the linear stability of the coast motion as a function of this parameter space .",
    "interestingly , one finds two stable regions in the area where @xmath114 : a  shark fin \" region similar to the one obtained for the two - link model and a smaller region , see figure  [ fig : sr3 ] . to compare this stability result with the two - link case",
    ", we plot the cross section of the plane @xmath171 in figure  [ fig : sr3]@xmath126 .",
    "one can see that , in addition to the two stable regions when @xmath114 , a third stable region exists for @xmath172 which is analogous to the @xmath143 region in the two - link model .",
    "the  shark fin \" region is also analogous to the stable region in the two - link model , though its area is larger than the latter .",
    "however , the small stable region does not have an analogy in the two - link model .",
    "to better understand this difference , we plot the dominant oscillation modes for both regions in @xmath144 in figure  [ fig : sm3 ] .",
    "the dominant mode of oscillation in the  shark fin \" region is similar to that observed in the two - link model .",
    "namely , the two side ellipses are oscillating symmetrically relative to the middle ellipse which corresponds to a bending mode of deformation .",
    "figure  [ fig : sm3](a ) illustrates the dominant mode in the smaller region . here , the two side ellipses are oscillating anti - symmetrically relative to the middle ellipse , and the deformation mode corresponds to that of a traveling wave .",
    "this mode can not exist in the two - link model .",
    "an interesting question which remains unanswered in this work is how these stability results get affected as the number of hinge joints goes to infinity , that is to say , as the body becomes completely deformable .",
    "we speculate that similar results , with both traveling - wave and bending modes of deformations , will hold depending on the elastic properties of the deformable body .",
    "we used a deformable body consisting of an articulated body equipped with torsional springs at its hinge joints as a simple model to study the passive stability of the coast motion of an underwater swimmer .",
    "the coast motion , that is to say , the motion of a swimmer with constant velocity along its elongated direction , is known to be intrinsically unstable if the body is not deformable . through a combination of numerical examples and linear stability analysis",
    ", we showed that the coast motion can be passively stabilized .",
    "we highlight the following main points :    1 .",
    "the surrounding fluid , even in an inviscid and irrotational context , couples the deformation of the body and its translational and rotational motion and allows for energy exchange between these motions in a way that causes initial perturbations to the coast motion to remain bounded .",
    "elasticity of the body ( finite @xmath115 ) when properly chosen can be the essential ingredient for the passive stabilization of an otherwise unstable coast motion .",
    "3 .   the effects of viscous boundary conditions and the resulting generation of vorticity from the boundary layer region remain an open question .",
    "one may think that viscosity and dissipation could enhance passive stability by damping out initial perturbations .",
    "however , it has been shown that the hydrodynamic forces created by vorticity shed from a bluff body may cause vortex - induced vibrations ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) which may in turn have destabilizing effects .",
    "these vortex - induced vibrations may be especially significant where the swimmer has a bluff shape ( @xmath173 for the two - link and @xmath174 for the three - link ) .",
    "their effects on the motion of the more fusiform - shaped swimmer ( @xmath175 ) is less clear . on the one hand",
    ", the deformation modes may add to the bluffness of the swimmer s shape .",
    "on the other hand , separation and shedding may be hindered by a traveling - wave deformation if the wave speed is faster than the swimming speed ; see , for example , borazjani & sotiropoulos ( 2008 ) , ( 2009a , b ) ;  @xcite . in reality ,",
    "drag forces will slow down the passively swimming fish and passive locomotion can not be maintained . the fish will have to actively flap in order to overcome the drag forces and continue swimming  thus the burst phase in the burst and coast cycle . during the burst phase , the fish could potentially correct any destabilizing forces due to vortex shedding .",
    "4 .   while we restricted the discussion in this paper to planar motions , the main stabilizing mechanisms discussed here are also present in a three - dimensional environment but for only a subset of the 3d perturbations , namely , for planar perturbations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these passive mechanisms are not sufficient to stabilize out - of - plane perturbations and one needs to incorporate active control mechanisms .",
    "the next steps in the development of this class of models are to address three - dimensional motion planning , implement control strategies for both stabilization and produce complex maneuvers , such as turning and fleeing responses , as well as to examine multi - body synchronization ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) and its role in facilitating and/or stabilizing the coast motion .",
