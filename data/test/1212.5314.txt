    "the lognormal distribution appears in a wide range of natural and social phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in fluid turbulence , it is well - known that the distribution is an important consequence of the kolmogorov s 1962 theory for modeling fluctuations of the energy cascade rate across scales @xcite . in this 1962 theory , we have a very clear picture why the lognormal distribution was the first candidate of the cascade fluctuations in his refined phenomenology .",
    "namely , the energy cascade at high reynolds number can be modeled as a multiplicative process consisting of a large number of independently and identically distributed random variables .",
    "this large number is important for the central limit theorem to be applicable to the logarithm of the multiplicand .",
    "there is a different example of lognormally distributed variables in turbulence .",
    "laboratory experiments of turbulent boundary layers in 1980 s suggest that spanwise separations between the low - speed streaks follow the lognormal distribution @xcite . in this case , the underlying mechanism of the lognormally distributed streaks is not as clear as in the kolmogorov 1962 phenomenology because a multiplicative structure for the streaks is not found immediately .    in this paper",
    "we consider yet another lognormal example in turbulence , which was recently found experimentally @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is observed that the coarse - grained squared velocity and squared velocity increments over distance @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 ^ 2 d x \\label{du2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are lognormally distributed when the averaging scale @xmath2 is set to @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the correlation length defined as the integral scale of the velocity correlation function @xmath5 and the velocity @xmath6 can be either longitudinal or transverse velocity component . since the lognormal property holds when @xmath2 is comparable to the large scale @xmath4 , this property is called `` large - scale lognormality '' . for the asymptotic regime @xmath7 , as a usual result of the central limit theorem ,",
    "the distribution of the coarse - grained quantities become closer and closer to normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",
    "notice that the large - scale lognormality , which we consider here , concerns the range of the coarse - graining scale @xmath3 , which is different from the final gaussian state in @xmath7 .",
    "the large - scale lognormality was observed in the experiments of grid turbulence , turbulent boundary layers , and turbulent jets , suggesting its universality @xcite . but",
    "again as in the case of the streaks in the boundary layer turbulence , why the coarse - grained turbulence data are lognormally distributed is not clear . our final goal is to understand its mechanism why they are so .    as a first step to this goal",
    ", we address the following question : is the large - scale lognormality a general property of correlated random variables , not restricted to large - scale fluctuations of turbulence ?",
    "the previous results @xcite lead us to recognize that this balance between @xmath2 and @xmath8 is most important for the lognormality . in order to answer the question , we use the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( ou process ) as a simplest way to generate correlated random variables with the correlation length @xmath8 and check whether or not the coarse - grained quantities like eqs.([u2 ] ) and ( [ du2 ] ) follow lognormal distributions in the range @xmath9 .",
    "our numerical results suggest that the answer to the question is yes .",
    "then we study , by analytical calculations of moments , further details on how the ou data become close to the lognormal variables .",
    "we believe that this simple approach using the stochastic process has some value since reproducing the large - scale lognormality by direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations can be computationally quite expensive .",
    "it requires a very large domain size as compared with the correlation length .    in statistics , taking logarithm of a positive random variable is known as a common way of symmetrizing transformation , which makes the skewness of the transformed variable closer to zero @xcite . in this language , the large - scale lognormality suggests that , even with correlation , the log transformation can produce near gaussian behaviour successfully already when the averaging scale @xmath2 is of the order of the correlation scale @xmath8 .",
    "the present study can be interpreted as a model study how the log transformation begins to work for the correlated random variable by changing the coarse - graining scale .",
    "this paper s organization is the following . in sec .",
    "[ s : num ] , we present numerical data of the ou process reproducing the large - scale lognormality . we then in sec .",
