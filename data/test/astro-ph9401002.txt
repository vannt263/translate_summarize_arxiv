    "if pulsars or the central parts of these can be made of quark matter rather than neutrons @xcite , does this then apply to all or just some of them , and when and how does the phase transformation take place ?    according to some investigations @xcite , the transformation occurs during the supernova explosion . in this scenario ,",
    "the released binding energy is what makes the supernova succeed in the first place , supplying the final `` push '' which seems to lack in most of the computer simulations of the events .",
    "another model for strange star formation ( in the context of absolutely stable strange quark matter ) was introduced by baym _",
    "@xcite , describing the transformation as a slow burning ( combustion ) rather than a violent event connected with a supernova detonation .",
    "regardless of the way in which the transformation occurs , an initial seed of quark matter is needed to start it .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a variety of possibilities ranging from pressure induced conversion via two flavor quark matter to collision with either highly energetic neutrinos or smaller lumps of strange quark matter .",
    "however , they did not provide a rate for conversion of neutron stars and thus left it as an open question , whether every compact object is a strange star , or whether they are rare objects , even if quark matter formation is energetically favorable .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that strange matter seeds ( in the case of quark matter stability ) from strange star collisions or of cosmological origin would trigger the transformation of all neutron stars , in which case the thermal nucleation would be of relevance to the case of unstable quark matter only @xcite .",
    "other possibilities are that shock waves in the supernova trigger the conversion ; a seed could be produced by non - thermal quantum fluctuations , or a phase transition could be started around impurities .",
    "we are not able to estimate the probability of either method , but would expect at least quantum fluctuations to be less likely than the thermal nucleation process discussed below .    an estimate for quark matter formed via thermally induced fluctuations",
    "was given by horvath _",
    "@xcite , using typical numbers for various physical quantities .",
    "it was found that all neutron stars are converted into strange stars ( assuming stable strange quark matter ) if the temperature at some time during the stars lifetime has exceeded 2 - 3 mev .    in the following ,",
    "we choose an approach similar to the one in ref.@xcite , but with an extra term in the expression for the surface energy of quark matter , and with the two phases treated in a more self - consistent way . unlike most of the approaches mentioned above @xcite",
    ", we will be considering the formation of both strange stars ( for absolutely stable strange matter ) and hybrid stars , where strange matter is formed only in the central regions due to the high pressure .",
    "first , we will deal with some general aspects of nucleation ( sec .",
    "[ secboil ] ) . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "[ pure ] treats the problem using a simplified model with the hadron phase being a free degenerate neutron gas and the quark phase a bag model with only @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks . a more detailed model for the neutron star",
    "is presented in sec.[seccompli ] , followed by some concluding remarks ( sec .",
    "[ secclu ] ) .",
    "the free energy involved in formation of a spherical quark bubble of radius @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pressure difference , @xmath5 the surface tension , @xmath6 the curvature energy density , and @xmath7 the difference in chemical potential .",
    "@xmath8 is the total baryon number in the quark bubble .",
    "the indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the hadron and quark phase respectively .",
    "( we set @xmath11 = 0 in the thermodynamical expressions ; since @xmath12 throughout , this only leads to minor errors ) . defining @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 the free energy has a maximum at the critical radius @xmath15 and the corresponding free energy @xmath16 \\label{wcrit}\\ ] ] is the work required to form a bubble of this radius which is the smallest bubble capable of growing .",
    "it is a standard assumption in the theory of bubble nucleation in first order phase transitions that bubbles form at this particular radius at a rate given by @xcite    @xmath17    it is possible to show that @xmath18 has a minimum as a function of @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "this gives a maximum in the rate for bubble formation , and because of the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) one may safely assume that nucleation happens in chemical equilibrium .",
    "thus , @xmath21 reduces to @xmath22 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will consider the strange quark to be massless , in which case chemical equilibrium would give @xmath23 .",
    "however , equilibrium is established only on a weak interaction time scale , whereas the formation of bubbles is governed by the strong interaction and is many orders of magnitude faster .",
    "so , although we have chemical equilibrium between the two phases this is not so between the three quark flavors . instead",
    ", flavor must be conserved during the phase transition .",
    "a consequence of having massless quarks is that @xmath24 @xcite , and since @xmath25 is negligible compared to @xmath26 , eqs .",
    "( [ rcrit ] ) and ( [ wcrit ] ) reduce to    @xmath27    and    @xmath28",
    "before considering a more realistic equation of state it is instructive to study the nucleation of a pure neutron gas into quarks .",
    "the quark bubbles formed consist of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks in the ratio 1:2 ; only later weak interactions may change the composition to an energetically more favorable state .",
    "thus quark chemical potentials are related by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , assuming chemical equilibrium across the phase boundary .",
    "the pressure difference is given by    @xmath31    and the curvature energy coefficient @xcite    @xmath32    for the question in hand we choose the simplest possible equation of state for the neutron gas , namely that of a zero temperature , nonrelativistic degenerate fermi - gas , where    @xmath33    and the baryon density    @xmath34    a necessary condition for bubble nucleation is that @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to an upper limit on the bag constant , @xmath36 , from eq .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ neutron ] ( the corresponding limit for the bethe - johnson equation of state is shown for comparison ; it is seen to be very similar ) .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ neutron ] is the limit on the bag constant below which bubble nucleation takes place at rates exceeding 1 km@xmath37gyr@xmath38 and 1 m@xmath37s@xmath38 , respectively , for temperatures of 1 , 2 , 3 and 10 mev ( @xmath36 can be considered as the limit for infinite temperature ) .",
    "one notes that the possibility of bubble nucleation is fairly insensitive to the temperature as soon as @xmath11 exceeds a few mev , whereas thermally induced bubble nucleation is impossible for @xmath39 2 mev ( it is known from the stability of ordinary nuclei against decay into quark matter that @xmath40 ( 145 mev@xmath41 ) .",
    "this confirms the estimate in @xcite .",
    "the range of bag constants for which a hot neutron star may transform into quark matter is thus roughly 145 mev @xmath42 152 mev .",
    "an interesting feature of the solution is the existence of a maximum in @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that there is a _ range in densities _ for which boiling can take place for a fixed value of @xmath43 .",
    "if the central density of a neutron star exceeds the upper limit of @xmath44 permitting boiling , it may therefore happen that boiling is initiated off - center , with potentially interesting consequences for supernova energetics , neutrino fluxes , gamma - bursters etc .",
    "this may be explained as follows : with increasing density one has an increase in @xmath45 , and since @xmath46 while @xmath47 , higher densities must imply still lover @xmath36 in order to satisfy the condition , @xmath48 = 0 . that the maximum does not occur at the same density for all temperatures",
    "is due to the @xmath45-dependence of @xmath26 .",
    "this effect , however , occurs at much higher @xmath44 and @xmath43 for the more realistic equation of state discussed below , so we shall not pursue the issue further .",
    "in the following , a mean field model is used to describe the equation of state in the hadron phase .",
    "the model includes the light hadron octet and is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the quark phase , the only difference from sec .",
    "[ pure ] is that strange quarks are introduced in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) below .",
    "this leads to additional contributions to eqs .",
    "( [ deltap ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) .    integrating the oppenheimer - volkoff equation",
    "gives the structure of the initial neutron star : pressure , chemical potential , and number density of each hadron species as a function of radius .",
    "for a flavor conserving phase transformation , the relative number densities , @xmath49 , are given by    @xmath50    the absolute number densities are then given from equality between the chemical potential per baryon in the two phases .    doing a calculation similar to the one already done for a pure neutron star , one obtains a qualitatively similar result with the limits being independent of the nucleation rate considered for @xmath51 10 mev but with slightly higher values of @xmath36 , and with the maximum in @xmath43 at higher densities .",
    "[ bagcriteos ] ) .",
    "again , the temperature variation of the @xmath43-limits show that there is some critical temperature , @xmath52 , below which the conversion takes place only for extremely low values of the bag constant .",
    "this corresponds to the limit found by horvath _",
    "et al_.  @xcite although the method for obtaining it is quite different . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "increasing the value of @xmath11 brings the limits closer to the @xmath53 - curve .",
    "a typical temperature for a newborn neutron star is about 10 mev at the center with off - center temperatures up to 20 - 30 mev , but since we have just seen that the exact value is unimportant in the high @xmath11 limit , it is enough to consider only @xmath11 = 10 mev ( this agrees well with the choice of @xmath54 = 1 s , since a typical cooling time for newborn neutron stars is of this order @xcite ) . the constraints on a 1.4 @xmath55 neutron star is shown on fig .",
    "[ bagcritns ] . for @xmath56 165",
    "mev the center of the star is converted , and for lower values of the bag constant still larger fractions of the star will undergo the phase transition in the initial stage of its existence . at @xmath57 = 145 mev the entire star is transformed but for this value ordinary nuclei ( e.g.  @xmath58fe ) would probably be unstable @xcite . for different choices of the hyperon coupling constants , the limits on @xmath36 at the center vary from ( 162 mev@xmath41 to ( 170 mev@xmath41 , with high @xmath36 corresponding to low values of the hyperon - to - hadron coupling constant .",
    "thus a weaker coupling of the hyperons tends to destabilize hadronic matter .",
    "( the coupling constants mentioned above are chosen to fit the @xmath59 binding energy , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at larger radii ,",
    "the relative density of strange baryons decreases and the limits converge toward the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ bagcritns ] .",
    "so far , we have only considered @xmath60 since observational data seem to suggest this as the most typical value .",
    "the effect of varying the mass is displayed on fig .",
    "[ nsmass ] . for low masses ,",
    "the star consists almost only of neutrons , even at the center , and thus the deviation from ( 145 mev@xmath41 seen here is due only to a nonzero pressure , and it appears that in this case , a conversion via thermal bubble nucleation is less likely to take place . at masses near the maximum mass",
    "@xmath61 200 mev so here all but unrealistically high @xmath43 gives a transition into quark matter .    turning again to the case @xmath60 , it could be interesting to examine the effects of having a non - zero strong coupling constant , @xmath62 . for massless quarks",
    ", this gives corrections to the number density and pressure which to first order is given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 denotes the values for @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding expression for @xmath67 ( and in the case of massive quarks also @xmath68 ) is presently unknown and thus we can not correctly estimate the effect on the nucleation rate .",
    "what we can do , however , is to examine the @xmath53-curve , and thereby obtain limits on @xmath69 , since this is bound to be below the curve of equal pressure .",
    "it is seen that although both @xmath70 and the limiting bag constant for @xmath71 quark matter stability ( @xmath70 taken at @xmath72 corresponding to zero external pressure @xcite ) are decreasing functions of @xmath62 , one has a narrowing of the relevant interval in @xmath43 ( fig .  [ alpha ] ) , and above @xmath73 conversion of neutron stars seems to be ruled out .",
    "( similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the effect on @xmath74",
    "can only be guessed at , but assuming that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath74 should be correct within a factor of 2 , and thus the temperatures accompanying supernova explosions should still be enough to ensure conversion into strange stars ( or hybrid stars ) provided that the bag constant is below @xmath70 .",
    "what we have seen is that if the bag constant lies in the interval where three flavor but not two flavor quark matter is stable at zero pressure and temperature ( 145 mev @xmath42 163 mev , see ref.@xcite ) then all or parts of a neutron star will be converted into strange matter during the first seconds of its existence ( but note the cautionary remark in @xcite ) .",
    "the rest will then be transformed either by a slow burning on a time scale of a few seconds to a few minutes @xcite or by a detonation @xcite . for bag constants above the stability interval",
    ", we have seen that a partial transformation is still possible , but since this seems to depend heavily on the exact equation of state , one should be careful before drawing any definite conclusions .    since a large fraction of the star",
    "is converted on a relatively short time scale , the released energy may well provide a significant contribution to the total energy of a supernova ( cf.ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another investigation by krivoruchenko and martemyanov @xcite , taking @xmath53 as a criterion for a possible transformation into strange stars by a flavor conserving phase transition , have found similar results .",
    "this is an effect not as much of equivalence of the methods used , but rather of the fact , that the high temperatures of newborn neutron stars together with the exponential in eq .  ( [ prob ] ) causes the rate to be insensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "another interesting feature is that if a star is born with a mass that for a given bag constant is too small for the conversion to take place even in the center , then accretion from a neighboring star , leading to a higher mass for the neutron star and thus in principle a larger transition probability , will only lead to a phase transition via thermal nucleation _ if _ at the same time the neutron matter is heated to at least 2 - 5 mev by the energy released by the accretion process or by other mechanisms , such as capture of high energy neutrinos .",
    "( it is very unlikely that a significant mass can be transferred during the first second or so ) .",
    "thus , one may conclude that if no mechanism for a significant heating of the star can be found , the initial mass uniquely determines the future of the star if one has to rely solely on thermal nucleation .",
    "( other possible mechanisms that may lead to a transformation were mentioned in sec .",
    "[ secintro ] ) .    by introducing a non - zero @xmath62 ,",
    "a narrowing in the interesting range for @xmath43 was seen ; both as an absolute measure and in terms of the fraction of the interval where @xmath78 quark matter is stable at zero pressure .    in this work",
    "we have ignored the effect of the mass of the strange quark , which corresponds to a somewhat inadequate treatment of the equation of state , surface and curvature effects . however , even in the center of the star no more than 2 - 4 % of the quarks in the hadrons are @xmath79 quarks , and thus the effects during bubble nucleation are very small . as far as the surface energy is concerned , a more important effect comes from taking @xmath80 ( from typical nuclear mass formulae ) , but even here it turns out that @xmath81 , so that inclusion of such a term would not change our conclusions .",
