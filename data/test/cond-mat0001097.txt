    "electron transfer ( et ) is a very important process in biology , chemistry and physics @xcite .",
    "the most well known et theory is the one of marcus @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the et in configurations where a bridge ( b ) between donor ( d ) and acceptor ( a ) mediates the transfer . on this kind of et we will focus in this paper .",
    "the primary step of et in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers is of this type @xcite and a lot of work in this direction was done after the structure of the protein - pigment complex of the photosynthetic reaction centers of purple bacteria was clarified in 1984 @xcite .",
    "many artificial systems especially self - organized porphyrin complexes have been developed to model this bacterial photosynthetic reaction center @xcite .",
    "bridge - mediated et reactions can occur via different mechanisms @xcite : incoherent sequential transfer in which the bridge level is populated or coherent superexchange @xcite in which the mediating bridge level is not populated but nevertheless necessary for the transfer . changing",
    "a building block of the complex @xcite or changing the environment @xcite can modify which mechanism is mainly at work .",
    "actually , there is still a discussion in literature whether sequential transfer and superexchange are limiting cases of one process @xcite or whether they are two processes which can coexist @xcite . to clarify",
    "which mechanism is present in an artificial system one can systematically vary the energetics of the complex . in experiments",
    "this is done by substituting parts of the complexes @xcite or by changing the polarity of the solvent @xcite .",
    "also the geometry and size of the bridge block can be varied , and in this way the length of the subsystem through which the electron has to be transfered @xcite can be changed .",
    "superexchange occurs due to coherent mixing of the three or more states of the system @xcite .",
    "the et rate in this channel depends algebraically on the differences between the energy levels @xcite and decreases exponentially with increasing bridge length @xcite .",
    "when incoherent effects such as dephasing dominate the transfer is mainly sequential @xcite , i.  e. , the levels are occupied mainly in sequential order @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the differences between the energy levels is exponential @xcite .",
    "an increase of the bridge length induces only a small reduction in the et rate @xcite .",
    "this is why sequential transfer is the desired process in molecular wires @xcite .    in the superexchange case",
    "the dynamics is mainly hamiltonian and can be described on the basis of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the physically important results can be obtained by perturbation theory @xcite and , most successfully , by the semiclassical marcus theory @xcite .",
    "the complete system dynamics can be directly extracted by numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xcite . in case of sequential transfer",
    "the influence of an environment has to be taken into account .",
    "there are quite a few different ways how to include an environment modeled by a heat bath .",
    "the simplest phenomenological descriptions are based on the einstein coefficients or on the imaginary terms in the hamiltonian @xcite , as well as on the fokker - planck or langevin equations @xcite .",
    "the most accurate but also numerically most expensive way is the path integral method @xcite .",
    "this has been applied to bridge - mediated et especially in the case of bacterial photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "bridge - mediated et has also been investigated using redfield theory @xcite , by propagating a density matrix ( dm ) in liouville space @xcite and other methods ( e.  g.   @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is to present a simple , analytically solvable model based on the dm formalism @xcite and apply it to a porphyrin - quinone complex which is taken as a model system for the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center .",
    "the master equation which governs the dm evolution as well as the appropriate relaxation coefficients can be derived from such basic informations as system - environment coupling strength and spectral density of the environment @xcite . in the present model relaxation",
    "is introduced in a way similar to redfield theory but in site representation not in eigenstate representation .",
    "a discussion of advantages and disadvantages these representations has been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the equations for the dm are the same as in the generalized stochastic liouville equation ( gsle ) model @xcite for exciton transfer which is an extension of the haken - strobl - reineker ( hsr ) model @xcite to a model with a quantum bath . here",
    "we give an analytic solution to these equations .",
    "the present equations for the dm obtained are also similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite where relaxation is introduced in a phenomenological fashion but only a steady - state solution is found in contrast to the model introduced here .",
    "in addition the present model is applied to a concrete system .",
    "a comparison of the et time with the bath correlation time allows us to regard three time intervals of system dynamics : the interval of memory effects , the dynamical interval , and the kinetic , long - time interval @xcite . in the framework of dm theory",
    "one can describe the et dynamics in all three time intervals . however , often it is enough to find the solution in the kinetic interval for the explanation of experiments within the time resolution of most experimental setups , as has been done in ref .",
    "the master equation is analytically solvable only for simple models , for example @xcite .",
    "most investigations are based on the numerical solution of this equation @xcite . here",
    "we perform numerical as well as approximate analytical calculations for a simple model .",
    "since the solution can be easily obtained , the influence of all parameters on the et can be examined .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model of a supermolecule which we use to describe et processes .",
    "the properties of an isolated supermolecule are modeled in subsection [ chem - isolate ] , as well as the static influence of the environment .",
    "the dynamical influence of bath fluctuations is discussed and modeled by a heat bath of harmonic oscillators in section [ chem - sb ] .",
    "the reduced dm equation of motion ( rdmem ) describing the excited state dynamics is presented in subsection [ chem - rdm ] . in subsection",
    "[ chem - scaling ] the system parameter dependence on the solvent dielectric constant is discussed for different models of solute - solvent interaction . in subsection [ chem - parameters ]",

    "we discuss the dependence of the et rate on the solvent dielectric constant for different models of solute - solvent interaction and compare the calculated et rates with the experimentally measured ones .",

    "the photoinduced et in supermolecules consisting of three sequentially connected molecular blocks , i.  e. , donor , bridge , and acceptor , ( @xmath4 ) is analyzed .",
    "the donor is not able to transfer its charge directly to acceptor because of their spatial separation .",
    "donor and acceptor can exchange their charges only through b. in the present investigation the supermolecule consists of free - base tetraphenylporphyrin ( @xmath1 ) as donor , zinc substituted tetraphenylporphyrin ( @xmath2 ) as bridge , and p - benzoquinone as acceptor @xcite . in each of those molecular blocks we consider only two molecular orbitals ( @xmath5 ) , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) @xcite .",
    "each of these orbitals can be occupied by an electron or not , denoted by @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this model allows us to describe four states of each molecular block , the neutral ground state @xmath8 , the neutral excited state @xmath9 , the positively charged ionic state @xmath10 , and the negatively charged ionic state @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 describe the creation , annihilation , and number of electrons in orbital @xmath15 , respectively , while @xmath16 gives the number of electrons in a molecular block .",
    "the number of particles in the whole supermolecule is conserved , @xmath17 .",
    "each of the electronic states has its own vibrational substructure . as a rule for the porphyrin - containing systems",
    "the time of vibrational relaxation is two orders of magnitude faster than the characteristic et time @xcite .",
    "because of this we assume that only the ground vibrational states play a role and we do not include the vibrational substructure . a comparison of the models with and without vibrational substructure has been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "below we consider the evolution of single charge - transfer exciton states in the system .",
    "for the full description of the system one also should include photon modes to describe for example the fluorescence from the lumo to the homo in each molecular block transferring an excitation to the electro - magnetic field .",
    "but the rates of fluorescence and recombination are small in comparison to other processes for porphyrin - type systems @xcite .",
    "when fluorescence does not have to be taken into account , all states except @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) remain essentially unoccupied , while those three take part in the intermolecular transport process . in this case",
    "the number of states coincides with the number of sites in the system and we label the states @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 .    for the description of the et and other dynamical processes in the system placed in a dissipative environment we introduce the hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 describes the supermolecule , @xmath28 the dissipative bath , and @xmath29 their interaction .",
    "we are interested in the kinetic limit of the excited state dynamics here . for this limit",
    "we assume that the relaxation of the solvent takes only a very short time compared to the system times of interest .",
    "the effect of the solvent is twofold . on one hand the system dynamics is perturbed by the solvent state fluctuations , independent of the system states .",
    "@xmath29 shall only reflect the dynamical influence of the fluctuations leading to dissipative processes as discussed in the next subsection . on the other hand",
    "the system states are shifted in energy @xcite , @xmath30 due to the static influence of the solvent which is determined by the relaxed value of the solvent polarization and in general also includes the non - electrostatic contributions such as van - der - waals attraction , short - range repulsion , and hydrogen bonding @xcite . in eq .",

    "here we consider two models of scaling . in the first model",
    "each molecular block is in an individual cavity in the dielectric . for this case",
    "the electrostatic energy reads @xmath41 @xmath42 takes the electron interaction into account while bringing an additional charge onto the block @xmath43 and thus describes the energy to create an isolated ion .",

    "while the bridge energy approaches the donor energy the sequential transfer starts to contribute to the et process .",
    "the traditional scheme of sequential transfer is obtained when donor , bridge , and acceptor levels are arranged in a cascade . in this region",
    "the analytical solution need not coincide with the numerical solution because the used approximations are no more valid .",
    "for equal bridge and acceptor energies @xmath153 displays a small resonance peak in fig .",
    "when the bridge energy is lower than the acceptor energy the population gets trapped at the bridge .",
    "the finite @xmath153 for @xmath188 does not mean et because @xmath189 .",
    "for the dynamic time interval @xmath190 a part of the population tunnels force and back to the acceptor with @xmath153 .",
    "the analytical solution  ( [ rate ] ) gives a constant rate for the regime @xmath191 , while the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ tosolve1])-([tosolve2 ] ) is instable , because such coherent oscillations of population can not be described by eq .",
    "( [ single - exponent ] ) and @xmath153 can not be fitted with eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) . in fig .",
    "4 the regime @xmath191 occurs for small @xmath192 while @xmath193 is kept constant and for large @xmath193 while @xmath192 remains constant .",
    "the energy dependence of the final population has a transparent physical meaning for the whole range of energy .",
    "a large bridge energy ensures the transition of the whole population to the acceptor . in the intermediate case , when the bridge has the same energy as the acceptor , final population spreads itself over these two states @xmath194 . lowering the bridge",
    "even more the whole population remains on the bridge as the lowest state of the system .",
    "the dependence of the et rate on the acceptor energy @xmath195 in fig .",
    "4 remains constant while the acceptor energy lies below the bridge energy .",
    "increase of @xmath193 up to @xmath196 gives the maximal @xmath197 .",
    "when @xmath193 increases further the acceptor becomes the highest level in the system and therefore the population can not remain on it .      for the application of the results to various solvents and comparison with experiment one should use the scaling for energy , coherent couplings , and damping constants as discussed above .",
    "the combinations of the energy scaling in subsection [ chem - isolate ] and damping constants scalings in subsection  [ chem - scaling ] are represented in fig .",
    "an increase in @xmath40 from @xmath198 to @xmath199 leads to an increase of the et rate , no matter which scaling is used .",
    "further increase of @xmath40 induces saturation for the onsager - mataga scaling and even a small decrease within the applied approximations an increase in the solvent polarizability and , consequently , of its dielectric constant lowers the bridge and acceptor energies and increases the system - bath interaction and , consequently , the relaxation coefficients .",
    "it induces a smooth rise of the et rate for the onsager - mataga scaling . on the other hand large @xmath40 leads to essentially different polarisational states of the environment for the supermolecule states with different dipole moment",
    "this reduces the coherent couplings , see eq .",
    "( [ v_scale ] ) , leading for the born - marcus scaling to a small decrease of @xmath153 for large @xmath40 .",
    "the et rate with this scaling comes closer to the experimental value @xmath200 .",
    "this gives a hint that the model of individual cavities for each molecular block is closer to reality than the model with a single cavity for the whole supermolecule .",
    "below we consider born scaling eq .",
    "( [ born - scaling ] ) for the system energies and marcus scaling eq .",
    "( [ marcus - scaling ] ) for the damping constant to compare the calculated et rates with the measured ones .",
    "for the solvents cyclo , mthf , and @xmath156 one obtains the relative bridge energies @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "the calculated et rate coincides with the experimental value @xcite for @xmath0 in cyclo , see table  [ tab:2 ] . for @xmath156",
    "the numerical et rate is approximately 30% faster than the experimental value .",
    "it has to be noted that a value for the damping rates can be chosen such that the calculated curve almost passes through all three experimental error bars .",
    "on the other hand an error in the present calculation could be due to ( i ) absence of vibrational substructure of the electronic states in the present model ; ( ii ) incorrect dependence of system states energies on the solvent properties ; ( iii ) opening of additional transfer channels not mentioned in the scheme shown in fig .",
    "each of these possibilities needs some comments .    _",
    "( i ) : the incorporation of the vibrational substructure will result in a complication of the model @xcite giving a more complicated et rate dependence on the energy of the electronic states and dielectric constant .",
    "it should yield the maximal et rate for nonequal energies of electronic states , namely for the activationless case when the energy difference equals the reorganization energy . for a comparison of the models with and without vibrational substructure",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "_ ad _ ( ii ) : effects as the solvation shell @xcite do need a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the total influence of the solvent is , probably , reflected in an energy shift between the spectroscopically observable states @xmath204 and @xmath205 @xcite .    _ ad _ ( iii ) : a solvent with large @xmath40 can bring high - lying system states closer to the ones included in fig .  1 .",
    "e.g. ,  because of its larger dipole moment , @xmath206 is strongly influenced by the solvent .      as discussed above the rdmem",
    "are very similar to those of the gsle model .",
    "this is an extension of the hsr theory in which a classical bath is used and for which analytical solutions are available @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any analytical solution of the gsle model as presented here .",
    "also this model has not been applied to similar et processes .",
    "the numerical steady - state method used by davis et al .",
    "@xcite is an attractive one due to its simplicity , but unlike our method it is not able to give information about the time evolution of the system .",
    "we use a similar approach derived within a redfield - like theory .",
    "but we consider dephasing and depopulation between each pair of levels .",
    "in contrast davis et al .",
    "incorporate relaxation phenomenologically only to selected levels , dephasing @xmath207 occurs between excited levels , while depopulation @xmath208 takes place only for the sink from acceptor to the ground state . the advantage of the approach of davis et al .",
    "is the possibility to investigate the et rate dependence for the bridge consisting of more than one molecular block .",
    "this was not the goal of the present work but it can be extended into this direction .",
    "we are interested in the et in a concrete molecular complex with realistic parameter values and realistic possibilities to modify those parameter .",
    "our results as well as the results of davis show that et can occur as coherent ( with the superexchange mechanism ) or dissipative process ( with the sequential transfer mechanism ) .",
    "we have performed a study of the et in the supermolecular complex @xmath209 within the dm formalism .",
    "the determined analytical and numerical et rates are in reasonable correspondence with the experimental data .",
    "the superexchange mechanism of et dominates over the sequential transfer .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the model varying one parameter at a time .",
    "the qualitative character of the transfer is stable with respect to a local change of system parameter .",
    "the crossover between the two transfer mechanisms can be induced by lowering the bridge energy .",
    "the relation of the theory presented here to other theoretical approaches to et has been discussed .",
    "the calculations performed in the framework of the present formalism can be extended in the following directions : ( i ) considerations beyond the kinetic limit .",
    "the vibrational substructure has to be included into the model as well as solvent dynamics and , probably , non - markovian rdmem .",
    "( ii ) enlargement of the number of molecular blocks in the complex .",
    "( iii ) initial excitation of states with rather high energy should open additional transfer channels .",
