    "existence of a mass gap for a yang - mills theories received a confirmation from recent lattice studies .",
    "strong evidence has been obtained both in the spectrum @xcite and for the gluon propagator @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "theoretical analysis have confirmed this finding @xcite but none of them reached the status of a rigorous proof .",
    "anyhow , this fundamental result can be used to perform computations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies .",
    "the reason is that a very good approximation for the gluon propagator in the landau gauge in the deep infrared is a free massive propagator as shown in the aforementioned references .    in order to get the gluon propagator in a closed form we need to know what the ground state of a yang - mills theory is .",
    "we select a ground state using known exact solutions of the classical equations of motion of the theory @xcite .",
    "these solutions have the property to recover an instanton liquid for the ground state @xcite in agreement with the results given in @xcite .",
    "we will support our choice by comparing the gluon propagator we obtain with the lattice data at large volume presented in @xcite . having",
    "the gluon propagator in closed form for a given gauge opens up the possibility to perform computations at low energies in qcd both at zero and finite temperature .",
    "indeed , we have shown in this way that a nonlocal nambu - jona - lasinio ( nnjl ) model describes the low energy phenomenology of hadron physics @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we obtained the critical temperature at zero chemical potential for the chiral transition .",
    "this turns out in close agreement with lattice data @xcite and with preceding theoretical computations @xcite . for our aims in this paper",
    "we always reduce the nnjl model to a local one .",
    "improvements are left for future works but are not needed here .",
    "the question of how to correct the njl model is not new @xcite .",
    "these authors do an extensive study of the njl model with both an eight quark interaction term and a t  hooft correction and for zero and non - zero temperature as well .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field is also accounted for .",
    "these corrections are not generally motivated in a situation where the role of the njl model is just in the framework of a postulated phenomenological model , even if with great success .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a sound motivation to the existence of such higher order terms in the njl model deriving them directly from qcd .",
    "this is made possible by the gluon propagator yielded in a closed analytical form and by the existence of a mass gap as said above .",
    "this means that the njl model has a role as a low energy limit of qcd and obtaining higher order corrections is needed due exactly to this role . as a first application",
    "we prove that the eight quark interaction term does not change the critical temperature for the chiral transition .",
    "we will assume the chiral approximation from the start with the u and d quarks having zero mass .",
    "the analysis will be limited to a two - quark model . in this way , this will appear as a leading order approximation to more realistic computations .",
    "it is essential to point out that because we start from qcd , all the parameters of the njl model and its higher order corrections are properly fixed .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce a yukawa model with self - interaction and prove how the infrared limit reduces to a njl model with an eight quark correction term . in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] we show that the classical solutions we consider are indeed a minimum for the action . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we do the same starting from a two - quark qcd theory in the chiral limit . in sec .",

    "[ sec5 ] we prove that , for this model , the eight quark interaction term does not change the critical temperature of the chiral transition .",

    "it is enough to assume a lower bound on the spectrum for @xmath40 that grants the positivity of the energy .",
    "the zero mode is expected due to the translational invariance of the theory .",
    "we can use this strategy to show that the classical solutions we use in our analysis are indeed stable solutions .",

    "this holds on - shell and shows that the argument that works for the free field case holds also here and our classical solutions are a minimum for the action functional , provided we work on - shell .",
    "we see again the zero mode showing that translational invariance applies for the theory .",
    "this applies directly to yang - mills theory as we have shown a mapping theorem between the solutions of the scalar field theory and those of yang - mills theory@xcite .",
    "this theorem grants that , just in the landau gauge , the mapping is exact .",
    "differently from the yukawa model , instead than a scalar field we have to cope with a yang - mills field .",

    "the infrared behavior of the yang - mills field resembles very near the behavior of the quartic scalar field . indeed",
    ", classical solutions can be mapped between these two theories @xcite . from lattice computations",
    "@xcite , we know that , in the landau gauge , the ghost field decouples and behaves as free , the gluon propagator in the deep infrared maps very well a free massive propagator and the running coupling seems to go to zero @xcite marking possibly a trivial theory in this limit .",

    "studies on a yang - mills theory without quarks in the landau gauge , both on the lattice and theoretically , yield strong support to this conclusion . in some way",
    ", physicists have obtained a proof of existence of the mass gap in qcd but this can not be turned yet into a mathematical proof . surely , it is enough to start to perform computations in qcd and try to obtain in this way analytically calculable observables in the low - energy limit . in this paper",
    "we showed that , in the chiral limit with two quarks , the critical temperature of the chiral transition is not influenced by the eight quark interaction term .",
    "this appears in this way a leading order approximation to a complete calculation .",
    "we hope to present in the near future an extended thermodynamical analysis of the njl model we obtained and a study of the particle spectrum as well .",
    "this should grant a better understanding of the low - energy behavior of qcd .",
