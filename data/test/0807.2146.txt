    "the path integral method within the lagrange formalism is a fundamental tool to formulate quantum field theory .",
    "certainly , the treatment of the same theory within the canonical operator formalism is somewhat more cumbersome .",
    "in fact , additionally to the operator - ordering problems of gauge theories @xcite , the formal invariance properties of a generic theory admit additional transformation laws which are not present in the lagrange formulation .",
    "the `` momentum fields '' in such a case are not related to the fundamental fields by means of the canonical equations , see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite , but constitute separate degrees of freedom with independent transformation properties and thus symmetries . as a consequence",
    "the number of variables in the path integral increases in comparison to the lagrange formalism .",
    "this introduces for most theories considerable additional complications in perturbative as well as non - perturbative calculations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "some recent studies indicate that the first order formalism proves to be a successful tool to study the required complete cancellation of the energy divergences @xcite that emerge in a perturbative treatment of coulomb gauge yang - mills theory within the standard lagrange formalism @xcite .",
    "coulomb gauge yang - mills theory has attracted attention since one possible solution to the confinement problem in qcd is provided by the `` gribov - zwanziger '' scenario @xcite ( _ cf .",
    "_ also ref.@xcite ) . however , the problem of renormalizing coulomb gauge yang - mills theory is still unsolved since these energy divergences can not be regularized using any of the standard procedures .",
    "recently it was illustrated how these energy divergences cancel at each order in perturbation theory @xcite . in order to perform explicit calculations a number of methods",
    "have been applied as _",
    "e.g. _ introducing a novel method to regularize feynman integrals in non - covariant gauges @xcite , employing algebraic renormalizability @xcite , and trying to recover coulomb gauge yang - mills theory as a limit of an interpolating gauge @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are several indications that the canonical or first order formalism is better suited for studying coulomb gauge yang - mills theory @xcite . yet",
    ", even if such an approach would be successful , due to the dramatically complicated form of the functional equations in the first order formalism , an explicit non - perturbative study is far too involved to be computationally feasible .",
    "therefore , an analysis in the second order formalism would be highly desirable .",
    "to this end we provide general connections between the greens functions in the two formulations that should help to perform the renormalization in the lagrange framework according to the insight in the renormalization procedure obtained in the hamilton framework .    in order to establish general relations between dressed correlation functions in the different formulations we exploit the following properties . at vanishing sources associated to the momentum fields the effective action ( _ i.e. _ the generating functional of one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions ) of the hamilton formalism reduces to the one of the lagrangean approach .",
    "this allows to reduce the set of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite in the first order formalism to the corresponding set derived from the standard path integral representation .",
    "an important special case is given if the hamiltonian is quadratic in the momentum fields .",
    "for a corresponding generating functional the integration over the momentum fields can be performed and any @xmath1point function involving this field as the average of a polylocal function of the quantum canonical momentum fields can be determined .",
    "this means that the full correlation functions involving these canonical variables can be found as a functional of those that usually appear in the standard path integral representation .",
    "the procedure to find these connections is closely related to the functional method used in the derivation of the dses ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we give the explicit form of these relations for a general four - dimensional renormalizable theory .",
    "this includes the case that the interaction terms involve the time derivative of the fields . in a final step",
    "we resolve the relations between the proper two - point functions in both frames by considering the inverse of the matrix - valued propagators in the hamiltonian approach .",
    "moreover , we show that similar connections arise for theories where not the kinetic but the interaction part is linearized .",
    "such a bosonization procedure is an important technique used in many parts of physics ranging from hadronic physics to condensed matter systems .",
    "our results explicitly verify , in agreement with other approaches , that there is no double counting in bosonized theories , but instead a given correlation function in the underlying theory is exactly given by the sum of all possible contributions involving both the fundamental and the composite degrees of freedom in the bosonized theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii the functional equations for dses and a symmetry - related identity ( like ward - green - takahashi , resp .",
    "slavnov - taylor , identities ( stis ) of a gauge theory @xcite ) in the phase space formulation are given . in sect .",
    "iii we present the first order dses of theories which are quadratic in the momentum fields . in addition , we derive a method to determine the correlation functions and the stis including momentum fields from the respective quantities that usually appear in the standard lagrange representation .",

    "iv , while in sect .  v and sect .",
    "vi we detail the explicit decomposition of the connected and proper two - point functions in the hamilton framework , respectively . in sect .",
    "vii we show that the formalism can also be utilized in the case composite of auxiliary fields , and last but not least in sect .",
    "viii we apply the formalism to the case of coulomb gauge yang - mills theory . in the last section we conclude while essential steps of many calculations have been deferred to several appendices .",
    "we start our analysis by considering a generic quantum field theory formulated within the first order formalism . the hamiltonian density @xmath2 depends on the fundamental fields @xmath3 and the conjugate momentum fields @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "as will be discussed in sect .",
    "iv.d , for fermionic fields the relation between the two formalisms is trivial .",
    "therefore we will treat only the case of bosonic fields in this and the next section .    in the case of gauge invariant theories",
    "we will suppose that the hamiltonian @xmath5 includes the additional terms that arise when the constraints associated to such theories , like _",
    "e.g. _ gauss law in quantum electrodynamics , are localized . in this context each lagrange multiplier necessary to impose the constraints",
    "will be treated as a fundamental field .",
    "certainly the presence of these terms leads to the main differences between gauge theories and the more conventional hamiltonian systems .",
    "in addition , in a fixed gauge , ghost fields appear .",
    "the usual path integral representation of these grassmannian variables is formulated within the first order formalism ( see also sect .",
    "iv.c ) . thus , in the case of a gauge theory they will be analysed in an independent way ( for details see sect .",
    "[ sec : coulomb ] ) . in this section , to set up the problem , we will disregard for the moment these potential complications .",
