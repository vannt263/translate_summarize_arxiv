    "intermediate energy heavy ion collisions ( hics ) are closely connected to the investigation of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "one of the main issues is to pin down the incompressibility ( @xmath4 ) of nuclear matter .",
    "although many efforts have been pursued in the past few decades this problem is still far from being solved thoroughly ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry energy @xcite for isospin - asymmetric matter , the momentum dependence @xcite of the eos , have also been found to be very important for the dynamics of the intermediate energy hics and make the problem of probing the eos even more complex .    in order to explore explicitly the incompressibility ,",
    "the isospin dependence and the momentum dependence of the eos , sensitive probes were put forward , however , mostly individually .",
    "nevertheless , sensitive probes are not always proprietary , that is , they might be affected not only by single physical quantity .",
    "therefore , it is quite necessary to explore multiple probes simultaneously so that the comparison between the experimental data and the corresponding theoretical predictions becomes more consistent .",
    "in addition to free nucleons and light fragments , probes related to pions such as the @xmath5 ratio and the directed and elliptic flows , have been proven to be very useful to test the reaction dynamics as well as the eos @xcite .",
    "it was supposed and observed in refs .",
    "@xcite that pions show a weak positive flow effect in central collisions while a weak antiflow effect in peripheral collisions due to the shadowing effect of spectators .",
    "it should be mentioned that experimental measurements on the pion production with various collision systems and beam energies have been released by the fopi / gsi collaboration in recent years , for example , see refs .",
    "@xcite , which indeed largely deepen our insight into the production mechanism of pions in intermediate energy hics , as well as the dynamics of the nuclear reaction itself .    in this work",
    "we will study a variety of observables related to pion production in isospin - symmetric and -asymmetric systems from central and semi - peripheral intermediate - energy hics .",
    "the microscopic transport model - ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) @xcite - is adopted with an update of the potentials in the mean field part .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the urqmd model and the improvements of the potentials in the mean field part . in section iii ,",
    "the results of the ratios between the yields of charged pions , the various directed and elliptic flows of pion mesons are shown and discussed .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section iv .",
    "in the urqmd transport model @xcite , the initialization of projectile and target nuclei , the equation of motion of hadrons , and the collision term are described microscopically .",
    "this model was designed at the beginning for simulating hics in the energy range from sis to rhic , where the contribution of nuclear mean field potentials to the dynamics of the reaction is considered to be weak .",
    "it is known that the conventional ( or isospin - dependent ) quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite is mainly applied to the ( isospin - asymmetric ) intermediate - energy hics .",
    "the urqmd model inherits the basic treatment of the baryonic equation of motion in the qmd model , thus , after introducing some modern ingredients for the mean field part , it is believed that the urqmd model can also be used to properly describe the physical phenomena in hics at intermediate energies .",
    "furthermore , it has been seen that the contribution of the mean field to the reaction dynamics can not simply be neglected at sis and even ags energies @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the experimental elliptic flow as a function of beam energy ranging from @xmath6 gev for midrapidity protons in au+au collisions can be only successfully described if mean field potentials are taken into account , while pure cascade calculations fail . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the potential that @xmath7 hyperons encounter in the nuclear medium plays an important role in their evolution process in hics at sis energies .",
    "thus , we have updated the potential interactions in the urqmd model for the intended studies .",
    "in addition to the isospin- and momentum- independent terms originally implemented in the mean field part of the urqmd model , the following contributions are also considered here :    \\1 . the contribution of the coulomb interaction between _ mesons _ and hadrons ( mesonic coulomb potential )",
    "are supplied in addition to the coulomb interaction between two baryons ( baryonic coulomb potential ) , in total , we call it hadronic coulomb potential .",
    "it has been found that the coulomb interaction between baryons and charged @xmath8 mesons plays an essential role in the dependence of the @xmath0 ratios on rapidity and transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "\\2 . like in our previous work @xcite , the symmetry potentials of all baryons , i.e. , the nucleons , the @xmath9s , the @xmath10s , and the hyperons @xmath11 and @xmath7 , are introduced .",

    "besides the two- and three - body skyrme potential ( @xmath36 ) , similar to the iqmd model @xcite , we consider a variant nuclear incompressibility , namely , a hard eos with @xmath37 mev ( `` h - eos '' ) , a soft eos with @xmath38 mev ( `` s - eos '' ) , a hard eos ( @xmath39 mev ) with momentum dependence ( `` hm - eos '' ) , and a soft eos ( @xmath38 mev ) with momentum dependence ( `` sm - eos '' ) . the parameters of the various eos used in the urqmd model are listed in table [ tab1 ] . in order to reproduce the ground - state properties of finite nuclei in the urqmd model ( for instance , the binding energy @xmath40 and the r.m.s radius ) ,",

    "this means that the coulomb interaction is the leading cause of the @xmath0 ratio deviating from unity , which is shown in case ( 2 ) .",

    "<S> the influence of the isospin - independent , isospin- and momentum - dependent equation of state ( eos ) , as well as the coulomb interaction on the pion production in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions ( hics ) is studied for both isospin - symmetric and neutron - rich systems . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction plays an important role in the reaction dynamics , and strongly influences the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charged pions . </S>",
    "<S> it even leads to the @xmath0 ratio deviating slightly from unity for isospin-_symmetric _ systems . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction between mesons and baryons is also crucial for reproducing the proper pion flow since it changes the behavior of the directed and the elliptic flow components of pions visibly .    </S>",
    "<S> the eos can be better investigated in neutron - rich system if _ </S>",
    "<S> multiple _ probes are measured simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the rapidity and the transverse momentum distributions of the charged pions , the @xmath0 ratio , the various pion flow components , as well as the _ difference _ of @xmath1-@xmath2 flows . a new sensitive observable </S>",
    "<S> is proposed to probe the symmetry potential energy at high densities , namely the transverse momentum distribution of the elliptic flow difference [ @xmath3 . </S>"
