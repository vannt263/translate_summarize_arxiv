    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs , for a recent review see @xcite ) are a small group ( 47 ) of peculiar high - energy sources generally interpreted as `` magnetars '' , i.e. strongly magnetised ( @xmath110@xmath2 g ) , slowly rotating ( @xmath3 5 - 8 s ) neutron stars powered by the decay of the magnetic field energy , rather than by rotation @xcite .",
    "they were discovered through the detection of recurrent short ( @xmath40.1 s ) bursts of high - energy radiation in the tens to @xmath4hundred kev energy range , with peak luminosity up to 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , above the eddington limit for neutron stars .",
    "the rate of burst emission in sgrs is highly variable .",
    "bursts are generally emitted during sporadic periods of activity , lasting days to months , followed by long `` quiescent '' time intervals ( up to years or decades ) during which no bursts are emitted . occasionally sgrs emit `` giant flares '' , that last up to a few hundred seconds and have peak luminosity up to 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "only three giant flares have been observed to date , each one from a different source ( see , e.g. , @xcite for 052666 , @xcite for 1900 + 14 , @xcite for 180620 ) .",
    "persistent ( i.e. non - bursting ) emission is also observed from sgrs in the soft x  ray range ( @xmath1010 kev ) , with a typical luminosity of @xmath410@xmath11 erg s@xmath7 , and , in three cases , periodic pulsations with periods of 5  8 seconds have been detected .",
    "such pulsations proved the neutron star nature of sgrs and allowed the derivation of spin - down at rates of @xmath410@xmath12 s s@xmath7 , consistent with dipole radiation losses for magnetic fields of the order of b@xmath410@xmath13 - 10@xmath2 g. the x  ray spectra are generally described with absorbed power laws , but in some cases strong evidence has been found for the presence of an additional blackbody - like component with a typical temperature of @xmath40.5 kev @xcite .    over the last few years",
    "the   satellite @xcite , launched in 2002 and operating in the 15 kev-10 mev energy range , has provided a wealth of new results concerning the two brightest sgrs , 180620 and 1900 + 14 .",
    "most aspects concerning the sgrs , short bursts , giant flares , and persistent emission , have been investigated , and new results have been found for each of them . we will review them here .    [ [ sec : zerosei ] ]     was discovered by the interplanetary network ( ipn ) in 1979 @xcite .",
    "it lies in a crowded region close to the galactic centre .",
    "@xcite discovered a quiescent x - ray pulsating ( @xmath14=7.48 s ) counterpart , which was spinning down rapidly ( @xmath15=2.8@xmath1610@xmath17 s s@xmath7 ) . if this spindown is interpreted as braking by a magnetic dipole field , its strength is @xmath110@xmath2 g. the source activity is variable , alternating between quiet periods and very active ones .",
    "after a period of quiescence ,   became active in the summer of 2003 @xcite .",
    "its activity then increased in 2004 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a strong outburst during which about one hundred short bursts were emitted in a few minutes occurred on october 5 2004 @xcite .",
    "finally a giant flare , whose energy ( a few 10@xmath8 erg ) was two orders of magnitude larger than those of the previously recorded flares from sgr 0526 - 66 and sgr 1900 + 14 , was emitted on december 27@xmath18 2004 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented in this section are based on observations obtained with the ibis coded mask telescope @xcite , and in particular with its low - energy ( 15 kev-1 mev ) detector isgri @xcite .",
    "more than 400 short bursts have been detected with ibis / isgri .",
    "they have been identified either using the triggers provided by the   burst alert system ( ibas , @xcite ) , or by computing light curves with 10 ms time resolution and looking for significant excesses corresponding to the direction of .    [",
    "[ spectral - evolution ] ] spectral evolution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    all the bursts detected by ibis are typical in terms of duration and spectra .",
    "the new result provided by the analysis of the   sample is the spectral evolution within the bursts . by computing time",
    "resolved hardness ratios , @xcite showed that some bursts evolve significantly with time , especially the ones with a fast rise exponential decay ( fred ) profile .",
    "the hardness ratios have been computed using the background subtracted light curves in two energy bands ( 20 - 40 ( @xmath19 ) and 40 - 100 ( @xmath20 ) kev ) and were defined as @xmath21=(@xmath20@xmath19)/(@xmath20+@xmath19 ) .",
    "it turns out that the bursts peaks tend to be spectrally softer than the bursts tails .",
    "this behaviour had been reported earlier only for two peculiar bursts originating from .",
    "these two bursts were quite different from usual bursts , lasting about 1 s and having a very hard spectrum ( @xmath22 100 kev , @xcite ) .",
    "one example of this kind of evolution detected in regular bursts for   is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "the spectral behaviour described above gives rise to a global hardness - intensity anti - correlation .",
    "in fact , by considering all the individual time bins of all the bursts this anti - correlation within the bursts has been discovered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hi ] ) .    to investigate the statistical robustness of the correlation found ,",
    "the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient of the 217 data points , @xmath23 , has been computed , which is 0.49 .",
    "this corresponds to a chance probability of 4@xmath1610@xmath24 ( 7.4 @xmath25 ) that the distribution is due to uncorrelated data . according to an f - test",
    "the data are significantly ( 8@xmath25 ) better described by a linear fit ( @xmath26 ) than by a constant .",
    "this correlation still lacks of a solid theoretical interpretation since the current magnetar scenario does not provide a clear prediction of the burst spectral evolution with time .    [",
    "[ number - intensity - distribution ] ] number - intensity distribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we derived the fluences of 224 bursts using the vignetting and dead - time corrected light curves .",
    "we applied a conversion factor between counts and physical units derived by the spectral analysis of the brightest bursts and assuming that the averaged burst spectra do not change much between bright and faint bursts ; for details see @xcite .",
    "these fluences have been used to compute the number - intensity distribution ( log n - log s ) of the bursts .",
    "the experimental distribution deviates significantly from a single power - law ( fig .",
    "[ fig : logn ] ) .",
    "this is first of all due to the fact that the source has been observed at different off - axis angles . the faintest bursts are missed when the source is observed at large off - axis angles . in order to correct for this effect we have computed the effective exposure of the source , taking into account the variation of sensitivity at various off - axis angles .",
    "this yields the exposure - corrected cumulative distribution shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : logn ] .",
    "since the numbers at each flux level are not statistically independent , one can not use a simple @xmath27 minimisation approach to fit the cumulative number - intensity distribution .",
    "so we have used the unbinned detections and applied the maximum likelihood method @xcite , assuming a single power - law distribution for the number - flux relation ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we have used only the part of the distribution where completeness was achieved ( i.e. @xmath293@xmath1610@xmath30 erg @xmath31 ) . in this case the expression to be maximised is @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the unbinned fluxes , @xmath34 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the fluxes , and @xmath35 is the total number of bursts .",
    "this method yields @xmath36=0.91@xmath370.09 . if a single power - law model is an adequate representation of data , the distribution of the quantities @xmath38 should be uniform over the range ( 0,1 ) . in our case , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that a power law is an appropriate model , yielding a probability of 98.8% that the data are well described by our model .",
    "we then divided the bursts into two samples comprising 51 and 173 bursts respectively .",
    "the division is based on the periods of different activity of the source : the 51 bursts were detected in 1 year and the 173 in 2.5 months .",
    "the two slopes derived with the maximum likelihood method are @xmath36=0.9@xmath370.2 for the low level activity period and @xmath36=0.88@xmath370.11 for the high level one .",
    "the two slopes are statistically consistent with each other and a k - s test shows that the probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution is 93% .",
    "thus we conclude that the the relative fraction of bright and faint bursts is not influenced by the level of activity of the source .",
    "[ [ the - large - outburst - of - october-5 - 2004 ] ] the large outburst of october 5 2004 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    on october 5 2004 ibas triggered at 13:56:49 ut on a series of bursts originating from .",
    "detailed analysis of this event showed the presence of more than 100 bursts ; the activity ended at 14:08:03 ut .",
    "some bursts were so bright that they saturated the available telemetry share for ibis , generating some data gaps lasting up to 10 - 20 s. the initial part of the outburst is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : biglc ]    the fluence of the entire outburst as measured by isgri is 1.5@xmath1610@xmath39 erg @xmath31 , with a spectrum which is considerably harder than that of the usual short bursts : @xmath40=58@xmath372 kev , using a thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "this fluence value is however heavily affected by the saturation of the brightest bursts and represents only a lower limit to the real fluence . in order to recover the complete fluence of the event we used the data from the anticoincidence shield ( acs ) of the   spectrometer spi @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : biglc ] ( upper panel ) , only the brightest bursts are visible in these data and hence they represent complementary information to the isgri data .",
    "we used the monte carlo package mggpod @xcite and a detailed mass modelling of spi and the whole satellite ( see @xcite and references therein ) to derive the effective area of the acs for the direction of .",
    "we computed the acs light curve with a binsize of 0.5 s and estimated the background by fitting a constant value to all the data of the same pointing excluding the bursts .",
    "we used the background subtracted light curve to compute the fluence of each burst cluster in counts .",
    "the acs data do not provide any spectral information , so we computed the conversion factor to physical units based on the spectral shapes derived from isgri data and on the effective area computed through our simulations .",
    "the resulting fluences above 80 kev are 1.2@xmath1610@xmath39 and 9.4@xmath1610@xmath41 erg @xmath31 for the first and second clusters respectively . converting these fluences to the 15 - 100 kev band one obtains 7.4@xmath1610@xmath39 and 3.2@xmath1610@xmath39 erg @xmath31 respectively . by adding these results to the ones obtained for the isgri total spectrum",
    ", one can derive the total energy output during the whole event , which is 1.2@xmath1610@xmath42 erg @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to 3.25@xmath1610@xmath6 erg for an assumed distance of 15 kpc @xcite .",
    "these results can be explained in the framework of a recent evolution of the magnetar model , where @xcite explains sgr bursts as generated by loss of magnetic equilibrium in the magnetosphere , in close analogy to solar flares : new current - carrying magnetic flux tubes rise continuously into the magnetosphere , driven by the deformations of the neutron star crust .",
    "this in turn generates an increasingly complicated magnetic field structure , which at some point becomes unstable to resistive reconnection . during these reconnection events , some of the magnetic energy carried by the currents associated with the magnetic flux tubes",
    "is dissipated .",
    "the large event described here can be explained by the simultaneous presence of different active regions ( where the flux emergence is especially active ) in the magnetosphere of the neutron star .",
    "in fact , a long outburst with multiple components is explained as the result of numerous avalanche - type reconnection events , as reconnection at one point may trigger reconnection at other points .",
    "this explains the fact that the outburst seems to be composed by the sum of several short bursts .",
    "this kind of event may be correlated with a particularly complicated magnetic field structure . a large part of the energy stored in the manetosphere",
    "has then been released during the giant flare on december 27 , when a global restructuring may have taken place .",
    "this mode also suggests that short events are due to reconnection , while longer events have in addition a large contribution from the surface , heated by the precipitating particles , and are harder .",
    "this may explain the generally harder spectra observed .",
    "however more  classical \" scenarios involving only crust fracturing with a large - scale shear deformation of the crust involving the collective motion of many small units , without an internal contribution , can not be ruled out , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the october 5@xmath18 event fits the trend of increasing source bursting activity shown by   in 2003 and 2004 . in the same time span",
    "also the luminosity and spectral hardness of the persistent emission at high ( 20 - 150 kev , see below ) and low ( 2 - 10 kev , @xcite ) energies increased . on the other hand , this peculiar event did not mark a peak or a turnover in the sgr activity .",
    "in fact the two xmm observations of   performed just before ( september 6 2004 ) and the day after this large outburst ( as a too in response to it ) yielded similar spectral parameters , fluxes and pulse profiles , and bursts were seen in both observations @xcite .",
    "thus events like these release a small ( compared to giant flares ) fraction of the energy stored in the twisted magnetic field of the neutron star , not allowing the magnetic field to decay significantly .",
    "they are rather related to phases of high activity due to large crustal deformations ( indicating that a large quantity of energy is still stored in magnetic form ) and can be looked at as precursors of a major reconfiguration of the magnetic field .",
    "a giant flare from   was discovered with the   gamma - ray observatory on 2004 december 27 @xcite , and detected with many other satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) the analysis of the spi - acs data ( @xmath080 kev ) of the flare , presented in @xcite , show that the giant flare is composed by an initial spike lasting 0.2 s followed by a @xmath4400 s long pulsating tail , modulated at the neutron star period of 7.56 s. the initial spike was so bright that it saturated the acs , so we could derive only a lower limit on its fluence , which turned out to be two orders of magnitude brighter ( 10@xmath8 ergs , see e.g. @xcite ) than the previously observed giant flares from   @xcite , and sgr 052666 @xcite .",
    "the energy contained in the tail ( 1.6@xmath1610@xmath43 ergs ) , on the other hand , was of the same order as the one in the pulsating tails of the previously observed giant flares .",
    "a @xmath40.2 s long small burst was detected in the acs data 2.8 s after the initial spike .",
    "it is superposed on the pulsating tail and has no clear association with the pulse phase .",
    "this burst has been interpreted by @xcite as the reflection by the moon of the initial spike of the giant flare .",
    "in fact this delay corresponds to the light travel time between , the moon , and back .",
    "a similar detection was reported with the helicon - coronas - f satellite @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature provided by the   data is the detection of a possbile early high - energy afterglow emission associated with the giant flare . at the end of the pulsating tail",
    "the count rate increased again , forming a long bump which peaked around t@xmath4700 s and returned to the pre - flare background level at t@xmath43000 - 4000 .",
    "this component decays as @xmath44 , and is shown in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare ] , while the overall long term background trend is shown in yellow , and the giant flare itself in red .",
    "the association of this emission with   is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the fluence contained in the 400 - 4000 s time interval is approximately the same as that in the pulsating tail . with simple gamma - ray burst afterglow models based on synchrotron emission",
    "one can derive the bulk lorentz factor @xmath45 from the time @xmath46 of the afterglow onset : @xmath4715(@xmath48/5@xmath16 10@xmath49 ergs)@xmath50(@xmath51/0.1 @xmath52)@xmath53(@xmath46/100)@xmath54 , where @xmath51 is the ambient density .",
    "this is consistent with the mildly relativistic outflow inferred from the radio data @xcite .          in 2005",
    "two groups reported independently the discovery of persistent hard x - ray emission originating from   @xcite . up to then , spectral information on the perisistent emission of sgrs was known only below 10 kev .",
    "the low energy spectrum is usually well described by the sum of a power law component and a black body .",
    "the spectrum above 20 kev is rather hard with a photon index between 1.5 and 2.0 and extends up to 150 kev without an apparent cutoff .",
    "it connects rather well with the low energy ( @xmath10 10 kev ) spectrum @xcite , and the intensity and spectral hardness are correlated with the degree of bursting activity of the source @xcite and with the ir flux @xcite .",
    "our group is continuosly monitoring the hard x - ray flux of , and the long term light curve of the source is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerosei ] . as can be seen , the persistent flux increased in 2003 and 2004 up to the giant flare ( which is marked with a vertical line in the plot ) , and then decreased in 2005 .",
    "this behaviour can be interpreted as an increase of the twist angle in the magnetar magnetic field , which in turn increases the burst emission rate , and produces harder spectra , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]     was discovered in 1979 by @xcite when it emitted 3 bursts in 2 days .",
    "since then short bursts were observed from this source with batse , rxte and interplanetary network satellites in the years 1979 - 2002 .   emitted a giant flare on august 27 1998 ( e.g. @xcite ) , followed by less intense `` intermediate '' flares on august 29 1998 @xcite and in april 2001 @xcite .",
    "the last bursts reported from   were observed with the third interplanetay network ( ipn ) in november 2002 @xcite .",
    "no bursts from this source were revealed in all the   observations from 2003 to 2005 , but swift has detected renewed activity in 2006 @xcite .      using 2.5 ms of   data , @xcite reported the discovery of persistent hard x - ray emission , this time from a quiescent sgr , 1900 + 14 .",
    "this emission extended up to @xmath4 100 kev , but with a softer spectrum compared to , having a photon index of 3.1@xmath370.5 . also the luminosity is dimmer in this case , being @xmath44@xmath1610@xmath11 erg s@xmath7 , a factor of three lower than . the   observations spanned march 2003 to june 2004 , and did not include the recent reactivation of the source in march 2006 @xcite , when the source emitted a few tens of regular bursts plus an intense burst series , lasting @xmath430 s @xcite , reminiscent of the october 5 2004 event from .",
    "we recently analysed the   data spanning from august 2004 to march 2006 , and found that the hard x - ray flux of the source flux did not increase up to a few weeks before its reactivation .",
    "this indicates that the reactivation was not triggered by a flux increase , at least on the time scale of a few months sampled by .",
    "the soft and constant spectrum of  is possibly related to the fact that this source is still in a rather quiescent state .",
    "hard x - ray persistent emission ( @xmath020 kev ) has recently been detected from another group of sources , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps , @xcite ) , which share several characteristics with the sgrs and are also believed to be magnetars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission has been detected from three axps with : 1e 1841045 @xcite , 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite and 1rxs j170849400910 @xcite .",
    "the presence of pulsations seen with rxte up to @xmath4200 kev in 1e 1841045 @xcite proves that the hard x - ray emission originates from the axp and not from the associated supernova remnant kes 73 .",
    "the discovery of ( pulsed ) persistent hard x - ray tails in these three sources was quite unexpected , since below 10 kev the axp have soft spectra , consisting of a blackbody - like component ( kt@xmath40.5 kev ) and a steep power law ( photon index @xmath434 ) .    in order to coherently compare the broad band spectral properties of all the sgrs and axps detected at high energy , we analysed all the public   data using the same procedures .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbsp ] , where the   spectra are plotted together with the results of observations at lower energy taken from the literature ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "as can be seen , axps generally present harder spectra than sgrs in hard x - rays . in particular , for the three axps , a spectral break is expected to occur between 10 and 20 kev in order to reconcile the soft and the hard parts of the spectrum . on the other hand sgrs ,",
    "present a softer spectrum at higher energies also implying a break around 15 kev ( especially for ) but in the opposite sense with respect to the axps .",
    "the fact that the spectral break is more evident in   could be due to the fact that its level of activity was much lower during our observations , compared to .",
    "all three axps , on the other hand , can be considered to have been in a quiescent state since no bursts were been reported from them during the   observation .",
    "the magnetar model , in its different flavours , explains this hard x - ray emission as powered by bremsstrahlung photons produced either close to the neutron star surface , or at a high altitude ( @xmath4 100 km ) in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the two models can be distinguished by the presence of a cutoff at @xmath4 100 kev or @xmath4 1 mev .",
    "unfortunately current experiments like   are not sensitive enough to firmly assess the presence of the cutoffs and hence to distinguish between the two models .",
    "thanks to , and in particular to its imager ibis , we have been able to study most of the magnetars phenomenology with unprecedented sensitivity at high energies .",
    "one of the most striking results is the discovery , which was particularly unexpected for axps , of the persistent hard x - ray emission .",
    "this discovery , which can be considered one of the most important   results at all , represents a new important input for theoreticians who started to include it in the magnetar model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the large number of detected short bursts from   allowed us a good determination of the shape and slope of their number - intensity distribution , showing that a single power law holds over 2.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the fact that   has been particularly active in these last years , also emitting a once - in - a - lifetime event such as the giant flare ( and its possible high energy afterglow ) , has allowed observations of relatively rapid changes of the bursting and persistent emission of a magnetar and to interpret then with the evolution of a very strong and complicated magnetic field , confirming the magnetic field as the dominant source of energy in soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",

    "<S> thanks to s long exposures of the galactic plane , the two brightest soft gamma - ray repeaters , sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , have been monitored and studied in detail for the first time at hard - x / soft gamma rays .    </S>",
    "<S> this has produced a wealth of new scientific results , which we will review here . since sgr </S>",
    "<S> 1806 - 20 was particularly active during the last two years , more than 300 short bursts have been observed with   and their characteristics have been studied with unprecedented sensitivity in the 15 - 200 kev range . </S>",
    "<S> a hardness - intensity anticorrelation within the bursts has been discovered and the overall number - intensity distribution of the bursts has been determined . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a particularly active state , during which  100 bursts were emitted in  10 minutes , has been observed on october 5 2004 , indicating that the source activity was rapidly increasing . </S>",
    "<S> this eventually led to the giant flare of december 27th 2004 , for which a possible soft gamma - ray ( @xmath080 kev ) early afterglow has been detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the deep observations allowed us to discover the persistent emission in hard x - rays ( 20 - 150 kev ) from 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 , the latter being in a quiescent state , and to directly compare the spectral characteristics of all magnetars ( two sgrs and three anomalous x - ray pulsars ) detected with . </S>"
