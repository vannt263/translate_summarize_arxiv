    "the hubble constant @xmath0 is an indicator of the global expansion of the universe .",
    "theoretically , this parameter is defined in terms of the cosmological principle , i.e. , the overall matter distribution of the universe is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "the isotropy of the universe has been remarkably demonstrated by the measurement of the @xmath11k microwave background radiation ( e.g. bennett et al .",
    "however , observations have indicated that there exists an inhomogeneous matter distribution in the local universe on scale up to @xmath1 mpc , such as matter clumps , voids , filaments , etc . , which may cause a deviation of the local hubble expansion from the global one .",
    "the pioneering work to directly measure the variation of the hubble constant with distance was carried out by sandage , tammann and hardy in 1972 , using the first ranked e galaxies .",
    "two decades later , lauer & postman ( 1992 ) conducted another direct observation from the brightest cluster galaxies to @xmath12 .",
    "these authors have essentially reached a similar conclusion that the ratio of the local hubble constant @xmath13 to the global one @xmath14 is consistent with unity , indicative of a very minor effect of local matter clumps and voids on the expansion of the universe .",
    "other evidences from the study of the hubble diagram of various objects ( e.g. sandage & hardy 1973 ; tammann & sandage 1995 ) supported that the hubble constant is roughly invariant .",
    "however , this situation has been recently challenged by several determinations of the hubble constant utilizing cepheid variables and the globular cluster luminosity function in some nearby galaxies , which yield a large value of @xmath0 ranging from 69 to 87 km s@xmath15 mpc ( pierce et al . 1994 ; freedman et al .",
    "1994 ; tanvir et al . 1995",
    "; whitmore et al .",
    "these correspond to an age of the universe of @xmath16 gyr in the frame of the standard cosmological model , while the oldest known stars in globular clusters of our galaxy are estimated to be about @xmath17 gyr ( bolte & hogan 1995 ) .",
    "if these calibrations are correct rather than suffer from the systematic and logical errors as were argued by sandage and collaborators ( sandage 1996 ; sandage & tammann 1996 ; reference therein ) , there are two possibilities to remove the apparent conflict over the age of the universe : ( 1 ) a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath18 [ see ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) for a summary ] and ( 2 ) a local low - density region embedded in a globally flat universe ( turner , cen & ostriker 1992 ; wu et al .",
    "the later requires a considerably variation of the hubble constant with distance .",
    "the claim for a deviation of the local hubble flow from the global one is indirectly supported by the following observations : from the time delay of 1.1 years revealed by over 10 years coverage of the monitoring of the gravitationally - doubled images qso0957 + 561a , b at redshift of 1.41 , one has found @xmath19 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 [ see wu ( 1996 ) for a recent review ] .",
    "this global value is relatively low though large uncertainties may exist in the resulting @xmath14 due to the modeling of the deflectors .",
    "for instance , a new lensing model of qso0957 + 561a , b based on the same data yields @xmath20 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ( grogin & narayan 1996 ) .",
    "another evidence comes from the measurement of sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) effect , which is the spectral distortion of the cosmic background radiation due to the inverse compton cooling of the hot x - ray gas in clusters of galaxies ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "it has been found that a relatively small value of the hubble constant is derived from distant galaxy cluster , e.g. @xmath21 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 for a2218 ( @xmath22 ) ( jones et al .",
    "1993 ; birkinshaw & hughes 1994 ) , @xmath23 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 for a665 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 for cl0016 + 16 ( @xmath26 ) ( yamashita 1994 ) .",
    "however , the detection of the s - z effect for nearby coma cluster provides @xmath27 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ( herbig et al .",
    "it seems likely that the hubble constant decreases with redshift .",
    "yet , the errors in these measurements are still large and uncertainties from modeling of the hot x - ray gas in clusters of galaxies need to be further studied ( inagaki , suginohara & suto 1995 ; rephaeli 1995 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is crucial to realize that the hubble constant depends on the matter distribution since the expansion is uniquely governed by the gravitational matter of the universe .",
    "there have been increasing observational evidences that the local matter density @xmath28 within a few 10 mpc is only @xmath29@xmath5 ( bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 ; references therein ) .",
    "however , the standard inflation cosmological model predicts an overall matter density of @xmath30 .",
    "this matter discrepancy implies a gradient of the hubble constant along distance .",
    "the present measurement of the hubble constant as well as the density parameter is still a controversial issue .",
    "it turns out to be unclear whether or not the hubble constant alters with distance . in this paper , we address the following question : if the hubble constant is variant , what effect will it have on the fundamental relations in astronomy ?",
    "in particular we will demonstrate this effect on the magnitude - redshift relation using the distant type ia supernova ( section 2 ) and on the source number counts using the faint galaxy population ( section 3 ) . in section 4 we will construct a simple analytic model for a locally low and globally high density universe instead of the usual simulation method ( e.g. turner et al .",
    "1992 ; suto et al . 1995 ; nakamura & suto 1995 ; shi et al .",
    "a brief discussion and our conclusions will be given in section 5 .",
    "study of the magnitude - redshift relation ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) , i.e. the hubble diagram , at moderate and high redshift has been thought to be able to provide information on the deceleration parameter @xmath10 or @xmath3 . however , to do this one actually needs to presume that @xmath0 is invariant with redshift . in the past decades",
    "many attempts have been made to derive @xmath3 from the @xmath7@xmath8 relation for various objects .",
    "we will illustrate this procedure and discuss the influence of the variation of @xmath3 or @xmath0 on @xmath7@xmath8 relation using the most distant type ia supernova ( sn ia ) discovered recently at @xmath9 ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "because of the narrow distribution of their absolute magnitudes at maximum light , sn ia s are often considered to be `` standard candles '' and therefore , used as distance indicators ( branch & tammann 1992 ; branch , nugent & fisher 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the detection of @xmath31 distant sn ia s at redshift @xmath32 provides an unprecedented method of measuring the geometry of distant universe ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 ; goobar & perlmutter 1995 ; branch et al .",
    "1996 ) . neglecting the @xmath33 correction and the extinction of our galaxy for the moment ,",
    "the @xmath7@xmath8 relation of a sn ia with absolute magnitude @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the luminosity distance :",
    "@xmath37 if the absolute magnitude @xmath38 at maximum light is calibrated using the nearby sn ia s , e.g. for @xmath39 band ( perlmutter et al . 1995 ) , @xmath40 then the monitoring of the apparent magnitude variation of distant sn ia s can give rise to the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath3 . calibrating the @xmath39 light curve of a distant sn ia at @xmath9 by eq.(1 ) and the template standard model for nearby sn ia s , perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reached a result of @xmath41 . at the time of the refereeing process , another @xmath42 distant sn ia s",
    "have been found and a similar inverstigation has been made by the lbl group ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1996 ; kim et al .",
    "1996 ) , which leads to a new determination of @xmath43 .",
    "note that their analysis was based on the hypothesis that the local expansion rate @xmath13 remains as the same as the global hubble flow @xmath14 so that the hubble constant does not appear in their final result .    what would happen if @xmath44 ? in a locally low but globally high density universe ( @xmath45 ) , the observed apparent magnitude of a distant sn ia at maximum light should be generally written as @xmath46 where the first term on the right hand side is the local calibration at maximum light and the second one denotes the deviation of the local expansion from the global hubble flow .",
    "compared with the conventional mattig s relation , eq.(4 ) contains two free parameters : @xmath3 and @xmath47 .",
    "taking the observational data from the first discovered distant sn ia , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 extinction ) and @xmath51 ( difference of @xmath50 and @xmath39 magnitudes ) ( perlmutter et al . 1995 ) , we have plotted the variation of @xmath47 versus @xmath3 in fig.1 , together with the total errors introduced by the intrinsic dispersion of @xmath34 for the sn ia ( @xmath52 ) and other errors ( @xmath53 ) from the photo noise , calibration , etc .",
    "the major error stems from the intrinsic dispersion , which can be greatly reduced with the employment of more distant sn ia s .",
    "based on one distant sn ia at @xmath9 , limit on the variation of the hubble constant is @xmath54 and @xmath55 for a global density of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "because of the large errorbars , the variation of @xmath47 has not been well constrained .",
    "however , this example shows that the @xmath7@xmath8 relation can not be used for the determination of the global @xmath58 unless the variation of the hubble constant is _ a priori _ given .",
    "the deviation of @xmath13 from @xmath14 also affects the calibration of the number - magnitude relation .",
    "compared with the local sources ( e.g. galaxies ) , the luminosity distance @xmath36 and the volume element in the distant universe change by a factor of @xmath47 and @xmath59 , respectively . as a result , the number density of the sources at high redshift would appear to be different from the local one .",
    "we now show this effect by considering the galaxy number counts .",
    "we employ the schechter luminosity function for the galaxy luminosity distribution which has been calibrated locally ( efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) : @xmath60 mpc@xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "we keep the same galaxy morphological composition as those used by yoshii & sato ( 1992 ) : ( e / s0,sab , sbc , scd , sdm)=(0.215,0.185,0.160,0.275,0.165 ) and take the @xmath33 correction from king & ellis ( 1985 ) . because our goal is to demonstrate the influence of @xmath47",
    ", we will not include the evolution correction which is dependent of the cosmological models ( @xmath0 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume a constant comoving number density of galaxies and extrapolate the above conditions up to @xmath65 .",
    "fig.2 shows the differential number counts of galaxies per square degree in @xmath39 band for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , where the global matter density is chosen to be unity .",
    "it turns out that there are no apparent differences in the curves at the bright limiting magnitude .",
    "however , a significant excess of faint population is predicted for @xmath45 .",
    "note that the scale in the @xmath68axis should not be regarded as an accurate indicator of the magnitude due to the ignorance of the color and evolution corrections .",
    "this number disprepancy of faint galaxies arising from the local calibration of the hubble constant may partially explain the excess of number counts of faint blue galaxies in observations ( broadhurst , ellis & glazebrook 1992 ; references therein ) .",
    "meanwhile , this might resolve the too few giant luminous arcs predicted from the statistical lensing by clusters of galaxies , in which background galaxies were assumed to follow their local properties ( wu & hammer 1993 ; wu & mao 1996 ) .",
    "arcs / arclets have been shown to be a very efficient tool for probe of the distant galaxies [ see fort & mellier ( 1994 ) for a recent review ] . alternatively , the magnification probability of distant quasars by foreground galaxies ( turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) is increased by a factor of roughly @xmath69 while the expected separation of images remains unchanged .",
    "while the dynamical measurement shows @xmath29@xmath5 ( bahcall et al . 1995 ) , we are situated in a low - density region if @xmath70 is close to unity as predicted by the standard inflation model .",
    "we now construct a simple model for the local universe .",
    "the tolman - bondi metric is suitable for the description of the space - time of a spherical perturbation in an expanding universe . for an initial underdense perturbation @xmath71 at the cosmic epoch @xmath72 or at redshift @xmath73 , its evolution follows @xmath74 @xmath75^{3/2}}{\\omega_i(1-\\delta_i ) }                   \\left(h_it_i\\right)\\left(\\frac{t}{t_i}-1\\right)+                 \\frac{2\\sqrt{1-\\omega_i(1-\\delta_i)}}{\\omega_i(1-\\delta_i)}-              \\cosh^{-1}\\frac{2-\\omega_i(1-\\delta_i)}{\\omega_i(1-\\delta_i)},\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the mean mass density and the hubble constant at @xmath72 for the background universe , respectively , which are related to their present values through @xmath78 @xmath79 for the sake of simplicity as well as the desire of the inflation model , the background universe is often taken to be flat in the previous similar studies ( e.g. nakamura & suto 1995 ; wu et al .",
    "1995 ) . with the choice of @xmath6 eqs.(5 ) and",
    "( 6 ) reduce to the results of wu et al .",
    "we are now dealing with a global open / flat universe .",
    "the ages of an open universe at @xmath72 and @xmath80 ( present ) are @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . defining the present hubble constant as @xmath83",
    ", we can find the relationship between the local hubble constant @xmath13 and the background one @xmath14 to be @xmath84 finally , the energy conservation gives rise to the present mass density of the local universe @xmath85 developed from the initial fluctuation @xmath71 : @xmath86 ^ 3.\\ ] ]    setting the epoch of the initial perturbation of our local low - density region to be the decoupling of @xmath87 , we have performed the numerical computations of @xmath47 versus @xmath3 for the local mass density of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath5 and illustrated the results in fig.3 .",
    "as is expected , the deviation of the local expansion rate from the global hubble flow depends critically on the mass density difference between the local and background universe . using the local dynamical measurement of @xmath90@xmath5 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ) , we can set the variation of the hubble constant in a global flat universe to be @xmath91 . recall that @xmath92 in the extreme case of where @xmath93 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have shown that if the matter density of our local universe within @xmath1 mpc is @xmath29@xmath5 , as indicated by the dynamical observations ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the global value is close to unity , as predicted by the standard inflation model , then the local hubble expansion rate would be @xmath94 times larger than the global one .",
    "the current measurements of the hubble constant do not exclude this variation with distance . as a consequence ,",
    "we need to be cautious of using some fundamental relations .    utilizinging a distant sn ia at @xmath9 discovered recently ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1995 ) , we have demonstrated how the variation of @xmath47 affects the magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "given the global matter density @xmath70 , we have placed the preliminary limit on @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out that due to the large intrinsic dispersion for the sn ia , the variation of @xmath47 has not been well constrained .",
    "the current limit is consistent with either a uniform expansion or a variation of @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , we have pointed out that there are two free parameters , @xmath70 and @xmath47 , appearing in the @xmath7@xmath8 relation at moderate / high redshift if the local calibration is used , which would invalidate the conventional method of determining @xmath3 from the difference in the mattig relation unless observations are able to provide the relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is consistent with the recent work by kim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the deviation of the local hubble expansion from the global one would have influence on the calibration of the number counts of distant sources .",
    "we have found that the number density of distant faint galaxies would be underestimated if @xmath45 .",
    "this may partially remove the demand for a strong evolution scenario of galaxies population in order to account for the number excess of faint ( blue ) galaxies . as a result , the theoretically predicted number of giant arcs , which are the distorted images of distant galaxies by the gravitational potentials of foreground clusters of galaxies , would increases .",
    "this probably provides another explanation for the deficit of giant arcs in statistical lensing ( wu & mao 1996 ) .",
    "we have only discussed the effect of @xmath47 on the magnitude - redshift relation and the number counts . indeed ,",
    "if the local expansion is larger than the global one , many aspects of astrophysics might need to be modified .",
    "the crucial point depends on the measurements of both the hubble constant and the matter density at different redshift .",
    "the current status on the determinations of @xmath0 and @xmath3 appears to be unfortunate : the observations using the same method can result in very different results .",
    "here we do not intend to be involved in the disputes .",
    "instead , we point out that it would be of great significance if one would explore other possibilities which can be used to probe or constrain the variations of the hubble constant and the density parameter",
