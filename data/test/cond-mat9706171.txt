    "up until 1961 the statistical mechanics of the classical one dimensional coulomb gas was an unsolved problem . at more or less the same time",
    "the problem was solved by lenard @xcite and independently by prager @xcite .",
    "a powerful alternative method of solution using functional integration was subsequently expounded by lenard and edwards @xcite .",
    "a good review of this work may be found in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the two dimensional coulomb gas may also be solved exactly at the temperature where @xmath0 ; this exactly soluble case has been investigated in the electric double layer geometry by cornu and jancovici @xcite .",
    "the problem of electrostatic interactions is one of profound importance in the theory of colloidal stability and also in the understanding of thin liquid films . in these problems",
    "one considers the behavior of an electrolytic fluid between two surfaces which either model the surface of large colloidal particles or the surfaces of the thin liquid film .",
    "the charging mechanism of the surfaces is usually of a statistical mechanical origin .",
    "for example in soap films made from sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) , the soap anions have hydrocarbon tails which are hydrophobic and hence have a preference to lie on the surface of the film @xcite . in colloidal systems",
    "chemical reactions may occur between the colloid particles and the surrounding electrolytic medium again leading to surface charging . as the two planes are brought together",
    "surface charge regulation occurs .",
    "the precise qualitative behavior is still only understood within the context of mean field poisson - boltzmann type theories @xcite , and at a more sophisticated level using the hyper - netted chain approximation ( hnc ) .",
    "rather surprisingly the hnc theory predicts , in the context of colloidal systems , that the electrostatic interactions between the planes may become attractive for small separations @xcite ; this is supported by calculations of the fluctuations about the mean field solutions @xcite . in the mean field model applied to soap films charge regulation is predicted @xcite , but no attractive component is seen to appear within the electrostatic interactions .",
    "interestingly the point at which charge regulation becomes important in the mean field model for sds soap films coincides with the range at which collapse to a newton black film ( nbf ) occurs @xcite .",
    "there is much indirect evidence that the transition from a normal film to a nbf is of first order , for example it is believed to be exothermic and occurs via a nucleation process where regions of black film expand over the surface of the film . in this paper",
    "we propose to analyze the exactly soluble one dimensional version of the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "we shall use the method of @xcite to solve the problem but we shall highlight the finite size effects appearing in the problem to gain an understanding of how charge regulation occurs in the model .",
    "we shall compare our exact results with those of mean field theory to ascertain , at least in one dimension , the accuracy of the traditional poisson - boltzmann mean field approach .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we formulate a form of the soap film model used in @xcite in one dimension .",
    "the problem is solved using the functional integral formalism of @xcite and the limit of bulk systems is rederived for the sake of completeness .",
    "we then analyze the problem in the case of finite films with surface binding interactions and discuss the nature of the charge regulation and the stability criterion for the one dimensional film .",
    "we then compare the mean field poisson - boltzmann theory with the exact results .",
    "finally we conclude with a brief comparison between the qualitative behavior observed in the one dimensional system and that of experiments .",
    "here we shall summarize the approach of @xcite and apply it to the system in which we are interested . the field theory for the system we shall consider",
    "is derived from considering a model consisting of a monovalent soap molecules whose anions are attracted to the surface of the soap film by the presence of an effective potential @xmath1 which acts on them and whose support is localized at the two adjacent surfaces of the film . in addition one may add an additional monovalent electrolytic species . in the grand canonical ensemble",
    "if the fugacities for the soap anions / cations and the electrolyte anions / cations are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , then the partition function is given by @xcite    @xmath4 \\exp\\bigl [ -{1\\over 2}\\int \\lb { d\\psi\\over dx}\\rb^2 dx   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\mu_s \\int \\lb \\exp\\lb - i\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi - \\beta v(x)\\rb + \\exp\\lb i\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi\\rb \\rb dx+ 2\\mu_e\\int \\cos\\lb\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi\\rb dx \\bigr ]   \\label{eq : ft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the derivation of the representation above is quite standard and relies on the introduction of the hubbard stratonovich field @xmath5 . in general dimension",
    "the field theory is a form of the sine - gordon field theory and is not generally soluble . for simplicity we shall chose the form of @xmath1 to be such that ( -v(x ) ) = 1 + ^*(x ) +",
    "^*(x - l ) , [ eq : vx ] i.e. the effective surface potential is highly localized about the boundary points @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the @xmath8 appearing in ( [ eq : vx ] ) is similar to the adhesivity introduced by davies @xcite in his analysis of the surface tensions of hydrocarbon solution although the idea of such a surface active term goes back to boltzmann . for physically realisable soap films @xmath1 is not strictly localized as the effective potential created due to the hydrophobic nature of the soap anion hydrocarbon tails has a support over a region of the length the tail between the surface and the interior of the film ( see @xcite for a discussion of the mechanism generating this potential ) .",
    "however for the purposes of demonstrating the the essential physics of charge regulation in a one dimensional system our choice of @xmath1 should be adequate . with this choice of @xmath9",
    "we obtain @xmath10 \\exp\\bigl[- { 1\\over 2}\\int \\lb { d\\psi\\over dx}\\rb^2 dx \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2\\mu\\int \\cos\\lb\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi\\rb dx   + \\lll\\lb \\exp(-i\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi(0))+ \\exp(-i\\beta^{1\\over2}e\\psi(l))\\rb \\bigr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "because now the potential @xmath9 acts only on the end points we may write @xmath13 in path integral notation as , @xmath14 \\exp\\bigl [ -{1\\over 2}\\int \\lb { d\\psi\\over dx}\\rb^2 dx \\nonumber \\\\   & + & 2\\mu\\int \\cos\\lb\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi\\rb dx   + \\lll\\lb \\exp(-i\\beta^{1\\over 2}e\\psi(0))+ \\exp(-i\\beta^{1\\over2}e\\psi(l))\\rb \\bigr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the path integral is that for a diffusing particle in a cosine potential ( the normalization coming from the determinant is absorbed in the factor @xmath15 ) , consequently following @xcite we find z = 1n d_0 d_l",
    "p_0,_l | l ,    where @xmath16 obeys    + 2 ^ 12ep = p ,    subject to the initial condition @xmath17 .",
    "note here that the boundary terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 in our path integral are free and are integrated over , this is in contrast to the study of @xcite , where @xmath20 and @xmath19 is left free .",
    "this is because in the formulation of @xcite , it is assumed that the overall system bulk plus the film is electroneutral and that the bulk lies to the left of the point @xmath6 . in our case",
    "the bulk may be screened from the film and the most general boundary conditions are those we have employed . in order to determine the normalization factor @xmath15 we note that when @xmath21 then we should obtain the ideal gas result @xmath22 . in this case",
    "p(_0,| x ) = 1 - 12x(-_0)^2 ( 2x ) giving simply    z|_e = = 0 = 1nd_0 ( 2l ) .    at this point",
    "we must regularize the partition function by bounding the possible values of @xmath18 between two extrema yielding    n = 1 .    in the case",
    "where @xmath23 we may use the fact that the action is invariant under translations of @xmath24 to obtain ( we have simply assumed that the extremal values of @xmath18 are integer multiples of @xmath24 )    z = e^122 _ 0 ^2/^12 d_0 _ -^",
    "d_l p_0,_l | l.    a further simplification is obtained by noting that    p_0,_l | lf(_l)d_l = k(_0 |l ) , where @xmath25 obeys    h k = k l ,    with    h = 12 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 + 2 ( ^12e_0 ) ,    subject to the initial condition @xmath26 . in our problem f(_0 ) = ( -i^12e_0)[f ]    for simplicity in notation we shall take @xmath27 from here on . to recover the temperature dependence the rescalings @xmath28 and @xmath29 should be performed .",
    "the final expression for @xmath13 is    z = e2_0 ^ 2e d_0 k(_0 |l ) f(_0 ) ,    which in operator notation may be expressed as    z = e2_0 ^ 2e d_0 f(_0 ) ( lh ) f(_0 ) .    the free energy of the film is simply given by @xmath30 . in order to calculate the disjoining pressure",
    "we assume that the film is attached to an infinite reservoir of particles with the same chemical potentials .",
    "in addition the over all volume ( i.e. length ) of the system is conserved .",
    "this last point is quite important in understanding the statistical physics of small systems where thermodynamic ideas can not be necessarily applied directly .",
    "our physical assumption of the over all incompressibility of the system is motivated by the principle that the background space of water can be assumed to be incompressible in most experimental regimes in colloid and thin film science .",
    "therefore on changing the volume of the film by @xmath31 , the free energy of the bulk is changed by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the free energy per unit volume of an infinite system ( i.e. one which is really in the thermodynamic limit ) without any boundary interaction .",
    "the work done on this change is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the disjoining pressure .",
    "therefore we find that    p_d = -fl + _ .[p_d ]    finally defining the field @xmath36 we obtain    z = 12_0 ^ 2 d_0 f(_0 ) ( lh ) f(_0 ) ,    where now @xmath37 and    h = e^212 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 + 2(_0 ) .",
    "one point observables are calculated as o((x))= 1z _ 0 ^ 2 d_0 f(_0 ) ( xh)o(_0)((l - x)h ) f(_0 ) , the extension to n - point functions being trivial . here for convenience and to highlight the different regimes we develop the notation .",
    "we write h = e^22 h^ * where h^ * = ^2_0 ^ 2 + a(_0 ) [ hst ] with @xmath38 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath39 periodic on @xmath40 $ ] are the periodic mathieu functions @xmath41 whose eigenvalues we denote by @xmath42 and where it is easy to see that the largest eigenvalue @xmath43 .",
    "hence in the case where @xmath44    z ~12_0 ^ 2d_0()f()^2 ( e^22l_0(a ) ) .",
    "[ eq : zthick ]    therefore @xmath45 and any boundary terms become insignificant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the bulk pressure is then @xmath46 .      in the case where @xmath49 is small",
    "one may evaluate @xmath50 in perturbation theory and we find that @xcite    _ 0(a )  =  12a^2  -  732a^4  +  29144a^6  -   68687294912a^8  +  ",
    ".[gamma0 ]    in this regime the average density is extensive and is given by    =  =   e^22ad_0(a)da  , [ rho ] the condition that @xmath49 is small is therefore equivalent to a  ~  /e 1  .",
    "this implies that the electrostatic energy is much greater than the contribution from the entropy . from equations ( [ p_d ] ,  [ gamma0 ] ,  [ rho ] ) the pressure",
    "is then given by the series p_bulk=  12  .",
    "[ p_sa ] this result was explained by lenard as an effect of dimerization .",
    "the leading term is independent of @xmath48 and is the perfect gas result for a density of @xmath51 .",
    "this is explained by the positive and negative charges binding in pairs to give , in leading order , a neutral gas with half the original particle density .",
    "the non - leading terms correspond to multipole interactions such as van der waals forces etc .",
    "the calculation of @xmath50 for large @xmath49 can be formulated as a perturbation series for @xmath52 in equation([hst ] ) obtained by expanding the cosine and writing h^ *  =  a  +  h_osc  +  o(a^4 )  , [ hst_osc ] where @xmath53 is the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian h_osc  =  ^2 ^ 2  -  a^2  .",
    "thus the perturbation theory is for the anharmonic terms in equation ( [ hst_osc ] ) using the basis of oscillator states associated with @xmath54 .",
    "the first term in the pressure is due to the @xmath55 term in equation ( [ hst_osc ] ) and gives the free gas contribution .",
    "the next correction arises from the ground state eigenvalue of the oscillator and is @xmath56 .",
    "this is the well - known debye - hckel term .",
    "we expect a power series in @xmath57 , but to carry out the perturbative expansion becomes increasingly difficult as the order increases .",
    "instead , we can formulate the problem as an expansion in feynman diagrams .",
    "a similar approach to the calculation of the electrostatic free energy of a system of fixed charge macroions has been used by coalson and duncan @xcite and ben - tai and coalson @xcite . in the bulk limit",
    "we write the feynman kernel for @xmath58 as ( l , a )  =  nd_-l/2^l/2dx  , [ k ] where @xmath15 is the normalization factor chosen so that @xmath59 . in the limit @xmath60 ( l , a )  =  ( _ 0(a)2l )  _ 0(a )  =   2l  .",
    "it is convenient to discretize @xmath7 so that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the lattice spacing",

    "this term cancels trivially with a simple @xmath62 divergence in the 1-loop graph for @xmath65 .",
    "we can now take the limit @xmath66 .",
    "the density , defined by equation ( [ rho ] ) , is given by  =  e^2a2 ( )  , [ rhocos ] and thus the second term in equation ( [ fd ] ) corresponds to the free gas term .",

    "standard dimensional analysis shows that the series obtained is in inverse powers of @xmath67 and that a diagram with @xmath70 loops behaves as @xmath71 . to three - loop order",

    "we show the computed value for @xmath72 compared with the predictions of the previous two sections .",
    "for convenience @xmath72 has been scaled by a factor of @xmath82 . as can be seen the curves from equations ( [ gamma0 ] and ( [ p_la ] ) fit very well except in the region @xmath83 where",
    "even so the discrepancy is not very large .",
    "when the intersurface distance of the film becomes small in the sense that @xmath84 is no longer large , then we may not apply the thermodynamic result ( [ eq : zthick ] ) .",

    "the stability of the film at small separations is determined by _",

    "if this term is positive then the film collapses to the point thickness @xmath94 . for this to happen",
    "one must have .",
    "the value of the surface charge @xmath95 is given by = -e ( -i(0 ) ) = -el  .",
    "[ eq : sigex ] hence over short distances the surface charge decays linearly as the two surfaces are brought together .",

    "there are two methods of interest which we detail in the following sections . for convenience of notation we shall work in units where @xmath7 is scaled by @xmath82 .",
    "that is , a factor of @xmath82 is absorbed into all length variables .",
    "the disjoining pressure and other properties of the film can be calculated using the even and odd mathieu functions that are the eigenfunctions of @xmath52 defined in equation ( [ hst ] ) .",
    "the kernel @xmath96 defined in equation ( [ k ] ) can be computed as an expansion on the mathieu function by resolution of the identity on the basis of these states . in this way",
    "the disjoining pressure may be in general be written as p_d(l ) = -e^22_n=1^(_0(a ) - _ n(a))c_n^2(_n(a)l ) _",
    "n=0^c_n^2(_n(a)l ) , [ p_mat ] where c_n = _ 0 ^ 2 d_n()((-i ) ) . if the eigenvalues of @xmath39 are arranged in descending order i.e. @xmath97 , the corresponding eigenfunctions are even about @xmath98 for @xmath99 even and odd about @xmath98 for @xmath99 odd .",

    "it is clear however that the disjoining pressure may become negative at smaller values of @xmath7 .",

    "there are no unusual features and the curves for the other values of @xmath90 in @xmath138 are of similar form .      the pressure @xmath74 is plotted versus @xmath7 for @xmath140 in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "the collapse region is again evident but it should be noted that it occurs only for a very narrow range of @xmath90 values . of course , @xmath90 is a parameter that is determined by other variables and is not fixed externally .",
    "the bulk pressure is no longer given by the large-@xmath49 expression ( equations ( [ p_la ] , [ p_la0 ] ) but is well fitted by the small-@xmath49 result ( equations ( [ gamma0 ] ) , [ p_sa ] ) .",
    "the prediction is @xmath141 and the computed value is @xmath142 .",
    "this value is shown for reference in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "the curves for the surface charge , @xmath126 , are similar to those of previous sections and are not reproduced here .",
    "the small @xmath7 behavior is again consistent with equation ( [ eq : sigex ] )",
    ".    the anion and cation number densities ( equation ( [ d_mat ] ) are plotted for @xmath143 and @xmath144 in figure [ f10 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that for both species the density falls sharply at the film surface and the anion density reaches a peak for the thicker films which is located only a short distance into the film .",
    "the position and shape of this peak is independent of thickness @xmath7 and seems to be a universal feature of the low temperature case .",
    "only the lowest 4 mathieu modes make an appreciable contribution since the effective charge is large and from equation ( [ d_mat ] ) this causes a strong exponential suppression on all but the lowest modes ( note that in equation ( [ d_mat ] ) a factor of @xmath82 is absorbed into all lengths ) . also , the values of @xmath90 in the collapse region decrease as @xmath48 increases and so the surface function @xmath145 ( equation ( [ f ] ) ) oscillates less fast and only has appreciable overlap with the lowest modes .",
    "for these reasons the species number densities are dominated by the contributions from the lowest modes and so show more structure at low temperature than at high temperature .",
    "this is to be expected since the electrostatic energy dominates the thermal energy .",
    "we have observed similar maxima in the density profiles for other values of @xmath48 if @xmath90 is sufficiently small .",
    "this is due again to the dominance of only a very few low - lying mathieu modes .",
    "the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory for our system may either be derived directly by standard thermodynamic techniques @xcite , or as the mean field theory for the field theory ( [ eq : ft ] ) .",
    "the theory has been used in a wide context in soft condensed matter physics and in particular to analyze the behavior of soap films in @xcite , and also in the context of colloidal stability @xcite . in general",
    "it is fair to say that it has been reasonably successful in predicting the physics of systems where interplane distances are reasonably large and for monovalent ionic species @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are ( again scaling so that @xmath27 ) = 2e ( e ) + e ( ( x ) ( e ( 0 ) ) + ( x - l ) ) ( e ( l ) ) ) , where here @xmath146 is the mean field electrostatic field . assuming symmetry about the point @xmath147 ( however see the comments in the conclusion ) and using the condition of electroneutrality ( which is a mean field assumption ) , the boundary conditions are |_0,l = d dx|_l2 = 0 interestingly @xmath146 appears as a purely imaginary saddle point of the theory ( [ eq : ft ] ) . in the region",
    "@xmath148 $ ] the above equation reduces to = 2e ( e ) , [ eq : pb1 ] with the boundary conditions |_l2 = 0 [ eq : pb2 ] and |_0 = -e ( e ( 0 ) ) = , [ eq : pb3 ] where @xmath95 is the surface charge .",
    "it easy to show that the mean field free energy over the bulk is @xcite    f_mf = ^l_0(^)^2dx  -  2(e ( 0 ) ) + 2l((e(l/2 ) ) - 1 )  .",
    "then we find p_d = 2 ( ( e_m ) - 1 )  , where @xmath149 is the midplane potential .",
    "one immediately sees that in the case @xmath150 then @xmath151 is a solution and the film is always marginally stable in the sense that @xmath152 . in general",
    "any non - zero @xmath90 gives a non - zero value of @xmath153 and hence the film is always stable for non - zero @xmath90 .",
    "this is clearly at variance with the exact results derived here .",
    "moreover , the mean field bulk pressure is @xmath154 which is only applicable to the limit @xmath155 or , equivalently , @xmath156 .    in general one must resort to a numerical solution of the above mean field equations . however in the case where @xmath7 is small such that @xmath146 varies",
    "only slightly we may use the approximation ,    = _ m + c ( x- l2)^2 .",
    "substituting this into equation ( [ eq : pb1 ] ) yields @xmath157 . using this in the boundary condition ( [ eq : pb3 ] ) then yields    l ( e _ m ) = -(e _ m ) + o(l^2 ) .    solving this yields    _ m = -12e ( 2l + 1 ) .",
    "hence in this limit p_d(l ) ~ [ eq : pdmf ] and ~- e. one sees that while the surface charge @xmath95 does decay to zero it does so as @xmath158 in comparison with the exact result ( [ eq : sigex ] ) .",
    "in addition the disjoining pressure ( [ eq : pdmf ] ) actually diverges rather than tending to a constant .    for infinitely thick films one may use the condition that @xmath159 in order to calculate the surface potential . in this case",
    "the surface potential is given by the equation    ( e(0 ) ) - 14 ^ 2 e^2(e(0 ) ) = 1 , from this we find that the physical solution is ( 0 ) = -1e ( 1 + e/ ) giving a surface charge = -e 1 + e/.    at intermediate distances one has to numerically solve the pb equations .",
    "for the cases discussed in section [ inter ] there is no agreement at all between the numerical solution to the pb equation and the exact result .",
    "this is to be expected since there is no collapse predicted by the pb equation .",
    "however , there is no agreement even on the rising part of the pressure curve at @xmath7 much greater than that at the pressure maximum .",
    "also , the values of @xmath72 are not close to the mean - field prediction of @xmath160 although for @xmath127 this value is approached .",
    "nevertheless , in this latter case there is still a large disagreement between the exact and mean - field curves .",
    "indeed , we have investigated very small values of @xmath48 for a large range of @xmath90 values but have not found any reliable agreement between the exact theory and the pb equation .",
    "the pb equation may be applicable for even smaller values of @xmath48 than we have investigated .",
    "indeed , a naive analysis of the applicability of the saddle point method for the theory ( [ eq : ft ] ) suggests that @xmath49 should be large , i.e. , either @xmath161 or @xmath162 , thus giving either @xmath112 or @xmath163 as the large parameter justifying the saddle point analysis .",
    "however , in the cases we have analyzed here , mean - field theory and the pb equation are of very little value in the analysis of the one - dimensional coulomb gas .",
    "in conclusion we have derived an exact solution for the one dimensional coulomb gas with boundary effects .",
    "surprisingly the mere presence of a boundary , without any surface adhesion term , leads to a reduction of the density near the boundary with respect to the bulk .",
    "this effect means that the disjoining pressure of the system is negative and the resulting film will tend to collapse . when @xmath164 we have shown that at sufficiently large distances the disjoining pressure must be positive , and hence a stable _ common _ film regime exists .",
    "however , if the value of @xmath90 is not too large a collapse phenomena may occur where the disjoining pressure decreases as the surfaces come together .",
    "the disjoining pressure may even become negative signalling the onset of strong attractive forces in the system ; this may well be the one dimensional version of the collapse to a nbf seen in experimental systems .",
    "we have also seen the possibility of secondary collapses in the parameter ranges we have studied ; it would be interesting if one could find an experimental system exhibiting a secondary collapse . in principle",
    "multiple collapses are possible , but we have yet to see more than two .",
    "poisson - boltzmann theory predicts a stable film for any non - zero value of @xmath90 and in addition the calculated mean field disjoining pressure is larger that that of the exact calculation .",
    "taking into account the full theory and all its correlations does indeed introduce an attractive interaction over and above the mean field result , in accordance with the calculations made in three dimensional systems using techniques beyond mean field theory @xcite .",
    "we would like to comment here that in our solution of the mean field equations we have , as is done throughout the literature , always assumed that the mean field solution is symmetric about the midplane of the film . in physical terms",
    "this seems quite plausible for thick films where the two planes do not interact and hence there can be no breaking of spatial symmetry .",
    "the variant of mean field theory used in @xcite uses this symmetric solution and the theory describes extremely well both surface tension data for sds bulk solutions and the disjoining pressure isotherms up to the point where the collapse occurs .",
    "one may show @xcite in the field theoretic sense that the mean field solutions we have found here and in @xcite are indeed stable local minima of the free energy and hence they at least describe a metastable state .",
    "the fact that the mean field solutions work so well in this context up to the collapse point suggest that another mean field solution with a broken spatial symmetry and possibly with a complex part may appear with a lower free energy than that of the symmetric real solution",
    ". this would also be consistent with the experimental indications ( and indeed conclusions that may be drawn from our exact solutions in 1 d ) that the transition to a newton black film is of first order .",
