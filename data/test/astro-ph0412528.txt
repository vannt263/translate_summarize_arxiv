    "one of the similarities of the next generation telescopes , also called extremely large telescopes , is their reliance on adaptive optics .",
    "therefore the selection of the sites for the new generation telescopes demands reliable studies of the turbulence vertical profiles , represented by the refractive index structure constant @xmath1 , and the velocity of the turbulance layers @xmath2 .",
    "the average velocity of the turbulance v@xmath3 , defined as function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is a key parameter because most quantities relevant to adaptive optics are directly related to v@xmath3 ( roddier , gilli & lund 1982 ) .",
    "thus , if it is possible to obtain v@xmath3 by a independent and reliable mean , the rest of the adaptive optics quantities can be estimated from v@xmath3 .",
    "sarazin & tokovinin ( 2002 ) have shown that for two sites in the north of chile , paranal , the site of the very large telescope and for cerro pachn , the site of gemini south , the average velocity of the turbulence v@xmath3 is clearly related to the wind velocity at 200@xmath0 mb pressure level . assuming a standard atmosphere",
    ", 200@xmath0 mb correspond to about 12 km above sea level . for their analysis",
    "they include data from 35 balloon flights .",
    "they compared the v@xmath3 obtained from the in situ measuremens with those obtained at 200@xmath0 mb from the noaa ( national oceanic and atmospheric administration ) global gridded upper air database ( gguas ) .",
    "the result is the linear relation v@xmath3 = @xmath4 , with a rms=2.6 m@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the wind velocity at ground level .",
    "the authors conclude that with moderate wind at ground level and an equal seeing quality , the existing and potential astronomical sites can be ranked in terms of suitability for adaptive optics simply by looking at the wind speed at 200@xmath0 mb .",
    "hence , a first evaluation of a site convinience for developing adaptive optics techniques can be the statistics of the wind speed at 200@xmath0 mb .",
    "moreover , the use of meteorological data bases for astronomical characterization offers the possibility of carrying out studies , under the same conditions , of different sites . here , we present the statistics of the 200@xmath0 mb wind velocity monthly variation for the mexican sites sierra negra and san pedro mrtir . we compare the results with those obtained for mauna kea , hawaii , paranal and la silla in chile , gamsberg in namibia and maidanak in uzbekistan .",
    "a detailed study about the canary islands observatories can be found in chueca et al .",
    "it must be emphasized that we are not presenting a full characterization of the sites .",
    "nevertheless we remark the quality of our sites regarding the high latitute wind speed as a very important parameter for adaptive optics .",
    "sierra negra is the site of the large millimeter telescope ( lmt / gtm ) , a 50  m antenna optimized for 1 - 3  mm observations , now under construction .",
    "it is located at 18@xmath7  59@xmath8  n latitude , 97@xmath7  18@xmath9  w longitude and an altitude of 4580 m above sea level , in the state of puebla , mexico .",
    "sierra negra is about 100  km west from the coast of veracruz in the gulf of mexico and 300  km from the pacific coast , within the national park pico de orizaba .",
    "the lmt is a bi - national project between mexico and the united states , led by the instituto nacional de astrofsica , ptica y electrnica ( inaoe ) in mexico and the university of massachusetts , at amherst , in the usa .",
    "i    with the development of the sierra negra site , the inaoe started to characterize its quality for observations in other wavelengths .",
    "because of its altitude and location , the site is intrinsically very dry , the opacity at 240  ghz goes down to @xmath10 , ( meza  et  al .",
    "2003 ) therefore the conditions are likely to be favorable for near / mid infrared observations",
    ". a median seeing of 0.73 arcsec was obtained by using a differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) during 127 nights .",
    "the data spans between february 2000 and november 2003 ( carrasco  et  al 2003a , avils 2004 ) .",
    "the meteorological conditions are quite mild for such a high altitude , snowfall is generally light throughout the year .",
    "the global median temperature is 1.2@xmath11c , the diurnal cycle is tipically only 2@xmath11c and the average temperature varies seasonally about 3@xmath11c .",
    "the global median wind velocity is 4 m@xmath5 , the first and third quartile are 2.2 m@xmath5 and 5.8 m@xmath5 , respectively with a diurnal wind speed median tipically of 3.6 m@xmath5 .",
    "the average wind speed varies seasonally less than 2 m@xmath5 ( carrasco et al .",

    "san pedro mrtir ( spm ) is the site of the observatorio astronmico nacional , located at 31@xmath702@xmath1246@xmath13  n latitute , 115@xmath7  29@xmath14  w longitude and a altitude of 2830 m above sea level , in baja california state , mexico .",

    "the site , administrated by the universidad nacional autnoma de mxico ( unam ) , is within a national park .",
    "it has three optical telescopes : 2  m , 1.5  m and a 0.84  m diameter . a study carried out between 1982 and 2002 , shows that the fraction of photometric nights was 64% while the fraction of spectroscopic nights was 81% ( tapia 2003 ) .",
    "futhermore , tapia remarks that the fractional number of totally clear , photometric nights increased considerably , from 54.2% prior to 1996 to 74.6% in the next seven years .",
    "the median visual extinction is @xmath15 mag / airmass ( schuster , parrao & guichard 2002 , parrao & schuster 2003 ) .",

    "the wind speed median is 3.9 m@xmath5 during the day and 5.3 m@xmath5 at night time ( michel , hiriart & chapela 2003 ) . in fact , the site characterization carried out over the years has proven that spm is indeed a very good site for optical / nir observations and one of the best sites ( cruz - gnzalez , avila & tapia 2003 ) .",
    "the noaa in the usa runs several climatological projects . within the noaa , the national climatic data center ( ncdc )",
    "is in charge of managing the resource of global climatological in - situ and remotely sensed data and information .",
    "weather data from the atmosphere are obtained from instrument packages such as radiosondes and rawinsondes carried by weather balloons that transmit the data back to a receiving station on the ground .",
    "the upper air data consists of temperature , relative humidity , atmospheric pressure and wind .    in a similar way",
    "the noaa climate diagnostics center ( cdc ) goal is to identify the nature and causes for climate variations on time scales ranging from a month to centuries .",
    "the cdc ncep / ncar ( national center for environmental prediction / national center for atmospheric research ) global reanalysis project is using the state - of - the - art analysis and forecast system to perform data assimilation using past data from 1948 to the present . the ncep s role is to use a current and fixed ( jan .",
    "1995 ) version of a data assimilation and operational forecast model .",
    "the task of ncar is to collect and organize many of the land and marine surface data archives , to provide these to ncep along with many observed satelite and aircraft observations , receive and store the output archives .",
    "the cdc derived ncep reanalysis products include over 80 different variables and several different coordinates systems at 0z , 6z , 12z , and 18z forecasted values .",
    "in particular , the derived ncep pressure level product provides , the monthly wind speed on a 2.5 degree global grid at 17 pressure levels , with about 200 km horizontal resolution ( kistler et al .",
    "we are using the monthly wind velocity at 200@xmath0 mb on the basis of four records per day between 1980 and 1995 .",
    "for our analysis we used the ncep / ncar reanalysis data base because it provides a more accurate determination of the monthly average wind speed than the gguas , used by sarazin & tokovinin ( 2002 ) , the fluctuations are more than a factor of two larger for the gguas than for the ncep data ( carrasco & sarazin 2003 ) .",
    "the coordinates of the sites under study are shown in table [ sites ] .",
    "costa rica ( san jos ) is included as a tropical place where there is not jet stream .",
    "two sets of coordinates are given for each site .",
    "the first ones are the geographic coordinates used as input to the data base , the next two columns correspond to the grid points closest to the geographical coordinates .",
    "the elevation in meters above sea level is included in the last column .    in tables",
    "[ ncep_1 ] and [ ncep_2 ] the wind velocities obtained from the ncep / ncar reanalysis data base are shown .",
    "the first column indicates the month number .",
    "for each site two values are reported .",
    "first , the wind speed obtained by averaging the monthly values over the 16 years period .",
    "second , the instantaneous rms fluctuations around the average .",
    "for the whole period , the annual average and the quadratic average of the monthly rms values are included .",
    "the latter represents a typical fluctuation of the wind speed .",
    "figures [ ncep_fit1 ] and [ ncep_fit2 ] show plots of the monthly average wind speed at 200@xmath0 mb for the site indicated , the error bars are the rms fluctuations . the plots are ordered in increasing absolute value of the latitude and grouped depending on the hemisphere : costa rica , sierra negra , mauna kea , spm and maidanak in the northern hemisphere , and gamsberg , paranal and la silla in the southern hemisphere .",
    "costa rica , where there is not jet stream is shown as a reference . for the northern sites as the latitute increases",
    "so does the average wind speed , therefore sierra negra presents the lowest average wind at 200  mb of all the sites analyzed , next is mauna kea , spm and maidanak .",
    "analogously , in the southern hemisphere as the absolute value of the latitude increases so does the average wind speed . from the southern sites",
    "gamsberg has the lowest annual average wind speed at 200  mb .",
    "the seasonal trend , slowest wind in the summer , is the same for the northern sites sierra negra , mauna kea and spm and to less extent for maidanak .",
    "similarly , for the sites in the southern hemisphere the months with lower wind velocity at 200  mb correspond to the southern summer .",
    "table [ summary ] shows a summary of the wind velocity annual average .",
    "here we include the uncertainty in the annual average determination , given by the annual rms fluctuations divided by @xmath16 where n is equal to 12 .",
    "sierra negra is 3.5@xmath17 , 5.7@xmath17 , 1.6@xmath17 , 6.9@xmath17 , 7.5@xmath17 below mauna kea , maidanak , gamsberg , paranal and la silla .",
    "the wind velocity annual average for spm is 1.2@xmath17 , 1.6@xmath17 , 2.6@xmath17 below maidanak , paranal and la silla respectively . on the other hand , spm is 1@xmath17 , 1.2@xmath17 , above mauna kea and gamsberg respectively . for mauna kea ,",
    "the annual average wind velocity is 2.4@xmath17 , 2.6@xmath17 , 4.1@xmath17 below maidanak , paranal and la silla respectively .",
    "in contrast , mauna kea is 1.6@xmath17 above gamsberg , giving a statistically tangible site ranking .",
    "although annual averages have been computed for all sites it can be shown that the wind speed is not a constant function of time .",
    "considering that error weighted averages minimize @xmath18 , we tested the hypothesis of a constant wind speed @xmath19 .",
    "the values obtained are shown in table  [ constante ] where @xmath20 are the error weigthed average wind speed .",
    "the p@xmath21 `` hypothesis rejection '' probabilities are indicated for each site .",
    "the hypothesis of a constant wind speed is rejected at the 99.9% confidence level for sierra negra , san pedro mrtir , mauna kea , paranal and gamsberg .",
    "we also tested the alternative hypothesis of a wind speed following @xmath22    with three fitting parameters : @xmath23 , the average wind speed ; @xmath24 the amplitude of the wind speed modulation and @xmath25 the time of the year of minimum wind speed .",
    "the values of these three parameters , determined through simultaneous @xmath18 minimization , are shown in table  [ modulada ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath18 probabilities are all compatible with the hypothesis , which in most cases provides a very good fit to the data .",
    "minimum wind speed is reached between june and august in the northern sites and six months earlier for the three southern sites ( paranal , la silla and gamsberg ) . even for the sites where a constant wind speed can not be rejected ( costa rica , la silla and maidanak )",
    ", a yearly modulation provides fits with lower @xmath18 probabilities .",
    "average 200  mb wind speeds are only a broad indication of the site properties ; the yearly modulation should be taken into account , as they can be as large as the average wind speed .",
    "we note that @xmath26 for sierra negra and san pedro mrtir .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ ncep_fit1 ] and figure  [ ncep_fit2 ] .",
    "in may 2000 , measurements of the turbulence profiles @xmath27 and the velocity of the turbulent layers @xmath28 were performed during 16 nights at spm , using the generalized scidar ( gs ) of the laboratoire universitaire dastrophysique de nice , france .",

    "( 2004a ) and avila et al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "the interest here is two - fold : first , the comparison of the values of @xmath29 at spm for may , obtained from the ncep / ncar reanalysis data base , with the values of the velocities measured with the gs between 10 and 15 km above sea level , @xmath30 .",
    "second , the comparison of the values of @xmath31 obtained from the empirical relation proposed by sarazin & tokovinin ( 2002 ) with the actual values calculated from the @xmath32 and @xmath33 profiles measured at spm , @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gs profiles used in this calculation do not include the turbulence arising inside the telescope dome .    as shown in table 2 , for may , the mean and rms values of @xmath29 are 28.7 and 7.1 m@xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath30 are 26.7 and 12.6 m@xmath5 .",
    "the number of @xmath35 values used for these estimations is 4191 .",
    "the agreement of both estimates is remarkable .    for each simultaneous measurement of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , one value of @xmath34",
    "is calculated by : @xmath36^{3/5}.\\ ] ] this computation was performed for the 3016 measured profiles .",
    "the mean and rms values of @xmath34 are 12.2 and 5.7 m@xmath5 , which perfectly agrees with v@xmath3 = @xmath37 m@xmath5 .",
    "this simple comparison supports the empirical relation proposed by sarazin & tokovinin ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the seasonal variations of the monthly average wind velocity at 200 mb for the period between 1980 - 1995 , for sierra negra , spm , mauna kea , paranal , la silla , gamsberg , maidanak and costa rica ; the latter to be used as a reference .",
    "we used the monthly average data based on a 4 records per day , provided by the noaa ncep / ncar reanalysis data set .",
    "we have shown that sierra negra has the lowest yearly average wind velocity of the sites analysed .",
    "the wind speed at 200@xmath0 mb in spm is comparable to that of mauna kea , and in some months probably lower .",
    "spm annual average velocity is lower than for paranal , la silla and maidanak . following the criteria that the average velocity of the turbulence v@xmath3 is linearly related to the wind velocity at 200@xmath0 mb pressure level , que conclude that sierra negra and spm are amongst the best observatory sites suitable for adaptive optics techniques",
    "furthermore , we have also shown that for all the sites analyzed there is a annual wind speed modulation that should be taken into account when comparing the quality of different sites .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the wind speed modulation is comparable to the mean wind speed for sierra negra and spm .    in the case of spm , by analyzing v@xmath3 and @xmath30 data obtained with a gs during a 16 days campaign , we found that the wind velocity @xmath30 measured is consistent with the @xmath29 value from the ncep / ncar reanalysis data base .",
