    "the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath2 of the black hole formed by the coalescence of a black - hole binary is a complicated function of the initial masses and spins of the two constituent black holes .",
    "[ we consider inspiralling systems circularized by radiation reaction ] .",
    "the function @xmath3 is a useful diagnostic for comparing analytical approaches to the dynamics of coalescing binaries to the results of three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "here we shall consider the simple case of _ non - spinning _ binaries , where @xmath4 becomes simply a function of the symmetric mass ratio @xmath5 ( which satisfies @xmath6 ) .",
    "as far as we know , the first estimate of @xmath4 was made in 2000 @xcite , on the basis of a new analytical approach to the general relativistic two - body dynamics , the _ effective - one - body _",
    "( eob ) approach @xcite , at a time where no reliable numerical simulations of coalescing black hole binaries were yet available .",
    "this estimate was @xmath7 for @xmath8 ( i.e. for the equal mass case ) , and was based on estimating the ratio @xmath9 at a `` matching radius '' @xmath10 where the two - black - hole system was replaced by a unique , ringing black hole .",
    "this estimate used a 2.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) accurate description of the dynamics down to @xmath11 , and neglected the energy and angular momentum losses during the ringdown . in 2001 , a combination of full numerical simulations with a `` close - limit '' approximation @xcite describing the ringing final black hole led to a similar estimate , namely @xmath12 for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this estimate was revised downwards in 2002 , to @xmath13 @xcite , when a better ( _ lazarus_-based ) way of bridging the far- and close - limit approaches indicated that the angular momentum losses were larger than previously estimated . indeed ,",
    "@xcite had estimated the total angular momentum loss after crossing the last stable orbit ( lso )   to be around @xmath0 , and the corresponding energy loss to be around @xmath14 . [",
    "the eob approach had estimated an energy loss beyond the lso of about @xmath15 , half of it emitted during the plunge and the other half during the ringdown  @xcite ] .",
    "by contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite estimated the angular momentum loss to be around @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , an update of the analytical eob estimate  @xcite using the now available 3.5pn accurate description of the two - body dynamics showed that increasing the pn accuracy of the dynamics ( from 2.5pn to 3.5pn ) had the effect of decreasing the final spin parameter from @xmath7 to @xmath17 ( again for @xmath8 , and again when neglecting the angular momentum loss below the matching radius @xmath11 ) .",
    "the estimates just recalled belong to a `` prehistoric '' era where , for a variety of reasons , numerical simulations did not exhibit a very convincing convergence among themselves , nor towards analytical results ( see , however ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "this era has recently ended thanks to remarkable breakthroughs in numerical relativity .",
    "different groups have finally succeded in numerically simulating the merger of two black holes of comparable masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 , possibly with spin , and their results exhibit convincing internal convergence , and a nice mutual consistency  @xcite . in the particular case of non - spinning black holes with equal masses , @xmath20 , different groups now agree on the value @xmath21 ( which is within the span of the `` prehistoric '' estimates recalled above ) .",
    "the most extensive analysis of the final angular momentum of coalescing black holes ( in the non - spinning case ) to date has been carried out by gonzalez et al .",
    "@xcite : they have considered a large sample of unequal - mass systems , corresponding to a symmetric mass ratio @xmath22 varying in the range @xmath23 , and have accurately determined the variation of @xmath4 with @xmath22 within this range .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize and update the analytical eob estimates @xcite of @xmath24 recalled above , both by explicitly considering general values of @xmath22 and by improving the previous eob treatments of the physical ingredients which are crucial in determining the value of @xmath4 .",
    "our motivation for this study is two - fold : on the one hand , we wish to see to what extent numerical results can be reproduced by analytical ( eob ) estimates , and on the other hand we wish to understand , on this example , what are the physical ingredients which are crucial in accurately determining the plunge , merger and ringdown dynamics of coalescing black holes .",
    "let us recall that the eob approach to the general relativistic two - body dynamics is a _ non - perturbatively resummed _",
    "analytic technique which has been developed in refs .",
    "this technique uses , as basic input , the results of pn theory , such as : ( i ) pn - expanded equations of motion for two point - like bodies , ( ii ) pn - expanded radiative multipole moments , and ( iii ) pn - expanded energy and angular momentum fluxes at infinity . for the moment ,",
    "the most accurate such results are the 3pn conservative dynamics @xcite , and the 3.5pn energy flux  @xcite .",
    "then the eob approach `` packages '' this pn - expanded information in special _ resummed _ forms which extend the validity of the pn results beyond the expected weak - field - slow - velocity regime into ( part of ) the strong - field - fast - motion regime .",
    "the aim being to use the eob approach for analytically describing the last inspiralling orbits , the transition from inspiral to plunge , and the plunge itself down to a `` matching radius '' @xmath25 small enough to allow one to match there the plunge waveform to a ringdown one .",
    "the basic new ingredient used below to improve the previous eob estimates of @xmath4 is an approximate treatment of the energy and angular momentum losses during ringdown .",
    "these losses were neglected in  @xcite .",
    "our approximation will consist in estimating these losses by _ rescaling _ ( proportionally to @xmath26 ) the losses obtained by numerically studying the test - mass limit  la regge - wheeler - zerilli  @xcite .",
    "we shall also study the effect of the radiation reaction force during the plunge . instead of using ( as in @xcite ) a naive analytic continuation of the radiation reaction appropriate to the inspiral phase",
    ", we shall also use another pad resummed radiation reaction force , which does not assume the validity of kepler s law @xmath27const . during the plunge  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the recent regge - wheeler - zerilli - like study of the waveform emitted by plunging test - masses  @xcite has shown that this modified radiation reaction stays closer to the `` exact '' gravitational wave angular momentum flux computed  la regge - wheeler - zerilli .",

    "the complicated pn - expanded relative dynamics ( in the center of mass frame ) of the binary system of masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 is mapped into the simpler geodesic dynamics of a particle of mass @xmath29 moving in some effective background geometry ( in schwarzschild gauge ) @xmath30 here , and below , we work with the dimensionless reduced variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 ; ( @xmath34 ) are polar coordinates in the _ effective _ problem that describe the relative motion.the coefficients of the effective metric at the 3pn approximation  @xcite read @xmath35 note that we work with the pn expansion of the quantity @xmath36 , rather than with the @xmath37 metric coefficient @xmath38 .

    "recall that @xmath39 is equal to @xmath40 in the schwarzschild case ( which corresponds to the test - mass limit @xmath41 ) . ]",
    "though the eob packaging of the complicated original pn dynamics into the much simpler metric coefficients @xmath42 already represents an efficient resummation of pn - expanded results , it is quite useful , especially at 3pn , to further resum the ` packages ' @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , a general feature of the eob philosophy is to smoothly connect the eob structures to their @xmath41 limit  @xcite . here ,",
    "this can be done by replacing the ( taylor expanded ) metric coefficients given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a])-([eq : d ] ) with suitable pad approximants . the simplest , and most robust , choices consist in using , as metric functions , the following definitions @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44$].=1/(1 + 6\\nu u^2    -2(3\\nu-26)\\nu u^3)$ ] where @xmath45 , while @xmath46 $ ] is explicitly given in eq .",

    "it is , however , convenient because it magnifies the radial axis in a crucial region , and prevents any excessive growth of the radial momentum during the plunge .",

    "[ as an example of the importance of higher multipoles for smaller @xmath22 s let us mention that we indeed found , for @xmath144 a quadrupole - only matched value of @xmath145 which is roughly half the scaled value @xmath146 .    as a further remark , we point out that our analytical results above suggest that a simple quadratic expression @xmath147 should provide a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "and indeed , fitting the data of  @xcite with this function , provides a good fit when @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , this fit is found to stay close to our best analytical predictions for the range @xmath128 not covered by numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , for @xmath150 , this gives @xmath151 , to be compared with , say , @xmath152 , while for @xmath153 , this gives @xmath154 to be compared with , say , @xmath155 .",
    "note also that the analytically expected value in the @xmath41 limit is given by @xmath156 , where the analytical value @xmath157 for the @xmath158 coefficient derives from the well known specific angular momentum of a test particle at the lso .",
    "the slight difference between @xmath159 and @xmath160 is probably due to the deviations from analyticity in @xmath22 , as @xmath41 , implied by the appearance of strange fractional powers of @xmath22 ( integer powers of @xmath161 ) during the transition between the lso and the plunge , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that , though we focussed here on nonspinning binaries , we intend to study , within the eob approach , the dimensionless spin parameter of _ spinning _ black - hole binaries . indeed , not only is the function @xmath3 a useful diagnostics for comparing analytical and numerical results , but it has also an important physical meaning .",
    "if the cosmic censorship conjecture is correct , this function should always stay smaller than 1 , even if the individual spins take their maximum kerr values @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "both leading - order eob analytical results  @xcite , and recent full - scale numerical  @xcite results have indicated that this is indeed the case .",
    "it would be , however , quite interesting to improve the eob estimates beyond the leading order , and to compare them in detail with numerical results .",
