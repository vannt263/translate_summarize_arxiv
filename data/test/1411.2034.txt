    "this cluster s color - magnitude diagram displays a few unusual features that heighten interest in this object , including a well - defined binary sequence falling above the main sequence , several alleged blue horizontal - branch stars ( platais et al . 2011 ) , which is unusual for a metal - rich stellar population ( brogaard et al . 2012 ) , along with a white - dwarf cooling sequence that exhibits two luminosity peaks ( bedin et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "other unusual aspects of ngc 6791 are the color - width of the red - giant branch ( rgb ; kinman 1965 ) and color variations of the main - sequence turn - off stars ( twarog et al .",
    "these features could be explained as either extended star formation ( over @xmath1 1 gyr ) , a process not identified in any other open cluster , or , spatial variations in the reddening ( twarog et al .",
    "2011 ; platais et al . 2011 ; brogaard et al .",
    "a recent result that relates to the possibility of extended star formation in ngc 6791 is from geisler et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who found two distinct groups differing in their respective sodium abundances .",
    "these two na - abundance groups were proposed to be two separate stellar populations within ngc 6791 ; this would be the first time such distinct stellar populations had been identified in an open cluster , although this is now commonly found in most globular clusters ( gratton et al .",
    "these distinct populations are responsible for the na and o abundance anti - correlations which are the signature of a globular cluster . as ngc 6791",
    "is among the most massive open clusters , whether it has anti - correlations in the light elements is critical for setting the lower limit in mass where such variations appear ( e.g. geisler et al .",

    "( 2014 ) found that the na abundances in a sample of ngc 6791 members can be described by a single na abundance to within @xmath1 0.1 dex .",
    "due to its high metallicity ( as well as location within the _ kepler _ field of view ) , ngc 6791 was targeted as a calibration cluster by the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ; majewski et al .",
    "2012 ; zasowski et al . 2013 ) , one of four experiments that are part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ; eisenstein et al . 2011 ) .",
    "apogee obtained h - band high - resolution spectra of red giants with the goal of measuring radial velocities and chemical abundances of up to 15 elements in over 100,000 stars in the galactic bulge , disk , and halo .",
    "ngc 6791 was selected for the present analysis due to both its high metallicity , which places it at the high end of the apogee target metallicities , and the possibility that it contains more than one stellar generation . in this letter ,",
    "abundance results for iron , oxygen , and sodium are presented to investigate whether the selected sample reveals two sodium populations .",
    "apogee data are obtained with a cryogenic , bench - mounted , 300-fiber spectrograph ( wilson et al . 2010 ) attached to the sloan 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "the apogee spectra are high - resolution ( r=@xmath6/@xmath10@xmath6@xmath1 22,500 ) and span the wavelength range from @xmath615,100  - @xmath617,000 , with spectra recorded on three separate detectors .",
    "gaps between the detectors result in three spectral regions covering roughly @xmath615,100  - @xmath615,800 , @xmath615,900  - @xmath616,400 , and @xmath616,500  - @xmath616,900 .",
    "an automated data processing pipeline for apogee ( nidever et al .",
    ", in preparation ) produces one - dimensional , wavelength - calibrated , flux - calibrated spectra .",
    "these spectra have had terrestrial airglow lines removed via dedicated sky fibers in each field , and have telluric absorption lines ( from h@xmath11o , co@xmath11 , and ch@xmath12 ) corrected using measurements from fibers placed on early - type stars in each field .",
    "twenty - nine red - giant members of ngc 6791 have been observed with apogee ; their membership has been discussed in frinchaboy et al .",
    "all of the observed spectra were inspected and had similar s / n at a given magnitude ; overall s / n increased for the brighter targets and was roughly the same ( 10 - 20% ) across the 3 detectors .",
    "eleven targets with stellar parameters covering the rgb , as well as the rc , were selected for this study ( table 1 ) .",

    "although there are many fe i lines in the apogee region , the advantage of using this smaller set of iron lines is that they suffer less from blending with other features , thus being to a certain degree independent of the adopted c , n , and o abundances .",
    "in addition , these lines cover a range in line strength , which makes them suitable for estimating the microturbulent velocity parameter .",
    "iron abundances were derived for a range of microturbulent velocities ; the adopted microturbulence was the one that produced the smallest iron abundance scatter , which also corresponds to near - zero slopes between a(fe ) and line strength .",

    "the star shown , 2m19211007 + 3750008 , is one of the hotter giants analyzed ( t@xmath2=4435k ) and was chosen for illustration because the oh lines become weak in the hotter giants ; here the lines reach about 10 - 15% in depth .",
    "the small @xmath11 - 2% deviations from a smooth spectrum are caused by imperfect subtraction of telluric emission lines in these same oh lines observed in the star .",
    "the solid curves are synthetic spectra with three different oxygen abundances , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the determination of oxygen abundances from oh lines requires that the carbon abundances ( derived from co lines ) , and to a lesser degree the nitrogen abundances ( derived from cn lines ) , are all solved self - consistently and that the molecular equilibrium is satisfied ( e.g. , cunha & smith 2006 ; ryde et al .",
    "the details concerning the co and cn lines / bandheads used in our analysis can be found in smith et al .",

    "the mean iron abundance for the target stars is quite enhanced relative to solar , confirming previous results in the literature that ngc 6791 , although very old , is among the most metal - rich populations in the galaxy .",

    "in addition , geisler et al . (",

    "it is not expected that there would be a dependence of the na abundance with t@xmath2 , which maps stellar evolution along the rgb .",
    "the values of [ na / fe ] derived here exhibit a small increase with decreasing temperature , but the change is rather small , at about 0.15 dex over @xmath11100k .",
    "the two hottest stars in our sample are clump giants , and have already evolved up the rgb , to low values of t@xmath2 , and then moved to the higher - temperature rc after having undergone the he - core flash .",
