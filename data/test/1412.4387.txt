    "recent experimental findings concerning the existence of magnetically polarized edge state in graphene nanoribbons @xcite provide a sound motivation for theoretical studies of magnetism in geometrically constraint graphene .",
    "the presence of edge and further reduction of dimensionality of graphene below two significantly modifies its electronic structure , causing the emergence of early - predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite edge states . on the other hand",
    ", it also enables the design of the energy spectrum @xcite , which crucially shapes the magnetic behaviour .",
    "magnetism arising in zero - dimensional graphene - based nanostructures ( nanoflakes , quantum dots , nanoribbons ) as a result of the presence of edge and modification of electronic structure has recently collected rich literature @xcite .",
    "the potential for spintronics applications has been proven by the proposals of numerous graphene nanoflake - based devices ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the description of spin - polarized transport through graphene nanostructures was already a goal of numerous studies @xcite .",
    "this supports hopes for development of carbon - based spintronics .",
    "the key feature for spintronics is the ability to control the magnetic properties .",
    "therefore , one of the flourishing fields of exploration is the influence of external fields on the magnetic properties of graphene and nanographenes . within this scope of studies",

    "the effect of magnetic field on magnetism in graphene - based structures has been also investigated @xcite .",
    "however , it is rather rare to study the common influence of both fields on the properties of graphene @xcite .    in order to extend our previous theoretical works concerning the sole effect of electric field @xcite or magnetic field @xcite on selected aspects of magnetism in some graphene nanoflakes , we perform the present study . for example , ref .",
    "@xcite was focused strongly on indirect coupling between external magnetic planes mediated by a graphene nanostructure and mainly on the possibility of controlling it with electric field .",
    "therefore , our present aim is to investigate the combined effect of external in - plane electric and magnetic field and to construct the ground state spin phase diagram of some monolayer graphene nanostructures .",
    "the calculations presented in the paper are based on the tight binding model with hubbard term ( in mfa ) , supplemented with electrostatic potential term and zeeman term .",
    "our systems of interest belong to a class of very small graphene quantum dots , so that the strategy to obtain them experimentally is likely a bottom - top approach , i.e. a procedure based on some molecular precursors . in such context",
    ", it should be strongly emphasized that some of the nanographenes with shapes and sizes corresponding to our interest in the present work have been recently synthesized within such scheme , what paved the way towards characterization of their magnetic properties @xcite and served as a motivation for the present research .",
    "the experimental development of the class of carbon - based nanostructures under discussion would allow to extend the range of systems in which the control over magnetism by electric field was proven in experiment beyond classical semiconducting systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the system of interest as well as theoretical model and numerical results will be discussed in details in the following sections of the paper .",
    "the system of interest in the present paper is a monolayer graphene nanostructure ( nanoflake or quantum dot ) in external in - plane electric and magnetic field .",

    "also the example magnetic field direction is shown ( however , it can be an arbitrary other in - plane direction ) .",
    "each nanostructure is composed of @xmath1 carbon atoms , belonging to two interpenetrating sublattices ( marked with filled and empty symbols ) .",
    "our interest is focused on two classes of graphene nanoflakes ( gnfs ) .",

    "we have selected such shapes of graphene nanostructures in general to avoid studying the commonly discussed case of spin - polarized zigzag edge state , for example in zigzag - edged triangular nanoflakes @xcite or in zigzag - edged nanoribbons @xcite .",
    "we would rather concentrate on the structures possessing armchair edges to avoid zero - field magnetic polarization .",
    "moreover , the present calculations @xcite indicate that for some shapes and orientations of the nanostructures the screening effects for the electric field are particularly weak .",
    "the same factor limits our interests to nanostructures of small sizes ( see also the discussion in our work @xcite ) .",
    "we should emphasize here that in order to avoid metallic character of our structures , we consider the smallest , molecular - like nanoflakes with well separated energy states and with a significant gap between highest occupied state and lowest unoccupied electronic state .    the goal of the model we use is to capture magnetic properties which result from the behaviour of @xmath6 electrons in graphene nanostructures .",
    "these electrons contribute the energy states close to the fermi level for charge - neutral nanoflakes . in the present work",
    "we describe the behaviour of the mentioned charge carriers by means of the following tight - binding based hamiltonian in real space:@xcite @xmath7 in the first term , @xmath8 is the hopping integral between nearest - neighbour carbon sites .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 for all nearest - neighbour bonds in triangular graphene nanoflakes with armchair edges . on the contrary , for ultrashort pieces of graphene nanoribbons with armchair side edges and zigzag terminations , we assume that @xmath10 with @xmath11 for outermost bonds at the armchair edges@xcite . for the remaining nearest - neighbour pairs",
    "we take @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is usually set as 2.7 ev @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath12 can serve as an useful energy scale in further considerations .",
    "the operators @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) create ( annihilate ) an electron of spin @xmath15 at lattice site @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the number of such electrons .",
    "the tight - binding term is supplemented with hubbard term , which is considered within mfa , thus neglecting the products of fluctuations @xmath18 .",
    "the on - site effective energy is taken as @xmath19 ( see @xcite , where such an assumption is justified for both charge - neutral and weakly doped structures ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that graphene and graphene nanoflakes do not belong to strongly correlated systems .    in order to account for the external in - plane electric field @xmath20 along @xmath0 direction , the electrostatic potential term is added .",
    "moreover , the external in - plane magnetic field @xmath21 is introduced by means of zeeman term , where @xmath22 is the zeeman energy parameter .",
    "let us mention that the in - plane orientation of magnetic field does not lead to the peierls substitution@xcite , because the hopping integrals are only modified in presence of in - plane component of the vector potential of the magnetic field .",
    "the horizontal electric field is assumed to originate from the gates between which the graphene nanostructure can be placed . in our considerations",
    "we use the normalized electric field , @xmath23",
    ". it might be useful to mention that for graphene nanostructures , the unity value of this normalized field would correspond roughly to 2 v /  .",
    "regarding the magnetic field , let us mention that the source of zeeman term present in our model may be either external magnetic field or , even more likely , it can result from exchange bias originating from the magnetic substrate on which graphene nanostructures can be deposited .",
    "let us focus on the second possibility , being particularly interesting in the light of recent experimental achievements concerning growth of graphene on magnetic insulator euo or yttrium iron garnet ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) as well as corresponding theoretical works about substrates such as euo and bifeo@xmath24@xcite .",
    "let us mention that ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the exchange field to be tunable via external pressure varying the distance between graphene and substrate and the calculated values of exchange splitting reach 150 mev , what corresponds to @xmath25 about 0.05 . following the discussion regarding the exchange splitting in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be estimated that placement of graphene on magnetic substrates with even higher critical temperature that europium oxide would increase significantly the exchange splitting .",
    "another scenario can be connected with inducing the splitting with magnetic impurities ( e.g. @xcite or functionalization with molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "such possibilities extend significantly the potential interest in the presented phase diagram by including substrate or magnetic proximity effects .",
    "let us now discuss some features of mean field approximation to the hubbard model which we use in our work .",
    "such an approach has a quite rich record in the recent literature on graphene magnetism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "first we mention that this approximation breaks the rotational symmetry in spin space which is present in the original hubbard term ( @xmath26 ) . as a consequence",
    ", the total spin does not commute with the mfa hamiltonian and is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "however , @xmath27-component of the total spin , @xmath28 is well defined for the eigenstates of mfa hamiltonian . therefore",
    ", in all further considerations , by total spin we will mean the @xmath27 component of it .",
    "secondly , we may discuss briefly the mfa against other methods of solving the hubbard model for graphene nanostructures . in comparison with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and",
    "exact diagonalization performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been found that mfa provides a good tool to characterize the properties provided that @xmath29 is not excessively large .",
    "in particular , the most important quantity from our point of view is the total ground state energy , the knowledge of which is crucial for the construction of ground state phase diagrams .",
    "the comparison of this energy obtained within mfa and by exact diagonalization ( smaller quantum dot systems ) and qmc ( larger quantum dot systems ) yields the very good consistency for @xmath30 .",
    "another quantity is the total @xmath27 component of spin ( or staggered magnetization for antiferromagnetic orderings ) .",
    "this quantity calculated within mfa was also very close to the predictions of exact diagonalization and even closer for larger system solved by qmc for @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , ref .",
    "@xcite supports the applicability of mfa to the present model for the choice of @xmath32 .",
    "also in ref .",
    "@xcite mfa has been discussed vs. qmc results for zigzag nanoribbon systems with the result that it provides a quantitatively reliable picture for nanoribbons wide enough .",
    "also the sign of magnetic correlations is reproduced correctly ( however mfa tends to overestimate somehow the range of correlations and may predict excessively robust magnetic orderings @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that mfa provides a good reference point for studies of phase diagrams of graphene nanostructures of various size and shape , not being severely limited by rapidly growing computational demands , thus applicable to considerably large systems described by real - space hamiltonians without translational symmetry . also let us mention its favourable comparison with recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ eq : eq1 ] ) can be decomposed into the form of @xmath33 .",
    "then the pair of hamiltonians @xmath34 , @xmath35 can be subject to simultaneous , self - consistent numerical diagonalization starting from random initial conditions for @xmath36 until the convergence of eigenvalues @xmath37 as well as convergence of charge densities @xmath36 is reached@xcite . in the present work we used lapack @xcite package for this purpose .",
    "the diagonalization was performed in presence of constant total number @xmath38 of charge carriers .",
    "the situation of @xmath39 ( one @xmath6 electron per carbon atom ) corresponds to charge neutrality of the nanostructure , while @xmath40 describes doping with electrons ( @xmath41 ) or holes ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the diagonalization procedure was repeated many times to verify whether the true ground state , characterized by the minimal total energy of the charge carriers @xmath43 , was reached . moreover ,",
    "all the @xmath44 and @xmath45 values adding up to @xmath46 were tested to find the configuration minimizing the energy .",
    "the performed ground - state calculations correspond to @xmath47 . as a result of the numerical procedure , @xmath27 component of the total spin as well as @xmath27 components of spin densities @xmath48",
    "were obtained .",
    "this allowed to construct ground - state phase diagrams in electric and magnetic field .",
    "total spin ground - state phase diagram for triangular nanoflake with armchair edges consisting of @xmath49 hexagons , for charge - neutral case ( a ) , doping with a single hole ( b ) and doping with a single electron ( c ) . ]",
    "we commence the discussion of the numerical results obtained within the model described above by presenting the total spin phase diagram , in which stability ranges of phases with various values of ( @xmath27 component of ) total spin @xmath50 are determined as a function of normalized external electric field @xmath23 and normalized external magnetic field @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) , where the borders between phases of different values of total spin are indicated as a function of external electric field and external magnetic field . let us emphasize that in absence of external fields the nanoflake does not exhibit net magnetic moment , what is in concert with the ( second ) lieb theorem @xcite , since the number of carbon atoms in both sublattices is equal and the nanostructure is not doped with charge ( i.e. we deal with half - filling of the available energy states ) . for low @xmath20 fields ,",
    "such a nonmagnetic state is rather persistent and survives up to high magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , below some critical magnetic field ( for @xmath53 ) also the applied electric field does not enforce any transition to @xmath54 phase . above the critical @xmath55",
    ", electric field causes a finite range of state with total spin of @xmath56 to emerge . at moderate electric fields",
    "it is soon replaced with @xmath57 when magnetic field increases . however , the range of @xmath56 ordering builds up also at strongest @xmath20 for @xmath55 high enough . in the vicinity of this range",
    "we also notice a phase border directly between @xmath58 and @xmath57 .    in order to analyse the effect of weak charge - doping on the phase diagram , we present fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) and ( c ) , where the same nanostructure is considered , but doped with a single charge carrier - hole ( @xmath59 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) and electron ( @xmath60 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c )",
    ". first , let us notice that the sign of charge doping is important for the phase diagram , since both plots for @xmath61 are different . for both cases of doping , spin @xmath62",
    "is predicted for the absence of external fields , due to odd total number of electrons .",
    "this low - spin phase persists in the whole studied range of @xmath20 unless @xmath63 exceeds some critical value , which is significantly higher for electron doping ( @xmath64 ) than for hole doping ( @xmath65 ) . for hole doping ,",
    "a range of spin-@xmath66 ordering emerges at moderate electric field and becomes wider as @xmath55 rises .",
    "only a limited area of phase with @xmath67 is present for high magnetic field . on the other hand , for electron doping",
    ", the ordering with @xmath68 appears at higher magnetic fields , and becomes soon replaced with @xmath67 .",
    "the remarkable feature is the disappearance of the higher spin state , which has been found for charge neutral nanostructures at highest electric fields for @xmath55 large enough .",

    "inset presents the analogous dependence of normalized derivative of total energy with respect to electric field . ]    in order to explain the mechanism of the observed magnetic polarization under the influence of external magnetic or electric field , let us refer to the behaviour of the single particle energy states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we present the evolution of the single electron energies ( for occupied states only ) for a charge - neutral triangular nanoflake with armchair edges with @xmath49 ( the phase diagram of which has been presented in the previous figure ) .",
    "let us remind that in our self - consistent procedure , the energies of single electron states depend on the total charge distribution and on occupation of all the states , i.e. on the total number of electrons in the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) we analyse the behaviour of energies as a function of magnetic field for constant electric field of @xmath69 .",
    "only a few occupied states with highest energies are plotted , including the highest occupied molecular orbital ( but equal number of spin - up and spin - down states is omitted ) . for fields below @xmath73 ,",
    "the nanoflake is in non - magnetic state with @xmath58 , so that equal number of electrons occupy spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "let us observe that due to presence of nonzero magnetic field no spin degeneracy takes place and the energies of spin - up and spin - down states are splitted ( the splitting varies quasi - linearly with the field and states with opposite spin show opposite slopes ) .",
    "the curves for spin - up and spin - down states have common origin at zero magnetic field , since without field the states are spin - degenerate . for the fields in the range of @xmath74 the state with @xmath56 emerges .",
    "this is microscopically reflected in the fact that it is more energetically favourable for one electron of spin - down to skip to another state with spin up , so total spin rises by one .",
    "this happens to the electron with highest energy among those with spin - down ( when @xmath58 ) .",
    "when the state @xmath58 turns into @xmath54 a discontinuous change in energy splitting of the single electrons states takes place , as the total nonzero magnetization appears in the system .",
    "the total decrease in energy for spin - up electrons exceeds the rise in energy for spin - down electrons .",
    "when @xmath25 reaches the value of approximately 0.43 , further transition from @xmath56 to @xmath57 occurs .",
    "its mechanism is analogous to the previous transition ; again , the spin - down electron with highest energy skips to the state with spin - up .",
    "therefore , the observed kind of behaviour is owing to single energy states and their behaviour in magnetic field .",
    "let us remind that our system of interest is molecular - like and possesses a discrete set of energy states .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) presents the dependence of single particle energy states on electric field at constant magnetic field @xmath70 . here",
    ", energies of both spin - up and spin - down states indicate the same sign of slope in the field .",
    "this time the zeeman splitting does not depend on @xmath20 field unless total spin is changed , since the magnetic field is constant . in a way similar to the previous case , transitions between @xmath58 and @xmath56 ( at @xmath75 ) or between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( at @xmath76 ) consist in skipping of single electrons from spin - down to spin - up states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) we plot again the dependence of single particle energy states on electric field , but this time at zero magnetic field . below the field of approximately @xmath77 ,",
    "the states are spin - degenerate and the total spin of the nanostructure is equal to zero . however , in the range of @xmath78 , the spin degeneracy is lifted and zeeman splitting arises , even though the total spin remains zero .",
    "this phenomenon is related with emergence of antiferromagnetic polarization of the nanoflake , as it can be seen in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) , where spin distribution is shown for @xmath79 .",
    "as it can be noticed , this kind of antiferromagnetic polarization breaks the rotational symmetry of the nanoflake .",
    "it is seen that the zeeman splitting of the energy states is a continuous function of the field ( so that the antiferromagnetic polarization emerges continuously , contrary to ferromagnetic phase ) .",
    "let us remark that the appearance of antiferromagnetic states for the nanoflakes being short sections of armchair nanoribbon with zigzag terminations will be discussed in details in further part of this section .",
    "we mention that a similar phenomenon of appearance of magnetic polarization in a nanoflake under the influence of external electric field has been discussed by us in the ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of controlling the indirect magnetic coupling mediated by the graphene nanostructure ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] it has been shown that single - particle energies exhibit discontinuous behaviour as a function of field , since they vary in piecewise - continuous and quasi - linear way . however",
    ", this is not the case for the total energy of the systems of charge carriers , which remains a strictly continuous function of external electric and magnetic field .",
    "such a property is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fignew ] , in which total energy is plotted as a function of electric field for a charge - neutral triangular nanoflake with armchair edges with @xmath49 in magnetic field of @xmath70 .",
    "the dependence is quasi - linear with slowly decreasing slope .",
    "this slope , i.e. the derivative of total energy with respect to electric field is shown in the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : fignew ] . for this quantity",
    "discontinuous behaviour is visible , with abrupt changes of derivative value at certain critical electric fields , which correspond to transitions between states with different total spin ( the value of which is indicated in the plot ) .",
    "this behaviour can be compared with the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) and it is also consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) .",
    "such an observation confirms that we deal with discontinuous , first - order phase transitions . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of total energy on electric field has been also studied for the case when antiferromagnetic ordering emerges ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) ) .",
    "in such a case , not only the total energy is continuous , but also its first derivative indicates this feature .",
    "it is the second derivative of the total energy which exhibits discontinuities at the critical fields where antiferromagnetic ordering emerges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) ) , what indicates that such phase transitions are of second order ( continuous ) .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) we present the ground state phase diagram for a charge - undoped armchair triangular nanoflake with @xmath80 hexagons at the edge . like for @xmath49 , the state with @xmath58 remains robust against magnetic field for low electric field .",
    "however , at zero ( or low enough ) magnetic field , application of electric field causes a series of transitions between states with @xmath58 and @xmath56 ( with relatively low critical values of @xmath20 ) . if @xmath25 exceeds approximately 0.15 , the phase with @xmath58 vanishes in the intermediate range of electric fields , remaining only at very low or at high @xmath20 . at the same time",
    "states with higher spins ( @xmath57 and @xmath81 ) appear , in particular for low but non - zero @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath82 , also an electric field - induced state with spin @xmath83 appears . the phase diagram is richer in comparison with the case of smaller nanostructure with @xmath49 ; moreover , the electric field - driven magnetic polarization at zero magnetic field is possible for @xmath80 .",
    "also states with higher spin appear , in general , for lower values of @xmath55 then previously and the total area of nonmagnetic phase is reduced . on the contrary , the area of stability of @xmath56 phase is greatly expanded .    in order to analyse the effect of weak charge - doping on the phase diagram , we present fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](b ) and ( c ) , where the same nanostructure is considered , but doped with a single charge carrier ( hole or electron ) . for both signs of doping , the transitions from low - spin to higher spin states become possible only if @xmath55 exceeds some low critical value , so in complete absence of magnetic field @xmath20 can not increase the magnetic moment . from comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) and ( c ) it is seen that for electron doping ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig4](b ) ) .",
    "let us observe that for @xmath67 the situation is quite the opposite .",
    "however , both phase diagrams bear more qualitative similarity than it was noticeable for smaller nanoflake with @xmath49 .    a similar ground - state phase diagram as for triangular nanoflakes is also calculated for the case of undoped nanostructures in a form of an ultrashort piece of armchair graphene nanoribbon with zigzag terminations ( see fig .

    "the diagram is far more complicated for wider nanostructure , with @xmath87 and @xmath85 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) . for zero fields",
    "the nanoflake is non - magnetic , but switching on electric field causes the switching to @xmath56 state for some narrow ranges of moderate @xmath20 for low @xmath55 , including in particular the zero value .",

    "also states with higher spins appear successively at moderate @xmath20 for stronger magnetic field and this happens for lower @xmath55 than in the case of a narrower nanostructure .",

    "it is visible that at zero @xmath20 field , the nanostructure remains in nonmagnetic state up to approximately @xmath111 , while further increase of the field causes a sequence of metamagnetic transitions , leading quite quickly to saturation .",
    "such a behaviour has been also predicted in one of our earlier works @xcite for bowtie - shaped nanostructure ( without electric field ) .",
    "switching on electric field ( cases of @xmath108 and @xmath107 ) causes two effects .",
    "first , the magnetization process at low magnetic fields becomes faster , i.e. the transitions to higher spin states start at lower @xmath63 .",
    "secondly , at higher magnetic fields ( what means approximately @xmath112 ) , the magnetization progress is slower , so that higher field is necessary to reach the saturation .",
    "therefore , in presence of external electric field the shape of dependence of total spin on magnetic field is changed significantly . for low field",
    ", @xmath113 causes the magnetic polarization of the flake at zero magnetic field , as discussed before . in order to assess the importance of charge doping we plot an analogous dependence in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](a ) for the same nanostructure doped with a single hole ( @xmath59 ) and undoped ( @xmath52 ) in presence of electric field @xmath108 .",
    "it is visible that the effect of doping on the magnetization process is , in general , not significant .",
    "however , let us mention that the state at zero magnetic field corresponds then to @xmath62 and also the saturation magnetization is reduced with respect to the undoped case .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](b ) presents similar calculations for an undoped short section of armchair nanoribbon with zigzag terminations ( @xmath87 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "the qualitative shape of the magnetization curve and the effect of electric field on it bears much similarity to the previous case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](a ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath20 field causes faster increase in total spin for low magnetic fields and , on the other hand , delays the saturation . in the inset to this figure , magnetization curves for the structure doped with a single hole ( @xmath59 ) is compared with the case of charge neutrality in absence of electric field .",
    "again , only a slight influence of charge doping is found .",
    "in the paper we have studied the mean field ground - state phase diagram for two classes of graphene nanostructures with armchair edges .",
    "the selected shapes were : triangular nanoflakes with armchair edges and short fragments of armchair graphene nanoribbons with zigzag terminations .",
    "the study was aimed at characterizing the influence of in - plane external electric and magnetic field on the total spin as well as the spin distribution in the nanoflakes .",
    "the total energy of the system of the charge carriers was calculated in a self - consistent way for the tight - binding model hamiltonian supplemented with hubbard term in mfa as well as terms accounting for external fields .    due to the edge form and equal number of carbon atoms in both sublattices",
    ", the charge - neutral structures do not exhibit nonzero spin polarization in absence of external fields .",
    "however , both electric and magnetic field has been found in general to enable switching to states with nonzero total spin .",
    "we noticed that the complexity level of the phase diagram increases significantly with the size of the studied nanostructure ( for both shapes of interest in the present study ) .",
    "the states with @xmath56 appear dominantly for moderate electric fields ( within the studied range ) for weaker magnetic fields and the increase in magnetic field caused further states with @xmath114 to emerge .",
    "however , higher electric fields cause rather nonmagnetic state ( or state with @xmath56 at higher magnetic fields ) to become the the most energetically favourable .",
    "let us observe that a tendency to demagnetization under the action of electric field has been noticed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite for bowtie - shaped nanoflakes , in ref .",
    "@xcite for triangular ones or in ref .",
    "@xcite for various nanorings .",
    "the magnetic polarization can emerge at zero magnetic and critical electric field for larger studied structures , while for smaller ones some critical magnetic field is necessary to enable emergence of spin via electric field .",
    "the predicted metamagnetic transitions in the investigated nanostructures emerge as a result of behaviour of single , discrete energy states in external field .",
    "the influence of weak charge doping on the magnetic phase diagram has been also illustrated for the case of triangular nanoflakes with armchair edge .",
    "significant differences between electron- and hole - doping ( with a single charge carrier ) were observed , in particular for the smallest nanoflake studied ( hole doping promoted the states with higher spins for wider range of fields than electron doping ) .    for nanoflakes being short pieces of armchair graphene nanoribbon ,",
    "the phase diagram was enriched by finding the antiferromagnetic phases within the range of @xmath58 .",
    "all such phases , stable only in weak magnetic field and nonzero electric field , were characterized by good spatial separation of spin density ranges with opposite spin orientation . moreover ,",
    "the metamagnetic transitions between @xmath58 antiferromagnetic and non - magnetic state are only possible by varying the electric field , not the magnetic field ( which can enforce the state with @xmath54 ) .    the process of magnetization of the nanoflake with magnetic field at constant electric field has been also characterized .",
    "electric field has been found to shift the magnetic saturation towards higher magnetic fields , while , on the other hand , it promoted faster magnetization at weaker magnetic fields .",
    "we are convinced that our work can inspire further research focused on exploring the phase diagrams of graphene nanostructures in both electric and magnetic field , for which the mfa results provide a reference point .",
    "in particular , since the magnetic field can originate from the ferromagnetic substrate , it can be of importance for prediction of behaviour of graphene nanostructures placed on such substrate in external electric field .",
