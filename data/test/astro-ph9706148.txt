    "the most advanced results based on the physical picture are those obtained in the opal project ( rogers et al .",
    "however , as an intrinsic limitation of the formalism , they are restricted to low densities and/or high temperatures .",

    "1977 , hereafter lao ) .",
    "however , this approach fails at intermediate densities and relatively low temperatures ( see , e.g. , van riper 1988 ) , where it leads to unrealistic eos owing to too large values of the coulomb correction . in the afore - mentioned density region ,",
    "the less dense and more strongly correlated electron gas is polarized by the external ionic field and eventually the electrons become bound by pressure recombination .",

    "the extrapolated values of @xmath19 have practically no effect on temperature profiles , because at high densities the heat transport is provided by electrons ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "previous studies of the temperature profiles in ns envelopes have mainly used the electron thermal conductivity of completely ionized , strongly degenerate plasma . in particular",

    "third , in the solid regime , we have used the new expression for the electron thermal conductivity , derived recently by baiko & yakovlev ( 1995 ) . note that at temperatures much lower than the melting temperatures , the coulomb scattering of electrons by charged impurities may become important ( e.g. , yu ) .",
    "it depends on the impurity charge and , most important , on its number density @xmath115 which is generally unknown in the ns envelopes .",

    "let us assume that an accreted envelope consists of shells with different chemical compositions .",
    "for an accretion of h / he , it is reasonable to expect that the outermost accreted layers are built of pure h , owing to the strong gravitational stratification ( alcock & illarionov 1980 ) , whereas he may exist in the deeper layers .",
    "the accretion is accompanied by the nuclear transformations of h / he into heavier elements .",
    "the details of these transformations are still uncertain , and we consider several models of accreted envelopes .    as a first example",
    ", we take the typical temperatures and densities of the nuclear burning from ergma ( 1986 ) and assume the burning to be non - explosive . if @xmath0 is high and the accreted hydrogen layer reaches the region with @xmath185  k , then h burns efficiently into he in the thermonuclear regime . if temperature is lower and the hydrogen layer reaches the density @xmath186 g @xmath7 , a pycnonuclear burning of h into he proceeds . at higher @xmath187 g @xmath7 and/or @xmath188  k , helium burns into carbon ( schramm et al .",

    "one can observe significant differences from the thermal structure of a non - accreted fe envelope , as explained below .",
    "for a not too cold ns ( @xmath194  k ) , the main temperature gradient occurs in a layer of degenerate electron gas with ions in the liquid state , where the thermal conduction is mostly provided by the electrons due to the electron - ion collisions .",
    "the heavier the element , the smaller the thermal conductivity , and the steeper is the temperature growth inside the star . however , with decreasing @xmath0 , the width of the heat  insulating degenerate layer becomes smaller , and the effect is less pronounced . in a cooler ns ( @xmath195  k ) , the main temperature gradient shifts into the ns atmosphere ( to the optical depths @xmath196 ) . for heavier elements ,",
    "the atmospheric layers appear generally denser ( at the same @xmath0 , see fig .",

    "for example , the densities of nuclear h and he burning presented by iben ( 1974 ) ( see also kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) are much lower than those given by ergma ( 1986 ) .",
    "we have significantly shifted the interfaces according to the results of iben ( 1974 ) , but the @xmath0@xmath5 relationship remains practically unchanged .",
    "we have also calculated the temperature profiles for a purely helium ns envelope .",
    "these profiles are slightly different from those in a burning accreted matter described above .",
    "however , the @xmath0@xmath5 relationships remain practically the same .",
    "recently the thermal structure of old , slowly accreting nss has been examined in several articles ( see miralda - escud et al .",

    "the internal stellar temperature is assumed to be determined by the accretion rate .",

    "accordingly , we have recalculated the temperature profiles replacing @xmath198c by @xmath117fe or @xmath200o and found only very small differences .",
    "the insensitivity of the temperature profiles to the composition of the innermost layers of the envelope is quite natural , because these layers are nearly isothermal .    summarizing the above discussion",
    "we can conclude that the @xmath0@xmath5 relationship is remarkably insensitive to the parameters of nuclear burning and to the chemical composition of accreted matter ( h and/or he ) but differs from the one in a non - accreted ns .",
    "this conclusion will not change if h burning is explosive ( see , e.g. , paczyski 1983 , miralda - escud et al .",
    "1990 ) . during an outburst , the h - shell burns into he , without any noticeable effect on the @xmath0@xmath5 relation .",
    "according to miralda - escud et al .",
    "( 1990 ) helium burning in slowly accreting nss is unstable ; it produces nuclear outbursts with burning of all accreted material .",

    "the accretion can occur , for instance , at the post - supernova stage ( e.g. , chevalier 1989 , 1996 , brown & weingartner 1994 ) especially if the pulsar activity is suppressed initially by burying the pulsar magnetic field under the fallen - back matter ( muslimov & page 1995 ) .",
    "we show the standard and rapid neutrino cooling for different amount of accreted mass @xmath204 .",
    "the fraction of accreted mass @xmath216 varies from 0 ( non - accreted nss ) to @xmath9 ( fully accreted ns envelope ) .",
    "it is evident that further increase of @xmath204 does not affect the cooling .",
    "the change of slopes of the cooling curves at @xmath217@xmath218 yrs reflects the change of the cooling regime .",
    "initially , a ns is at the neutrino cooling stage .",
    "it cools mainly via the neutrino emission ; the internal stellar temperature is ruled by this emission and is thus independent of the thermal insulation of the ns envelope .",
    "the surface photon emission is determined by the @xmath5@xmath0 relation . since the accreted envelopes of not too cold nss are more thermally transparent ( sect .",
    "[ sect - accr ] ) , the surface temperature of an accreted ns is noticeably higher than that of a non - accreted ns .",
    "one can see that even a very small fraction of accreted matter , such as @xmath219 , may change appreciably the thermal history of the star .",
    "the colder the star , the smaller is the fraction of accreted material which yields the same cooling curve as the fully accreted ns envelope . the effect is naturally more pronounced for the rapid cooling ( for colder nss ) .    if @xmath220@xmath218 yrs , the neutrino luminosity decreases , and the ns cools mainly via the surface emission of photons ( the photon cooling stage ) .",
    "since the envelopes of the accreting ( and not too cold ) nss have lower thermal insulation , these stars cool now faster than the non - accreted ones ( fig .",
