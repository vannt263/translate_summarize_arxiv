    "it has been suggested that the most massive planets in a planetary system can be formed by a process of gas collapse , independently of metallicity , whilst the lighter components would have formed via core accretion .",
    "this can lead to a situation in which massive planets that have originated relatively far away from the inner system , migrate inwards into it ( see * ? ? ? * and contribution by font - ribera et al . in this same volume ) . in this process ,",
    "these more massive planets with larger semi - major axis , cross the gas disc centred around the central sun .",
    "when going through this dissipative process , the planets lose kinetic energy because of the friction with the gas . as a consequence ,",
    "the inner disc is heated up and the semi - major axis of the planet shrinks .",
    "after some passages , the planet is trapped in the disc with a residual eccentricity .",
    "we propose this scenario as a plausible way of explaining the existence of massive planets distributed around a sun with non - zero eccentricities .",
    "we give results based on high - accurate dynamical simulations about the distribution of the orbital elements of the trapped objects in the disc .",
    "we find that the massive planets are typically captured after some @xmath0 yrs and the final eccentricity is non - negligible ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have recently developed an integrator bhint specialised for dynamical processes in the vicinity of a very massive particle , which relies in the assumption that the very massive particle dominates the motion of the smaller ones @xcite .",
    "for this new mechanism , we retain the hermite scheme as a basis .",
    "the bottleneck is , of course , the number of particles to be used .",
    "nonetheless , we resort to special - purpose hardware , the grape , a card specially developed to integrate the calculation of newtonian gravitational forces .",
    "the peak performance of one of these cards is of 130 gflop , roughly equivalent to 100 single pcs , which makes possible long simulations with a realistic particle number .",
    "we set initially a disc made out of @xmath2 small particles which is `` hosting '' a sun in the centre and follows a simple @xmath3 profile .",
    "the integrated mass is of some 5 jupiters and the radius of some @xmath4 au .",
    "the thickness of the disc is of about the diameter of the central sun and has a gap around the central sun which extends @xmath5 au .",
    "the mass of the central sun is @xmath6 .",
    "the mass forming the disc are all single - mass .",
    "the massive planet , a massive particle of 5 jupiters is set in an orbit such that the initial eccentricity with the sun is of @xmath7 .",
    "initially , the particle is 100 au away from the sun and the inclination angle is @xmath8 degrees .",
    "the system ( disc plus interloper ) is integrated until the interloper is trapped by the disc . in the figure",
    "we show the evolution of the orbital parameters . whilst we can not discuss them in detail because of the publication limits",
    ", we note that after some @xmath9 yrs the inclination has almost not changed as compared to its initial value .",
    "then , after a short time of @xmath10 yrs elapses , it abruptly decays from almost 80 degrees to a very small number , to be finally trapped in the disc after @xmath11 yrs .",
    "the energy , whilst it decays from the initial high value of 0.95 , is of @xmath1 when the massive planet is totally trapped in the disc , within a final semi - major axis which is well within the range of expectation .",
    "an extended and detailed scrutiny of the parameter space of this capture process we propose will be soon published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the adressing of this scenario has direct bearing on our understanding of planetary dynamics and migration mechanisms ."
