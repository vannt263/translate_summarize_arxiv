    "general theories of open quantum dynamics as introduced in @xcite provide the mathematical pathway to the characterization of real - world quantum mechanical systems , subject to dissipation and dephasing by environmental interactions . such effects are crucial across a multitude of fields ranging from solid - state to chemical physics , quantum optics , and mesoscopic physics .    in the context of a classical environment , linear dissipation can be modeled by the caldeira - leggett oscillator approach @xcite , closely linked to langevin equations @xcite which offer a concise formalism based on retarded friction kernels and gaussian random forces ( thermal noise ) . the quantum analogue of friction ,",
    "however , needs a much more subtle treatment since it typically creates substantial correlations between system and environment . moreover , quantum fluctuations of a thermal reservoir are non - zero at any temperature , leading to interesting phenomena and non - trivial ground states .    within the quantum regime the dynamical properties of the reduced density matrix are paramount . by tracing out reservoir degrees of freedom from the global dynamics ,",
    "the focus is narrowed towards a relevant subsystem .",
    "any systematic treatment of dynamical features like decoherence of quantum states , dissipation of energy , relaxation to equilibrium or non - equilibrium steady states requires a consistent procedure to distill a dynamical map or an equation of motion for the reduced density matrix from the unitary evolution of system and reservoir .",
    "the markovian approximation typically generalizes the classical probabilistic technique of a dynamical semigroup in analogy to the differential chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "the finite - dimensional mathematical framework of quantum dynamical semigroups traces back to the seminal work by gorini , kossakowski , sudarshan @xcite and simultaneously by lindblad @xcite .",
    "while the resulting quantum master equations of lindblad form provide an easy - to - use set of tools for many applications , their perturbative nature fails in the presence of strong environment coupling , long correlation time scales or entanglement in the initial state .",
    "the degree of non - markovianity which is inherent to the density matrix evolution and which causes pronounced retardation effects in reservoir - mediated self - interactions constitutes an active field of research @xcite . whereas considerable advances have been made in the characterization of dynamical generators as non - markovian @xcite , much less attention",
    "is paid to the question of how non - markovian behavior arises from the hamiltonian description of a system - reservoir model .    beyond perturbative dynamics of memoryless master equations and related strategies",
    "like quantum jumps @xcite or quantum state diffusion @xcite , a pool of numerically exact simulation methods has been developed , each with specific strengths and specific weaknesses .",
    "one can distinguish between methods set - up in the full hilbert space of system and bath degrees of freedom and those considering the dynamics of the reduced density operator of the system alone .",
    "the former include approaches based on e.g.  the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite , the multiconfiguration hartree ( mctdh ) @xcite , and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "the latter can all be derived from the path integral formulation pioneered by feynman and vernon @xcite .",
    "they treat the functional integration either directly such as the path integral quantum monte carlo ( pimc ) @xcite and the quasi - adiabatic propagator ( quapi ) @xcite or cast it in some form of time evolution equations .",
    "this is by no means straightforward due to the bath induced time retardation , a problem that always appears at lower temperatures .",
    "equivalence to the path integral expression is then only guaranteed for a nested hierarchy of those equations @xcite or time evolution equations carrying stochastic forces @xcite from which the reduced density follows after a proper averaging .",
    "these stochastic approaches exploit the intimate connection between the description of a quantum reservoir in terms of an influence functional and stochastic processes .",
    "in fact , influence functionals do not only arise when a partial trace is taken over environmental degrees of freedom , they are also representations of random forces sampled from a classical probability space @xcite",
    ". this stochastic construction can be reversed , leading to an unraveling of quantum mechanical influence functionals into time - local stochastic action terms @xcite ; we thus obtain the dynamics of the reduced system through statistical averaging of random state samples generated by numerically solving a single time - local stochastic liouville - von neumann equation ( sln @xcite ) .",
    "compared to other methods this provides a very transparent formulation of non - makrovian quantum dynamics with the particular benefit that the consistent inclusion of external time dependent fields is straightforward @xcite .",
    "since the random forces resulting from the exact mapping of the quantum reservoir to a probability space are not purely real , the resulting stochastic propagation is non - unitary .",
    "therefore , the signal - to - noise ratio of empirical statistics based on sln propagation deteriorates for long - time .",
    "this issue is reminiscent of the sign problem in real - time path integrals @xcite and represents a major hurdle in solving the most general c - number noise stochastic liouville - von neumann equation for time intervals much longer than the timescales of relaxation and dephasing .",
    "here we modify a strategy , recently presented by one of us @xcite , which uses a projection operator @xcite based finite - memory scheme to solve the complex - noise sln numerically .",
    "finite - memory stochastic propagation ( fmsp ) significantly lowers the effect of statistical fluctuations and leads to a much faster convergence of long - time sample trajectories , with a gain in computational efficiency by several orders of magnitude .",
    "while the relevant memory timescales used before were reservoir correlation times @xcite , we use a different projector here , adapted to the case of finite dephasing times .",
    "if either the dissipative coupling or the reservoir temperature exceed certain thresholds , this results in a shorter memory time and better statistics .",
    "we apply this framework to two- and three - level systems and compare numerical data with perturbative predictions .",
    "particular emphasis is put on the transition from coherent to incoherent population dynamics .",
    "since the new method allows for converged simulations also in the long time domain , transfer rates for sequential hopping and super - exchange @xcite can be extracted which are of relevance for charge or energy transfer in molecular aggregates and arrays of artificial atoms , e.g. quantum dot structures .",
