    "luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs , @xmath3 , @xmath4  mpc@xmath5 ) , are the dominant population among objects with @xmath6 in the local universe ( see the comprehensive review by sanders & mirabel 1996 , also for a definition of @xmath0 ) .",
    "most ligs are merging / interacting ( , sanders 1992 ; leech 1994 ; murphy 1996 ) and molecular gas rich with a high star formation ( sf ) rate as most of the luminosity is radiated by dust in the far - ir .",
    "sanders ( 1988 ) suggested that the most extreme ultra - ligs ( uligs ) with @xmath7 comparable with the bolometric luminosity of quasars ( qsos ) , are dust - enshrouded qsos triggered by the interaction / merger of two _ gas - rich _ spirals .",
    "however , a starburst origin ( , joseph & wright 1985 ) even for uligs has also been suggested .",
    "evidence in favor of a starburst includes the h@xmath1 gas content , radio continuum morphology and iso mid - ir spectroscopy ( , solomon 1997 ( s97 ) ; downes & solomon 1998 ( ds98 ) ; condon 1991 ; genzel 1998 ) .",
    "the observed abundant supply of _ dense _ h@xmath1 gas traced by hcn emission , usually found only in sf cores ( solomon 1992 ; gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 1999 ) shows that uligs are ideal stellar nurseries .",
    "although there have been extensive co observations in ligs / uligs including co imaging ( , scoville 1991 ; 1997 ; ds98 ) , there has been no systematic attempt to trace the h@xmath1 gas properties during the galaxy - galaxy merger sequence starting with systems roughly separated by a galactic diameter .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the connection between the progress of a merger and the h@xmath1 gas responsible for the sf .",
    "there are many close mergers where the progenitors are not gas - rich galaxies ; these may never become ligs .",
    "all ligs / uligs are h@xmath1 gas rich ( sanders 1991 ; gao 1996 ; s97 ) .",
    "the ideal sample to trace a merger sequence should contain galaxies of various merging stages that initially started with roughly comparable molecular gas content . since this is impossible , we select ligs where we can identify the 2 progenitors from ccd images usually in the red or near - ir . by measuring the co(1 - 0 ) luminosity as a function of the merger separation , the time dependence of the gas content can be traced statistically .",
    "we focus exclusively on mergers satisfying @xmath8 ,   where @xmath9 is the projected separation between the nuclei of the merging galaxies of the major diameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in reality",
    ", we require the pairs have touching / overlapping optical disks / tails .",
    "we exclude late mergers of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 kpc at an angular distance of @xmath14 mpc ) so that @xmath9 can be reliably measured .",
    "this also helps to distinguish genuine mergers from projection effects , exclude galaxies where there is confusion of the extranuclear starburst regions with galactic nuclei , and minimize other potential biases introduced by the seeing limit or severe dust obscuration . at larger distance , ligs with @xmath15  kpc similar to the nearest uligs arp  220 , mrk  273 will be simply indistinguishable from the single - nucleus galaxies without sub - arcsec imaging . even at moderate distances ( @xmath16 mpc ) , some previously accepted close doubles , , mrk  231 ( armus 1994 ) and iras  12112 + 0305 ( sanders 1992 ) turn out to be singles as seen by hst ( surace 1998 ; sanders 1998 , private communications ) .",
    "our sample selection is simple : all ligs with   @xmath17   are selected if they have both co data and ccd images .",
    "a heterogeneous sample of 50 ligs has been used ( table  1 ) ; 19 of them are uligs .",
    "co(1 - 0 ) observations have been conducted in @xmath18 ligs of mostly mergers ( gao 1996 ) .",
    "most have been observed with the nrao 12 m and a representation is shown in fig .  1 ( details will be discussed in a future paper ) .",
    "this nearly completes the co data for nearby lig mergers in the bright galaxy sample ( bgs , soifer 1989 ; sanders 1995 ) .",
    "a _ volume - limited _",
    "( @xmath19 ) nearly complete sample of 20 ligs , mainly from the bgs , is highlighted in table  1 .",
    "most ligs but not uligs are in this sub - sample .",
    "we have separated the sample into 31 ligs with @xmath21 and 19 uligs with @xmath22 .",
    "the observed co luminosities range over an order of magnitude @xmath239.210.3 , @xmath24=k pc@xmath25 for the entire sample .",
    "this is at the high end of the distribution for normal molecular gas - rich galaxies .",
    "however for uligs the range is smaller with @xmath26 ( s97 ) .",
    "the correlation between co luminosity @xmath20 and the nuclei separation @xmath9 is evident in * fig .",
    "2a*. we compute correlation coefficients of @xmath27 for 31 ligs , and @xmath28 for 20 _",
    "volume - limited _ ligs , with fits : @xmath29 respectively .",
    "clearly , this correlation indicates @xmath20 is decreasing as merging progresses to advanced stages .",
    "the system with the highest @xmath20 in the sample is arp  302 which also has the largest separation .",
    "even if arp  302 is excluded the correlation remains the same . while the correlation for the entire heterogeneous sample is still obvious ( @xmath30 ) the correlation for uligs alone ( open circles in fig .",
    "2 ) is not significant ( @xmath31 ) . in view of the near constancy of  for uligs ( s97 )",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "there is no correlation between ir luminosity  and separation @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "2b ) indicating the ir emission is not enhanced as the merger progresses , at least prior to reaching @xmath32 kpc . as discussed above",
    "we have excluded close mergers / singles .",
    "many of these are uligs .",
    "an anti - correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath9 appears to hold if small separation uligs are included , particularly 10 uligs in the bgs ( sanders 1988 ) .",
    "there is a significant anti - correlation between @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 , a sf `` efficiency '' ( sfe ) measure of the global sf rate per solar mass of gas ) and @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "2c , @xmath35 for 31 ligs ) . here",
    "we have used a standard conversion factor of @xmath36 applicable to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) to obtain h@xmath1 mass from .",
    "it clearly suggests that the sf rate , normalized to the available molecular mass , or sfe , increases at small separations .",
    "this indicates an increased rate for the conversion of gas to stars , which is the primary criterion for a starburst .",
    "we checked for possible selection effects by examining the dependence of the parameters on distance to the source .",
    "there is no strong dependence of the projected separation upon the distance even in the large heterogeneous sample , the correlation between  and the distance is weak and is nonexistent for the nearby bgs ligs .",
    "we conclude that there is a strong correlation between  and @xmath9 for ligs although almost no correlation for uligs .",
    "co observations of widely separated interacting galaxies ( @xmath37 , * non - mergers * ) show no correlation between  and @xmath9 ( combes 1994 ) .",
    "after merging begins @xmath38 kpc , the molecular gas content is decreasing as merging advances .",
    "since we may overestimate the h@xmath1 mass in uligs and late mergers ( s97 ; ds98 ) by using a constant conversion factor , the dependence of h@xmath1 mass on separation may be even steeper than that in eq .",
    "1 .    mergers separated by a few kpc produce the * same * as mergers with @xmath39  kpc * with less h@xmath1 gas * ( fig .  2 & eq .  1 ) .",
    "it is not the increase in molecular gas that leads to the high  but the increase in average gas surface density which produces a higher sfe . in more than a dozen early / intermediate stage mergers in this sample",
    ", co imaging reveals that most of the gas is in the inner merging disks except for widely separated pairs not yet closely interacting , which have extended co ( gao 1997 ; 1998a ; lo , gao & gruendl 1997 ) .",
    "arp  302 ( lo 1997 ) , the widest pair ( @xmath9=25  kpc ) , has two extended co disks ( @xmath40 kpc ) and one of them shows roughly an exponential disk with a scale length of @xmath41 kpc extending out to 20 kpc in diameter .",
    "ngc  6670 ( @xmath42 kpc ) shows central sources with @xmath43 kpc radii and strong co disks out to @xmath44 kpc with weaker emission out to 15 kpc in both galaxies .",
    "arp  238 ( @xmath9=12  kpc ) and arp  55 ( @xmath9=10  kpc ) , the intermediate stage mergers , show central @xmath132 kpc sources and extensions out to @xmath4410 kpc in both pairs of disks .",
    "late mergers like arp  299 ( aalto 1997 ) and ngc  6090 ( @xmath45 kpc ) show gas concentrations between the merging disks .    for a pair of gas - rich spirals initially separated at @xmath46 kpc , merging at ( orbital decay speed ) @xmath47 , the time to reach @xmath48 is   @xmath49 myr . if the ligs with different separations are interpreted as a sequence then , using a standard conversion factor and eq .  1 , the implied average sf ( gas depletion ) rate is @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "of course , the trend evident in fig .",
    "2a may not be a true time sequence since it is a snapshot of many ligs at various separations .",
    "nevertheless , this sf rate deduced from the observed depletion of h@xmath1 gas is similar to that inferred from @xmath0 ( under the assumption that the ir luminosity is from imbedded high mass stars ) : about 100 /yr for @xmath52 ( , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .    at the extreme end of the merger sequence",
    "are ultra - ligs ( uligs ) with small separations or no evidence of 2 remaining nuclei , which have very compact gas concentrations and about 5 times more  than ligs .",
    "most of the molecular gas in uligs is concentrated in the central 1 kpc and is not in normal gmcs ; the translation of  to h@xmath1 mass is fundamentally different ( s97 ; ds98 ) and the h@xmath1 mass is lower than expected from use of a standard coversion factor .",
    "nevertheless , uligs still have close to @xmath53 h@xmath1 . even allowing for this , uligs",
    "do not follow the correlations we find for ligs ( fig .  2 )",
    ". the difference may be due to the different physical parameters of the starbursts .",
    "the starbursts in uligs appear to take place predominantly in * extreme starburst * regions of @xmath16 pc size and @xmath54 ( ds98 ) with substantial velocity structure characterized by rotation or bar - like motion .",
    "they are the primary sources of the millimeter continuum with more than 1,000 magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "for example , arp 220 has two extreme starburst regions",
    ". these may be the remnants of nuclei or condensations in the gas but they now are composed almost entirely of gas and young stars .",
    "agns might also contribute to  in some uligs ( , veilleux 1997 ) .    mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) have predicted the sf rate and the gas depletion during a merger sequence in two extreme cases : galaxies with bulges and without ( see their fig .",
    "the decrease in h@xmath1 mass in our sample ( fig .",
    "2a ) is consistent with their model prediction ( especially when uligs are excluded ) for a diverse group of initial conditions and bulge / disk ratios . in the models only mergers with bulges have enough gas left for a final extreme burst as in uligs .",
    "the models failed to predict gas concentration in the overlap region , either hi in early mergers , , ngc  6670 ( wang 1998 ) or h@xmath1 in intermediate mergers , , arp  244 and arp  299 ( gao 1998b ; aalto 1997 ) . although gas inflow into the center in late mergers is predicted ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) , this is near the final merging ( @xmath55 3 kpc ) .",
    "successful models should distinguish between diffuse hi and h@xmath1 in gmcs and produce this feature when galaxies are still 515 kpc apart .",
    "sf in the overlap region is predicted in a model by the compression of pre - existing gmcs due to the heating of the atomic ism by shocks ( jog & solomon 1992 ) .",
    "pre - existing gmcs are clearly the source of sf even before the true merging of the disks as is evident in arp  302 .",
    "we show here that there is a strong correlation between co luminosity , a measure of m(h@xmath1 ) , and the projected separation for luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) .",
    "although there is no correlation between the star formation ( sf ) rate ( ) and separation , ligs with smaller separation have a higher sf rate per solar mass of h@xmath1 .",
    "this increase in sf `` efficiency '' is due to increased h@xmath1 gas surface density .",
    "advanced mergers have * less * h@xmath1 mass ( not more ) than when the mergers started .",
    "this implies that the starburst is not fueled by a large inflow of a huge mass of diffuse hi gas from large galactic radii converting to h@xmath1 , but rather that existing gmcs form stars throughout the merging process over a few hundred million years .",
    "although the correlations are robust for ligs they do not exist for ultra - ligs ( uligs ) .",
    "the difference may be due to the different physical parameters and timescales of the starbursts .",
    "the starbursts in uligs appear to take place predominantly in * extreme starburst * regions with radii @xmath14 pc , @xmath56 h@xmath1 , @xmath54 and a very high sf efficiency ( ds98 ) .",
    "the dynamical timescales in extreme starbursts are characterized by only about a million years ( @xmath57 and size @xmath16 pc ) .",
