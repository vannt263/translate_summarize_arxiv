    ".3 cm    quaternions are one of the simplest examples of a non - commutative associative algebra .",
    "when pure imaginary qua - ternions are used to represent 3d vectors , the adjoint action of the group of unit quaternions upon them provides a representation of all 3d rotations . because of this , quaternions have important applications in 3d euclidean computing @xcite",
    ".    in symbolic geometric computing , when geometric entities and their transformations are represented by coordinate - free symbols , algebraic manipulations among the symbols often lead to rather simple and geometrically interpretable results @xcite .",
    "for example , using @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 as a vector variable , provides a typical coordinate - free representation of a 3d direction ( or point ) by a pure imaginary quaternion . under the quaternionic product ,",
    "these variables generate a ring of non - commutative polynomials .",
    "it is natural to ask for symbolic algebraic algorithms to manipulate such _",
    "quaternionic polynomials_.    when the coefficients of the quaternionic polynomials are taken in the field of rational numbers @xmath2 , the quaternionic product , being associative and multilinear , must be a quotient of the @xmath2-tensor product modulo an ideal @xmath3 whose generators are some tensors .",
    "finding such generators and proving that they are sufficient to define the quaternionic product is the first task to finish .",
    "the first theorem in this paper provides very simple generators of @xmath3 , called the _ syzygy ideal _ of quaternionic polynomials .",
    "the next task is naturally on computing the grbner bases of @xmath3 and then the normal forms of quaternionic polynomials .",
    "this can always be done using the classical theory and algorithm on non - commutative grbner bases @xcite . for a fixed number @xmath4 of quaternionic variables",
    ", one can compute a grbner base of the syzygy ideal @xmath5 in the @xmath4 variables , and for every degree @xmath6 , the number of degree-@xmath6 polynomials in the computed grbner base is finite . after investigating the elements in the grbner bases for small values of @xmath4 and @xmath6",
    ", we come up with some observations on the general form of the grbner base for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath6 , and of the normal forms of quaternionic polynomials with respect to the grbner base .",
    "the main part of this paper is the establishment of two theorems that provide explicitly ( 1 ) a reduced grbner base of the syzygy ideal @xmath5 of quaternionic polynomials in @xmath4 pure imaginary quaternionic variables , ( 2 ) the structure of the normal forms relative to the grbner base .",
    "the results are extremely simple .",
    "for example , each polynomial in the grbner base has either 2 or 4 terms ; the sequence of variables in a monomial of normal form always forms two intertwining non - descending subsequences in terms of the ordering of the variables ( figure [ normal ] and figure [ normal:2 ] of this paper ) .",
    "the proofs of the theorems are very long and are divided into many cases .",
    "we provide detailed proofs for several cases for illustration , but skip the rest by limitation of the size of this paper .",
