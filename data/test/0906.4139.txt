    "the observed cosmic speed up @xcite questions the validity of general relativity ( gr ) on large scales .",
    "in fact , if on one hand the model of gravitational interaction as described by einstein s theory is in agreement with many observational tests on relatively small scales , as solar system and binary pulsars observations show @xcite , it is well known that in order to make gr agree with the observed acceleration of the universe the existence of _ dark energy _ , a cosmic fluid having exotic properties , has been postulated .",
    "actually , many candidates for explaining the nature of dark energy have been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , some of them relying on the modification of the geometrical structure of the theory , some others on the introduction of physically ( up to day ) unknown fluids into the equations governing the behaviour of our universe .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to point out that the problem of explaining the acceleration of the universe has been addressed also in the framework of gr ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this context , we want to consider here a generalization of einstein s theory , the so - called rastall s model @xcite , based on the requirement that the stress - energy tensor for the matter / energy content is not conserved , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "rastall s model has been initially motivated by the need for a theory able to allow a non - conservativity of the source stress - energy tensor without violating the bianchi identities . as such",
    ", the original theory was based on purely phenomenological motivations and directly started with the field equations without any attempt to derive them from a variational principle ( even if there have been subsequent attempts to deduce rastall s field equations from a variational principle , but none of them have succeeded @xcite ) .    as for the confrontation with the data ,",
    "it is interesting to point out that rastall s field equations , in vacuum , are equivalent to gr ones : as a consequence , all classical tests of gr are correctly reproduced . on the other hand , it could be useful to test the cosmological predictions of the theory , by considering the solutions within the cosmological fluid .",
    "our work is motivated by the fact that rastall s theory was introduced more than 30 years ago , so it is interesting to test it against the recent cosmological data . in particular , we focus on the possibility of describing the accelerated expansion of the universe in rastall s framework , by investigating the conditions that the parameters of the theory have to fulfill in order to reproduce the data .",
    "furthemore , prompted by a recent paper @xcite , we check whether the cardassian model @xcite can be derived by rastall s tensorial equations , because , despite the fact that this model passed almost all observational tests , it is purely phenomenological .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we will firstly give an introduction to rastall s model in sect .",
    "[ sec : rastall ] , while the corresponding cosmological scenario and the analogy with the cardassians expansion model is worked out in sect .",
    "[ sec : cardass ] . in order to check the possible viability of the rastall s proposal , we test the model with respect to the sneia and grbs hubble diagram , as detailed in sect . [ sec : data ] .",
    "conclusions are finally presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "in 1972 p. rastall @xcite explored a model in which the stress - energy tensor of the source of the gravitational field , @xmath2 , was not conserved , i.e. the condition @xmath0 is imposed a priori .",
    "indeed , einstein equations , and greek indices run from 0 to 3 . ]",
    "read    g_r_- 1 2 g_r=_gr t _  ,  [ eq : eeq ] where the ricci tensor is obtained from a metric connection , so that @xmath3 and the scalar curvature @xmath4 has to be intended as @xmath5 ; furthermore we have set @xmath6 .",
    "these equations naturally imply the stress - energy tensor conservation as a consequence of the contracted bianchi identities , g^ _ ; = 0  .",
    "[ eq : bianchi ] it is therefore worth wondering whether it is possible to fulfill the requirement @xmath0 without violating eqs.([eq : bianchi ] ) . a possible way out",
    "could be introducing further geometrical terms on the right hand side of einstein equations , even if one should ask whether this makes sense .",
    "actually , if we insist in deriving these relations from a metric variational approach , the sudden answer would be of course negative : in this case the stress - energy tensor would be surely conserved by construction , so no way to escape the conditions @xmath7 .",
    "another remark against the non - conservativity focuses on the equivalence principle : as a matter of fact , the conservation of the stress - energy tensor is tested with high accuracy in the realm of special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "then , one jumps to the realm of gr just invoking the principle of minimal coupling .",
    "however , one has to go easy with such an approach , as this principle could be misleading @xcite . to give an example ,",
    "when passing from gr to sr , we completely miss the information provided by terms explicitly depending on the curvature tensor , @xmath8 , as it becomes identically zero when the spacetime becomes flat .",
    "this means that the two sets of equations    _ j^ = 0 and    _ j^+r^ _ _",
    "j^ ^j^ = 0  , give exactly the same equations , i.e. @xmath9 , in sr .",
    "so , the straightforward application of the equivalence principle in writing conservation laws should be carefully considered .",
    "the question is now how to pick up a proper geometrical term such that the bianchi identities are still valid , but nevertheless the conservation of the stress - energy tensor of the gravity source is violated . to resume",
    ", we ask for a four - vector , say @xmath10 , such that ( i ) @xmath11 ; ( ii ) @xmath12 on curved spacetime , but @xmath13 on flat spacetime in order not to conflict with the validity of sr .",
    "both these properties hold for the rastall s proposal , that is    t^ _ ; = r _ ,  ,  [ eq : rast req ] @xmath14 being a suitable non - null dimensional constant .",
    "because of the assumption ( [ eq : rast req ] ) , the field equations are obviously modified and now read    r_- ( 1 - 2 _ r ) r g _ = _ r t _  , [ eq : rast1 ] where @xmath15 is a dimensional constant to be determined in order to give the right poisson equation in the static weak - field limit .",
    "it is manifest that in vacuum , where @xmath16 , rastall s field equations ( [ eq : rast1 ] ) are equivalent to gr ones .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the same set of equations can be obtained as the result of guesswork , that is assuming the left hand side of the sought after equations to be a symmetric tensor only consisting of terms that are linear in the second derivative and/or quadratic in the first derivatives of the metric @xcite . moreover",
    ", the time - time component of such equations must give the poisson equations back for a stationary weak - field .",
    "accordingly , the only requirement we drop with respect to the derivation of the einstein equations is the one concerning the conservation of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , starting from @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 appropriate constants , we end up with eqs.([eq : rast1 ] ) again , provided that we set :    @xmath20    where we have chosen to rewrite all the other constants in terms of the @xmath18 . note , in particular , that the coupling constant between matter and geometry , @xmath15 , is not the same as in gr , unless @xmath21 , that is @xmath22 ( i.e. , we consistently go back to gr ) .",
    "taking the trace of eqs.([eq : rast1 ] ) gives us the structural or master equation @xcite : ( 4 _ r - 1 ) r = _ r t  .",
    "[ eq : mast rast ] for a traceless stress - energy tensor , @xmath23 ( as for the electromagnetic tensor ) and two possibilities arise .",
    "the first is that @xmath24 so that we get no differences with standard gr . on the other hand",
    ", one could also solve eq.([eq : mast rast ] ) setting @xmath25 , whatever the value of @xmath4 is .",
    "however , inserting this condition in eq.([eq : kappar lambda ] ) , we get a complex value for @xmath26 which is clearly meaningless .",
    "therefore , we hereafter assume that @xmath27 .",
    "another fundamental question concerns geodesic motions . as it is well known , the equations @xmath28 are nothing but the equations of motion of the fluid we are dealing with .",
    "the problem is then , what sort of curves are described in a curved spacetime by a fluid whose stress - energy tensor is not conserved .",
    "following the calculations made by rastall , we find that in his model geodesics are those curves characterized by the fact that the scalar curvature @xmath4 is constant along them .",
    "moreover , it is still possible to speak of conservation of energy for an ideal fluid @xcite , but again provided that @xmath4 is constant along the time - like four - velocity vector of the fluid , @xmath29 .",
    "the question remains whether particles creation takes place in the regions where this condition does not hold .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the rastall s equations ( [ eq : rast1 ] ) can be recast into the same form as the usual einstein ones .",
    "indeed , one can immediately write    g_=_r s _  ,  [ eq : rast s ] where    s _ = t _ - g _",
    "[ eq : newten ] by construction , this new stress - energy tensor is conserved , @xmath30 . on introducing @xmath31",
    ", we can recover all the known solutions of einstein gr by simply taking care of the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , if we assume @xmath32 , i.e. the source is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 , we can explicitely work out an expression for @xmath31 .",
    "this turns out to be still a perfect fluid , provided we redefine its energy density and pressure as    @xmath35    in order to obtain the value of the coupling constant @xmath36 , we remember that the time - time component of the modified equations should recover the poisson equation in the static weak - field limit .",
    "one thus gets :    ( 3 _ r - ) = _ gr  , [ eq : kappagrrast ] whence it is immediate to derive exactly the same coupling as in einstein gravity only when @xmath22 , that is when the conservation of @xmath2 is granted .",
    "it has been recently claimed @xcite that a cardassian - like @xcite modification of the friedman equation in the form    h^2 =  , [ eq : taha ] can be obtained from rastall - like equations , where @xmath37 is a function of the cosmic time @xmath38 .",
    "we would now like to show that , although it is indeed possible to recast the rastall s theory equations in such a way that a cardassian - like model is recovered , the parameter @xmath39 in ( [ eq : taha ] ) must be a constant .",
    "to this aim , we derive the cosmological equations for the rastall s theory .",
    "we first remember that , when the isotropic and homogenous robertson - walker ( rw ) metric is adopted , in gr one gets the usual friedmann equations    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the hubble parameter , @xmath42 the scale factor and a dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath38 . to get the corresponding equations for the rastall s theory",
    ", one has to insert the rw metric into eqs.([eq : rast1 ] ) and consider the only independent equations that can be obtained , that is @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the master equation thus becomes    6 ( ^2 + a ) = - _ r a^2 ( - 3 p )  , [ eq : masterfrw ] so that multiplying eq.([eq : esseesse ] ) by @xmath44 and then adding to eq.([eq : titi ] ) we finally get the first modified friedmann s equation :    =  , [ eq : fr r1 ] which makes it possible to directly infer the sign of the acceleration . to obtain the second modified friedmann s equation ,",
    "it is easier to proceed in a slightly different way .",
    "let us first take the rastall s equations in the form    r _",
    "= _ r ( t _ - 1 2 t g _ )  . by inserting the rw metric and adding up eq.([eq : titi ] ) with three times eq.([eq :",
    "esseesse ] ) , we eventually obtain    h^2 =  .",
    "[ eq : fr r2 ] it is then only a matter of algebra to rearrange eqs.([eq : fr r1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fr r2 ] ) to write them as    h^2 =  , [ eq : rf1 ]    =  , [ eq : rf2 ] which reduce to the standard friedmann equations ( [ eq : frw1 ] ) and ( [ eq : frw2 ] ) when the parameter @xmath14 is switched off .",
    "note also that eq.([eq : rf1 ] ) has indeed the same expression as the cardassian - like eq.([eq : taha ] ) provided we set @xmath45 and accordingly redefine the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to show that @xmath39 must be a constant . indeed , from the condition    s^ _ ; = 0  , [ eq : conserv ] it is immediate to demonstrate that @xmath46 must be a constant by simply inserting the master equation ( [ eq : masterfrw ] ) into eq.([eq : conserv ] ) and using the rastall s requirement @xmath47 .",
    "so , an equation like ( [ eq : taha ] ) , can not be self - consistently obtained in rastall s model",
    ".    moreover , since @xmath2 is a perfect fluid and remembering the definition of @xmath31 , eq.([eq : conserv ] ) , we get    + 3 h ( + p ) = ( - 3 )  , [ eq : contrast ] which generalizes the continuity equation for the rastall s theory .    it is worth noticing that , even without integrating the equations , one can immediately predict whether the universe expansion is accelerating or not by simply studying the sign of the right hand side of eq.([eq : fr r1 ] ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the equation of state of the perfect fluid is a constant , i.e. setting @xmath48 , the condition @xmath49 selects two possible regimes , the first one being    w >  , provided @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath22 , however , the above relation reduces to @xmath51 in contrast with the gr result .",
    "we have therefore to choose the other solution , namely    w <  , [ eq : eos ] with @xmath52 . the right hand side of ( [ eq : eos ] )",
    "may be positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath46 . more precisely , if @xmath53 , then the right hand side is positive , while it is negative for @xmath54 .",
    "it is worth stressing that , however , the model always gives a monotonic behaviour : always decelerated or , as in the above analyzed case , always accelerated .    by the way , in the spirit of cardassians , the only sources of gravity are radiation and matter .",
    "in particular , the recent epoch is driven by the matter content , described as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath55 . with this constraint ,",
    "it is easy to show that an accelerated behaviour is obtained for @xmath56 , whereas we have a decelerated expansion choosing the following values @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "neglecting the radiation component , the only fluid sourcing the gravitational field is the standard matter , which can be modeled as dust , i.e. @xmath59 . in such a case ,",
    "the continuity equation ( [ eq : contrast ] ) is straightforwardly integrated giving :    @xmath60    with a @xmath61 subscript denoting present day quantities , @xmath62 the redshift ( having set @xmath63 for our flat - space universe ) , and    @xmath64    an effective equation of state ( eos ) for the dust matter , from which a relation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is easily deduced .",
    "note that , for @xmath22 , one recovers the usual matter scaling @xmath67 , while deviation from the standard behaviour occurs in @xmath68 rastall s theory .",
    "such a different scaling is not surprising at all being an expected consequence of the non - conservativity of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "inserting back eq.([eq : rhorast ] ) into eq.([eq : rf1 ] ) , we get    @xmath69    which is all what we need to compute the luminosity distance    @xmath70    with the hubble radius @xmath71 and @xmath72 the hubble constant in units of @xmath73 .",
    "we have now all the main ingredients to test the viability of the rastall s model by fitting the predicted luminosity distance to the data on the combined hubble diagram of sneia and grbs .",
    "to this aim , we maximize the following likelihood function :    @xmath74}\\ , \\",

    "@xcite to set the observed quantities @xmath79 for the sneia and grbs , respectively .",
    "since the hubble constant @xmath72 is degenerate with the ( unconstrained ) absolute magnitude of a sn , we have added a gaussian prior on @xmath72 using the results from the hst key project @xcite thus setting @xmath80 .",
    "the best fit model turns out to be    @xmath81    giving    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the number of degree of freedom of the model , with @xmath84 the number of sneia in the union sample , @xmath85 the number of grbs , and @xmath86 the number of parameters of the rastall s model .",
    "while for sneia we get a very good reduced @xmath77 , this is not the case for grbs so that one could be tempted to deem as unsuccessfull the fit .",
    "actually , fig.[fig : bestfit ] shows that the model is indeed fitting quite well both the sneia and grb data so that the large value of @xmath87 should be imputed to the large scatter of the high redshift data around the best fit line , not taken into account by the statistical error on the grbs distance modulus . in order to further test the model",
    ", one can consider the constraints on the matter density parameter .",
    "since our model only contains matter , one could naively think that @xmath88 . actually , one must also take into account that @xmath89 is defined using the gr coupling constant @xmath90 which is related to the rastall s coupuling @xmath36 through eq.([eq : kappagrrast ] ) .",
    "it is then a matter of algebra to show that @xmath91 so that , after marginalizing over @xmath72 , we get the following constraints :    @xmath92    where we have used the notation @xmath93 to mean that @xmath94 is the median value of the parameter and @xmath95 are the 68% and 95% confidence ranges respectively . note that the value thus obtained is in strong disagreement with the typical @xmath1 obtained from both the cosmic microwave background radiation data and cluster gas mass fractions .",
    "such a large matter density parameter is clearly unacceptable and represents a strong evidence against the rastall s model .",
    "it is worth noting that such a result could be qualitatively foreseen considering that , because of the non - conservativity of the matter stress - energy tensor , a sort of matter creation takes place thus increasing @xmath89 and leading to the final disagreement . + inverting the relation between @xmath89 and @xmath66",
    ", we get @xmath96 so that , for @xmath1 , we get @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , our best fit value for @xmath65 gives back a value for @xmath66 that falls outside the suitable range to reproduce an accelerated behaviour .",
    "in this paper we have focused on rastall s theory of gravity , which has been initially motivated by the need for a theory able to allow a non conservativity of the source stress - energy tensor without violating the bianchi identities . in particular , we have reexamined this model of gravity to investigate the possibility that it could reproduce the observed cosmic speed up .",
    "first , we have explicitly worked out the modified friedmann equations and we have shown that cardassian - like modifications of friedmann equations are obtained in rastall s model but , contrary to recent claims , they can not contain time - dependent parameters .",
    "then , we have confronted the model predictions with the available data concerning type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) : what we have showed is that it is possible to get an accelerated expansion that is in agreement with the hubble diagram of both sneia and grbs , even if there is unfortunately no possibility to reproduce an accelerated - decelerated - accelerated expansion for our universe as it seems to be requested .",
    "these results have also a major drawback : indeed , to get them it is necessary to postulate a matter density parameter much larger than the typical @xmath1 value inferred from cluster gas mass fraction data . as a consequence ,",
    "rastall s theory is not in agreement with current cosmological observations of late time acceleration .",
    "however , since the non - conservativity of the matter stress - energy tensor can be related to matter creation , such a model could have important effects during the inflationary period , as it has been suggested @xcite , even though an analysis of this issue is beyond the scopes of the present paper . +",
