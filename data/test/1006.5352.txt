    "according to roger myerson @xcite , the 1950 publication of nash s paper on equilibria was a watershed event not just for game theory , but for economics in general .",
    "the new general equilibrium concept , and its established universality , was an impetus for understanding rationality in much more general economic contexts , and inspired the important price equilibrium results by arrow and debreu .",
    "myerson argues convincingly in @xcite that the concept of nash equilibrium lies at the foundations of modern economic thought .",
    "seen from an algorithmic perspective , however , the nash equilibrium suffers from two important problems : first , it is not clear how to find it efficiently ( the same is true for the arrow - debreu variety for markets and prices ) .",
    "this shortcoming had already been identified by economists since the 1950s , and much effort has been devoted to algorithms for finding nash equilibria , see @xcite for examples from a very extensive literature . none of these algorithms came with polynomial - time guarantees , however , and the recent result @xcite establishing that the problem is ppad - complete explains why .",
    "of the many algorithmic approaches proposed by economists over the past 50 years for finding nash equilibria , most have been shown by now to require exponential time in the worst case @xcite .",
    "one exception is an important algorithmic genre known as _ homotopy methods _",
    "@xcite ; see @xcite for a recent survey . in topology ,",
    "homotopy _ is a continuous transformation from one function to another ( as , for example , between two paths joining two points on a map ) .",
    "the homotopy method starts with a fixpoint problem that is easy to solve ( say , a rotation of a disc around its center ) , and continuously transforms it into the problem in hand , by `` pivoting '' to new fixpoints along the way . a theorem by browder @xcite establishes the validity of this method in the limit , by showing the existence of a continuous path of fixpoints that joins two fixpoints of the initial and the final problems .",
    "the second algorithmic obstacle for the nash equilibrium concept is _ multiplicity .",
    "_ games have multiple equilibria , and markets many price equilibria , and thus the corresponding equilibrium concepts are only _ nondeterministic predictions _",
    "( oxymoron intended ) . in price equilibria",
    ", this multiplicity has been blamed for _ economic crises : _ the path guaranteed by browder s theorem is non - monotonic , going back and forth in time . as a result ,",
    "equilibria vanish at its folds , leaving the market in turmoil  @xcite . in games ,",
    "a proposed remedy for multiplicity is the so - called focal point theory see , e.g. , @xcite p.  414 , postulating that players implicitly coordinate their equilibrium choice by focusing on the most obvious , or mutually advantageous , equilibrium ; repeated play and learning ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can also be considered a remedy for multiplicity . in 1975 , harsanyi proposed the _ tracing procedure _",
    "@xcite for battling equilibrium multiplicity , a theory further explicated in his joint 1988 book `` a general theory of equilibrium selection in games '' with selten @xcite ( harsanyi and selten shared in 1994 the nobel prize with nash ) .",
    "the tracing procedure asserts that players engaged in a game @xmath0 play at first a simple game @xmath1 , in which their prior beliefs about the other players behavior result in a dominant strategy . as time @xmath2 progresses , and their priors",
    "are falsified by life , they play a more and more realistic game @xmath3 , until , at time @xmath4 , they end up playing the intended game @xmath0 .",
    "they show that , for almost all games , tracing the equilibrium path of this process results in a unique equilibrium .",
    "notice the parallel with the homotopy method ; apparently the two were discovered independently .",
    "[ [ our - results ] ] our results + + + + + + + + + + +    _ this paper is a complexity - theoretic critique of the tracing procedure and the homotopy method : _ we show that finding the solutions they prescribe requires the power of . in particular , finding the brouwer fixpoint that would have been discovered by the homotopy method , for a simple starting function and an adversarial final one , is -complete .",
    "the same is true , via standard reductions , for price equilibria .",
    "we also construct examples where the homotopy method not only will undergo an exponential number of pivots ( this was expected since  @xcite ) , but will suffer an exponential number of _ direction reversals . _ as for the tracing procedure , we show that it is -complete to find the nash equilibrium selected by it , even in two - player games , and even if the initial game has dominant strategies obtained from priors , exactly as prescribed by harsanyi and selten .",
    "we extend this result to homotopy - based algorithms where the starting game depends on the final game and show that it is -complete to implement the herings - van den elzen , herings - peeters , and van den elzen - talman algorithms for finding equilibria in games .",
    "finally , it is particularly noteworthy that -completeness prevails even for finding the solutions that would be returned by the classical lemke - howson algorithm , a simplex - like method that had long been considered an oasis of conceptual simplicity and ( until @xcite ) of algorithmic hope in this field .",
    "this reinforces the `` exponentially long paths '' result of  @xcite with a new result which says that , subject only to the hardness of , no short cuts to lemke - howson solutions are possible ( for any of the different initial choices of the algorithm ) .",
    "since it is known that the lemke - howson algorithm can be expressed as a homotopy  @xcite , this result can also be seen as a powerful specialization of our first result .",
    "the algorithms we consider solve problems in the complexity class ppad , which is contained in tfnp , the class of all total function problems in np .",
    "another prominent complexity class contained in tfnp is pls ( for polynomial local search ) .",
    "many common problems in pls ( e.g. , local max cut and finding pure equilibria of congestion games ) are complete under a so - called _ tight _ pls - reduction , implying that the corresponding standard local search algorithm is exponential ( for certain starting configurations and _ any _ choices of the local search algorithm ) .",
    "furthermore , one can conclude that the computational problem of finding a local optimum reachable from a given starting configuration by local search is -complete .",
    "no such concept of tight reductions is known for ppad , and our results can be seen as addressing this deficiency . specifically , we show the -completeness ( and exponential worst - case behaviour ) of a number of homotopy - based algorithms for finding equilibria .",
    "our reductions start with the problem other end of this line ( oeotl ) , which is related to the problem end of the line used in the definition is ppad , seeking not just any end of a path , but the other end of the particular path starting at the origin .",
    "oeotl was known to be -complete since  @xcite , but this fact has so far remained unexploited for proving lower bounds for other problems .",
    "[ [ outline - of - the - paper ] ] outline of the paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in section  [ sec : prelim_hom ] , we give an overview of the linear homotopy method as applied to brouwer functions and games . in section  [ sec :",

    "we give an outline of how to modify our first construction , so as to show that in following a sequence of approximate fixpoints of brouwer functions , or equilibria of games , @xmath2 may have to change direction exponentially many times , and furthermore , oscillate between values whose difference is bounded away from zero .",
    "@xmath18 shall be the same as in theorem  [ thm : pspace - brouwer ] .",
    "we construct a modified form of @xmath19 , which we will call @xmath383 , as follows .",
    "we identify two subsets of the cubelets @xmath68 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 , defined as @xmath386 , and @xmath387 .",
    "these subsets are `` thin layers '' of cubelets that are perpendicular to the @xmath112-axis .",
    "now we define how @xmath383 behaves on points at the centers of cubelets . for @xmath27 at the center of @xmath68 , @xmath388    for points not at the centers of cubelets , @xmath383 shall interpolate between the values at the nearest cubelet centers , using the same general approach as @xmath19 . let @xmath389 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of cubelets @xmath68 for which @xmath390 , so @xmath6 is the region where fixpoints of @xmath391 may exist .",
    "let @xmath392 be the connected component of @xmath6 which contains the cubelet @xmath393 , so @xmath392 is the region within which fixpoints of @xmath391 will occur on the homotopy path .    by construction , @xmath392 has the property that @xmath394 ( and similarly @xmath395 ) has exponentially many connected components .",
    "this follows from the construction of  @xcite from which @xmath6 is derived ; @xmath6 simulates a @xmath54-graph by , for each edge of the @xmath54-graph , including a long sequence of cubelets that passes through both @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "now consider points in @xmath396 .",
    "the claim is that fixpoints @xmath27 of @xmath391 for which @xmath397 , satisfy @xmath398 , and that for fixpoints @xmath27 of @xmath391 with @xmath399 we have @xmath400 .",
    "the general idea ( in the first case ; the second case is similar ) is that @xmath401 will map points @xmath112 in @xmath384 to points @xmath402 for which at least one component of @xmath403 is greater than @xmath404 .",
    "hence for @xmath405 , @xmath391 raises the value of this component ( the positive contribution from @xmath383 exceeds the negative contribution from @xmath18 ) and prevents it from being a fixpoint .",
    "the homotopy path must pass through this long sequence of regions that require @xmath406 or else @xmath407 . moreover , the two types of regions alternate , so we establish the following result :    for continuous functions defined using arithmetic circuits , the sequence of fixpoints along the path given by the linear homotopy @xmath408 has exponentially many alternations of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain the following corollary :    for graphical or two - player games , suppose @xmath1 is a game that assigns each player a dominating strategy , and @xmath0 is an arbitrary game . the linear tracing procedure for the homotopy @xmath165 will , in the worst case , have exponentially many reversals of @xmath2 .",
    "the corollary follows since , the way we represent brouwer functions parameterized by @xmath2 in terms of games parameterized by @xmath2 , does not change the value of @xmath2 .",
    "since we did not change @xmath18 , the associated game @xmath1 is the same `` dominating strategy '' game of section  [ sec : lt ] .",
    "we can use the machinery of chen et al .",
    "@xcite so that when we talk about the hardness of finding an @xmath29-fixpoint , @xmath29 is allowed to be inverse polynomial rather than inverse exponential .",
    "this is achieved by using the snake embeddings of  @xcite .",
    "snake - embeddings a snake embedding reduces a low - dimensional brouwer - mapping function having @xmath44 of cubelets in each dimension , to a @xmath409 dimensional bmf having @xmath410 cubelets in each dimension , in such a way that panchromatic vertices of the high - dimensional bmf efficiently encode panchromatic vertices of the low - dimensional bmf .",
    "the reduction can be decomposed into a sequence of @xmath409 iterations , in which at each iteration , the number of cubelets along some axis is reduced by a constant factor , and we acquire an additional axis having @xmath410 cubelets ( in  @xcite it is in fact 8 cubelets ) .",
    "( intuitively , the space is folded a constant number of times and gains thickness along the new dimension . )    a specific snake - embedding , and some notation we consider a snake - embedding of a 3-dimensional bmf @xmath89 of the type of proposition  [ prop : graph ] .",
    "initially the colors are @xmath75 ; let @xmath411 denote the new color at the @xmath134-th iteration and let @xmath212 be the number of iterations required to reduce to 8 the number of cubelets along each axis .",
    "let @xmath413 be the unit @xmath45-dimensional cube .",
    "partition @xmath413 into cubelets @xmath414 where @xmath415 represents a cubelet of edge length @xmath416 .",
    "a _ brouwer - mapping circuit _ maps each such cubelet to one of the colors @xmath417 . again",
    ", a bmf should be polynomial - time computable , and map exterior cubelets to color @xmath134 for cubelets whose @xmath134-th coordinate contains the first 0 ( when @xmath418 contains a 0 ) , otherwise color 0 .",
    "other types of bmf that correspond to definition  [ def : bmf ] are defined analogously .",
    "the high - dimensional bmf can be computed by a brouwer - mapping circuit @xmath342 that is polynomial in the size of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath419 be the function computed .",
    "the challenge is to implement @xmath419 using an arithmetic circuit that is polynomial in the size of the circuit that computes the bmf , and computes a lipschitz continuous function .",
    "the simplicial - decomposition technique of theorem  [ thm : bmf2circ ] no longer works when we move to non - constant dimension , since the number of simplices per cubelet is exponential in the dimension .",
    "the cubelets having colors @xmath421 are mapped to cubelets in the @xmath420-dimensional instance in such a way as to have the same neighborhood structure , but with some duplication at the folds of the embedding .",
    "the continuous implementation define @xmath422 as follows .",
    "if @xmath27 lies at the center of a cubelet ( of length @xmath416 ) , letting @xmath423 , @xmath424 , where @xmath425 if @xmath426 is the background color @xmath427 , otherwise @xmath428 where the position of the non - zero entry depends on the color @xmath426 , and is chosen to satisfy the boundary conditions of a bmf .    if @xmath27 does not lie at the center of a cubelet , we claim that for each color @xmath426 , we can efficiently compute the @xmath113 distance from @xmath27 to the closest center of a cubelet having color @xmath426 , using a linear arithmetic circuit .",
    "let @xmath429 $ ] be this distance .",
    "let @xmath430 .",
    "then define @xmath431 . in that expression for @xmath432",
    ", @xmath433 is a constant vector , so we are not multiplying two computed quantities together ( which is disallowed in a linear arithmetic circuit )",
    ".    why it works if we are not within distance @xmath381 of a panchromatic vertex , then @xmath434 where @xmath426 is one of the missing colors . however , there is some @xmath435 for which @xmath436 .",
    "the choice of the vectors @xmath433 ensure that @xmath437 .",
    "consequently any approximate fixpoint of @xmath438 is close to a panchromatic vertex of @xmath419 . to show that it is close enough to permit that panchromatic vertex to be efficiently reconstructed from the coordinates of the fixpoint , it is easiest to assume that there are 24 rather than 8 cubelets along each axis , with the original cubelets having been divided into 27 smaller ones all having the same color",
    ". then an approximate fixpoint can be assumed to lie within @xmath439 of a panchromatic vertex .",
    "we also need to point out that the high - dimensional bmf @xmath419 has a path of @xmath440-chromatic cubelets which simulates the path of @xmath90-chromatic cubelets in the bmf @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the one obtained by following the path in @xmath419 , encodes the one obtained by following the corresponding path in @xmath89 .    by way of a final remark ,",
    "it is necessary for us to make a snake embedding of our 3d graph into higher dimension , rather than ( as in  @xcite ) reduce from the 2d version of the problem  @xcite .",
    "this is because the ppad - completeness of 2d sperner  @xcite is a reduction that alters the structure of the end of the line graph being encoded , and so would not ( in an obvious way ) apply in a reduction from oeotl ."
