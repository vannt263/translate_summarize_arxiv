    "in this section , we discuss the different experimental ways to define diffraction . as an example , we describe the methods used by the h1 and zeus experiments at hera , desy , hamburg in germany .      hera is a collider where electrons of 27.6 gev collide with protons of 920 gev . a typical event as shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "1 is @xmath2 where electron and jets are produced in the final state .",
    "we notice that the electron is scattered in the h1 backward detector ( in green ) whereas some hadronic activity is present in the forward region of the detector ( in the lar calorimeter and in the forward muon detectors ) .",
    "the proton is thus completely destroyed and the interaction leads to jets and proton remnants directly observable in the detector .",
    "the fact that much energy is observed in the forward region is due to colour exchange between the scattered jet and the proton remnants . in about 10% of the events , the situation is completely different .",
    "such events appear like the one shown in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "the electron is still present in the backward detector , there is still some hadronic activity ( jets ) in the lar calorimeter , but no energy above noise level is deposited in the forward part of the lar calorimeter or in the forward muon detectors . in other words , there is no color exchange between the proton and the produced jets . as an example , this can be explained if the proton stays intact after the interaction .",
    "this experimental observation leads to the first definition of diffraction : request a rapidity gap ( in other words a domain in the forward detectors where no energy is deposited above noise level ) in the forward region .",
    "for example , the h1 collaboration requests no energy deposition in the rapidity region @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pseudorapidity .",
    "let us note that this approach does not insure that the proton stays intact after the interaction , but it represents a limit on the mass of the produced object @xmath5 gev . within this limit , the proton could be dissociated .",
    "the adavantage of the rapidity gap method is that it is quite easy to implement and it has a large acceptance in the diffractive kinematical plane .",
    "[ fig1 ]      the second experimental method to detect diffractive events is also natural : the idea is to detect directly the intact proton in the final state .",
    "the proton loses a small fraction of its energy and is thus scattered at very small angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "some special detectors called roman pots can be used to detect the protons close to the beam .",
    "the basic idea is simple : the roman pot detectors are located far away from the interaction point and can move close to the beam , when the beam is stable , to detect protons scattered at vary small angles .",
    "the inconvenience is that the kinematical reach of those detectors is much smaller than with the rapidity gap method . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage is that it gives a clear signal of diffraction since it measures the diffracted proton directly .    a scheme of a roman pot detector as it is used by the h1 or zeus experiment",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the beam is the horizontal line at the upper part of the figure .",
    "the detector is located in the pot itself and can move closer to the beam when the beam is stable enough ( during the injection period , the detectors are protected in the home position ) .",
    "step motors allow to move the detectors with high precision .",
    "a precise knowledge of the detector position is necessary to reconstruct the transverse momentum of the scattered proton and thus the diffractive kinematical variables .",
    "the detectors are placed in a secondary vaccuum with respect to the beam one .",
    "[ fig2 ]      the third method used at hera mainly by the zeus experiment is slightly less natural .",
    "it is based on the fact that there is a different behaviour in @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the total invariant mass produced in the event either for diffractive or non diffractive events . for diffractive events @xmath8if@xmath9 ( which is the case for diffractive events ) .",
    "the zeus collaboration performs some fits of the @xmath10 distribution : @xmath11 as illustrated in fig .",
    "the usual non diffractive events are exponentially suppressed at high values of @xmath6 .",
    "the difference between the observed @xmath10 data and the exponential suppressed distribution is the diffractive event contribution .",
    "this method , although easy to implement , presents the inconvenience that it relies strongly on the assumption of the exponential suppression of non diffractive events .",
    "[ fig3 ]      after having described the different experimental definitions of diffraction at hera , we will give the new kinematical variables used to characterise diffraction .",
    "a typical diffractive event is shown in fig . 4 where @xmath12 is depicted .",
    "in addition to the usual deep inelastic variables , @xmath13 the transfered energy squared at the electron vertex , @xmath14 the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark , @xmath15 the total energy in the final state , new diffractive variables are defined : @xmath16 is the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the colourless object called the pomeron , and @xmath17 the momentum fraction of the pomeron carried by the interacting parton inside the pomeron if we assume the pomeron to be made of quarks and gluons : @xmath18    [ fig4 ]",
    "in the following diffractive structure function analysis , we distinguish two kinds of factorisation at hera .",
    "the first factorisation is the qcd hard scattering collinear factorisation at fixed @xmath16 and @xmath19 ( see left plot of fig .",
    "5 ) @xcite , namely    @xmath20    where we can factorise the flux @xmath21 from the cross section @xmath22 .",
    "this factorisation was proven recently , and separates the @xmath23 coupling to the interaction with the colourless object .",
    "the regge factorisation at the proton vertex allows to factorise the @xmath24 and @xmath25 dependence , or in other words the hard interaction from the pomeron coupling to the proton ( see right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]      the different measurements are performed using the three different methods to define diffractive events described in the first section . as an example , the h1 collaboration measures the diffractive cross section @xmath26 using the rapidity gap method :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the reduced diffractive cross section .",
    "the measurement @xcite is presented in fig",
    "we notice that the measurement has been performed with high precision over a wide kinematical domain : @xmath29 , @xmath30 gev@xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the data are compared to the result of a qcd fit which we will discuss in the following .",
    "the rapidity gap data are also compared with the data obtained either using the @xmath6 method or the one using proton tagging in roman pot detectors .",
    "since they do not correspond exactly to the same definition of diffraction , a correction factor of 0.85 must be applied to the zeus @xmath6 method to be compared to the rapidity gap one ( this factor is due to the fact that the two methods correspond to two different regions in @xmath33 , namely @xmath5 gev for h1 and @xmath34 gev for zeus ) .",
    "it is also possible to measure directly in the h1 experiment the ratio of the diffractive structure function measurements between the rapidity gap and the proton tagging methods as illustrated in fig .",
    "unfortunately , the measurement using the proton tagging method is performed only in a restricted kinematical domain .",
    "no kinematical dependence has been found within uncertainties for this ratio inside this kinematical domain ( see fig . 7 for the @xmath17 and @xmath13 dependence , and ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath16 dependence as well ) .",
    "note that the ratio could still be depending on @xmath17 and @xmath13 outside the limited domain of measurement .",
    "[ fig6 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig20 ]    [ fig20b ]      in the same way that higgs bosons can be produced exclusively , it is possible to produce @xmath0 , top and stops quark pairs .",
    "@xmath35 bosons are produced via qed processes which means that their cross section is perfectly known .",
    "on the contrary , top and stop pair production are obtained via double pomeron exchanges and the production cross section is still uncertain .    the method to reconstruct the mass of heavy objects double diffractively produced at the lhc",
    "is based on a fit to the turn - on point of the missing mass distribution at threshold @xcite .",
    "one proposed method ( the `` histogram '' method ) corresponds to the comparison of the mass distribution in data with some reference distributions following a monte carlo simulation of the detector with different input masses corresponding to the data luminosity .",
    "as an example , we can produce a data sample for 100 fb@xmath36 with a top mass of 174 gev , and a few mc samples corresponding to different top masses between 150 and 200 gev . for each monte carlo sample ,",
    "a @xmath37 value corresponding to the population difference in each bin between data and mc is computed .",
    "the mass point where the @xmath37 is minimum corresponds to the mass of the produced object in data .",
    "this method has the advantage of being easy but requires a good simulation of the detector .",
    "the other proposed method ( the `` turn - on fit '' method ) is less sensitive to the mc simulation of the detectors .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the threshold scan is directly sensitive to the mass of the diffractively produced object ( in the @xmath35 case for instance , it is sensitive to twice the @xmath35 mass ) .",
    "the idea is thus to fit the turn - on point of the missing mass distribution which leads directly to the mass of the produced object , the @xmath35 boson . due to its robustness , this method is considered as the  default \" one .",
    "the precision of the @xmath35 mass measurement ( 0.3 gev for 300 fb@xmath36 ) is not competitive with other methods , but provides a very precise check of the calibration of the roman pot detectors .",
    "@xmath35 events will also allow to assess directly the sensitivity to the photon anomalous coupling since it would reveal itself by a modification of the well - known qed @xmath35 production cross section .",
    "we can notice that the @xmath35 production cross section is proportional to the fourth power of the @xmath38 coupling which ensures a very good sensitivity of that process @xcite .",
    "the precision of the top mass measurement is however competitive , with an expected precision better than 1 gev at high luminosity provided that the cross section is high enough .",
    "the other application is to use the so - called  threshold - scan method \" to measure the stop mass @xcite . after taking into account the stop width",
    ", we obtain a resolution on the stop mass of 0.4 , 0.7 and 4.3 gev for a stop mass of 174.3 , 210 and 393 gev for a luminosity ( divided by the signal efficiency ) of 100 fb@xmath36 .",
    "the caveat is of course that the production via diffractive exclusive processes is model dependent , and definitely needs the tevatron and lhc data to test the models .",
    "it will allow us to determine more precisely the production cross section by testing and measuring at the tevatron the jet and photon production for high masses and high dijet or diphoton mass fraction .",
    "in these lectures , we presented and discussed the most recent results on inclusive diffraction from the hera and tevatron experiments and gave the prospects for the future at the lhc .",
    "of special interest is the exclusive production of higgs boson and heavy objects ( @xmath0 , top , stop pairs ) which will require a better understanding of diffractive events and the link between @xmath1 and hadronic colliders , and precise measurements and analyses of inclusive diffraction at the lhc in particular to constrain further the gluon density in the pomeron .",
