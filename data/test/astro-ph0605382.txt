    "fu orionis is the prototype of a small , but quite remarkable class of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) normally referred to as fu ori objects ( fuors ) .",
    "for the first members of this class an outburst in optical light of up to 4 - 6 magnitudes over short time scales , followed by a decrease in luminosity over several years or decades , was observed @xcite .",
    "other objects were included in the class as they shared common specific spectroscopic features , e.g. , double - peaked line profiles , a spectral type varying with wavelength and often co bandhead absorption features . as for one object ( v1057 cyg ) the pre - outburst spectrum is known and as it resembles that of a classical ttauri star @xcite , it is commonly assumed that fuors should be low - mass ysos .",
    "most observational data can be explained by the presence of an accretion disk surrounding the young stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* however , found that some spectral properties are well explained in the context of rapidly rotating late - type stars with strong stellar winds ) . a dramatic temporal increase in the accretion rate , where the disk outshines the star by several orders of magnitude , can account for the observed outbursts in luminosity .",
    "several scenarios , possibly triggering such an increased accretion rate , have thus far been proposed .",
    "they include ( a ) interactions of binary or multiple systems where tidal forces disturb the circumstellar disk @xcite , ( b ) planet - disk interactions , where thermal instabilities in the disk are caused by the presence of a massive planet @xcite , or ( c ) thermal instabilities in the disk alone @xcite . for a detailed overview concerning the fu ori phenomenon we refer to @xcite .",
    "apart from revealing the mechanism leading to the observed outbursts , it is also important to investigate whether all ttauri stars undergo such epochs of enhanced accretion or whether fuors are a special class of ysos .",
    "most observations of classical ttauri stars show that the derived accretion rates of @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not sufficient to build up a low - mass star over time scales of a few myr .",
    "even if part of the matter is supposed to be accreted in the very early phases of a yso , fuor - phases might provide an elegant solution to this problem as they would speed up the accretion process .    as so far only a dozen or so well established fuors are known and as the fuor - phase has significant impact on the young star - disk system it is crucial to combine as much observational information as possible for these objects to eventually derive a coherent theoretical picture . based on near - infrared ( nir ) and/or",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) interferometry as a technique to study the inner few au of the accretion disks new insights to some of the best studied fuors were provided recently .",
    "@xcite found that accretion disks alone can not reproduce the sed and observed low k - band visibilities for v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg and z cma - se simultaneously .",
    "they concluded that additional uncorrelated flux may arise due to scattering by large dusty envelopes .",
    "@xcite presented the first vlti/ midi observations of v1647 ori whose eruptive behavior suggests that it is either an fuor or an ex lupi ( exor ) type object . in this case",
    "it was possible to fit both , the sed and the observed mir visibility with a simple disk model with moderate disk flaring .",
    "for fu ori itself it was @xcite who analyzed a wealth of nir interferometric data .",
    "they showed that the nir visibilities and the sed could be fitted with two models : one consisting simply of an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk and a second one consisting of an accretion disk and an embedded `` hot spot '' . from their error statistics",
    "these authors concluded that the latter model was more likely .    in summary",
    "it becomes clear that up to now no coherent picture can be derived from the interferometric observations of fuors and the group of objects seems to be rather inhomogeneous .",
    "in this paper we present the first mir interferometric measurements of fu orionis .",
    "the data are thus complementary to the nir observations of malbet et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the observations and the data reduction process . in section 3",
    "we discuss the findings derived from the n - band acquisition images .",
    "the 8 - 13@xmath0 m spectrum of fu ori is analyzed in section 4 . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we discuss the results from the interferometric measurements , i.e. the visibilities and the correlated flux spectra , respectively . a simple analytical disk model and its fit to the sed and the visibilities is presented in section 7 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions and mention some future prospects in section 8 .",
    "the observations were carried out between october 31@xmath2 and november 4@xmath3 2004 with the mid - infrared interferometric instrument ( midi ) at eso s very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) on paranal / chile .",
    "together with the keck interferometer nuller that recently started to produce first scientific results @xcite , midi is currently worldwide the only instrument able to conduct spectrally resolved interferometric observations in the mid - infrared @xcite . for the observations midi was used in high - sens mode using the nacl prism as dispersive element yielding a spectral resolution of 30 .",
    "the maximum projected baseline was 86.25 m and the minimum projected baseline 44.56 m leading to an angular resolution at 10@xmath0 m of 0.@xmath4029 and 0.@xmath4056 , respectively .",
    "for an assumed distance of 450 pc these values correspond to 13.1 au and 25.2 au .",
    "a journal of the observations including projected baselines , position angles and calibrator stars is given in table  [ journal ] .",
    "for completeness we also mention the observations from december 2004 although they are disregarded in the following sections .",
    "these observations had almost exactly the same baseline and position angle as the october observations but showed in general a lower level of total and correlated flux due to rather poor observing conditions in terms of seeing and transparency . the calibrator stars for the data reduction",
    "were chosen by analyzing all calibrator stars observed over the whole night .",
    "we selected those showing a good agreement in their transfer functions , i.e. their instrumental visibilities after the assumed sizes were taken into account .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with the software package mia+ews-1.3 .",
    "this software consists of two independent reduction programs ( mia and ews ) which were both applied for comparison . the software , further information and manuals can be downloaded from the internetnevec / midi / index.html ] . a general description of the basic data reduction steps is also given in @xcite and we refer the reader to this paper . as the results derived with mia and ews agreed quite well ( overall differences in the correlated flux @xmath5 ) , we decided to show only plots resulting from the mia package .",
    "fu ori was found to be a binary system by @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the detected companion and concluded that it was a young star of spectral type k showing clear nir excess . in the same paper it was",
    "also stated that it was very unlikely that the binary component ( fu ori s ) triggered the outburst of fu ori observed in the late 1930s .",
    "knowing about the existence of the fainter companion the integration time of some midi acquisition images was increased in order to derive n - band photometry for both components . in three images",
    "fu ori s was clearly visible ( figure  [ image ] ) and aperture photometry could be applied to the observations .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ fluxes ] .",
    "interestingly , fu ori s shows relatively a higher n - band excess than fu ori itself .",
    "this can be explained in terms of differences in the geometry of an assumed circumstellar disks ( e.g. , larger flaring angle or smaller disk inclination ) .",
    "we furthermore derive a separation between the components of 0.@xmath4484@xmath60.@xmath401 and a position angle of 162.5@xmath74.1@xmath8 ( measured from north eastwards ) which is in good agreement with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our errors are standard deviations based on gaussian fitting of 3 independent images . for an assumed distance of 450 pc",
    "the separation corresponds to 217.8@xmath64.5 au .",
    "figure  [ spectrum_short ] shows the mir spectrum of fu ori .",
    "the spectrum obtained with midi is the average over the first three observing nights using both unit telescopes ( uts ) . for comparison _",
    "spitzer irs _ data are plotted additionally .",
    "those data were available from the _ spitzer _ data archive .",
    "for the data reduction we used the _ droopres _ intermediate data product processed through the ssc pipeline s12.0.2 . the smart reduction package developed by the irs instrument team at cornell @xcite",
    "was used to extract the spectrum . within",
    "the error bars the spectra agree quite well .",
    "a broad and weak silicate emission feature is present between 8 - 13@xmath0 m .",
    "however , the averaged midi spectrum appears to be a little flatter than the more roundish _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "in contrast to other ysos the observed silicate emission feature of fu ori is rather weak ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . such a broad and flat mir dust spectrum can be explained by grains that already underwent some coagulation process @xcite . to test this hypothesis we derived a possible dust composition by fitting a dust model to the normalized and continuum subtracted _ spitzer _ spectrum from 6 - 13@xmath0 m .",
    "this analysis method is similar to approaches that were successfully applied in previous studies for determining the dust composition of observed dust emission features of other ysos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the model we assume that the observed emission can be computed from the sum of the emission of individual dust species .",
    "the species we used are summarized in table  [ dust_species ] together with references for their optical properties .",
    "we furthermore took into account different grain sizes as for each of the dust species the opacities were calculated for 0.1 , 1.5 , and 6.0@xmath0 m sized particles . to estimate the possible contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) to the emission we used a template spectrum based on profiles that were derived from observations @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to reproduce the observed spectrum we fitted the following emission model to the _ spitzer _ data using a least square minimization @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the observed flux , @xmath11 denotes the planck function at the temperature of the underlying continuum , @xmath12 the planck function at the temperature of the silicate grains , @xmath13 is the mass absorption coefficient for the silicate species @xmath14 with the grain size @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the template emission spectrum for the pahs , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the weighting factors for the continuum , the silicate emission and the pah contribution , respectively .",
    "a more detailed description of the dust model and plots showing the different dust opacities is given in @xcite .",
    "the model results are shown in figure  [ dust_spectra ] and table  [ dust_compo ] summarizes the corresponding dust composition . as for the underlying continuum we could fit a temperature of 880 k , we believe that this optically thick emission most likely arises from the inner parts of the disk close to the star",
    ". the outer and thus cooler regions of the disk would then be responsible for the weak silicate emission for which we fitted a temperature of 230 k to the optically thin emission layer .",
    "the results strongly support the idea that most particles are amorphous and much larger in size than those in the ism .",
    "pahs , silica particles and crystalline silicates do not seem to be present at all .",
    "although the derived fractions of different dust species do depend on the model applied to the data ( e.g. , in terms of the precise grain sizes considered and also in terms of particle structures ) the main conclusions , that we do not find evidence for crystalline silicates and that the grains are considerably larger than those found in the ism , remain unaltered . for a more detailed discussion about the influence of different model parameters we refer to @xcite and @xcite .    as the disk is much brighter in the optical and nir than the central star ( section 7 ) ,",
    "stellar radiation is probably not able to produce the observed weak emission feature in an optically thin disk surface layer .",
    "however , it was shown that the silicate feature of fu ori can be reproduced taking into account self - irradiation of the disk @xcite . in this case",
    "the hot inner parts of the accretion disk serve as flux source and illuminate the disk surface layer under a certain angle .",
    "in figure  [ visibilities ] and table  [ visibilities_table ] the visibilities measured for fu ori at three different baselines are shown .",
    "the errors are computed as standard deviations resulting from the use of different calibrators for each night ( see table  [ journal ] ) . in most of the following plots",
    "the position of the atmospheric ozone band is indicated as this part of the spectrum suffered sometimes from imperfect corrections during the data reduction process . here ,",
    "small `` dips '' and `` bumps '' in otherwise flat spectra are remnants from the data reduction .      the calibrated visibility of the shortest baseline ( ut2-ut3 ) remains almost constant at @xmath200.95 over the whole wavelength range and the source is only marginally resolved . as expected , for the longest baseline ( ut2-ut4 ) the lowest visibility",
    "is observed ranging from @xmath200.73 at 8.3@xmath0 m to @xmath200.6 at 13@xmath0 m . for the intermediate baseline ( ut3-ut4 ) the visibility shows a slight increase from @xmath200.73 at 8.3@xmath0 m to @xmath200.85 at 13@xmath0 m .",
    "the fact that the object is clearly resolved with two baselines in the mir supports the argument of @xcite that we are observing an extended circumstellar structure , i.e. a disk , and not only the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "for the two baselines ut2-ut3 and ut2-ut4 the observations are consistent with expectations from thermal disk emission as despite the decreasing resolution for longer wavelengths the visibilities indicate larger sizes for the emitting regions ( see also section 5.3 . ) .",
    "the observed increase in visibility for the ut3-ut4 baseline implies that for this baseline , however , the object appears smaller at 13@xmath0 m than at 8@xmath0 m .",
    "this seems difficult to imagine in the context of a circumstellar disk as emitting source and certainly a second observation for this baseline configuration seems eligible . theoretically it is possible that the photometric measurements carried out directly after the interferometric observations are corrupted due to technical problems or different weather conditions .",
    "this in turn might then lead to a change in the visibility function .",
    "however , the calibrators observed at this night did not show any sign of poor photometric measurements and their transfer function was very stable over the whole night .",
    "in addition , also other ysos with circumstellar disks showed an increasing visibility for certain baselines when observed with midi .",
    "thus , since we do not find any evidence for excluding this dataset due to bad quality we decided to keep it in our analyses .      as thus far no midi visibilities for ttauri stars",
    "have been published we are limited to a comparison between fu ori and circumstellar disks around herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) .",
    "it shows that these stars as well as models applied to them normally show a prominent drop in the visibility between 8@xmath0 m and 10@xmath0 m from where the curve remains almost constant @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this drop results from the intensity distribution of the passive disks around the haebes : at the short wavelength end the hot inner rim of the disks provides an overproportional contribution to the flux and is at the same time confined to a small spatial region leading to a high visibility .",
    "most of the rest of the mir emission originates from a large area of the hot , illuminated surface layer of the flared circumstellar disk .",
    "the visibilities for fu ori show hardly any wavelength dependence and are very flat from 8 - 13@xmath0 m regardless of baseline .",
    "thus , its seems as if the flux distribution of fu ori is smoother and the visibilities show no sign of a significant contribution from a hot inner rim .",
    "however , as fu ori is surrounded by a heavily active accretion disk where the disk alone produces the majority of the observed flux at almost all wavelengths ( see section 7 ) differences in the intensity distribution and thus in the visibility can be expected .",
    "apart from differences in the shape of the visibility curves most haebes are much better resolved , i.e. show lower visibilities than fu ori @xcite .",
    "this , however , can at least partly be explained by the distance to these objects which is in general less than 200 pc .",
    "fu ori on the other hand has an assumed distance of 450 pc , and if it was closer to the earth we would observe lower visibilities also for this object .      to derive a simple model for the geometry of the emitting regions we assume a simple gaussian brightness distribution for each baseline .",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation for objects showing high visibilities .",
    "the fwhm , and hence the physical size , of this gaussian in arcsec can be computed by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the measured visibility for a certain spatial frequency @xmath23 ( in arcsec@xmath24 ) derived from the projected baseline @xmath25 and the wavelength @xmath26 .",
    "equation  [ visi_eq ] results from a simple fourier transformation of the assumed brightness distribution .",
    "we computed the fwhm for all three baselines at three different wavelengths ( 9.0 , 11.0 , and 12.5@xmath0 m ) . for this we averaged for each baseline 5 visibility points from table  [ visibilities_table ] centered on the specified wavelengths .",
    "table  [ table_sizes ] gives the resulting sizes of the emitting regions in au for an assumed distance to fu ori of 450 pc .",
    "the results are also visualized in figure  [ figure_sizes ] where the fwhm are shown in their orientation on the sky .",
    "as expected for thermal disk emission the fwhm increases with wavelength for a given baseline .",
    "the only exception is the 12.5@xmath0 m size for the ut3-ut4 baseline which is surprisingly a little smaller than that seen at 11.0@xmath0 m .",
    "in addition to size estimations for each individual baseline our measurements based on different position angles allow to constrain the geometry of the disk .",
    "we fitted the derived fwhm with an ellipse for each of the considered wavelengths in order to derive a simple model for the spatial orientation of an assumed disk - like structure .",
    "the resulting best fit ellipses are overplotted in figure  [ figure_sizes ] and their parameters are summarized in the lower half of table  [ table_sizes ] . as one would expect from a disk - like structure showing a decrease in temperature with radius the semimajor axes of the ellipses increase with wavelength . however , due to the increasing visibility of the ut3-ut4 baseline the semiminor axis and also the total area of the ellipse are slightly smaller at 12.5@xmath0 m than at 11.0@xmath0 m .",
    "an inclination angle for an assumed circular disk can be derived by computing the @xmath27 of the ratio of the semiminor and semimajor axis .",
    "the resulting angles agree very well ( 55.4@xmath72.4@xmath8 ) and are also in good agreement to what was found for fu ori disk models based on nir observations @xcite . by combining the derived inclination angle with rotational velocity measurements in the optical spectral region it is possible to estimate the central mass . based on @xcite",
    "we derive for fu ori @xmath280.36 which is reasonably consistent with typical values for low - mass pre - main sequence stars .",
    "in addition to the inclination the fitted ellipses provide also information on the position angle of the disk . the position angles ( measured from north eastwards )",
    "we find for the semimajor axes at different wavelengths show a larger scatter ( 109.1@xmath711.6@xmath8 ) than the inclinations and differ significantly from the nir findings of @xcite ( see also section 7 ) .",
    "it seems as if the position angle becomes smaller for longer wavelengths , although one has to keep in mind that , again , at least for the ut3-ut4 baseline the increasing visibility is the main reason for the observed rotation . at this point",
    "we leave it to future investigations to derive a 3-d disk model based on a more complex dust distribution possibly able to confirm the apparent changes in the position angle for different wavelength regimes .",
    "the correlated flux is directly linked to the total flux ( i.e. the flux from a single ut telescope ) via the visibility : @xmath29 figure  [ correlflux ] depicts the results for the correlated flux for the three different baselines .",
    "the total spectrum is plotted for comparison .",
    "taking into account the spatial resolution of the three baselines it is possible to estimate from where the correlated 8 - 13@xmath0 m flux originates .",
    "our ut2-ut3 baseline has a spatial resolution of @xmath2025 au at the distance of fu ori , and if we assume an average visibility of 0.95 we hence know that 95% of the 8@xmath0m-13@xmath0 m flux must come from within this 25 au .",
    "similarly , we find that for the ut2-ut4 baseline 65% of the flux is emitted from the inner 13 au . for the ut3-ut4 baseline 75% of the 8 - 13@xmath0 m flux comes from the inner 20 au .",
    "the spatially resolved mir spectra of the midi instrument make it possible to study the radial dependence of the dust composition in the protoplanetary disk @xcite . in section 4",
    "we showed that the spatially unresolved ( total ) spectrum of fu ori can be fitted with mainly large amorphous dust grains .",
    "the shape of the spatially resolved ( correlated ) flux spectra contains information about the dust composition of the inner parts of the disk .    to compare the shape of the correlated spectra to the total spectrum we first subtracted the continuum for which we fitted a straight line between the flux at 8.25 and 12.95@xmath0 m .",
    "then we normalized all continuum subtracted correlated flux spectra and the total _",
    "spectrum by @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the continuum subtracted spectra and their mean value , respectively . by applying this formula all correlated spectra conserve their shape and can be compared to the total spectrum ( figure  [ shape_correl ] ) . to identify those parts",
    "where the spectra differ significantly we furthermore computed the deviation from the total _",
    "spectrum for each wavelength in units of the data error : @xmath33    @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the normalized correlated spectra and the normalized total spectrum and @xmath36 denotes the standard deviation of the correlated spectra ( midi errors ) at a given wavelength .",
    "we applied the same normalization factors to the errors as we did to the spectra .",
    "figure  [ shape_correl ] shows that no clear deviations from the total unresolved spectrum are observed for any of the correlated spectra .",
    "this means that with the given spatial resolution and sensitivity no significant chemical difference in the dust composition is observed and the spectra of the inner parts of the disk look very similar to the total unresolved disk spectrum .",
    "this finding is somewhat surprising .",
    "as seen in section 4 the silicate dust grains apparently already underwent noticeable coagulation .",
    "thus , the disk does not consist of purely ism dust anymore and must already have a significant age .",
    "in addition it is known that apart from grain growth also thermal annealing takes place within protoplanetary disks and transform the amorphous silicates into crystalline silicates ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , neither the total spectrum nor the correlated spectra indicate the presence of crystalline silicates .",
    "this is even more surprising considering the high temperatures in the disk interior due to viscous heating of this actively accreting star ( section 7 ) . annealing processes transforming ism amorphous dust into crystalline dust set in in disk regions where @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * )",
    "in addition to that , high accretion rates directly relate to a faster vertical and horizontal mixing within the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "this effect also eases the detection of crystalline silicates within the accretion disk surrounding fu ori .",
    "but why do nt we find any evidence for their existence ?",
    "a possible explanation might be that they simply can not be detected as the related feature is rather weak and simply dominated by the underlying continuum .",
    "this hypothesis can be checked by analyzing the longer wavelength regime of the _ spitzer _ spectrum as shown in figure  [ spectrum_long ] .",
    "as at longer wavelengths the temperature of the continuum is decreasing the contrast between the continuum and possible emission features due to the presence of crystalline silicate particles increases .",
    "hence , spectral signatures of these particles should be more easily detectable .",
    "figure  [ spectrum_long ] , however , shows that also between 14 and 34@xmath0 m the spectrum of fu ori does not show any clear signs of crystalline silicates .",
    "normally crystalline forsterite particles have emission bands at 16.4 , 23.9 , 27.7 and 33.8@xmath0 m and enstatite grains show features at 18.8 , 21.5 , and 24.5@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "if one argued that possibly around 27.7 - 27.8@xmath0 m a weak forsterite feature was present one should keep in mind that the features at 23.9 and 33.8@xmath0 m are normally stronger @xcite but are not seen at all .",
    "thus , also the longer wavelength mir spectrum of fu ori shows that crystalline silicates are not present .",
    "this shows that apparently the non - detection is at least not only due to contrast problems between the emission features and the underlying continuum .    what else can prevent us from detecting crystalline silicates ? in case",
    "fu ori underwent its first ( of possible multiple ) outburst(s ) and phase(s ) of enhanced accretion , it is possible that not enough time has yet elapsed for the crystalline silicate particles to reach the disk surface from where they can be detected by means of mir spectroscopy .",
    "this hypothesis is , however , questionable as the large sizes of the amorphous silicates indicate that enough time , at least for dust coagulation , has elapsed .",
    "recently , @xcite found that assuming the crystallization by thermal annealing happens at the very early phases of disk evolution , the level of crystallinity is linked to the properties of the molecular cloud core from which the disk formed .",
    "it was found that rapidly rotating cores produce rather massive disks with a high accretion rate but a low level of crystallinity . as we observe these properties for fu ori the proposed model ,",
    "although yet very simple and with limited predictive power , might provide an interesting way to explain at least partly the lack of crystalline silicates in the fu ori accretion disk . finally , another possibility might be that the vertical and radial mixing within the disk does not work as efficient as expected . in consequence",
    "not enough crystalline dust grains reach the disk surface at radii where also the contrast between the emission feature and the dust continuum allows their detection .      the results from the correlated flux allow a comparison to disks around other ysos that have also been observed with vlti / midi .",
    "not only seem crystalline silicates be commonly present in protoplanetary disks , but for three intermediate - mass haebes stars @xcite found that the degree of crystallization within the disk depends on the distance from the central star .",
    "the inner parts of the disks are more crystalline than the outer disk regions .",
    "this can naturally be explained by assuming that in the inner disk regions where the disk has higher temperatures dust processing and annealing occurs and that over time crystalline particles are transported outwards .",
    "not only for intermediate mass stars but also for the ttauri star ry tau the same radial dependence of the crystallinity was observed @xcite .",
    "thus , crystalline silicates should in general be more easily detectable in the correlated spectra of protoplanetary disks . for reasons mentioned in the previous section it seems thus surprising that the disk around fu orionis does not seem to contain any detectable amount of crystalline dust .    as described in the introduction fuors",
    "are believed to be low - mass or ttauri - like stars in a state of enhanced accretion . from sub - millimeter and millimeter observations",
    "@xcite concluded that fuors are possibly in an evolutionary youger age than classical ttauri stars .",
    "this younger age is also supported by theoretical models where the protostellar disk is continuously replenished by a dusty envelope .",
    "this material infall on the disk can lead to thermal instabilities in the disk and thus provides a possible mechanism for explaining the observed outbursts @xcite .",
    "the puzzling thing is now that apparently in the disk surrounding fu ori the amorphous grains have already grown considerably .",
    "hence , the disk can not be in its native dust composition and might already have a significant age .",
    "furthermore , from the _ spitzer _ feps ( _ formation and evolution of planetary systems _ ) legacy program it is known that apparently the amount of crystalline silicates in ttauri disks is not correlated with the average size of amorphous dust particles @xcite . hence , crystalline dust particles are created in the _ early _ phases of disk evolution where the accretion rate and the disk temperature are thought to be higher .",
    "if thus the fuor - phase is indeed common to most / all ttauri stars then the non - detection of crystalline particles can not be explained in the current picture of protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "the present paper is more intended to show the observational results rather than to present a sophisticated disk model possibly able to match the observed sed and visibilities with highest accuracy .",
    "thus , instead of applying a complex radiative transfer model we decided to use in a first step a simple analytical disk model . in this model the effective temperature and also the surface density are prescribed by the following broken power law distributions    @xmath38    @xmath39    for the temperature law the temperature at 1 au and the exponent @xmath40 are free parameters . for the surface density",
    "the total disk mass @xmath41 and the exponent @xmath42 are free parameters .",
    "as the integrated surface density must equal the total mass of the disk the radial dependence of the surface density @xmath43 can be computed .",
    "the shape of the total sed ( and finally also the observed visibilities ) require a double power - law to fit the data . at a radius of 3",
    "au the temperature and surface density distribution change . however , we made sure that for both parameters the transition was smooth and continuous .",
    "figure  [ sed ] shows the sed and the resulting fit from the simple disk model .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table  [ model_parameter ] .",
    "based on the value for the visual extinction @xmath44 we interpolated the extinction for the other wavelengths following the findings of @xcite .",
    "the disk inclination @xmath15 was derived from the ellipses fitted to the fwhm of assumed gaussian brightness distributions ( see section 5.3 . ) .",
    "for the position angle @xmath45 we used two values : one was also derived in section 5.3 . , and",
    "for the second one we fitted the disk model to the observed visibilities with @xmath45 being the only free parameter ( see also section 7.2 . ) .",
    "it is clear that this simple approach is not able to reproduce all features of the sed ( e.g. , the weak silicate emission feature ) . for the moment , however , we restrict ourselves to this simple approach and , as mentioned above , a detailed modeling is left for further investigations .",
    "it is striking that rather high disk temperatures are required to fit the sed . in the inner 0.35 au",
    "no dust can withstand the high temperatures @xmath461500 k even on the disk surface and only the gaseous disk component can survive .",
    "it is interesting to note that the power law index of @xmath47 of the inner disk region equals exactly that what was derived in analytical disk models for geometrically flat , optically thick _ passive _ disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as for flat , steady state , optically thick _ accretion _ disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , from the temperature distribution alone one can not distinguish between the two different cases ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in the context of fu ori the passive disk model where the disk is merely re - processing radiation from the central star is unlikely and only an accretion disk model matches most observations @xcite .",
    "a nice example is the recently detected magnetic field in the innermost regions of the disk surrounding fu ori which can only be explained in the picture of a heavily accreting disk @xcite . as the disk temperature",
    "is directly related to the mass accretion rate @xmath48 in classical accretion disk models it is possible to derive the @xmath48 required to produce the observed high temperatures .",
    "@xcite analyzed the effective disk temperature and also the midplane temperature of an accretion disk as a function of the mass accretion rate .",
    "figure 1 of their paper shows that one needs @xmath49 to get close to the effective temperature we find in our model .",
    "such high values for @xmath48 were also found by @xcite and @xcite . due to the high accretion rate the midplane temperature of the disk in the inner @xmath2010 au",
    "is even much higher than the effective disk temperature @xcite .",
    "concerning the temperature law farther out than 3 au the value we adopt here for @xmath50 is in good agreement to what can be found in the literature for isothermal flared disks @xcite . in their model",
    "the index value diverges from the flat solution where @xmath51 at a certain point in the inner disk and approaches @xmath52 for radii much larger than the stellar radius . at intermediate radii",
    "the temperature index might be approximated by values in between these most extreme cases depending on the actual flaring of the disk .    in summary",
    ", the temperature distribution indicates that in the innermost disk regions the disk luminosity is accretion dominated whereas further out it is irradiation dominated .",
    "this is expected for an active accretion disk since the luminosity released by accretion is a much steeper function of distance to the star than that by absorption of radiation from the central star and the hot innermost disk regions ( @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 , roughly ) .        for this simple disk model",
    "it is straightforward to compute the visibilities as a function of projected baseline and wavelength .",
    "assuming that each part of the disk surface is emitting as a blackbody with an effective temperature @xmath55 the corresponding total flux and visibility for an axisymmetric face - on disk is given by ( see also equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and following in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath56    @xmath57dr\\ ] ]    with @xmath58 being the flux , @xmath59 the planck function , @xmath60 the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind , @xmath61 the projected baseline and @xmath62 the distance to the object .    taking into account the inclination of the disk and the position angle",
    "as given in table  [ model_parameter ] we computed the corresponding visibilities for the three different baselines .",
    "the results for two different position angles are shown in figure  [ model_visi ] . in the upper panel the disk inclination and the position angle are derived from the ellipses fitting in section 5.3 . in the lower panel",
    "the position angle was fitted to the observed visibilities with a least squares fit .",
    "while the ellipse fitting yielded a position angle of 109.1@xmath6311.6@xmath64 a least square analysis leads to a value of 93.4@xmath636.8@xmath64 . from the plots in figure  [ model_visi ]",
    "one can see that changing the position angle mostly affects the visibility of the shortest baseline while the curves for the other baselines change only marginally .",
    "fitting the ut3-ut4 baseline proofs quite a challenge as the observed visibility is increasing over the 8 - 13@xmath0 m wavelength interval while all other modeled visibilities are decreasing . especially for this baseline",
    "better fits are expected from more sophisticated disk models . however , given the simplicity of the current models the fits seems in reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "it clearly shows that interferometric measurements can put additional constraints on the structure and geometry of circumstellar disks that can not be derived from sed fitting alone .",
    "interestingly , @xcite were able to fit their nir visibilities of fu ori with a similar disk model and also with a disk and an embedded `` hot spot '' .",
    "they concluded that the latter model was more likely based on statistical arguments .",
    "the major differences between their models and ours is that ( 1 ) they fit the sed with single power laws for the temperature neglecting the flux longwards of 20@xmath0 m and ( 2 ) their best fits yield disk position angles of 47@xmath65 and 8@xmath66 .",
    "the inclination angles ( 55@xmath67 and 48@xmath68 , respectively ) , are in good agreement with our value . in figure  [ malbetmodels ]",
    "we compare both of their models to our observations .",
    "we find that both models fit the midi visibilities not as good as the model presented here .",
    "even more we find that our mir interferometric measurements rule out their first model of a simple accretion disk .",
    "this model predicts a higher visibility for the ut3-ut4 baseline than for the ut2-ut3 baseline which is not observed .",
    "the model with an embedded `` hot spot '' in the accretion disk shows the right trend for the visibilities , but the values for the ut3-ut4 and ut2-ut4 baseline are higher than for our models which already give slightly too high values compared to the observations .",
    "the main reason for the higher visibilities resulting from the model applied by @xcite is the single power law approach which provides less mir flux compared to our models .",
    "we also compared our models to the measured nir visibilities from @xcite .",
    "we restricted ourselves to those observations where the object was clearly resolved .",
    "the results are given in table  [ table_nirvisi ] .",
    "except for the observations done with north - west baseline of the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti / nw ) both of our models agree with the nir visibilities within the error bars .",
    "concerning the predicted `` hot spot '' in the accretion disk @xcite our observations do not yield new insights into its nature as they do not have the required spatial resolution to confirm its existence .",
    "also the calibrated phase of our observations do not contain any information on which basis we could speculate about this possible second companion .",
    "we presented the first multi - baseline mir interferometric observations of fu orionis with midi / vlti .",
    "the findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "fu orionis was clearly resolved in the mir with two vlti baselines and marginally resolved with a third baseline indicating the presence of warm dusty material surrounding fu ori out to several tens of au .",
    "the inclination and the position angle of the accretion disk can be inferred from multi - baseline measurements with midi / vlti .",
    "thus , the instrument provides means for deriving disk parameters that are otherwise only poorly constrained from models and sed fits .",
    "the correlated flux indicates that 95% of the 8 - 13@xmath0 m flux comes from within the inner 25au of the disk for the shortest of our baselines while 65% of this flux arise from the inner 13au for our longest baseline .",
    "the shapes and strengths of the total 8 - 13@xmath0 m spectrum and the ( spatially resolved ) correlated spectra indicate that most dust particles within the accretion disk are amorphous and already significantly larger than typical particles in the ism .",
    "no spectra , neither the total nor the spatially resolved correlated spectra bear significant traces of crystalline silicates . given the high accretion rate and disk temperature of the system this is unexpected and requires further investigations .",
    "the sed and the observed mir visibilities can be fitted reasonably well with a simple analytical disk model prescribing a broken power law for the effective temperature distribution of the protoplanetary disk . within the innermost 3au",
    "the temperature decreases with @xmath69 , farther out the temperature goes with @xmath70 .",
    "the derived power law index for the inner regions is equal to what is derived theoretically for flat , steady state , optically thick accretion disks @xcite . for the outer disk region",
    "the derived value is in good agreement to what can be found for isothermal flared disks @xcite .",
    "7 .   based on points 4 . and 5 . and recent spectroscopic observations of protoplanetary disks around ttauri stars and haebes it seems questionable that fu ori is a very young classical ttauri star as the size of amorphous dust grains in combination with the non - detection of crystalline dust contradicts this assumption .",
    "8 .   from the acquisition image n - band aperture photometry could be derived for the companion fu ori s. it shows that this young k - type star has more relative mir excess than fu ori itself hinting at a circumstellar disk with larger flaring angle or smaller disk inclination .      1 .",
    "most of the published nir visibilities of fu ori @xcite do agree with our newly derived disk models .",
    "2 .   our interferometric observations",
    "rule out one out of two disk models for fu ori presented by @xcite . due to the lack of sufficient spatial resolution the presence of the proposed second very close companion",
    "can neither be confirmed nor disproved with the current set of midi data .",
    "3 .   in contrast to nir interferometric observations of other fuors @xcite our data do not seem to require the introduction of an extended dusty structure providing additional uncorrelated flux .",
    "4 .   for the inner 3au",
    "we require a significantly different disk model ( e.g. , @xmath71 , @xmath69 ) to fit our visibilities and sed in comparison to what was found for the outbursting star v1647 ori ( @xmath72 , @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "although the present results provide important new insights into the fu ori system new questions arose as well .",
    "future investigations will include a more thorough and detailed modeling of the observations with numerical radiative transfer disk models .",
    "these models will not only need to consider the high accretion rates but also such effects as self - irradiation of the disk .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether these models are able to confirm the apparent rotation of the disk s position angle with wavelength and whether they can reproduce the increasing visibility curve for the ut3-ut4 baseline .",
    "also , these disk models will have to reproduce the observed nir and mir visibilities simultaneously with higher accuracy than the current simple models are able to do . from the observational side re - measuring",
    "the ut3-ut4 baseline might be eligible and any other new baseline configuration will certainly help to constrain the disk geometry ( especially the position angle ) even better . concerning the dust structure",
    "the lack of crystalline silicates needs to be analyzed in greater detail .",
    "is it still just a contrast effect that we do not see any crystalline features in the spectra or are they simply not there ?",
    "eventually we will have to face the problem that currently all fuors that have been observed with high spatial resolution techniques draw a rather inhomogeneous picture of the group .",
    "apparently , some are still surrounded by nearby dense envelopes while for others the circumstellar disks suffice to explain the observations . however , even those disk - systems ( i.e. , fu ori and v1647 ori ) seem to be different in terms of physical properties as different temperature and surface density profiles are derived .    without any doubt interferometric observations of circumstellar disks in the nir and mir provide an unprecedented means for deriving geometrical disk properties and put new constraints on the physical ( and also chemical ) processes taking place within protoplanetary disks . and as more and more interferometric data of circumstellar disks are published our view on the cradle of planetary systems will be once more refined .    s. p.",
