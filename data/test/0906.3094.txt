    "the recent interest in quantum random walks and quantum search algorithms is fuelled by the discovery that wave systems can perform certain tasks more efficiently than classical algorithms .",
    "leaving aside issues about the implementation of such algorithms , it is essentially wave interference which acts here as an additional resource .",
    "the prime example is _",
    "s search algorithm @xcite which performs a search in a data - base of @xmath2 items in @xmath0 steps whereas classical search algorithms need of order @xmath2 steps .    in grover",
    "s algorithm it is assumed that one can act on all data points directly . in many physical situations , interactions between points in the network may be restricted and the search can only take place between nodes which are directly connected .",
    "classical search algorithms are then typically based on ( weighted ) random walks exploring the network through jumps from one node to another with prescribed probabilities .",
    "the quantum analogue - a quantum random walk - has been introduced recently .",
    "it can be shown that for certain network topologies improvements on transport speed or hitting times compared to classical random walks can be achieved - see @xcite for overviews .",
    "the connection between quantum random walks and quantum graph theory @xcite has been pointed out in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "quantum random walk algorithms have been introduced which lead to speed - up in a spatial search on an @xmath3-dimensional regular grid ; a continuous - time version of such a quantum search algorithm has been given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , an algorithm for a search on the @xmath3 dimensional hypercube has been presented ; we will focus on this algorithm in what follows , reinterpreting and generalising the results in @xcite as well as giving improved estimates for the search time .",
    "+ the discrete time search algorithms listed above have in common that they are based on quantum walks on regular ( quantum ) graphs @xcite .",
    "the quantum walk itself is defined by a regular graph , a quantum coin flip ( equivalent to a local scattering matrix at each vertex ) , and a shift operation @xcite .",
    "a marked vertex is then introduced in the form of a local perturbation of the quantum random walk .",
    "typically , this is achieved by modifying the coin flip at this vertex ; the quantum search algorithm will localise at the target vertex after @xmath4 time steps .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : first we will introduce the algorithm and give the eigenvalues of the unperturbed walk in terms of a unitary propagator @xmath5 .",
    "then we will introduce a symmetry reduced space and proceed to the spectrum of a quantum search algorithm @xmath6 ; here , @xmath7 characterises the perturbation strength at the marked vertex extrapolating between the unperturbed walk ( @xmath8 ) and a maximal perturbation ( @xmath9 ) ; the latter corresponds to the search algorithm in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath6 shows several avoided crossings - each of these crossings can be used to construct a search algorithm in the reduced space",
    ". we will give estimates for the vectors spanning the two - level subsystems at each crossing and derive the leading asymptotics for the search times .",
    "we show in particular that the search algorithm for the central crossing at @xmath9 finds the marked vertex in @xmath10 time steps where @xmath1 and @xmath3 is the dimension of the hypercube .",
    "we will return to the search on the full hypercube space in the last section .",
    "the vertices of the @xmath3-dimensional hypercube can be encoded using binary strings with @xmath3 digits .",
    "all vertices whose strings are equal for all but one digit are connected , as shown in fig .  [ fig:3-d hypercube ] . hence , each vertex is connected to @xmath3 neighbouring vertices .",
    "since the position space has @xmath11 dimensions and the coin space has @xmath3 dimensions , the hilbert space @xmath12 is of size @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the corresponding unit vectors in the position representation as @xmath14 with @xmath15 specifying the direction at each vertex and @xmath16 gives the coordinates of the vertex , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3-d hypercube ] .",
    "we will start from the quantum walk previously defined in @xcite .",
    "a coin flip @xmath17 acting simultaneously on the internal degrees of freedom at all vertices defines the direction in which the walk will be shifted .",
    "the shift operator @xmath18 shifts the walk to neighbouring vertices .",
    "the ( unperturbed ) walk is then given as @xmath19 .",
    "the local coin flip is specified by a unitary coin matrix @xmath20 which connects @xmath3 incoming with @xmath3 outgoing channels at each vertex and acts effectively as a vertex scattering matrix .",
    "we use the uniform distribution in coin space @xmath21 to define the local coin flip on each vertex as @xmath22 . using the tensor product and the identity matrix in position ( vertex ) space , @xmath23 , the global coin flip",
    "is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "the shift operator moves the quantum walk to one of the neighbouring vertices .",
    "the state in @xmath14 is shifted to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the unit vector in direction @xmath27 and hence @xmath28 the relevant eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath19 are @xmath29 @xcite , where the vector @xmath30 consist of @xmath3 entries that can take the values @xmath31 or @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the hamming weight of this vector , i.e.  the sum of all entries .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the @xmath27-th component of @xmath30 .",
    "note that for @xmath36 or @xmath3 the two cases @xmath37 are equivalent .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath38 are @xmath39 times degenerate .",
    "all other eigenvalues of @xmath5 are @xmath40 ; the corresponding eigenvectors are not affected by the perturbation and are related to the spectrum of the coin space , see @xcite .",

    "we now employ this quantum walk to construct a quantum search algorithm .",
    "we mark the target vertex @xmath43 with a different coin flip , that is , we choose a local coin matrix at @xmath43 with @xmath44 . the marked coin acting on the full hilbert space",
    "is then given as @xmath45 this defines a ` perturbed ' quantum walk @xmath46 , which can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a state localised at the marked vertex and uniformly distributed in coin space .",

    "writing the set of vertices as @xmath3-digit strings containing @xmath31s and @xmath32s , @xmath65 is defined as the operation that flips the @xmath68th digit from @xmath69 or @xmath70 , respectively , and @xmath66 is the operator exchanging the @xmath68th and the @xmath71th digit . note that @xmath65 changes the hamming weight of the vertex whereas @xmath66 does not .",

    "both operators represent reflections at an @xmath72 dimensional manifold orthogonal to @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , where @xmath73 is defined as the unit vector pointing in the @xmath68th direction .",
    "let us assume that the marked vertex sits at @xmath75 .",
    "such a perturbation breaks all symmetries created by @xmath65 .",
    "the marked vertex ( with coin @xmath50 ) is , however , at a fixed point of @xmath66 and the corresponding symmetries are not affected by the perturbation . as a result ,",
    "not all symmetries of the unperturbed spectrum are lifted and the analysis can be done in a symmetry reduced space .    in particular ,",
    "all eigenvectors of @xmath5 orthogonal to @xmath76 are also eigenvectors of @xmath6 and their corresponding eigenvalues remain unchanged when varying @xmath7 in ( [ ulam ] ) . since these eigenvectors are not affected by the perturbation introduced by the marked vertex , we concentrate our investigation on eigenvectors that are not orthogonal to @xmath76 .",
    "we reorganise the eigenvectors such that there is only one eigenvector in each degenerate eigenspace which is not orthogonal to @xmath76 .",
    "these vectors are given by @xmath77 which after normalisation yields @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the coordinates of the marked vertex @xmath43 ; this definition is not independent of @xmath43 . in the following",

    "we discuss the general case in sec .",

    "the numerical results indicate that the eigenphases @xmath94 of the unperturbed walk , corresponding to @xmath8 or 2 and given in eqn .",

    "we will concentrate on the perturber state @xmath96 causing an avoided crossing at @xmath97 and @xmath64 ; this is called the @xmath98-th crossing .    the dynamics at an avoided crossing can essentially be described in terms of a two level system where the interaction induced by the map @xmath62 between the states at the crossing is much larger than that with any of the other unperturbed eigenstates . at the @xmath88-th crossing at @xmath99 , say , we can construct a two - level dynamics between the unperturbed eigenvector @xmath100 given in ( [ eigenfred ] ) and a perturber state @xmath101 to be determined below .",
