    "active studies of plasma wakefield acceleration initiated by @xcite for laser drivers and @xcite for electron ones have reached a point where quality of accelerated beams comes to the fore .",
    "various injection techniques are now under investigation in search of reliable ways of producing low - emittance low - energy spread electron beams , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "one promising technique is side injection of a low energy electron bunch to the wakefield at some small angle .",
    "this method was first proposed by @xcite to increase trapping efficiency by taking advantage of a specific wave nonlinearity .",
    "later , injection at an angle was theoretically studied by @xcite as a cure for ponderomotive scattering and deleterious effects on the vacuum - plasma transition .",
    "recently , side injection has found application in proton driven wakefield acceleration @xcite as the means to save electrons from scattering at early stages of driver evolution in the plasma .",
    "the theory of side injection is still a long way from completion .",
    "it is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "the one - dimensional hamiltonian approach of @xcite helps to some extent to identify rough scalings , but quantitative results necessarily rely on simulations . in this paper",
    "we make a step toward creation of a two - dimensional trapping theory and formulate necessary conditions for side injected electrons to penetrate into the wakefield .",
    "we assume electrons are injected at a small angle @xmath0 to the direction of driver propagation and show that there is an optimum value of this angle .",
    "we first formulate the necessary mathematical framework for particle beam - driven wakes ( section  [ pwfa ] ) , as there is a universal field asymptotic in this case . in section  [ penetr ]",
    "we analyze the equation obtained and find unified laws of electron penetration into the wakefield . in section  [ lwfa ]",
    "we generalize the formalism to laser - driven wakes .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath1 with the drive beam propagating along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the wakefield is assumed axisymmetric and unchanged in time in the driver reference frame .",
    "this assumption is justified if electron trapping occurs at a much shorter time scale than the time of driver evolution , which is typically the case .",
    "the phase velocity of the wakefield is @xmath3 , the relativistic factor is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light .",
    "the geometry of the problem is shown in figure  [ fig1-geom ] .",
    "electrons initially form a stream of the velocity @xmath6 directed to axis .",
    "we use the co - moving coordinate @xmath7 and do not lorentz transform the fields into the moving frame . in new coordinates , electrons move backward and radially with velocity components @xmath8 as far as the side injection is usually aimed at further acceleration of electrons , we assume @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "electron energies discussed in the context of side injection mostly fall in the range 315 mev @xcite , and usually the condition @xmath11 is fulfilled , where @xmath12 . as we show below , for the optimum angle the stronger condition @xmath13 must be fulfilled , and we use this to neglect the angular dependence of the longitudinal velocity : @xmath14    the force exerted on an axially moving relativistic electron is the gradient of the wakefield potential energy @xmath15 .",
    "side injected electrons either fall into the potential well of the wakefield , or are reflected radially by a potential hump .",
    "the initial energy @xmath16 of electron transverse motion is determined by the radial momentum @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron mass , @xmath19 for small @xmath0 , this energy contains the product of two small parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath20 ) and is much smaller than height of any potential hump in wakefield structures of interest .",
    "consequently , the choice of whether electron enters the wakefield or is reflected radially is made at large radii .",
    "once an electron is trapped by the potential well , its radial velocity quickly increases , and the electron approaches the axis with little change in @xmath21-coordinate .",
    "thus we are interested in potential behavior at large radii where important characteristics of trapping are determined .    for the particle driver of charge density @xmath22 and the linearly responding plasma ,",
    "the wakefield potential energy is @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 \\ , d\\xi',\\ ] ] @xmath26 @xmath27 is the plasma density , @xmath28 is the elementary charge , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are zeroth order modified bessel functions . at large radii and behind the driver , formulae ( [ e4])([e6 ] )",
    "take the universal form @xmath31 with the amplitude @xmath32 and phase @xmath33 determined by the individual driver shape .",
    "setting @xmath34 by the choice of origin and using the asymptotic form of bessel function @xmath30 , we simplify the potential energy to @xmath35 separation of incident electrons into trapped and reflected fractions occurs at some radius @xmath36 which we define later",
    ". denote @xmath37 .",
    "then , in the vicinity of @xmath38 , we can write @xmath39 equations of electron motion in the potential ( [ e9 ] ) are @xmath40 @xmath41 here we neglect the change of total electron energy since it happens on much longer timescales",
    ". equations ( [ e10])([e11 ] ) can be combined into one : @xmath42 \\ , e^{-k_p ( r - r_0)}.\\ ] ] introducing dimensionless variables @xmath43 we rewrite equation ( [ e12 ] ) in a universal form : @xmath44 this equation must be solved with initial conditions corresponding to electron arrival from large @xmath45 with the negative dimensionless velocity @xmath46",
    "equation ( [ e14 ] ) can be easily solved numerically for any values of initial velocity @xmath47 and phase @xmath48 . for low initial velocities ,",
    "all electrons are reflected by the outer region of the wakefield [ figure  [ fig2-traj](a ) ] . for larger @xmath47",
    ", there are two types of electron trajectories [ figure  [ fig2-traj](b ) ] . depending on the phase , electrons either penetrate the wakefield , or are reflected .",
    "the electrons entered into the wakefield are quickly accelerated radially and stick to some phase @xmath49 .",
    "this is exactly the phase of the wakefield into which the injection of electrons occurs .",
    "( _ a _ ) and @xmath50 ( _ b _ ) .",
    "lower graphs show the location of potential wells and humps . ]",
    "( _ a _ ) and total penetration efficiency @xmath51 as the function of the initial velocity @xmath47 ( _ b _ ) .",
    "the lower graph shows the location of potential wells and humps . ]     of trapped electrons as the function of final phase @xmath49 for different values of the initial velocity @xmath47 .",
    "thin line is the flux density of incoming electrons .",
    "the lower graph shows the location of potential wells and humps . ]    general picture of electron penetration is shown in figure  [ fig3-map](a ) .",
    "electrons can not enter the wakefield at phases and initial velocities marked by the white color .",
    "the darker the color the greater the flux density @xmath52 of entered electrons , i.e. the number of electrons trapped in the unit interval of @xmath49 divided by the number of incoming electrons passing through a unit interval of @xmath53 at large radii .",
    "the total penetration efficiency @xmath51 ( into all phases ) is shown in figure  [ fig3-map](b ) .",
    "the penetration threshold is observed at @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , not only more than half the electrons penetrate into the wakefield , but also the electron flux density increases several times ( figure  [ fig4-cut ] ) . in other words ,",
    "injection of electrons preferably occurs into a certain phase of the wakefield , and this phase depends on the dimensionless radial electron velocity @xmath47 .",
    "penetration of an electron into the wakefield does not mean this electron is trapped by the wakefield .",
    "the initial radial velocity of the electron can be too high , or the energy gained by the electron in near - axis regions can be insufficient for trapping . in these cases , the electron crosses the axis and leaves the wakefield on the opposite side . the lower the initial radial velocity of the electron , the easier the electron to be trapped .",
    "consequently , there is an optimum angle of electron injection corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "it is just above the penetration threshold : @xmath57 if the relativistic factor of the wave is much greater that that of the electron , @xmath58 , then we obtain the engineering formula @xmath59 for @xmath60 , the optimum angle is even smaller .",
    "estimate ( [ e17 ] ) justifies the condition @xmath13 and formula ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "as we see from figure  [ fig2-traj ] , separation of incident electrons occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "let us find the corresponding dimensional radius @xmath38 .",
    "substituting @xmath62 and @xmath63 into definition of @xmath45 ( [ e13 ] ) , we find @xmath64 using approximation ( [ e8 ] ) for @xmath65 , assuming @xmath58 , and limiting ourselves to the logarithmic accuracy , we obtain a quick estimate for the reflection radius : @xmath66",
    "for laser drivers , there is no universal asymptotic form of the wakefield potential at large radii .",
    "the wakefield potential energy is determined by the vector potential of the driver @xmath67 @xcite : @xmath68 \\ , d\\xi ' , \\qquad      { \\bf a } = \\frac{e{\\bf a}}{m c^2}.\\ ] ] usually @xmath69 follows the same radial dependence as @xmath70 does .",
    "this dependence does not necessarily have an exponential asymptotic at large radii .",
    "nevertheless , the results of section  [ penetr ] are still applicable to laser driven fields though with a lower accuracy .",
    "we can approximate the potential energy in the vicinity of separation radius @xmath38 by the proper exponent function : @xmath71 for example , for a gaussian driver of the radius @xmath72 we have @xmath73 as far as @xmath74 , equation ( [ e12 ] ) , definition of @xmath45 ( [ e13 ] ) , and the initial velocity ( [ e15 ] ) need to be modified : @xmath75 \\ , e^{-\\lambda ( r - r_0)}.\\ ] ] @xmath76 in newly defined variables , equation ( [ e14 ] ) remains unchanged , as are the results of section  [ penetr ] presented in figures  [ fig2-traj][fig4-cut ] .",
    "we need to modify only expression ( [ e16 ] ) for @xmath77 and equation ( [ e18 ] ) for @xmath38 : @xmath78",
    "let us summarize the main findings .",
    "there is an optimum angle for side injection of electrons into the plasma wakefield , as is given by formulae ( [ e16 ] ) or ( [ e4 - 6 ] ) . at smaller angles ,",
    "all electrons are reflected back . at larger angles ,",
    "electrons enter the wakefield with superfluous transverse momentum that is unfavorable for trapping .    penetration efficiency and the wakefield phase into which electrons enter are determined by the field behavior at large radii . in most cases",
    ", the wakefield there decays exponentially , and the process of electron entrance into the wakefield can be studied in a unified way ."
