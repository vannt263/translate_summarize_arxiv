    "the word anomalous means that the exponents @xmath10 deviates from the linear behaviour predicted by a direct scaling analysis of ( [ pde ] ) .",
    "it was first realised by kraichnan @xcite that anomalous scaling can be observed in the mathematically more tractable case of the advection by a random homogeneous and isotropic gaussian velocity field , which is delta correlated ( white noise ) in time and has zero average and covariance in @xmath11 dimensions given by : @xmath12 .",

    "the scaling exponent @xmath13 is a free parameter characterising the degree of turbulence of the advecting field .",
    "the physically meaningful values range from zero to two . in the first limit",
    "the effect of the random advection is just to define an effective diffusion constant @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the velocity increments are smooth as it is expected for a laminar flow .",
    "the choice @xmath13 equal to four thirds represents the scaling of the velocity field conjectured by kolmogorov for the solution of the navier - stokes equation in turbulent rgime .",
    "the hypothesis of delta correlation in time is of great mathematical advantage for it allows to write the equation of motions of the scalar correlations in a linear closed form .",
    "the evolution of each correlation in the inertial range is specified by a linear differential operator , the inertial operator , plus matching conditions at the boundary of the inertial range .",
    "the occurrence of anomalous scaling has been related to the existence of zero modes of the inertial operators dominating the scaling properties of higher order correlations ( @xcite and for a recent review and more complete bibliography @xcite ) .",
    "the behaviour of the anomaly has also been numerically measured for the fourth order structure function versus the turbulence parameter @xmath13 @xcite . however , to implement accurate numerical experiments still remains a difficult task .",
    "therefore it turns out to be useful to use shell model as laboratories to test ideas and results related to the full pde model ( see @xcite for a general introduction to the shell model concept ) . in @xcite two different shell models advected by a delta correlated velocity field mimicking the kraichnan model were constructed .",
    "anomalous scaling was observed numerically and in the simpler case @xcite it was proven analytically that the anomaly of the fourth order structure function is related to the anomalous scaling of the dominant zero mode of the inertial operator .",
    "the passive scalar advection by a white noise velocity field is a useful mathematical model , but it still very far from a physical realistic velocity field which displays both time correlations and non gaussian fluctuations . a first small step in this direction",
    "is made by investigating how the introduction of a time correlation in a gaussian velocity field affects the statistical properties of the scalar field .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce a time correlated velocity field in a shell model .",
    "this is done by substituting the white noise with the ornstein - uhlenbeck process which provides exponentially decaying time correlations ( section  [ s : model ] ) .",
    "we investigate the model both analytically and numerically . by means of stochastic variational calculus , which we shortly review in appendices [ ap : one ] and [ ap : two ] , we show how to rewrite the equations of motion for the scalar correlations in integral non closed form .",
    "such an operation allows the evaluation of the correction to the white noise inertial operator stemming from the time correlated velocity field .",
    "this procedure has the further advantage that it creates a non - ambiguous relation between the coupling terms for the scaling exponent @xmath13 of white noise advection to the scaling exponent @xmath14 of the equal time correlation of the time - correlated velocity field ( section  [ s : closure ] ) .",
    "the inertial operators can be expanded around the white noise limit in powers of an a - dimensional parameter which is interpreted as proportional to the ratio @xmath15 between the time correlation and the turn - over time of the advecting field .",
    "we focus on the features of the steady state .",
    "there we assume that the averages over the ornstein - uhlenbeck process of all the observables are time translational invariant . as a consequence",
    "the inertial operators become linear up to any finite order in @xmath15 .    in the white noise case , when @xmath15 is equal zero , we generalise the procedure first introduced in @xcite and we show that the scaling of the zero modes of the inertial operator of any order is captured by focusing on nearest - shell interactions . the equations are closed with a scaling ansatz ( section [ s : wnclosure ] ) by postulating that the scalar field is `` close '' to a multiplicative process .",
    "furthermore we perturb the closure scheme in order to extract the first order corrections in @xmath15 to the anomalous exponents for different values of @xmath14 ranging from zero to two .",
    "the prediction of perturbation theory is an @xmath15 dependence ( non - universality ) of the exponents except for the second order @xmath16 ( section [ s : perturbative ] ) .",
    "the overall result is analogous to the one obtained in @xcite where a gaussian time correlated velocity field is considered for the advection of the scalar field in ( [ pde ] ) : the introduction of time correlation is seen to enhance intermittency .",
    "the anomalies vanish smoothly in the laminar limit @xmath14 equal two .    to examine the validity of the results from the analytical calculations and explore the regime with long time - correlations ( @xmath17 ) we turned to numerical experiments .",
    "the occurrence of corrections to the anomalies predicted by the perturbation theory for small values of @xmath15 was confirmed .",

    "the parameter @xmath27 is the ratio between two adjacent scales and it is usually taken equal to two in order to identify each shell with an octave of wave numbers .",
    "the energy transfer in a turbulent flow is conjectured to occur mainly through the interactions of eddies of the same size . as a consequence",
    "the interactions in fourier space are assumed to be local . the `` localness '' conjecture @xcite is the motivation for the restriction to nearest neighbours of the couplings among the shells .    in the absence of external forcing and dissipation the total `` energy '' of the passive field",
    "is conserved : @xmath28 far from the infra - red and the ultra - violet boundaries ( i.e. for @xmath29 ) the conservation of energy is expected to hold approximately giving rise to an inertial range . equations ( [ ousde ] ) and ( [ force ] ) describe the random evolution according to ornstein - uhlenbeck ( o - u ) processes respectively of the advecting and external force field .",

    "the known sufficient condition ( see for example @xcite ) to have a solution of ( [ passcomplete ] ) in an analytic exponential form is therefore not satisfied . from the geometrical point of view non - commutativity",
    "means that the dynamics is confined on a manifold which turns into an hyper - sphere in @xmath51 in the inertial limit ( [ energy ] ) .    the complex equations ( [ passcomplete ] ) are invariant under phase transformations . given two diagonal hermitian @xmath52 matrices with time independent random entries @xmath53",

    "that a steady state is reached one matches the scaling of the inertial terms in ( [ passive ] ) with a power law decay of the solution @xmath59 the resulting prediction is a linear behaviour of the exponents versus the order @xmath60 of the diagonal correlation : @xmath61 the scaling argument ( [ matching ] ) neglects completely the random fluctuations of the passive scalar field .",
    "normal scaling holds if the statistics of the @xmath30-field is gaussian .",

    "multiplicative modelling has been shown to account for most of the features observed in real and synthetic turbulence @xcite . in the present case",
    "the idea of a multiplicative structure is incorporated in the hypothesis that the scaling of the non diagonal sector of a given moment of order @xmath83 is reconstructed once the scaling of the lower moments is known .",
    "such an assumption together with the analysis of the couplings in the inertial operator of order @xmath83 yields with fair accuracy the scaling exponents of the model without the resort to an exact diagonalisation of inertial operator .",
    "let us now turn to the time correlated case . the idea is to evaluate the scaling behaviour of the dominant zero modes of the inertial operators ( [ 2omegabyparts ] ) linearised up to first order in @xmath15 by perturbing the white noise closure ansatz .",
    "the first order corrections in @xmath15 to the inertial operators are obtained by truncating the integration by parts to the terms linear in @xmath15 @xmath142 the use of ( [ coeff ] ) in the rhs stresses that the effective a - dimensional expansion parameter is @xmath143 : the range of reliability of first order perturbation theory is compressed to @xmath144 .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ s : closure ] , in the limit @xmath33 going to infinity , one expects two time quantities to be stationary . in such a case the derivative with respect to the variable @xmath88 can be interchanged with the derivative with respect to @xmath33 and one can use the equations of motion to evaluate ( [ correctiongen ] ) .",
    "a direct differentiation with respect to @xmath88 is consistently taken with respect to the system of stochastic differential equations conjugated by time reversal of equations ( [ passive ] ) to ( [ force ] ) .",
    "the latter operation in general requires the knowledge of the probability density of the forward problem . in the stationary limit",
    "the time reversal operation for the o - u process reduces to the inversion of the sign of the drift term as in the deterministic case . after a slightly more lengthy algebra",
    "the result is equal to the differentiation with respect to @xmath33 with opposite sign .",
    "the computations in the general case are very cumbersome ( see appendices  [ ap : fourthorder ] , [ ap : sixthorder ] and [ ap : eightorder ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to exemplify the procedure in the simpler case of the second order correlation .",
    "there are four contributions to @xmath145 : @xmath146 by definition @xmath147 the time derivative of @xmath148 is derived by a simple index shift . as the terms non - diagonal in the resolvent @xmath64 indices are zero , the second moment inertial operator is not by affected by first order perturbation theory .",
    "the result is not surprising .",
    "the second moment has only one free index .",
    "hence at any order of perturbation theory only global coupling can be generated which are forced by the symmetries of the model to be consistent with a normal scaling of the zero mode .",
    "moreover the @xmath149 s components of the scalar evolve only through the coupling with their complex conjugated @xmath150 s : their variation is a second order effect in @xmath15 .",
    "the only possible non zero corrections are viscous and can be consistently neglected .",
    "let us turn to draw the general picture when @xmath60 is larger than one .",
    "once again the phase symmetries ( [ identity ] ) and the fact that when @xmath151 is known all other terms are yielded by index shift or exchange operations , prevent the corrections to the global couplings from affecting the scaling properties : the resulting `` global '' sectors of inertial operators have a normal scaling zero mode .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation made in @xcite , where the dependence of the scaling exponents on the time correlation for generalised models of passive scalar advection is predicted to appear only through anomalies .",
    "the corrections to the purely short range couplings are therefore the relevant ones .",
    "they occur in two ways . on one hand new terms of order @xmath15 show up in the purely self and nearest - neighbours interactions . on the other hand , terms proportional to @xmath152",
    "the latter ones are the most dangerous for they in principle perturb the logic of the white noise closure by introducing new independent equations and henceforth the need for more renormalisation constants in the non diagonal sector of the moments .",
    "nevertheless one can argue a priori in the spirit of the renormalisation group @xcite , only the nearest neighbours interactions are relevant for scaling . hence",
    "first order corrections can be obtained allowing an @xmath15 dependence in the renormalisation constant of the white noise closure and determining the first order coefficient of their taylor expansion .",
    "moreover for @xmath60 larger than two such a strategy is already able to take into account the corrections due to the purely second neighbours interactions .",
    "let us analyse in more detail the case of @xmath153 .",
    "the white noise closure is perturbed by introducing an @xmath15 dependence in the renormalisation constants @xmath154 the marginal scaling in the non - diagonal sector in ( [ 4perturbednondiag ] ) is assumed to stay universal as it is for @xmath155 while the @xmath15 dependence is stored in the pre - factor .",

    "fig : ouanomalfour ] ) the overall anomaly is @xmath159 in the range of reliability of first order perturbation theory the effect is very small : for @xmath160 the prediction is a correction amounting to the three percent of the white noise exponent @xmath139 .",
    "the perturbative scheme just proposed does not take into account the emergence of pure second neighbours interactions . in order to weight their relevance for the diagonal scaling and simultaneously to check the hypothesis of normal scaling for",

    "consistency with the white noise theory imposes the latter equation to decouple when @xmath15 is set to zero .",
    "the requirement is satisfied if the closure is chosen in the form @xmath162 the pre - factor @xmath163 enforces @xmath164 to be a function of the white noise renormalisation constants .",

    "[ fig : ouanomalfour ] the time correlation induced correction to @xmath165 when ( [ secondneighbours ] ) is included has the same qualitative behaviour and is quantitatively very close to the nearest - neighbours prediction .",
    "the result is an a - posteriori check of the robustness of the closure approach .",
    "it confirms that first order corrections can be extracted within the logical scheme of the zero order one .",
    "it follows that the equations specifying the zero modes of the inertial operator acting on the sixth moment ( see appendix  [ ap : sixthorder ] ) can be closed by assuming : @xmath166 the exponent @xmath165 is known perturbatively from ( [ fourperturbed ] ) while @xmath16 is universal . with the same rationale ( appendix  [ ap : sixthorder ] )",

    "is seen to enhance intermittency .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the phenomenon might be obtained by interpreting the time correlation as a mechanism to increase the probability of coherent fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "the latter are rare events felt in the tail of the probability density of the scalar field as extreme deviations from the gaussian behaviour of the typical events .",
    "the resort to numerical experiments has a double motivation .",
    "on one hand they can be used to test the predictions from the first order perturbation theory . on the other hand",
    "they provide a broader scenario of the features of the model beyond the grasp of perturbative approaches .",
    "the first task is far from being easy because a quantitative check of perturbation theory requires measurements of the scaling exponents within an accuracy smaller than two percent .",
    "the main feature of the inertial range is the conservation of the scalar `` energy '' . from the analytical point of view",
    "this is seen in the non - commutativity of the terms associated with the multiplicative noise , @xmath170 in ( [ passcomplete ] ) .",
    "this property rules out the use of a simple euler scheme , which can be applied in the case of delta correlated noise . in the case of white noise advection the multiplicative structure of the noise ( [ passcomplete ] ) , which is interpreted in the stratonovich sense , can be mapped into the corresponding it equations .",
    "the advantage is that the diagonal non zero average part of the noise is explicitly turned into an effective drift term @xcite .",
    "the non - diagonal terms in the taylor expansion of the scalar field @xmath54 are of the order three halves in @xmath171 , which are neglected in the euler scheme .",
    "this procedure becomes meaningless for a time - correlated noise .",
    "there ordinary calculus holds and in the taylor expansion of @xmath54 both diagonal and non - diagonal products of the noise are of the same order in @xmath171 .",
    "moreover the algorithm to be used must tend smoothly to a white noise limit , so that the same relative error is preserved independently on the value of @xmath15 .",

    "this method ensures that the noise is accurate down to the limit @xmath172 .    the relevant time scale to measure",

    "[ fig : contexample2 ] more than @xmath175 eddy - turn - over times are needed to achieve a converged solution for the sixth order structure function .",
    "the time step is set by the fastest time scale in the system , which is the one of the largest shell @xmath176 .",
    "the number of iterations needed to achieve convergence is then for @xmath15 less than one : @xmath177 which shows that the number of iterations needed grows like @xmath178 , making it difficult to get close to the white noise limit using the same algorithm .",
    "the scaling of the diagonal moments of higher order has been extracted by means of extended self - similarity @xcite , where the @xmath98-th order structure function is plotted versus the second order one , which is assumed to be normal .",
    "the scaling is found as the average slope of the logarithmic derivatives in the inertial range .",
    "we considered a system with twenty - five shells with wave numbers increasing as power of @xmath179 , with viscosity @xmath180 .",

    "[ fig : compare ] where the scaling exponents are plotted versus the order of the moments of the scalar field for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "it is evident that the anomaly grows as the time correlation increases .",

    "for the sixth moment this uncertainty turned out to be on the order of a four percent .",
    "the changes in the scaling between different values of @xmath15 is also on the order of a few percent .",
    "this seems to exclude a proper resolution in the numerics to compare the results with the analytical predictions from the perturbation analysis .",
    "however , the results for different values of @xmath15 can still be compared with some confidence , as the relative uncertainty between the different runs is much smaller than the absolute uncertainty .",
    "this means that the slope of , i.e. , the sixth order structure functions vs. @xmath15 will be well resolved , while the absolute values can be shifted up and down a few percent .    in fig .",

    "the slope is the same for the analytical calculation and the numerics , giving credibility to the results of the perturbation analysis .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of time correlation on the anomaly is quantitatively quite small even in the non perturbative range when @xmath15 is equal to one ( @xmath143 equal four ) .",
    "the global picture provided by the numerical experiments is that @xmath182 is seen to be a non linear function of @xmath15 which , after rapid initial decrease in the perturbative range , displays a much slower rate of variation .",
    "an interesting question is whether there is a limiting value of the scaling of the structure function as @xmath183 or not .",
    "however the quality of the numerics does not allow us to answer this question .",
    "we have presented a shell model for the advection of a passive scalar by a velocity field which is exponentially correlated in time .",
    "we developed a systematic procedure to calculate the exponents of the correlation of the diagonal moments ( the structure functions ) .",
    "for the delta correlated velocity we find good agreement between analytical and numerical calculations up to the eight order .",
    "we presented an analytical perturbative theory to compute the correction to the scaling exponents due to the exponentially correlated velocity field .",
    "the occurrence of anomalies in the exponents of the diagonal moments of the scalar and their non universality versus the intensity @xmath184 of the time correlation , is related to the presence of pure short range couplings in the corresponding inertial operator which provide for non trivial scaling of the zero modes . in the absence of such short range couplings , as is the case for the second moment , normal scaling would take place independently on the value of @xmath143 .",
    "the behaviour of the anomalous exponents in the non - perturbative regime was studied numerically .",
    "this was found to be a non linear monotonic function of @xmath143 , decreasing with a rate much slower than in the perturbative regime .",
    "it is thus clear that the addition of the time correlation to the advecting velocity field enhances the anomalous scaling .",
    "the anomaly found in the present study is still much smaller that what is found when the passive scalar is driven by a turbulent velocity field driven by navier - stokes turbulence or by a shell model for the velocity field @xcite .",
