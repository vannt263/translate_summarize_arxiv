    "so far the findings concerning conductivity of dna have been controversial .",
    "there are the results of recent measurements indicating that dna behaves as a well conducting one - dimensional molecular wire @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in contrast it was reported that dna is insulating @xcite and for short oligomers built up from base pairs of the same type semiconductivity was observed @xcite .",
    "this qualitative discrepancy is shared also by theoretical findings so that it remains unclear whether dna is conductive or not .",
    "for example a theoretical investigation based on first principle calculations suggests the absence of dc - conductivity in dna @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there stand the studies using various assumptions for modeling the dna structure which focus on different aspects such as the influence of aperiodicity , temperature driven fluctuations and aggregation effects on the energetic control of charge migration which have all come to the conclusion that dna is a conductor @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the detailed understanding of the conduction mechanism of dna remains still an unsolved task .",
    "different attempts to model the charge transport of dna were based on transport via coherent tunneling @xcite , classical diffusion under the conditions of temperature - driven fluctuations @xcite , incoherent phonon - assisted hopping @xcite,@xcite , variable range hopping between localized states @xcite and charge carriages mediated by polarons @xcite,@xcite and solitons @xcite .    in the present work we use for the theoretical description of charge transport in dna a nonlinear approach facilitating the concept of polaron respectively breather solutions .",
    "the structure of the bent double helix of @xmath0dna is modeled by a sterical network of oscillators in the frame of the base pair picture @xcite,@xcite,@xcite taking into account deformations of the hydrogen bonds within a base pair and twist motions between adjacent base pairs .",
    "the electron motion is described by a tight - binding system .",
    "it is assumed that the electron motion is predominantly influenced by vibrational modes of the double helix .",
    "the nonlinear interaction between the electron and the vibrational modes causes the formation of polarons respectively electron - vibron breathers supporting charge localization and transport .",
    "the aim of the current investigation is to elucidate the role played by static parametrical disorder and complex structural effects due to irregular deviations from the ordered helical shape of the double helix ( reflected in random arrangements of the positions of the bases ) with regard to the charge transport in dna .",
    "there arises at least one interesting question , namely : is long - lived and stable charge transport in dna achievable at all under the impact of disorder ? to tackle this problem in our paper we exploit analytical and numerical methods from the theory of ( nonlinear ) dynamical systems in combination with the theory of ( linear ) disordered systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section we describe the model for the charge transport along the steric structure of the bent dna double helix .",
    "the second section is concerned with the construction of polaron respectively static electron - vibron breather solutions of the nonlinear lattice system when parametrical and structural disorder effects are taken into account . in section [ section : moving ] we discuss the mobility properties of the polarons respectively electron - vibron breathers and their transport efficiency in dependence on the degree of disorder contained in the on - site energies and/or in structural arrangements of the helix . in a subsequent section",
    "we invoke the floquet analysis to explain also the mobility of the polarons and breathers in terms of their spectral properties",
    ". finally , we present a summary and discussion of the results .",
    "dna chains are quite flexible and exhibit structural fluctuations influencing the transport properties .",
    "our model is designed to cover the basic features of the dna double helix structure needed for a proper description of the charge transport dynamics under the impact of fluctuating base motions . despite the fact that the charge transport proceeds across a one - dimensional channel of base stacks spanning along the sugar - phosphate backbone so that dna can effectively be viewed as a one - dimensional molecular wire @xcite some significant details of the three - dimensional dna structure have to be incorporated in the model . for the physical description of dna molecules",
    "their detailed chemical structure can be neglected .",
    "they can be simply considered as bent double - stranded systems with an adequate number of parameters sufficient for modeling the considered physical process . in the frame of simple dna models such as the base pair picture the bases",
    "have been treated as single nondeformable entities .",
    "the helicoidal structure of dna is then conveniently described in a cylindrical reference system where each base pair possesses two degrees of freedom , namely a radial variable measuring the transversal displacements of the base pair ( that is deformations of the h - bond ) and its angle with a reference axis in a plane perpendicular to the helix backbone which defines the twist of the helix @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] we depict schematically the structure of the dna model .    ,",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 and the radial and angular variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively are indicated . ]    with relevance to charge migration the most influential fluctuating motions of dna originate from tranverse vibrations of the bases relative to each other within each base plane , i.e. the base pair distance stretchings / compressions and the torsional variations of the helicoidal twist dominating longitudinal ( acoustic strand ) phonons @xcite because the sugar - phosphate chains are rather stretch proof @xcite .",
    "therefore it is justified to discard the impact of longitudinal vibrations and the considered motion is restricted to the base pair planes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the angular twist and radial vibrational motions evolve independently on two different time scales and can be regarded as decoupled degrees of freedom in the harmonic treatment of the normal mode vibrations of dna @xcite .",

    "@xmath14 is the local electronic energy and @xmath15 stands for the transfer matrix element which is responsible for the transport of the electron along the stacked base pairs .",

    "we emphasize that in the context of charge transport in dna the nonlinear dynamics of large amplitude structural transitions are not of interest because charge transport processes are thought to be mainly facilitated by soft fluctuational vibrational modes allowing the harmonic approximation of their dynamics .",
    "the interaction between the electronic variable and the structure variables @xmath18 and @xmath5 stems from the parameter dependence of the electronic parameters @xmath14 and @xmath23 . the diagonal term expressing the most efficient coupling is of the form @xmath24 and takes into account the modulation of the on - site electronic energy @xmath25 by the radial vibrations of the base pairs .",
    "in turn the actual charge occupation has its impact on the local radial distortion of the helix . as the transfer matrix elements @xmath23 are concerned we assume that they depend on the three - dimensional distance between two consecutive bases along a strand in the following fashion @xmath26 the quantity @xmath27 regulates how strong @xmath23 is influenced by the distance and the latter is determined by @xmath28 with @xmath29 expanding the expression ( [ eq : dist ] ) up to first order around the equilibrium positions",

    "as we switch on the coupling @xmath156 and increase it up to the actual value @xmath147 , we can follow the evolution of the multipliers .",

    "moreover , it should be pointed out that for larger elongations of @xmath5 , beyond the range where the linear expansion of @xmath163 is valid , there exists also an angular pinning mode as a consequence of the coupling between the electronic amplitudes and the angular variables .",
    "the fact that the disorder eventually prevents the polaron from being moved can also be explained with the help of the floquet multipliers . when the degree of disorder is increased the pinning mode eigenvalues move progressively away from @xmath155 towards larger arguments @xmath84 and approach the rest of the @xmath164 eigenvalues .",
    "[ fig : fdisorder ] displays the growth of the arguments of the pinning mode as a function of the disorder strength @xmath65 .",
    "eventually the system is too far away from the instability due to the marginal mode , which appears when the pair of pinning mode eigenvalues collapses at @xmath155 .",
    "this is easy to understand , as the disorder brings about a decoupling of the variables , favoring localized , stationary , isolated modes .     demonstrating the growth of the argument of the pinning mode with increased amount of disorder so that the pinning mode eventually merges in the rest of the modes . ]",
    "in the present work we have studied an electron transfer mechanism in dna relying on the coupling of the charge carrying unit to the vibrational modes of dna responsible for the formation of polarons and electron - vibron breathers . the steric structure of the double helix of @xmath0dna has been described in the context of the base - pair picture considering angular and radial vibrational motions of the base pairs .",
    "we have focused interest on the initiation of long - range and stable polaron and breather motion along the dna structure when static and/or structural disorder inherent to any real dna molecule is taken into account .",
    "we remark that the proposed polaron - like transport mechanism applies to electron hole conduction too . in the first part of the paper we have constructed exact stationary localized solutions ( polarons and static electron - vibron breathers ) with the help of a nonlinear map approach .",
    "we have found that the interplay of disorder and nonlinearity amplifies the degree of localization in comparison with cases when either disorder or nonlinearity alone is present . with concern to mobile electron - vibron breather solutions",
    ", whose motion is activated through a kick mechanism utilizing the pinning mode , with the current work we have demonstrated that they are fairly robust when the electron - vibration system is subjected to randomness .",
    "generally , even for a moderate amount of disorder the breathers retain their localized shapes and support directed , long - ranged coherent electron transfer along strands of the bent double helix .",
    "in particular the last result suggests that dna seems suitable for the design of ( one - dimensional ) functional nanostructures as ingredients of molecular nanoelectronical devices .",
    "furthermore , we have observed that the electron breather is accompanied by vibrational breathers in the radial as well as angular components , respectively causing local and temporal deformations of the traversed region of the double helix . conclusively ,",
    "efficient charge transport in dna proceeds on the condition that the double helix undergoes structural changes which is exemplary for the interplay of structure and function in flexible and adaptive biomolecules .",
