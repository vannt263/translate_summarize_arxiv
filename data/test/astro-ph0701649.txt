    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is the nearest galaxy of the local group with evident star formation activity .",
    "the lmc has a very popolous system of globular clusters that covers a large range of metallicities and ages ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can distinguish an old population , coeval with the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) system , an intermediate ( 1 - 3 gyr ) and a young population , ranging from a few million years to 1 gyr . hence the stellar populations of the lmc cluster system represent an important _ laboratory _ to study and test stellar evolution models in a different age - regime with respect to the galactic system .",
    "the first surveys devoted to study the properties of these clusters have been carried out in the optical @xcite and in the near - infrared @xcite spectral range and were based on measurements of their integrated colours @xcite .",
    "however , only in the last decade the main properties of the resolved stellar populations in lmc globulars have been investigated by means of high resolution photometry of individual stars @xcite .",
    "these works have produced a number of interesting results : ( _ i _ ) the oldest clusters of the lmc are coeval with ggcs @xcite .",
    "the recent _ census _ of the old lmc globulars presented by @xcite counts a total of 15 objects with ages @xmath5 10 gyr ; ( _ ii _ ) the dominant population is constituted of @xmath6100 young and intermediate age clusters , with ages @xmath73 gyr ; ( _ iii _ ) the absence of objects in the huge age range from @xmath63 to @xmath6 13 gyr ( the so - called _ age gap _ ) : the _ age gap _ problem has been largely investigated ( see i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and clusters in the _ age gap _",
    "actively searched @xcite , however up to date , only one candidate , namely eso 121-sc03 , possibly falls in such an age range . in spite of these efforts ,",
    "the overall formation history of the lmc is still an open issue , since a firm age - metallicity relation ( amr ) has not been established , yet .",
    "indeed , homogeneous and accurate metallicities and ages for a significant sample of lmc clusters are mandatory to derive a reliable amr .",
    "accurate ages from the measurement of the main - sequence ( ms ) turn - off ( to ) region are still sparse and very model ( i.e. isochrones ) dependent .",
    "the only homogeneous age - scale available still relies on the so called s - parameter @xcite , an empirical quantity related to the position of the cluster in the dereddened ( u - b ) vs ( b - v ) color - color diagram .",
    "this parameter linearly correlates with the logarithm of the age @xcite .",

    "detailed chemical abundances from high - resolution spectra are still sparse @xcite .    with the ultimate goal of constructing a homogeneous age - metallicity scale for the lmc clusters , we started a program which makes use of the last generation of instruments ( imager and multi - object spectrograph ) in order to perform an appropriate study of stellar population , age , metal content and structural parameters for a number of pillar clusters . in this paper",
    "we present the results for one of the most massive and luminous globulars in the lmc , namely ngc 1978 .",

    "* ) , significantly larger than the one typically measured in stellar clusters @xcite , and ( _ ii _ ) because it has been suspected to harbour a chemically inhomogeneous stellar population @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite has recently presented high resolution spectra for eleven giants in this cluster , obtaining [ fe / h]=-0.38 dex , with a very low dispersion ( @xmath9=0.07 dex ) , firmly excluding the presence of a significant metallicity spread in this cluster . here",
    "we present a high precision cmd of the cluster based on observations obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the morphology and the population ratios along the main evolutionary sequences have been used to quantify the effect of convective overshooting . finally , by combining the precise measure of the ms - to with accurate estimate of the cluster metallicity @xcite we also provide an accurate estimate of the cluster age .",
    "the photometric dataset consists of high - resolution images obtained with acs@hst ( 300 sec and 200 sec long ) through the f555w and f814w filters .",
    "these images have been retrieved from eso / st - ecf science archive ( proposal i d 9891 , cycle 12 ) .",

    "the first chip has been centered on the cluster center , while the second chip sampled a contiguos field .",

    "we interpret this feature as a signature of the major star - formation episode occurred 5 - 6 gyr ago , when lmc and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) were gravitationally bounded @xcite .      in order to quantify the degree of completeness of the final photometric catalog",
    ", we used the well - know artificial star technique @xcite , and simulated a population of stars in the same magnitude range covered by the observed cmd ( excluding stars brighter than @xmath2=17.6 , corresponding to the saturation level ) and with @xmath190.8 mean color .",
    "the artificial stars have been added to the original images and the entire data reduction procedure has been repeated using the _ enriched _ images .",

    "the extended and populated rgb in ngc 1978 gives the possibility to search for the so - called rgb - bump .",
    "this is the major evolutionary feature along the rgb .",
    "it flags the point when the h - burning shell reaches the discontinuity in the h - abundance profile left by the inner penetration of the convection .",
    "this feature has been predicted since the early theoretical models @xcite but observed for the first time in a globular cluster almost two decades later @xcite . since that first detection",
    "the rgb - bump was identified in several ggcs @xcite and in a few galaxies in the local group ( sextant @xcite , ursa minor @xcite , sagittarius @xcite ) . accordingly with the prescriptions of @xcite , we have used the differential and integrated luminosity function ( lf ) to identify the magnitude level of the rgb - bump in ngc 1978 . in doing this , we have _ ( 1 ) _ selected stars belonging to the brightest ( @xmath1320.6 ) portion of the rgb ; _ ( 2 ) _ carefully excluded the bulk of the he - clump and agb stars by eye ; _ ( 3 ) _ defined the fiducial ridge line for the rgb , rejecting those stars lying at more than 2@xmath9 from the ridge line .",
    "4 shows the final rgb sample ( more than 600 stars ) and both the differential and integrated lfs .",
    "the rgb - bump appears in the differential lf as a well defined peak at @xmath22 and it is confirmed in the integrated lf as a evident change in the slope .    for both lfs the assumed bin - size is 0.1 mag ; in order to check the uncertainty in the bump magnitude level , we have tested the position of this feature by using lfs computed with different binning .",
    "the impact of the selected bin - size is not crucial : a difference of 0.2 mag corresponds to a variation @xmath70.05 mag in the detection of rgb bump . by considering the intrinsecal width of the peak in differential lf",
    ", we estimate a conservative error @xmath70.10 mag .",
    "finally , we note that the rgb bump is brighter and reddest than of the bulk of the he - clump and the latter merges into the rgb at faintest magnitude ( @xmath1219.3 , see fig .",
    "4 ; hence the possibility of contamination is negligible .",
    "most globular clusters in the galaxy show a nearly spherical shape , with a mean ellipticity=1-(b / a ) , where a and b represent major and minor axis of the ellipse , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath8=0.07 @xcite and more than 60% with @xmath230.10 .",
    "one of the most remarkable exception is represented by @xmath24 centauri that is clearly more elliptical than the other ggcs : its ellipticity is @xmath8=0.15 in the external regions with a evident decrease in the inner regions , with @xmath8=0.08 @xcite .",
    "conversely , the lmc clusters ( as well as those in the smc ) show a stronger departure from the spherical simmetry . @xcite",
    "estimated the ellipticities of 25 popolous lmc clusters , finding a mean value of @xmath8=0.22 ; @xcite obtained a lower average value for the lmc clusters ( @xmath8=0.14 ) , but still higher than the mean ellipticity of the ggcs .",
    "moreover , in the lmc the presence of many double or triple globular clusters has been interpretated as a clue of the possibility of merger episodes between subclusters with the result to create stellar clusters with high ellipticities @xcite .",
    "+ previous determinations @xcite suggested large values of ellipticity for ngc 1978 .    we have used the acs catalog to derive a new measurement of the ellipticity of the cluster , in doing this we computed isodensity curves and adopting an adaptive kernel technique , accordingly to the prescription of @xcite . in doing this",
    "we have adopted the center of gravity of the cluster computed using the near - infrared photometry obtained with sofi @xcite .",
    "the isodensity curves have been computed using all the stars in the first chip with @xmath1322 ( approximately two magnitudes below the to region ) in order to minimize the incompleteness effects .",

    "no evidence of subclustering or double nucleus is found . the average value of the ellipticity results @xmath8=0.30 ( with a root mean square of 0.02 ) , without any radial trend .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the previous estimates @xcite and confirms the surprisingly high ellipticity of ngc 1978 .",
    "the determination of the age of a stellar population requires an accurate measure of the ms to and the knowledge of the distance modulus , reddening and overall metallicity . for ngc 1978",
    "we used the recent accurate determination of [ fe / h]=-0.38@xmath25 dex @xcite and @xmath26>$ ] almost solar ( mucciarelli et al . , in preparation ) , based on high - resolution spectra , to derive the overall metallicity [ m / h ] . in doing this , we adopted the relation presented by @xcite : @xmath27\\sim[fe / h]+\\log{(0.694\\cdot10^{<[\\alpha / fe]>}+0.306)},\\ ] ] obtaining [ m / h]@xmath6 -0.37 dex . + in the case of intermediate age stellar systems , the measurements of the age is complicated by the presence of a convective core , whose size needs to be parametrized ( @xmath3).=1/@xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is pressure scale height ) that quantifies the overshoot distance _ above _ the schwarzschild border in units of the pressure scale height .",
    "some models as the `` padua ones '' define this parameter as the overshoot distance _ across _ the schwarzschild border , hence the @xmath3 values from different models are not always directly comparable . ] we then use different sets of theoretical isochrones with different input physics , in order to study the impact of the convective overshooting in reproducing the morphology of the main evolutionary sequences in the cmd .    * * basti models * : basti ( _ a bag of stellar tracks and isochrones _ ) evolutionary code described in @xcite computes isochrones with and without the inclusion of overshooting .",

    "note that this value corresponds to @xmath34 0.25 in the other models , where the extension of the convective region ( beyond the classical boundary of the schwarzschild criterion ) is measured with respect to the convective core border .",
    "+      from each set of theoretical models , we selected isochrones with z=0.008 ( corresponding to [ m / h]=-0.40 dex ) , consistent with the overall metallicity of the cluster and we assumed a distance modulus @xmath3518.5 @xcite and e(b - v)=0.10 @xcite .",
    "however , in order to obtain the best fit to the observed sequences with each isochrone set , we left distance modulus and reddening to vary by @xmath3610@xmath37% and @xmath3630@xmath37% , respectively .",
    "6 shows the best fit results for each isochrone set , while table 1 lists the corresponding best fit values of age , reddening , distance modulus and the predicted magnitude level for the rgb - bump .",
    "the best fit solution from each model set has been identified as the one matching the following features : ( _ i _ ) the he - clump magnitude level , ( _ ii _ ) the magnitude difference between the he - clump and the sgb and ( _ iii _ ) the color extension of the sgb .",
    "the theoretical isochrones have been reported into the observational plane by means of suitable transformations computed by using the code described in @xcite and convolving the model atmospheres by @xcite with the acs filter responses . in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss the comparison between the observed evolutionary features and theoretical predictions .    * * basti models * : by selecting canonical models from the basti dataset , the best fit solution gives an age of 1.9 gyr , with e(b - v)=0.09 and a distance modulus of 18.47 .",
    "despite of the good matching of the he - clump and sgb magnitude level , and the rgb slope , this isochrone does not properly reproduce the shape of the to region and the _ overall contraction phase _ ( _ panel ( a ) _ of fig.6 ) .",
    "the best - fit solution from overshooting models gives an age of 3.2 gyr , @xmath38= 18.43 and e(b - v)=0.09 , and matches the main loci of the evolutionary sequences in the cmd .",
    "in particular , this isochrone provides a better match to the hook - like region ( between the ms and the sgb , see _ panel ( b ) _ of fig.6 ) . + * * pel models * : _ panels ( c ) , ( d ) _ and _ ( e ) _ of fig .",

    "as can be seen values of @xmath3=0 and @xmath3=0.25 isochrones fail to fit the sgb extension and the hook - like feature , conversely a very good fit is obtained with a mild - overshooting ( @xmath3=0.1 ) and an age of @xmath4=1.9 gyr . + * * padua models * : the best - fit solution gives @xmath4=2.2 gyr , @xmath38=18.38 and e(b - v)=0.07 ( _ panels ( f ) _ of fig .",
    "this isochrone well - reproduces the complex structure of the to and the core contraction stage , as well as the sgb structure and the rgb slope .",
    "however , it requires distance modulus and reddening significantly lower than those generally adopted for the lmc .    from this comparison ,",
    "it turns out that only models with overshooting are able to best fit the morphology of the main evolutionary sequences in the observed cmd .",
    "in particular , the best fit solutions have been obtained with the basti overshooting model with @xmath4=3.2 gyr , the pel mild - overshooting model ( @xmath3=0.1 ) and @xmath4=1.9 gyr and the padua model with @xmath32=0.25 ( corresponding to @xmath3=0.25 ) and @xmath4=2.2 gyr .",
    "however , it must be noted that none of these models satisfactorly can fit the observed bump level , the basti and padua models being @xmath100.1 and 0.3 mag fainter , respectively , and the pel model @xmath100.2 mag brighter , perhaps suggesting that evolutionary tracks for stars with m@xmath201@xmath30 still need some fine tuning to properly reproduce the luminosity of this feature .",
    "since the comparison between the observed cmd and theoretical isochrones is somewhat qualitative , we also performed a quantitative comparison between theoretical and empirical population ratios : this yields a direct check of the evolutionary timescales .",
    "to do this , we define four boxes selecting the stellar population along the main evolutionary features in our cmd , namely the he - clump , the sgb , the rgb ( from the base up to @xmath1219.4 ) and finally the brightest ( @xmath6 1 mag ) portion of the ms ; these boxes are show in fig . 7 , overplotted to the cluster cmd .",
    "star counts in each box have been corrected for incompleteness , by dividing the observed counts by the @xmath39 factor obtained from the procedure described in sec .",
    "2.3 ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) for each bin of magnitude .",
    "star counts have been also corrected for field contamination . to estimate the degree of contamination by foreground and background stars",

    "we have used the cmd shown in fig .",
    "2 as representative of the field population .",
    "the number of stars counted in each box in the control field have been normalized to the cluster sampled area and finally subtracted from the cluster star counts .",

    "in addition , in the error budget we also include the uncertainty due to the positioning of the box edges : note that a slightly different(@xmath52 ) assumption in the definition of the box edge has little impact ( typically 7 - 8% ) on the star counts .",

    "the theoretical population ratios are poorly dependent on the assumed imf , with a 16% maximum variation ( between scalo and kroupa imfs ) for the @xmath43/@xmath56 ratios .",

    "the detection presented here is the first clearcut detection of the rgb bump in an intermediate age cluster and it confirms the theoretical expectation that this feature also occurs in relatively massive stars ( the estimated to mass for this cluster is @xmath61.5 @xmath30 , see tab .",

    "the high - ellipticity ( @xmath8=0.30@xmath10.02 ) of ngc 1978 poses two major questions : _",

    "ii ) _  why ngc 1978 is more elliptical than the other lmc clusters ?",
    "+ @xcite suggests that the relatively small lmc tidal field can preserve the pristine triaxial structure of the clusters , while the strong tidal field of our galaxy tend to destroy it , thus removing at least part of the ellipticity .",
    "+ in order to explain the especially high ellipticity of ngc 1978 three main hypothesis have been proposed in the past : a merging episode , a rotation effect and an anisotropic velocity dispersion tensor @xcite .",
    "the merging scenario has been proposed because the broad rgb from ground - based bvri photometry @xcite and because the preliminary evidence of a metallicity dispersion from high - resolution spectroscopy of two rgb stars @xcite ( @xmath58[fe / h]@xmath60.2 - 0.3 dex ) . however , the tiny rgb sequence presented in this work as well as the recent iron abundance estimate from high - resolution spectra of eleven rgb stars presented by @xcite definitely excluded any significant metallicity spread within the cluster .    our new age estimate ( @xmath4=1.9@xmath10.1 gyr ) of ngc 1978 , coupled with the new iron abundance determination ( [ fe / h]=-0.38@xmath10.02 dex ) by @xcite , provide new coordinates for this cluster in the age - metallicity plane .",
    "this is especially important , since the correct shape of the amr in the lmc is still matter of debate : in particular the origin of the observed bimodality in the lmc cluster age distribution has been interpreted as the evidence for two major episodes of star formation .",
