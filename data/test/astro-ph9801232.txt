    "black hole binary systems give one of the most direct ways in which to study the physics of accretion disks .",
    "there is no surface boundary layer or strong central magnetic field to disrupt the flow , and the orbital parameters are often well studied so that the inclination , mass and distance of the system are tightly constrained .",
    "additionally , many of these systems ( the soft x  ray transients , hereafter sxt ) show dramatic outbursts where the luminosity rises rapidly from a very faint quiescent state to one which is close to the eddington limit , and then declines again over a period of months , giving a clear sequence of spectra as a function of mass accretion rate .",
    "the usual pattern for such objects is for the outburst to be dominated by a soft component of temperature @xmath1 kev , with or without a ( rather steep ) power law tail , while the later stages of the decline show much harder power law spectra , extending out to 100200 kev ( see e.g. tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "the `` standard '' accretion disk model developed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ; hereafter ss ) derives the accretion flow structure in the limit when the gravitational energy released is radiated locally in a geometrically thin disk .",
    "such models give temperatures of order 1 kev for sxt in outburst , but are unable to explain the presence of a ( hard or soft ) power law tail to high energies .",
    "either there are parts of the disk flow in a different configuration to that of ss , or there is some non  disk structure such as a corona powered by magnetic reconnection ( e.g.  haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "recently , another solution of the accretion flow was postulated to explain the hard x  ray data . below a critical accretion rate ,",
    "@xmath2 , a stable , hot , optically thin , geometrically thick solution can be found if radial energy transport ( advection ) is included ( see e.g.  the review by narayan 1997 and the discussion by chen et al .",
    "1995 of how all the accretion flow solutions fit together ) . in the absence of an optically thick disk the hot electrons can only cool via cyclotron / synchrotron emission ( on an internally generated magnetic field ) , bremsstrahlung , or compton scattering of the resultant spectra of these two processes .",
    "the lack of strong flux of soft photons in these models means that the x  ray spectra are typically hard .",
    "such flows were proposed to explain the hard and very faint x ",
    "ray spectra seen from black holes candidates ( bhc ) in quiescence ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ) .",
    "these models were then extended by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ; hereafter emn ) to cover the whole range of luminosity seen in sxt .",
    "emn assume that accretion takes place via an ss disk for the incoming material beyond some ( large ) truncation radius of @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) , but that interior to this the flow _ always _ jumps to the advective solution if the latter exists . during the outburst the mass accretion rate goes above that at which an advective flow can be sustained ,",
    "so they assume that the disk adopts the ss solution , forming a cool flow down to @xmath5 and hence producing soft spectra . during the decline the mass accretion rate falls below @xmath6 , producing an intermediate stage as the ss disk retreats .",
    "the transition radius between the advective and ss flow progressively increases , and the low state proper is defined to be where the ss disk is again restricted to beyond @xmath7 , although the spectrum is indistinguishable from this for transition radii @xmath8 .",
    "this change from an ss to advective disk solution takes place over a very small range in total luminosity , and is postulated to explain the soft  hard transition seen in the sxt .",
    "emn tested their model on data of nova muscae 1991 , and found that it could indeed reproduce the overall spectral evolution of the source .",
    "this model predicts large changes in the accretion geometry as a function of mass accretion rate ( see figure 1 of emn ) which can be observationally tested by spectral studies of x  ray reprocessing .",
    "x  rays interact with optically thick material to produce a reflected continuum due to compton scattering and the iron @xmath9 line due to fluorescence / recombination .",
    "their normalizations determine the solid angle of the reprocessor as seen from the x  ray source while the shape of the reflected continuum below 10 kev , the line energy and its equivalent width are functions of ionization state of the reprocessor .",
    "if the reflecting material is indeed a disk extending close to the black hole then the reprocessed spectrum is strongly smeared by the combination of high orbital velocities and strong gravity ( fabian et al .  1989 ; laor 1991 ; ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) . in the emn model",
    "it is clear that as the source changes from high to low state then the amount of reflection should decrease , together with the amount of relativistic smearing , as the optically thick reflecting disk moves outwards .    in this letter we present results of spectral analysis of data of soft x  ray transient gs  1124 - 68 ( nova muscae 1991 ) with the emphasis on detailed modeling of the effects of x  ray reprocessing .",
    "our results confirm the prediction of emn that the covering fraction of the reprocessing matter decreases as the source luminosity declines .",
    "however , the normalization of the reflected component and the amount of relativistic smearing are both significantly larger than the model predictions , indicating that the ss disk retreats outwards more slowly than predicted during the intermediate and low states .",
    "the hard ( low state ) spectra seen in the persistent bhc and sxt during decline are incompatible with the emn scenario of an optically thin accretion flow extending out to @xmath10 , and instead require that there is a transition from an optically thin to optically thick structure at @xmath0 .",
    "observations of nova muscae 1991 and various aspects of data modeling were described in detail by ebisawa et al .",
    "we re  extracted the data from the archive in leicester and subtracted the background using a modified version ( ycki , done & smith 1997 ) of standard procedures ( hayashida et al .",
    "1989 ) . for our analysis",
    "we have selected six data sets : january 11th , may 18th , june 13th , june 21st , july 23rd , and september 3rd .",
    "these are the only datasets in which the hard tail is sufficiently developed to search for reflection , and where the instrument is accurately pointed ( within @xmath11 ) at the source .",
    "our basic model of the x  ray spectrum is a sum of a primary power law and the reprocessed component which is a sum of the compton  reflected continuum and the iron @xmath9 line near @xmath12kev .",
    "the reflected continuum is computed using the angle  dependent green functions of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) , with the possibility of partial ionization ( parameterised by ionization parameter , @xmath13 ) as in done et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , all as implemented in the `` pexriv '' model in xspec version 9.01 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "this is a very basic ionization code , balancing the photo  ionization from the power law irradiation with radiative recombination at a given fixed temperature , which we set to @xmath14 k. the self  consistent iron @xmath9 line for this ionization state , computed using the monte carlo code described in ycki & czerny ( 1994 ) , is then added to the continuum .",
    "the relativistic effects expected from an accretion disk around a ( non  rotating ) black hole are simulated by convolving this total ( line plus continuum ) spectrum with the xspec `` diskline '' model .",
    "this is parameterised by the inner and outer radius of the disk , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , its inclination and the irradiation emissivity , @xmath17 .",
    "the latter three are fixed at @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( orosz et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath20 , respectively , while we fit for @xmath15 , the ionization state @xmath21 , and the amplitude of the reprocessed component expressed as a solid angle subtended by the reprocessor from the x  ray source , @xmath22 , normalized to @xmath23 , i.e.  @xmath24 ( see also ycki et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "our code also allows the ionization to vary as a function of radius , @xmath25 , by splitting the disk into radial rings of constant ionization state .",
    "the relative covering fraction of each ring is determined by the emissivity and the relativistic corrections are given by the extent of each ring .",
    "during its decline phase nova muscae 1991 went through a sequence of distinct `` states '' ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; emn ) . during and soon after the outburst the source was in the very high state ( vhs ; january 11th data ) , with both a strong soft component and a power law tail . two and a half",
    "months later that changed into high state ( hs ) , where the soft component dominates , and further one and a half months later , in mid - may , the intermediate state ( is ) began in which the soft component dramatically decreases while the power law tail hardens and increases in intensity .",
    "this is then followed two months later by the low state ( ls ; july 23rd and september 3rd data sets ) , where the hard power law dominates the luminosity output .",
    "an important point for the january ( vhs ) and may ( hs / is ) data is the description of the soft thermal component since it dominates the spectrum below @xmath26kev . we model this by optically thick comptonization of soft seed photons ( titarchuk 1994 ; as implemented in the `` comptt '' model in xspec ) , since simple blackbody and disk blackbody models ( with or without relativistic corrections ) can not give an adequate description of the observed spectral shape ( see also gierliski et al .",
    "1997b ) . the results for the june and july data are not sensitive to a choice of the soft component so here we use the multi - temperature disk blackbody model ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "first , we have checked that the spectral features seen in the data at 58 kev , which we will attribute to x  ray reprocessing , can not be accounted for by the effects of comptonization , even if a broad distribution of soft seed photons is assumed . to this end",
    "we have modelled the may 18th data using `` comptt '' for the soft component and we convolved it with the relativistic green functions of titarchuk ( 1994 ) to obtain the model for the hard component .",
    "such a two component model fails to account for the data ( @xmath27 ) and the residuals clearly indicate the presence of the reprocessed component .",
    "the situation is not improved if the soft component is modeled using the green functions of sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) convolved with a blackbody .",
    "we first model the reprocessed component assuming its uniform ionization ( @xmath28 ; table  [ tab : inter ] ) .",
    "reflection is significantly detected in all but the september 3rd dataset , where the signal to noise is insufficient to obtain interesting constraints . even in the vhs , where the soft component is very strong ,",
    "reflection is significantly detected and its amount is quite well determined .",
    "it is strongly ionized and relativistically smeared ( see gierliski et al .",
    "1997b for a similar result for the soft state of cyg x1 ) .",
    "at the beginning of the is ( may 18th data set ) the reflector is still highly ionized , but as the importance of the soft component declines , the ionization state also drops ( to @xmath29 where iron is predominantly ionized only to fe vii ",
    "ix ) , and the power law hardens by @xmath30 without a significant change in its total flux .",
    "relativistic smearing of the reflection spectrum is significant in all the datasets except for july 23rd and september 3rd .",
    "fit spectra for the may 18th and june 13th data sets are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont ] shows the derived confidence contours for @xmath15 and @xmath31 during the is and ls .",
    "clearly the data require that the solid angle decreases as the source declines , and while there is no statistical _ requirement _ that the relativistic smearing decreases , the data are consistent with a monotonic increase in @xmath15 .    to see how these results depend on any ionization structure",
    ", we repeated the fits for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as expected from a gas and radiation pressure dominated ss disk , respectively ( with the assumed @xmath34 ) . only the contours for the may 18th dataset change , since this is the only one shown which has strong ionization .",
    "we include these results in figure  [ fig : cont ] by the dashed and dotted lines for the gas and radiation pressure dominated cases , respectively .",
    "both allow much larger reflected fractions , since there is now a contribution from very highly ionized material at the inner disk edge which gives negligible spectral features . while this material is also strongly affected by the relativistic smearing",
    ", the lack of features means that there are no observational signatures until further out in the disk where the ionization drops , so allowing smaller values of @xmath15 .",
    "we have also checked that a different model for the soft component in the may data does not change the results concering the reprocessed component . using the solution of sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) convolved with a blackbody spectrum to model the soft component we re - derived the confidence contours in the @xmath31 vs.  @xmath15 plane .",
    "the best fit and minimum values of @xmath31 and @xmath15 agree to within 10% with previous results ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] ) while the maximum values are larger by 20% when the sunyaev & titarchuk solution is used .",
    "we can use the results of our spectral fitting to derive the geometry , and then compare this with that proposed by emn in their scenario based on advective disk .",
    "our derived limits on the inner radius of the accretion disk from the amount of relativistic smearing are dependent on the illumination emissivity , for which we assumed @xmath34 .",
    "this should be a good approximation for a central quasi ",
    "spherical source even if there is some overlap between the cold disk and hot source ( poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "thus it seems likely that the radii derived in the previous section are reasonable unless the disk flares substantially , and/or there are significant non  local effects in the energy generation and/or relativistic corrections are important .    in the vhs ,",
    "hs and beginning of the is , where the spectrum contains a strong soft component , the emn model predicts that the disk extends down to the last stable orbit at @xmath35 . from the fits to the may ( hs / is ) data we see that indeed the reflector subtends a large solid angle with respect to the hard x  ray source and the spectrum is strongly relativistically smeared , although the data prefer an inner radius of @xmath36 , and are formally inconsistent with @xmath37 .",
    "relativistic corrections to the illumination emissivity will be important at these small radii , although the results of reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) suggest that this should lead to a steeper dependence , rather than the flatter one needed for the data to be consistent with @xmath38 .",
    "a more likely possibility to retrieve a disk down to the last stable orbit is that the strong ionization of the reflector seen in this state is not adequately modeled ( the ionization balance derived from done et al.1992 is rather approximate ) , and that this has distorted the fit .",
    "this strong ionization of the upper layers of the disk probably results from the intense gravitational energy release within the ss flow , and it may lead to comptonization of the emerging soft photons , producing the observed spectral shape of the thermal emission ( ross & fabian 1993 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "however , the next stage of evolution in the is does not seem to be properly described by the emn model .",
    "since the hard x  ray flux was roughly constant between may and june the observed dramatic decrease of the ionization , from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , must be related to the disappearance of the soft component .",
    "consequently , the power law becomes harder , since the availability of seed photons for compton cooling is dramatically reduced .",
    "however , the dramatic spectral change was _ not _ accompanied by any significant change of @xmath15 , although the best fit value of @xmath31 decreases by @xmath41 .",
    "this could be produced by a small increase in @xmath15 , from @xmath42 to @xmath36 , depending on the emissivity , which is within the error contours of figure  [ fig : cont ] .",
    "it is clearly incompatible with the prediction of emn that @xmath15 should be @xmath43 for the june data since this would produce no significant relativistic smearing of the iron spectral features and too small amplitude of reflection .",
    "similarly , the properties of the reprocessed component in the july data ( ls ) are incompatible with the emn computations .",
    "while the effect of smearing constrains @xmath15 to be @xmath44 , the amplitude of reflection , @xmath45 , requires @xmath15 to be @xmath46 for the emn geometry ( obtained using simple monte carlo code for photons propagation without further interactions after their generation ) . with @xmath47 ,",
    "as postulated by emn , the amplitude @xmath31 would be negligible .",
    "the values of @xmath31 inferred by us are also in agreement with those for cyg x-1 and gx 339 - 4 in low states , from both simple fits to the data and detailed modeling of the continuum emission ( ueda , ebisawa & done 1994 ; ebisawa et al .  1996 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1997a ; dove et al .",
    "1997 ; poutanen et al .",
    "the amplitude @xmath48 seems thus to be a typical value for bhc in the low state , and shows that concept of accretion occurring in a optically thin flow from very large radii ( @xmath10 ) can not be sustained .",
    "thus , the observed transition from high ( soft ) to low ( hard ) state does seem to involve a retreat of the optically thick material , as in the emn model .",
    "however , the inner disk radius is much smaller than the values postulated by emn in their intermediate and low states . since their treatment of the transition radius marking the edge of the advective flow and the standard ss disk",
    "is assumed rather than calculated then this may not be an insurmountable problem .",
    "the major spectral change in their model occurs as @xmath15 changes from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , which corresponds well to the observed constraints during the high / low state transition , suggesting that it is indeed associated with the innermost regions of the accretion flow becoming optically thin .",
    "however , the sudden switching of _ all _ the accretion flow into an optically thin state over a very small range in @xmath51 is a major facet of their model , and is clearly inconsistent with the observed behavior of bhc in general and nova muscae in particular .",
