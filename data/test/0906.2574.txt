    "while our current understanding of fracture begins with the ideas of griffith in 1921 @xcite , the study of its atomic mechanism has attracted a large amount of attention in recent years .",
    "for example , corrections to griffith s results for a crack in a brittle material have been proposed and verified with atomistic simulations @xcite .",
    "also , large scale simulations have been used to study dynamical fracture @xcite .",
    "this increase in interest in fracture is partly due to computer simulations which promise an understanding at the atomic level description of the phenomena .",
    "however simulations face a fundamental problem @xcite : many atomic deformations are thermally activated and therefore involve long timescales which are difficult to simulate .",
    "most simulations overcome this problem by studying fracture with a pre - existing crack . in that case ,",
    "crack growth is a driven phenomena and there is no energy barrier to be overcome .",
    "only a few simulations have been used to study the formation of cracks at non - zero finite temperature without pre - existing cracks : void formation has been observed in 3d simulations of strained binary lennard - jones systems @xcite , and simulations for the rate of crack nucleation have been performed in a 2d spring network @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the rate of crack nucleation in heterogeneous materials has been found to obey an arrhenius law with an energy barrier scaling according to griffith s results @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we address the nucleation of cracks in a brittle two - dimensional material , i.e.  a sheet with a thickness of one atomic layer , through langevin dynamics .",
    "the rate constant for the nucleation of cracks follows an arrhenius law , from which the energy barrier is extracted .",
    "two situations in a square lattice are studied :  atomic interactions restricted to first neighbours and interactions extended to second neighbours . in the former case ,",
    "the shear modulus of the solid is zero and the energy barrier is shown to be independent of system size :  the breakage of a single bond propagates to the rest of the solid without any cost . in the latter case",
    "the shear modulus is non - zero and a finite size crack has to nucleate before rupture can propagate throughout the system .",
    "these two situations will be referred to as chain - like and solid - like models , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the models used in this paper followed by a description of how simulations are carried out . in section [ section : results ] we present the results for the chain - like and solid - like models .",
    "the latter is physically more relevant to describe brittle materials and we discuss its energy barrier in the context of griffith theory in section [ section : griffith ] .",
    "our conclusions finalize the paper .",
    "a stretched one dimensional chain has been previously used as a simple model for breakage of polymers  @xcite . here",
    "we extend this model to study fracture in 2d brittle solids by bonding the chains to each other such as to form a square lattice ",

    "we study samples containing @xmath0 chains which are made of @xmath1 atoms each .",
    "those chains are stretched in the horizontal direction :  their constant length is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the equilibrium bond length and @xmath4 is the applied strain . by constraining the dynamics of atoms along the applied strain",
    "the system can not form topological defects and the only mechanism for stress relaxation is fracture .",
    "also , by choosing the constraint along the applied strain , we expect to be sampling the meaningful pathway for fracture while speeding up the simulation time .",

    "to fulfil this condition we chose the following form for the lennard - jones potential between first neighbors : @xmath5 , \\label{eqn : lennardjones}\\ ] ] and @xmath6,\\ ] ] for second neighbors .",
    "we use @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the binding energies and @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the equilibrium lengths .",
    "the dynamics of this system are obtained by solving a set of langevin equations for the position @xmath11 of each atom : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the force computed from the potential , @xmath14 is the atomic mass and @xmath15 is the friction coefficient . the random force @xmath16 is related to @xmath15 by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction imply @xmath17 and @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "periodicity is also imposed in the vertical direction to ensure that all chains are equivalent : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for simplicity",

    "initially all the horizontal bonds have the same length @xmath25 and all vertical bonds are at their equilibrium length @xmath3 .",

    "this energy fluctuates around its initial value showing that the initial stretched state is a configuration at a local energy minimum .",
    "rupture occurs at about @xmath28 units of time when the energy of the system drops abruptly .",
    "this shows that the system is been driven towards an equilibrium state with lower energy . in panels a , b , c and d of this figure , we shown atomic configurations at different instances along fracture . in those panels ,",
    "the incipient crack is seen to propagate perpendicularly to the direction of applied strain .",
    "this indicates that we can use the sum of bond lengths along the pathway where fracture is taking place as an order parameter @xmath29 for fracture . for convenience ,",
    "the sum is taken over all the largest bonds percolating vertically along the sample and only the horizontal bonds are considered in the sum .",
    "thus , initially @xmath30 and @xmath29 increases until two surfaces are formed .",
    "notice that the potential energy in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] shows no apparent precursor behavior for rupture . also , the energy barrier that the system has to overcome for rupture to proceed is smaller than fluctuations in the total potential energy .",
    "thus it can not be easily extracted from an analysis of the potential energy . to obtain this barrier we study the kinetics of the system as it proceeds towards rupture .",
    "in particular we measure the characteristic time of rupture and analyze this quantity from the point of view of thermally activated systems .",
    "to compute the characteristic time of rupture @xmath31 we use an ensemble containing @xmath32 samples for the chain - like model and @xmath33 samples for the solid - like model .",

    "we will need to choose a value of the order parameter @xmath29 which we will associate with irreversible rupture .",
    "the characteristic time for the incipient crack to reach a particular size is computed by tracking the number of chains @xmath34 whose order parameter has not yet reached the value @xmath29 at time @xmath35 . for a fixed value of @xmath29 this function decreases exponentially with time , @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the dashed line separates reversible ( left side ) from irreversible ( right side ) rupture.,height=264 ]    the time that characterizes rupture in an irreversible manner depends on the arbitrary choice of the cutoff value @xmath39 which we associate with rupture . to chose this cut - off we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : quebra ] the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath29 .",
    "two distinct regimes are apparent .",
    "the first regime occurs when @xmath29 is smaller than  @xmath40 ( in units of @xmath3 ) . in this regime",
    ", @xmath29 increases very slowly with time .",
    "the underlying physics of this regime is the competition between thermal fluctuations , which are responsible for increasing crack length , and the restoring force on the atomic bonds .",
    "the second regime occurs when the order parameter @xmath29 is greater than 65.8 . here",
    ", @xmath37 has reached a plateau , and @xmath29 increases very rapidly with time .",
    "stress relief of the material s bulk is the driving force of this regime which requires a larger crack and therefore produces a fast increase in @xmath29 :  irreversible rupture has occurred .",
    "so , from fig .",
    "[ fig : quebra ] we can determine the value of @xmath29 for which rupture becomes irreversible .",
    "this value is @xmath41 .",
    "the nucleation of cracks can be thermally activated @xcite such that their occurrence is typical of an arrhenius process .",
    "mathematically the characteristic time of rupture @xmath31 , the inverse of the nucleation rate , reads : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is thermal energy , @xmath44 is the energy barrier the system has to overcome , and @xmath45 is the inverse of the attempt frequency to rupture .",
    "the attempt frequency depends on the vibration frequency of the system in the metastable wells of the energy landscape through the local curvature of the energy surface@xcite .",
    "it also depends on the friction coefficient in the langevin equation @xcite . in this section",

    "[ eqn : arrhenius ] .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath44 and the pre - factor @xmath45 were extracted from fits to those results .",
    "changing system size strongly affects the pre - factor but has no effect , within error bars , on the energy barrier  as can be seen in figures [ fig : scaling](b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "the dependence of the pre - factor on system - size can be understood qualitatively within the scope of a nucleation theory for fracture .",
    "intuitively , @xmath45 is proportional to the average time between two consecutive attempts to nucleate a crack . assuming that cracks can nucleate in each of the @xmath0 chains of the system , then @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : scaling](b ) shows the good agreement of simulation with this inverse relation .",
    "the energy barrier can be understood quantitatively by assuming that parallel chains are independent from each other . under this assumption , the energetic cost @xmath49 of elongating one atomic bond in a single layer",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath29 is the deviation of the broken bond length from its strained elongation and @xmath51 is the potential energy of an atomic bond .",
    "equation [ eqn : barrier_oliveira ] corresponds to the sum of potential energy of all the bonds in the layer precursor of fracture .",
    "this equation considers that while one of the bonds increases towards rupture by an amount @xmath29 , the other bonds of the same layer relax by an amount @xmath52 towards their equilibrium value . for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , i.e.  @xmath1 and @xmath53 , equation [ eqn : barrier_oliveira ] predicts an energy barrier of @xmath54 .",
    "this is in good agreement with our simulations where the barrier is approximately @xmath55 for all system sizes .",
    "independence of parallel chains is the key assumption to explain fracture in the chain - like model .",
    "this assumption can be understood as follow .",
    "since the shear modulus of this model is zero , no energetic cost is associated with sheared configurations in the linear regime .",
    "therefore , an individual atomic layer can proceed towards fracture independently of neighbouring layers until non - linear effects become relevant .",
    "the energy barrier opposing this process is related to the cost of increasing the length of one of the bonds of the layer  independently of other layers .",
    "only when this bond becomes large enough , neighbouring layers are driven towards rupture in a domino - like process .",
    "[ eqn : barrier_oliveira ] results from the competition between the energetic cost of extending one bond length of the chain and the energetic gain of relaxing the remaining bonds .",
    "this contrasts with griffith s calculation where the barrier is related to the cost of creating more surface and the energetic gain due to reducing the strain in the bulk of the material .",
    "thus , despite its use in the literature , the square lattice with only first neighbour interactions is a poor model for fracture in a solid and griffith s theory does not apply to this system .       on the inverse of temperature for",

    "those behaviors are related to finite size effects .",
    "when @xmath57 , the relaxation region around the crack is of the same size as the system . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing the size of the solid above 15 layers implies that more nucleation sites are available for rupture , and @xmath45 decreases with @xmath0 , as in the previous model @xcite .",
    "a quantitative assessment of the pre - factor would involve the generalisation of kramer s result to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this calculation was performed successfully to study rupture in a one - dimensional chain @xcite but its application to the present model is beyond the scope of this paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling2](c ) we show the energetic cost for nucleating a crack in the solid - like model as a function of system size @xmath0 . for solids smaller than @xmath59 ,",

    "[ fig : scaling2](c ) ; while for solids larger than @xmath59 , the increase is only marginal and show a saturation trend at @xmath61  indicating that finite - size effects become negligible .",
    "this value is comparable to the adiabatic barrier .",

    "a smaller simulated barrier compared to the adiabatic case has also been observed for one dimensional systems @xcite . a possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that a zero temperature calculation does not account for entropy which plays a role in the free energy opposing rupture in system with multiple degrees of freedom .    one important simplification imposed in our model with respect to two - dimensional solids consists in constraining the dynamics of atoms to one dimension . however by imposing this constraint along the direction of applied stress",

    "the young modulus of the solid - like model is @xmath75 ( in units of @xmath76 ) and the energy necessary to create two surfaces @xmath77 is equal to the energy of two weak and one strong bond per interatomic distance :  @xmath78 . for a strain @xmath79 ,",

    "second , for strains larger than 0.04 only one atomic layer needs to be completely broken in order to initiate the rupture process .",
    "in other words , while in griffith s regime the mechanism behind rupture is the competition between the formation of new surface and stress relaxation , the physics of rupture in the highly stressed regime is the competition between stress relaxation and bond stretching at the formation of the incipient crack .",
    "to understand the range of validity of griffith calculation , we performed adiabatic relaxation ( @xmath81 ) where bonds were mathematically cut within a line perpendicular to the applied strain .",
    "after cutting those bonds , atoms were relaxed until the force on each one of them was smaller than @xmath82 . to avoid finite - size effects we increased the size of the system from n=100 at s=0.04 to n=600 at s=0.01 . the relative energy barrier computed from this process with respect to griffith barrier",

    "this is very close to the exponent predicted by griffith s theory : -2 .",
    "the behavior at higher strains deviate from this scaling .",
    "this clearly shows that for our model griffith s theory is valid for strains smaller than 0.04 .",
    "we note that the calculation of the energy barrier with strain dependent young modulus and surface tension  as described in ref .",
    "@xcite  gave results in greater disagreement than the ones of griffith .",
    "due to its simple dynamics and large system size , our atomistic simulation of the nucleation of cracks in thin brittle sheets is an ideal system for the study of noise activated processes and nucleation theory .",
    "in particular , we found that the energy barrier for crack nucleation in a square lattice with only first - neighbor interactions is comparable to the barrier of one - dimensional chains due to the zero shear modulus of this system .",
    "for the more interesting case where second - neighbor interactions are incorporated into the model , we found an agreement between the simulated energy barrier at high strains and the one computed from an adiabatic relaxation .",
    "this barrier involves several layers , accounting for a much higher barrier compared to the case of isolated chains .",
    "we believe that extensions of the present study such as to investigate nucleation of pre - existing cracks would be a valuable contribution to understand fracture ."
