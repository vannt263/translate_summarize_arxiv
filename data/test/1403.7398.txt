    "in order to clarify the mechanism responsible for high - temperature superconductivity in the superconducting ( sc ) cuprates profound knowledge on the exact nature of the underlying `` normal '' , i.e. , non - superconducting state is mandatory .",
    "this long - standing issue , however , remains controversial . even for the relatively simple case of the electron - doped cuprates @xmath5ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( @xmath6nd , pr , sm , la ) , where the sc state emerges in direct neighbourhood of a state with commensurate antiferromagnetic ( af ) order , it is not clear whether the two states coexist and , if yes , to which extent . @xcite for example , a number of neutron scattering studies have been reported , providing arguments both for @xcite and against @xcite the coexistence .",

    "based on the normal - state hall and seebeck effects in @xmath10 thin films a quantum critical point ( qcp ) associated with the fermi surface reconstruction was proposed to lie under the sc dome in the overdoped range of the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite finally , studies of the power - law temperature dependence of the resistivity in @xmath11 films @xcite have suggested a qcp at exactly the sc critical doping level @xmath12 on the overdoped side of the phase diagram .    for cuprate superconductors sample quality or surface effects are often invoked to explain apparently contradictory results . indeed ,",

    "optical and arpes techniques are sensitive to surface properties . in this respect ,",
    "techniques based on magnetic quantum oscillations have obvious advantages : they probe bulk properties and can be performed on small single crystals , whose high quality is already ensured by the very existence of quantum oscillations .    the first experiment on magnetoresistance quantum oscillations ( shubnikov - de haas , sdh effect ) in nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( ncco ) crystals @xcite apparently corroborated the existence of a qcp hidden under the sc dome on the overdoped side , i.e. between @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , subsequent more elaborate sdh experiments @xcite have further extended the range in which the fermi surface stays reconstructed up to at least @xmath14 , the highest ( though still sc ) doping level attainable in bulk ncco crystals .",
    "thus , while the existence of one or even more critical points associated with a fermi surface reconstruction in the electron - doped cuprates is generally accepted , @xcite the question about their location with respect to the sc part of the phase diagram and their possible relation to the sc pairing remains open .    here",

    "this change can not simply be explained by the experimentally observed @xcite weak @xmath16-dependence of the area of the @xmath37 orbit .",

    "the @xmath16-dependence of @xmath98 in the overdoped regime is governed by that of the mb gap : it rapidly grows upon going from @xmath14 to @xmath103 . at optimal doping",

    "assuming for a moment that the oscillations are , however , inherent to a perfectly homogeneous @xmath105 sample , we estimate that the cyclotron mass should increase by almost a factor of 2 at decreasing @xmath16 by @xmath106 , in order to account for the observed reduction of the amplitude .",
    "such a steep rise would be a strong argument in favor of the mass divergence near the optimal doping level .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the observed suppression might involve an abrupt change in the electronic spectrum or in scattering processes .",
    "we note that a trivial scenario associated with a poor crystal quality is highly unlikely in our case . from the crystal growth point of view , @xcite the sample quality should not vary considerably with @xmath16 around @xmath13 .",
    "consistently , the dingle temperatures , sensitive to crystal imperfections , @xcite obtained from our fits in fig.[sdh ] are close to each other , @xmath107k , for crystals with @xmath89 to 0.16 ( see table[table ] ) .",
    "this suggests that also for slightly underdoped samples , @xmath108 , quality is unlikely a critical issue .",
    "hence , the reason for the suppression of the quantum oscillations must lie in an intrinsic significant change in the electronic system .",
    "to gain further insight in this change , we have studied the high - field hall effect in ncco crystals with different ce concentrations , focusing on the regime around @xmath13 .",

    "important new features have been detected in the close vicinity of @xmath13 .",
