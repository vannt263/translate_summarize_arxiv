    "as scientists and as educators we ask ourselves , `` how do we know what we know ? ''",
    "if we had to derive everything we used from scratch , we would not have the time to make much progress .",
    "but it is worthwhile to derive _ some _ fundamental parameters that we use in our area of expertise . in 1987",
    "mit physicist philip morrison hosted a television series called `` ring of truth : an inquiry into how we know what we know . ''",
    "one purpose of the show was to demonstrate simple measurements . in the episode called `` mapping ''",
    "he measured the circumference of the earth with the `` van of eratosthenes '' .",
    "he and his crew went to the north edge of kansas and measured the elevation angle of the bright southern star antares as it transited the meridian .",
    "then they drove 370 miles down highway 183 to the south edge of kansas and measured antares again .",
    "they found that it was 5 degrees higher at the second location .",
    "the distance corresponded to 1/72 of a circle , so the implied circumference of the earth was 26,600 miles , which is a bit more than 6 percent greater than the correct value ( 24,901 miles ) .    the cosmological distance ladder is a sequence of steps used by astronomers to derive distances within the solar system , throughout the galaxy , and beyond to the farthest galaxies detectable @xcite .",
    "it hinges on simple geometry and the principles of surveying .",
    "for example , using the positions of two observers separated by some baseline on the earth , we can determine the distance to the moon , a nearby planet or an asteroid .    in this paper",
    "we determine the sizes of the first three rungs of the cosmological distance ladder .",
    "these are : 1 ) the radius of the earth ; 2 ) the distance to the moon ; and 3 ) the distance to the sun ( i.e. the size of the astronomical unit , or au ) .",
    "the first two can be accomplished without a telescope .",
    "the third was attempted by various pre - telescopic astronomers such as tycho brahe in 1582 @xcite , but was not accomplished until 1672 by gian domenico cassini and john flamsteed @xcite , who made observations of mars when it was prominently visible in the middle of the night and therefore about as close to the earth as it gets .",
    "( mars is roughly 0.6 au distant at such a time .",
    "when it is on the other side of the sun it is 2.6 au distant . )",
    "measuring the size of the au requires telescopic measurements or distances to nearby planets or asteroids determined with radar .",
    "once the scale of the solar system is known , we can determine the distances to nearby stars via trigonometric stellar parallaxes if our positional measurements are good to better than 0.1 arc second .",
    "then , classically , we determine the distance to the hyades star cluster @xcite and tie other star clusters to the hyades distance . with the discovery of certain standard candles and standardizable candles in star clusters ( e.g. rr lyrae stars and cepheids ) , we can calibrate the mean intrinsic brightness of these pulsating stars .",
    "they are useful for distance determinations throughout our galaxy . with the hubble space telescope we can determine distances to other galaxies using the cepheid period - luminosity relation as far as 25 million parsecs @xcite .",
    "( 1 parsec equals 3.086 @xmath2 10@xmath4 km , or 206265 au . )",
    "if we observe type ia supernovae in some galaxies whose distances are known via cepheids , we can calibrate the intrinsic brightness of these supernovae .",
    "since type ia supernovae are typically 4 billion times brighter than the sun at maximum brightness , they can be used to determine distances halfway across the observable universe with a 4-m class telescope .",
    "the methodology of this paper is to use only our own data , if possible .",
    "we make minimal use of the _ astronomical almanac _ and minimal use of telescopes .",

    "this is the systematic error .",
    "usually in science we do not know the `` true '' value , but in this case we do . from a scatter of the measurements of the shadow length of our gnomon",

    "our value of the tilt of the earth s axis of rotation to the plane of its orbit is 6 standard deviations from the true value .",

    "the bottom line is that we fit some data under the _ assumption _ that we have the appropriate function .",
    "what the most appropriate function is also depends on the typical size of the error bars of the data points . if the error bars are large , high order polynomial fits would be unjustified .",
    "using a vertical stick , a car , watch , map , and map tool , we have measured the size of the earth from first principles .",

    "aristarchus s method of determining the distance to the moon derives from the geometry of the earth , moon , and sun at the time of a lunar eclipse .",
    "one key observable is the angular size of the earth s shadow at the distance of the moon compared to the angular size of the moon .",
    "using images available on the web of the lunar eclipse of 2011 june 15 we found that the earth s shadow was 2.56 times the angular diameter of the moon .",
    "the corresponding distance of the moon was 62.3 earth radii , about 3.3 percent larger than the true mean value .",
    "it is also possible to determine the distance to the moon from observations of its motion against the background of stars .",
    "these observations are made from a single site over the course of one night .",
    "this method is far more complicated than aristarchus s method , but from such observations we showed that the moon was between 47 and 62 r@xmath0 distant . the true range of the moon s distance is 55.9 to 63.8 r@xmath0 .    simultaneous observations from socorro , new mexico , and ojai , california allowed us to determine the distance to the asteroid 1996 hw1 on 2008 july 24 .",
    "a determination of the orbital elements of this asteroid by one of us allowed us to calculate that the asteroid was 0.294 au distant on that date .",
    "the final result was a calibration of the au equal to ( 1.59 @xmath1 0.19 ) @xmath2 10@xmath3 km , which is 6 percent larger than the true value .",
    "given the seeing and tracking constraints associated with our asteroid observations , our asteroid experiment was at the limits of the technology of our small telescopes . to determine the distance to a _",

    "asteroid ( which would have been 10 times more distant ) would have required a baseline 10 times bigger than the 1130 km baseline we used if we wanted the parallax to be several arc seconds .",
    "such an experiment would be nearly impossible on the surface of the earth .",
    "this paper has overflowed with numerical and trigonometrical details . still , the _ qualitative _ results are easy to understand and are worth restating .",
    "using very inexpensive equipment we can determine the size of the earth and the distance to the moon . to determine the length of the au we do _ not _ need to organize an international endeavor like what was done for the venus transits of 1761 , 1769 , 1874 , and 1882 @xcite .",
    "we can measure the length of the au with carefully timed observations of a near earth asteroid using telescopes comparable to those owned by many amateur astronomers .",
    "it is also worth reminding ourselves why astronomers have such an obsession with determining cosmic distances .",
    "thanks to kepler s third law the length of the au gets us the distances to all other objects that orbit the sun .",
    "once we have the distances to stars like the sun ( converting hydrogen to helium in their cores , but with a range of mass ) via trigonometric stellar parallaxes ",
    "the next rung of the distance ladder  we can use photometric methods to determine distances to star clusters using the fact that `` main sequence stars '' of the same mass have comparable intrinsic brightness .",
    "a simple equation relates the apparent brightness of a star with its intrinsic brightness and the distance .",
    "we can exploit the cepheid period - luminosity law to calibrate our way across the galaxy and to nearby galaxies . knowing the energy budget of a star helps us determine what it is made of , what is its structure , how it will live , and how it will die .",
    "luminosities of type ia supernovae have allowed us to address some the largest questions we can ask , such as , `` what is the ultimate fate of the universe ? ''",
    "the interconnectedness of astronomical topics means that the big questions are related to the earth size experiment of eratosthenes carried out more than 22 centuries ago . starting with an instrument as simple as a vertical stick we can connect basic and profound aspects of the universe we inhabit .",
