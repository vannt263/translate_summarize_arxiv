    "i would like to revive , from a new viewpoint , a somewhat old fashioned discussion , which recently seems to be all but extinct . as goes without saying , every contribution , correction , criticism or suggestion is greatly appreciated .",
    "the discussion , which lasted for the major part of the early stages of atomic , nuclear and particle physics , as we know them today , dealt primarily with the scientific and logical implications of quantum theory . again revived by david bohm s contribution , the `` hidden variables '' , it gradually began to loose on impact , until today any fundamental question in this respect seems to be considered a lack of scientific soundness .    from an epistemological point of view ,",
    "the fact is not easily understood , since all the fundamental problems are still far from any solution .",
    "second quantization , on the contrary , provides an even more problematic conception by its inherent infinity problems @xcite , which , till now , have not been solved in a satisfying way .    that all the original problems are still there , can be seen by a survey of late publications of bohm @xcite , de broglie @xcite , dirac @xcite , or schrdinger @xcite .    from the viewpoint of common sense",
    "the most profound reason of uneasiness with quantum theory , despite its indisputable successes , has been expressed by richard feynman : _ you see , my physics students do nt understand it either .",
    "that is , because i do nt understand it .",
    "nobody does .",
    "_ @xcite    that the discussion , mentioned above , is nevertheless non  existent , might have its origins therefore not so much in a satisfying status quo , but rather in a lack of alternative concepts . from an epistemological point of view a well working theory , despite all its conflicts with logical reasoning , is better than no theory .",
    "the discussion then leads to the question , why so far no promising concept has been put forth .",
    "comparing with other sciences , the situation seems very unusual :",
    "seventy years of continuous research  from schrdinger s first publications @xcite  have neither altered the principles of quantum theory , nor have they removed the axiomatic qualities of its fundamental statements .",
    "this situation basically leaves two possibilities : either to accept , that we can not understand , i.e. that we _ have to believe _ , or to search for alternatives .",
    "the attempts so far , to remove the axiomatic qualities of quantum theory , which can be summarized by the _ copenhagen interpretation _",
    "@xcite , mainly focussed on the statistical qualities attributed to fundamental physical events .",
    "it was thought , that a suitable theoretical framework could prove quantum events to be integral results of basically continuous processes .",
    "the first of these attempts can be attributed to erwin schrdinger @xcite .",
    "his wave mechanics , now a fundamental part of quantum theory , does not allow for an interpretation of wave  functions as _ physical _ waves due to the contradiction a spreading wave  packet presents to mass conservation . on a fundamental level",
    ", the contradiction originates in the difference between phase velocity and group velocity of de broglie waves @xcite .",
    "since schrdinger s equation is based on exactly these qualities of de broglie waves , it can not be retained without rejecting the interpretation of wave  functions as physical waves .",
    "the problem was solved by born s interpretation @xcite of @xmath4 as a _ probability amplitude _ , an interpretation which constitutes an integral part of the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "this interpretation of the wave  function is not without its inherent problems , as einstein , podolksky and rosen pointed out @xcite . if quantum theory contained all the physical information about a spin  system , thus their line of reasoning , then information about a measurement process must be exchanged with a velocity faster than c , if spin conservation is to be retained .",
    "this leaves , as they point out , only two alternatives : either quantum theory contradicts the theory of relativity , or it does not contain all the information about the system : in this case , quantum theory is incomplete .",
    "the scientific controversy was subject to much discussion , but never conclusively solved .",
    "recently , its implications have been extended by the phenomenon of  interaction  free  measurements @xcite , based on a thought experiment by renninger @xcite and realized by a mach ",
    "zehnder interferometer .",
    "interaction free measurements have different implications in a classical or quantum context : while a measurement without interaction in classical physics does not alter the system , it leads to a reduction of the wave function in quantum theory .",
    "according to the solution , proposed by heisenberg ( see ref.@xcite ) only the reduction of the wave  function constitutes physical reality : in this case the question is legitimate , why a wave function , obviously devoid of any physical meaning , plays such an important role in current theories .",
    "david bohm s famous theory of  hidden variables ",
    "@xcite was a far more elaborate concept along the same lines .",
    "he tried to prove , that the formalism of quantum theory allows for a sub  layer of hidden variables , and that the framework therefore is , as einstein suspected , incomplete .",
    "the modification was rejected due to the work of bell , who devised a simple situation , where this assumption could be put to a test @xcite .",
    "the  bell inequalities  proved that , within the framework of quantum theory , such an assumption leads to logical contradictions .",
    "the theory of hidden variables was therefore rejected .",
    "the combined evidence of all these attempts allows the conclusion , that a modification of quantum theory within its fundamental axioms , yielding a framework of which the quantum aspect will be but a result , is not very promising . at best , it reproduces numerical results by a different mathematical structure , at worst , it not even accounts for basic experiments .",
    "there remain , therefore , three fundamental questions to be answered prior to any attempted modification of micro physics :    * on what theoretical or experimental basis could an alternative formulation be based ? * which theoretical concept of physics , statistical , field ",
    "theory , or mechanics , shall be employed ? * what constitutes a successful alternative to current formulations ?    experimental evidence exists , that moving electrons exhibit wave  like features .",
    "these qualities have been established beyond doubt by diffraction experiments of davisson and germer @xcite .",
    "quantum theory can not directly access wave like qualities , because , as already mentioned , the periodic wave function needs to be subjected to a complicated evaluation process in order to extract its physical relevance .",
    "if the initial problems of wave dispersion and velocity can be overcome , the experimental result of wave characteristics of moving mass and its mathematical formalization may well constitute the foundation of a different theoretical conception . the only other experimental evidence at hand with equivalent significance , the quantum phenomena ,",
    "do not as easily fit into a physical interpretation , since the basic obstacle , why discrete values should be the only ones measured , has to be removed : quantum phenomena are therefore more remote in terms of basic concepts .",
    "concerning the theoretical context , it has to be considered , that quantum theory originally started as a modification of mechanics .",
    "most of the concepts of the theory are consequently still disguised mechanical concepts .",
    "field theoretical results are therefore only achieved by a statistical superstructure : the mechanical basis then leads to a statistical formulation of field theories , which allows for particle interactions , but not for internal particle structures",
    ". modifications of this methodology basically occur along two lines : either by a modification of interactions , which requires additional qualities of particles , or by postulating the existence of sub  particles .",
    "physical progress then requires an ever refined toolkit of particles , sub  particles and interactions . from the viewpoint of epistemology , the problem inherent to this approach is the limited degree of freedom .",
    "every modification requires a major change of particle properties , and since every new experiment provides data not yet accounted for , the development of physics becomes an ever increasing inventory of individual particles .",
    "the  particle  zoo  , high energy physicists so frequently refer to , can , along these epistemological lines , be seen as a consequence of theoretical shortcomings .    since the experimental basis ",
    "the wave characteristics and thus the internal structure of particles  suggest an approach based on field theory rather than mechanics , this essay will be based on field theory .",
    "if mechanical concepts are required , they always refer to continuous distributions of physical qualities , which yield discrete mass or charge values only by integration .",
    "if one is to try an alternative route of theoretical development , it seems important , not to get carried away and extend a concept beyond its limits of proper application . to this end",
    ", a goal has to be defined as well as careful checks of experimental evidence .",
    "a theory , which does not allow for falsification , remains useless , the same applies to a new theory , which does not deviate from the current one by at least one significant result . that a new theory can not  and should not  reproduce all results of an existing one , goes without saying",
    "personally , i think that the following results are sufficient to justify serious consideration of a new approach :    * the reproduction of fundamental results of early quantum theory * the formalization of internal particle structures and the proof of physical significance of these structures * a model of ( hydrogen ) atoms consistent with the formalism developed and consistent with experimental evidence * the basics of a theory of particle  interaction due to intrinsic characteristics * provision of at least one significant deviation which allows for an experimentum crucis    the fundamental relations and concepts of this new approach have already been published or are in print in the _ speculations in science and technology _ ( chapman and hall , london ) @xcite .",
    "the accounts given in this and follow  up papers are somewhat enhanced and thorougher versions , making use of the greater freedom of length .",
    "as already emphasized , any feedback is greatly appreciated and readers are welcomed to contact me directly via email at the email address : whofer@eapa04.iap.tuwien.ac.at",
    "to allow for internal characteristics of moving particles we base the following section on the experimental evidence of wave  features . theoretically , the framework will be based on a suitable adaptation of the fundamental relations found by l. de broglie .",
    "originally , de broglie s formalization of waves @xcite was based on the framework of special relativity , the amplitude of a  de broglie wave  given by :    @xmath5    the variables are four  dimensional vectors , their components are described by the following relations :    @xmath6    in a three dimensional and non  relativistic ( @xmath7 = 1 ) adaptation of the original equation ( [ ws001 ] ) the amplitude can be expressed as a plane wave .",
    "this adaptation is quite common in quantum theory and therefore no deviation from the original framework :    @xmath8    the first major deviation from the traditional framework is the interpretation of @xmath9 as a real function , as a physical wave .",
    "this conception is not compatible with quantum theory for the following reasons : as a moving particle can not consist of a specific plane wave ( particle mass in this case would be distributed over an infinite region of space ) , a moving particle in quantum theory _ must _ be formalized as a fourier integral over partial waves .",
    "an application of schrdinger s equation then leads to the , above mentioned , spreading of the wave  packet , which contradicts experimental evidence .",
    "the interpretation of the wave  function as a _ physical entity _ , furthermore , contradicts heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite , because it implies the possibility of measurements below quantum level .",
    "@xmath10    the reason , that this  real  formalization of de broglie remained so far unconsidered , is not only its inconsistency with quantum theory , but also a consequence of planck s relation : dispersion of de broglie waves is described by two independent relations , which are widely confirmed in experiments .",
    "the first is the wavelength of de broglie waves , established by diffraction experiments of davisson and germer @xcite , the second planck s energy relation @xcite :    @xmath11    if particle energy is classical _ kinetic _ or relativistic energy , the phase velocity of a de broglie wave is not equivalent to particle velocity :    @xmath12    the deduction of phase velocity , leading to the contradiction in eq .",
    "( [ ws006 ] ) is , contrary to a first impression , not self  evident .",
    "it contains , on thorougher analysis , a conjecture and a subsequent logical circle .",
    "firstly , it is not self  evident , that on a micro  level energy of a particle is restricted to _",
    "kinetic _ energy of inertial mass : assuming , that a particle is , basically , a mechanical entity without any internal energy component , can not be inferred from experimental or theoretical results .",
    "it is therefore an _ assumption _ lacking a solid basis .",
    "based on this conjecture is the following logical circle :    _ if energy is kinetic energy , phase velocity of a de broglie wave is not equal to mechanical velocity of a particle .",
    "if phase velocity does not equal mechanical velocity , a free particle can not consist of a single wave of specific frequency .",
    "if it does not consist of a single wave , then the wave  features of a particle must be formalized as a fourier integral over infinitely many partial waves . in this case",
    "any partial wave can not be interpreted as a physical wave .",
    "if the interpretation as a physical wave is not justified , then internal wave  features can not be related to physical qualities .",
    "if they can not be related to physical qualities , then internal processes must remain unconsidered . and if internal processes remain unconsidered , then energy of the particle is kinetic energy _",
    "apart from the question , whether this assumption is necessary , which can only be answered a posteriori , it seems also legitimate to ask , whether it is the best possible assumption , especially in view of complications arising from fundamental particles formalized as fourier integrals over infinitely many partial waves . from the viewpoint of simplicity , the concept is necessary , if no alternative exists , it is unnecessary complicated , if the same theoretical result  the wave features of single particles  can be obtained by a simpler formalism . to this aim alternatives",
    "have to be analyzed . a direct way of formalization would be based on two basic statements : ( 1 ) the experimental evidence of wave features , and ( 2 ) the assumption , that wave features must be reflected by _",
    "physical _ qualities of particles , density for example .",
    "mathematically , these statements are expressed by :    @xmath13    @xmath14    in view of the dispersion relations eq .",
    "[ ws005 ] these relations seem contradictory : the standard evaluation procedure would , for a specific _ physical _ wave , lead to a difference between phase velocity and mechanical velocity in conflict with the energy principle .",
    "this contradiction depends , though , on the principal conjecture , that a moving particle is equivalent to inertial mass , and that all its energy is contained in the  longitudinal  motion of an inertial mass @xmath15 with velocity @xmath16 .",
    "as soon as wave features are assumed to describe the physical nature of particle motion , this conjecture can no longer be sustained : energy of the particle will then be contained in its _ mass oscillations_.",
    "since mass oscillations determine a periodic change of kinetic energy , the energy principle requires the existence of an _ intrinsic _ potential of particle motion , and averaging over kinetic and potential energy during particle motion then leads to a total energy of double the original kinetic value . using this total energy for planck",
    "s relation satisfies the dispersion relation of a monochromatic plane wave : based on the intrinsic properties of physical waves any monochromatic plane particle wave then satisfies the wave equation .",
    "averaging density of the particle wave over a full period we get initially :    @xmath17    and the kinetic energy of particle motion is therefore ( @xmath18 denotes the volume of the particle ) :",
    "@xmath19    since kinetic energy is not constant but periodic , the result requires that an intrinsic potential exists , which yields an equivalent average of potential energy :    @xmath20    and total energy of the particle wave is then :    @xmath21    phase velocity of this particle wave equals , consistent with quantum theory , mechanical velocity of particle motion , although , contrary to quantum theory , no fourier integral over partial waves is required .",
    "therefore any monochromatic plane particle wave , consisting of oscillating mass and a complementary potential , describes motion of a _",
    "free particle _ :    @xmath22    from a theoretical point of view the existence of intrinsic potentials is a _ conjecture _ , it is more problematic than the original one based on inertial mass , since it implies the existence of physical variables not accounted for in the current framework of quantum theory .",
    "relating @xmath23 to total energy of the particle is , in this respect , not problematic , since experimentally energy of a particle can only be estimated by its state of motion or wavelength : and the relation between particle velocity @xmath24 , wavelength @xmath25 , and frequency @xmath26 is retained .      with the dispersion relation given by eq .",
    "[ ws013 ] the wave function @xmath27 and density @xmath28 of free particles comply with a wave equation :    @xmath29    the wave equations display intrinsic features of particle motion and possess , as will be seen in the following sections , the same dimensional level as electrodynamic formulations .",
    "the logical structure of physical statements is therefore modified : while in the standard procedure of quantum field theory the fundamental statements of quantum theory determine events on a micro level , and electromagnetic fields are logical superstructures , in the present context statements about the wave features of particles are different aspects of the same physical phenomena dealt within electrodynamics .",
    "this parallel development of electrodynamics and quantum theory from the same root  the intrinsic wave features of particles  must be understood in a literal sense , because the potentials deduced from mass oscillations will be related to electromagnetic fields .",
    "the schrdinger equation , in this context , is an expression of mechanical features ",
    "i.e. potential and kinetic energy  of particle motion . from the viewpoint of physical waves",
    "it is not without a certain degree of arbitrariness . to derive the relation we proceed from the periodic wave function eq .",
    "[ ws013 ] .",
    "then the time differential is given by :    @xmath30    kinetic energy @xmath31 of particle motion will therefore be :    @xmath32    and substituting eq .",
    "[ ws015 ] into [ ws016 ] we get for the kinetic energy of the particle :    @xmath33    if the total energy of a particle is equal to kinetic energy and a potential @xmath34 :    @xmath35    then the wave equation in the presence of an external potential is described by :    @xmath36    the relation is equivalent to a time  free schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it is important to consider , that this ( mechanical ) formulation of the wave equation explicitly relates physical potentials to kinetic energy and thus the wave  length of a material wave ( as a result of the laplace operator acting on @xmath0 ) and that , therefore , in a region , where @xmath34 takes successively different values , every kinetic energy and thus wave  length is generally possible .",
    "its interpretation in the context of material waves is not trivial , though .",
    "if the volume of a particle is finite , then wavelength and frequency become _ intrinsic _ variables of motion , which implies , due to energy conservation , that the wave function itself is a measure for the potential at an arbitrary point @xmath37 . if it is a measure for the physical conditions of the environment  i.e. the intensity of @xmath34 ",
    ", then it _ must _ have physical relevance .",
    "but if it has physical relevance , then the epr dilemma @xcite will be fully confirmed , and the result will favor einsteins s interpretation of quantum theory : quantum theory can not be complete under the condition that ( 1 ) particles do have finite dimensions , and ( 2 ) the schrdinger equation is a correct description of the variations of particle waves in the presence of external fields .",
    "the only alternative , which leaves quantum theory intact , is the assumption of particles with zero volume : an assumption which leads , in the context of electrodynamics , to the equally awkward result of infinite energy of particles .",
    "the first major result of this essay can therefore be formulated as follows :    * the interpretation of particles as physical waves allows the conclusion , that quantum theory can not be , in a logical sense , a complete theoretical description of micro physical systems .",
    "there exists another problem usually hidden in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory .",
    "let an external potential be given by @xmath34 .",
    "transforming eq .",
    "[ ws019 ] into a moving coordinate system @xmath38 described by :    @xmath39    we get the following equation :    @xmath40    since the variable @xmath41 in this case is undefined , the relation contains an element of arbitrariness .",
    "it is not conceivable , from this deduction , how a time  free schrdinger equation could be derived : if the time ",
    "dependent part of @xmath0 is eliminated , the procedure is equivalent to a transformation into a moving coordinate system , but in this case the potential becomes a function of time . and",
    "if the wave equation is integrated in the system at rest , then the wave functions depend on time .    from a physical point of view , the reduction of the schrdinger equation to its time ",
    "free form actually eliminates all the time ",
    "dependent interaction and adjustment processes bound to occur for _ every _ particle wave interacting with a changed environment",
    ". it may well be , that this disregard of development accounts for the commonly rather static concepts in quantum theory .      within the framework of material waves",
    ", the arbitrariness of the schrdinger equation can be referred to the intrinsic potential of mass oscillations , not accounted for in quantum theory . and its consequence , as can equally be derived ,",
    "is an uncertainty about the exact value of @xmath42 of the wave function @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath42 together with the period of intrinsic potentials @xmath44 is then sufficient to derive heisenberg s uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "to this aim we proceed from the schrdinger equation in the moving frame of reference eq .",
    "[ ws020 ] . setting the upper and lower limits of the potential @xmath45 to :    @xmath46    and calculating the correlating @xmath47vectors of the wave function @xmath48 :    @xmath49",
    "we get the following relation :    @xmath50    evaluating the relation in a one  dimensional model and accounting for the  yet unknown  variation of the potential @xmath51 by :    @xmath52    the uncertainty @xmath53 due to the undefined variable t will be :    @xmath54    if the uncertainty originates from the neglected intrinsic potential @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "[ ws011 ] ) , the uncertainty of the applied potentials is described by :    @xmath56    and therefore the uncertainty of @xmath47 can be referred to the value of @xmath47 :    @xmath57    the uncertainty does not result from wave  features of particles , as heisenberg s initial interpretation suggested @xcite , nor is it an expression of a fundamental physical principle , as the copenhagen interpretation would have it @xcite .",
    "it is , on the contrary , an expression of the _ minimum error _ ,",
    "inherent to _ any _ evaluation of the schrdinger equation , resulting from the fundamental assumption in quantum theory , i.e. the interpretation of particles as inertial mass aggregations .    since the distance between two potential maxima is given by",
    "( the value can deviate in two directions which yields total uncertainty of the @xmath58coordinate ) :    @xmath59    the uncertainty may equally be written as :    @xmath60    heisenberg actually derived @xcite the uncertainty relations @xmath61 .",
    "the fourier transform inherent to quantum theory suggests a correction of the constant eq .",
    "[ ws027 ] by a factor @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the deduction yields _ exactly _ the same result as the canonical formulation of quantum theory @xcite :    @xmath63    the minimum error due to intrinsic potentials is therefore equal to the uncertainty of quantum theory , and the logical relation between schrdinger s equation and the uncertainty relations is therefore a relation of reason and consequence : _ because _ schrdinger s relation is not precise by the value of intrinsic potentials , the uncertainty relations _ must be _ generally valid .",
    "this is the second major result of the present essay :    * _ because _ quantum theory neglects intrinsic characteristics of particle motion , the schrdinger equation is generally not precise by a value described by heisenberg s uncertainty relations .",
    "the result equally seems to settle the long  standing controversy between the _ empirical _ and the _ axiomatic _ interpretation of this important relation : it is not empirical , since it does not depend on any measurement process ; but it is equally not a physical principle , because it is due to the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory .",
    "the solution to the problem of interpretation is therefore a somewhat wider frame of reference : although within the principles of quantum theory the relation is an _ axiom _ , it is nonetheless a _ result _ of fundamental theoretical shortcomings and not a physical principle .      in the preceding section",
    "we could demonstrate , that quantum theory must not necessarily be a comprehensive representation of physical reality .",
    "it was shown , on the contrary , that the principal assumption of quantum theory , the assumption of inertial mass of particles , is a posteriori neither justified by the wave features of particles nor by the fundamental planck and de broglie relations .",
    "it is but _ one _ possible theoretical framework and , given the logical problems of a precise relation between measurements and reality arising from this concept , not even the best possible framework .    on an analytical level the establishment of fundamental relations of quantum theory within a different framework and their significance  that the uncertainty relations can also , and consistently , be interpreted as an expression of theoretical shortcomings due to a disregard of intrinsic properties  served to establish the limitations of the current theoretical standard .",
    "they also served to define the logical _ location _ of quantum theory and to determine the regions of interest , where research is commendable if a theory _ outside _ the current framework is taken into consideration .    from the viewpoint of theoretical synthesis we showed that the intrinsic properties of particles and their relations are a consequence of the experimental evidence of wave  features of particles .",
    "the de broglie relations , in a non ",
    "relativistic formulation , provided the essential laws by which these intrinsic variables are described .",
    "they allowed to establish ( 1 ) periodic mass  oscillations within the particle , and ( 2 ) the existence of a periodic potential .",
    "these results were sufficient to deduce the fundamental relations of quantum theory _ and _ , at the same time , to show their inherent limitations . apart from showing the significance of the periodic potentials",
    " which will be done in the following sections ",
    "the first two requirements mentioned in the introduction are therefore fulfilled .",
    "fundamental results of early quantum theory are reproduced ( schrdinger s relation as well as the uncertainty relations , while single experiments will be treated in the following sections ) , and the intrinsic wave features of particles were shown to be of _ physical _ significance , which strongly supports einstein s view in the epr paradox .",
    "classical electrodynamics is considered one of the most refined and powerful physical theories at hand .",
    "it served , during the last hundred years , ever again as a model for physical formalization , and its implications led to quite a few extensions of physical knowledge , not least albert einstein s theory of special relativity @xcite .",
    "a great deal of the fascination of classical electrodynamics results from its mathematical conciseness and brevity .",
    "the possibility to describe and account for most of the phenomena concerning interactions of charge by a set of basically four linear differential equations , the _ maxwell equations _",
    "@xcite , must either seem a lucky coincidence or an expression of a deeply rooted analogy in physical reality .",
    "that classical electrodynamics can not be referred to mechanical conceptions , has been proved during the scientific controversy about the existence of the ",
    "_ aether _  .",
    "this proposed medium of electromagnetic fields was never detected , its existence , furthermore , would contradict the experimental results of michelson and morley @xcite . from the theoretical side ,",
    "the controversy was settled by einstein s theory of relativity . since the correctness of maxwell s equations",
    "is established beyond doubt , it remains an epistemological problem , why no attempt to refer them to fundamental physical axioms has succeeded so far @xcite .",
    "summarizing the current situation in two statements : ( 1 ) maxwell s equations are correct , and ( 2 ) they can not be referred to mechanical axioms , there exist equally two logical conclusions to the epistemological problem : ( 1 ) maxwell s equations are themselves of an axiomatic nature , and ( 2 ) the axioms , on which they are based , have not yet been detected .",
    "currently , the established opinion is ( 1 ) .",
    "basically , one could leave it at this state and employ the relations as correct algorithms .",
    "from the viewpoint of macro physics , the procedure is justified by the wealth of experimental verifications at hand .",
    "the same does not apply , though , to an application of electrodynamics in micro physical models .",
    "since the exact origin of the relations is obscure , it can not be guaranteed , that they do not , in some way , preclude characteristics of physical systems , which contradict other assumptions .",
    "obviously , there exist only two ways out of this logical dilemma : either it can be proved , that quantum theory is logically independent of electrodynamics  a proof , which never has been given  , or it can be established that electrodynamics itself is based on micro physical axioms : in this case the current procedure in qed @xcite is logically insufficient .",
    "the logical conclusion to our epistemological problem would then be : ( 2  ) the maxwell relations are an expression of intrinsic characteristics of particles .",
    "based on the intrinsic wave characteristics of free particles , developed in the previous section , the verification of ( 2  ) does not present an impossible problem .",
    "the maxwell equations , in material wave theory , are an expression of longitudinal variations of intrinsic variables of particles in motion . from the wave equation for longitudinal momentum",

    "this interpretation , which focusses on the central notion of wave  particle  duality , states that all the qualities like polarization and interference , typical for a wave  type theory , have to be treated by electrodynamics , while energy and interaction phenomena must be seen from the viewpoint of quantum theory .",
    "the logical justification for retaining the duality , which is in itself a logical contradiction if wave  features and particle features were to prevail _ simultaneously _ , was seen by jordan @xcite and heisenberg @xcite in the impossibility of experiments ",
    "i.e. physical processes  where both aspects _ must _ simultaneously exist .",
    "this justification is not undisputed .",
    "renninger showed by a rather simple thought  experiment @xcite , that an interference measurement involving two separate light  paths does not allow for the probability  interpretation of electromagnetic field vectors , since the result of the measurement can be altered in a deterministic manner by the insertion of optical devices into a single light  path .",
    "the analysis of the experiment leads to the conclusion , that the wave  features _ must have _ physical significance , which again seems to confirm the epr dilemma already quoted @xcite .",
    "based on this experiment renninger deduced the following statement about the features of photons ( translation by the author , emphasizing by renninger ) :    _ every light  quantum consists of an energy  particle , which is guided by a wave without energy _",
    "the important result , from our point of view , is the physical significance of wave  features .",
    "the energy particle , which renninger refers to , is a direct result of einstein s interpretation of photo  electricity , which equally determines the interpretation of the guiding wave as energy  free .",
    "from the viewpoint of physical concepts , an energy  free _ physical _ wave is not all too convincing .",
    "if a region of space is altered by a propagating wave , thus the obvious objection , then it can not be without a physical entity moving .",

    "on thorougher analysis the necessity to divide between two separate physical entities to account for energy as well as electromagnetic features of photons depends on the interpretation of the interaction process itself .",
    "since ( 1 ) the quantum of energy is fully transferred , and ( 2 ) the transfer interval is well below the level of measurements , the energy must be contained in an insignificantly small volume .",
    "the alternative being , as renninger pointed out , that the wave will be contracted with a velocity exceeding @xmath96 during every interaction process .",
    "it is this interpretation of the interaction process , which will be changed by material wave theory . to understand the decisive modification , we present here  and without proof  a result on the interactions of electrons and photons , which will be derived later on .    assuming that the interaction interval equals , and setting @xmath97 for convenience equal to 1 , an intrinsic model of particles and fields will have to consider energy density at a specific point _ within _ the particle .",
    "if total energy density is constant and @xmath98 , then the time  derivative of energy density equals :    @xmath99    in this way the traditional features of photons are retained , while the meaning of the term _ energy quantum _ is modified : the energy quantum _ transferred _ in an interaction process equals @xmath100 , regardless of the actual volume of the photon , and equally regardless of the exact duration of the interaction process .",
    "as long as the total density of energy @xmath98 is constant , the relation holds for every single point of the underlying field and therefore for the whole region of the physical wave corresponding to a photon .",
    "now let us consider a case , where the initial photon is , by some optical device , split into two .",
    "if one of the partial volumes  a half photon so to say  then interacts with matter , the process is described by :    @xmath101    the energy density transferred remains constant , but not total energy .",
    "the process therefore _ seems _ to be a confirmation of the principle , that all interactions occur in discrete energy quanta only , if discrete quantities of mass or charge are considered .",

    "it only has to be considered , that the total volume affected by interactions will depend on the total volume of the  fractional  photon .    from this result",
    "it can be concluded , that the term _ energy quantum _ is not appropriate for the physical process of interaction : since the total energy transferred depends on ( 1 ) the frequency of radiation , and ( 2 ) the volume of the photon , total energy transferred is the product of energy density  proportional to frequency  and volume  which may be related to intensity . in an _",

    "the features of photons in material wave theory equally seem to fit into the framework of classical electrodynamics : electromagnetic field vectors are transversal , while the longitudinal component is purely kinetic . both aspects together",
    "provide a model of photons , which is simultaneously an extension of electrodynamics ( since the variables of motion exist in addition to the electromagnetic field ",
    "vectors ) , and an extension of quantum theory ( since the electromagnetic fields are not originally included in the kinetic model of quantum theory ) .",
    "relativistic electrodynamics only provides lorentz invariant formulations of intrinsic particle features , if energy quantities are evaluated .",
    "since the intrinsic potentials depend on the reference frame of evaluation and increase by a transformation into a moving coordinate system , the theory suggests that the infinity problems , inherent to relativistic quantum fields , may be related to the logical structure of qed .",
    "while the definition of magnetic fields eq .

    "so far the result is the traditional one . but",

    "if this change does not affect its hamiltonian , the only possible conclusion is , that photon energy has equally been changed , and that the energy acquired by acceleration has simultaneously been emitted by photon emission .",
    "the initial system was therefore over  determined , and the simultaneous existence of an external field _ and _ interaction photons is no physical solution to the interaction problem .",
    "the process of electron acceleration then has to be interpreted as a process of simultaneous photon emission : the acquired kinetic energy is balanced by photon radiation . a different way to describe the same result ,",
    "would be saying that electrostatic interactions are accomplished by an exchange of photons : the potential of electrostatic fields then is not so much a function of location than a history of interactions .",
    "this can be shown by calculating the hamiltonian of electron photon interaction :    @xmath205      since material wave theory is based on the intrinsic features of particles , it has to account for a problem , usually treated rather sloppily in quantum theory .",

    "electric and magnetic intensity @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and their relations were shown to be consequences of the internal structure of any single electron , electrodynamics in its traditional form therefore provides no answer to the question , by what means the alteration of internal structure is brought about .",
    "the argumentation of quantum theory in this respect is , strictly speaking , illegitimate , because it is not developed beyond the simple statement , that a specific momentum causes a specific wave packet . by what means",

    "the total value of energy transferred depends , in this context , on the region subject to interaction processes , and equally , as will be seen further on , on the duration of the emission process .",
    "the view taken in quantum theory is therefore only a good approximation : a thorougher concept , of which material wave theory in its present form is only the outline , will have to account for _ every _ possible variation in the interaction processes .",
    "but even on this , limited , basis of understanding , planck s constant , commonly considered the fundamental value of energy quantization is the fundamental constant not of energy values , but of transfer rates in dynamic processes .",
    "constant transfer rates furthermore have the consequence , that volume and mass values of photons or electrons become irrelevant : the basic relations for energy and dispersion remain valid regardless of actual quantities .",

    "but since the formalism of quantum theory is based on single _ eigenstates _ , meaning states of isolated particles , this logical structure is not accounted for by the mathematical foundations of quantum theory . while , therefore , the mathematical formalism suggests a validity beyond any actual measurement , it can only be applied to specific measurements .",

    "while for two separate charges the third consequence is of no effect , it can not be assumed a priori , that aggregations of charge typical for nuclear environments will provide a mode of photon interactions .",

    "the usual interpretation , the author concluded , which assumes quantum theory to be superior to local hidden variable theories , contains a biased interpretation of experimental data .",
    "the theoretical framework of material waves , which can be seen as an extension of electrodynamics to intrinsic particle properties , is basically a local theory .",
    "particle spin is a local variable , and the theory is therefore a realistic and local theory of  hidden variables  , although , and this seems to be an important difference to bohm s concept , classical electrodynamics _ and _ quantum theory were shown to result from specific limitations . on these grounds",
    "the conflict of a measurement presumably excluding hidden variables in a local theory and a concept which explicitly goes beyond the limits of formalization of the quantum theory , on which evaluation of these measurements is based ( like the current framework ) , can only be clarified by exclusion .",
    "if these measurements are also in the current framework valid _ within _ the limits of quantum theory , then the current framework must be ruled out , since it contradicts experimental evidence of a highly consistent and successful theory .",

    "a consistent framework therefore requires ( 1 ) a localized spin , and ( 2 ) a spin @xmath266 of bosons .",
    "the same calculation for the properties of electron spin yields the following result :    @xmath267    in principle the spin variable and the gyromagnetic ratio could be chosen like the values for photons . from the condition itself , the difference between bosons and fermions is not directly accessible .",
    "the difference can be accounted for , if the atomic model in quantum theory is considered : the theory of hydrogen fine structures by uhlenbeck and goudsmit @xcite requires two energy levels symmetric to the undisturbed one , thus a general multiplicity of 2 .",
    "the only solution , with this initial assumption , is a spin variable of @xmath268 and a gyromagnetic ratio of 2 .",
    "the direction of spin polarization is also for fermions equal to the direction of the magnetic field vector .",
    "generally the concept of spin seems questionable , because the frequency @xmath26 is not at all to be confused with rotation frequencies of a particle .",
    "consider , for example , a photon in uniform motion @xmath96 along a flat space ",
    "time geometry .",
    "its intrinsic magnetic field does not determine any state of rotation , nor does the energy of a photon result from the interaction of a photon magnetic moment with a magnetic field .",
    "from the given deduction of spin  properties of particles ( and the deduction seems highly appropriate , considering the effect of spin operators in the framework of quantum theory ) it seems , that the concept itself must be theoretically deficient .",
    "let us consider , on this basis , the result of any realistic measurement of photon  spin  in an epr  like situation @xcite .",
    "the first problem , we are confronted with , is the exact definition of the spin value . from the given deduction it seems evident , that the local direction of the spin vector is either parallel or antiparallel to the intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "provided , we adopt the view of quantum theory for spin conservation of two photons , then spin  up would mean , that the vector is antiparallel to @xmath71 , spin  down means , it must be parallel . in this case",
    "we have two photons with an arbitrary angle @xmath269 of polarization in the state + 1 for photon one and -1 for photon two ( see fig . [ fig001 ] ) .",
    "= 1.0    the second problem originates from the periodic features of the intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "since the magnetic field vector is periodic with @xmath270 , the spin variable _ can not _",
    "remain constant , but must oscillate from + 1 to - 1 .",
    "this oscillation requires , that we define the exact moment of measurement to obtain any valid result on the state of either particle .",
    "if the photon path remains constant in measurements , this requirement is fulfilled , but if , like in aspect s measurements @xcite , the measuring apparatus has to be rotated to account for different angles of observation , the effect on measurements seems not easy to estimate .",
    "this problem therefore leads to a problem of experimental methods , which is hidden in the usual argumentation of quantum theory .",
    "provided , the problem can be accounted for , our next problem is more substantial . since the spin variable oscillates , the measurement can only yield a definite result , if the variable is measured in the time ",
    "interval @xmath271 , which requires , that the local resolution of the measuring apparatus is below @xmath272 .",
    "now as demonstrated in the deduction of the uncertainty relations , this interval is equal to the lowest limit of local resolution in the framework of quantum theory .",
    "thus we get the result , that a valid measurement of the spin  variable must have a local precision which is explicitly beyond the fundamental uncertainty in quantum theory . if , therefore , the measurements yield any correlation related to physical processes , then the fundamental axioms of quantum theory must be violated .",
    "this result seems to turn the controversy about the epr paradox into a new direction .",
    "it can be established , that the mathematical framework of quantum theory , describing the state of either particle by a superposition of the two possible states @xmath244 1 is correct .",
    "but it can equally be established , that a significant correlation in spin  measurements is not , as einstein suspected , a proof of hidden variables or a contradiction in terms of special relativity , but a proof of measurements below the fundamental level of uncertainty .",
    "if this sort of measurement is possible , then the uncertainty relations are violated .    *",
    "if epr measurements are possible and yield a significant correlation for a pair of spin particles , then the uncertainty relations are violated .      in section [ sec_ed ]",
    "it was established , that electromagnetic radiation consists of two distinct intrinsic variables : ( 1 ) a longitudinal momentum , and ( 2 ) a transversal electromagnetic field , both variables depending on the frequency of radiation . in this section we found , that the change of energy density due to the adsorption of a photon result in motion of the absorbing electron , the energy increase given by :    @xmath273    if monochromatic x  rays therefore interact with free electrons , i.e. electrons with a velocity small compared to @xmath274 , then the absorbing electrons should move in longitudinal direction with a velocity equal to :    @xmath275    if this electron is decelerated , then it will emit electromagnetic radiation with a frequency described by :    @xmath276    and , depending on the duration of the deceleration process , the radiation can possess arbitrarily low frequency . this _ primary _ emission therefore will not exhibit discrete frequency levels .",
    "but if _ secondary _ processes are considered , then the frequency change will depend on ( 1 ) the relative velocity between the source of radiation and the moving electron , and ( 2 ) the emission and absorption characteristics .",
    "assuming , that the emission and absorption processes are symmetric in terms of duration , then the frequency of secondary emission will depend on the original frequency as well as the angle of emission .",
    "the model presented is therefore a simplification , and it can not be excluded , that a precise and deterministic picture of the whole process will not yield a deviating result . but compared to the standard model in quantum theory @xcite , it is nevertheless an improvement , because it does not have to recur to mechanical concepts .",
    "if the electron moves in longitudinal direction and with a velocity equal to @xmath277 , the frequency @xmath278 of the source will be changed due to the electromagnetic doppler effect .",
    "the secondary absorption process therefore has to account for a frequency @xmath279 :    @xmath280    an observer moving with the velocity @xmath277 of the electron will therefore measure changed frequencies and wavelengths of secondary emission .",
    "the wavelength @xmath281 will be :    @xmath282    the second term , the shift of wavelength due to longitudinal motion of the electron relative to the source of radiation , is the _ compton wavelength _ of an electron @xcite .",
    "it is the general shift of wavelength for every electromagnetic field , and an expression of longitudinal motion .",
    "@xmath283    additionally it has to be considered , that the reference frame of observation is the same as the reference frame of the original radiation , thus a second frequency shift depends on the angle of observation @xmath269 .",
    "measured from the direction of field propagation this additional shift will be :    @xmath284    and the overall shift of wavelength measured is therefore :    @xmath285    the result is equivalent to compton s measurements .",
    "compton scattering , in our view , is therefore a result of ( 1 ) secondary absorption and emission processes , and of ( 2 ) successive doppler shifts due to longitudinal motion of the emitting electrons .",
    "that classical electrodynamics does not provide a theoretical model for compton scattering , can be understood as a consequence of neglecting longitudinal and kinetic features of photons . since electromagnetic radiation in electrodynamics",
    "is interpreted from transversal properties alone ( which are periodic ) , a uniform longitudinal motion due to absorption processes is not within its theoretical limits .",
    "the possibility to account for quantum effects with the modified and still continuous model of electrons is strongly supporting , in our view , the validity of the unification of electrodynamics and quantum theory by formalizing the intrinsic features of particles .",
    "as it turns out , retrospectively , the theory of material waves removes the two fundamental problems , which made a physical interpretation ( as opposed to the probability ",

    "( 1 ) the contradiction between phase velocity and mechanical velocity of a particle wave is removed by the discovery of intrinsic potentials .",
    "( 2 ) the problem of intrinsic coulomb interactions is removed , because electrostatic interactions can be referred to an exchange of photons .",

    "it is difficult to estimate either the impact or the subsequent changes due to a concept , which completely deviates from the mainstream of current physics . the aim of establishing and , to a limited extent , interpreting a physical reality by an alternative framework was to provide a means , by which experimental results can be seen from at least two different points of view . the fundamental idea",

    ", it will reproduce any result the current framework provides , because the basic relations are not changed , merely interpreted in terms of electron and photon propagation .",
    "therefore an experiment , consistent with electrodynamics , will also be consistent with the new theory .",
    "in quantum theory , the only statements additional to the original framework are beyond the level of experimental validity , defined by the uncertainty relations .",
    "since quantum theory can not , in principle , contain results beyond that level , every experiment within the framework of quantum theory must necessarily be reproduced .",
    "that applies to the results of wave mechanics , which yields the eigenvalues of physical processes , as well as to the results of operator calculations , if von neumann s proof of the equivalence of schrdinger s equation and the commutator relations is valid .",
    "the only result , which could in this respect disprove the theory , is the spreading of a wave packet : but as this experimental result was the reason , that a _ physical _ interpretation of wave functions had to be discarded , the theory also in this respect seems to stand on firm ground .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "the same rule applies : the new theory only states , what is , in quantum theory , no part of a measurement result , therefore a contradiction can not exist .",
    "if , on the other hand , results in quantum electrodynamics exist , which are not yet verified by the new theory , then it is rather a problem of further development , but not of a contradiction with existing measurements .",

    "the same does not hold , though , for the verification of existing theoretical schemes of calculation by the new framework .",
    "since the theory extends far beyond the level of current concepts , established theoretical results may well be subject to revision .",
    "the theory of material waves requires , that every valid solution of a microphysical problem can be referred to physical properties of particle waves . in cases , where the established theory provides a solution yielding , for example , correct eigenvalues but not wave functions which can be identified as _ physical _ waves , the result is , from this viewpoint , questionable .",
