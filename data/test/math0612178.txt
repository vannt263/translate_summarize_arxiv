    "groups generated by finite automata ( groups of automata or automaton groups ) were formally introduced at the beginning of 1960 s  @xcite , but more substantial work on this remarkable class of groups started only in 1970 s after aleshin  @xcite confirmed a conjecture by glushkov  @xcite that these groups could be used to study problems of burnside type ( note that groups of automata should not be confused with automatic groups as described in  @xcite ) . it was observed in 1960 s and 1970 s that groups of automata are closely related to iterated wreath products ( pioneering work in this direction is due to kaloujnin  @xcite ) and that the theory of such groups could be studied by using the language of tables developed by kaloujnin  @xcite and sushchanskii  @xcite .",
    "even more intensive study of groups of finite automata started in the beginning of 1980 s after the development of some new ideas such as self - similarity , contracting properties , and a geometric realization as groups acting on rooted trees .",
    "these developments allowed for elegant constructions of burnside groups  @xcite and pushed the study of groups of automata in many directions : analysis  @xcite , geometry  @xcite , probability  @xcite , dynamics  @xcite , formal languages  @xcite , etc .",
    "two well known and important problems were solved using groups of automata in the early 1980 s , namely milnor problem  @xcite on intermediate growth and day problem  @xcite on amenability . a 5-state automaton constructed in  @xcite ( on the right in figure  [ 3automata ] ) generates a 2-group , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath0 has intermediate growth ( between polynomial and exponential ) .",
    "this led to construction of other examples of this type  @xcite and also made important contribution to and impact on the theory of invariant means on groups  @xcite initiated by von neumann  @xcite by providing an example of amenable , but not elementary amenable group ( in the sense of day  @xcite ) .    among the most interesting newer developments",
    "is the spectral theory of groups generated by finite automata and graphs associated to such groups  @xcite .",
    "for instance , automaton groups provided first examples of regular graphs realized as schreier graphs of groups for which the spectrum of the combinatorial laplacian is a cantor set  @xcite .",
    "further , the realization of the lamplighter group @xmath1 as automaton group ( bottom left in figure  [ 3automata ] ) was crucial in the proof that this group has a pure point spectrum ( with respect to a system of generators related to the states of the automaton ) and thus has discrete spectral measure , which was completely described  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , led to a construction  @xcite of a 7-dimensional closed manifold with non - integer third @xmath2-betti number providing a counterexample to the strong atiyah conjecture  @xcite .",
    "another fundamental recent discovery is the relation of groups of automata to holomorphic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "namely , it is shown that to every rational map @xmath3 on the riemann sphere with finite postcritical set one can associate a finite automaton generating a group , denoted @xmath4 and called iterated monodromy group of @xmath5 . the geometry and the topology of the schreier graphs of @xmath4 is closely related to the geometry of the julia set of @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ b - schreier5 ] depicts a schreier graph associated to an automaton group , denoted @xmath6 and called basilica group .",
    "its reminiscence to the julia set of the map @xmath7 is related to the fact that @xmath6 is the iterated monodromy group @xmath8 of the holomorphic map @xmath9  @xcite ) .",
    "groups of automata represent the basis of the theory of self - similar groups and actions  @xcite and are related to the study of belyi polynomials and dessins denfants of grothendieck  @xcite .",
    "the use of iterated monodromy groups was crucial in the recent solution of hubbard s twisted rabbit problem in  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important developments in the theory of automaton groups is the introduction of groups with branch structure , providing a link to just - infinite groups  @xcite and groups of finite width  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a problem suggested by zelmanov was solved by using the profinite completion of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the problem of gromov on uniformly exponential growth was solved recently by using branch automaton groups  @xcite .",
    "an unexpected link of groups of automata and their profinite completions to galois theory was found by r.  pink ( private communication ) and aitken , hajir and maire  @xcite , while n.  boston @xcite related branch groups of automata to fontaine - mazur conjecture and other problems in number theory .",
    "the class of branch groups is also a new source for infinitely presented groups , for which the presentation can be written in a recursive form ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a recent observation  @xcite is that automaton groups and their schreier graphs stand behind the famous hanoi towers problem ( see  @xcite ) and some of its generalizations  @xcite .",
    "there are indications that spectral properties of groups generated by finite automata could be used in the study of kaplansky conjecture on idempotents ( and thus also baum - connes conjecture  @xcite and novikov conjecture  @xcite ) , dixmier unitarizability problem  @xcite , and for construction of new families of expanders , and perhaps even ramanujan , graphs  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we are going to describe some progress which was achieved during the last few years in the problem of classification of automaton groups",
    ".    two important characteristics of an automaton are the cardinalities @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the set of states and the alphabet , respectively , and the pair @xmath12 is a natural measure of complexity of an automaton and of the group it generates .",
    "the groups of complexity @xmath13 are classified @xcite and there are only @xmath14 such groups ( see theorem  [ thm_class2states ] in section  [ sec_proofs ] here ) .",
    "the problem of classification of @xmath15 groups or @xmath16 groups is much harder .",
    "the current text represents the progress being made by the research group at texas a&m university over the last few years toward classification of @xmath15 groups .",
    "the total number of invertible automata of complexity @xmath15 is @xmath17 .",
    "however , the number of non - isomorphic groups generated by these automata is much smaller .",
    "there are no more than @xmath18 pairwise non - isomorphic groups of complexity @xmath15 .",
    "the proof of this theorem is too long to be presented here ( even the list of all groups takes a lot of space ) .    instead",
    ", we have chosen for this article a set of @xmath19 automata generating @xmath20 groups ( among the most interesting in this class , in our opinion ) , which we list in the form of a table .",
    "the table provided here is a part of the table listing the whole set of @xmath18 groups .",
    "we keep the numeration system from the whole table ( the rule for numeration is explained in section  [ sec_approach ] ) .",
    "major results obtained for the whole family are the following theorems . the numbers in the brackets indicate the numbers of corresponding automata in the class .",
    "there are @xmath14 finite groups in the class : @xmath21 [ 1 ] , @xmath22 [ 1090 ] , @xmath23 [ 730 ] , @xmath24 [ 847 ] , @xmath25 [ 802 ] and @xmath26 [ 748 ] .",
    "there are @xmath14 abelian groups in the class : @xmath21 [ 1 ] , @xmath22 [ 1090 ] , @xmath23 [ 730 ] , @xmath25 [ 802 ] , @xmath27 [ 731 ] and @xmath28 [ 771 ] .",
    "note that there are also virtually abelian groups in this class ( having @xmath29 , @xmath30 [ 2212 ] , @xmath31 [ 752 ] or @xmath32 [ 968 ] as subgroups of finite index ) .",
    "[ thm : class_free ] the only free non - abelian group in the class is the free group of rank 3 generated by the aleshin - vorobets automaton [ 2240 ] .",
    "moreover , the isomorphism class of this automaton group coincides with its equivalence class under symmetry .",
    "the definition of symmetric automata is given in section  [ sec_approach ] .",
    "there are no infinite torsion groups in the class .",
    "we do not provide the complete proofs of these theorems ( by the reason explained above ) .",
    "instead , we give here some information about each of the chosen groups and include proofs of most facts .",
    "properties that are in our focus are the contracting property , self - replication , torsion , relations ( we list the relators up to length @xmath33 ) , rank of quotients of the stabilizers series , shape of the related schreier graphs .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a general information about rooted trees and their automorphisms .",
    "then we provide quick introduction to the theory of automaton groups .",
    "we continue with the definition of schreier graphs and explain how they naturally appear for the actions on rooted trees . then we list @xmath19 automata generating @xmath20 groups together with some of their properties . in the last section we give proofs of many facts related to the groups in the list .",
    "the last part also contains some more general results ( such as an algorithm detecting transitivity of an element and a criterion for group transitivity on the binary tree ) .",
    "we recommend the articles  @xcite and the book @xcite to the reader who is interested in becoming more familiar with automaton groups .",
    "let @xmath34 be fixed and let @xmath35 be the alphabet @xmath36 .",
    "the set of words @xmath37 over @xmath35 ( the free monoid over @xmath35 ) can be given the structure of a _ regular rooted labeled @xmath38-ary tree _",
    "@xmath39 in which the empty word @xmath40 is the _ root _ , the _ level _ @xmath11 in @xmath39 consists of the words of length @xmath11 over @xmath35 and every vertex @xmath41 has @xmath38 children , labeled by @xmath42 , for @xmath43 .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the group of automorphisms of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath5 be an automorphism in @xmath44 .",
    "any such automorphism can be decomposed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , for @xmath43 , are automorphisms of @xmath39 and @xmath47 is a permutation of @xmath35 .",
    "the automorphisms @xmath46 ( also denoted by @xmath48 ) , @xmath43 , are called ( the first level ) _ sections _ of @xmath5 and each one acts as an automorphism on the subtree @xmath49 hanging below the vertex @xmath50 in @xmath39 consisting of the words in @xmath37 that start with @xmath50 ( any such subtree is canonically isomorphic to the whole tree ) .",
    "the action of @xmath5 is decomposed in two steps .",
    "first the @xmath38-tuple @xmath51 acts on the @xmath38 subtrees hanging below the root , and then the permutation @xmath47 , called the _ root permutation _ of @xmath5 , permutes these @xmath38 subtrees .",
    "thus the action of @xmath5 from on @xmath37 is given by @xmath52 for @xmath50 a letter in @xmath35 and @xmath53 a word over @xmath35 .",
    "further iterations of the decomposition ( [ decomposition ] ) yield the second level sections @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and so on .",
    "algebraically , we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the _ permutational wreath product _ in which the coordinates of @xmath58 are permuted by @xmath59",
    ".    iterations of the decomposition   show that @xmath44 has the structure of an iterated wreath product @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath44 is a pro - finite group and in particular , all of its subgroups are residually finite . an obvious and natural sequence of normal subgroups of finite index intersecting trivially is the sequence of level stabilizers . the @xmath11-th _ level stabilizer _",
    "@xmath61 of a group @xmath62 consists of those tree automorphisms in @xmath63 that fix the vertices in @xmath39 up to level @xmath11 .",
    "the group @xmath44 is obviously an uncountable object .",
    "we are interested in finitely generated subgroups of @xmath44 that exhibit some important features of @xmath44 .",
    "one such feature is self - similarity .",

    "the full tree automorphism group @xmath44 is clearly self - similar ( see ( [ fxw ] ) ) .",

    "the action of @xmath77 on @xmath39 is given recursively by @xmath78 .",
    "the group generated by the automorphisms @xmath75 is finitely generated self - similar group of automorphisms of @xmath39 .",

    "an _ initial automaton _",
    "@xmath89 is just an automaton @xmath79 with a distinguished state @xmath90 selected as an initial state .",
    "we first informally describe the action of the initial automaton @xmath89 on @xmath37 .",
    "the automaton starts at the state @xmath85 , reads the first input letter @xmath91 , outputs the letter @xmath92 and changes its state to @xmath93 .",
    "the rest of the input word is handled by the new state @xmath94 in the same fashion ( in fact it is handled by the initial automaton @xmath95 ) .",
    "formally , the action of the states of the automaton @xmath79 on @xmath37 can be described by extending the output function @xmath96 to a function @xmath97 recursively by @xmath98 for all states @xmath85 in @xmath82 , letters @xmath43 and words @xmath53 over @xmath35 .",
    "then the action of the initial automaton @xmath89 is defined by @xmath99 , for words @xmath100 over @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , ( [ rhoext ] ) shows that each initial automaton @xmath89 , @xmath90 , defines a tree automorphism , denoted by @xmath85 , defined by @xmath101 where the section @xmath102 is the state @xmath103 and the root permutation @xmath104 is the permutation @xmath105 .",
    "given an automaton @xmath81 , the group of tree automorphisms generated by the states of @xmath79 is denoted by @xmath106 and called the _ automaton group _ defined by @xmath79 . the generating set @xmath82 is called the _ standard _ generating set of @xmath106 .",
    "_ boundary _ of the tree @xmath39 , denoted @xmath107 , is the set @xmath108 of words over @xmath35 that are infinite to the right ( infinite geodesic rays in @xmath39 starting at the root ) .",
    "it has a natural metric ( infinite words are close if they agree on long finite prefixes ) and the group of isometries @xmath109 is canonically isomorphic to @xmath44 .",
    "thus the action of the automaton group @xmath106 on @xmath39 can be extended to an isometric action on @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , and are valid for infinite words @xmath53 as well .",
    "an automaton @xmath79 can be represented by a labeled directed graph , called moore diagram , in which the vertices are the states of the automaton , each state @xmath85 is labeled by its own root permutation @xmath104 and , for each pair @xmath110 , there is an edge from @xmath85 to @xmath111 labeled by @xmath50 .",
    "for example , the 5-state automaton in the right half of figure  [ 3automata ] generates the group @xmath0 mentioned in the introduction ( @xmath112 denotes the permutation exchanging @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the two 2-state automata given on the left of figure  [ 3automata ] are the so called _ adding machine _ ( top ) , which generates the infinite cyclic group @xmath29 and the _ lamplighter automaton _ ( bottom ) generating @xmath115 .",
    "recursion relations of type ( [ f^0 ] ) for the adding machine and the lamplighter automaton are given by @xmath116 respectively .",
    "various classes of automaton groups deserve special attention .",
    "an automaton group @xmath117 is _ contracting _ if there exist constants @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , such that @xmath122 , for all vertices @xmath41 of length at least @xmath120 and @xmath123 ( the length is measured with respect to the standard generating set @xmath82 )",
    ". for sufficiently long elements @xmath64 this means that the length of its sections at vertices on levels deeper than @xmath120 is strictly shorter than the length of @xmath64 .",
    "this length shortening leads to an equivalent definition of a contracting group .",
    "namely , a group @xmath63 of tree automorphisms is contracting if there exists a finite set @xmath124 , such that for every @xmath125 , there exists @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 for all vertices @xmath128 of length not shorter than @xmath120 . the minimal set @xmath129 with this property",
    "is called the _ nucleus _ of @xmath63 .",
    "the contraction property is a key feature of various inductive arguments and algorithms involving the decomposition @xmath130 .",
    "another important class is the class of automaton groups of _ branch type_. branch groups arise as one of the three  @xcite possible types of just - infinite groups ( infinite groups for which all proper homomorphic images are finite ) .",
    "every infinite , finitely generated group has a just - infinite image . thus if a class of groups @xmath131 is closed under homomorphic images and if it contains infinite , finitely generated examples then it contains just - infinite examples .",
    "such examples are , in a sense , minimal infinite examples in @xmath131 .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is a branch automaton group that is a just - infinite 2-group .",
    "i.e. , it is an infinite , finitely generated , torsion group that has no proper infinite quotients .",
    "also , the hanoi towers group  @xcite and the iterated monodromy group @xmath132  @xcite are branch groups , while @xmath133 is not a branch group , but only weakly branch ( for definitions see  @xcite ) .    the class of _ polynomially growing automata _ was introduced by sidki in  @xcite , where it is proved that no group @xmath106 defined by such an automaton contains free subgroups of rank 2 .",
    "moreover , for a subclass of so called _ bounded automata _ it is known that the corresponding groups are amenable  @xcite ( this class of automata , for instance , includes the automata generating @xmath0 , @xmath6 and hanoi towers group on @xmath134 pegs , but not for more pegs ) .",
    "finally , self - replicating groups play an important role .",
    "a self - similar group @xmath63 is called _ self - replicating _ if , for every vertex @xmath100 , the homomorphism @xmath135 from the stabilizer @xmath100 in @xmath63 to @xmath63 , given by @xmath136 , is surjective .",
    "this condition is usually easy to check and , together with transitivity of the action on level 1 , it implies transitivity of the action on all levels . another way to show that a group of automorphisms of the binary tree is level transitive is to use proposition  [ prop : transitivity ] .",
    "let us fix some self - similar contracting group acting on @xmath137 by automorphisms . denote by @xmath138 the space of left infinite sequences over @xmath35 .",
    "two elements @xmath139 are said to be _ asymptotically equivalent _ with respect to the action of the group @xmath63 , if there exist a finite set @xmath140 and a sequence @xmath141 of elements in @xmath142 such that @xmath143 for every @xmath144 .",
    "the asymptotic equivalence is an equivalence relation .",
