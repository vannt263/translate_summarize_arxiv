    "4u  170544 is a neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) classified as an atoll source ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",

    "the x - ray spectrum of compton reflection has a characteristic shape resulting from photoelectric absorption at low energies and compton scattering ( including its recoil ) at higher energies , with a broad hump around 30 kev .",

    ", we fit the data with several physical models , while trying to minimize the number of free parameters . each time a new component is added to the model , the f - test ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) is performed ( but note caveats to its validity in certain cases , protassov et al .  2002 ) . during spectral",

    "* @xmath16 epoch .",
    "the jem - x and ibis observations of mjd 5291452916 and 5304453060 , in the hard / low state .    the simplest model which provides a reasonable fit to the _ bepposax _ data consists of the sum of a thermal comptonization component , modeled in xspec by ( titarchuk 1994 ; spherical geometry was assumed ) , a soft component modeled by a single temperature blackbody , and a gaussian fe line at 6.4 kev with the width , @xmath29 .",

    "initially , the fe line centroid energy was let free ; however , our fits show it to be always consistent with the neutral - fe value of 6.4 kev , and hence it has been fixed at that value hereafter .    adding compton reflection to the fit , using the xspec model ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , resulted in a substantial fit improvement for epoch 2 , reducing @xmath37d.o.f .  from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the low f - test chance probability of @xmath40 .",
    "the inclination angle , @xmath41 , of the reflecting medium has been kept at @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , which is consistent with the allowed range found by di salvo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of @xmath44@xmath45 from _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the strength of reflection is measured by the solid angle , @xmath46 , subtended by the reflection , with @xmath47 corresponding to reflection from a slab completely covering the disk .",

    ", the main parameters agree with ones reported by bo02 , with only exception of the blackbody temperature , which is now slightly higher in the hard state .",
    "the _ integral _ data have been fitted with a model similar to that used for the _ bepposax _ data ( but initially without compton reflection ) .",
    "however , since both the energy resolution of jem - x , @xmath49 ( fwhm ) at 6.4 kev is not adequate to study the fe line properties and the usable jem - x data are for @xmath50 kev only , we do not include the line in the present model .",
    "the seed soft temperature and the column density are now frozen at their respective values obtained from the _ bepposax _ data .",
    "this model gives adequate values of @xmath51d.o.f .",
    "for the data sets of epochs 3 and 4 , 128/111 and 129/118 , respectively . however , we find the fitted blackbody temperature for the hard state , epoch 4 , to be extremely high , 6.1 kev , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "the corresponding component , yielding a hump around @xmath12030 kev , is very well reproduced by compton reflection .",
    "similary to the case of the _ bepposax _ data , we add the compton reflection to the fit .",

    ", we obtain an unacceptable @xmath53 . a higher value , @xmath54 kev is required by the data .",
    "therefore , we now fit both the _ bepposax _ and _ integral _ soft states with two blackbody components and set @xmath55 equal to the lower value of their temperatures , @xmath56 .",
    "this reduces @xmath51d.o.f .  from 578/423 to 567/422 for the epoch 1 and from 195/110 to 120/109 for the epoch 3 , with the low corresponding f - test chance probabilities of @xmath40 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "using this model , the reflection component becomes statistically highly significant for the epoch 1 , reducing @xmath51d.o.f .  from 632/423 to 567/422 , which corresponds to the f - test chance probability of @xmath58 .",

    "[ sax1 ] and [ int1 ] for the _ bepposax _ and _ integral _ data , respectively .    summarizing the above results , the energy spectra of 4u  170544 can be fitted by the sum of one ( in the hard state ) or two ( in soft state ) blackbody components , a thermal - comptonization component and a 6.4 kev fe line , in agreement with the results of bo02 .",
    "we find two new results .",
    "first , two soft blackbody components are required by the data in the soft state .",
    "second , we find strong signature of compton reflection .",
    "the four models are compared in fig .",
    "[ models ] .",
    "we clearly see the distinct difference between the hard and soft states .",
    "the bolometric model luminosities ( obtained in the 0.1200 kev range ) are @xmath59 erg s@xmath60 and @xmath61 erg s@xmath60 , for the soft - state epochs 1 and 3 , respectively , assuming the distance of @xmath62 kpc @xcite .",
    "they correspond to 22% and 39% , respectively , of the eddington luminosity , @xmath63 , for @xmath64 and the standard abundances .",
    "most , @xmath65 , of the source flux , is radiated below 20 kev .",
    "the bolometric model luminosities are @xmath66 erg s@xmath60 and @xmath67 erg s@xmath60 , for the hard - state epochs 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "they correspond to 7% and 10% of @xmath63 .",
    "they are both lower than those in the soft state , in agreement with the usual ranking of the luminosity of these two states , in particular in atoll sources ( e.g. , hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; van der klis 2000 ; gierliski & done 2002 ) .",
    "the electron temperatures are now substantially higher than in the soft state , @xmath6850 kev , and the comptonization component extends above @xmath69 kev",
    ".    the seed - photon temperatures are consistent with values typical for neutron - star lmxbs , @xmath701.5 kev @xcite .",
    "the blackbody temperatures of the second , hotter , component are relatively high during the soft states .",
    "we note that similar high temperatures have been found by bo02 in their soft - state _ rxte _ observations .",
    "also , they found that the blackbody temperature increases with the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we confirm this trend for the _ integral _ soft state , which has @xmath71 higher than those of bo02 , and for which the both blackbody temperatures are higher than the values reported by those authors . on the other hand , no significant variations of either @xmath72 or @xmath30 have been detected , with our values consistent with those of bo02 and langmeier et al .",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "we have also estimated the sizes of the regions emitting the seed photons for comptonization , assuming their emission as blackbody ( following in t zand et al .",
    "we obtain @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the luminosity in the comptonization component .",
    "here , we have estimated the amplification factor of the seed luminosity by the comptonization as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the comptonization parameter , @xmath77 .",
    "the obtained values are given in table [ fit ] , and are in the range between 7 and 80 km .",
    "as one of our main results , we have found two blackbody components required by the data in the soft state .",
    "the hotter one is likely originating from a part of the neutron star surface or the innermost part of the disk , with @xmath782.2 kev and the radius of few km .",
    "the colder one , @xmath79 kev , is likely produced farther away from the neutron star , @xmath80 km .",
    "our fitted values of the radius in the unscattered blackbody component are much less than the inferred radius of the blackbody photons scattered by a surrounding hot plasma .",
    "this is an indication that most of those colder blackbody photons undergo compton scattering . in the hard state ,",
    "only one blackbody component at a low temperature , @xmath810.7 kev , is present .",
    "its emission region radius is constrained mostly by the _",
    "data to @xmath82 km , which most likely corresponds to the stellar surface ( cf .",
    "olive , barret & gierliski 2003 ) .",
    "the comptonization component may arise from a corona above the disk and/or between the disk and the stellar surface .",
    "the obtained values of the electron temperature are typical for neutron - star lmxbs , but lower than those seen in the hard state of black - hole binaries , @xmath83 kev ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; di salvo et al .",
    "2001 ; zdziarski & gierliski 2004 ) .",
    "we also find the electron temperature to be higher in the hard state .",
    "although barret et al . 2001 observed spectral state transitions without significant variations in the total x - ray luminosity , we found that they are accompanied by changes in luminosity , indicating they are driven by variability of the accretion rate that is lower in the hard state , and higher in the soft state .",
    "for an accretion efficiency of @xmath84 ( corresponding , e.g. , to @xmath85 and @xmath86 km ) and using our model luminosities , @xmath71 , we find @xmath87 yr@xmath60 , @xmath88 yr@xmath60 , @xmath89 yr@xmath60 and @xmath90 yr@xmath60 .",
    "they are apparently accompanied by changes the geometry of the flow , and the relative contribution of the blackbody - like and comptonization components . in the soft state ,",
    "the blackbody components are much stronger than in the hard state .",
    "the spectral evolution of atoll sources could be explained in the framework of a model consisting of a truncated accretion disk with a hot inner flow ( e.g. , bo02 ; olive et al .",
    "the truncation radius of the disk is the critical parameter of this model , as the disk represents a major source of cooling for the comptonizing plasma . in the hard states ,",
    "accretion probably assumes the form of a truncated outer accretion disk and a hot inner flow , joining the disk and the stellar surface .    in the two",
    "_ bepposax _ data sets , we have detected a line emission which we interpret as k - shell fluorescent emission of low ionization states of fe .",
    "for the first time in the source , we have detected strong signatures of compton reflection .",
    "earlier , compton reflection was detected in a number of neutron - star lmxbs , e.g. , 4u 1608522 ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ; gierliski & done 2002 ) , gs 1826238 ( zdziarski et al .  1999 ;",

    "we note , however , that we find a strong fe line in the epoch 2 , when the reflection is weak .",
    "this indicates that the line flux and the reflection strength may not be always correlated , which could indicate these components originate from different region .",
    "although _ bepposax _ data strongly support this indication , better quality data at low energy are necessary to address this behavior .",
    "the large width of the fe line detected in the epoch 2 could be due to either blending of several ionization states , relativistic effects in the accretion disk , or compton broadening in a surrounding corona .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not allow us to measure the detailed profile of the line , that would discriminate between these hypotheses .",
    "we note that the latter is also the case for the _ chandra _ data @xcite , and that the large effective areas of _ xmm - newton _ would probably give sufficient statistics to determinate the origin of the line width .",

    "<S> we present data from _ integral _ and _ bepposax _ satellites showing spectral state transitions of the neutron - star , atoll - type , low - mass x - ray binary 4u  170544 . </S>",
    "<S> its energy spectrum can be described as the sum of one or two blackbody components , a 6.4-kev fe line , and a component due to thermal comptonization . in addition , and for the first time in this source , we find a strong signature of compton reflection , presumably due to illumination of the optically - thick accretion disk by the comptonization spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the two blackbody components , which the soft - state data require , presumably arise from both the disk and the neutron - star surface . </S>",
    "<S> the comptonization probably takes place in a hot inner flow irradiated by some of the blackbody photons . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral transitions are shown to be associated with variations in the bolometric luminosity , most likely proportional to the accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> indipendentely from the spectral state , we also see changes in the temperature of the comptonizing electrons and the strength of compton reflection . </S>"
