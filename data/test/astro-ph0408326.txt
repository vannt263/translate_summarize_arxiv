    "nuclear spirals are known to be preponderant in active galaxies ( reagan & mulchaey 1999 ; martini et al .",
    "they have a variety of morphology , from the grand - design symmetric two - armed spirals to chaotic ones ( martini et al .",
    "the flocculent nuclear spirals are considered to be formed by the acoustic instability proposed by montenegro , yuan , & elmegreen ( 1998 ) , whereas the grand - design nuclear spirals are thought to be formed by the hydrodynamical instability caused by the gas inflow driven by the non - axisymmetric potentials ( englmaier & shlosman 2000 ) .",
    "it is well known that the response of gaseous disk to the imposed non - axisymmetric potentials depends not only on the potential shape of the model galaxy but also on the hydrodynamic properties of the gaseous disk ( ann & lee 2000 ; englmaier & shlosman 2000 ; maciejewski et al .",
    "however , the effects of smbhs on the gas flow inside the ilrs have not been studied much . here",
    ", we present some results of numerical experiments including smbh for the formation of nuclear spirals , based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "we have assumed that a barred galaxy is made up of three stellar components ( bulge , disk , bar ) and two dark ones ( smbh , halo ) .",
    "we adopt simple analytic forms for the potential generated by each component .",
    "the properties of all the potential generating components are assumed to be invariant in time .",
    "we considered mass models which are thought to resemble early type galaxies ( @xmath0 sba ) by assuming the bulge - to - disk mass ratios as @xmath1 .",
    "we assumed a strong bar which has the fractional mass of 0.2 and the axial ratio ( a / b ) as 3 .",
    "the bar rotation period is @xmath2 years .",
    "we used isothermal assumption for the gas but we explored the effect of gas temperature by varying the sound speed of gas .",
    "we adopted @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the artificial viscosity coefficients .",
    "the self - gravity of gas was also included .",
    "fig . 1 shows snapshots of the evolution of the nuclear regions of gaseous disks at the evolution time of 20 bar rotations .",
    "the three models have the same mass distributions except for the central smbhs .",
    "the model m1 has no smbh , while the other two models ( m2 , m3 ) have a smbh whose mass is about @xmath5 of the total mass of the visible components ( disk , bulge and bar ) but they assumed different sound speeds in the gas ; 10 km / s for m2 and 15 km / s for m3 .",
    "the sound speed in the gas of m1 model is the same as that of the model m2 .    as shown clearly in fig .",
    "1 , the nuclear regions of the gaseous disk of m1 model evolves to leading spirals between the iilr and oilr , whereas those of m2 and m3 develop trailing spirals whose detailed shapes depend on the sound speeds in the gas .",
    "the cold gaseous disk assumed in the model m2 shows ring - like spirals , while the hot gaseous disk of the model m3 shows tightly wound spirals whose innermost parts reach close to the center .",
    "thus , it seems quite clear that the tightly wound trailing nuclear spirals can be developed in the hot interstellar medium when there is a smbh whose mass is large enough to remove the iilr .",
    "this is the reason why nuclear spirals are frequently observed in active galaxies .",
