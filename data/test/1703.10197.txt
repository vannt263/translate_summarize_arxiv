    "mbb models with an emissivity index in the usual range ( @xmath86 ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these mass measurements are summarized in table [ tab;mass ] .",
    "if we adopt the galactic conversion factor , the baryonic mass fraction , defined as @xmath92 , exceeds unity .",
    "monte carlo simulations incorporating the uncertainties of gas , stellar and dynamical mass show that the probability of the baryonic mass fraction being less than one is 2.3% for u4 - 16795 and 17.1% for u4 - 16504 . in the case of the starburst conversion factor ,",
    "the probability is increased to 24.7% and 55.3% , respectively .",
    "we also independently constrain the gas mass from the 3 mm - based dust mass , assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 120 @xcite .",
    "the 5@xmath42 upper limit is @xmath93 ( table [ tab;mass ] ) .",
    "the two independent approaches suggest that the starburst conversion factor is appropriate in the compact dusty star - forming region . adopting the starburst conversion factor to derive the co - based gas mass , we find the gas - to - dynamical mass fraction to be @xmath94 for u4 - 16795 and @xmath95 for u4 - 16504 and the gas depletion timescale to be @xmath96 myr and @xmath97 myr , respectively .",
    "when the uncertainties of the conversion factor are taken into consideration , those in the gas mass estimate become larger .",
    "using alma observations of co @xmath0 emission , we find that the compact molecular gas in the star - forming cores of two massive galaxies is rapidly rotating .",
    "this has implications for both the formation and subsequent evolution of the cores of massive galaxies .",
    "the formation mechanism appears to be dissipative and the observed rotation indicates that at least some angular momentum is preserved in the star - forming molecular gas .",
    "simulations show this could happen due to a gas - rich merger or disk instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two massive star - forming galaxies are both rotation - dominated with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "kinematic studies of massive quiescent galaxies suggest they are rotating @xcite , although with lower @xmath12 than found here for their progenitors . additionally , the descendants of these galaxies in the local universe are slow rotators with @xmath12 nearly an order of magnitude lower , suggesting that the galaxies we observe need to lose significant net angular momentum in the intervening time .",
    "our results support a picture in which net angular momentum is initially reduced during the quenching process and further during a growth phase by dry mergers .",
    "we find that the molecular gas of the two massive galaxies at @xmath1 is compact with @xmath100 kpc .",
    "such a concentration of star - forming gas is consistent with a scenario in which a wet compaction events ( radial transport of gas ) could build the cores of massive galaxies @xcite . the two galaxies host even more compact starbursts with a high sfr surface density as traced by the dust continuum emission , rapidly building up dense cores and transforming the galaxy morphology from disk - dominated to bulge - dominated @xcite .",
    "if the gas mass in these galaxies is as low as our data suggest , we may be witnessing the end of the growth of these dense cores due to star formation .",
    "our independent measurements of dynamical , stellar , gas and dust mass suggest that the starburst co - to - h@xmath13 conversion factor is appropriate for the spatially resolved cores .",
    "these dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments like central regions of local ulirgs .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained by recent [ c  i ]  observations of a star - forming galaxy in the similar mass and redshift range @xcite and co observations of starburst galaxies above the main - sequence @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear yet that the starburst conversion factor is appropriate for entire galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigated the variations in molecular gas properties for 650 galaxies over @xmath101 by compiling co and dust continuum data and does not find the presence of such a large change in the conversion factor .",
    "a statistical study of the kinematics of the molecular gas is an essential next step for getting a consensus on this issue .",
    "however , high - spatial resolution co observations suffer from missing flux and are more time - consuming compared to dust continuum observations .",
