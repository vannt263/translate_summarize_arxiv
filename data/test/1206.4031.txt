    "the discovery of a new class of faint dwarf satellites around the milky way ( mw ; see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) ) and the andromeda galaxies ( m31 ; see e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) has opened a new window for the study of the formation history of large spirals .",
    "the new systems show a number of remarkable differences with respect to the `` classical '' dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) surrounding the mw and m31 : i ) they have much lower surface brightnesses ( @xmath11  mag ) , for which they were named `` ultra - faint '' dwarfs ( ufds ) ; ii ) they are very metal poor , with large dispersions and [ fe / h ] values as low as @xmath12 dex ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "such extreme abundances are not observed among the classical dsphs where only a few stars with [ fe / h]@xmath13 have been detected @xcite compared to the large number found in the mw halo ; iii ) they generally contain rr lyrae stars that conform to the subdivision into oosterhoff types i ( oo i ) and ii ( ooii ; * ? ? ?",

    "so far , the only exception among the ufds is canes venatici i ( cvn i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the brightest of the mw ufds , that , like the classical mw dsphs , has instead oosterhoff - intermediate ( oo - int ) properties ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; and , finally : iv ) the ufds discovered so far outnumber by almost a factor of two the classical dsphs , thus partially reducing the so - called `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite affecting the @xmath15-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath15cdm ) scenario of galaxy formation . with their properties",
    "the ufds are potentially much better analogues than the classical dsphs of the `` building blocks '' that contributed to the formation of the two large spirals in the local group .",
    "they have absolute luminosities similar to the globular clusters ( gcs ; @xmath16 mag , on average ) but they are much more spatially extended than gcs . with typical half - light radii of @xmath17 100 pc , in fact they equal in size the `` classical '' dsphs .",
    "the ufds are found in groups on the sky ( see e.g. fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have small velocity dispersions , and high mass - to - light ratios .",
    "all ufds host an ancient population around 10 gyr old .",
    "they have gc - like color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) resembling the cmds of metal - poor galactic gcs ( ggcs ) such as m92 ( ngc  6341 ) , m15 ( ngc  7078 ) and m68 ( ngc  4590 ) . some of the mw ufds have a distorted shape due to the tidal interaction with the mw .",
    "we are carrying out an extensive observational campaign of the new mw and m31 ufds to study structural parameters and stellar population properties , as well as the variable stars of these systems .",
    "we have already published results for bootes i ( boo i , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cvn i @xcite , canes venatici ii ( cvnii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , coma @xcite , leo iv @xcite , and ursa major ii ( umaii * ? ? ?",
    "* ) among the mw ufds . with the only exception of cvn i",
    ", all these dwarfs contain rr lyrae stars with pulsation periods suggesting an oo ii classification .",
    "however , only boo i and cvn i contain sufficiently large numbers of variables to be safely classified into oosterhoff types .",
    "the classification of the other ufds is less certain given the small numbers of variables they contain .",
    "nevertheless , their few variables clearly tend to have oosterhoff type ii properties .",
    "thus , in terms of stellar metallicity and pulsation properties of the variable stars , systems similar to the ufds , as they were at earlier times , could resemble the building blocks of the galactic halo .    in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis to the hercules ufd galaxy ( r.a.@xmath18 , decl.@xmath19 , j2000.0 ) .",
    "the galaxy was discovered by @xcite from the analysis of sdss data .",
    "the cmd of hercules ( based on follow - up isaac newton telescope - int- data ) shows besides the red giant branch ( rgb ) , also blue and red horizontal branches ( hbs ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted this evidence as a possible signature of multiple stellar populations present in the galaxy .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to this galaxy after the discovery paper .",
    "cmds of hercules reaching well below the galaxy s main sequence turn - off were published by ( * ? ? ?",

    "there are several spectroscopic and photometric determinations of the metallicity of hercules .",
    "these studies confirm that hercules shows a spread in metal abundance , with values of the mean metallicity @xmath25 } \\rangle$ ] ranging from about @xmath262.0 to @xmath262.7 dex @xcite .",
    "the line of sight towards the hercules dsph galaxy is heavily contaminated by galactic foreground stars , making it hard to determine membership from the cmd alone . even when radial velocities are added the selection remains uncertain , because the mean velocity of the hercules dsph galaxy coincides with the velocity of the thick disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , in the @xcite cmd , based on strmgren photometry obtained with the wide field camera of the int , the rgb of hercules is not easily identified due to the halo foreground contamination .",
    "these authors used the c1 index in the strmgren system to disentangle the galaxy s rgb and hb stars from the foreground contamination .",
    "hercules appears to be highly elongated .",
    "the galaxy s structural parameters were obtained by a number of different authors @xcite who , fitting different stellar profiles to their independent photometric datasets , found similar values for the galaxy s central position , position angle ( @xmath27 ) , and ellipticity ( @xmath28 ) , but rather different half - light radii . in a recent analysis ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the density profiles of relaxed , tidally stripped dwarf spheroidals like hercules are better approximated by a plummer law .",
    "moreover , @xcite clearly point out the need for deep photometry in order to properly constrain the structural parameters of the new faint mw satellites . in the following",
    ", we shall adopt the structural parameters obtained by @xcite assuming a plummer stellar distribution , namely @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "hercules has no evidence of internal rotation , and a very low velocity dispersion of @xmath32 km s@xmath33 for @xcite or 3.72 km s@xmath33 for @xcite .",
    "the explanation of such a large ellipticity in absence of a rotational support might imply that hercules is not in dynamical equilibrium due to strong tidal distortions ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latest studies estimate distances in the range of @xmath34 kpc to @xmath35 kpc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the study presented in this paper is based on @xmath38 photometric time - series imaging covering a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath39 ( see table  [ t : obs ] ) , extending well beyond hercules half - light radius .",
    "these data have allowed us to obtain a complete inventory of the variable stars belonging to the galaxy and to trace the corresponding parent stellar populations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the observations and the data reduction procedures ; section 3 is devoted to the variable stars , whereas the cmds and the implications for the structure of the hercules ufd are discussed in section 4 .",
    "a new estimate of the distance to hercules based on the galaxy s rr lyrae stars is presented in section 5 . finally , the summary and conclusions in section 6 close the paper .",
    "time - series observations in @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the hercules ufd were obtained over the period 2007 april to 2009 june , using a number of different telescopes .",
    "the collected data and related telescopes / instrumental set - ups are summarized in table [ t : obs ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the number of frames in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "pre - reduction of the images was performed by following standard procedures ( bias subtraction and flat - field correction ) with iraf , except for the wfi data , for which the pre - reduction was carried out using the vst - tube pipeline @xcite .",
    "we then performed psf photometry using the daophotiv / allstar / allframe packages ( @xcite ) .",
    "after an accurate evaluation of the psf of each individual frame , a reference image was built by averaging all the available frames and a source catalogue was extracted from the stacked image .",
    "the source list was then passed to allframe , in order to obtain a homogeneous photometry of all images simultaneously , thus providing @xmath42 and @xmath43 instrumental magnitude catalogues for each telescope .",
    "typical internal errors of the single - frame photometry for stars at the hb magnitude level ( @xmath44 mag ) are of about 0.01 mag in both bands .    the absolute photometric calibration was derived using observations of standard stars in the landolt fields sa 101 , sa 107 , sa 110 and pg1323 @xcite , as extended by @xcite , which were obtained at the int during the night of 2007 april 22 .",
    "errors of the absolute photometric calibration are @xmath45 and @xmath46 mag . as the various telescopes we have used define slightly different photometric systems ,",
    "each individual dataset was tied to the int standard calibration independently .",
    "the calibrated catalogues were then combined using daomaster @xcite to create a final list containing positions , robust intensity - weighted mean @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes @xcite , and weighted average values of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 parameters parameter of each star is a robust estimate of the observed pixel - to - pixel scatter of the fitting residuals to the expected scatter , whereas the @xmath48 parameter is related to the intrinsic angular size of the astronomical objects , and for stellar objects should have a value close to zero @xcite . ] for all objects .",
    "we have adopted @xmath49 and @xmath50 to select the stellar - like objects imaged in our total fov of about @xmath10 .",
    "this selection is reliable for magnitudes brighter than @xmath9 24 mag , while the uncertainty increases at fainter magnitudes .",
    "variable stars were identified from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 time - series data , separately .",
    "first , we calculated the fourier transforms ( in the @xcite formulation ) of the stars having at least 12 measurements in each photometric band , then we averaged these transforms to estimate the noise and calculated the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) .",
    "results from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 photometries were cross - correlated , obtaining a list of 860 stars with @xmath51 in both photometric bands ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". a visual inspection of the light curves allowed us to confirm the variability of 10 of these candidates .",
    "we also analyzed in detail all stars falling on the hb , in the region above the hb , where the anomalous cepheids are generally located , and in the blue straggler region , where one may expect to find variables of the sx phoenicis type .",
    "no further variable stars were identified , thus confirming the reliability of our procedure to identify variable stars . to study the light curves we used the software graphical analyzer of time series ( gratis ; see e.g. , @xcite ) that , beyond confirming the variability for all the 10 candidates , also provided periods accurate to 4 - 6 decimal places for all of them .",
    "the hercules variables include 1 anomalous cepheid ( ac ) and 9 rr lyrae stars , of which 6 are fundamental - mode ( rrab ) and 3 are first - overtone ( rrc ) pulsators .",
    "classification and properties of the confirmed variable stars are summarized in table  [ t : rr ] , whereas their light curves are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] and [ f : fig2 ] .",
    "we have assigned to the variables increasing numbers starting from the galaxy center that was set at r.a.@xmath52 , decl.@xmath53 , j2000.0 @xcite .",
    "time - series data for the variable stars are provided in table  [ t : pho ] .",
    "the light curves are very well sampled , and show very little scatter , except for star v10 .",
    "the star does not appear to be blended with other stars on the images .",
    "we suspect that v10 might be affected by the blazhko effect @xcite .",
    "we note that , according to the period , the ac ( star v2 ) could as well be a fundamental - mode rr lyrae star . however , the star s average magnitude is about 0.4 - 0.5 mag brighter than the hb level .",
    "this occurrence , together with a too small amplitude for the star s short period , suggest that the variable either suffers from blending by a contaminant star or is , perhaps , an ac .",
    "the photometric parameters @xmath47 ( goodness of the psf fitting ) and @xmath48 ( estimate of the object shape ) provided for v2 by the allframe package seem to rule out the presence of detectable companions around the star , thus favoring the ac hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that v2 could be an overluminous rrc as , for instance , v70 in the m3 ggc .",
    "however , the period of v2 ( 0.53777 d ) is definitely longer than that of m3-v70 ( @xmath54 d , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the mean magnitude and the period of v2 are in very good agreement with the ac period - luminosity relations by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , thus favoring an ac classification for v2 . finally ,",
    "as described in section [ s : cmd ] , the ac classification is further supported by the comparison with evolutionary tracks .",
    "the ac , all the rrc variables and three of the rrab stars lie inside the half - light radius of the hercules galaxy .",
    "one rrab is just on the border of this region and the remaining two rrab stars lie well outside the half - light radius , with the farthest from the center being confirmed as a member by @xcite on the basis of both radial velocity and strmgren photometry ( see section [ s : cmd ] and figs .",
    "[ f : cmd ] and [ f : ad ] for details ) .",
    "all the rr lyrae stars fall on the hb of the hercules ufd , and their mean magnitude is consistent , within the errors , with the average luminosity of the hb inferred by fitting the galaxy cmd with the ridge line of the ggc m68 ( see section [ s : cmd ] for details ) .",
    "the mean period of the rrab stars is @xmath55 d ( @xmath4=0.03 d ) , thus classifying hercules as an oosterhoff type - ii system .",
    "[ f : bailey ] shows the position of the hercules rr lyrae stars on the @xmath0-band period - amplitude ( bailey ) diagram .",
    "we have also reported the rr lyrae stars identified in the other mw ufds we have studied so far , for comparison .",
    "rrab stars ( star symbols ) lie closer to the loci of the oo  ii systems ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* solid line ) and the rrc stars fall on the long - period tail of the bell - shaped distribution defined by rrc stars in oo  ii systems ( see , e.g. , fig . 9 of @xcite , and fig . 4 of @xcite ) .      as shown by @xcite",
    ", it is possible to use the shape of an rr lyrae @xmath0-band light curve to obtain an estimate of the star s metallicity .",
    "we have performed a fourier decomposition of the @xmath0-band light curves of the variables in hercules and calculated amplitude ratios @xmath56 and phase differences @xmath57 .",
    "we list in table [ t : fou ] these quantities up to the term @xmath58 .",
    "the fourier parameters were then used along with the formulae provided by @xcite and @xcite for ab- and c - type rr lyrae stars , respectively , to obtain individual metallicities for the hercules rr lyrae stars , except for v10 whose light curve is too noisy for a reliable application of the jurcsik & kovacs method .",
    "the metallicity estimates obtained with this technique are reported in column 2 of table  [ t : met ] ; they are on the @xcite scale .",
    "these individual metallicities were transformed to the @xcite metallicity scale ( using the @xcite transformations for the ab - type variables , and the @xcite recalibration for the c - type rr lyrae stars , see column 3 of table [ t : met ] ) .",
    "we then averaged these values ( weighted average ) to obtain our best estimate for the metallicity of hercules old population .",
    "our resultant metallicity is @xmath25_{rr , c09 } } \\rangle= -2.30 \\pm 0.15 $ ] dex .",
    "literature values for the hercules ufd s metal abundance are summarized in table [ t : lit_met ] .",
    "they were obtained using a variety of different methods and span a rather large range .",
    "in particular , we note that the values from @xcite and @xcite are photometric estimates based on fitting the galaxy s cmd with evolutionary tracks , while all other entries in the table are spectroscopic determinations .",
    "specifically , the @xcite value is based on abundance analysis of medium - high resolution ( @xmath59 ) spectra of two stars in hercules .",
    "the @xcite analysis is based on medium - resolution spectra of 30 red giants in hercules , and the measurement of the equivalent widths of the ca triplet absorption lines .",
    "the @xcite study is a re - analysis of the @xcite spectroscopic data , based on an automated spectral synthesis technique .",
    "this latter method likely provides systematically lower metallicities ( by @xmath60 dex ) , as discussed by the authors themselves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , in a recent study , @xcite confirm that a large metallicity spread ( @xmath61}\\leq -2.0 $ ] dex , for an average value of [ fe / h]=@xmath62 dex ) exists in hercules , from the analysis of medium - high resolution ( @xmath63 ) spectra of 11 rgb stars .",
    "however , taking into account only the red giants with metallicity measurements based on a significant number of iron lines ( @xmath64 ; four stars according to table  6 in @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath65}\\rangle=-2.3 \\pm 0.2 $ ] dex ( and a range of ( @xmath66}\\leq -2.0 $ ] dex ) .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with our estimate from the rr lyrae stars . on this basis",
    ", we will adopt the metallicity estimate @xmath67_{rr , c09 } \\rangle$ ] obtained from the rr lyrae stars in the following analysis .",
    "hercules reddening can be estimated from the galaxy s rr lyrae stars .",
    "using the relation for rrab stars by @xcite , that connects the color excess to the star s b - band amplitude , the logarithm of the period and the metallicity , we obtain a mean color excess @xmath68 mag , where we have adopted the individual metallicities on the @xcite scale listed in table  [ t : met ] .",
    "we also use the method by @xcite , which is based on the rr lyrae s @xmath69 color at minimum light , and obtain @xmath70 mag , by applying the metallicity - dependent relation by @xcite .",
    "this estimate is larger than the previous value but , as already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , sturch s method overestimates the color excess by 0.01 - 0.03 mag .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath71 mag for the reddening .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the value of @xmath72 mag derived from the @xcite maps .",
    "[ f : cmd ] shows the @xmath0 , @xmath69 cmd of hercules obtained in the present study . in the left panel",
    "we plot stellar - like objects within the galaxy s half - light radius ; in the right panel , instead , we show objects outside this region over our fov of @xmath10 .",
    "all the rr lyrae stars have been plotted in the left panel of the figure including those falling outside the galaxy half - light radius .",
    "the cmd reaches @xmath73 25 mag and appears to be heavily contaminated at each magnitude level by field objects belonging to the mw halo and disk , as well as by background galaxies .",
    "our photometry reaches a few magnitudes deeper than the sdss photometry ( see fig . 2 of @xcite )",
    "; while it is roughly 1 mag shallower than the photometry obtained using the lbt ( fig . 1 in @xcite , and fig . 8 in @xcite )",
    "however , within the errors , it is consistent both in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , with the photometry reported in table 2 of @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f : cmd ] , the main branches of the hercules cmd are barely distinguishable due to the overwhelming contamination by the mw field . to identify stars belonging to hercules we used the method that we have already successfully applied in our previous papers ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we used the mean ridgelines of the ggc m68 ( dashed black lines in figure [ f : cmd ] ) , obtained from @xcite @xmath74 photometry to fit the hb and rgb of the hercules ufd , by letting the m68 ridgelines vary within the values of the cluster reddening and distance modulus available in the literature",
    ". the `` by eye '' best fit was obtained for a shift of @xmath75 mag in magnitude and @xmath76 mag in color .",
    "we adopted m68 for identifying members of the hercules ufd because , like hercules , it is very metal - poor .",

    "furthermore , the cluster has a well - defined and tight rgb , as well as an extended hb including stars both redder and bluer than the rr lyrae instability strip ( @xcite ) , thus resulting better suited to identify the galaxy s hb than , for instance , m92 , which instead was used as a fiducial by @xcite . with this procedure we selected as most probable members of the hercules galaxy the sources lying within @xmath78 mag in @xmath69 from the ridgelines of m68 ( black dots in the left panel of figure [ f : cmd ] ) .",
    "to account for the larger photometric errors , below @xmath79 mag we extended this range within @xmath80 mag of the ridgeline of m68 ( blue dots ) adopting for m68 a reddening value of @xmath81 mag @xcite the color shifts needed to match the hb and rgb of hercules imply a reddening of @xmath82 mag for the galaxy , in excellent agreement with the value obtained from the rrab stars ( see section [ s : met ] ) .",
    "totally similar results are obtained using the ridgelines of the ggc m15 that is slightly more metal - poor than m68 and matches equally well the main branches of the hercules cmd , whereas the ridgeline of the metal - intermediate gc m3 ( ngc  5272 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is too red and would require a negative reddening to match the galaxy rgb .    with the help of m68 ridgelines , it is possible to determine the average luminosity of the hercules hb in the region of the so - called rr lyrae gap ( @xmath83 mag ) , and to locate the galaxy s main - sequence turnoff at @xmath84 mag .",

    "the most deviating ( brightest ) of the rr lyrae variables , star v9 , is located well outside the galaxy s half - light radius ( see figs . [",
    "f : ad ] and [ f : adzoom ] ) .",
    "thus , its high luminosity could be caused by a projection effect .",
    "the average magnitude of the rr lyrae stars lying inside the galaxy s half - light radius is @xmath94 mag ( average on 7 stars ) , where the error is the standard deviation of the mean . to obtain the absolute visual magnitude of hercules hb stars , we adopt for the slope of the rr lyrae magnitude - metallicity calibration the value @xmath95 } = 0.214 ( \\pm 0.047)$ ] mag dex@xmath33 @xcite , and consider two different calibrations of the zero point . at [ fe / h]=@xmath96 dex",
    ", we adopt : @xmath97 mag , that is based on the large magellanic cloud distance modulus of 18.52 @xmath98 mag of @xcite , and , alternatively , @xmath99 mag , from @xcite . adopting for metallicity and reddening the values derived in section [ s : met ] ( @xmath100_{rr , c09}\\rangle}= -2.30 \\pm 0.15 $ ] dex , and @xmath101 mag , respectively ) we obtain true distance moduli of @xmath102}=20.6\\pm 0.1 $ ] mag ( @xmath103}=132 \\pm 6 $ ] kpc ) , and @xmath104}=20.7 \\pm 0.1 $ ] mag ( @xmath105}=138 \\pm 6 $ ] kpc ) , for the @xcite and @xcite calibrations , respectively .",
    "the errors on the distance values include the contribution of the uncertainties on the metallicity , the reddening , the adopted slope of the @xmath106}$ ] relation , and the average apparent visual magnitude of the hercules rr lyrae stars .",
    "an additional estimate of the distance , based on the rr lyrae stars , can be obtained using the theoretical wesenheit relation in the @xmath38 bands , as defined by @xcite , with the assumption of a suitable evolutionary mass for the metallicity of hercules rr lyrae stars .",
    "the resulting distance modulus of @xmath107 mag is in perfect agreement with @xmath102}$ ] .",
    "moreover , a distance of @xmath108 kpc is in excellent agreement with the estimates by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in statistical agreement with the distance by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the distance @xmath105}$ ] appears to be only in statistical agreement with all previous determinations . to conclude this discussion",
    ", we note that the very long estimate of @xmath109 kpc , obtained by @xcite is likely due to their hb mean magnitude being based on a few stars , of which some are variables observed at random phase , as we have confirmed in our study .",
    "finally , the apparent distance modulus adopted in fig .",
    "[ f : cmd_tracce ] , @xmath110 mag , corresponds to a true distance modulus of 20.7 mag .",
    "however , we should take into account the theoretical uncertainties on the luminosity of the zahb and , in particular , the remark by @xcite that , adopting updated conductive opacities , might cause an increase in the @xmath111 of about 0.06 mag at the metallicity of hercules , and a corresponding decrease in the inferred distance modulus . on this basis , and considering also the results of the theoretical wesenheit relation , we thus conclude that our most reliable estimate for the distance modulus of hercules is : @xmath112 mag .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first time - series analysis of the hercules ufd . using a variety of telescope / instrument facilities we secured @xmath113 80 and 50 epochs in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "these data allowed us to detect and characterize 9 rr lyrae stars ( 6 ab- and 3 c - type , respectively ) and one anomalous cepheid .",
    "the same observations allowed us to build a deep cmd extending well beyond the galaxy s half - light radius .",
    "the main results of this study are listed below :    * the average period of the ab - type rr lyrae stars , @xmath2p@xmath1140.68 d , qualifies hercules as an oosterhoff ii system , in good agreement with the vast majority of the ufds investigated so far .",
    "this occurrence favors the hypothesis that the ufds could be the `` building blocks '' of the galactic halo , since the pulsation characteristics of their rr lyrae stars are in agreement with the properties of the mw halo variables .",
    "* hercules cmd is dominated by a stellar population at least as old and metal - poor as the ggc m68 .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous findings .",
    "the hb shows some spread .",
    "we also detected an overabundance of stars above the hb , thus confirming the previous finding by @xcite .",
    "this , along with the detection of an anomalous cepheid very likely belonging to hercules , hints at the possible presence of an intermediate - age population about @xmath93 gyrs old in hercules . *",
    "the spatial distribution of hercules stars confirms the elongated shape of this galaxy .",
    "the signature that hercules is undergoing tidal disruption is provided by the absence of a clearcut difference between galaxy and field star properties , and by the presence of two rr lyrae stars lying well beyond the galaxy s half - light radius . *",
    "the rr lyrae variables were used to obtain independent estimates of the metallicity , reddening and distance to hercules , for which we find [ fe / h]=@xmath115 dex , @xmath6 mag , and @xmath116 mag respectively , in very good agreement with literature values .",
