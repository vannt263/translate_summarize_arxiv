    "the system created in non central relativistic nucleus - nucleus collision possesses large angular orbital momentum . some of the most interesting and important phenomena predicted to occur in such a system are the strong parity violation @xcite and the global system polarization @xcite .",
    "strong @xmath2 and @xmath3 violation should be revealed via preferential emission of the same charge particles in the direction along the system angular momentum .",
    "this effect is already known for a few years @xcite-@xcite but only recently clear theoretical estimates and experimental observables were suggested @xcite .",
    "the effect of the global system polarization was first discussed in @xcite where theoretical arguments for the globally polarized system produced in non central nucleus - nucleus collision were presented and possible observable consequences and theoretical estimates were given .",
    "the global polarization originates from transformation of the orbital angular momentum of the system into the particle s spin .",
    "the latter leads to the polarization of secondary produced particles along the system orbital momentum .",
    "the effects of the parity violation and the global system polarization are both defined by the presence of the large angular momentum in the colliding system . since the angular momentum of the system is perpendicular to the collision reaction plane the effects under consideration can be studied by methods and techniques developed for anisotropic flow analysis . in this paper the parity violation effects are studied by three particle azimuthal correlations of charged particles .",
    "this technique is based on the mixed harmonic method @xcite .",
    "the global polarization of the system is examined by measuring the polarization of strange hyperons with respect to the collision reaction plane .",
    "the hyperon polarization can be assessed via anisotropy in angular distribution of decay products in the hyperon s rest frame measured with respect to the collision reaction plane .",
    "this measurement is similar to the standard method of extracting directed flow @xcite .",
    "particles produced in the system with large angular orbital momentum are predicted to be polarized along the collision reaction plane direction due to spin - orbital coupling @xcite .",
    "such polarization can be defined from the angular distribution of hyperon decay products with respect to the collision reaction plane : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hyperon polarization with respect to the collision reaction plane , @xmath6 is the hyperon decay constant ( @xmath7 for @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 is the angle between the normal for the collision reaction plane and the nucleon 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame .",
    "global polarization @xmath10 can be defined from two particle azimuthal correlations with respect to the collision reaction plane : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the azimuthal angle of hyperon s decay product 3-momentum in the hyperon s rest frame , and @xmath13 is the collision reaction plane angle .",
    "fig.[lambdapolarization ] shows @xmath14 polarization as a function of @xmath14 pseudo - rapidity . in this calculation",
    "the reaction plane is obtained from directed flow of charged particles in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath15 from star forward time projection chamber ( ftpc ) and from fragmentation neutrons with @xmath16 from star zero degree calorimeter - shower maximum detector ( zdc - smd ) .",
    "points in fig.[lambdapolarization ] represent the star preliminary results from the experimental data for au+au collisions at @xmath17 gev .",
    "constant line fit to the data gives the upper limit for @xmath14 polarization : @xmath18 .",
    "the obtained results in the errors range are consistent with zero .",
    "the theoretical prediction @xcite for the @xmath14 polarization is @xmath19 with the magnitude far larger than that observed in the current measurement .",

    "parity violation , discussed in @xcite , implies asymmetry in the particle emission along the system orbital momentum .",
    "such asymmetry fluctuates event by event but it relative sign for the opposite charge particles stays constant .",
    "this results in the following azimuthal distribution @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath12 is the particle emission azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane , @xmath23 is the asymmetry is related to the asymmetry @xmath24 defined in @xcite via : @xmath25 in charged particle production , defined by the ratio of topological charge @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) to the corresponding charged particle multiplicity @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one can measure charged particle anisotropy ( [ paritydistribution ] ) by using mixed harmonic method @xcite applied in a symmetric pseudo - rapidity region : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the azimuthal angle of particles / antiparticles ( for example @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , and @xmath13 is the collision reaction plane angle .",
