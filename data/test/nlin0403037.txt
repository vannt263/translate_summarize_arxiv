    "optical dispersive and diffractive media with quadratic [ @xmath3 nonlinearity are well known for their potential to support various types of solitons , which have been a subject of intensive studies @xcite . in most cases , @xmath1 solitons",
    "are experimentally observed in the spatial domain , as the small size of available samples makes it difficult to accommodate the dispersion length of temporal solitons . nevertheless , using special techniques , such as tilted wave fronts , it is possible to induce a strong artificial dispersion and thus create temporal solitons in available @xmath1 optical crystals @xcite .",
    "another challenge for the experiment was creation of @xmath1 dark solitons ( dss ) and their two - dimensional counterparts ( optical vortices ) .",
    "for the first time , dss in @xmath1 models were considered in the cascading limit , which corresponds to a large phase mismatch between the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and second - harmonic ( sh ) waves @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the @xmath1 model reduces to the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the kerr [ @xmath4 nonlinearity . beyond the cascading limit , a single analytical solution @xcite , and a continuous family of numerical solutions for fundamental and twin - hole dss @xcite were found .",
    "all these solitons are unstable in the spatial domain , due to the modulational instability ( mi ) of the cw ( continuous - wave ) plane - wave background which supports the ds .",
    "the only possibility to avoid the mi was found in the temporal domain , in the case when the group - velocity - dispersion coefficients have opposite signs at the ff and sh @xcite ( in fact , such a case is quite realistic in the temporal domain @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , effectively stable spatial - domain vortices , supported by a background of finite extension , were experimentally created in the case of negative phase mismatch between the ff and sh waves @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the mi had the character of a convective instability , so that perturbations were carried away from the vortex s core faster than they grew due to the mi .",
    "additional possibilities for creation of solitons are offered by a combination of @xmath1 nonlinearity with bragg gratings ( bgs ) .",
    "the grating may be introduced in both the time - domain and spatial - domain models , but in the latter one it is a more realistic feature , amounting to a system of parallel scratches  drawn on the surface of a quadratically nonlinear planar waveguide . in that case , the generic @xmath1 model is a four - wave one , as both the ff and sh components include two counter - propagating waves ( detailed descriptions of the model can be found in the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the mi of cw solutions was studied in the four - wave model , with a conclusion that they are unstable in most cases .",
    "stability regions for the cw states were also found , close to the transition to the nls limit , but only in a rather exotic case when the bg strength at the sh is larger than at the ff @xcite .",
    "a stable dark bi - soliton in this model was found numerically near the band edge @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the mi of cw states , and , in the case when they are stable , to find dss in a _ three - wave _  spatial - domain system , in which two ff components are linearly coupled through the resonant scattering on the bg .",
    "simultaneously , the quadratic nonlinearity couples the two ff components to the sh wave . the propagation direction @xmath5 is parallel to the scratches \" which form the bg",
    ". then , the above - mentioned couplings can be achieved by choosing ff carrier wave vectors to be of equal magnitude and making opposite angles with the @xmath5 axis , while the sh wave vector is parallel to it .",
    "thus , only the ff components are affected by the grating , while the sh wave is subject to diffraction .",

    "stable gap solitons , as well as bright _ embedded solitons _ ( which exist inside the continuous part of the system s linear spectrum @xcite ) have been found in this three - wave model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the model is formulated in section [ sec : model ] , where we also give an estimate for relevant values of the physical parameters . in section [ mi ] , we identify two types of cw solutions and analyze their modulational stability .",
    "it is shown that , on the contrary to other @xmath1 models in the spatial domain , in the present case one type of the cw solutions is _ stable _ in a broad range of parameters .",
    "dss supported by the stable cw background are considered in section [ dark ] . for stationary fundamental solitons ,",
    "we find an approximate analytical and direct numerical solutions .",

    "then , the physical value of the wavenumber detuning corresponding to @xmath37 , i.e. , just above the upper edge of the spectral gap , which is shown below to be appropriate for dss , is about @xmath38 @xmath36 .",
