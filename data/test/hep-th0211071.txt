    "in this paper we will discuss the long distance classical and quantum corrections to the schwarszchild and kerr metrics using the techniques of effective field theory .",
    "we will show how the nonanalytic radiative corrections to the energy - momentum tensor can be used to obtain the classical nonlinear terms in these metrics at long distance , and calculate the analogous nonanalytic quantum corrections .",
    "for the schwarzschild metric we consider the case of a massive scalar particle . here",
    "we clear up some numerical disagreements in related calculations that have emerged in the literature .",
    "we then present the kerr results , using a massive fermion as a source , and show that the spin - independent quantum corrections are the same as those of the scalar particle .",
    "we also elucidate various theoretical issues and compare with other results in the literature .",
    "effective field theory is ideally suited for discussing the quantum effects of general relativity at scales well below the planck mass@xcite . while it is expected that the degrees of freedom and the interactions of gravity will be modified beyond the planck scale , at low energies these ingredients are accurately described by general relativity .",
    "effective field theory separates the known quantum effects of the low energy particles from the unknown physics at high energy .",
    "the latter effects are represented by the most general series of effective lagrangians consistent with the symmetry of general relativity .",
    "however the propagation of the low energy particles yields identifiable quantum effects that can be isolated by the techniques of effective field theory .",
    "the present study builds on two sets of recent work .",
    "one of these is the use of effective field theory to study quantum corrections to the gravitational potential@xcite .",
    "while the basic principles of these studies are the same , there are some differences and/or disagreements .",
    "since there is not a universal definition of the meaning of a potential , different authors use different definitions of potential in terms of feynman diagrams , and hence obtain different answers . even in a case where the same definition is used",
    ", different results have been obtained .",
    "we will provide some clarification of these disagreements .",
    "a related paper @xcite provides a full and detailed calculation of the scattering potential of scalar particles . in the present paper",
    "we note that a subset of diagrams is more readily interpreted as a change in the metric , and we calculate these effects .    the other precedent for the present paper is the calculation of the the leading quantum corrections to the reissner - nordstrom and kerr - newman metrics using effective field theory@xcite .",
    "these metrics involve charged particles , so that the quantum corrections involved photon loops , not graviton loops . however , this provided a particularly clear laboratory for the study of metric corrections .",
    "interestingly , we saw that the _ classical _ nonlinearities in the metric can be calculated straightforwardly using feynman diagram techniques .",
    "at the same time we saw that there was a clear identification of certain nonanalytic terms with long - distance quantum effects in the metric .",
    "we use the insights of that study to investigate the present problems , which involve graviton loops . in the present case",
    "the interpretation is not as clear , although the calculations are well defined .",
    "we will be using harmonic gauge throughout this paper . in this gauge",
    ", the schwarzschild metric has the form@xcite , @xmath3 the kerr metric@xcite refers to a particle with spin and , keeping only terms up to first order in the angular momentum , has the harmonic gauge form @xmath4 we will show that using a particular set of feynman diagrams we reproduce the former with the addition of a long distance quantum correction @xmath5 for the kerr metric , @xmath6 it is of course required that the classical spin - independent terms must be the same for a scalar particle and a fermion .",
    "we know of no firm requirement for the spin - independence of the quantum corrections to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but from our calculation they are seen to be identical .",
    "the metric is derived from the energy - momentum tensor of a source , using einstein s equation as the equation of motion . at lowest order in the fields ,",
    "the source particle is just a point particle in coordinate space .",
    "however , both classical fields and their quantum fluctuations modify the energy - momentum of a particle at long distance .",
    "these modifications can be found by the consideration of the radiative corrections to the energy - momentum tensor . when these are translated into a metric , they yield the classical nonlinearities and quantum modifications of the metric .",
    "let us review what was found in ref@xcite for the conceptually simpler case of charged particles , as our calculation here will follow the same procedure . in that case",
    "the field around the particles was the electromagnetic field and the gravitational interaction was treated purely classically .",
    "the masslessness of the photon implies that there are long range fields around a charged particle and these carry energy and momentum . at the same time , in a feynman diagram calculation of the renormalization of the energy momentum tensor of the charged particle , the masslessness of the photon leads to nonanalytic terms in the formfactors having the structure @xmath0 , where @xmath9 is the momentum transfer , as well as analytic terms of order @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown in detail how the @xmath11 terms account for the classical energy - momentum of the electromagnetic field and how they exactly reproduce the classical nonlinearities in the metric that are present in the reissner nordstrom and kerr newman metrics .",
    "nonanalytic terms of the form @xmath12 also appear , and when they are included in the equations of motion they produce further corrections in these metrics .",
    "explicit examination shows that these latter are linear in @xmath13 - i.e.they are quantum effects .",
    "finally the analytic terms produce only delta functions ( or derivatives of delta functions ) in the metric , such that they vanish at long distance .",
    "thus we saw that the long distance modifications of the metrics are obtained from the nonanlaytic terms in the formfactors of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the same effects are present in the purely gravitational case .",
    "if one expands the energy and momentum of the particle in powers of g , the lowest order result is that of a point particle .",
    "however , there is energy and momentum also carried by the gravitational field around the particle and this can be calculated via the one loop feynman diagrams . because the graviton is massless , there will also be nonanalytic terms of the forms @xmath0 in the formfactors of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "again these will produce long range modifications of the metric .",
    "if we include the relevant dimensionful couplings , this will have the schematic form @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\     & \\sim & gm \\left [ { 1\\over r } + { a g m\\over   r^2 } + { b g   \\hbar\\over     r^3 }     + { c g } \\delta^3(x ) + \\ldots \\right ]     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath15 are dimensionless numbers and further numerical factors of order unity will be inserted later .",
    "we will examine the @xmath16 terms in detail and show how they correctly reproduce all the features of the classical metric .",
    "for the @xmath12 terms we have included the factor of @xmath13 that follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "the analytic correction to the energy momentum tensor yields the delta function term that is not relevant for the long distance behavior .",
    "the nonanalytic terms come from the low energy propagation of gravitons , using the couplings of general relativity . because these features are independent of the high energy behavior of gravity , they are unambiguous predictions of low energy general relativity .",
    "there is also no influence of other possible terms in the gravitational lagrangian , such as @xmath17 or related corrections in the matter lagrangian .",
    "these yield only analytic corrections to the formfactor and hence do not provide long distance modifications of the metric .",
    "these are behaviors that are well known in the effective field theory of gravity@xcite .",

    "we now proceed to the inclusion of loop corrections .",
    "of course , the lowest order discussion given above is straightforward and familiar , while the purpose of the present paper is determine the nonanalytic corrections @xmath44 to the form factors arising from the higher order gravitational self - interaction .",
    "the appearance of such terms was found in i to be associated with the feature that the graviton couples to the ( massless ) photon , and the same is expected to happen in the case of gravitational self - interaction since the graviton is itself massless .",

    "such higher order corrections are to be expected from the feature that gravity is nonlinear and must contain terms to all orders in the gravitational coupling .",

    "this can be seen by defining @xmath78 whereby @xmath79 _ i.e. _ , @xmath77 , as found explicitly in our calculation .",
    "the feynman diagrams for fermions are shown in fig 2 .",

    "the diagonal components of the vacuum polarization are also clearly identical to the bosonic case , but there is a new off - diagonal component associated with the spin @xmath87 again these are added together in order to yield the result quoted in the introduction .",
    "we have thus reproduced the kerr metric  eq .",
    "[ eq : ker]in harmonic gauge together with the associated quantum corrections .",
    "the quantum correction to the schwarzschild metric has previously been discussed by duff@xcite .",
    "while that discussion properly identifies @xmath88 terms as the source of the quantum effects , the calculation is incomplete because it only includes the effect of the vacuum polarization diagram .",
    "this can be traced to the assumption of a `` classical source '' , which meant that the vertex diagrams were not included .",
    "however , any source has a gravitational field surrounding it and that field has a quantum component .",
    "the effective field theory treatment demonstrates the existence of quantum corrections due to the vertex diagrams - they are of the same order as those due to vacuum polarization and they must be included . in this sense , there is no fully classical source in gravity .",
    "if one takes the mass of a particle to infinity , the gravitational coupling also grows and the quantum effects do not decouple . rather for a heavy mass it is long distances which determines the classical limit , as the quantum effects become smaller than the classical effects in the limit of large distance .",
    "however , the vertex corrections are as important as the vacuum polarization for the quantum correction to the metric and they must be included .",
    "the bosonic diagrams that we have considered have also been parts of the calculations of the quantum corrections to the newtonian potential .",
    "we have shown them in detail because there has been numerical disagreements in the literature .",
    "we believe that our results are the correct ones .",

    "[ eq : bbid ] makes it easy to repeat this part of the calculation .",
    "the authors of ref @xcite also appear to be in error .",
    "their calculation would lead to the wrong classical terms , which certainly indicates an error and implies that the quoted quantum portion is also not trustworthy .",
    "in addition , our fermionic calculation serves as an independent confirmation of the bosonic result , as the calculational details are quite different even though the result is the same .",
    "if we use our present result to define the one - particle - reducible potential , including the diagrams in figure 3 , we obtain the result , @xmath89 this potential is not itself the scattering potential . in a separate work",
    "@xcite we calculate the other diagrams which are required to fully define the scattering amplitude . these include box diagrams and several triangle diagrams .",
    "however , the 1pr potential represents the sets of diagrams that are used to define the running charge in qed and qcd and these diagrams can be used for a similar definition here .",
    "we propose that the quantum correction from these diagrams be used to define a running gravitational coupling appropriate for harmonic gauge .",
    "this results in @xmath90 the fact that this definition is independent of the masses of the objects involved suggests that it has a universal character appropriate for the running charge .",
    "our work shows that this form is independent of spin .",
    "note also that the charge becomes weaker at shorter distances .",
    "this is in accord with a heuristic expectation that the gravitational interaction at large distances feels the total mass of the object , but when probed at small distances gravity will see a smaller effect because the quantum fluctuations spread out the energy contained in the fields . that the running gravitational coupling varies with a power of @xmath52 rather than the logarithm",
