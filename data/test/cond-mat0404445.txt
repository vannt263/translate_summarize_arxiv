    "a strongly damped spin descends almost straightly , whereas a weakly damped spin executes several rotations ( @xmath152 ) about the anisotropy axis .",
    "this allows the weakly damped spin to pass close to the saddle area , where it will have additional opportunities , not available for the damped spin , to cross the barrier , enhancing its relaxation rate .",

    "this agreement , in turn , supports the interpretation discussed above of the damping dependence .",
    "the reason is that our analytical expression includes at its heart the formula for @xmath2 in a weak transverse field @xcite , which accounts for the effects of the corresponding saddle point on the relaxation rate .",

    "@xcite , it has been shown that effects apparently different as the damping dependence of @xmath2 in transverse fields , the damping sensitivity of the _ nonlinear _",
    "susceptibility @xcite , and the effects of the damping on the _ linear _ response of dipole - dipole coupled systems @xcite , have a common origin , which is the strong sensitivity of the relaxation rate to the damping in transverse fields .",

    "this would by - pass its determination from the pre - exponential factor @xmath160 in the relaxation time ( @xmath161 ) , which usually only gives an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "besides , one does not need high frequencies to explore the effects of @xmath3 , in contrast to magnetic resonance experiments ( avoiding the associated technical difficulties ) . clearly , the availability of a simple analytical expression to model the @xmath151 data should be of great assistance to determine @xmath3 .",
    "coffey _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that a method based on the _ linear _ susceptibility with superimposed bias fields would made the resort to the nonlinear response unnecessary .",
    "however , in their case the fittings should be done to a formula involving more complicated expressions , both for the equilibrium parts ( numerically obtained ) and the relaxation times ( involving the different kramers regimes ) .",
