    "there are a number of reasons to think that cosmic ray particles might be particularly abundant within the intracluster medium .",
    "first , clusters of galaxies should be very effective traps for cosmic ray ions and electrons . under reasonable assumptions for the diffusion coefficient ,",
    "particles with energies of less than @xmath2@xmath3 gev have diffusion times which are longer than the hubble time ( colafrancesco & blasi 1999 ) .",
    "second , the lifetimes of cosmic ray particles , even the electrons which are responsible for most of the radiative signatures of relativistic particles , can be quite long . the radiation fields ( optical / ir and x - ray ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath4 g ) in the icm are low enough that high energy electrons mainly lose energy by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "lower energy electrons can lose energy by coulomb interactions with the plasma ; however , at the very low densities ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) in the bulk of the icm , this is only important for electrons with @xmath7 .",
    "( here , @xmath8 is the lorentz factor for the electrons , so that their total energy is @xmath9 . ) for electrons with @xmath10 , the lifetime is set by ic losses and is @xmath11 the lifetimes of ions are set by interactions ; for protons , this gives @xmath12 yr .",
    "thus , clusters of galaxies can retain low energy electrons ( @xmath13 ) and nearly all cosmic ray ions for a significant fraction of a hubble time .",
    "cluster of galaxies are likely to have substantial sources of cosmic rays",
    ". clusters often contain powerful radio galaxies , which may produce and distribute cosmic rays throughout the cluster , in addition to possible contributions from the cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the primary reason why the cosmic ray populations in clusters might be large is connected with the high temperature of the intracluster gas .",
    "this indicates that all of the intracluster medium ( typically , @xmath14 of gas ) has passed through strong shocks with shock velocities of @xmath151000 km / s during its history . in our own galaxy ,",
    "whenever diffuse gas undergoes a strong shock at velocities of this order , a portion of the shock energy goes into the acceleration of relativistic particles ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) thus , it seems likely that relatively efficient particle acceleration also occurs in clusters of galaxies .    direct evidence for the presence of an extensive population of relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the icm comes from the observation of diffuse synchrotron radio halos in clusters ( e.g. , giovannini et al .",
    "more recently , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and very soft x - ray emission has been detected from a number of clusters ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a , b ; mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ) .",
    "one hypothesis is that this radiation is inverse compton ( ic ) emission by relativistic electrons ( hwang 1997 ; enlin & biermann 1998 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "finally , hard x - ray emission has recently been detected in clusters with @xmath16 , which might be due to ic emission from higher energy electrons ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; kaastra , bleeker , & mewe 1998 ) .",
    "the euv emission would require electrons with @xmath13 , while the hard x - ray emission would require @xmath17 .    in this paper ,",
    "illustrative models will be presented for the integrated energy spectrum of primary , relativistic electrons , under the assumption that they remain trapped in the cluster ( colafrancesco & blasi 1999 ) .",
    "more details on these models are given in sarazin ( 1999 ) .",
    "radio synchrotron and inverse compton emission spectra will be determined up to the hard x - ray spectral band .",
    "gamma - ray emission by the same electrons ( as well as emission by ions through @xmath18 decay ) will also be discussed briefly .",
    "i will use the lorentz factor @xmath8 of the electrons as the independent variable rather than the kinetic energy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron mass . let @xmath21 be the total number of electrons in the cluster with energies in the range @xmath8 to @xmath22 , and",
    "let @xmath23 be the total rate of production of new cosmic ray this energy range .",
    "the equation for the electron spectrum is then @xmath24 + q ( \\gamma ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 gives the energy loss by an individual electron .",
    "the loss function includes ic emission , coulomb losses , synchrotron losses , and bremsstrahlung losses . in fig.[fig : losses ] , these loss rates are shown as a function of @xmath8 for typical cluster conditions .",
    "ic losses dominate at high energies @xmath10 , while coulomb losses dominate at low energies .",
    "values for the loss time scale , defined as @xmath26 , are shown in fig.[fig : lifetime ] .",
    "the lifetime are maximum at @xmath27 , where they are @xmath28 gyr , which is comparable to the likely ages of clusters .",
    "the nature of the resulting electron populations depends on whether there is a current or very recent ( @xmath29 ) source of particles in the clusters , such as an ongoing merger shock , or the electrons were all accelerated in the past ( @xmath30 ) . in all of the models shown here ,",
    "the accelerated electrons have a power - law spectrum , @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and the electron spectra are normalized such that the total kinetic energy injected in electrons with @xmath33 is @xmath34 ergs .",
    "fig.[fig : model_init ] shows the present - day electron spectra in a series of models without any current source of newly accelerated particles .",
    "thus , these models might apply to a cluster which is not currently undergoing a subcluster merger . at low energies ,",
    "the electron population is reduced and the shape flattened by coulomb losses . at high energies , the electron population is reduced and the shape of the spectrum steepened by ic and synchrotron losses . because the ic and synchrotron losses increase with the square of the electron energy , there is an upper cut - off to the electron distribution ; no electrons are found at energies higher than @xmath35 .",
    "because the energy density in the cmb increases as @xmath36 , the ic losses increase rapidly at high redshift .",
    "if there is no electron acceleration since @xmath37 , the value of @xmath38 , and coulomb losses remove all of the lower energy electrons . in order to have any significant population of primary electrons with @xmath39 at the present time",
    ", there must have been a substantial injection of particles into clusters at moderately low redshifts , @xmath40 .",
    "fig.[fig : model_steady ] shows the resulting present - day electron spectra in models in which there is a current source of accelerated electrons , such as a cluster merger shock .",
    "again , coulomb losses reduce and flatten the electron population at low energies , and ic and synchrotron losses reduce and steepen the electron population at high energies .",
    "however , these losses do nt remove the high energy particles completely , as new particles are always being accelerated .",
    "instead , the population quickly relaxes into steady - state , where the low ( high ) energy population is one power flatter ( steeper ) than the injected electrons ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) .    finally , we consider models in which there is an initial population in the cluster , and in which there also is current injection of new particles .",
    "these might apply to the more realistic cases where the cluster had particle acceleration associated with the formation of the cluster and mergers in the past , but also has a subcluster merger occurring at present .",
    "an illustrative set of such models are shown in fig.[fig : model_both ] .",
    "the different models are characterized by differing values of @xmath41 , which is the fraction of the particle energy which has been injected by the current steady injection process , as opposed to the earlier population .",
    "if the electrons were injected in cluster shocks , then @xmath41 might be roughly proportional to the fraction of the thermal energy content of the icm which is being generated in the current shock .",
    "the general features of these models are that the electron spectrum is moderately flat below @xmath27 . unless there is a very strong present merger or other current particle source , the electron population drops off rapidly above @xmath27 . in most models for clusters",
    ", most of the relativistic electron energy should be in particles with @xmath27 ; these are the particles with the longest lifetimes ( fig.[fig : lifetime ] ) .",
    "if a cluster has a ongoing merger or other particle source , then there will also be a high energy tail to the particle distribution . because this tail is likely to be in steady - state , the electron distribution is likely to be one power steeper than the source , perhaps @xmath42 .",
    "the emission produced by the relativistic electron populations through the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons was also calculated .",
    "let @xmath43 be the luminosity of ic emission at frequencies from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "then , the spectrum of ic emission is related to the electron spectrum @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 . here",
    ", @xmath49 is the mean intensity at a frequency @xmath44 of the radiation field being scattered . for the cmb ,",
    "this is just the black body function @xmath50 . for a power - law electron spectrum @xmath51 ,",
    "the ic spectrum is a power - law @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath54 for the injection spectrum of @xmath32 .",
    "fig.[fig : ic ] shows the resulting ic spectra for a variety of different models ; for details of the specific models , see sarazin ( 1999 ) .",
    "model 1 has a current source of electrons ; for example , this might be due to a subcluster merger . at frequencies above @xmath55 hz",
    ", the spectrum quickly steepens with time due to ic losses , and becomes a half power steeper than that given by the injected electron spectrum , @xmath56 . at low frequencies",
    ", the spectrum flattens more gradually due to coulomb losses , approaching a spectrum which is a half power flatter than that due to the injected spectrum , @xmath57 . if the current acceleration process has occurred since a redshift of @xmath58 , the spectrum is near that of a steady - state electron population , with these two power - laws meeting at a knee at @xmath59 hz .",
    "if the current acceleration process is more recent , there is a central region of the ic spectrum where the electrons are not yet in steady - state . here , the spectral index is @xmath60 .",
    "models 11 and 22 have no current source of electrons ( e.g. , no ongoing cluster merger ) .",
    "the electron energy distributions of these models have a cut off at high energies , @xmath35 , which results from rapid ic and synchrotron losses by high energy electrons ( see fig.[fig : model_init ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the ic spectra have a very rapid fall off at high energies ( exponentially or slightly faster ; see eq .",
    "[ 54 ] in sarazin [ 1999 ] ) .    at low frequencies ,",
    "the ic spectra of models without current acceleration flatten and become slowly increasing with frequency as the models age .",
    "we expect that the low energy electron spectrum in an older model without current acceleration will become nearly independent of @xmath8 except for a slowly varying logarithmic factor ( see eq .  36 in sarazin [ 1999 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath61 constant at low energies , then the low frequency ic spectrum varies as @xmath62 .",
    "model 27 in fig.[fig : ic ] shows the spectrum of a model with both an initial population of particles and electron acceleration at the present time . in this model ,",
    "the fraction of electron being contributed by the current acceleration ( e.g. , current merger shock ) is @xmath63% .",
    "models in which the current rate of particle injection provides a small but significant fraction of the total electron energy have hybrid spectra . at low frequencies ( @xmath64 hz ) , they have an extended hump of emission , with a rapid fall off above @xmath65 hz .",
    "however , they also have an extended hard tail of emission at high frequencies , which has a power - law spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath56 . at the bottom of fig.[fig : ic ] , there is a scale which shows the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum involved .",
    "fig.[fig : ic ] shows that the fluxes from different models all tend to agree at frequencies @xmath15@xmath66 hz , which corresponds to a photon energy of @xmath1580 ev .",
    "thus , euv and very soft x - ray emission might be expected to be a universal property of clusters of galaxies , if they have all produced populations of relativistic electrons with total energies which are at least @xmath15@xmath67 of their thermal energies .",
    "the one constraint is that at least a portion of these particles must have been injected at moderate to low redshifts , @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that essentially all of the models produce a strong and similar flux at euv energies may help to explain the fact the excess euv emission has been detected in all of the cluster observed with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) satellite and which lie in directions of sufficiently low galactic columns that this radiation is observable ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a , b ; mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ; sarazin & lieu 1998 ) .",
    "values of @xmath68 at a frequency of @xmath69 hz are listed in table  3 of sarazin ( 1999 ) . from these values",
    ", one finds that the emission at euv energies is fairly directly related to @xmath70 , the total amount of energy injected in electrons with @xmath33 .",
    "the average relationship is about @xmath71 models which are likely to apply to real clusters agree with equation  ( [ eq : euv_lum ] ) to within a factor of 4 .",
    "while the amount of euv emission is fairly constant from model to model , the spectrum depends strongly on the amount of recent particle injection .",
    "very steeply declining spectra occur in models without current particle acceleration and with small values of @xmath35 . for many of the models",
    ", the spectral can be fit by a power - law with @xmath72 , but very large negative values also occur .",
    "the spectrum drops more rapidly with frequency as the proportion of electrons which are currently being accelerated decreases .",
    "because the _ euve _ observations of clusters have no spectral resolution , there is no detailed information on the observed spectrum of euv emission ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a , b ; mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ) . however , the ratio of _ euve _ fluxes to those in the softest bands of the _ rosat _ pspc suggest that the euv spectra are generally steeply declining .",
    "the spectra of the coma cluster is less steeply declining than that of abell 1795 ; this might be understood as the result of particle acceleration by merger shocks , since coma appears to be undergoing a merger or mergers ( e.g. , burns et al .",
    "1994 ) , while abell 1795 appears regular and relaxed ( e.g. , briel & henry 1996 ) .",
    "also , the euv spectra appear to get steeper with increasing radius in the abell 1795 cluster ( mittaz , lieu , & lockman 1998 ) . this might be the result of decreasing gas density with radius , which will decrease the effect of coulomb loses at low energies ( fig.[fig : lifetime ] ) .      at photon energies of 0.5 to 10 kev ,",
    "the dominant emission in most clusters is the thermal emission from the hot icm , and ic emission will be difficult to detect .",
    "however , at energies @xmath7320 kev , ic emission should again become observable , assuming that it is dropping as power - law function of frequency , while the thermal emission drops as an exponential .",
    "ic emission at photon energies of @xmath1550 kev will be produced by electrons with @xmath17 .",
    "these particles have rather short lifetimes ( @xmath74 yr ) , and are only present in clusters in which there has been substantial electron acceleration since @xmath29 . as fig.[fig : ic ] shows , only the models with current or very recent particle acceleration have any significant hxr emission .",
    "because of the short lifetimes of the particles producing hxr emission , these electrons are likely to be close to steady - state if present in significant quantities",
    ". the expected steady - state spectral index if ic losses dominated would be @xmath75 .",
    "the best - fit spectral indices are flatter than this , @xmath76 , mainly because other loss processes are important at the lower energy end of the hxr band ( fig.[fig : losses ] ) .",
    "all of the hxr spectral shapes in the models are very similar , as expected for steady - state populations .",
    "the differences in the hxr luminosities just reflect differences in the present rate of electron acceleration . to a good approximation ,",
    "the present day value of the hard x - ray ic luminosity @xmath77 ( 20100 kev ) is simply given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total present rate of injection of energy in cosmic ray electrons with @xmath80 .",
    "the best - fit coefficient ( 0.17 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : hxr_lum ] ) depends somewhat on the power - law index of the injected electrons ; the value of 0.17 applies for @xmath32 .",
    "the same relativistic electrons which produce hxr emission by ic scattering will also produce radio emission by synchrotron emission . the synchrotron radio emission from these models",
    "is given in sarazin ( 1999 ) .",
    "electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath8 produce radio emission with @xmath81 mhz , and rather high electron energies ( @xmath82 ) are needed to produce observable radio emission .",
    "thus , these are likely to be the same electrons which produce the hardest hxr emission .",
    "in general , hxr emission and radio synchrotron emission are expected only in clusters with very recent or current acceleration of relativistic electrons .",
    "thus , both measure the current rate of particle injection . for example , if the particles are accelerated in icm shocks , hxr and radio emission would be expected only in clusters which are currently undergoing ( or which very recently underwent ) a merger .",
    "recently , excess hard x - ray emission has been detected in the coma ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) and abell  2199 ( kaastra , bleeker , & mewe 1998 ) clusters with @xmath16 .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this hxr radiation to ic emission from higher energy electrons . of course , coma has a radio halo and abundant evidence for merger activity .",
    "thus , it is consistent with this hypothesis , although the required magnetic field ( @xmath83 @xmath84 g ) is smaller than might have been expected .",
    "on the other hand , abell  2199 is a relaxed cluster with a strong cooling flow .",
    "it has no radio halo emission , with an upper limit on the radio flux which is inconsistent with the ic interpretation of the hxr emission unless @xmath85 @xmath84 g ( kempner & sarazin 1999 ) .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the hxr in abell  2199 is due to ic scattering of cmb photons .",
    "it is possible that part of the hxr emission may be due to nonthermal bremsstrahlung ( bremsstrahlung from superthermal but not strongly relativistic electrons ) .",
    "one also expects that the lower energy portion of the cosmic ray population in clusters will produce diffuse optical and uv emission .",
    "diffuse optical emission is known to exist in many clusters , particularly in those with central cd galaxies ( e.g. , boughn & uson 1997 ) .",
    "although the origin is not completely understood , the optical colors of the diffuse light suggest that it is due to old stars , which may have been stripped from cluster galaxies .",
    "it is likely that the near or vacuum uv are better regions to detect low surface brightness diffuse emission due to ic emission , since the older stellar population in e and s0 galaxies ( and , presumably , the intracluster stellar population ) are fainter there .",
    "the ic optical - uv emission from the models is given in sarazin ( 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted fluxes are rather low when compared to the diffuse optical emission seen in clusters of galaxies or to the sensitivity of current and uv instruments for detecting diffuse emission .",
    "the uv powers of most of the models lie within a relatively narrow range of about an order of magnitude .",
    "unless the electron density in the icm is much higher than 0.001 @xmath6 and coulomb losses are catastrophic or the electron population in clusters is very old , one would always expect a significant population of lower energy electrons .",
    "the ic spectra in the optical and uv are fairly flat , with spectral indices of @xmath86 . in models with current electron acceleration",
    ", the lower energy electron population should be approaching steady - state with the coulomb losses , and the expected power - law for the ic emission is @xmath57 . for models without current acceleration ,",
    "the electron spectrum is expected to be nearly flat at low energies , and the @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the spectral index should be slightly positive in these models .",
    "the same relativistic elections and ions will produce gamma - ray emission .",
    "this involves a wide variety of physical processes ; in the interest of brevity , only the region around 100 mev will be discussed here .",
    "the two major emission processes in this region of the gamma - ray spectrum are electron bremsstrahlung ( due to collisions between relativistic electrons and thermal ions and electrons ) , and @xmath18 decay , due to collisions between relativistic ions and thermal ions ) .",
    "fig.[fig : gamma ] shows the predicted spectrum for the coma cluster .",
    "the electron population was determined by the ic emission required to fit the observed _ euve _ flux and _ euve / rosat _ flux ratio ( lieu et al .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath18 decay component to the bremsstrahlung component is determined by the ratio of relativistic ions to electrons . in fig.[fig : gamma ] , this ratio was taken to be 10 .",
    "the predicted flux of gamma - rays with @xmath88 mev is about @xmath89 cts/@xmath90/s . for comparison ,",
    "the _ egret _ upper limit on the flux from coma in this range is @xmath91 cts/@xmath90/s ( sreekumar et al .",
    "thus , it seems certain that _ glast _ will detect coma and many other clusters , assuming that the detected euv emission from clusters is due to ic from relativistic electrons .",
    "the measurement of the gamma - ray spectrum in the region around 100 mev will allow the ratio of relativistic ions to electrons to be determined .",
    "in many astrophysical environments , this is an unknown quantity .",
    "the _ egret _",
    "limit already implies that this ratio is @xmath92 in the coma cluster ."
