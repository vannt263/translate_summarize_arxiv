    "the origin and the evolution of the large scale structures attract much attention and the understanding about the statistical nature of the mass distributions in the universe is one of the important issues to be addressed in the observational cosmology .",
    "the inflationary theory gives us a definite prediction on the statistical properties , namely the random gaussian nature of the initial density fluctuation .",
    "the density fluctuation evolves by gravitational instability to have the non - linear distribution , i.e. non - gaussianity , at later stage whose details may depend on the cosmological parameters as well as the nature of dark matter .",
    "thus the measurement of statistical properties of the density distribution is very important for the understanding of the formation and evolution of large scale structures .",
    "the topology of large scale structures was qualitatively described by @xcite and its quantitative study was initiated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and has been studied by many authors on the basis of various observational data . for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite investigated the genus or the euler - poincae characteristic statistics of the topology in two - dimensional fields of galaxy distribution .",
    "further , the method has been applied for various kinds of observational samples , the angular distributions of galaxies on the sky @xcite , the galaxy distributions in slices of the universe @xcite and the temperature fluctuation fields of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "recently the topology of the galaxy distributions in 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey and sloan digital sky survey has been studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the topology of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution is consistent with the random phase gaussian distribution with a possible weak meat - ball topology where the topology is called meat - ball when it looks like collection of isolated islands .",
    "more recently , @xcite calculated the two - dimensional genus statistics for the contour maps of the galaxy distribution in the hubble deep field . using the red - shift distribution of galaxies measured by the method of photometric red - shift , they studied the evolution effect in the topology",
    "however , the genus curves was consistent with random gaussian field , and they were not able to discover any meaningful red - shift dependence .",
    "previous topological studies using galaxy distributions suffer from the biasing effect between visible galaxies and underlying mass distributions and it is not clear whether the galaxy distribution traces mass distribution in the universe precisely .",
    "thus it would be very useful to develop a method to measure mass distributions in the universe directly .",
    "we shall make use of weak gravitational lensing techniques for this purpose .",
    "weak lensing directly measures the projected mass distributions from the observed image distortions of background galaxies and thus can be used to compare the observational results directly with the theoretical and/or numerical predictions .",
    "the reliability of the weak lensing techniques for measuring the mass distributions on large scales has been widely recognized , for example , by cosmic shear measurements @xcite .",
    "our method for addressing this problem makes use of the genus curves for weak lensing maps of the convergence field . @xcite",
    "have studied quantitatively the method based on two dimensional minkowski functionals ( the genus curve is one of the minkowski functionals ) via @xmath1-body and ray - tracing simulations , and demonstrated its feasibility in the determination of the cosmological density parameter , @xmath2 . using the two dimensional genus statistic , @xcite also studied the topology of weak lensing fields , and found that the genus curve for large smoothing angles agrees with the predictions from linear theory , while that for smoothing angles smaller than @xmath3 shows the non - gaussian signatures of gravitational clustering and differs for open and flat cold dark matter models .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the first measurement of genus curves for the two - dimensional mass map in the neighborhood of distant rich galaxy cluster ms1054 - 03 , reconstructed from weak lensing data obtained by suprime - cam ( subaru prime focus camera ) on @xmath4 m subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "we examine the non - gaussian feature in the measured genus curve by comparing it with a gaussian prediction , and demonstrate the feasibility of the method to examine the statistical properties of the large scale mass distributions in the universe .",
    "we observed the rich , x - ray - luminous galaxy cluster ms1054 - 03 at @xmath0 on the night of 2001 march 29 using suprime - cam mounted at the prime focus of @xmath4 m subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "we obtained a mosaic of @xmath5-band images with a total exposure time of @xmath6 ksec , which covers the sky area of @xmath7 arcmin@xmath8 with the seeing fwhm of @xmath9 . for weak lensing analysis",
    ", we selected galaxies of @xmath10 with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than @xmath11 in the central @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 region .",
    "the number of objects in the weak - lensing catalog is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 arcmin@xmath13 ) .",
    "we have reconstructed the projected mass distribution from the image distortions of sample galaxies via kaiser & squires method @xcite in fourier space .",
    "we first calculated the gaussian smoothed shear field with @xmath16 from the weak lensing catalog , where the gaussian window is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "the shear map is then 100% zero - padded on each side to avoid spurious effects from periodic boundary condition . in figure",
    "[ fig_1 ] , we show the reconstructed convergence map with a side length of @xmath18 and pixel size of @xmath19",
    ". the reconstructed convergence map shows a significant mass peak with s / n of @xmath20 associated with the rich cluster ms1054 - 03 .",
    "the genus statistic provides a topological description of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "since the weak lensing field is mapped on the sky , the two dimensional genus statistic is used in this case . for the local convergence field @xmath21",
    "shown in figure [ fig_1 ] , we consider contour lines of a threshold value labelled by @xmath22 .",
    "the threshold @xmath22 is usually taken as @xmath23 for random gaussian field , where @xmath24 is the rms of the field , @xmath25 .",
    "the genus curve is expressed as function of this threshold level @xmath22 .",
    "the two dimensional genus @xmath26 is intuitively defined as @xcite , @xmath27    for a random gaussian field , the genus curve is analytically given by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "let us consider the meaning of value of the genus .",
    "if the value of genus is positive , then there is more isolated clusters than isolated voids and thus we can get an image that the topology is collection of isolated islands .",
    "so , when the value of genus takes large positive value , the topology is compared to meat - ball. on the other hand , if the value of genus is negative , there is less isolated clusters than isolated voids . in this case",
    "the topology gives an image of the complicated shape with a lot of holes , and the topology is compared to swiss cheese. thus we say the genus curve shows a meat - ball shift and swiss cheese shift when the curve deviates from gaussian shape to positive direction and to negative direction , respectively .",
    "gaussian expression of equation [ eq_2 ] is not expected for the present weak lensing data because the survey area is not large enough to probe the linear scales .",
    "however , it is known that the shape of the genus curve of mass distribution fields is not strongly affected by nonlinear gravitational evolution as shown by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus we use the method of rescaled labeling of @xmath22 . for non - gaussian fields",
    ", the threshold is defined through the fraction of area @xmath31 on the high - density side of the contour lines , which is related to the corresponding value of @xmath22 for a gaussian field as , @xmath32 for a gaussian field , this definition gives the same result as specifying the threshold directly in units of @xmath24 . on the other hand , for a non - gaussian field",
    ", it compensates for the horizontal shift of the genus curve due to the shift of distribution function of the density field .",
    "we adopt this prescription for setting the threshold values of @xmath21 in the results shown below .    to calculate the genus curves for the convergence map given as pixel data , we employed the method developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that this code gives the same result as from contour2d developed by @xcite . at each threshold level @xmath22 , the genus",
    "is obtained as an average over three genus values with @xmath22s shifted by 0 and @xmath330.1 as done in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows the genus curve measured from the convergence field shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "the gaussian prediction curve is also calculated by equation [ eq_2 ] , with the normalization factor obtained from the least-@xmath34 fitting to the measured genus curve .",
    "the errors for the genus measurements are estimated from @xmath35-bootstrap resamplings of the background galaxies .",
    "we evaluated the curvature only at interior vertices for genus calculation .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] shows a clear difference between the random gaussian prediction curve and the curve measured from the observational data .",
    "furthermore , we found that compared with the random gaussian prediction , the observed curve was shifted upwards near the threshold of @xmath36 .",
    "this indicates that the number of isolated clusters dominates over number of isolated voids , which is the so called meat - ball shift. this phenomenon is usually seen when the field evolves into non - gaussian from gaussian .",
    "however , it is difficult to judge from this result shown in figure [ fig_2 ] whether this non - gaussianity for the genus curve is influenced by the rich cluster contained in this region or by the large scale structures .    to clarify the origin of the non - gaussian nature , we divided the reconstructed convergence map into four square regions with the same size , and calculated the genus curve for each sub - region .",
    "as indicated in figure [ fig_3 ] , we call each sub - region as region 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . the rich cluster ms1054 - 03 is contained in region 3 .    figure [ fig_3 ] shows the genus curves for the sub - regions and their best - fit gaussian genus curves , obtained in the same way as for the whole field . from figure [ fig_3 ] , we see that the genus curve for the region 3 has a large skew and a meat - ball shift. on the other hand , the genus curves for the regions 2 and 4 are consistent with random gaussian curves .",
    "the genus curve for the region 1 shows a slight excess in the high threshold region .",
    "our weak lensing analysis shows a significant mass concentration associated with the rich cluster , therefore the highly non - gaussian feature in the genus curve could be induced by this rich cluster in the region 3 .",
    "the skewness is also a powerful statistical tool to measure the deviation from a random gaussian distribution , defined by @xmath37 .",
    "we summarized in table [ tab_1 ] the skewness measured for each sub - region .",
    "we see the skewness for the region 3 is quite larger than that for any other region .",
    "we have measured for the first time the genus curves of the convergence map reconstructed from image distortions of faint background galaxies , as the first step for addressing the statistical properties of the mass distributions on large scales .",
    "the genus curve measured in the whole survey field ( figure [ fig_1 ] ) shows a deviation from the random gaussian prediction , i.e. non - gaussianity of the field . by dividing the whole map into four independent regions and analyzing them",
    "separately , we showed that the non - gaussianity is induced by the rich cluster contained in the survey region ( region 3 ) . on the other hand , as for the regions without the rich cluster",
    ", we also found a slight excess of the genus amplitude in the high - thresholds for region 1 , whereas the genus curves for regions 2 and 4 are consistent with random gaussian distributions .",
    "we thus averaged the genus curves of the regions 1 , 2 , and 4 by inverse variance weighting at each threshold bin .",
    "the resulting genus curve shown in figure [ fig_4 ] is consistent with the random gaussian one at each threshold bin within @xmath38 error .",
    "we thus conclude the excess of the genus curve in region 1 is not due to the non - gaussianity but is caused by the sample variance due to the small area of the region as discussed by @xcite .",
    "our results might be influenced by the choice of smoothing angle ( @xmath39 in the paper ) .",
    "the effective number of galaxies used for the local shear average decreases as smoothing angle decreases , and then the reconstructed convergence map is much influenced by the random noise due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxy ellipticities .",
    "thus the genus curves approach to the random gaussian predictions as smoothing angles become smaller .",
    "@xcite discussed the effects of the smoothing angle on the genus measurements by the simulations with survey area of about @xmath40 degree@xmath8 .",
    "they concluded that for the smoothing angle of @xmath41 , the genus curve shows a non - gaussian meat - ball shift. on smoothing angles smaller than @xmath42 , it is not clear yet whether the observed non - gaussianity is real or not .",
    "we have not used @xmath41 because it could decrease the number of independent samplings , and thus affect our analysis .    in order to clearly see the deviation due to large scale structure , we definitely need to observe much wider region which will be planned in the near future survey by suprime - cam on subaru telescope .",
    "the present study demonstrates the feasibility of the genus statistic for the weak lensing mass maps to examine directly the statistical properties of the large scale mass distributions in the universe .",
