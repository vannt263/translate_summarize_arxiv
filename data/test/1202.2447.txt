    "recent studies of high frequency ( hf ) data for foreign exchange ( fx ) rates @xcite regarded the many daily realizations of asset returns as constituting a statistical ensemble of histories .",
    "the single hf time series from which such ensembles can be extracted are known to present clear periodic patterns , with period of one day ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and therein cited references ) .",
    "for example , in the eur / usd case , the volatility over successive 10 minutes intervals monotonically increases or decreases during specific time windows within the day .",
    "this behaviour is observed by averaging the volatility on both a daily and a weakly basis .",
    "the idea in @xcite is to endogenize the periodic , nearly deterministic behavior of the eur / usd exchange rate hf volatility into a time inhomogeneous stochastic process for the evolution of the asset .",
    "the analysis of the ensemble of daily histories produced by such a process reveals also a peculiar form of scaling obeyed by the probability density functions ( pdf ) of the returns , once they are aggregated over intervals of variable span within a fixed intraday window ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we recall that the scaling symmetry is a relation linking the marginal pdf of a stochastic process with the duration of sampling or observation interval . in the simplest case of time intervals starting at the beginning of the daily window ,",
    "the scaling property observed for eur / usd exchange rate implies that the pdf @xmath0 for a return @xmath1 over an interval of width @xmath2 , once multiplied by a factor @xmath3 , yields a specific function of @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scaling function , and @xmath7 is a suitable scaling exponent .",
    "this form leads to @xmath8 , for any arbitrary rescaling @xmath9 of the interval duration @xmath2 , and means that the pdf of the returns has a known structure , independently from the duration of sampling intervals . a process with such a property",
    "is thus called _ self - similar_. as a consequence , if we observe an ensemble of histories generated by a self - similar stochastic process and data are available for instance at a 30 minutes frequency , the scaling relation makes it possible to construct the densities of the stochastic process at both finer and time - aggregated durations .",
    "moreover , an hf self - similar process allows ( unconditional ) density forecasts for any future horizon ( say from few minutes to several hours ) .",
    "such a possibility is relevant for structural analysis of hf data , for financial forecasting , and , as we argue in the following , for the identification of efficient trading rules .",
    "the hf scaling symmetry ( [ eq_scaling ] ) addressed in @xcite has further interesting aspects : @xmath6 is non - gaussian and @xmath7 is definitely lower than @xmath10 . on the basis of the stability of the gaussian density under time aggregation",
    ", one would expect @xmath11 and a gaussian @xmath6 for independent returns . on the other hand , a scaling with @xmath12 , but a non - gaussian @xmath6 , is generally found in the empirical analysis of the pdf of aggregated returns for intervals sliding along a single , long historical time series .",
    "the deviation from gaussianity found for the pdf of returns sampled in this way is an anomalous scaling feature generally ascribed to long range dependence ( as revealed , e.g. , by the presence of volatility clustering and heteroskedasticity with persistent behaviours ) .",
    "however , for efficient markets one still has @xmath13 @xcite . in the hf eur / usd case",
    "mentioned above , besides non - gaussianity the strong deviation of @xmath7 from @xmath10 emphasizes the anomalous character of the scaling and implies the time - inhomogeneity ( non - stationarity ) of the returns process . in particular , in @xcite the time inhomogeneous scaling has been attributed to a non - markovian , strong dependence of the intraday returns , as , e.g. , manifested by the analysis of the ensemble - averaged volatility autocorrelation function .",
    "this strong dependence amounts to an effective volatility clustering phenomenon , partially hidden by the fact that the average volatility reduces in time when @xmath14 . by imposing consistency with the anomalous scaling of the aggregated return pdf ,",
    "a mathematical model has been then introduced for generating the histories in the ensemble . within this model ,",
    "the pdf of each return retains memory of the previous ones .",
    "once properly calibrated , the model replicates very well the statistical properties of the empirical hf ensemble in the case of eur / usd data .",
    "in particular , it is able to reproduce the patterns observed on autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of returns , absolute returns , and squared returns obtained from the hf time series .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the non - markovian model introduced in @xcite to the description of the hf data of a different financial asset , namely the s & p 500 index .",
    "a first goal is to show that the model is able to replicate the features of an asset different from fx exchange rates .",
    "more importantly , we will show how it might be used to develop an efficient intra - day trading rule , exposing a small arbitrage opportunity .",
    "this empirical application builds on the scaling property and is made under the assumption of correct model specifications .",
    "the process proposed in @xcite , conditionally to a minimum information input , i.e. the opening price and eventually the first few 10-minutes returns , can be used to provide long - range density forecasts ( for several steps ahead within a given daily time range ) .",
    "we compute density forecasts also using a simpler and more standard garch process @xcite ; namely , the asymmetric gjr model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the density forecasts obtained from our model and those of the garch benchmark are used to define price bounds whose violation gives a trading signal .",
    "the bounds might be interpreted as predicted supports and resistances , or they could be read as a simulated price range with a given confidence interval .",
    "our approach thus belongs to the large plethora of technical analysis - based trading methods whose performances have been studies by different authors , @xcite , among others . however , the indicators used to derive the trading signals are model - based and not derived from a pure _ chartist _ approach . in - sample and",
    "out - of - sample tests demonstrate the existence of trading opportunities , leading , anyhow , to relatively small average margins of profit . as a matter of fact ,",
    "those profits vary over time , reaching interesting values in specific periods and always beating the average profits associated with the garch model .",
    "the paper proceeds as follow . in subsection 1.1",
    "we briefly describe the data used within this study , while section 2 is devoted to the presentation of the model and to parameter calibration . section 3 deals with the construction of density forecasts , and section 4",
    "describes the trading strategy and provides the empirical results .",
    "section 5 concludes .      in this work we focus on the analysis of the s&p 500 index .",
    "we consider a dataset ranging from september 30th 1985 to october 20th 2010 . after excluding those days for which the records are not complete ( _ e.g. _ , for holidays or stock exchange anticipated closures ) , the whole dataset includes @xmath15 trading days .",
    "for each single day @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , we extract the index values , @xmath18 , every 10 minutes between 9:40 a.m. ( when we set @xmath19 ) and 13:00 a.m. ( @xmath20 ) , new york time .",
    "our time unit , @xmath21 minutes , is fixed by the characteristics of the dataset at our disposal . from one side",
    "it ensures that linear correlation effects among consecutive returns are negligible ; on the other side , however , it poses a bias on the effectiveness of the strategy proposed in the following , since trading actions can be executed only with a certain time - delay induced by the @xmath21-minute database discreteness .",
    "the empirical returns of the @xmath16-th day on the time - scale @xmath2 are then defined as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and are regarded as specific realizations of stochastic variables @xmath25 . in this way , our ensemble amounts to @xmath15 realizations of the stochastic process @xmath26 , with logarithmic unit increments @xmath27 .",
    "below , @xmath28 refers to a generic realization of the random variable @xmath29 . wherever appropriate , to simplify our formulas we will switch to the simpler notation @xmath30 and @xmath31 . similarly , @xmath32 will indicate the @xmath33-th return on a @xmath21-minute - scale in the @xmath16-th history realization of our ensemble .",
    "our first task is thus to identify a proper analytical model for the joint pdf of the returns @xmath34 , @xmath35 , for any @xmath23 , which correctly reproduces the statistics of the ensemble @xmath36 .",
    "in @xcite it has been suggested that hf financial time - series for the fx exchange rates offer the opportunity to deal with many realizations of the same stochastic process every day .",
    "the set of daily histories , restricted to suitable time - windows , can thus be regarded as an ensemble for testing the statistical properties of the underlying process .",
    "in fact these histories are not completely independent , because heteroskedasticity and volatility correlations , if estimated by time averages along the whole time series @xmath37 from which the ensemble @xmath38 is extracted , definitely exceed the intraday range . however , for a large enough total number of days @xmath39 in the time series one can expect inter - day correlations effects to vanish , allowing for a reliable statistics of the postulated ensemble .    the general ideas at the basis of the mathematical model adopted here to describe such an ensemble can be traced back in @xcite .",
    "financial market returns in the hf ensemble relative to the eur / usd exchange rate are linearly uncorrelated if taken over intervals of 10 minutes or more .",
    "however , they are also dependent , as shown , e.g. , by the nonzero volatility autocorrelation function . based on these evidences and on the existence of time inhomogeneous anomalous scaling properties ( see below ) , it has been proposed that the joint pdf s of these returns have the form of convex combinations of the joint pdf s of processes with independent gaussian increments of different , time dependent widths .",
    "this implies that the scaling function @xmath6 of the aggregated return pdf is also a convex combination of gaussians of variable width @xcite , as often assumed in phenomenological studies of anomalous scaling ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and cited references ) .",
    "the main feature of the time - inhomogeneous model described in @xcite is the construction of the joint pdf @xmath40 , on the basis of the scaling symmetry valid for the pdf of the aggregated return @xmath41 the pdf of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , satisfies a scaling symmetry with scaling exponent @xmath7 and scaling function @xmath6 , if , for every @xmath33 , @xmath44 [ this equation , in more precise notations , is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq_scaling ] ) ] . under the premises of this scaling symmetry , @xmath40 is then reconstructed as @xmath45 where @xmath46^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath47 is a pdf for a mixture of gaussian distributions with different widths @xmath48 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and the scaling function is given by @xmath49 the coefficients @xmath50 determine the time - inhomogeneity of the variables @xmath51 s , which is also manifest in a peculiar scaling form for its pdf @xmath52 , namely , @xmath53 only for @xmath11 the variables @xmath51 s become identically distributed .",
    "see @xcite for additional details on the derivation of the joint pdf .",
    "the next step is the identification of a proper parametrization for the scaling function @xmath6 . since @xmath48 is a measure of volatility , a convenient way of representing this fat - tailed scaling function in finance ( see , @xmath54 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is through an _ inverse - gamma _ density @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are a scale and a form parameter , respectively . as a simplifying assumption",
    ", we disregard the weak skewness of the return distribution , whose inclusion in the modeling framework is currently under development .",
    "the resulting scaling function @xmath59 has then a power - law decay for large @xmath60 with exponent @xmath61 , whereas @xmath62 simply sets the scale of its width . within this parametrization",
    ", @xmath6 is thus identified in terms of the two parameters @xmath62 and @xmath58 .    in this paper",
    "we extend the application of this model to the s&p 500 index , working with a larger set of realizations ( @xmath15 ) with respect to the eur / usd dataset used in @xcite .",
    "the larger database enables us to reduce the statistical uncertainties of the empirical quantities .",
    "interestingly , we find that the same general features of the dynamics of the eur / usd exchange rate also characterize the s&p 500 index and that they are both very well reproduced by the above model . in the appendix",
    "we give an account of these results , which include the observation of a systematic decrease of the empirical second moment of the elementary intraday returns ( over intervals of @xmath21 minutes ) as a function of time ( time - inhomogeneity ) , the vanishing of their linear correlation at and above the elementary time - scale , and the presence of strong non - linear correlations . in the next section",
    "we report instead the empirical evidence used to calibrate the three parameters @xmath63 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath7 and the scaling function @xmath6 play here a central role as they define respectively the @xmath50 s and @xmath64 appearing in the joint pdf of a given daily realization of the process .",
    "for the purposes of this study , we adopt a two step calibration procedure . at first , we determine @xmath7 , and then we use @xmath7 in order to obtain a data - collapse which allows identifying @xmath55 .    a quantitative way to calibrate @xmath7 is offered by the analysis of the moments of @xmath42 .",
    "a simple integration shows that if @xmath43 satisfies eq .",

    "[ fig : nl_moments ] we plot the results of the linear regression , @xmath67 , of the logarithm of the time evolution of the empirical moments @xmath68 the resulting regression slope @xmath69 , identifies the value of @xmath7 and gives a proof of the anomalous scaling symmetry [ eq .",
    "( [ eq_simple_scaling ] ) ] satisfied by the empirical s&p 500 data .",
    "quite remarkably , this value is very close to that estimated for fx exchange rates in refs .",
    "it is important to point out that we limit our scaling analysis to @xmath70 because of an evident multiscaling behaviour for @xmath71 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "taking advantage of the knowledge of the scaling exponent @xmath72 , a @xmath73 minimization algorithm shows that the values @xmath74 and @xmath75 adequately fit ( see fig .  [ fig : scaling_fcn ] ) the data - collapse plot obtained via eq .",
    "( [ eq_simple_scaling ] ) .",
    "these three parameter values , calibrated upon the entire available history , are used for in - sample evaluations of the model and subsequent trading strategies .",
    "however , we are interested in performing out - of - sample analyses also . in such cases , starting from our 25-years database , we decided to use the first 15 years of data ( from 1985 to 1999 ) to identify specific values for the parameters @xmath76 to be used to realize the trading strategy for the year 2000 .",
    "we then repeatedly shifted year by year , always using the 15 previous years to calibrate the model , until 2009 ( the last complete year ) .",
    "so , @xmath54 , we used the data from 1994 to 2008 to fit the scaling function for the strategy to be used for year 2009 .",
    "[ fig : parameters ] shows the optimal parameter values used for the implementation of the out - of - sample strategies from 2000 to 2009 .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath7 slightly increases over time and stabilize from 2005 to 2009 .",
    "in contrast , the parameters characterizing the _ inverse - gamma _ density show evidence of a clear drop once the crisis period of 2008 is introduced in the calibration sample ( see , @xmath54 , the comparison between the _ inverse - gamma _ s of year 2005 and 2009 presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : inverse_gammas ] ) .",
    "the model proposed here and in @xcite has implicit density forecasting capabilities . indeed , assuming correct model specifications , given the parameter values and the first daily return , it determines the pdf of the daily evolution of returns .",
    "this determination is not limited to each single return , but _ extends to any aggregation of returns _ within the validity of the scaling symmetry .",
    "such a possibility allows the construction of a trading strategy based on density forecasts .",
    "furthermore , at each point in time within the chosen scaling window , the forecasts for the remaining part might be updated using the additional intra - daily information .",
    "for this reason , we consider in the following two different trading approaches : the first makes use of the opening value of the traded asset at the beginning of the chosen time - window , @xmath77 , and then bases only on this value the density forecasts for the remaining part of it ( we call it _ unconditional trading _ ) ; in the second approach the density forecasts are updated using the information of the most recent returns ( the _ conditional trading _ , since the forecast is conditioned to the fresh intraday information ) . with",
    "both trading approaches it is possible to extract trading signals from density forecasts : given a certain quantile @xmath78 , if at a certain time within the intra - daily range under study the observed market price is above ( below ) the @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) quantile of the predicted price density we have a buy ( sell ) signal .",
    "in this case , for each day @xmath16 , we calculate the quantiles for the expected price at time @xmath33 , conditioned to the opening value @xmath77 only .",
    "note that our approach , in computing the density forecasts , does not rely on specific previous - days asset information .",
    "it is assumed that all the information contained in the past observations has been compressed in the model parameters , namely @xmath76 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_joint_probability ] ) , the pdf for the return @xmath51 , @xmath52 , is given by : @xmath81 the lower - bound values of the expected returns , @xmath82 , @xmath83 for the lower quantiles @xmath80 are then easily obtained by numerically solving the following equation with respect to @xmath82 @xmath84 due to the parity of the scaling function @xmath59 , the corresponding upper - bound values @xmath85 are simply obtained via sign flip : @xmath86 .",
    "the lower and upper expected values of @xmath26 can then be easily calculated , because @xmath26 is a monotonic function of the @xmath51 s , namely , @xmath87 and so the quantiles of @xmath26 are directly related to the quantiles of @xmath51 , once the daily opening value is given . in order to simplify our notations",
    ", we will drop the explicit dependence of the quantiles of @xmath26 on the trading day , and indicate them as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    summarizing , for every choice of @xmath80 with @xmath78 , for every time @xmath33 from 1 to 20 within each trading day ,",
    "two price barriers are obtained , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "with probability @xmath90 the price at time @xmath33 is placed between these values . for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : day_1 ] the results of the in - sample analysis for the first day of the dataset ( september 30th , 1985 ) are shown . as explained below in details , the comparison between these barrier values and the actual real market price lead us to the definition of a buy or sell action .",
    "the empirical analysis considers both in - sample and out - of - sample cases .",
    "the difference between the two is that for the former a unique set of values @xmath76 is used , calibrated with the whole 25-year dataset , while in the latter case the parameters @xmath76 are calibrated each year , on the basis of the previous 15-year history .",
    "for both approaches we will use the quantiles @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , respectively ) .      to exploit the non - markovian character of our model , besides the opening value of the day , @xmath77 , we can use the value of , say , the first return of the day @xmath93 to condition the subsequent expected evolution of the index . using the model prediction for the joint pdf of the returns [ eq . ( [ eq_joint_probability ] ) ]",
    ", we can build a conditioned scheme where , for example , the first return is used to condition the successive probability densities : @xmath94 more generally , we can write the following expression , conditioning to the first @xmath95 returns the pdf of the successive @xmath96 returns , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 : @xmath99 the construction of the price barriers @xmath88 and @xmath89 proceeds then as described in the previous section , simply replacing the joint pdf @xmath35 with the conditional pdf @xmath100 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : day_2101 ] some interesting features of conditional trading signals can be detected .",
    "in particular , it is clear the influence of the nearest past returns to determine the expected amplitude of the next ones .",
    "conditional trading will thus be based on bounds which are not fixed within the day but may vary according to the new information included in the most recent market prices .",
    "when the index value @xmath101 breaks through the lower @xmath88 or the upper @xmath89 quantile , this violation can be used to define a trading strategy . note that the ensemble property we observe lasts from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. as a consequence , we define a trading strategy which operates within this time lapse . to avoid the impact of news arrivals between 1 p.m. and the opening of the next day , the trading strategy opens and closes positions within the day .",
    "furthermore , since we are using a @xmath21-minute dataset , density forecasts ( and therefore the quantiles at level @xmath80 ) will be available from 9:40 a.m ..    within a certain day @xmath16 , given its specific quantiles at level @xmath80 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the trading signals and the trading activity are defined as follows :    * if there are no open positions * * buy if @xmath102 * * sell if @xmath103 * if there are open positions * * close a long position if @xmath104 * * close a short position if @xmath105 * * close long or short positions if they are still in place at 1 p.m.    by construction , multiple trades are possible within volatile days . differently , in trending days , single operations will take place , while during stable days , no positions will be taken .",
    "our purpose is to monitor the performances of the trading strategy defined above .",
    "therefore , we simulate the time evolution of a trader using our strategy and having an initial cash amount equal to 1 million . given the previous remarks about the validity of the ensemble properties and their link with the trading strategy , at the beginning of the day and at 1 p.m. the simulated portfolio is entirely composed by cash .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid losses larger than the portfolio value when implementing short positions , we limit the investment value to 90% of the overall portfolio value . for symmetry",
    ", we apply the same rule also for long positions . as a result , when trades are created ,",
    "10% of the portfolio remains in cash .",

    "profits are indicated as average basis points per trade , and distinguishing also between long and short trades .",
    "this allows to verify if the strategy better identifies signals in a specific direction .",
    "three elements clearly appear .",
    "the first one is that the profit decreases with decreasing quantile values , as if stronger signals provide smaller performances irrespective of the trade sign .",
    "we explain such an unexpected result by the fact that , due to the 10-minute discreteness of our database , trades are not valued precisely at the price at which the barrier violation occurs , but with a certain delay .",
    "this time - delay ( which could be diminished using an higher - frequency dataset ) reduces the potential profit coming from relevant ( and unexpected ) price movements . those , in fact , are the price changes detected by the model - based quantiles at the 5% level .",
    "the second relevant comment we make refers to the relation between average profit and conditioning information .",
    "we observe that conditioning the price barriers to the first returns of the day increases the profit .",
    "this is somewhat expected as during the first part of the day the model adapts its behaviour to the most recent data . and",
    "it provides therefore a better fit to the ensemble property within the remaining part of the day .",
    "again , such a result holds independently of the trade sign . regarding the number of conditioning values",
    ", we note that the relation between conditioning points and profits is not monotonic , and has a maximum between one and six conditioning points . as a consequence of this result and of the previous one about the quantile / profit relation , the out - of - sample analyses discussed in the next section",
    "have been performed with three conditioning points , which is the value with maximum profit for 25% quantiles .",
    "table ( [ tabb ] ) reports the same quantities as table ( [ taba ] ) , but by year ( we drop 1985 and 2010 where only part of the year was available ) . in general , the use of a 25% quantile provides the higher average profit .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the largest part of negative values are identified in the range 2004 - 2007 , where the market was clearly upward trending and in a low volatility phase .",
    "this is an expected outcome , since the model detects violations which are associated with high price fluctuations .",
    "the largest profits are located during 1986 and 1987 , in a high volatility period .",
    "overall , the average profit per trade is relatively small , and occasionally even negative . on the other hand , during some specific market phases",
    "the trading strategy provides large average profits per trade , see for instance the 90 s .",
    ".average profit per trade in basis points ( yearly values ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabf ]    overall , the results suggest the existence of some trading opportunities with respect to the time series and sample size used .",
    "furthermore , they show how the combination of advanced statistical methodologies could be used for the development of trading rules or trading schemes which have a large resemblance with those commonly used in technical analysis .",
    "in this study we realized the first practical application of a non - markovian model for asset evolution @xcite , deduced by the scaling symmetry revealed by empirical analyses .",
    "the calibration of the parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath62 and @xmath58 in the present case ) has been facilitated by the opportunity of considering the intraday evolution of a given asset within specific time - windows , as an ensemble of different histories repeating each day @xcite . while previous studies demonstrated this property for fx exchange rates , in the present context we showed that it is possible to extend this interpretation and to verify that the model proposed in @xcite correctly reproduces the empirical evidence also for the s&p 500 hf data .    in particular , performing both in - sample and out - of - sample analyses we demonstrated how the scaling properties of the stochastic process can be used to derive long - term ( intraday ) density forecasts . in turns , these density forecasts can be used to define trading signals and implement an intra - day trading strategy which exposes a small arbitrage opportunity . by comparing the trading outcomes to those obtained from a standard garch model , namely , the gjr @xcite , we showed better performances for the trading strategy based on the proposed model .",
    "the average trade profit is limited over the entire time span , even though local levels might be higher .",
    "further studies aiming at improving the trading strategy and the empirical application of the model are thus required and under development .",
    "summarizing our findings , we can say that the proposed model has some potential for the development of trading strategies aimed at hedging the volatility risk , since their performances are positive during high market volatility , and characterized by a lower risk compared to the market index .",
    "signals extracted from the model could also be considered as confirmatory signals for other strategies working with high frequency data , or could be used to detect relevant market movements .    in this empirical example",
    "we do not consider several elements that could have an impact on the trading strategy profits .",
    "we motivate this by the need of evaluating the model in comparison to a simple benchmark . across the elements we did not include",
    ", we have the trading costs .",
    "once those are introduced , the profits reported in the previous tables would be sensibly reduced . however , the trading strategy we implement is based on a fixed frequency database , using a 10-minute interval .",
    "this has a relevant impact on the trading outcomes .",
    "in fact , if a quantile violation is observed at time @xmath33 , we execute the trade with the price observed at this same point in time .",
    "however , the violation could have taken place in any instant in the ten minutes before @xmath33 .",
    "a trader using our approach would produce quantiles to be used for each period of 10 minutes , but would immediately detect the violation , and operate in the market soon after it ( assuming she / he fully trusts the signal ) . on the contrary , working with a fixed time span of 10 minutes , we lose part of the potentially relevant content of the signal , since the price at time @xmath33 might be significantly different from the real price observed at the trade execution just after the violation occurred .",
    "another element not included in our trading example is the remuneration of the bank account .",
    "in addition , overnight liquidity operations could be introduced given that the portfolio is entirely into cash from 1 p.m. of day @xmath33 up to 9:39 a.m. of day @xmath109 .",
    "finally , we note that even the trading strategy could be improved , for instance introducing stop - loss and take - profit bounds on the implemented orders .",
