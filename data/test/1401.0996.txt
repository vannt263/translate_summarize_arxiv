    "among nontopological solitons , q - balls @xcite have attracted much attention because they can exist in all supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "specifically , they can be produced efficiently in the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite .",
    "q - balls can also influence the fate of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "based on these motivations , stability of q - balls has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "these studies have also been extended to general relativistic analysis @xcite and to different - shaped solitons @xcite .",
    "another natural extension is introducing gauge coupling into a u(1 ) scalar field .",
    "because such a field is equivalent to electromagnetic field , the conserved charge @xmath2 becomes electric charge , and therefore the coulomb repulsion is expected to disturb formation of large q - balls .",
    "in fact , lee _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite began to study gauged q - balls with the potential , [ v4 ] v_4():=m^22 ^ 2-^4 +  with   m^2 ,  ,  m^2>0 , and showed that there is a maximum charge and size . to construct large q - balls , anagnostopoulos _",
    "@xcite introduced fermions with charge of the opposite sign .",
    "_ @xcite assumed a different potential , a piecewise parabolic function , and deshaies - jacques and mackenzie @xcite supposed the maxwell - chern - simons theory with the @xmath6 potential ( [ v4 ] ) in the 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime ; it was shown that there is a maximum charge and size of q - balls in both models .",
    "arod and lis @xcite considered gauged q - balls with the v - shaped potential , [ vv ] v_v():=  with   > 0 , because its three - dimensional plot has the form of a cone , it would be more appropriate to call it the cone - shaped potential .",
    "in addition to normal q - balls , which have a maximum charge , they found a new type of solutions , q - shells .",
    "q - shell solutions are obtained in such a way that the scalar field and the gauge field are assumed to be constant within a certain sphere @xmath7 and the field equations are solved numerically for @xmath8 . because the electric charge is concentrated on the shell , large q - balls with any amount of charge can exist without additional fermions .",
    "thus this model overcomes the difficulty of the @xmath6 model . however , there is another drawback that it is so simplified and singular at @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we address the question whether such large gauged q - balls can be formed in realistic or cosmologically - motivated theories without additional fermions nor a singular potential .",
    "one of the physically - motivated theories is the ad mechanism @xcite , which includes two types of potentials , gravity - mediation type and gauge - mediation type .",
    "the former is described by [ gravity ] & & v_grav.():=^2   + & & with   m_grav.^2 ,  m>0 , while the latter by [ gauge ] v_gauge():=m_gauge^4 ( 1 + )   with   m_gauge^2>0  .",
    "if we take maclaurin expansion of the two potentials in the vicinity of @xmath9 , the latter can be regarded as @xmath10 model , and is inappropriate for our purpose .",
    "thus , we concentrate on investigating gauged q - balls in the former potential .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show the basic equations of gauged q - balls . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss general properties of ordinary and gauged q - balls in words of newtonian mechanics . in sec .",
    "iv , we review previous results of @xmath10 and @xmath11 models . in sec .",
    "v , we investigate equilibrium solutions in the @xmath12 model numerically .",
    "section vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",

    "introducing a variable , ( r):=+qa_0(r ) , we obtain field equations , [ feqball ] & & + + ^2 = , + & & + = ( q)^2 . [ feqball2 ] the boundary condition we assume is & & ddr(r=0)=0 ,  ddr(r=0)=0 , [ bcqball ] + & & ( r)=0 ,  ( r)=+ , [ bcqball2 ] where @xmath16 is a constant .",

    ". equations ( [ feqball ] ) , ( [ feqball2 ] ) and ( [ qdef ] ) indicate that the sign transformation @xmath23 changes nothing but @xmath24 with keeping @xmath25 and @xmath26 unchanged .",
    "thus , we choose @xmath27 in this paper .",
    "to begin with , to understand the effect of gauge fields on q - balls , we review properties of ordinary q - ball solutions . the field equations are obtained by putting @xmath28=constant in eq.([feqball ] ) , [ feoq ] + = ,   v_:=v-12 ^ 2 ^ 2 . if one regards the radius @xmath29 as time  and the scalar amplitude @xmath26 as the position of a particle , one can understand solutions in words of newtonian mechanics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . equation ( [ feoq ] ) describes a one - dimensional motion of a particle under the nonconserved force due to the effective potential @xmath30 and the time - dependent friction @xmath31 .",
    "if one chooses the initial position  @xmath32 appropriately , the static particle begins to roll down the potential slope , climbs up and approaches the origin over infinite time .",
    "from the above picture , one can derive the existing conditions of equilibrium solutions of ordinary q - balls as follows .",
    "the first condition is that the initial altitude of the particle   @xmath33 is larger than the final altitude@xmath34 , which leads to [ cond1 ] max[-v_()]>0 ,  i.e. ,   min<^2 .",
    "the second condition is that the particle climbs up  at @xmath35 , which leads to [ cond2 ] _",
    "+ 0(-dv_d)= _ + 0(^2-dvd)<0  .",
    "if the lowest - order term of @xmath36 is quadratic , i.e. , @xmath37 , the second condition ( [ cond2 ] ) reduces to [ cond22 ] ^2<m^2=d^2vd^2 , which gives the upper limit of @xmath38 .",
    "the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond22 ] ) were originally obtained by coleman @xcite ) .",
    "we should not , however , apply the second condition ( [ cond22 ] ) to the cone - shape potential @xmath11 in ( [ vv ] ) nor the ad gravity - mediation type @xmath12 in ( [ gravity ] ) because their lowest - order term is not quadratic .",
    "instead we should go back to the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath11 , if we take @xmath39 , the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied regardless of @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath12 , if we take @xmath1 , the condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied regardless of @xmath40 .",
    "now let us move on to gauged q - balls . without specifying a potential @xmath36 , we can show that @xmath41 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath29  @xcite . using a variable @xmath42 ,",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ feqball2 ] ) as [ feqball2 - 2 ] & & = ( qr)^2 ,   = fr^2  .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath17 and @xmath43 up to the first order is expressed as f(r+r)&=&f(r_0)+(qr_0(r))^2(r)r+o(r^2),(r+r)&=&(r)+f(r)r^2r+o(r^2 ) .",
    "[ taylor]by definition @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",

    "similarly , if @xmath48 , then @xmath43 and @xmath17 decreases at every step .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath41 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath29 .",
    "we can interpret their equilibrium solutions in words of newtonian mechanics in the same fashion , except that the potential of a particle is time - dependent , v_=v-12 ^ 2 ^ 2 . because the potential energy of the particle  @xmath49 increases as the time  @xmath29 increases , the initial altitude  @xmath50 is not necessarily larger than the final altitude  @xmath51 , that is , there is no condition which corresponds to ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "however , the condition that the particle climbs up  at @xmath35 should hold , we find an existing condition , which corresponds to ( [ cond2 ] ) , [ gaugedqexist ] _ + 0(-dv_d)= _ + 0(^2-dvd)<0  .",
    "figure [ newton ] illustrates the time - dependent potential of a fictitious particle @xmath49 . as @xmath29 increases",
    ", @xmath41 also increases ; then @xmath49 goes up as shown in the figure .",
    "there are two types of solutions .",
    "one is monotonic solutions as shown in ( a ) : @xmath18 decreases monotonically as @xmath29 increases .",
    "the other is nonmonotonic solutions as shown in ( b ) : @xmath18 increase initially , but after the sign of @xmath52 changes , @xmath18 turns to decreases .",
    "the latter type exposes a characteristic of gauged q - balls , which appears in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 models .",
    "in this section we review gauged q - ball solutions in the @xmath10 model @xcite and in the @xmath11 model @xcite .      for the @xmath6 model ( [ v4 ] ) ,",
    "the necessary condition of existing equilibrium solutions ( [ gaugedqexist ] ) is expressed as [ gaugedqexist2 ] _",
    "r^2 < m^2 .",
    "because @xmath41 is an increasing function of @xmath29 , the condition ( [ gaugedqexist2 ] ) would give a rather strong constraint on the parameter range of existing equilibrium solutions .",
    "we confirm this expectation by numerical calculation as follows .",
    "we rescale the quantities as & & : = ,  : = ,   + & & : = mr ,  : = , + & & : = q^2 q ,  : = .",
    "[ rescale - v4 ] in fig .",

    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to the ordinary and gauged q - balls , respectively . in this solution , the distributions of the scalar field @xmath56 almost coincide ; however , because @xmath57 increases as a function of @xmath58 , the condition ( [ gaugedqexist2 ] ) is narrowly satisfied .",
    "actually , fig .",
    "[ newton ] ( a ) shows the effective potential of this case .",
    "equation ( [ feqball2 ] ) tells us that , in order for @xmath57 to be small in the asymptotic region , @xmath59 must also be small there ; this indicates that @xmath60 has an upper limit .      because the @xmath11 model ( [ vv ] ) has a linear term , the condition ( [ gaugedqexist ] ) is satisfied if @xmath39 .",
    "contrary to the case of the @xmath6 model , this condition does not put any restriction on @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , large gauged q - balls are expected in this model .    using the normalized coupling @xmath61 , we rescale the quantities as & & : = ,  : = ,   : = r , + & & : = q^2 q ,  : = .",

    "this behavior can be understood by the effective potential shown in fig .",
    "[ newton ] ( b ) .",

    "<S> , our numerical calculation strongly suggests that stable solutions with any amount of charge and size exist . </S>",
    "<S> as the electric charge @xmath2 increases , the field configuration of the scalar field becomes shell - like ; because the charge is concentrated on the surface , the coulomb force does not destroy the q - ball configuration . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are analogous to those in the v - shaped model , which was studied by arod and lis . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for each @xmath3 there is another sequence of unstable solutions , which is separated from the other sequence of the stable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath4 increases , the two sequences approach ; eventually at some point in @xmath5 , the  recombination \" of the two sequences takes place . </S>"
