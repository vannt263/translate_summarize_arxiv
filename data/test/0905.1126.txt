    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has revealed a very complex structure both in the stellar and in the gaseous component .",
    "the elongation of the stellar disk in the direction of the galactic center , its substantial vertical thickness , the warp and the strong asymmetric bar are naturally predicted by numerical simulations as a result of the gravitational interaction between the lmc and the galaxy ( bekki & chiba 2005 , mastropietro et al .",

    "the old stellar distribution appears to be quite smooth in the outer parts of the disk , with no signs of spiral structures out to a radius of 10 kpc @xcite . within the same radius",
    "the hi large scale structure reveals the presence of several asymmetric features that have no equivalent in the old stellar disk .",
    "the gaseous disk is characterized by the presence of an elongated region located at the south - east of the galaxy and aligned with the border of the optical disk , where the column density distribution shows a steep increase @xcite .",
    "since the lmc proper motion vector is directed to the east , it appears natural to associate this high density region with ram - pressure acting on the leading edge of the disk due to the orbital motion of the lmc and its consequent interaction with the diffuse hot gas in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the presence of an extended hot halo surrounding galaxies and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark matter potential is expected by current models of hierarchical structure formation . in the mw ,",
    "x - ray absorption lines produced by hot ( @xmath1 k ) gas are detected in the spectra of several bright agn @xcite .",
    "some ionization features discovered in the magellanic stream and high velocity clouds indicate that this distribution of hot gas extends well beyond the galactic disk ( @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "constraints from dynamical and thermal arguments fix its density in a range between @xmath3 and @xmath4 cm @xmath5 at the lmc distance from the galactic center ( but kaufmann et al .",
    "2009 suggest a value ten times higher ) .",
    "@xcite have performed a detailed analysis of the lmc global star formation rate using asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "they find an irregular and patchy distribution in age , with the youngest carbon - rich systems located at the south - east of the disk .",
    "the present star formation activity is rather clumpy and concentrated in stellar complexes characterized by intense hii emission and associated with bright h@xmath0 filamentary bubbles .",
    "most of these very young structures lie on the south - east of the disk , in the proximity of 30 doradus , the largest star forming region of the lmc , some are located in the bar and the remainder form an asymmetric pattern that covers the entire disk with no apparent relation to the global geometry of the satellite .",
    "it is not clear which is the overall physical mechanism responsible for triggering star formation with the observed asymmetric pattern and different models have been proposed in the past .",
    "the stochastic self - propagating star formation ( sspsf ) model predicts a clear age gradient in the lmc s stellar complexes , with the edges being younger with respect to the center , in contradiction with observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario where the bow shock originated by the motion of the lmc through the hot galactic halo compresses the leading edge of the disk and induces star formation .",
    "the pressure at the south - eastern edge of the lmc is indeed 10 times higher than the average in the rest of the lmc @xcite .",
    "this model , which assumes the orbital motion vector lying in the plane of the disk , predicts increasing ages of the stellar complexes in the direction of the rotation , due to the fact that the material compressed at the front side of the disk moves , in time , away to the side .",
    "the youngest systems would indeed lie at the south - east border of the disk , where the relative velocity between the corotating interstellar medium and the external diffuse gas is maximum .",
    "several giant structures along the outer east and north edge of the lmc actually show a progression in age in a clockwise direction : moving from south - east to the north lmc 2 , 30 doradus and lmc 3 , lmc 4 , ngc1818 .",
    "in particular the difference in age between 30 doradus and lmc4 is exactly their distance along the border of the disk divided by the satellite s rotational velocity ( harris , private communication ) .",
    "studied the recent star formation history of the lmc using cepheids and other supergiant stars and found that although the majority of the star formation events in the last 30 myr are concentrated on the east border , others are distributed across the entire disk in partial contrast with the bow shock induced star formation model , that can not explain them .",
    "in this work we use high resolution sph simulations to study the effects of the interaction between the lmc interstellar medium and the diffuse hot halo of the mw .",
    "we want to investigate whether the ram - pressure acting on the leading edge of the lmc disk is responsible for the increase in density observed in the south - east and for triggering star formation .",
    "the analytic model of @xcite assumes a pure edge - on model , but according to @xcite the present angle between the lmc disk and the orbital motion is nearly @xmath6 . even in the absence of precession and nutation , this angle is subjected to large variations during the orbital period in such a way that compression produced by the external hot gas can affect in time both edge - on and face - on .    moreover , the ram - pressure felt by the lmc is not constant and has a maximum when the satellite approaches the perigalacticon .",
    "the motion of the lmc through the hot halo of the mw during the last 1 gyr is modeled using `` test wind tunnel '' simulations with increasing ram - pressure values .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the models and the star formation criteria adopted , section 3 illustrates the results of simulations without star formation , focussed on the investigation of pure effects of compression on the lmc interstellar medium while section 4 describes the runs where star formation is activated .",
    "several simulations have been performed , assuming different star formation models , disk inclinations and hot halo densities .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulations are constructed using the technique described by @xcite .",
    "our disk galaxy model is a multi - component system with a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a spherical nfw @xcite dark matter halo .",
    "the density profile of the dark matter halo is adiabatically contracted in response to baryonic infall @xcite .",
    "the stellar disk follows an exponential surface density profile of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the disk mass and radial scale length ( in cylindrical coordinates ) , respectively , while the thin vertical structure has a scale length @xmath10 : @xmath11 the gaseous disk is characterized by an exponential profile with the same radial and vertical scale length as the stellar component and by a constant density layer which extends up to 8@xmath9 .",
    "the structural parameters of the disk and the halo are chosen so that the resulting rotation curve resembles that of a typical bulgeless late - type ( sc / sd ) disk galaxy .",
    "they are similar to those adopted in m05 for the initial lmc model and reproduce quite well the peak of the rotation curve inferred by @xcite ( fig .",
    "as seen in m05 , the interaction with the mw does not affect significantly the stellar and dark matter mass in the inner @xmath12 kpc of the lmc and consequently the global rotation curve within this radial range .",
    "the choice of an extended gaseous component for the initial lmc model is motivated by the fact that spiral galaxies in the local universe are commonly observed to be embedded in extended disks of neutral hydrogen significantly larger than their stellar component . as seen in m05 ,",
    "the combined effect of tidal interactions and ram - pressure stripping can remove a significant fraction of gas from a lmc disk orbiting within the hot halo of the mw , with a ram - pressure stripping radius which is a factor of three smaller than the initial radius of the gaseous disk .",
    "also in the case of a lmc with orbital velocities significantly higher @xcite hydrodynamic and gravitational forces together are effective in resizing and reshaping the extended gaseous disk of the satellite beyond 8 kpc . in the present work we neglect the presence of gravitational forces focusing on the effects of pure ram - pressure .",
    "therefore we do not expect to see a significant decrease in the radius of the gas distribution .",
    "however , in order to take in account the loss of cold gas from the disk of the satellite and the star formation events , we assumed an initial amount of gas in the disk which is about @xmath13 times larger than the hi mass in the lmc ( @xmath14 @xmath15 according to putman et al .",

    "in particular the toomre s parameter for the stellar disk :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath39 is the local epicyclic frequency and @xmath40 the unperturbed stellar surface density , has a minimum at the disk scale length with @xmath41 . for a gaseous disk the stability of the disk",
    "is expressed in terms of the gas sound speed @xmath42 and surface density @xmath43 through the relation : @xmath44 the gaseous disk has initially a constant temperature of 10000 k , which implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    according to and @xcite , the stability of a multicomponent disk",
