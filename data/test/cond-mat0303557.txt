    "the basics of the density matrix renormalization group were developed by s. white in 1992@xcite and since then dmrg has proved to be a very powerful method for low dimensional interacting systems . its remarkable accuracy can be seen for example in the spin-1 heisenberg chain : for a system of hundreds of sites a precision of @xmath0 for the ground state energy can be achieved . since then it has been applied to a great variety of systems and problems including , among others , spin chains and ladders , fermionic and bosonic systems , disordered models , impurities and molecules and 2d electrons in high magnetic fields .",
    "it has also been improved substantially in several directions like two ( and three ) dimensional ( 2d ) classical systems , stochastic models , the presence of phonons , quantum chemistry , field theory , the inclusion of temperature and the calculation of dynamical and time - dependent properties .",
    "some calculations have also been performed in 2d quantum systems .",
    "all these topics are treated in detail and in a pedagogical way in the book @xcite , where the reader can find an extensive review on dmrg . in this article",
    "we will attempt to cover the different areas where it has been applied without entering into details but in a few cases , where we have chosen some representative contributions .",
    "we suggest the interested reader to look for further information in the referenced work .",
    "our aim here is to give the reader a general overview on the subject .",
    "one of the most important limitations of numerical calculations in finite systems is the great amount of states that have to be considered and its exponential growth with system size .",
    "several methods have been introduced in order to reduce the size of the hilbert space to be able to reach larger systems , such as monte carlo , renormalization group ( rg ) and dmrg .",
    "each method considers a particular criterion of keeping the relevant information .",
    "the dmrg was originally developed to overcome the problems that arise in interacting systems in 1d when standard rg procedures were applied .",
    "consider a block b ( a block is a collection of sites ) where the hamiltonian @xmath1 and end - operators are defined .",
    "these traditional methods consist in putting together two or more blocks ( e.g. b - b , which we will call the superblock ) , connected using end - operators , in a basis that is a direct product of the basis of each block , forming @xmath2 .",
    "this hamiltonian is then diagonalized , the superblock is replaced by a new effective block @xmath3 formed by a certain number @xmath4 of lowest - lying eigenstates of @xmath2 and the iteration is continued ( see ref .",
    "although it has been used successfully in certain cases , this procedure , or similar versions of it , has been applied to several interacting systems with poor performance .",
    "for example , it has been applied to the 1d hubbard model keeping @xmath5 states . for 16 sites , an error of 5 - 10%",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "other results@xcite were also discouraging .",
    "a better performance was obtained @xcite by adding a single site at a time rather than doubling the block size .",
    "however , there is one case where a similar version of this method applies very well : the kondo ( and anderson ) model .",
    "wilson@xcite mapped the one - impurity problem onto a one - dimensional lattice with exponentially descreasing hoppings .",
    "the difference with the method explained above is that in this case , one site ( equivalent to an  onion shell \" ) is added at each step and , due to the exponential decrease of the hopping , very accurate results can be obtained .",
    "returning to the problem of putting several blocks together , the main source of error comes from the election of eigenstates of @xmath2 as representative states of a superblock .",
    "since @xmath2 has no connection to the rest of the lattice , its eigenstates may have unwanted features ( like nodes ) at the ends of the block and this ca nt be improved by increasing the number of states kept .",
    "based on this consideration , noack and white@xcite tried including different boundary conditions and boundary strengths .",
    "this turned out to work well for single particle and anderson localization problems but , however , it did not improve the results significantly for interacting systems .",
    "these considerations led to the idea of taking a larger superblock that includes the blocks @xmath6 , diagonalize the hamiltonian in this large superblock and then somehow project the most favorable states onto @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath3 . in this way ,",
    "awkward features in the boundary would vanish and a better representation of the states in the infinite system would be achieved .",
    "white@xcite proposed the density matrix as the optimal way of projecting the best states onto part of the system and this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "some considerations concerning the effect of boundary conditions in the nature of the states kept ( and an analogy to the physics of black holes ) is given in @xcite .",
    "the justification of using the density matrix is given in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "a very easy and pedagogical way of understanding the basic functioning of dmrg is applying it to the calculation of simple quantum problems like one particle in a tight binding chain @xcite .    in the following section we will briefly describe the standard method ; in sect .",
    "3 we will mention some of the most important applications ; in sect .",
    "4 we review the most relevant extensions to the method and finally in sect .",
    "5 we concentrate on the way dynamical calculations can be performed within dmrg .",
    "the dmrg allows for a systematic truncation of the hilbert space by keeping the most probable states describing a wave function ( _ e.g .  _",
    "the ground state ) instead of the lowest energy states usually kept in previous real space renormalization techniques .",
    "the basic idea consists in starting from a small system ( _ e.g _ with @xmath7 sites ) and then gradually increase its size ( to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ... ) until the desired length is reached .",
    "let us call the collection of @xmath7 sites the _ universe _ and divide it into two parts : the _ system _ and the _ environment _ ( see fig .",
    "[ figsuperblock ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is constructed in the _ universe _ and its ground state @xmath10 is obtained .",
    "this is considered as the state of the _ universe _ and called the _",
    "target state_. it has components on the _ system _ and the _ environment_. we want to obtain the most relevant states of the _ system _ , i.e. , the states of the _ system _ that have largest weight in @xmath11 . to obtain this ,",
    "the _ environment _ is considered as a statistical bath and the density matrix@xcite is used to obtain the desired information on the _",
    "system_. so instead of keeping eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the block ( _ system _ ) , we keep eigenstates of the density matrix . we will be more explicit below .",
    "= 2.0 in = 1.0 in    [ figsuperblock ]    let s define block [ * b * ] as a finite chain with @xmath12 sites , having an associated hilbert space with , @xmath4 states where operators are defined ( in particular the hamiltonian in this finite chain , @xmath1 and the operators at the ends of the block , useful for linking it to other chains or added sites ) .",
    "except for the first iteration , the basis in this block is nt explicitly known due to previous basis rotations and reductions .",
    "the operators in this basis are matrices and the basis states are characterized by quantum numbers ( like @xmath13 , charge or number of particles , etc ) .",
    "we also define an added block or site as [ * a * ] having @xmath14 states .",
    "a general iteration of the method is described below :    \\i ) define the hamiltonian @xmath2 for the superblock ( the _ universe _ ) formed by putting together two blocks [ * b * ] and [ * b * ] and two added sites [ * a * ] and [ * a * ] in this way : [ * b a a b * ] ( the primes are only to indicate additional blocks , but the primed blocks have the same structure as the non - primed ones ; this can vary , see the finite - size algorithm below ) . in general , blocks",
    "[ * b * ] and [ * b * ] come from the previous iteration .",
    "the total hilbert space of this superblock is the direct product of the individual spaces corresponding to each block and the added sites . in practice",
    "a quantum number of the superblock can be fixed ( in a spin chain for example one can look at the total @xmath15 subspace ) , so the total number of states in the superblock is much smaller than @xmath16 . in some cases ,",
    "as the quantum number of the superblock consists of the sum of the quantum numbers of the individual blocks , each block must contain several subspaces ( several values of @xmath13 for example ) .",
    "here periodic boundary conditions can be attached to the ends and a different block layout should be considered ( e.g. [ * b a b a * ] ) to avoid connecting blocks [ * b * ] and [ * b * ] which takes longer to converge .",
    "the boundary conditions are between [ * a * ] and [ * b * ] . for closed chains",
    "the performance is poorer than for open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath2 to obtain the ground state @xmath11 ( target state ) using lanczos@xcite or davidson@xcite algorithms .",
    "other states could also be kept , such as the first excited ones : they are all called _ target states_.",

    "the density matrix considers the part [ * b a * ] as a system and [ * b a * ] , as a statistical bath .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath21 with the highest eigenvalues correspond to the most probable states ( or equivalently the states with highest weight ) of block [ * b a * ] in the ground state of the whole superblock .",
    "these states are kept up to a certain cutoff , keeping a total of @xmath4 states per block .",

    "this block [ * b a * ] is then renamed as block [ * b@xmath23 * ] or simply [ * b * ] ( for example , the hamiltonian in block [ * b a * ] , @xmath24 , is transformed into @xmath25 as @xmath26 ) .",
    "\\v ) a new block [ * a * ] is added ( one site in our case ) and the new superblock [ * b a a b * ] is formed as the direct product of the states of all the blocks .",

    "the length is @xmath27 ( if [ * a * ] consists of one site ) .    when more than one target state is used , _",
    "i.e _ more than one state is wished to be well described , the density matrix is defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 defines the probability of finding the system in the target state @xmath30 ( not necessarily eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "the method described above is usually called the _ infinite - system algorithm _ since the system size increases at each iteration .",
    "there is a way to increase precision at each length @xmath7 called the _ finite - system algorithm_. it consists of fixing the lattice size and zipping a couple of times until convergence is reached . in this case and for the block configuration [ * b a a b * ] , @xmath31 where @xmath12 and @xmath32 are the number of sites in @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . in this step",
    "the density matrix is used to project onto the left @xmath35 sites . in order to keep @xmath7",
    "fixed , in the next block configuration , the right block @xmath34 should be defined in @xmath36 sites such that @xmath37 .",
    "the operators in this smaller block should be kept from previous iterations ( in some cases from the iterations for the system size with @xmath38)@xcite .",
    "the calculation of static properties like correlation functions is easily done by keeping the operators in question at each step and performing the corresponding basis change and reduction , in a similar manner as done with the hamiltonian in each block@xcite .",
    "the energy and measurements are calculated in the superblock . in ref.@xcite",
    "an interpretation of the correlation functions of systems at criticality is given in terms of wave function entanglement , conjecturing a modification of dmrg for these cases that preserves the entanglement .",

    "an interesting analysis on dmrg accuracy is done in ref .",

    ".      there have been several applications to molecules and polymers , such as the pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) hamiltonian for a cyclic polyene@xcite ( where long - range interactions are included ) , magnetic keplerate molecules @xcite , molecular iron rings@xcite and polyacenes considering long range interactions @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to conjugated organic systems ( polymers ) , adapting the dmrg to take into account the most important symmetries in order to obtain the desired excited states@xcite . also conjugated one - dimensional semiconductors @xcite have been studied , in which the standard approach can be extended to complex 1d oligomers where the fundamental repeat is not just one or two atoms , but a complex molecular building block .",
    "relatively new fields of application are the calculation of dynamical properties in the rubinstein - duke model for reptons @xcite and excitons in dendrimer molecules@xcite .",
    "recent attempts to apply dmrg to the _ ab initio _ calculation of electronic states in molecules have been successful@xcite . here , dmrg is applied within the conventional quantum chemical framework of a finite basis set with non - orthogonal basis functions centered on each atom .",
    "after the standard hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation in which a hamiltonian is produced within the orthogonal hf basis , dmrg is used to include correlations beyond hf , where each orbital is treated as a  site \" in a 1d lattice .",
    "one important difference with standard dmrg is that , as the interactions are long - ranged , several operators must be kept , making the calculation somewhat cumbersome .",
    "however , very accurate results have been obtained in a check performed in a water molecule ( keeping up to 25 orbitals and @xmath66 states per block ) , obtaining an offset of 0.00024hartrees with respect to the exact ground state energy@xcite , a better performance than any other approximate method@xcite .    in order to avoid the non - locality introduced in the treatment explained above , white introduced the concept of _ orthlets _ , local , orthogonal and compact wave functions that allow prior knowledge about singularities to be incorporated into the basis and an adequate resolution for the cores@xcite .",
    "the most relevant functions in this basis are chosen via the density matrix .",
    "an application based on the combination with the momentum version of dmrg is used in @xcite to calculate the ground state of several molecules .",
    "the dmrg was originally developed to calculate static ground state properties and low - lying energies .",
    "however , it can also be useful to calculate dynamical response functions .",
    "these are of great interest in condensed matter physics in connection with experiments such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , neutron scattering , optical absorption , photoemission , etc .",
    "we will describe three different methods in this section .",
    "a recent development for calculating response functions in single impurity systems in the presence of a magnetic field was done in @xcite by using the dmrg within wilson s nrg to obtain the green s function .",
    "an interesting extension of dmrg to tackle time - dependent quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium was considered by cazalilla and marston@xcite .",
    "an effective way of extending the basic ideas of this method to the calculation of dynamical quantities is described in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to notice here that due to the particular real - space construction , it is not possible to fix the momentum as a quantum number .",
    "however , we will show that by keeping the appropriate target states , a good value of momentum can be obtained .",
    "we want to calculate the following dynamical correlation function at @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the hermitean conjugate of the operator @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the heisenberg representation of @xmath70 , and @xmath72 is the ground state of the system .",
    "its fourier transform is : @xmath73 where the summation is taken over all the eigenstates @xmath74 of the hamiltonian @xmath75 with energy @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the ground state energy .    defining the green s function @xmath78",
    "the correlation function @xmath79 can be obtained as @xmath80    the function @xmath81 can be written in the form of a continued fraction : @xmath82 the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be obtained using the following recursion equations @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86    for finite systems the green s function @xmath87 has a finite number of poles so only a certain number of coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 have to be calculated .",
    "the dmrg technique presents a good framework to calculate such quantities . with it , the ground state , hamiltonian and the operator @xmath70 required for the evaluation of @xmath79",
    "are obtained .",
    "an important requirement is that the reduced hilbert space should also describe with great precision the relevant excited states @xmath88 .",
    "this is achieved by choosing the appropriate target states . for most systems",
    "it is enough to consider as target states the ground state @xmath11 and the first few @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 as described above . in doing so",
    ", states in the reduced hilbert space relevant to the excited states connected to the ground state via the operator of interest @xmath70 are included .",

    "the dispersion of this spin - wave branch is @xmath95 . above this lower boundary",
    "there exists a two - parameter continuum of excited triplet states that have been calculated using the bethe ansatz approach @xcite with an upper boundary given by @xmath96 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , however , that there are excitations above this upper boundary due to higher order scattering processes , with a weight that is at least one order of magnitude lower than the spin - wave continuum .    in fig .",

    "minor differences arise at @xmath105 .",
    "this is another indication that only the first @xmath106 are relevant for the low energy dynamical properties for finite systems .    in the inset of fig .",
    "3 the spectrum for @xmath99 and @xmath107 is shown .",
    "for this case we considered 5 target states _",
    "i. e.  _ @xmath11 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath100 . here ,",
    "and for all the cases considered , we have verified that the results are very weakly dependent on the weights @xmath29 of the target states ( see eq.([eq : pl ] ) ) as long as the appropriate target states are chosen . for lengths where",
    "this value of @xmath57 is not defined we took the nearest value .",
    "= 3.3 in = 2.75 in    even though we are including states with a given momentum as target states , due to the particular real - space construction of the reduced hilbert space , this translational symmetry is not fulfilled and the momentum is not fixed .",
    "to check how the reduction on the hilbert space influences the momentum @xmath57 of the target state @xmath110 , we calculated the expectation values @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .",

    "the @xmath117-axis has been shifted by .003 so as to have well - defined logarithms .",
    "we can see here that the momentum is better defined , even for much larger systems , but , as expected , more weight on other @xmath112 values arises for larger @xmath7 .    as a check of the approximation we calculated the sum rule @xmath118 for @xmath107 , 5 target states and @xmath100 .",
    "we obtain a relative error of 0.86% .    recently , important improvements to this method have been published @xcite : by considering the finite system method in open chains , khner and white obtained a higher precision in dynamical responses of spin chains . in order to define a momentum in an open chain and to avoid end effects ,",
    "they introduce a filter function with weight centered in the middle of the chain and zero at the boundaries .",
    "recent applications of this method include the calculation of excitations in spin - orbital models ( su(4 ) ) in a magnetic field@xcite , spin dynamics in models for cuprate spin ladders including cyclic spin exchange@xcite , optical conductivity of the ionic hubbard model@xcite , excitations in the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model@xcite and the optical response in 1d mott insulators@xcite .    in this section",
    "we have presented a method of calculating dynamical responses with dmrg .",
    "although the basis truncation is big , this method keeps only the most relevant states and , for example , even by considering a @xmath119 of the total hilbert space ( for @xmath107 only @xmath120 40000 states are kept ) a reasonable description of the low energy excitations is obtained .",
    "we show that it is also possible to obtain states with well defined momenta if the appropriate target states are used .      introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in the dmrg context and improved in ref .",
    "@xcite , this method focuses on a particular energy or energy window , allowing a more precise description in that range and the possibility of calculating spectra for higher energies . instead of using the tridiagonalization of the hamiltonian , but in a similar spirit regarding the important target states to be kept , the spectrum can be calculated for a given @xmath121 by using a correction vector ( related to the operator @xmath70 that can depend on momentum @xmath57 ) .",
    "following ( [ eq : din ] ) , the ( complex ) correction vector @xmath122 can be defined as : @xmath123 so the green s function can be calculated as @xmath124    separating the correction vector in real and imaginary parts @xmath125 we obtain @xmath126 and @xmath127 the former equation is solved using the conjugate gradient method . in order to keep the information of the excitations at this particular energy the following states are targeted in the dmrg iterations : the ground state @xmath128 , the first lanczos vector @xmath129 and the correction vector @xmath122 . even though only a certain energy is focused on",
    ", dmrg gives the correct excitations for an energy range surrounding this particular point so that by running several times for nearby frequencies , an approximate spectrum can be obtained for a wider region @xcite .",
    "a variational formulation of the correction vector technique which leads to more accurate excited energies and spectral weights has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to calculate the optical conductivity of mott insulators@xcite .",
    "this method@xcite relies on a moment expansion of the dynamical correlations using sum rules that depend only on static correlation functions which can be calculated with dmrg . with these moments",
    ", the green s functions can be calculated using the maximum entropy method .",
    "the first step is the calculation of sum rules . as an example , and following @xcite , the spin - spin correlation function @xmath130 of the heisenberg model is calculated where the operator @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ca ] ) is @xmath131 and the sum rules are@xcite : @xmath132,s^z(-q ) ] \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2[1-\\cos(q)]\\sum_i\\langle s^+_{i}s^-_{i+1}+s^-_{i}s^+_{i+1}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the static susceptibility .",
    "these sum rules can be easily generalized to higher moments : @xmath134 ... ],s^z(-q)]\\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath12 odd .",
    "a similar expression is obtained for @xmath12 even , where the outer square bracket is replaced by an anticommutator and the total sign is changed . here",
    "@xmath75 appears in the commutator @xmath135 times .",
    "apart from the first moment which is given by the static susceptibility , all the other moments can be expressed as equal time correlations ( using a symbolic manipulator ) .",
    "the static susceptibility @xmath136 is calculated by applying a small field @xmath137 and calculating the density response @xmath138 with dmrg .",
    "then @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "these moments are calculated for several chain lengths and extrapolated to the infinite system .",
    "once the moments are calculated , the final spectra is constructed via the maximum entropy method ( me ) , which has become a standard way to extract maximum information from incomplete data ( for details see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "reasonable spectra are obtained for the xy and isotropic models , although information about the exact position of the gaps has to be included .",
    "otherwise , the spectra are only qualitatively correct .",
    "this method requires the calculation of a large amount of moments in order to get good results : the more information given to the me equations , the better the result .      in order to include temperature in the calculation of dynamical quantities , the transfer matrix rg described above ( tmrg@xcite )",
    "was extended to obtain imaginary time correlation functions@xcite .",
    "after fourier transformation in the imaginary time axis , analytic continuation from imaginary to real frequencies is done using maximum entropy ( me ) .",
    "the combination of the tmrg and me is free from statistical errors and the negative sign problem of monte carlo methods .",
    "since we are dealing with the transfer matrix , the thermodynamic limit can be discussed directly without extrapolations . however , in the present scheme , only local quantities can be calculated .",
    "a systematic investigation of local spectral functions is done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "the authors obtain good qualitative results especially for high temperatures but a quantitative description of peaks and gaps are beyond the method , due to the severe intrinsic limitation of the analytic continuation .",
    "this method was also applied with great success to the 1d kondo insulator@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the local density of states and local dynamic spin and charge correlation functions were calculated .",
    "we have presented here a very brief description of the density matrix renormalization group technique , its applications and extensions .",

    "<S> the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) has become a powerful numerical method that can be applied to low - dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> it allows for a very precise calculation of static , dynamical and thermodynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> its field of applicability has now extended beyond condensed matter , and is successfully used in statistical mechanics and high energy physics as well . in this article , we briefly review the main aspects of the method . we also comment on some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview on the scope and possibilities of dmrg and mention the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties , the application to classical systems , inclusion of temperature , phonons and disorder , field theory , time - dependent properties and the _ ab initio _ calculation of electronic states in molecules .    </S>"
