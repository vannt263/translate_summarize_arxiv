    "molecular dynamics simulations on large computers have become one of the mainstays for investigating the functions of biomolecules . using statistical algorithms ,",
    "they create a large number of snapshots of the molecule that approximate the expected distribution of molecular shapes in actual molecular processes . by looking for typical shapes ( conformations ) and transition paths in this large data set",
    ", biochemists can learn about the molecular bases of biochemical processes .",
    "such understanding is important in particular in designing more efficient medical drugs .",
    "identifying typical shapes in such a large data set is itself a difficult task @xcite . in most simulation ,",
    "one focuses on a few characteristic numbers , like the angles or distances between specific atoms in the molecule , and monitors the change of these quantities in the simulation .",
    "this approach requires some advance knowledge about which parts of the molecule are important to the dynamics , and makes it also difficult to perform the analysis automatically .    to use all the information computed in a molecular dynamics simulation",
    ", one must leave the analysis step again to a computer .",
    "we present here two procedures to aid in this task : a projection method to visualize the molecular configurations of a trajectory as a point set in the plane , and a cluster analysis to identify clusters of similar configurations in the trajectory .",
    "these methods can be applied automatically to any molecular dynamics trajectory and result in a tentative identification of conformations in the trajectory .",
    "the output of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory , i.e.  sequence of configurations that depicts the evolution of the molecule in time .",
    "if the molecule consists of @xmath0 atoms , the configuration @xmath1 is described by @xmath0 3-dimensional vectors @xmath2 that specify the cartesian position of each atom in 3-dimensional space .",
    "other information , in particular which atoms are connected by chemical bonds , is a property of the molecule and usually does not change during the simulation .    to classify the configurations",
    ", we must quantify how much their geometries differ .",
    "we thus assign to each configuration a feature vector that describes the geometry of the configuration is such a way that similar configurations have similar feature vectors . however , the set of @xmath3 numbers that make up the cartesian positions of the atoms is unsuited as identical geometries can appear with different rotations and translations . while the translational freedom can easily be fixed by requiring that the center of mass conincides with the origin of the coordinate frame , the rotational degree of freedom is extremely difficult to eliminate .",
    "fixing the axis of inertia can lead to sudden articifical rotations when the axes become degenerate , while fixing certain atoms to the coordinate axes always introduces a undesirable bias .",
    "a feature vector that is invariant under translations and rotations and does not introduce any bias can be chosen by considering the set of intramolecular distances @xcite [ eq6 ] \\ { d_ij(x )",
    "= |*x*_i - * x*_j| , i , j1,  ,n } .",
    "the price to pay is that instead of @xmath3 elements , this vector has now @xmath4 , but geometrically identical configurations have identical feature vectors , and the cartesian distance in @xmath4-dimensional space is a natural measure of conformational distance : [ eq5 ] d(x , y ) = .",
    "another frequent way to choose a feature vector is to use the dihedral angles between certain atoms as basic degrees of freedom .",
    "this is a natural choice as dihedral angles are the main degrees of motion in the simulations ( atomic distances and bond angles are usually much more rigid ) .",
    "however , the potential energy that determines the dynamics of the molecule depends on the spatial distance of the atoms , and the relation between dihedral angles and spatial distances is involved at best .",
    "we prefer here to put all information as unbiased as possible to the algorithm and depend on it to extract the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the feature vector ( [ eq6 ] ) is vast compared to the number of degrees of freedom ( in our example molecule , it has 2415 elements as compared to @xmath5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "some of its elements will show little or no fluctuation ( e.g.  the ones associated to the lengths of chemical bonds ) , others will fluctuate thermally , and still others will assume different values in different fluctuations and thus exhibit a double - peaked distribution . to reduce the thermal noise",
    ", we analyze the elements of the feature vector statistically and select those whose distribution has the largest width . as thermal fluctuations are smaller than the conformational changes , this also selects the distances most affected by conformational changes .",
    "a similar procedure has been used by @xcite to identify essential degrees of freedom in cartesian coordinate space .",
    "the feature vector space is by far too large to be visualized directly . to capture the major properties of the point",
    "set that represents a trajectory in this space , we seek to visualize it in a plane , i.e. to assign each configuration a point in the two - dimensional plane such that the geometrical similarity between configurations is reproduced as faithfully as possible .",
    "after having chosen a distance measure ( [ eq5 ] ) on the trajectory , this reduces to the general problem of visualizing an arbitrary distance matrix @xmath6 between a set of @xmath7 configurations , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 now number configurations .",
    "one choice is to require that the mean quadratic deviation of the conformational distance from the distance in the plane , given by [ eq2 ] d^2 = _",
    "i > j ( |*x*_i - * x*_j| - d_ij ) is minimized by the choice of the points @xmath10 , i.e.  that the derivative of the quantity with respect to the position of the @xmath11-th point [ eq3 ] = _ i ( |*x*_k - * x*_i| - d_ik ) = 0 vanishes .",
    "this equation can be pictured physically by a set of springs that connect the points and whose natural length is given by the desired distance between the points .",
    "we solve the minimum problem of ( [ eq2 ] ) numerically by the conjugate - gradient method .",
    "though there is no guarantee that the minimum found by this method is the global one , the minimization takes place in a @xmath12-dimensional space where it is improbable that a false minimum is stable in all directions .",
    "an example of this is the situation where we have a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) in @xmath13 dimensions and then extend the solution space to @xmath14 dimensions by setting @xmath15 for all @xmath8 , which still satifies eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "however , this minimum ( in @xmath13 dimensions ) now turns out to be a saddle point in @xmath14 dimensions , where the second derivative of @xmath16 is = \\ {    cl & + -_ik    . in a true minimum ,",
    "this quantity is positive , thus requiring that d_kl    inequality is an equality , i.e.  if the solution is complete .",
    "another widely used low - dimensional approximation is based on the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the feature matrix @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the feature matrix of @xmath18 objects with @xmath19 features each .",
    "( in our example , @xmath0 is the number of configurations while @xmath20 is the number of intramolecular distances . )",
    "the singular - value decomposition expresses this matrix as a series @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath0- and @xmath20-dimensional , resp .",
    ", orthonormalized basis vectors , and @xmath24 gives the weight of @xmath11-th term .",
    "the number of terms in the series is the rank of the matrix , it is at most the lower of @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "the relation between singular - value decomposition and point sets in low - dimensional space can be seen by calculating the distance between feature vectors in terms of the svd : @xmath25 when orthonormality of @xmath26 is taken into account .",
    "thus the vectors \\ { _ k u^(k)_i : k=1,  ,m } can be interpreted as specifying the cartesian positions in @xmath20-dimensional space of the @xmath8-th data point .",
    "when we chose @xmath24 in decreasing order , truncating the series after singular - value decomposition after @xmath27 terms will lead position vectors in @xmath27-dimensional space that are best approximations in a linear sense .",
    "the major difference between the two approaches is that the svd performs the approximation is a linear manner : when the dimension of the approximation space is decreased from @xmath14 to @xmath13 , the new approximation is simply obtained by orthogonally projecting out the last coordinate .",
    "in contrast , in the approximation obtained from minimizing ( [ eq2 ] ) , the nonlinearity introduced by the square root redistributes some of the `` lost '' distance in the remaining dimensions .",
    "cluster analysis @xcite is a statistical method to partition the point set into disjoint subsets with the property that the points in a subset are in some sense closer to each other than to the remaining points .",
    "there are several different ways to make this statement mathematically precise .",
    "we choose the notion of minimum residual similarity between clusters which leads to a natural formulation of the problem in terms of eigensystem analysis and to a heuristic algorithm for its solution .",
    "this spectral method goes back to works by donath and hoffmann @xcite on graph partitioning in computer logic and fiedler @xcite on acyclic graphs and was later picked up by hendrickson @xcite .",
    "other cluster analysis methods based on neural networks or fuzzy clustering have also been applied to molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "amadei _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite went further by introducing the concept of essential dynamics in which the coordinate space of the molecule is split into a small essential subspace and a larger non - essential subspace .",
    "they assumed a linear factorization of the coordinate space and identified essential coordinates by large second moments of their distribution , assuming that these distributions are mainly non - gaussian double - peaked shapes .    to be as flexible as possible",
    ", we assume that a similarity measure 0 a_ij 1 , 1i n is given between the @xmath0 data points , where @xmath28 indicates complete dissimilarity and @xmath29 complete identity of configurations @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the residual similarity of a cluster @xmath30 characterizes how similar elements of the cluster are to elements outside the cluster r(c ) = _ ic , jc a_ij .",
    "we wish to partition the data set into two subsets such that this quantity is minimized .",
    "let @xmath31 the characteristic vector of this partition , with value @xmath32 indicating that @xmath33 , and otherwise @xmath34 .",
    "then the residual similarity can be rewritten [ eq4 ] r(c ) & = & _ ij ( a_i - a_j)^2 a_ij + & = & _ ij a_i ( _ k a_ik _ ij - a_ij ) a_j + & = & ( a , ma ) with the laplacian matrix m_ij = \\",
    "{    cl -a_ij & + _ k a_ik &    . .",
    "to find the minimum of the expectation value @xmath35 over the vectors that have element @xmath36 only , is a hard combinatorial problem .",
    "however , if we relax the problem and allow real values for the @xmath31 with the constraint @xmath37 , the problem is exactly the problem of finding the second - lowest eigenvector of the matrix @xmath38 ( the lowest eigenvector corresponds to the solution @xmath39 that does not lead to a proper partition ) . since eigenvectors are orthogonal , the second - lowest eigenvector satisfies _",
    "i a^2_i = 1 _ i a_i = 0 and thus guarantees that it will contain both positive and negative eigenvalues . in graph theory , this eigenvector",
    "is called the characteristic valuation of a graph .",
    "low - lying eigenvectors of a matrix can be found using iterative methods even for moderately large matrices .",
    "there is , however , no safe way to recover the solution of the combinatorial problem , where @xmath40 is restricted to values of @xmath36 from it , but it can be argued that for most matrices the eigenvector will constitute a good approximation to the combinatorial problem .",
    "we thus map the continuous value @xmath31 to discrete value @xmath41 using a threshold @xmath27 : a_i = \\ {    cl -1 & + + 1 &    . .",
    "the threshold can now be determined by minimizing the residual similarity over all possible thresholds . in this way",
    ", the minimization problem is reduced from @xmath42 to just @xmath0 options , and the characteristic valuation serves as a heuristic to determine the options that are taken into consideration .",
    "the measure of residual similarity favors in general splitting off a single point from the data set since ( [ eq4 ] ) contains in this case only @xmath43 terms , as compared to @xmath44 when splitting symmetrically .",
    "this automatically introduces a quality control in the splits , as central splits occur only when the cluster separation is rather favorable , but might also hinder the analysis of noisy data .",
    "however , the special form ( [ eq4 ] ) was only chosen to turn the problem into an eigenvalue problem .",
    "as the whole procedure is heuristic in nature , we may well decide to use a different similarity measure when determining the splitting threshold , e.g.  a measure that includes a combinatorial factor r(c ) = |_ic , jc a_ij .",
    "which measure is correct depends mainly on the application .",
    "the original measure is stricter in what it returns as a cluster , while the latter measure favors balanced splittings .",
    "in some problems , like partitioning matrices for processing in a parallel computer , one may even demand that each split is symmetrical .",
    "another approach taken frequently in cluster analysis is to use the singular - value decomposition @xcite . if we go back to the feature matrix @xmath45 and its singular value decomposition ( [ eq1 ] ) , it turns out that the vectors @xmath46 correspond to minima of the expectation value with respect to the feature matrix squared , i.e. _ k ( _ i u_i a_ik)^2 = _ ij u_i ( a_i a_j ) u_j where we introduced the row vectors @xmath47 of the matrix @xmath48 , i.e.  the feature vector of data point @xmath8 .",
    "thus in this approach the role of the similarity matrix is taken over by the scalar - product matrix of the feature vectors .",
    "the major differences are +    1 .   the scalar products are not less than or equal to one , but this could easily be fixed by globally rescaling the scalar - product matrix , which does not change the vectors @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   the scalar products can be negative .",
    "the notion of a scalar - product is not of similarity and dissimilarity but rather the trichotomy of similar , orthogonal , and antagonistic .",
    "+    thus , singular - value decomposition seems suitable for feature vectors that characterize orthogonal qualities .",
    "however , this is not the case in our feature vectors , so we chose a similarity measure based upon distance .",
    "after partitioning the data set into two subsets , we proceed to apply the algorithm again to these subsets . in this way , one obtains a splitting tree that terminates only when the subset size is smaller than three . for many applications ,",
    "such a tree is already quite useful as it orders the data points in such a way to similar data points are usually close to each other .    to identify clusters in the splitting tree",
    ", we found that the average width of the cluster relative to that of its parent cluster gives the best indication . to calculate the average width of a cluster we use the euclidean distance in the high - dimensional space and average over all distinct pairs of points in a cluster .",
    "this quantity relative to that of the parent cluster basically indicates how much the closer the points are on average in the subcluster than in the original cluster and thus how much the split improves the cluster criterion .",
    "consider e.g.  the situation where there are three clusters .",
    "the first split will result in one correctly identified cluster and a second pseudo - cluster that encompasses the other two , but the relative width of the true cluster will be much smaller than that of the pseudo - cluster . only after the next split it will be revealed that the latter consists of two clusters .",
    "typical values for this quantity are between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "= .8    = .8    = .4=.4    = .4=.4    = .4=.4    we apply our methods to a molecular dynamics simulation of the molecule _ adenylyl(3-5)cytidylyl(3-5)cytidin _ in vacuum @xcite .",
    "this is a very simple tri - ribonucleotide , consisting of three residues and 70 ( effective ) atoms .",
    "the simulation was performed using the gromos96 @xcite extended atom force field . for the analysis , we chose a subset of 1000 configurations equidistantly from the trajectory .    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the two - dimensional map of the trajectory found by minimizing ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the points are connected by a line in the same sequence as they are generated in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "this information does not enter in determining the locations of the points in the plane , so the fact that the line segments are rather short indicates that point adjacent in the trajectory are mapped to nearby points in the plane and thus are recognized as geometrically similar by the algorithm . the one pair of lines that crosses nearly the whole plane horizontally is actually made up of the first three data points and therefore a transient effect before the molecule became equilibrated .",
    "we immediately notice that there are at least three clearly different groups of points which constitute conformations in a geometrical sense , i.e.  subsets of the trajectory with similar geometrical properties . that they are also dynamical conformations can be seen from the fact that the connecting line of the points only very rarely crosses from one point group into the next .",
    "this again confirms that the two - dimensional layout in the plane chosen by the algorithm represents correctly the dynamics of the system .",
    "the representation of fig .  [ fig1 ] can be compared to a representation where the dimensionality of the system is reduced by chemical understanding .",
    "as the system consists of three residues , most of the conformational dynamics can be assumed to be in the geometrical layout of the residues .",
    "this can be described by only three numbers , and we chose two of them to create the two - dimensional representation shown in fig .",
    "this picture is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in that there appear approximately three distinct point groups , and it can be verified that they correspond to the point groups from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . however , the separation of the point groups is less clear than in fig .",
    "this indicates that the conformational dynamics is not simply the motion of the _ centers _ of the residues , but there are also smaller rearrangements in the residues themselves that are correlated to the large - scale motions . by considering an unbiased measure for geometrical similarity , all those little rearrangements enter and reinforce the distance between conformations in the plane .      applying the cluster algorithm to the similarity matrix of the trajectory ,",
    "the first few splits remove 22 isolated points before the small cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a with 40 points and a relative width of 0.46 ( both compared to its immediate predecessor and to the initial point set ) shows up .",
    "the remaining points are split some steps further into a cluster with 698 points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and another cluster with 230 points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c with relative widths of about 0.53 . after some",
    "more steps , the larger subcluster is broken into three subclusters with 388 , 52 , and 21 points , resp . , and relative widths of 0.91 , 0.73 , and 0.61 , resp .",
    ", as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d , e , and f. similarly , the smaller subcluster also separates into three weak subclusters .",
    "the splitting line of the large cluster at the bottom is also visible in fig .",
    "such a pattern usually indicates that beside a large conformational change that induces the three clearly visible clusters , where the middle cluster is clearly a transitional state , there is another smaller conformational change , possibly in one of the glucose rings , independent of the larger one .",
    "as it only affects a small part of the molecule , the conformational distance is smaller and is then imprinted like a fine structure on the clusters . that such changes are visible in the plot is an advantage from considering all atom coordinates without bias .",
    "we have demonstrated a method for projecting a molecular dynamics trajectory onto a plane to capture the conformational structure of the trajectory .",
    "conformations can in this way be easily identified by visual inspection .",
    "cluster analysis on the full conformational distance matrix also revealed these clusters , but also allowed to discern fine structure inside the clusters caused by smaller conformational changes .    to simplify the analysis of a trajectory , we have created a java application that reads the output files of the combined plane mapping / cluster analysis program and displays the two - dimensional map .",
    "this program interacts directly with an open inventor molecular visualization application by means of a unix pipe .",
    "whenever the user selects a point in the plane , the corresponding configuration is shown in the visualization program .",
    "the user can also choose to display identified clusters using different colors in the map .",
    "identifying which parts of the molecule are responsible for different conformations is a much more difficult problem .",
    "we use a visualization application that allows the user to form groups of atoms that are visualized by ellipsoids . in this way",
    ", a molecule can be easily reduced to its functional groups where it is much easier to spot conformational changes .",
    "however , small conformational changes as those that show up as a fine structure on the plane map are easily lost in this representation .      as a first attempt at aiding the eye in discovering unusual motions of the molecule",
    ", we implemented a simple opengl effect in the visualization application that allows to blend several frames of an animation in the hope that large changes stand out more clearly in this representation .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows one such picture .",
    "certainly more research can be expended on how to identify and visualize the essential degrees of freedoms .",
    "the concept of essential molecular dynamics has been introduced to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the simulation .",
    "both the plane map and the cluster analysis can be used to inflict new coordinates upon the system . for the point map , these are simply the @xmath1 and @xmath51 positions of the configuration in the plane .",
    "once a certain point map has been established , new configurations can be fitted into the plane by minimizing the residual distance while keeping all other points fixed .",
    "similarly , the cluster analysis assigns to each configuration a position in the tree that can be seen as a ( discrete ) essential coordinate .",
    "how such essential coordinates can be reintroduced into the dynamics of the system is still an open question .",
