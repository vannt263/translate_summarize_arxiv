    "the efficiency of these surveys is enhanced as compared with those made in blank fields ( blain 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , follow - up observations are significantly easier in the lensed fields as compared with true blank fields because of the typical magnification , a factor of 2.5 , of the detected sources at all wavelengths ( ivison et al .  1998 , 1999 ; frayer et al .   1998 , 1999 ;",

    "we use the detections of four high - redshift dusty galaxies in the 450-@xmath0 m scuba lens survey data ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) to yield the first galaxy count at a wavelength of 450@xmath0 m .    the relative number counts at different wavelengths depend on the distribution of both the redshifts and dust temperatures of the submm galaxy population .",
    "it is possible to impose more rigorous constraints on the form of evolution of high - redshift dusty galaxies if accurate galaxy counts are available at several submm wavelengths .",
    "recently we published counts of galaxies detected at a wavelength of 850@xmath0 m through the cores of seven massive cluster lenses ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) to a depth of 0.5mjy ( blain et al .  1999 ) .",
    "we used accurate mass models of the foreground lenses , which are constrained using the properties of lensed arcs detected in deep optical images and the spectroscopic redshifts of multiply - imaged background galaxies ( for example kneib et al .",
    "1993 ; bzecourt et al .",
    "1999 ) , to reconstruct the background sky .",
    "the robustness of the method was verified by extensive monte - carlo simulations . here",
    "we apply the same method to the 450-@xmath0 m scuba maps of the seven lensing clusters observed in the survey ; cl0024 + 16 , a370 , ms0440 + 02 , cl0939 + 47/a851 , a1835 , a2390 and cl2244 - 02 .",
    "the data was taken in a range of ( generally exceptional ) atmospheric conditions , and so the thresholds for the detection of a 450-@xmath0 m source vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "the @xmath2 flux density limits for detection are about 60 , 30 , 60 , 20 , 20 , 60 and 60mjy in each cluster respectively .",
    "four sources were detected : one behind a370 ( smmj02399@xmath30136 , the brightest source in the sample , with a 450-@xmath0 m flux density of @xmath4mjy ) ; two behind a1835 ( smmj14009 + 0252 and smmj14011 + 0252 ; ivison et al .  1999 ) ; and one behind cl0939 + 47/a851 ( an extremely red object or ero ",

    "in our earlier analysis of the 17 sources detected in the scuba lens survey to yield 850-@xmath0 m counts , we first removed 2 submm sources identified with cluster cd galaxies from the sample ( edge et al .",
    "we also removed one other submm galaxy from the sample , which was identified with a spiral galaxy in the foreground of the cluster cl0939 + 47/a851 , and identified one further submm galaxy with a spiral galaxy falling into ms0440 + 02 .",
    "we now know that these two scuba detections are more likely to be identified with eros discovered in our deep near - infrared follow - up images ( smail et al .",
    "1999a ) than with the low - redshift spiral galaxies .",
    "here we repeat the earlier analysis of the counts ( blain et al .",

    "the updated 850-@xmath0 m counts that result are shown in table1 and fig.1 .",
    "the new results are within the 1@xmath11 errors of our previous analysis of the 850-@xmath0 m counts , and are modified at only the 10% level if the redshift distribution of the source population is assumed to be given by the results of either barger et al .",
