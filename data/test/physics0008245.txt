    "a goal of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in statistical mechanics @xcite is the calculation of ensemble mean values of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "ensemble mean values are multidimensional integrals over configuration space    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the probability of finding a system in the state defined by @xmath2 , and the functional form of @xmath1 depends on the ensemble investigated .",
    "mc simulations usually generate a sampling of configuration space @xmath3 by the use of a stochastic process with stationary probability @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 evaluated at @xmath6 is the output of the simulation @xmath7 , and its arithmetic mean value @xmath8 , in principle , must approach the ensemble mean value.@xcite in this paper we refer to the set of configurations generated in a monte carlo simulation as a time sequence , and we study the behavior of these temporal sequences @xmath9 and their arithmetic mean , to understand better how mc simulations approach ergodic behavior .",
    "it is important to emphasize that there are two time variables to consider .",
    "the time variable @xmath10 labels the separate configurations generated in a monte carlo walk . variations of properties with @xmath10 provide information about the short - time behavior of a mc simulation .",
    "the time variable @xmath11 labels the total length of the mc walk , and variations of computed properties with @xmath11 provide information about the convergence of the simulation on a long time scale .",
    "given an infinite time , the stochastic walker in a mc simulation visits every allowed point in configuration space.@xcite ergodic behavior is reached when the length of the walk is sufficiently long to sample configuration space appropriately.@xcite in practice , this does not mean that the space has been densely covered but that every region with non - negligible probability has been reached .",
    "in such a case we can say that the simulation is effectively ergodic or that it has reached the ergodic limit .    for a finite walk , in the event of broken ergodicity @xcite ,",
    "phase space is effectively disconnected .",
    "the different disconnected regions ( called components ) are separated by barriers of zero effective probability .",
    "if a stochastic walker starts its walk in one of these regions , it may not cross the barriers within the time of the simulation .",
    "if the simulation length is increased , some barriers may become accessible for the walker and phase space is better sampled .",
    "we can conclude that a time @xmath12 exists such that , for simulation lengths shorter than @xmath12 , the walker becomes trapped in one of the phase space components . for simulation lengths much larger than @xmath12 , phase space",
    "is effectively covered by the walker .    in this study",
    "we imagine a system having more than one time scale @xmath13 . in a monte carlo simulation",
    "each scale comes from stochastic processes with different correlation times.@xcite a precise definition of the correlation times for monte carlo processes is given in section iii , but for the moment we can think of these correlation times as identical to physical time scales of the system under study . to understand these time scales more fully , it is useful to focus on an example .",
    "prototypical of systems having such disparate time scales are atomic and molecular clusters .",
    "typical cluster potential surfaces have many local minima separated by significant energy barriers . @xcite the local minima can be grouped into basins of similar energies , with each basin separated from other basins again by energy barriers . at",
    "short monte carlo times a cluster system executes small amplitude oscillations about one of its potential minima .",
    "we can think of these vibrational time scales as the shortest time scales that define a cluster system . as the simulation time",
    "is extended the system eventually hops between different local minima within the same basin . the time scale for the first hops between local minima can be considered the next shortest time scale for the simulation . at still longer monte carlo times , the system hops between different energy basins defining yet another time scale for the simulation .",
    "this grouping of time scales continues until the longest time scale for a given system is reached . at monte",
    "carlo times that are long compared to this longest time scale , the simulation is ergodic .",
    "consider a system with several time scales as mentioned above . if the length of the simulation is smaller than the smallest correlation time , the walker may become trapped in an effectively disconnected region and the sampling of phase space is incomplete . by increasing the time , the memory of the initial condition in the sampling decreases as the walker crosses to other previously unreachable regions . these oscillations and hoppings can be modeled by a superposition of stochastic processes with different correlation times . these processes with non - zero correlation times",
    "are known as _ colored noise _ processes ( as opposed to zero correlation time _ white noise _ processes ) .",
    "@xcite from the study of the autocorrelation functions of a stochastic model defined using these colored noise processes , we can verify that , at a fixed run length @xmath11 , there exist two different groups of processes ; those that contribute to the autocorrelation function with terms that decay like @xmath14 ( called _ diffusive _ processes ) , and those that contribute to the autocorrelation function with terms that decay slower than @xmath14 ( called _ non - diffusive _ processes ) . when the time of the simulation is increased , some non - diffusive processes at shorter run lengths , start to contribute to the autocorrelation function like diffusive processes . after the walk length reaches the largest correlation time @xmath15 ,",
    "all processes contribute to the autocorrelation function with terms that decay like @xmath14 . at this point ,",
    "the simulation is at the diffusive regime and effective ergodicity has been reached .",
    "a principal goal of this work is to investigate the way in which the mc output @xmath9 reaches the diffusive limit ( i.e. the ergodic limit ) by studying the properties of autocorrelation functions under changes of scale in time , @xmath16 with @xmath17 . by time",
    "scaling it is possible to infer the decay law of the non - diffusive contributions with respect to the total simulation time @xmath11 .",
    "the functional dependence of the non - diffusive contributions on the parameter @xmath18 that is used to scale @xmath11 is determined empirically .",
    "we have found the decay law so determined to be a particularly valuable method of concluding when a simulation can be considered ergodic . unlike previous studies @xcite that only have investigated the behavior of certain autocorrelation functions in the ergodic regime , by focusing on the approach to ergodic behavior we have a more careful monitor of the onset of ergodicity .",
    "once the non - diffusive contributions have decayed to a point where they are too small to be distinguished from zero to within the fluctuations of the calculation , we can say that the ergodic limit has been reached .",
    "the autocorrelation functions we use to measure the approach to the ergodic limit are based on one of the probes of ergodicity developed by thirumalai and co - workers @xcite , and is often called the _ energy metric_. the energy metric has been proposed as an alternative to other techniques @xcite ( like the study of the lyapunov exponents @xcite ) for the study of ergodic properties in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . the metric has been used to study the relative efficiency of mc simulation methods as well .",
    "@xcite the mc metric as used in the current work can easily be extended from the energy to other scalar observables of the system .",
    "we present two key issues in this paper .",
    "first , from the knowledge of the decay law of the non - diffusive contributions to the mc metric , we infer how long a simulation must be to be considered effectively ergodic .",
    "second , once the ergodic limit is reached , we can compare the results from different numerical algorithms to measure relative efficiencies .",
    "because the outcomes of mc simulations are noisy , we have found it useful to separate diffusive and non - diffusive terms in the mc metric with a fourier analysis so that we can neglect the high frequency components of the noise .",
    "this technique has given reproducible results .    to test the match between the stochastic model and actual monte carlo simulations , we examine the approach to ergodic behavior in simulations of lennard - jones clusters . recently @xcite we have studied the thermodynamic properties of lennard - jones clusters as a function of temperature using both j - walking @xcite and parallel tempering methods .",
    "@xcite both simulation techniques require an initial high temperature that must be ergodic when metropolis monte carlo methods @xcite are used .",
    "if the metropolis method does not give ergodic results at the initial high temperature , systematic errors propagate to the lower temperatures in j - walking and parallel tempering simulations , and the results can be flawed or meaningless . in most monte carlo simulations of clusters at finite temperatures , @xcite the clusters are defined by enclosing the atoms within a constraining potential about the center of mass of the system . the constraining potential is necessary because clusters at finite temperatures have finite vapor pressures , and the association of any one atom with the cluster can be ill - defined . from experience @xcite we have found that if the radius of the constraining potential and the initial high temperature are not both carefully chosen , it can be difficult to attain ergodicity with metropolis methods .",
    "a key concern then is the choice of constraining radius and the choice of initial temperature .",
    "we verify the stochastic model by investigating monte carlo simulation results as a function of the temperature and the size of the constraining potential .",
    "the contents of the remainder of this paper are as follows . in section",
    "ii we motivate the studies that follow by examining numerally the behavior of a set of monte carlo simulations of a 13-particle lennard - jones cluster .",
    "this cluster system is used to illustrate the results throughout this paper . in section iii",

    "v we test the discrete stochastic model with applications to lennard - jones clusters and in section vi we summarize our conclusions . many of the key derivations needed for the developments are found in two appendices .",
    "before discussing the major developments of this work , it is useful to understand the nature of the problem we are attempting to solve by examining some numerical results on a prototypical system . we take the 13-particle lennard - jones cluster defined by the potential function    @xmath19 + \\sum_{i=1}^nv_c ( \\vec{x}_i , r_c ) \\label{pot}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the standard lennard - jones energy and length parameters , @xmath22 is the number of particles in the cluster ( 13 in the present case ) , @xmath23 is the distance between particles @xmath24 and @xmath25    @xmath26    and @xmath27 is the constraining potential discussed in sec .",
