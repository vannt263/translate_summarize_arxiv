    "in a recent paper , kiritani _ et al . _ reported that a large number of vacancies were produced during high - speed heavy plastic deformation of thin foils of fcc metals @xcite .",
    "they observed a large density of stacking - fault tetrahedra but very low dislocation densities in the foils after deformation .",
    "as a possible explanation , they propose a dislocation - free deformation mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the deformation processes in metals under very high strain rates .",
    "our approach is that of molecular dynamics ( md ) , where newton s second law is solved numerically for all the atoms in the system under consideration .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that no _ a priori _ assumptions are made about the deformation mechanism .",
    "structures such as dislocations appear automatically from the motion of the atoms .",
    "the simulation thus becomes `` unbiased '' , i.e.  the result is independent of our prior assumptions about the active deformation mechanisms .",
    "we have chosen to simulate the deformation processes in systems that are initially dislocation - free ( i.e. without conventional dislocation sources such as frank - read sources ) .",
    "we start with single crystals in order to avoid dislocation emission from grain boundaries .",
    "simulations of high - speed deformation of polycrystalline ( nanocrystalline ) material have been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although many metals were studied experimentally by kiritani et al.@xcite , we have chosen to focus our simulations on one metal : copper .",
    "in order to get meaningful results from a molecular dynamics simulation , it is essential that the interatomic forces used in the simulation are a good approximation to the forces the atoms would experience in a real physical system with the same atomic configuration .",
    "we use the effective medium theory ( emt ) @xcite to describe the interatomic interactions , as the emt potential for copper has been well tested .",
    "the simulated systems were single crystals .",
    "two different system sizes were used , one with approximately 95000 atoms and one with approximately 765000 atoms .",
    "the linear dimensions of the two systems are approximately 10.5 nm and 21 nm . in both cases",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied to the simulation , so the system effectively becomes an infinite crystal .    in the smaller system",
    "four vacancies were created in the initial configuration , by removing four random atoms .",
    "they were introduced in the unlikely case that vacancies were somehow actively participating in the deformation .",
    "the system is deformed along the [ 521 ] direction at a temperature of 450 k. we have chosen this temperature since we consider it likely that significant local heating is occurring in the experiments due to the high strain rate .    as the preexisting vacancies in the smaller system did not participate in the deformation , no vacancies were introduced in the larger system .",
    "it was deformed along the [ @xmath0 direction at the same temperature .",
    "the systems were deformed at a constant strain rate , while keeping the stress in the transverse direction approximately constant .",
    "this procedure is further described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all cases a strain rate of @xmath1 was used ( compared to approximately @xmath2 in the experiments ) . to keep the temperature of the system approximately constant during the simulation , langevin dynamics @xcite are used , i.e.  a friction and a fluctuating force",
    "are added to the equations of motion of the atoms .",
    "we use a timestep of 5fs , safely below the value where the dynamics becomes unstable .    during the simulations , configurations",
    "were rapidly quenched , and the local crystal structure was identified by common neighbor analysis @xcite .",
    "this was used to generate plots where all atoms except atoms at the dislocation cores were made invisible , allowing the visualization of the dislocation structures .",
    "[ 0pt][0pt ] [ 0pt][0pt ] + [ 0pt][0pt ] [ 0pt][0pt ]    figure [ fig : sysi ] shows the deformation of the smaller system . in figure",
    "[ fig : sysi](b ) the first dislocation activity appears in the form of a few dislocation loops .",
    "the loops are nucleated homogeneously , i.e.  without the presence of dislocation sources or crystal defects . the exact time and position of the nucleation event",
    "is determined by random thermal fluctuations .",
    "the loops are faulted loops consisting of a single partial dislocation with a stacking fault inside the loop .",
    "the loops expand rapidly .",
    "due to the periodic boundary conditions the dislocations can not disappear from the sample .",
    "they will continue to move causing significant plastic deformation .",
    "as the dislocations on different glide planes interact , dislocation reactions occur and a number of triple junctions appear .",
    "these typically consist of two shockley partials that meet to form a stair - rod dislocation .",
    "continuous formation and destruction of these sessile dislocations are seen in the simulations .",
    "the dislocations observed in the simulations are mainly single shockley partials .",
    "the homogeneous dislocation nucleation mechanism makes it very difficult to nucleate the second partial .",
    "dislocations are only nucleated at extremely high stresses , but as soon as the first partial dislocation is created , it locally shields the stress field and prevents the second partial from nucleating .",
    "it probably also plays a role that the stacking fault energy is low . versus 52 mj / m@xmath3 ) .",
    "] at high stresses the energy of the stacking faults become small compared to other energies in the system , such as the energy released by a moving dislocation .",
    "after some dislocation activity has occurred we observe the first creation of vacancies in figure [ fig : sysi](c ) .",
    "a `` sausage - like '' string of vacancies has appeared in the middle of the system .",
    "further dislocation activity breaks up the string of vacancies into smaller clusters .",
    "to analyse the process by which such a cluster of vacancies is generated , we repeated the relevant part of the simulation , using a higher time resolution for the analysis of the process .",
    "this revealed the detailed process generating these vacancies .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated in figure [ fig : process ] .",
    "dislocation interactions have created dislocations where segments are on different glide planes .",
    "this makes it possible for a segment of a dislocation to be annihilated .",
    "if two edge dislocations gliding on adjacent glide planes annihilate , a string of vacancies is formed .",
    "this appears to be the main source of vacancies in the simulations .    at the end of the simulation ( figure [ fig : sysi](d ) ) a large number of vacancies have been formed , apparently by this mechanism .",
    "the larger system behaves in a similar fashion .",
    "figure [ fig : sysii ] shows the larger system after the deformation . as a large number of dislocations were present , it would have been very difficult to see anything in the figure if the entire system were plotted . for this reason only a slice through the system",
    "again a large number of both dislocations and vacancies are seen .",
    "the simulations presented here indicate that the deformation of fcc metals at ultra - high strain rate occurs by mechanisms that are not very different from what is seen at more moderate strain rates .",
    "even in a situation where there are no preexisting dislocations , and no dislocation sources , dislocations are nucleated and are the main carriers of the deformation . the main difference between the deformation mechanism in the simulations and in slowly deforming materials is how the dislocations are nucleated .",
    "this difference may not be present in a real physical sample under ultra - high - speed deformation , since dislocation sources will be present , even though it is possible that other types of dislocation sources are activated under high strain rate conditions .",
    "the high concentration of vacancies in the simulations is due to the very high dislocation density during the high - speed deformation .",
    "as the vacancies are generated when opposite - signed dislocations collide , it must be expected that the generation rate depends on the dislocation densities obtained and not just on the total deformation .",
    "it is therefore expected that much higher vacancy densities should be observed experimentally after ultra - rapid deformation than after deformation with moderate strain rate .    in the simulations presented here",
    "there are no free surfaces , and no efficient way of removing dislocations except by annihilation .",
    "we therefore expect a higher dislocation density and a higher vacancy production rate than those which would be observed with a more realistic geometry .    to test the effect of free surfaces , we have made a similar simulation with four free surfaces ( i.e.  the system has the form of a rod being pulled ) . in this case dislocations",
    "were nucleated at the corners , passed through the system and disappeared at the free surfaces on the other side of the sample .",
    "only a few dislocations were moving through the system at the same time .",
    "no vacancies were generated , as the dislocations never collided .",
    "preliminary simulations with two free surfaces ( i.e. foil geometry ) indicate that this geometry behaves much like the bulk simulations , as dislocations perpendicular to the surfaces can not move to the surface and disappear .",
    "a large dislocation density builds up , and vacancies are generated .",
    "atomic - scale computer simulations using molecular dynamics indicate that ultra - high - speed deformation of fcc copper occurs by the nucleation and motion of dislocations . even in the absence of dislocation sources",
    ", dislocations will be nucleated at sufficiently high stresses .    during the deformation ,",
    "a large number of vacancies are formed , in agreement with experimental investigations of ultra - high strain rate deformation of thin foils of fcc metals @xcite .",
    "the vacancies are produced when segments of edge dislocations moving on adjacent slip planes annihilate .",
    "this generates `` strings '' of dislocations .",
    "further dislocation activity tends to break these strings into smaller clusters .",
    "finally , over time spans much longer than those which we can simulate using molecular dynamics , the vacancies will diffuse and will eventually cluster , forming stacking fault tetrahedra .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "kiritani for fruitful discussions .",
    "center for atomic - scale materials physics ( camp ) is sponsored by the danish national research foundation .",
    "this work was done as a collaboration between camp and the engineering science center for structural characterization and modelling of materials at materials research department , ris .",
    "parallel computer time was financed by the danish research councils through grant no ."
