    "theoretical studies based on density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite have given remarkable insights into the electronic and magnetic properties of both molecules and solids @xcite .",
    "in particular , a number of these studies attempt to quantitatively describe the magnetic interaction in a broad range of systems including transition metals @xcite , hypothetical atomic chains @xcite , ionic solids @xcite , transition metal oxides @xcite and transition metal polynuclear complexes @xcite .",
    "dft uses an effective single - particle picture where spin symmetry is generally broken . for this reason exchange parameters @xmath0 are conventionally extracted by using a mapping procedure , where total energy calculations are fitted to a classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite",
    "this is then used for evaluating the curie or nel temperatures , the magnetic susceptibility and for interpreting neutron diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "notably , the accuracy and reliability of the numerical values of the @xmath0 s depend on the functional used for the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy , being this the only approximated part of the dft total energy @xcite .",
    "calculations based on well - known local functionals , namely the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) , are successful with itinerant magnetism in transition metals @xcite , but largely over - estimates the heisenberg exchange parameters in many other situations @xcite .",
    "additional corrections based on the kinetic energy density ( metagga ) @xcite marginally improves the agreement with experiments @xcite , although an extensive investigation over several solid state systems has not been carried out so far .",
    "these failures are usually connected to the local character of the lda , which is only weakly modified by constructing xc potentials including the gradient , or higher derivative of the charge density .",
    "a direct consequence is that the charge density is artificially delocalized in space , leading to an erroneous alignment of the magnetic bands .",
    "these are also artificially broadened .",
    "a typical example is that of nio , which lda predicts as mott - hubbard instead of charge - transfer insulator .",
    "clearly a qualitative failure in describing the ground state results in an erroneous prediction of the exchange parameters .",
    "one of the reasons behind the inability of lda and gga of describing localized charge densities is attributed to the presence of the self - interaction error ( sie ) @xcite .",
    "this originates from the spurious coulomb interaction of an electron with itself , which is inherent to local functionals .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf ) methods , in the unrestricted or spin polarised form , are sie free and produce systematic improved @xmath0 parameters . however , these methods lack of correlation and usually overcorrect .",
    "a typical example is the antiferromagnetic insulator knif@xmath1 for which hf predicts a nearest neighbour @xmath0 of around 2  mev @xcite against an experimental value of 8.6  mev @xcite .",
    "direct sie subtraction , conventionally called self - interaction corrected ( sic ) lda , also improves the results and seems to be less affected by overcorrection @xcite .",
    "similarly hybrid - functionals , which mix portions of hf exchange with the local density approximation of dft , perform better than local functionals and in several situations return values for @xmath0 in close agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that both methods based non - local exchange or sic , are computationally demanding and thus their application to the solid state remains rather limited .",
    "it is then crucial to develop practical computational schemes able to provide a good estimate of the exchange parameters for those systems critical to lda , which at the same time are not numerically intensive .",
    "based on the idea that most of the sie originates from highly localized states , with a charge distribution resembling those of free atoms , vogel et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple sic scheme where the corrections are approximated by a simple on - site term .",
    "this method was then generalized to fractional occupation by filippetti and spaldin @xcite and then implemented in a localized atomic orbital code for large scaling by pemmaraju et al . @xcite .",
    "despite its simplicity the method has been successfully applied to a number of interesting physical systems including , transition metal monoxides @xcite , silver halides @xcite , noble metal oxides @xcite , ferroelectric materials @xcite , high - k materials @xcite , diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite and also to quantum transport @xcite .",
    "the method is strictly speaking not variational , in the sense that a functional generating the asic potential via variational principle is not available .",
    "however , since typically the lda energy is a good approximation of the exact dft energy , although the lda potential is rather different from the exact ks potential , a `` practical '' definition of total energy can be provided . in this work",
    "we evaluate the ability of this approximated energy in describing exchange parameters for a variety of magnetic systems .",
    "the seminal work of perdew and zunger @xcite pioneered the modern theory of sic .",
    "the main idea is that of subtracting directly the spurious si for each kohn - sham ( ks ) orbital @xmath2 .",
    "the sic - lda @xcite xc energy thus writes @xmath3= e_\\mathrm{xc}^\\mathrm{lda}[\\rho^{\\uparrow},\\rho^{\\downarrow}]-\\sum_{n\\sigma}^\\mathrm{occupied}\\delta_n^\\mathrm{sic } , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] is the lda - xc energy and @xmath5 is the sum of the self - hartree and self - xc energy associated to the charge density @xmath6 of the fully occupied ks orbital @xmath7 @xmath8 + e_\\mathrm{xc}^\\mathrm{lda}[\\rho_n^{\\sigma},0]\\:.\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the hartree energy and @xmath10 is the spin index .",
    "the search for the energy minimum is not trivial , since @xmath11 is not invariant under unitary rotations of the occupied ks orbitals . as a consequence",
    "the ks method becomes either non - orthogonal or size - inconsistent .",
    "these problems however can be avoided @xcite by introducing a second set of orbitals @xmath12 related to the canonical ks orbitals by a unitary transformation @xmath13 @xmath14    the functional can then be minimized by varying both the orbitals @xmath15 and the unitary transformation @xmath13 , leading to a system of equations @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lda hamiltonian , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; { \\bf r})+v_\\mathrm{xc}^{\\sigma,\\mathrm{lda}}([\\rho_n^\\uparrow,0 ] ; { \\bf r})$ ] , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the hatree and lda - xc potential respectively .    in equation ( [ kssic - pro ] )",
    "we have used the fact that at the energy minimum the matrix of sic ks - eigenvalues @xmath24 is diagonalized by the ks orbitals @xmath2 .",
    "importantly such minimization scheme can be readily applied to extended systems , without loosing the bloch representation of the ks orbitals @xcite .",
    "the asic method consists in taking two drastic approximations in equation ( [ kssic - pro ] ) .",
    "first we assume that the orbitals @xmath25 , that minimize the sic functional are atomic - like orbitals @xmath26 ( asic orbitals ) thus @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the sic potential and the projector associated to the atomic orbital @xmath26 .",
    "secondly we replace the non - local projector @xmath29 with its expectation value in such a way that the final asic potential reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the orbital occupation ( essentially the spin - resolved mlliken orbital population ) of @xmath32 .",
    "note that in the final expression for the potential a factor @xmath33 appears .",
    "this is an empirical scaling term that accounts for the fact that the asic orbital @xmath34 in general do not coincide with those that minimize the sic functional ( [ p1 ] ) . by construction @xmath35 in the single particle limit , while it vanishes for the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "although in general @xmath36 , extensive testing @xcite demonstrates that a value around 1 describes well ionic solids and molecules , while a value around 1/2 is enough for mid- to wide - gap insulators . in the following we will label with asic@xmath37 and asic@xmath38 calculations obtained respectively with @xmath39 and @xmath35 .",
    "finally we make a few comments over the total energy .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction the present theory is not variational since the ks potential can not be related to a functional by a variational principle .",
    "however , since typical lda energies are more accurate than their corresponding ks potentials , we use the expression of equation ( [ p1 ] ) as suitable energy . in this case",
    "the orbital densities entering the sic are those given by the asic orbital @xmath34 . moreover , in presenting the data , we will distinguish results obtained by using the sic energy ( [ p1 ] ) from those obtained simply from the lda functional evaluated at the asic density , i.e. without including the @xmath40 corrections ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "all our results have been obtained with an implementation of the asic method @xcite based on the dft code _ siesta _ @xcite .",
    "_ siesta _ is an advanced dft code using pseudopotentials and an efficient numerical atomic orbital basis set . in order to compare the exchange parameters obtained with different xc functionals we consider the lda parameterization of ceperly and alder @xcite , the gga functional obtained by combining becke exchange @xcite with lee - yang - parr correlation @xcite ( blyp ) , the nonempirical purdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) gga @xcite , and the asic scheme as implemented in reference @xcite .",
    "calculations are performed for different systems critical to lda and gga , ranging from molecules to extended solids .",
    "these include hypothetical h - he atomic chains , the ionic solid knif@xmath1 and the transition metal monoxides mno and nio .",
    "dft total energy calculations are mapped onto an effective pairwise heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath41 where the sums runs over all the possible pairs of spins . in doing this",
    "we wish to stress that the mapping is a convenient way of comparing total energies of different magnetic configurations calculated with different functionals . in this spirit",
    "the controversy around using the spin - projected ( heisenberg mapping ) or the non - projected scheme is immaterial @xcite .      as an example of molecular systems , we consider h - he monoatomic chains at a inter - atomic separation of 1.625    ( see figure [ chain ] ) .",
    "this is an important benchmark for dft since the wave - function is expected to be rather localized and therefore to be badly described by local xc functionals .",
    "in addition the system is simple enough to be accessible by accurate quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "as basis set we use two radial functions ( double-@xmath42 ) for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 angular momenta of both h and he , while the density of the real - space grid converges the self - consistent calculation at 300 ry .        here",
    "we consider all possible heisenberg parameters .",
    "thus the triangular molecule ( fig.[chain]a ) has only one nearest neighbour parameter @xmath45 , the 5-atom chain ( fig.[chain]b ) has both first @xmath46 and second neighbour @xmath47 parameters , and the 7-atom chain ( fig.[chain]c ) has three parameters describing respectively the nearest neighbour interaction with peripheral atoms @xmath48 , the nearest neighbour interaction between the two middle atoms @xmath49 and the second neighbour interaction @xmath50 .    following reference @xcite , accurate calculations based on second - order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) @xcite",
    "are used as comparison .",
    "the quality of each particular functionals is measured as the relative mean deviation of the nearest neighbour exchange parameters only ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 , @xmath51 ) , since those are the largest ones @xmath52 our calculated @xmath0 values and their relative @xmath53 are presented in table [ table1 ] , where we also include results for a fully self - consistent sic calculation over the b3lyp functional ( sic - b3lyp ) @xcite .    .calculated @xmath0 values ( in mev ) for the three different h  he chains shown in fig.[chain ] .",
    "the caspt2 values are from reference @xcite , while the sic - b3lyp are from reference @xcite .",
    "the last two rows correspond to @xmath0 values obtained from the lda energy calculated at the asic density . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     also in this case local xc functionals largely overestimate @xmath0 , with errors for @xmath54 going from a factor 8 ( lda ) to a factor 4.5 ( gga - type ) .",
    "asic improves these values , although only marginally , and our best agreement is found for asic@xmath55 , while asic@xmath37 is substantially identical to gga .",
    "interestingly the asic@xmath55 performance is rather similar , if not better , to that of meta - gga functionals @xcite .",
    "the situation is however worsened when we consider @xmath0 parameters obtained at the theoretical lattice constant .",
    "the asic - calculated @xmath56 are essentially identical to those from lda and about 2% shorter than those from gga .",
    "since @xmath0 depends rather severely on the lattice parameter we find that at the theoretical lattice constant gga - functionals perform actually better than our asic",
    ". finally , also in this case the @xmath0 s obtained by simply using the lda energies are larger than those calculated by including the sic corrections ( see equation [ p1 ] ) .    in general the improvement of the @xmath0 parameter",
    "is correlated to an higher degree of electron localization , in particular of the ni @xmath57 shell . in table [ table2 ] the magnetic moment of the ni @xmath57 shell @xmath58 , obtained from the mlliken population , is reported .",
    "this increases systematically when going from lda to gga to asic approaching the atomic value expected from ni@xmath59 .",
    "our best result is obtained with lda+@xmath9 , which returns an exchange of 10.47  mev for the same @xmath9 and @xmath0 that fit the experimental lattice constant .",
    "this is somehow superior performance of lda+@xmath9 with respect to asic should not be surprising and it is partially related to an increased localization .",
    "the ni ions @xmath57 shell in octahedral coordination splits into @xmath60 and @xmath61 states , which further split according to hund s rule .",
    "the @xmath60 states are all filled , while for the @xmath61 only the majority are . by looking at the lda dos one can recognize the occupied @xmath62 orbitals ( we indicate majority and minority spins respectively with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) at -3  ev , the @xmath65 at -2  ev and the @xmath66 at about 0  ev , while the empty @xmath67 are at between 1 and 3  ev above the valence band maximum .",
    "the local hund s split can be estimated from the @xmath65-@xmath67 separation .",
    "the asic scheme corrects only occupied states @xcite , and therefore it enhances the local exchange by only a downshift of the valence band . from the dos of figure [ knifdos ]",
    "it is clear that this is only a small contribution .",
    "in contrast the lda+@xmath9 scheme also corrects empty states , effectively pushing upwards in energy the @xmath67 band .",
    "the net result is that of a much higher degree of localization of the @xmath57 shell with a consequent reduction of the ni - ni exchange .",
    "this is similar to the situation described by the hartree - fock method , which however returns exchange parameters considerably smaller than the experimental value @xcite .",
    "interestingly hybrid functionals @xcite have the right mixture of non - local exchange and electron correlation and produce @xmath0 s in close agreement with the experiments .",
    "we further investigate the magnetic interaction by evaluating @xmath0 as a function of the lattice constant .",
    "experimentally this can be achieved by replacing k with rb and tl , and indeed de jongh and block @xcite early suggested a @xmath68 power law with @xmath69 .",
    "our calculated @xmath0 as a function of the lattice constant @xmath57 for lda , gga , asic@xmath55 and lda+@xmath9 ( @xmath9=8  ev and @xmath0=1  ev ) are presented in figure [ fig5.png ] .     as a function of the lattice constant for lda , gga , asic@xmath55 and lda+@xmath9 ( @xmath9=8  ev and @xmath0=1  ev ) .",
    "the symbols are our calculate value while the solid lines represent the best power - law fit.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for all the four functionals investigated @xmath0 varies as a power law , although the calculated exponents are rather different : 8.6 for lda , 9.1 for gga , 11.3 for asic@xmath55 and 14.4 for lda+@xmath9 .",
    "this further confirms the strong underestimation of the exchange constants from local functionals .",
    "clearly the relative difference between the @xmath0 obtained with different functionals becomes less pronounced for small @xmath57 , where the hybridization increases and local functionals perform better .",
    "note that only asic@xmath55 is compatible with the experimental exponent of @xmath70 , being the one evaluated from lda+@xmath9 too large .",
    "importantly we do not expect to extrapolate the lda+@xmath9 value at any distance , since the screening of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath0 changes with the lattice constant .    in conclusion for the critical case of knif@xmath1 the asic method appears to improve the lda results .",
    "this is essentially due to the better degree of localization achieved by the asic as compared with standard local functionals .",
    "however , while the improvement over the bandstructure is substantial , it is only marginal for energy - related quantities . the main contribution to",
    "the total energy in the asic scheme comes from the lda functional , which is now evaluated at the asic density .",
    "this is not sufficient for improving the exchange parameters , which in contrast need at least a portion of non - local exchange .",
    "another important test for the asic method is that of transition metal monoxides .",
    "these have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically and they are the prototypical materials for which the lda appears completely inadequate . in this work",
    "we consider mno and nio , which have respectively half - filled and partially - filled 3@xmath57 shells .",
    "they both crystallize in the rock - salt structure and in the ground state they are both type - ii antiferromagnetic insulators . the nel s temperatures are 116  k and 525  k respectively for mno and nio . in all our calculations we consider double-@xmath42 polarised basis for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 shell of ni , mn and o , double-@xmath42 for the ni and mn 3@xmath57 orbitals , and single-@xmath42 for the empty 3@xmath57 of o. we sample 6@xmath716@xmath716 @xmath72-points in the full brillouin zone of both the cubic and rhombohedral cell describing respectively type i and type ii antiferromagnetism .",
    "finally the real - space mesh cutoff is 500  ry .",
    "the calculated band structures obtained from lda , asic@xmath37 and asic@xmath38 are shown in figures [ mno ] and [ nio ] for mno and nio respectively .",
    "these have been already discussed extensively in the context of the asic method @xcite and here we report only the main features",
    ". for both the materials lda already predicts an insulating behavior , although the calculated gaps are rather small and the nature of the gaps is not what experimentally found . in both cases",
    "the valence band top has an almost pure @xmath57 component , which suggests these materials to be small gap mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "the asic downshifts the occupied @xmath57 bands which now hybridize with the o-@xmath44 manifold .",
    "the result is a systematic increase of the band - gap which is more pronounced as the parameter @xmath33 goes from @xmath73 to 1 .",
    "importantly , as noted already before @xcite , the experimental band - gap is obtained for @xmath74 .     and c ) asic@xmath55 .",
    "the valence band top is aligned at 0  ev ( horizontal line).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     and c ) asic@xmath55 .",
    "the valence band top is aligned at 0  ev ( horizontal line).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we then moved to calculating the exchange parameters . in this case",
    "we extend the heisenberg model to second nearest neighbors , by introducing the first ( @xmath75 ) and second ( @xmath76 ) neighbor exchange parameters .",
    "these are evaluated from total energy calculations for a ferromagnetic and both type ii and type i antiferromagnetic alignments .",
    "our calculated results , together with a few selected data available from the literature are presented in table [ table3 ] .",

    "in this case both the @xmath0 s are rather small and positive ( antiferromagnetic coupling is favorite ) , in agreement with the goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite and the rather low nel temperature .",
    "direct experimental measurements of the exchange parameters are not available and the commonly accepted values are those obtained by fitting the magnetic susceptibility with semi - empirical methods @xcite .",
    "importantly this fit gives almost identical first and second nearest neighbour exchange constants .",
    "in contrast all the exchange functionals we have investigated offer a picture where @xmath76 is always approximately twice as large as @xmath75 .",
    "this gives us a reasonably accurate value of @xmath75 for lda and gga , but @xmath76 is overestimated by approximately a factor 2 , in agreement with previous calculations @xcite .",
    "asic systematically improves the lda / gga description , by reducing both @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this is related to the enhanced localization of the mn @xmath57 electrons achieved by the asic , as it can be seen by comparing the mn @xmath57 magnetic moments ( @xmath58 ) calculated for different functionals ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "thus asic@xmath55 , which provides the largest magnetic moment , gives also @xmath0 s in closer agreement with the experimental values , while asic@xmath37 is not very different from lda .",
    "importantly for half - filling , as in mno , the asic scheme for occupied states is fundamentally analogous to the lda+@xmath9 method , with the advantage that the @xmath9 parameter does not need to be evaluated .",
    "finally , at variance with knif@xmath1 , it does not seem that a portion of exact exchange is strictly necessary in this case .",
    "hartree - fock @xcite results in a dramatic underestimation of the @xmath0 parameters , while b3lyp @xcite is essentially very similar to asic@xmath55 .",
    "curiously the best results available in the literature @xcite are obtained with the pbe0 functional @xcite , which combines 25% of exact - exchange with gga .",
    "the situation for nio is rather different .",
    "the experimentally available data @xcite show antiferromagnetic nearest neighbour and ferromagnetic second nearest neighbour exchange parameters .",
    "the magnitude is also rather different with @xmath87 .",
    "standard local functionals ( lda and gga ) fail badly and overestimate both the @xmath0 s by more than a factor 5 .",
    "asic in general reduces the exchange constants and drastically improves the agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "in particular asic@xmath55 gives exchange parameters only about twice as large as those measured experimentally .",
    "a better understanding can be obtained by looking at the orbital - resolved dos for the ni @xmath57 and the o @xmath44 orbitals ( figure [ fig8 ] ) as calculated from lda and asic .     and c ) asic@xmath55 .",
    "the valence band top is aligned at 0  ev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    there are two main differences between the lda and the asic results .",
    "first there is an increase of the fundamental band - gap from 0.54  ev for lda to 3.86  ev for asic@xmath37 to 6.5  ev for asic@xmath55 .",
    "secondly there is change in the relative energy positioning of the ni @xmath57 and o @xmath44 contributions to the valence band . in lda",
    "the top of the valence band is ni @xmath57 in nature , with the o @xmath44 dominated part of the dos lying between 4  ev and 8  ev from the valence band top .",
    "asic corrects this feature and for asic@xmath37 the o @xmath44 and ni @xmath57 states are well mixed across the whole bandwidth .",
    "a further increase of the asic corrections ( @xmath35 ) leads to a further downshift of the ni @xmath57 band , whose contribution becomes largely suppressed close to the valence band - top .",
    "thus , increasing the portion of asic pushes nio further into the charge transfer regime .",
    "interestingly , although asic@xmath37 gives the best bandstructure , the @xmath0 s obtained with asic@xmath55 are in better agreement with the experiments .",
    "this is somehow similar to what observed when hybrid functionals are put to the test .",
    "moreira et al . demonstrated @xcite that @xmath0 s in close agreement with experiments can be obtained by using 35% hartree - fock exchange in lda . moreover , in close analogy to the asic behaviour , as the fraction of exact exchange increases from lda to purely hartree - fock , the exchange constants decrease while the band - gap gets larger .",
    "however , while the best @xmath0 s are obtained with 35% exchange , a gap close to the experimental one is obtained with b3lyp , which in turns overestimates the @xmath0 s .",
    "this remarks the subtile interplay between exchange and correlations in describing the magnetic interaction of this complex material .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that a fully self - consistent sic @xcite seems to overcorrect the @xmath0 s , while still presenting the erroneous separation between the ni @xmath57 and o @xmath44 states .",
    "in conclusions the approximated expression for the asic total energy is put to the test of calculating exchange parameters for a variety of materials , where local and gradient - corrected xc functionals fail rather badly .",
    "this has produced mixed results .",
    "on the one hand , the general bandstructure and in particular the valence band , is considerably improved and resembles closely data from photo - emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the exchange constants are close to experiments only for the case when the magnetism originates from half - filled shells . for other fillings , as in the case of nio or knif@xmath1 the asic improvement over lda is less satisfactory , suggesting that a much better xc functional , incorporating a portion at least of exact exchange , is needed .",
    "importantly asic seems to be affected by the same pathology of hybrid functional , i.e. the amount of asic needed for correcting the @xmath0 is different from that needed for obtaining a good bandstructure .",

    "<S> asic total energy calculations are mapped onto an heisenberg pair - wise interaction and the exchange constants @xmath0 are compared to those obtained with other methods . in general the asic scheme drastically improves the bandstructure , which for almost all the cases investigated resemble closely available photo - emission data . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the results for the exchange parameters are less satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> although asic performs reasonably well for systems where the magnetism originates from half - filled bands , it suffers from similar problems than those of lda for other situations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the exchange constants are still overestimated . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects a subtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy , not captured by the asic . </S>"
