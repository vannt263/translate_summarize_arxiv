    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite with transition temperatures as high as 150k ( gamnas at @xmath3 mn @xcite ) or even above room temperature ( gamnn , gamnp@xcite ) are attracting much attention lately in part because of possible ` spintronic ' applications @xcite .",
    "the prototypical dms material is ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as with the mn ions substitutionally replacing ga at the cation sites .",
    "it is widely believed that the ferromagnetism in this material is carrier induced with holes donated by mn ions mediating a ferromagnetic interaction between the randomly localized mn spins @xcite .",
    "the coupling of carrier spins ( holes in gamnas ) and localized moments ( mn impurities ) gives rise to the unique magnetic and transport ( as well as optical ) properties in dms .",
    "dms transport properties are influenced by the exchange interaction between the carriers and the localized moments as spin fluctuation scattering contributes to the resistivity .",
    "the experimentally measured dc - resistivity in dms materials @xcite shows interesting behavior strongly depending on the concentration of the magnetic impurity and temperature . in in@xmath4mn@xmath5as @xcite and ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as @xcite with low mn concentration ( @xmath6 ) only an insulating behavior has been observed in transport measurements .",
    "however , near optimal doping @xmath7 , where the highest value of @xmath2 is reported , the non - monotonic behavior ( insulator - metal - insulator ) of the resistivity as a function of temperature is observed .",
    "a resistivity peak appears near the critical temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and the resistivity shows metallic behavior ( @xmath8 ) below @xmath2 and insulating behavior ( @xmath9 ) at higher temperatures .",
    "the peak has been understood as the critical scattering effects at @xmath2 of spin fluctuations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present theoretical calculations for dms transport properties and study the role of the carrier - spin coupling which are crucial for ferromagnetic properties .",
    "transport measurements have proven useful in understanding the physics of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites where carrier - spin coupling is also crucial @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we use a recently developed non - perturbative method , the `` dynamical mean - field theory '' ( dmft),@xcite for calculating the dms transport properties .",
    "a non - perturbative method is needed in dms materials because the crucial physics involves bound - state formation and other aspects of intermediate carrier - spin couplings not accessible to perturbative methods .",
    "( we note that the most interesting phenomena in dms involve intermediate couplings and intermediate temperatures .",
    "this regime is very difficult to treat by standard analytical or numerical methods . )",
    "the dmft has been recently applied to the dms system to calculate the magnetic transition temperature and the optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "dmft is essentially a lattice quantum version of the weiss mean field theory where the appropriate density of states ( including impurity band formation ) along with temporal fluctuations are incorporated within an effective local field theory .",
    "an important ingredient of dmft @xcite is that it reduces to the standard rkky physics in the weak - coupling regime and the double exchange physics in the strong coupling regime .",
    "our dmft results show interesting dependence of resistivity on carrier - spin coupling ( @xmath10 ) , carrier density ( @xmath11 ) , doping of the magnetic material ( @xmath12 ) , and temperature ( @xmath13 ) revealing key features of the underlying physics .",
    "we find that our results show many similarities to colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites @xcite , especially , for a large carrier - spin coupling and near half filling of the impurity band ( i.e. in the double exchange regime ) since the spin - disorder scattering dominates in this parameter range .",
    "however , the dms dc - resistivity exhibits novel features not found in the cmr in the weak coupling rkky limit ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the band width of the carrier ) .",
    "these novel features arise mainly from the bound state formation of the carrier - local spins and carrier occupation of the minority spin band .",
    "the formation of the bound state gives rise to an insulating behavior even if the carrier localization effects are not taken into account .",
    "experimental observation of our predictions should lead to crucial information about bound state formation and impurity band physics in this problem .",
    "even though we focus on iii - v compound based dms such as ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as , the results presented in this paper are general for all dms materials .",
    "an important limitation of dmft is that it is a non - perturbative _ local _ theory that can not really incorporate _ spatial _ fluctuations , and therefore resistive charged impurity scattering with its strong momentum dependence is essentially impossible to handle in dmft .",
    "we therefore consider the boltzmann transport theory to calculate the resistivity of the dms systems @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann theory is used to calculate the charged impurity disorder limited dms resistivity ( whereas the dmft is used for obtaining the spin disorder limited dms resistivity ) .",
    "charged impurity disorder arises here both from the ionized mn acceptor in gamnas as well as other charged defects / impurities invariably present in a semiconductor . using relaxation time approximation",
    "we assume that the boltzmann resistivity is due to ionized impurities .",
    "the carriers ( holes ) are scattered by the screened coulomb potential , which we calculate using the linearized thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we find that the dominant temperature dependence of the resistivity comes from the change in the screening length in the high density metallic samples . in the metallic gamnas",
    "dms samples the change in the measured resistivity , when the temperature goes from @xmath2 to zero , is about 20% in good agreement with our calculation . in the ferromagnetic state ( @xmath1 ) , as the temperature decreases from @xmath16 , we find strong temperature dependence of the resistivity arising from the low temperature screening function and the thermal change of the carrier densities in each spin - split subband . when all the carriers are polarized ( this happens in the low density limit ) the screening function is almost independent of temperature and the resistivity is also temperature independent .",
    "inclusion of both spin disorder and ionized impurity disorder in dms transport is the important ingredient of our theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our model and our theoretical approach based on the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we study , in detail , the density of states and describe the formation of the spin polarized impurity band . in sec .",
    "iv , we provide the results of calculated dms resistivity within dmft . in sec .",
    "v we calculate the transport resistivity within the boltzmann transport theory for ionized impurities . in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our qualitative findings and providing a critical discussion of the applicability of our results to dms systems . a brief conclusion is given in sec .",
    "our basic model of dms systems is that of magnetic dopants ( `` impurities '' ) interacting through a local exchange coupling with carriers in the host semiconductor material .",
    "the generally accepted hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes carrier propagation in the host semiconductor band .",
    "for simplicity we consider a host material with a single non - degenerate band .",
    "we therefore write @xmath19 \\psi _ { \\alpha } ( x),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the spin index and @xmath21 is a random potential arising from non - magnetic defects in the material ( e.g. , as antisite defects , unintentional background charged impurities , etc . ) .",
    "the second ( magnetic ) term in eq . ( [ ham ] ) , @xmath22 , describes coupling of the carriers to an array of impurity ( e.g. mn ) spins at positions @xmath23 , @xmath24 \\psi_{\\beta } ( r_i),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the local exchange coupling between the spin of the magnetic impurity and the the spins of the semiconductor carriers , @xmath25 is the ( coulombic ) potential arising from the magnetic dopant , @xmath23 are the positions of the magnetic dopants , and @xmath26 is the pauli matrix . here",
    "we absorb the magnitude of the impurity spin into the coupling @xmath10 ( which we take to be positive ) , and represent the spin direction by the unit vector @xmath27 .",
    "the third term in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , @xmath28 , is the direct mn@xmath29mn short - range antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a direct antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between impurity spins .    in this section",
    "we approximate our model by neglecting the nonmagnetic random potential , @xmath21 , and the direct antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , @xmath31 .",
    "lattice defects may be playing an important role in determining magnetic and transport properties of the samples , but we assume here that these defects enter our theory only in determining the basic parameters of the model , namely , the density of magnetically active dopants @xmath32 , the hole density @xmath33 , and perhaps the local effective exchange coupling @xmath10 between the holes and the magnetic impurities , and do not include any defects into our model explicitly .",
    "we include charged impurity scattering through the boltzmann equation in section iv of this paper .",
    "we believe that the effects of the antiferromagnetic coupling between magnetic impurities are either negligibly small or incorporated into the effective parameters of the model . actually ,",
    "in the parameter range of interest to us ( @xmath34 ) , where dms ferromagnetism typically occurs , the magnetic impurities are separated from each other by non - magnetic atoms , and this short - range antiferromagnetic interaction , which rapidly decays with the distance , should be negligible .",
    "these approximations are nonessential and are done in the spirit of identifying the minimal dms magnetic model of interest .",
    "both of these effects , which may be of quantitative importance in some situations , can be included in the theory by adjusting the parameters of the model or perhaps at the cost of introducing more unknown parameters characterizing these interactions .",
    "recently several theories for dms ferromagnetism explicitly including spatial disorder effects and antiferromagnetic coupling have been developed @xcite .    in our dmft dms model",
    "there are two sources of coupling between the carrier and the impurity magnetic moment : a spin - spin coupling ( @xmath10 ) and a potential scattering ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the crucial physical issues are revealed by the consideration of a ferromagnetic state in which all impurity spins @xmath35 are aligned , say , in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "then the carriers with spin parallel to @xmath35 feel a potential @xmath37 on each magnetic impurity site and anti - parallel carriers feel a potential @xmath38 .",
    "these potentials self - consistently rearrange the electronic structure .",
    "the spin - dependent part of this rearrangement provides the energy gain which stabilizes the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the key physics issue is , evidently , whether the potential @xmath39 is weak ( so its effect on carriers near the lower band edge is simply a scattering phase shift ) or strong ( so only majority spin or perhaps both species of carriers are confined into spin - polarized impurity bands ) .",
    "recent density functional supercell calculations @xcite suggest that in gamnas @xmath37 is close to the critical value for bound state formation for the majority spin systems .",
    "unfortunately , the precise effective values of @xmath10 and @xmath25 are typically unknown in a dms system , and may have to be extracted experimentally .",
    "we assume that magnetic impurities under consideration enter substitutionally at the cation sites ( _ e .",
    "g. _ mn impurities at ga sites ) and the iii@xmath4mn@xmath5v system as a lattice of sites , which are randomly nonmagnetic ( with probability @xmath40 ) or magnetic ( with probability @xmath12 ) , where @xmath12 now indicates the relative concentration ( _ i.e. _ per ga site ) of active mn local moments in iiimnv .",
    "if more complete information about mn locations on the gaas lattice becomes available it will be straightforward to incorporate that in the dmft formalism .",

    "( [ ham ] ) . within the general scheme of the dmft",

    "all of the relevant physics may be determined from the local ( momentum - integrated ) green function defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the density of states ( dos ) for the noninteracting system .",

    "given such a complex parameter space , it is not meaningful to try to develop quantitative transport theories at this early stage of the subject since all the intrinsic parameters may not be known .",
    "we therefore focus in this work on developing a comprehensive qualitative theoretical description which emphasizes general broad features of how various parameters affect dms transport behavior . as such",

    "we neglect _ all _ localization effects in our theory .",
    "the localized gamnas regime in all likelihood requires its own characteristic theoretical description such as the bound magnetic polaron percolation theory @xcite whose transport properties @xcite have recently been theoretically analyzed .    even without the disorder - induced strong localization complications , neglected completely in this work , we face the formidable difficulty of using the semiconductor valence / conduction band ( the valence band for gamnas , where the carriers mediating the ferromagnetic interaction are holes ) or the magnetic impurity induced impurity band ( i.e. mn induced d - band in the fundamental band gap of gaas ) picture for describing the carrier dynamics . the precise nature (",
    "i.e. valence band versus impurity band ) of the dms carriers is still a controversial issue although it is likely that at the very high doping densities ( e.g. mn density @xmath248 in gamnas ) of dms interest the impurity band overlaps strongly with the valence band ( i.e. forms the tail of the valence band ) , and therefore , the distinction between the valence and the impurity band picture is not a real qualitative difference .",
    "our dmft theory , presented in sections ii - iv of this paper , clearly shows that in the strong exchange coupling ( @xmath249 ) regime the impurity band picture applies whereas in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath250 ) , the valence band picture applies .",
    "it is possible that gamnas belongs to the intermediate coupling regime ( @xmath251 ) , where it may be more appropriate to think of the holes to be residing in the extended tail of the valence band , presumably with an enhanced effective mass compared with the gaas valence band hole mass .",
    "such a coupled impurity - valence band picture of gamnas is consistent with recent optical spectroscopy measurements @xcite , but more experimental work is needed to settle this question .",

    "6  10 of this paper show qualitative difference between the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath252 ) with an impurity band well - separated from the semiconductor band and the intermediate - coupling regime ( @xmath253 ) with only band - tailing and no separate impurity band formation .",
    "temperature , carrier density , and impurity concentration all play qualitatively important roles in determining the dc transport properties within dmft , and sorting out the details with respect to experimental results may be extremely difficult .",
    "the weakness of dmft is that it can only include spin - disorder scattering ( controlled by @xmath10 ) and mn impurity induced local potential scattering ( controlled by @xmath25 ) effects on transport properties . as such it leaves out the most important scattering mechanism which may be operational in real samples , namely scattering by charged impurities which is often the most important resistive scattering process in heavily doped semiconductos below the room temperature ( or the optical phonon scattering regime which may well be above the room temperature ) .",

    "we note that our dmft and boltzmann transport theories are complementary ",
    "dmft treats the spin disorder and the local potential scattering associated with mn dopants and boltzmann theory treats the scattering by screened charged impurity scattering .",
    "the magnetic dms properties enter the boltzmann theory only indirectly through the carrier spin polarization calculations .",
    "spin disorder scattering is _ not _ explicitly included in the boltzmann theory although it is straightforward to do so .",
    "our boltzmann theory manifests nontrivial interplay among temperature dependent screening , temperature dependent spin polarization ( i.e. spin up - down carrier densities ) , and thermal energy averaging , leading to temperature dependent resistivity ( figs .",
    "13 and 14 ) that are rather similar to experimental observations @xcite in gamnas . based on this qualitative similarity",
    "we conclude that much of gamnas dms transport is dominated by screened charged impurity scattering with spin disorder scattering playing only a rather minor quantitative role .",
    "recently , lopez - sancho and brey @xcite have come to a very similar conclusion for gamnas transport properties .",
    "schematic diagram for the experimental gamnas dc - resistivity for decreasing hole density ( from bottom to top ) ( see ref . [ 3 ] ) .",
    ", width=211 ]    before concluding we now discuss our theoretical results in light of the existing dms transport data . although there are some experimental transport data in other dms systems ( most notably inmnas with qualitatively similar behavior to gamnas ) , truly extensive and reliable transport data@xcite are available only for ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as ( in the @xmath257 regime ) dms samples . even for this well - studied system ,",
    "experimental transport results are problematic , and have considerable spread in the sense that nominally `` identical '' gamnas samples ( i.e. same nominal carrier density and mn concentration made in the same growth run ) may have different @xmath2 and transport properties .",
    "this situation is improving as sample quality and processing ( e.g. annealing ) techniques improve , but experimental dms transport properties are still not robust in a quantitative way .",
    "this is of course very understandable given the very large parameter space ( i.e. exchange coupling , hole density , mn concentration , defects and impurities , compensation , band structure parameters , etc ) that dms transport depends on . with these serious caveats we show in fig .",
    "15 a schematic depiction of the generic experimental observation for @xmath240 in gamnas for various hole densities . at high hole density",
    "the system shows `` metallic '' behavior for @xmath1 with @xmath240 increasing somewhat with @xmath13 upto @xmath2 , and then decreasing slowly for @xmath0 .",
    "even the optimally doped most `` metallic '' gamnas is , however , at best a bad metal with mobilities of the order of 10 @xmath258 with @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the transport mean free path .",
    "it is important to realize that dms transport is always extremely highly resistive due to the very large amount of impurities and defects invariably present in the low temperature mbe process needed for producing homogeneous gamnas samples .",
    "thus , from the perspective of heavily doped semiconductors , although the dms systems may be above the mott limit ( i.e. the carrier density in the mott metallic range ) , they are close to being anderson insulators due to strong disorder effects .",
    "as hole density decreases the system eventually becomes an insulator at low enough carrier densities ( the top curve in fig .",
    "15 ) , with @xmath240 decreasing monotonically increasing @xmath13 .",
    "two generic features of fig .",
    "15 are : ( a ) a peak ( or a kink ) in @xmath240 near @xmath261 , and ( 2 ) the slow decrease of @xmath240 for @xmath0 . both of these generic features of @xmath240 as well as the `` metallic '' high - density behavior are qualitatively ( perhaps even semi - quantitatively ) well - explained by our boltzmann theory approach including only scattering by ionized impurity scattering .",
    "this is apparent by comparing fig .",
    "15 with figs .",
    "14 and 13 where our boltzmann theory results are shown .",
    "physically , the increasing @xmath240 with @xmath13 ( @xmath262 ) arises from the decreasing strength of screening due to the interplay of two independent and competing physical effects : temperature induced suppression of screening and spin polarization ( i.e. the spin polarization decreasing with increasing temperature ) induced enhancement of screening with increasing temperature . as explained in sec .",
    "v the competition between these two effects depend on the carrier density , leading to some weak non - monotonicity in @xmath240 for @xmath1 . in this screening picture ,",
    "the resistivity peak or cusp at @xmath263 arises from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition which affects screening as the carrier density of states ( which is inversely proportional to the screening length ) changes from one in the fully spin polarized state to two in the fully paramagnetic phase .",
    "thus , even without any spin disorder scattering effects , just screened ionized impurity scattering by itself will give rise to the peak or the kink in @xmath240 at @xmath16 .",
    "we believe that spin disorder scattering , which also produces a kink at @xmath263 ( see , for example , figs . 7 and 9 ) , play only a minor role in the resistivity `` maximum '' at @xmath2 in optimally metallic gamnas with most of the peak structure arising from the screening properties of ionized impurity scattering .",
    "the second generic experimental feature in fig .",
    "15 , the slow decrease of @xmath240 for @xmath0 , can not be explained _ at all _ by spin disorder scattering since spin disorder should remain large in the paramagnetic system ( @xmath99 ) and certainly should not decrease with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "our boltzmann theory provides a natural explanation ( figs .",
    "13 and 14 ) for the decreasing @xmath264 as arising from the energy averaging of the relaxation time ( eq .",
    "19 ) , i.e. , @xmath240 decreases with increasing @xmath13 simply because the holes move `` faster '' at higher temperatures ( i.e. increasing kinetic energy with increasing @xmath13 ) .",
    "this decreasing @xmath240 with increasing @xmath13 ( @xmath265 ) also shows that our neglect of phonon scattering in the transport theory is a valid approximation since phonon effects will always increase @xmath240 with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath240 will increase again when phonon scattering starts dominating over ionized impurity scattering at much higher temperatures .",
    "the relative lack of importance of phonon scattering in dms systems arises from their very strong charged impurity resistive scattering effects as reflected in very small sample mobilities .",
    "in this paper we investigate the transport properties of the diluted magnetic semiconductors using dynamical mean field theory and boltzmann transport theory .",
    "we have shown that the resistivity depends strongly on the system parameters , i.e. , exchange coupling , carrier density , doping , and temperature . the resistivity drop with decreasing temperature in the ferromagnetic state",
    "can be partially explained by the screening theory for metallic samples .",
    "the parameter dependence of the resistivity contains important information about the physics of diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "we find that in the strong exchange coupling regime the spin disorder scattering and the formation of the bound state in the impurity band compete to produce an unusual behavior in the temperature dependent resistivity .",
    "we also show that in the weak coupling regime the occupation of the minority spin band is critical to the scattering mechanisms , and substantially reduces the resistivity because the repulsive interaction between local moments and `` wrong - spin '' carriers suppresses the carrier amplitude at the impurity site , reducing the effective carrier - spin coupling .",
    "our boltzmann transport theory for charged impurity scattering is good qualitative agreement with the existing dms experimental data , showing that transport in dms gamnas system may very well be dominated primarily by screened ionized impurity scattering ( with spin disorder scattering playing only a minor secondary role ) , at least for the optimally doped metallic gamnas samples .",
    "we have completely neglected detailed band structure complications ( e.g. spin - orbit coupling in the valence band ) in our theory .",
    "these effects are certainly very important , but our interest in this paper is the development of a conceptually coherent qualitative theory for dms transport identifying the main transport mechanisms , and as such we have neglected all nonessential complications .",
