    "the energy balance between photoelectrons and forbidden line cooling sets the gas temperature to @xmath6 k in the region @xcite .",
    "the structure of region has been studied in terms of the balmer recombination lines of hydrogen atoms , the observations of other optical forbidden lines ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath16716 , [ ] @xmath13727 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our understanding of the region has been advanced considerably in recent times with the aid of the wisconsin h@xmath2 mapper ( wham ) data @xcite . with a velocity resolution capability of 8@xmath812 km / s ,",
    "wham measured the h@xmath2 emission from warm ionized objects within @xmath9100 km s@xmath4 of the local standard of rest and provided the first large - scale h@xmath2 survey , covering the three - quarters of the northern sky .",
    "the survey results show that enhancements can generally be seen near the planetary nebulae and regions surrounding massive o and early b - type stars ; the results also confirm the presence of unidentified high galactic components @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 vir ( spica ) , one of the brightest stars at a high galactic latitude , was found to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary with spectral types b1 v and b4 v @xcite .",
    "the existence of the region around @xmath2 vir was suggested because the region appeared to be a hole in radio observations @xcite and ultraviolet absorption lines were seen for the star of the nearby sightline @xcite .",
    "equipped with a fabry - perot spectrometer , @xcite made h@xmath2 scans and revealed that the region was indeed ionized with a gas density of @xmath100.6 @xmath5 .",
    "the hydrogen ionization rate of the whole region was estimated to be @xmath10 @xmath11 photons s@xmath4 .",
    "the ratio of [ ] @xmath16716 to the h@xmath2 line , which signifies the contribution of collisional excitation with enhanced temperature , was also made for the spica region ( spica nebula ) .",
    "while the spica nebula is generally accepted as a normal region , the ratio was found to be rather high ( 0.16 at the center and 0.21 at the edge ) , compared to those of other regions such as the orion nebula ( 0.019 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sharpless 261 ( 0.059 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though its origin was not clearly identified @xcite .",
    "recently , the spica nebula was observed in the wham survey @xcite , but no detailed study of this set of data has yet been published .    and ion lines were detected in the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) absorption line study towards spica , and their origin was ascribed to the local bubble ( lb ) surrounding the sun @xcite .",
    "being a photoionized region , the spica nebula may not be associated with these high - stage fuv lines , but it can still be a source of fuv emission from low - stage ions , especially in view of the high [ ] @xmath16716 to h@xmath2 line ratio . in this paper , we analyze the fuv @xmath0 and emission lines as well as the wham survey data , to study the region around spica . it should be noted that the ionization potentials of si@xmath12 and al@xmath12 are similar to that of hydrogen : 16.4 ev for si@xmath12 and 18.8 ev for al@xmath12 . as the spatial structure of the spica region was not explored previously and there have been no reports of the emission line study in the fuv wavelengths , we believe the present study should provide useful information about the global morphology of the nebula . for the fuv study , we use the same data set as the one used for our previous analysis of loop i superbubble ( l1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; that data set was obtained from the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( fims ) on the korean microsatellite _",
    "stsat-1 _ @xcite .",
    "the fims is an instrument optimized for the measurement of diffuse fuv emissions with a large field of view ( @xmath13 ) for the wavelength band of 1330@xmath81720 .",
    "we also compare the observational results with the results of the cloudy photoionization model so that we can constrain the physical parameters associated with the region and @xmath2 vir itself .",
    "in figure 1 , we plot spectra for the three distinct regions of the spica nebula : the core region within @xmath14 circle including the central point source , @xmath2 vir , in the top panel ; the nebula region defined by @xmath15 circle @xcite in the middle panel ; and the background of a 12@xmath1612square outside the nebula in the bottom panel .",
    "the spectra were binned with 1  and smoothed with a 3  wide boxcar .",
    "for comparison , we also include in the top panel the spectrum for @xmath2 vir as observed by international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) .",
    "as can be seen in the top panel , the prominent absorption lines of @xmath17 1393.8 , 1402.8 in the _ iue _ spectrum , which undoubtedly originate from the stellar atmosphere , appear as strong emission lines in the diffuse fims spectrum ; these lines indicate the extended hot gas around the central star .",
    "similar features can also be identified for @xmath0 @xmath11533.4 and the doublet @xmath17 1548.2 , 1550.8 . however , as shown in the middle panel , the emission lines are not seen in the nebula region while @xmath0 , doublet and @xmath11670.8 are bright .",
    "the doublet is also conspicuous in the background region ( bottom panel ) while both the @xmath0 and lines become less prominent compared to the nebula region .",
    "hence , only the @xmath0 and may actually be the dominant emission lines in the nebula region as the doublet seen in the middle panel could be contributed from the projected background .",
    "we have constructed fuv spectral images of the spica nebula ( radius of @xmath108 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , extended to 12@xmath1812to include the nearby background medium .",
    "the @xmath0 and images were made by utilizing the healpix scheme @xcite with a pixel resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath0 and lines were fitted with single gaussian profiles in the spectral range 1520@xmath81546  and 1658@xmath81684  , respectively , for each pixel .",
    "the images were smoothed with a gaussian function whose full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) was 3 . the resulting signal to noise",
    "( s / n ) ratios for the bright features of the nebula are above 3.0 for both @xmath0 and .",
    "figure 2 shows the final @xmath0 and images taken from fims .",
    "it also displays the h@xmath2 image taken from @xcite and the map taken from @xcite .",
    "we designated @xmath2 vir in these images with an asterisk at @xmath20 .",
    "the black circles with a radius of 8 , correspond to 12 pc for a distance of 80 pc to @xmath2 vir ; they indicate the region conventionally defined as the spica nebula @xcite .",
    "first , we note that the @xmath0 image in figure 2a shows an asymmetric feature with strong enhancement in the southern region below @xmath2 vir .",
    "the southern enhancement is also seen in the h@xmath2 map of figure 2c and seems to be related to the high neutral hydrogen density shown in figure 2d .",
    "this asymmetric feature is less clear in the map of figure 2b ; it does not show much difference between the northern and southern parts though the image seems to extend from the round - shaped central peak to the northwest direction , where the emission of h@xmath2 is somewhat enhanced . in figure 2c",
    ", we overplotted the contours from @xmath21 @xmath22 to @xmath23 @xmath22 with @xmath21 @xmath22 intervals : @xmath24 @xmath21 @xmath22 generally corresponds to the northern region above @xmath2 vir ; @xmath21 @xmath10 @xmath25 @xmath22 represents a band that passes through the southern region ; and @xmath26 @xmath25 @xmath22 represents the area below the spica nebula . in figure 2d ,",
    "a cavity is seen in the vicinity of @xmath2 vir which is probably generated by the strong lyman continuum from the star that causes almost all of the neutral hydrogen atoms to be ionized .",
    "we constructed radial profiles of the h@xmath2 , @xmath0 and intensities for the spica nebula .",
    "because the h@xmath2 and @xmath0 images show strong asymmetry , we made the northern and southern intensity profiles separately by averaging the intensity for the corresponding concentric semicircles of 1bins up to 8 .",
    "we subtracted the background radiation in these profiles : 1.4 rayleigh ( r ) for h@xmath2 , the average value of the galactic latitudes between 40@xmath27 and 60@xmath27 @xcite ; 0.03 r for @xmath0 and 0.04 r for where 1r = 8.0 @xmath18 10@xmath28 photons @xmath22 s@xmath4sr@xmath4 .",
    "we also made extinction corrections by using the extinction curve given by @xcite though the corrections are not significant . with an assumed _ e(b - v ) _ value of 0.01 for the region , the extinction corrected intensities of h@xmath2 , @xmath0 and are respectively , about 1.02 , 1.08 and 1.07 times the observed intensities @xcite .",
    "the top panel in figure 3 shows the resulting profiles .",
    "the solid line represents the northern profiles and dashed lines represents the southern profiles .",
    "the rather large error bars come from the significant spatial variation that still exists within each semicircle bin .",
    "as expected , in the h@xmath2 and @xmath0 intensities we see a marked difference between the northern and southern regions with a much slower decrease for the southern profiles ; in contrast , the intensity does not show a marked difference between the northern and southern profiles .",
    "the southern h@xmath2 profile even shows a flat region from 3 pc to 8 pc , which is undoubtedly due to the fact that the density increases with distance .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 3 shows the model profiles obtained from a photoionization simulation and will be discussed in later section .    in figure 4",
    "we show a scatter plot of _ n _ ( ) against the h@xmath2 intensity . a correlation is seen for _ n _ ( ) below @xmath25 @xmath22 and the 0.62 correlation coefficient confirms that the h@xmath2 enhancement in the southern spica region can be attributed to that region s high neutral hydrogen density .",
    "hence , the spica nebula is ionization - bounded in the southern region with an ionization front at _ n _ ( ) = @xmath25 @xmath22 .",
    "the h@xmath2 intensity drops significantly to 1.6 r ( log h@xmath2=0.2 ) for _ n _ ( ) @xmath26 @xmath25 @xmath22 ( log _ n_()=20.78 ) ; and the intensity drop implies that any h ionization photons that pass through this dense ambient medium are dissipated in the medium .",
    "it should be noted that the 1.6 r value that we obtained here is very similar to the average value ( 1.4 r ) for the galactic latitudes between 40@xmath27 and 60@xmath27 , which were estimated by @xcite .",
    "the observed intensity profiles of the northern and southern regions shown in the top panel of figure 3 are compared with model calculations for the corresponding regions . when we ran the photoionization simulation code cloudy , we varied the lyman continuum luminosity , q(_h _ ) , the effective temperature of the central star , and the density of the ambient medium .",
    "the simulation was performed for a spherically symmetric nebula by using the stellar atmospheric model of @xcite and by assuming the b star abundance reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we obtained the volume emissivity as a function of the radius and calculated the intensity toward a line of sight defined by the offset angle from the central star .",
    "finally , we smoothed the profiles with a gaussian function whose fwhm was 3for a direct comparison with the observations .",
    "first , the calculation was performed for a constant density medium , corresponding to the northern region where density is more or less uniform .",
    "the results are shown as solid lines in the bottom panel of figure 3 .",
    "the model that fits best the northern h@xmath2 profile was obtained with q(_h _ ) = @xmath3 photons s@xmath4 , effective temperature of 26,000 k , and the density of 0.22 @xmath5 .",
    "these values of q(_h _ ) and the effective temperature are quite similar to previous estimates of @xmath11 photons s@xmath4 in @xcite and 25,791 k in @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , the density is much smaller than the result of 0.6 @xmath5 estimated by @xcite , probably because the observation was made for the brightest portion of the nebula which is located in the central region . on the other hand ,",
    "the model profiles of @xmath0 and are quite different from the corresponding observed profiles , especially in the outer region beyond 3 pc , where the observed profiles show a much slower decrease with distance and have extended tails .",
    "in addition , the model profile shows a much higher central peak intensity with a sharper decrease than the observed profile even inside 3 pc .",
    "these aspects will be discussed later , together with the results of the southern profiles .",
    "next , we modeled the southern region in which _",
    "n _ ( ) is seen to increase outwards . as our goal was to study the general trends affected by the density gradient , not to reproduce the observed profiles exactly , we used the power - law model built in the code cloudy , even though it may not represent the density profile accurately : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density at @xmath31 , which was taken to be 0.3 pc .",
    "best fit was obtained by matching the h@xmath2 profiles with fixed q(_h _ ) and effective temperature from the simulation for the northern region .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath2 @xmath32 -0.15 ( corresponding to the density of 0.38 @xmath5 at r = 12 pc ) , and the model profiles are shown as dashed lines in the bottom panel of figure 3 .",
    "the h@xmath2 fit looks more or less reasonable although the model shows a little higher central peak with a sharper decrease , which probably originates from the limits imposed by the power law profile of the model .",
    "however , the most significant discrepancies seem to be in the @xmath0 and profiles .",
    "for example , the model @xmath0 profile does not show such an enhancement as the one seen in the observed profile region between 2 pc and 8 pc , not responding to the outward density increase .",
    "the density gradient effect is not manifested in the model result , either , with a profile very similar to that of the northern region .",
    "in fact , for , both the northern and southern observations look similar , with smaller central peaks and broader profiles than the models .",
    "hence , several discrepancies exist between the observation results and those of a simple photoionization model such as cloudy .",
    "for example , the observed @xmath0 and profiles show extended tails not reproduced by cloudy .",
    "the observed @xmath0 profile shows the effect of the increasing density gradient in the southern region of the nebula while the model does not reproduce the feature .",
    "the observed profile , compared to the model profile , is significantly broader with a much smaller central peak ( about 25% of the model ) .",
    "in addition , the observed profile does not respond to the density gradient .",
    "we would like to discuss these peculiar features here .",
    "first , we believe the extended tails seen in the observed profiles are caused by the background of enhanced temperature .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows the existence of the doublet in the nebula regions as well as in the background , which can hardly be produced by photoionization in regions .",
    "it should also be noted that and ions were detected recently towards spica @xcite .",
    "we will argue later that the spica nebula is located close to the interface between the l1 and lb , which contain hot gases .",
    "in addition to this background hot gas , the spica nebula may actually be embedded in a medium of enhanced temperature . the temperature profile",
    "obtained from our photoionization model for the southern region of the nebula shows a temperature drop from @xmath105,000 k to @xmath103,000 k with a change in distance from 1 pc to 4 pc , while it remains more or less at @xmath105,000 k in the northern region . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that the ratio of [ ] @xmath16716 to the h@xmath2 line was observed to be rather high in the spica nebula region with its value of 0.21 at @xmath33 @xcite , as mentioned previously . assuming the general line ratio of 1.3 for [ ] @xmath16716/@xmath16731 @xcite , the [ ] @xmath176716 + 6731/h@xmath2 is estimated to be 0.36 .",
    "this value is rather high for a photoionized region and actually resides between those of a general region and a mixing layer of shocked gases @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the model @xmath0 profile would have been more responsive to the density increase if the ambient medium were assumed to be of enhanced temperature , the situation which the present cloudy model does not simulate .",
    "the enhanced temperature may also cause broadening of the observed profile .",
    "however , the profile , both in the observation and in the model , does not show north - south asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the observed central peak is much smaller than that expected from the model .",
    "we believe this discrepancy originates from the multiple resonant scattering of in the nebula , which is not properly considered in the photoionization model cloudy .",
    "the resonance lines , such as , undergo many resonant scattering events , resulting in a much longer random walk before they can escape the nebula .",
    "the numerous scatterings can yield a consequently higher probability of being absorbed by dust .",
    "while detailed calculation requires extensive scattering simulations which are not pursued here , a simple estimation would demonstrate reduction of intensity to the observed value . using the al@xmath34 column density 13.05 @xmath22 and the average nebular temperature 10@xmath35 k obtained from the current photoionization model , the optical depth of the resonance scattering of",
    "is estimated to be 22.9 @xcite .",
    "the number of scattering within a medium would be approximately given by @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "then , the total path length of the random walking photons would be @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the typical nebular size , and the resonant lines would experience @xmath39 times higher dust - extinction than that of the original nebular size ( @xmath40 ) . adopting _",
    "e(b - v ) _",
    "@xmath32 0.01 @xcite , the dust - extinction optical depth of is 1.47 , and thereby only @xmath10 23% of line would escape from the nebula , and the value is roughly consistent with the observed peak intensity .",
    "another effect of this multiple scattering is of course broadening of the radial profile as the photons diffuse out radially through random walks .",
    "the effect of increasing density in the southern region may also have become obscured due to this diffusion .",
    "we further note that the ground state of the singly ionized ion si@xmath34 is split .",
    "the emission lines from the excited state 3@xmath414@xmath42 @xmath43s@xmath44 to the true ground state 3@xmath413@xmath45 @xmath43p@xmath44 ( , 1527 ) and to the excited ground state 3@xmath413@xmath45 @xmath43p@xmath46 ( @xmath0 , 1533 ) has a transition ratio of 1 : 2 .",
    "the true @xmath11527 ground state transition is optically thick and therefore undetectable @xcite . adopting the same way for the",
    ", the optical depth of the resonance line is estimated to be 12.6 .",
    "however , resonantly absorbed make downward transitions with the line ratio of 1 : 2 between and @xmath0 , most of are converted to @xmath0 after only a few resonance scatterings , which halts further resonant scattering ( @xmath47 ) . therefore @xmath0 would not be significantly reduced by dust absorption .    as mentioned above , the southern enhancement in the spica nebula",
    "is clearly associated with the dense region shown in figure 2d , in which _",
    "n _ ( ) increases from less than @xmath48 to over @xmath49 @xmath22 .",
    "this shell bounding the ionization front was initially suggested to be a cloud by @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to note that this shell coincides with the region of interaction between the l1 and lb , called  interaction ring \" ( ir ) @xcite .",
    "the estimated distance to the ir ( @xmath10 70 pc ) is comparable to that of the spica nebula ( 68@xmath892 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "extended morphology of the ir near the spica was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the result indicates that the warm ionized gas in the spica nebula was possibly created in the already disturbed medium by the ir which affects the evolution of the h@xmath2 region significantly .",
    "the h@xmath2 distribution as well as those of @xmath0 and obtained in the fuv wavelengths was analyzed for a 12@xmath1812sky around the spica nebula .",
    "the spatial variation , shown in both h@xmath2 and @xmath0 images , confirmed that the spica nebula is bounded by a high density shell in the southern region which we relate to the  interaction ring \" of the l1 and the lb .",
    "we have also argued that the nebula is possibly embedded in a gas of enhanced temperature , based on that the observed emission profiles have long extended tails and they respond to the density increase in the southern region of the nebula , which is not explained by photoionization only .",
