    "@xcite referred to their blue and violet plate survey of stars and 17 star clusters as an smc wing structure .",
    "however , they were probing a significant extension of the currently known inter - cloud or magellanic bridge of stars and gas connecting the clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the clouds has been addressed by n - body simulations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) showing that a flat , old lmc disk would have evolved to a bar , thick disk and halo , through interactions with the smc .",
    "the magellanic system is extremely rich in extended objects , i.e. star clusters , associations and emission nebulae . @xcite and @xcite provided an overall census with",
    "1074 extended objects in the smc , 6659 in the lmc , along with 114 in the bridge . at that time , a total of 7847 extended objects were catalogued . concerning the bridge census ,",
    "a borderline at @xmath2 was adopted between the smc wing and the bridge ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the more recent literature and their discoveries , @xcite compiled 9305 extended objects in the magellanic system , containing 144 in the bridge .    with newly discovered clusters and",
    "already catalogued ones at the time , @xcite provided 601 star clusters in an smc census ; later , @xcite compiled 2053 clusters in the lmc .",
    "the smc - lmc bridge is known since long ( @xcite ) , but its stellar content and emission nebulae have been little by little disclosed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stellar associations across the entire smc - lmc connection were discovered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these objects are typically extended ( with diameters @xmath3 or about 85 pc ) .",
    "using ccd photometry , @xcite estimated an age of 100 myr for the association idk3 , projected at @xmath4 from the smc and @xmath5 from the lmc .",
    "@xcite analysed the association idk6 (= ica76 ) , which is the closest one projected towards the lmc .",
    "they obtained an age of 100 myr and concluded that it should be spatially located at the lmc far side .",
    "@xcite estimated ages of 10 - 25 myr for 6 bridge associations ( 10 - 63 myr for ica16 , closer to the smc ) , with distances appearing to vary within 14 kpc .",
    "@xcite derived ages for two relatively rich star clusters at the smc wing / bridge borderline , obtaining 110 myr for ngc796 (= l115 or wg9 ) and 140 myr for l114 .",
    "very recently , @xcite carried out a study of 51 clusters in the outermost eastern region of the smc .",
    "the clusters were observed in the infrared colours yjk@xmath6 within the vista magellanic clouds ( vmc ) survey @xcite .",
    "seven objects are in common between the present work and @xcite .",
    "the inter - cloud region can provide information on how the stellar population of a giant tidal structure breaks into a stellar density spectrum , from associations down to star clusters . in turn , this well resolved nearby laboratory can lead us to model and better understand tidal counterparts in more distant interacting galaxies .",
    "the present study has several perspectives : _",
    "( i ) _ using colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to study the radial density profile ( rdp ) of clusters and relatively small associations in the magellanic bridge ; _ ( ii ) _ provide the age and density distributions of the different stellar aggregates and infer a scenario for the cluster and association formation and evolution in the bridge , under the enduring action of tidal forces from both the smc and lmc . in particular , we intend to set constraints to available age and distance ranges ( e.g. @xcite ) using field - star decontamination tools ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and self - consistent parameter analyses recently applied to smc star clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that our methods are described in previous work dealing with analysis of young clusters , in particular embedded ones , in the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we intend to apply the same methods to clusters in the clouds .    in sect .",
    "[ sample ] we describe the observations and reductions and collect parameters in the literature that can be useful for comparison and used as input values for our analysis . in sect .",
    "[ scmds ] we present general properties of the sample objects . in sect .",
    "[ rdps ] we discuss cluster structures by means of rdps and present the cmds . in sect .",
    "[ groups ] we analyse the cmds of ngc796 and two young templates . in sect .",
    "[ method ] we describe the method of analysis and in sect .",
    "[ results ] we present the results , as well as all clusters individually . in sect .",
    "[ discuss ] a discussion is given .",
    "finally , in sect .  [ conclu ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "we obtained images of 15 fields ( together with offset fields ) towards the smc - lmc bridge , containing 14 star clusters and 2 associations .",
    "images were taken in b , v and r using the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope , equipped with the soar optical imager ( soi ) detector .",
    "the r band images were used exclusively for building composed colour images .",
    "soi consists of two @xmath7 ccds , each one with two separate controllers .",
    "the total fov is 5.5 arcmin on a side .",
    "we adopted a @xmath8 pixel binning , which yields a @xmath9 scale .",
    "fields offset by 5 arcmin north of each cluster position were also imaged to help model the background stellar field .",
    "we call these off - cluster fields to distinguish them from the on - cluster fields . for each on - cluster and off - cluster fields , we took long and short exposures .",
    "two short exposure sets of 20s , 15s , and 15s were taken in b , v and r , respectively .",
    "these were used for bright stars . as for the long exposures",
    ", we took @xmath10s in b , we had @xmath11 in v and @xmath12s in the r filters .",
    "data were taken in service mode throughout several months in 2009 and 2010 , as part of soar brazilian time share .",
    "the observation log is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the composite bvr field of the bs216 pointing , where the two ccds are seen .",
    "this field also sampled the clusters ngc796 and wg8 .",
    "a gap of @xmath13 occurs between the ccds .",
    "we always have a cluster centred on the left ccd .",
    "photometric standards ( @xcite ) were observed each night at different airmasses . in the nights of january 16th and 17th , 2010 ,",
    "however , the latter fields were too high .",
    "we then used standards in the sn 1987a neighbourhood ( @xcite ) .",
    "exposure times for the standards varied in order to allow high s / n measurements over the full range of standard mags . from 30 to 50 bias frames were taken by the soar resident astronomers prior to each observing run .",
    "in addition , 20 dome flat images were taken with the 3 filters , except for the last two nights , when 15 dome flats were taken .",
    "typical counts per flat exposure were 16 - 18k for b , 17 - 22k for v , and 18 - 20k for r. the data reductions were carried out within iraf , using the _ mscred _ and _ soar _ packages . for each night , a single coadded image was created from each set of the run bias and flat exposures .",
    "extreme points in the distribution of count values were eliminated and the median count value from the remaining frames was stored in the coadded calibration images .",
    "these were then visually inspected and had their noise statistics cross examined to those of individual exposures .",
    "science images were then processed .",
    "all exposures , including the bias and flat coadds , were first trimmed according to the trimsec parameter in the header .",
    "the overscan region of each ccd controller ( biasec parameter ) was fitted with a cubic spline and the resulting count level at each column was subtracted from the exposed areas .",
    "this was done for the science exposures and calibration images .",
    "the residual bias image was then subtracted from the science exposures and flats .",
    "finally , the exposures were divided by the resulting flat images in each filter , in order to account for non - uniform pixel sensitivity .",
    "the exposures were then separated according to on - cluster or off - cluster , filter and exposure time and then coadded .",
    "a median filtering was used .",
    "the offsets among the exposures to be combined were measured in an automated way , by finding the offset value in ccd positions that maximized the number of matched bright stars in each exposure relative to the first one in the list .",
    "the photometric standards were identified in each exposure , also using an automatic finder .",
    "it runs a basic astrometry using the pixel scale and header parameters and then tries to maximize the number of stars from the list of standards , given a positional tolerance .",
    "measurements on these standards were also made automatically using a 5 pixel aperture .",
    "the iraf digiphot task phot was used .",
    "a psf model was built on each of the standard exposures .",
    "the psf candidates were pre - selected in each standard field ( 2 from @xcite and 1 from sn1987a ) and were found using the same approach as in the case of the photometric standards .",
    "a circularly symmetric gaussian psf was fitted to the stars in each exposure .",
    "the iraf digiphot psf task was used for this purpose .",
    "a calibration equation of the form @xmath14 was fitted in separate for each night using the standards , where @xmath15 is the intrinsic mag in the johnson - cousins system , @xmath16 is the instrumental mag , colour is the standard colour in b - v , @xmath17 is the airmass , and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are fitting coefficients . in order to prevent low s / n measurements and saturated stars from contaminating the calibration , a @xmath20 clipping criterion ( table  [ tab1 ] ) to the list of calibrating stars was applied iteratively until convergence .",
    ".log of observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a comparison of parameters in table  [ tab5 ] ( considering the uncertainties ) with the recent values by @xcite shows the following : _ ( i ) _ a non - negligible difference concerning e(b - v ) , with ours consistent with the external values quoted in table  [ tab2 ] ; _ ( ii ) _ ( ii ) regarding ages , @xcite give a younger value for bs 233 , but older values for bs 239 and , more significantly , for bbds 4 .",
    "although their solution do not fit well the red main sequence stars in our cmds , the discrepancies in age for these last two clusters can be partially explained by the absence of the brightest main sequence stars in their cmd analysis ; _ ( iii ) _ the metallicities are comparable .",
    "the present work shows evidence that the bridge clusters have sizes probably modulated at birth by tidal forces of the lmc and smc .",
    "the present sample is projected in the sky nearer to the less - massive smc galaxy , as indicated by the centroids of the lmc @xmath21 , @xmath22 and smc @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , and the present sample coordinates in table  [ tab3 ] .    compared to a diagnostic - diagram of dynamical evolution for young galactic clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the present bridge clusters ( and the two associations ) have sizes larger than the bulk of embedded clusters in the galaxy .",
    "however , they are considerably smaller than trumpler37 and bochum1 , which have already evolved into associations .    in the last decades",
    "much work has been done on depth effects of the smc .",
    "@xcite used 12 intermediate age and old star clusters to find a triaxial distribution of 1:2:4 ( @xmath25:@xmath26:depth ) , with smc depth effects from 6 to 12kpc .",
    "the 21 cm hi line surveys showed that the smc , and especially the wing , appear to be split into two velocity components ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , with counterparts in cepheid velocities .",
    "the smc would be splitted into a mini - magellanic cloud and the smc remnant , as a consequence of the interactions with the lmc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these studies propose that the smc would extend beyond its tidal radius , based on cepheids in the infrared , @xcite claimed that the smc should be essentially contained in its tidal radius .",
    "we remark that the distance results are a key issue .",
    "the present clusters appear to lie at a distance of @xmath27kpc , thus @xmath28kpc closer than the smc and @xmath29kpc than the lmc .",
    "these results would not fit the scenario where the bridge is a simple connection between both clouds , as implied by models like in @xcite .",
    "thus , our work discloses the presence of a foreground structure that is projected near the edge of the smc wing .",
    "we conclude that the bridge , having arisen in the far side of the lmc ( @xcite ) , may be indeed a tidal arm .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the smc structures reaching the bridge as well by means of cepheids . among the results",
    ", they find that cepheids occur in front of the smc tilted plane .",
    "@xcite found evidence that the stellar component detected at @xmath30kpc is a tidally stripped component from the smc 200myr ago following a close encounter with the lmc .",
    "a deeper insight on the bridge formation , structure and evolution requires a deeper understanding of the lmc and smc interaction history over the last gyrs , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can not rule out an intermediate - age component in the bridge .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that ages of the rgb and agb stars in the central bridge region are likely to range from @xmath31 myr to 5 gyr , implying that these stars were drawn into the bridge at the tidal event and did not form in situ .",
    "the bridge may not have been formed only by tidal stripping , but probably involved also more complex phenomena .",
    "figure  [ fig15 ] shows the age histogram from table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "although the small number of objects , there is a clear dominance towards @xmath32 .",
    "this is a hint to the intrinsic star formation history ( sfh ) in the bridge .",
    "interestingly , this peak basically coincides with the last interaction between the lmc and smc ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the sfh in the bridge may be mixed with older populations , as described above .    from the analysis of hi features , @xcite find complex kinematics inside the bridge and measure @xmath33 in our cluster region .",
    "@xcite found @xmath34 for the lmc , @xmath35 for the smc , and @xmath36 for the bridge . considering the relative velocity between the south - west objects ( present sample ) in the bridge and that of the lmc since the last interaction between the clouds @xcite , we obtain a distance difference of @xmath29kpc , in agreement with the cluster distances in this work .",
    "thus , the tidal dwarf candidate d1",
    "( @xcite ) together with its concentration of clusters and associations are consistent with the observed hi kinematics in the area .",
    "in the present study we derive reddening , metallicity , age , distance modulus and radial density profiles for 14 star clusters and 2 associations of the lmc - smc bridge .",
    "all clusters are found to be quite young , with ages @xmath37 ( except for bs226 with @xmath38 ) , with reddening in the range @xmath39 mag .",
    "their metallicities vary in the range @xmath40 , basically encompassing the values previously found for the young populations in the smc and lmc . regarding reddening , we recall that the total - to - selective absorption in the smc indicates r = 2.7 , lower than the average galactic ratio ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although some very young sample clusters have dust emission detected in spitzer and/or wise ( table 3 ) , the detected reddening values can be essentially explained from the galactic foreground ( tables 4 and 5 ) .",
    "consequently , the dust embedding the clusters does not appear to be much effective in absorbing optical light .",
    "@xcite detected 3 probable dwarf galaxies forming along the lmc - smc bridge .",
    "differently of the early universe dwarf galaxies related to stars and dark matter , the ones found by @xcite in the bridge appear to be tidal products of the latest lmc - smc interaction .",
    "most of the present clusters are part of the tidal dwarf galaxy candidate d1 , which is associated with an hi overdensity , similarly to d2 and d3 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite discovered 9 halo dwarf galaxies , part of them projected on the surroundings of the magellanic clouds and the stream . in this context , the young tidal dwarf galaxies populate as well the lynden - bell plane @xcite , also called vast polar structure ( vpos ) , as recently revised and updated by @xcite .",
    "however , the conclusive association to such a gigantic structure would require kinematical and orbital data for the newly - found dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , an effort in this direction was the determination of distance and heliocentric velocity of the reticulumii ultra - faint dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the transversal velocity is yet needed for a diagnosis .",
    "we suggest that the vpos might as well contain tidal remains of past interactions of the clouds .",
    "tidal dwarfs have been detected and described by models ( e.g. mirabel et al .",
    "1992 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , especially for blobs in tidal arms as far as 100kpc from the antennae . such tidal dwarf candidates have already been detected in the bridge connecting the lmc and smc by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite ( and references therein ) presented detailed numerical simulations of the evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies , investigating the decoupling of tidal dwarfs from the tidal arm .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for important comments and suggestions .",
    "partial financial support for this research comes from cnpq and pronex - fapergs / cnpq ( brazil ) .",
    "bb and bd acknowledge partial financial support from fapesp , cnpq , capes , and the lacegal project .",
