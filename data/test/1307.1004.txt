    "the quantum impurities embedded in superconducting host materials have been the topic of intensive studies for about 50 years ( see the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "early interests predominantly explored in what way the impurities affect the superconducting state of the bulk materials .",
    "it has been established ( by the anderson theorem @xcite ) that the paramagnetic impurities are rather inefficient on the isotropic superconductors or eventually weakly suppress the anisotropic superconducting phases @xcite .",
    "the magnetic ( spinful ) impurities , on contrary , proved to have much stronger influence on superconductivity .",
    "they induce the in - gap states @xcite and with increasing concentration of the magnetic impurities the energy gap of superconducting material is gradually filled - in simultaneously suppressing its critical temperature . on a microscopic level this detrimental effect comes from a pair - breaking character of the spin scattering",
    ".    mutual relationship between the quantum impurities and superconducting materials attracts presently again substantial interests due to intensive studies of the nanoscopic devices , where various artificial quantum impurities ( dots ) are connected to the external superconducting electrodes . in this context",
    ", the main problem refers to the question _ how do the superconducting reservoirs affect the quantum dots _ rather than the other way around . due to the proximity effect the cooper pairs can penetrate the quantum dot , converting it into a sort of the superconducting grain. on the other hand , the strong coulomb repulsion between opposite spin electrons disfavors any double ( or even ) occupancy of the quantum dot . at low temperatures",
    "also the kondo physics additionally comes into the play .",
    "both these phenomena , i.e.  the coulomb blockade and appearance of the kondo singlet state , strongly compete with the induced on - dot pairing . in nanoscopic tunneling junctions",
    "this competition can be explored in a controllable manner , by : a ) varying the qd hybridization with the superconducting lead , b ) affecting the energy gap @xmath2 by applying the magnetic field @xmath3 @xcite , c ) lifting the discrete qd energy levels via the gate voltage , and d ) lowering temperatures to activate the kondo physics .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental studies of the quantum dots connected to the superconducting leads have been summarized e.g.  in refs @xcite .",
    "interplay between the on - dot pairing and the correlation effects can be conveniently investigated in the setup , where the quantum dots are placed between one superconducting ( s ) and another normal ( n ) electrode . in the subgap regime ( @xmath4 )",
    "the tunneling conductance practically entirely originates from the anomalous andreev channel , such spectroscopy can thus directly probe any in - gap states . in experimental realizations of the n - qd - s junctions",
    "the role of quantum dots has been played by the self - assembled inas nanoscopic islands @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , quantum wires @xcite etc .",
    "for instance , using inas quantum dots coupled between the metallic ( golden ) and superconducting ( aluminum ) electrodes provided a clear evidence for the kondo effect coexisting with the induced on - dot pairing manifested by the zero - bias enhancement of the zero - bias andreev conductance @xcite .",
    "tunneling conductance has been recently measured also in the system comprising the indium antimonide nanowires connected to a normal ( gold ) and superconducting ( niobium titanium nitride ) electrode , indicating the majorana type in - gap states @xcite .",
    "other measurements have been done using the three - terminal configurations with the metallic and superconducting electrodes interconnected via the double quantum dots to achieve a controllable cooper pair splitting .",
    "these dots served as quantum forks , where the coulomb repulsion enforced electrons ( released from the cooper pairs ) to move into different normal leads , yet preserving their entanglement .",
    "such transport channel contributed about 10 percent ( for the case of inas quantum dots @xcite ) and nearly 50 percent ( using the carbon nanotubes @xcite ) to the total differential conductance . for the latter case the efficiency has been next",
    "considerably improved @xcite . in experimental measurements there",
    "have also probed the spin - polarized andreev current using the ferromagnetic electrode coupled via the quantum dots to the superconducting lead @xcite . in all these and",
    "many other related experiments @xcite the subgap electron transport is solely provided by the in - gaps states .",
    "their detailed knowledge seems thus to be a timely and important issue .",
    "it is our intention here to gather a systematic information on the in - gap andreev states originating from the scattering either on the magnetic or non - magnetic quantum impurities .",
    "physical aspects of such study have been so far addressed by a number of groups using various techniques @xcite .",
    "since this problem is presently important @xcite we would like to collect the essential results into this single report .",
    "subgap states of the magnetic ( kondo - type ) impurities have been extensively investigated , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally using the two - terminal @xcite as well as three - terminal configurations @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that in - gap states are present also in the case of uncorrelated ( spinless ) quantum dots @xcite .",
    "to illustrate such possibility in section iii we briefly analyze the noninteracting quantum dot , considering evolution of the andreev bound states with respect to @xmath5 [ where @xmath6 denotes the coupling to @xmath7 lead ] for several asymmetric coupling ratios @xmath8 .",
    "next , in sections iv and v , we address the correlation effects responsible for the coulomb blockade and the kondo effect .",
    "our study can be regarded as complementary to the previous pedagogical analysis by j.  bauer _ et al _ @xcite who focused on the in - gap states of the quantum impurity immersed in a superconducting medium for the limit @xmath9 .",
