    "the masslessness of the photon is well established ; indeed experiment shows that @xmath0ev",
    ". however , the vector bosons associated with the weak interactions must be massive .",
    "it has been shown how the non - abelian gauge bosons associated with the electroweak interactions can be given this mass in a way that retains gauge invariance through the higgs mechanism , thereby ensuring the renormalizability of the model@xcite .",
    "+ there is , however , a way of providing a mass to a @xmath1 vector boson that retains renormalizability and unitarity without the use of the higgs mechanism .",
    " stueckelberg mechanism\"@xcite does not involve the presence of an extra degree of freedom in the physical spectrum , in contrast to the higgs mechanism .",
    "3 and 4 , the possibility of the vector boson associated with the @xmath1 sector of the standard model acquiring a mass through the stueckelberg mechanism was examined .",
    "there it was demonstrated that the mass matrix associated with the vector boson in the full @xmath2 electroweak model does not have a vanishing eigenvalue if there is only a single @xmath1 vector and a single higgs doublet and consequently there is no massless photon .",
    "this means that if the stueckelberg mass is non - zero in addition to the usual standard model parameters , the photon can not be massless .",
    "there is no reason why the possibility of having a non - vanishing photon mass should be discarded within the content of the usual standard model ; a non - vanishing stueckelberg mass is consistent with renormalizability and unitarity .",
    "when dealing with the usual standard model , there is no more reason for setting the photon mass equal to zero than there is for setting the cosmological constant equal to zero .",
    "this forces one to consider extensions of the standard model to reconcile it with the observed masslessness of the photon , if indeed ",
    "what is not forbidden must be allowed . \" + the stueckelberg mechanism can be used in conjunction with other models involving gauge symmetries . indeed , its extensions to supersymmetric gauge models@xcite and to spin - two models@xcite have been considered .",
    "it also arises naturally in effective actions generated by string models@xcite .",
    "+ in ref . 4 and 9 ,",
    "the standard model is extended so as to accommodate a massless photon when the stueckelberg mechanism occurs by including a second @xmath1 sector .",
    "this results in the mass matrix for the vectors having a vanishing eigenvalue , so that a massless photon can be incorporated into the model even when a stueckelberg mass arises .",
    "another extension of the standard model that ensures that a massless photon occurs is to embed the @xmath1 symmetry of the standard model into a larger non - abelian gauge group such as in the grand unified @xmath3 model .",
    "since one can not generalize the stueckelberg mechanism so as to accommodate a non - abelian gauge symmetry , the @xmath1 sector of the standard model can not be associated with the stueckelberg mechanism when this @xmath1 gauge symmetry is just a remnant of the larger non - abelian symmetry once its symmetry is broken .",
    "+ with the stueckelberg mechanism having possible application in the standard model , it is relevant to consider some of its field theoretical consequences .",
    "we first examine how the stueckelberg mass is renormalized , showing that on account of gauge invariance , this mass renormalization is dictated by the renormalization of the photon wave function and consequently of the @xmath1 gauge coupling constant .",
    "unlike other masses in the standard model it is not renormalized independently of other quantities that occur .",
    "+ next we demonstrate how in scalar electrodynamics , the presence of a stueckelberg mass for the vector field considerably alters the form of the radiatively generated effective potential in the model .",
    "+ finally , it is shown how the stueckelberg field can be used not only as to permit one to introduce a mass for a @xmath1 vector field , but also to couple a complex vector field to a photon in a way that preserves gauge invariance for the complex vector field . unfortunately , the resulting model , through gauge invariant , is not renormalizable .",
    "it thus appears that only through the higgs mechanism can a massive charged vector field arise if one is only accepting of renormalizable models .",
