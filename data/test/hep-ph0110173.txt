    "with the start of run ii at the tevatron the possibility of detecting a light higgs boson has of course been the focus of much attention .",
    "one suggested experimentally clean search strategy is to look in double diffractive collisions in which the final state contains only intact protons , which escape the central detectors , and the decay products of the higgs , in this case two _ b _ quark jets .",
    "the protons would be tagged in roman pot detectors a long way down stream of the interaction point , allowing a very precise determination of the higgs mass , using the so - called missing mass method @xcite . with such proton tagging , the available center of mass energy of up to 200",
    "gev means that the preferred higgs mass of around 115 gev is kinematically accessible , at least in principle .",
    "the missing mass method can be used in the case where higgs production is _ exclusive _ , that is the process @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , recent calculations of this rate indicate that it is too low to be observable at the tevatron @xcite . the _ inclusive _ process , @xmath1 , however , was recently estimated by boonekamp et al .",
    "@xcite to be large enough to be detectable .",
    "if this turns out to be the case , then the double diffractive channel might still provide a relatively clean environment in which to produce the higgs . in this paper",
    ", we use the monte carlo @xcite to predict the inclusive rate .",
    "implements an ingelman - schlein type model of diffraction @xcite which has proved successful in describing a range of diffractive processes in dis at hera @xcite .",
    "we describe the physics model in section 2 .",
    "we also consider two other double diffractive processes : dijet production and di - photon production .",
    "the cdf collaboration has measured double diffractive dijet production rates in run i @xcite , and we can therefore compare our predictions to these data .",
    "ingelman - schlein type models such as typically predict rates higher than those observed at the tevatron .",
    "our strategy in this paper is to attribute this difference to rapidity gap survival probability : interactions between spectator partons in the beam protons can destroy a rapidity gap produced in a diffractive interaction @xcite .",
    "we assume that the factor necessary to scale our dijet predictions to data is to a good approximation independent of the hard subprocess , and use it to rescale our higgs and di - photon production cross - section predictions .",
    "we expect the di - photon process to be an interesting process to measure in the first years of run ii since , as we shall see , the rates are almost certainly high enough to be observed .",
    "di - photon production is dominated by the quark - quark diagram of figure [ fig : gamgam ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the dijet and higgs production processes which are dominated by gluon exchange .",
    "the di - photon process therefore provides complementary information to the dijet process about the structure of the diffractive exchange in a very clean experimental environment .",
    "generates diffractive hard scattering events in the spirit of the ingelman - schlein model . that is to say it assumes that the production cross - section factorises into a product of regge flux factor and corresponding parton distribution function . at present ,",
    "two regge exchanges are included which we refer to as `` pomeron exchange '' ( @xmath2 ) and `` reggeon exchange '' ( @xmath3 ) . in the current version of it",
    "is not possible to mix the two exchanges .",
    "for particular details of the default parameterisations ( which we use in this paper ) see @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : higgs ] illustrates the mechanism by which we generate higgs boson production in . in all cases , the higgs is accompanied by `` pomeron remnants '' .",
    "this whole system is separated by rapidity gaps from the outgoing hadrons due to the requirement that the energy fraction lost by the incoming hadrons , @xmath4 , is small ( the transverse momentum transfer to the outgoing hadrons is also small ) .",
    "more specifically the total cross - section for producing higgs bosons in events where the incoming hadrons lose a fraction of their momenta less than @xmath5 ( assuming the top quark is sufficiently heavy ) is @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the hadron - hadron centre - of - mass energy ) and the diffractive gluon density for hadron @xmath9 in pomeron exchange is @xmath10 @xmath11 is referred to as the pomeron flux factor and @xmath12 is the gluon density of the pomeron , where @xmath13 is the fractional momentum of the pomeron carried by the gluon .",
    "similar expressions exist for the subleading exchange which we generically refer to as `` reggeon '' .",
    "we use the diffractive parton densities as extracted from diffractive deep inelastic scattering measurements by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the relevant subprocesses for di - photon production are shown in figure [ fig : gamgam ] .",
    "the hard subprocess is as in 6.1 @xcite .",

    "we require that @xmath15 for the diffractive cross - sections .",
    "the non - diffractive cross - section was generated using the 6.1 monte carlo and the diffractive cross - section was generated using the default parameters for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributions .",
    "the steep fall in the double diffractive cross - section with increasing higgs mass at the tevatron is due to the limited phase space for high mass resonance production forced by the requirement that @xmath15 .",
    "no such dramatic fall is present at lhc energies .",
    "the effect is visible in figure [ hgcs ] ( b ) , where we show the ratio of double diffractive to inclusive higgs production .",

    "both distributions were found to fit the h1 measurement of the diffractive structure function equally well , although measurements of diffractive dijet production at hera suggest that fit 2 is favoured @xcite .",

    "cdf measured the cross - section to be @xmath25 nb , a factor of approximately 10 lower than our result .",
    "we therefore estimate that the gap survival factor @xmath26 .",
    "this compares favourably with theoretical estimates @xcite .",
    "our final cross - section predictions including our estimate of the gap survival factor are shown in the column labelled @xmath27 .",
    "table 1 also contains our predictions for double diffractive di - photon production for three choices of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath4 cuts . due to the dominance of the quark initiated subprocess ,",

    "double diffractive di - photon production , an interesting process in its own right , should be observable within the first year of tevatron run ii .",
    "the situation at the lhc is less clear , primarily due to the uncertainty in the gap survival factors at 14 tev .",
    "if @xmath32 is not much smaller than that at the tevatron , then we would expect of order 10 events per @xmath30 for @xmath19 gev , which is a sufficiently high rate to see a signal if the background can be controlled .",
