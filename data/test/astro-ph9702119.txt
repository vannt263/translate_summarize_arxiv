    "cal  87 is one of the prototypical members of the new class of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) which exhibit luminous ` supersoft ' emission .",
    "the supersoft sources ( ssss ) are characterised by their essential absence of emission above @xmath3kev , and extremely high luminosities ( l@xmath410@xmath5  ergs@xmath6 ) , of the order of the eddington limit for a 1m@xmath7 accretor .",
    "the original ssss , cal  83 and cal  87 , were first detected in the large magellanic cloud in 1979 - 1980 with the _ einstein _ x - ray observatory ( long , helfand & grabelsky , 1981 ) .",
    "these systems exhibit the characteristic hallmarks of lmxbs , namely blue continua with strong emission lines of heii  4686 and h@xmath8 ( e.g.  crampton et al .",
    "1987 ; pakull et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "_ rosat _ observations have shown the ssss to comprise a range of objects , including a planetary nebula nucleus ( wang 1991 ) and symbiotic systems ( e.  g.  hasinger 1994 ) , although the cal  83 type binaries are distinguished by the highest ( near eddington - limited ) luminosities . although theories of black hole ( cowley et al .",
    "1990 ) and neutron star accretors ( greiner , hasinger & kahabka 1991 ; kylafis & xilouris 1993 ) have been invoked for the latter systems , the most popular model involves a white dwarf undergoing stable nuclear surface burning ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "this has received observational confirmation in at least one system , rx  j0513.9 - 6951 , which exhibits a collimated bipolar outflow ( crampton et al .",
    "1996 ; southwell et al .",
    "the observed jet velocities are of the order of @xmath9kms@xmath6 , which corresponds to the escape velocity of a white dwarf .",
    "hence the nature of the accretor is established in at least one sss ( see e.  g.  livio 1997 ) .",
    "the required accretion rates are high ( @xmath10  yr@xmath6 ) , and thus require a donor star more massive than the white dwarf , in order to sustain thermally unstable mass transfer .",
    "cal  87 has been optically identified with a @xmath11 mag blue star in the lmc ( pakull et al .",
    "optical photometry revealed the system to be eclipsing , with an orbital period of 10.6h ( callanan et al .",
    "1989 ; schmidtke et al .",
    "although cowley et al .  ( 1990 ) proposed the accretor to be a black hole from an analysis of the heii  4686 velocities , this identification is highly questionable , particularly since accretion disc winds may bias the measurements ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "recently , schandl , meyer - hofmeister & meyer ( 1996 ) were able to successfully model the gross features of the optical light curve , assuming the model of van den heuvel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "we present here the results of @xmath2  years of optical monitoring of the source , the most extended coverage of this system to date .",
    "these observations were acquired as a by - product of the macho project ( alcock et al .",
    "1995a ) , owing to the serendipitous location of cal  87 in a surveyed field ( see also alcock et al .",
    "furthermore , we have acquired high speed white light photometry of a single eclipse , enabling us to investigate the detailed structure .",
    "the macho observations were made using the @xmath12-m telescope at mount stromlo observatory , australia .",
    "a dichroic beamsplitter and filters provide simultaneous ccd photometry in two passbands , a ` red ' band ( @xmath13   ) and a ` blue ' band ( @xmath14   ) . the latter filter is approximately equivalent to the johnson @xmath15 passband ( see alcock et al .",
    "1995a for further details ) .",
    "the images were reduced with the standard macho photometry code sodophot , based on point - spread function fitting and differential photometry relative to bright neighbouring stars .",
    "further details of the instrumental set - up and data processing may be found in alcock et al .  1995b ,",
    "marshall et al .",
    "1994 and stubbs et al .",
    "the high - speed white light observations were made on 28/1/96 , using the saao 1.9  m telescope at sutherland , south africa .",
    "the detector was the uct ccd , operating in frame transfer mode . in this configuration",
    ", only half of the chip is exposed , and at the end of the integration , the signal is read out through the masked half . in this way , we are able to obtain consecutive integrations with virtually no ccd dead time . the effective wavelength of the instrument , in the absence of a filter , is approximately that of the johnson @xmath15 passband , but with a bandwidth of @xmath16  ( fwhm ) .",
    "we initially used 10  s integrations , but later increased the exposure time to 20  s , to obtain better signal - to - noise .",
    "the images were reduced using the profile - fitting technique implemented in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "we show in fig .  1 the folded blue and red light curves .",
    "each passband comprises 495 observations acquired from 1992  aug  1996",
    "may , averaged into 50 phase bins .",
    "we use the ephemeris @xmath0 hjd @xmath17 for the time of minimum light ( see sec .  4 ) and an orbital period of @xmath18  d ( see sec .  3.2 below ) .",
    "one - sigma error bars are shown and we plot two cycles for clarity .",
    "the absolute calibration of the macho fields and transformation to standard passbands is not yet complete , thus only the relative magnitudes are plotted .",
    "we note that the light from cal87 is contaminated by two field stars which lie within @xmath19 away , and have recently been classified through hst observations as early - g and late - a type stars ( deutsch et al .",
    "the seeing at mount stromlo observatory did not allow us to resolve these contaminants , thus the macho light curves include the contributions from these stars .",
    "the principal features of the light curves are the deep , extended primary eclipse and shallower secondary dip at @xmath20 ( phase zero is defined as inferior conjunction of the donor star ) . during the primary eclipse ,",
    "the contaminant stars contribute @xmath21 of the total light in @xmath15 and @xmath22 ( deutsch et al .",
    "thus , we do not see the full eclipse depth of cal  87 since , at primary minimum , the light is dominated by the contribution of the contaminant stars .",
    "for example , in the blue light curve of fig .  1 , we see a primary eclipse depth of @xmath23  mag , compared with an expected intrinsic amplitude of 1.57  mag ( deutsch et al .",
    "the optical observations of cowley et al .",
    "( 1991 ) included a deblended @xmath15 light curve with a primary eclipse depth of @xmath24  mag ; this is consistent with the fact that one of the contaminant stars is not resolvable on their ground - based images , and was thus still contributing to the measured light .    despite these contaminants , the light curve _ structure _ is unaffected .",
    "the extended ingress of the primary eclipse is probably due to obscuration by an accretion disc bulge ( e.  g.  callanan et al .",
    "1989 ) , since the secondary itself could not occult the hot inner disc regions at phases @xmath25 . following the initial decline , which begins at @xmath26",
    ", there is a ` shoulder ' in the ingress throughout phases @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , during the primary eclipse egress , we see marginal evidence for a step at @xmath28 . however , these features are far more obvious in our high speed light curve ( fig .  5 ) ,",
    "thus we reserve a discussion for sec .  4 .",
    "a secondary dip is observed in both blue and red light curves at @xmath20 . in both cases ,",
    "the amplitude of the dip is around 0.2  mag ( we see the full intrinsic effect since , at this phase , the light from cal  87 dominates the contaminants ) . a likely cause of the secondary dips is obscuration of the irradiated face of the donor star ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) , although callanan et al .",
    "( 1989 ) favour an explanation in terms of a second accretion disc bulge , which occults the hot , inner disc regions .",
    "in order to investigate the stability of the eclipse structure , we divided the data into four sections , each representing approximately one year s worth of data .",
    "these red and blue light curves are shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "we see no significant changes in the overall morphology in either set of light curves during @xmath2  y from 1992 - 1996 ; furthermore , if we consider the data of schmidtke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and callanan et al .",
    "( 1989 ) the stability may be extended back to @xmath29 .",
    "however , we do note that the step in the egress at @xmath28 sometimes seems more pronounced , particularly in the blue data of 1993 - 1994 ( see sec .  4 for an explanation ) .",
    "we performed a power spectrum analysis on the red and blue datasets .",
    "a lomb - scargle ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) analysis indicated an orbital period of @xmath30  d , consistent with previous measurements ( schmidtke et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , combining our ephemeris ( see sec .",
    "4 ) with that of schmidtke et al .  ( 1993 ) allows us to derive an improved orbital period of @xmath31  d. a period analysis of each dataset failed to reveal any significant change in the orbital period over the four years of monitoring . from a consideration of the accuracy with which we are able to determine the period from four years of data",
    ", we derive an upper limit for the magnitude of any orbital period changes of @xmath32 .",
    "this may be used to obtain an approximate upper limit on the mass transfer rate ( e.  g.  robinson et al .",
    "1991 ) , by assuming the main sequence mass - radius relation for the secondary ( e.  g.  echevarra 1983 ) , an equivalent volume roche lobe radius relation ( paczyski 1971 ) and kepler s law . however , we find that the constraint on @xmath33 is not stringent enough to yield a particularly useful result .",
    "we find an approximate upper limit on @xmath34 of @xmath35  yr@xmath6 , which merely indicates that the accretion rate is sub - eddington .      as discussed in sec .",
    "3.1 , the macho light curves represent the blended light of cal87 and the contaminant stars",
    ". however , the spectral types of these stars are sufficiently early that they have a virtually negligible effect on the orbital @xmath36 colour variation of cal87 .",
    "to demonstrate this , we plot the relative @xmath36 colour , folded on the orbital period , as a function of orbital phase in fig .  4 .",
    "we see a pronounced reddening of @xmath37  mags during the primary eclipse . however , we can be confident that this is not simply due to the changing contribution of the contaminant stars , since deutsch et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have quantified the effect .",
    "they observed the colour change during primary eclipse for both intrinsic and blended light curves , finding that the amplitude differed by only @xmath38  mags between the two cases .",
    "therefore , since we see a much larger effect , we conclude that this is an intrinsic variation which is consistent with the occultation of a hot , blue inner disc . our value may be compared with the change found by deutsch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) of 0.21  mag in the blended @xmath36 colour .",
    "there is also marginal evidence for a slight reddening centred on @xmath39 .",
    "this may be caused by the partial obscuration of the inner disc or the heated face of the donor star , although it is not clear whether the phase delay of 0.05 , compared with the time of secondary minima in fig .  1",
    ", is significant .",
    "we note that previous optical @xmath15-band observations ( callanan et al .  1989 ;",
    "cowley et al .   1990 ; schmidtke et al .  1993 ) indicate that the phase of the secondary minima in the optical light curves may be slightly variable ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the reddening throughout the primary eclipse is @xmath41 times greater than in the dip at @xmath39 , although we stress that the latter may not be significant .",
    "indeed , we find no explanation for the apparently anomalous data points at @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we show in fig .  5 the ` real time ' white light curve obtained from the saao observations .",
    "we plot the white light counts relative to a local standard , although the absence of a filter prevents us from making an absolute calibration ( the light is also blended with the contaminant stars ) .",
    "the errors on the data points are @xmath44 counts , but rise for @xmath45 ( these observations were made during morning twilight ) .",
    "we note a decrease in the scatter of the light curve for @xmath46 , when we switched from 10  s to 20  s integrations .",
    "however , it is also possible that we are seeing a visible contribution from the diminished effects of flickering as the disc is eclipsed , a phenomenon commonly observed in cataclysmic variables ( see e.  g.  warner 1995 ) .",
    "the time of minimum light was derived by fitting a parabola to the most symmetrical part of the eclipse centre ( @xmath47 ) , and is found to be @xmath0 hjd @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed morphology of the eclipse structure reveals several interesting features . in fig .  5",
    ", we see an obvious shoulder in the ingress at @xmath48 , which is also apparent in the macho light curves of fig .  1",
    "( see also callanan et al .",
    "1989 ; cowley at el .",
    "the origin of this feature may probably be understood in terms of the variable obscuration by the thickened accretion disc rim .",
    "recently , armitage & livio ( 1996 ) have performed three - dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of accretion discs in lmxbs .",
    "in particular , they compute the column density profile towards the primary for a system inclination of @xmath49 , which is probably appropriate for cal  87 ( schandl , meyer - hofmeister & meyer 1996 ) .",
    "they find a strong peak centred on @xmath50 , which has declined by @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the gradient of our light curve ingress appears to be qualitatively consistent with these model calculations , being steepest at the phase of maximum obscuration ( @xmath50 ) , but levelling off as the column density declines towards @xmath52 .",
    "the rapid decline in the luminosity for @xmath53 presumably occurs as the donor star itself begins to obscure our line of sight .    within the deepest part of the primary eclipse ( @xmath54 ) , we see suggestions of further structure at @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ". however , it is not clear that we can attach any physical significance to these points , given the accuracy of the data , and further observations are scheduled in order to investigate the repeatability of these features .",
    "nevertheless , a very clear variation is observed in the egress for @xmath57 . in this respect ,",
    "the light curve of cal  87 is reminiscent of certain eclipsing cataclysmic variables ( e.  g.  z  cha ; cook & warner 1984 ) . in the latter system",
    ", a marked turn - over is observed in the eclipse egress after the emergence of the primary star ; then , following a short delay , the light curve rises again .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the emergence of a ` hot spot , ' a highly luminous region on the disc rim caused by the accretion stream / disc interaction . in cal  87",
    ", an analogous component may be the strongly irradiated inner - surface of the accretion disc bulge .",
    "indeed , schandl , meyer - hofmeister and meyer ( 1996 ) note that the existence of such a component is consistent with the fact that the luminosity is greater following an eclipse",
    ". the macho light curves of fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 suggest that this feature is at some times more pronounced than others ( see sec .",
    "this is probably not surprising , if indeed we are seeing the emergence of a variably irradiated region .",
    "we find the light curve of cal  87 to be essentially stable over a four year period from 1992 - 1996 , with an overall morphology consistent with earlier observations .",
    "we resolve structure in the primary eclipse at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these features are consistent with the presence of an accretion disc bulge , with a bright , irradiated inner surface .",
    "the orbital @xmath36 colour shows a pronounced reddening at primary eclipse and a probable smaller effect at @xmath39 , due to the obscuration of the primary / inner disc regions and the irradiated donor star respectively .",
    "we derive an improved orbital period of @xmath58  d , finding no evidence for a significant change in @xmath59 years .",
