    "it is now possible to make timing observations of millisecond pulsars to a precision of @xmath0100ns .",
    "one of the most exciting applications of such data - sets is to search for the signatures of gravitational waves passing over the earth .",
    "this is a major goal of the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project @xcite , which aims to observe 20 millisecond pulsars with a timing precision close to 100ns over more than five years .",
    "many phenomena can affect the pulse arrival times at this level of timing precision .",
    "a major contributor at our primary observing frequency of @xmath01400mhz is the interstellar and interplanetary medium @xcite . a small change in a pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ; the integrated electron density along the line of sight to the pulsar ) can cause significant time delays in the pulse arrival times .",
    "for example , at an observing frequency of 1400mhz , a time delay of 100ns is caused by a dm variation of only @xmath1@xmath2pc . at this level ,",
    "the solar wind effect is significant when the line of sight to the pulsar passes within @xmath060@xmath3 of the sun .    the standard pulsar timing programs ( tempo1 and tempo2 ; see hobbs , edwards & manchester 2006 , edwards , hobbs & manchester 2006 ) calculate the solar contribution , @xmath4",
    ", from a spherically symmetric model of the solar wind density which assumes a quadratic decrease with solar distance and ignores temporal variation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron density at @xmath7  au from the sun ( in @xmath2 ) and @xmath8 is the pulsar - sun - observatory angle . by default",
    ", tempo2 chooses @xmath9  @xmath2 whereas tempo1 uses @xmath10  @xmath2 .",
    "however , the true electron density of the solar wind can change with longitude , latitude and time by a factor of at least four @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this simple model is inadequate for psr  j1022 + 1001 , a pulsar that lies close to the ecliptic plane .",
    "there have been several previous analyses of the timing delays or dm variations due to the solar wind that occur in pulsar timing observations .",
    "for instance , the ecliptic latitude ( @xmath11 ) of the crab pulsar is only @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite showed , using a few observations within @xmath13 of the sun , that the maximum time delay due to the solar wind was about 500@xmath14s at 610 mhz .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the dm changed by @xmath15 when the line of sight to psr  b0950 + 08 ( @xmath16 ) is close to the sun .",
    "@xcite observed psr  b1821@xmath1724 between the years 1989 and 1993 and showed that between december and january each year their timing residuals were significantly affected by the solar corona .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite analysed data of psrs  j1713 + 0747 and j0030 + 0451 using the tempo1 model , but , instead of holding the electron density at 1au fixed , they fitted for this scaling factor .",
    "they obtained that @xmath18@xmath2 and @xmath19@xmath2 respectively .",
    "@xcite argued that the planetary companions to psr  b1257 + 12 @xcite were artefacts of incorrectly modelling the solar wind .",
    "the closest planet to the pulsar produces a 25.3d periodicity in the timing residuals which is remarkably close to periodicities seen in pioneer 10 spacecraft data which are thought to be due to patterns in the solar wind caused by the sun s rotation . even though wolszczan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proved that the periodicity was due to planetary companions ( based on the use of the original tempo1 solar - wind model and multi - frequency observations ) it is of interest to understand the effect of an unmodelled ( or poorly modelled ) solar wind on the measured pulsar parameters .",
    "recently , @xcite observed psrs  j1801@xmath172304 , j1757@xmath172421 , j1757@xmath172223 and j1822@xmath172256 when their lines of sight were close to the sun .",
    "their work has some overlap with ours as they also used observations from the wilcox solar observatory and a model for the solar electron density .",
    "however , they concentrated on variations in pulsar rotation measures due to the solar magnetic field . in our work",
    "we model variations in pulsar dispersion measures and describe their implications for high precision pulsar timing .    in this paper",
    "we first describe a two - state solar wind model (  [ sec : swm ] ) and our analysis technique (  [ sec : data ] ) before considering the implications for high precision pulsar timing (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the solar wind is a complex system and important features are still poorly understood .",
    "a summary of the relevent physics can be found in @xcite . in brief , the solar wind can be thought of as having a quasi - static component which is bimodal and co - rotates with the sun , and a transient component which has a time scale of hours to days .",
    "the best known of the transient events are coronal mass ejections , which typically cross any given line of sight about 5% of the time @xcite .",
    "it is currently not feasible to model the complex transient events and we will concentrate on modeling the co - rotating wind structure , which has `` fast '' and `` slow '' components .",
    "the slow wind has a relatively high density and apparently originates in or around active regions of closed magnetic geometry at low or middle latitudes .",
    "the fast wind has lower density and originates in regions with open magnetic field geometry called coronal holes .",
    "large coronal holes are located over the solar poles during the years of minimum solar activity .",
    "smaller and shorter - lived coronal holes occur at middle and low latitudes when solar activity is higher .",
    "we note that original tempo1 model can be thought of assuming that the entire wind is a spherically symmetric slow wind , whereas the default tempo2 model assumes that the wind is entirely fast .",
    "the electron density in the fast wind can be estimated from _",
    "ulysses _ and _ spartan _ observations to give : @xmath20 at a distance of @xmath21 solar radii @xcite .    we can approximate the electron density in the `` slow wind '' using a combination of the muhleman & anderson ( 1981 ) model fit to their own observations far from the sun and the `` baumbach - allen '' model near to the sun ( allen 1947 ) , @xmath22    in order to determine dm@xmath23 the electron density must be integrated along the line of sight to the pulsar",
    ". information on whether a given position along the line of sight will be within the slow or the fast wind can be obtained from the wilcox solar observatory . to obtain data - sets suitable for tempo2",
    "the classicss map should be selected with a latitude projection .",
    "full details can be obtained from the tempo2 on - line documentation ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2 ) . ] which provides daily maps of the solar magnetic field since may 1976 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the slow wind occupies the zone within 20@xmath3 of the magnetic neutral line and outside this is dominated by the fast wind and that both winds flow radially . to demonstrate our technique we show , in figure  [ fg : synoptic ] , a synoptic chart showing the projection of the line of sight on to the sun for psr  j1744@xmath171134 on the 20th december 2004 .",
    "as expected , this figure shows that some parts of the line of sight lie within the slow wind and some within the fast wind .",
    "we use observations obtained for the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project @xcite to test our new model .",
    "a sample of 20 millisecond pulsars has been observed since february 2004 at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks at frequencies around 700mhz , 1400mhz and 3100mhz .",
    "details of the observations and the methods used to determine the dm variations are given by @xcite .",
    "for this paper we use data for four pulsars which have measurable dm variations due to the solar wind .",
    "psrs  j1022 + 1001 and j1730@xmath172304 have ecliptic latitudes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively and hence are eclipsed by the sun each year .",
    "psrs  j1744@xmath171134 and j1909@xmath173744 have higher ecliptic latitudes ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) but can be timed with very high precision .",
    "we have implemented algorithms into tempo2 to integrate the electron density along a given line of sight assuming the fast- and slow - wind electron densities as given in equations  [ eqn : nefast ] and [ eqn : neslow ] . for every observation",
    ", tempo2 calculates the projection of points along the line of sight to the pulsar on to the surface of the sun , assuming the carrington rotation rate and a mean wind velocity of 400kms@xmath28 .",
    "these parameters are characteristic of the slow wind and are chosen since this component dominates both the wind dynamics and the dispersion contribution . using data from the wilcox solar observatory , tempo2 determines the position of the magnetic neutral line and , hence , the regions along the line of sight that are within the slow and fast winds . a numerical integration",
    "is then carried out to obtain the total electron column density of the solar wind along the line of sight and hence @xmath4 .",
    "the derived values are not significantly dependent upon our assumptions about the wind rotation and velocity .",
    "tools are available within the tempo2 software to obtain such synopotic charts for any pulsar on any day since the start of the wilcox solar observatory data in 1976 .",
    "figure  [ fg : dms ] shows the dm variations according to our solar wind model for psr  j1744@xmath171134 between the years 2004 and 2006 .",
    "the predictions according to the earlier tempo1 and tempo2 models are also indicated in the figure .",
    "we notice that the new model generally predicts dm values that are higher than the tempo2 model , but lower than the tempo1 model as expected from our two - state model .",
    "the new model is also not smooth .",
    "variations of up to dm@xmath29@xmath2pc occur on a daily basis .",
    "differences between measured dm@xmath23 values @xcite and the predictions using the original and new tempo2 models are shown in figure  [ fg : compare ] for the four pulsar datasets discussed in this paper .",
    "this figure shows that , for lines of sight that pass close to the sun , the original tempo2 does not correctly predict dm@xmath23 .",
    "however , the improved model predicts dm@xmath23 within experimental uncertainties for all observations .",
    "our data - sets are currently poorly sampled for lines of sight that pass close to the sun .",
    "we have , therefore , compared our improved model predictions with observations of psr  b1821@xmath1724 using the nanay radio telescope @xcite .",
    "dm values were measured from their figure  7 .",
    "there appear to be significant non - solar variations in their measured dms and we have removed a straight line fitted to the values more than @xmath30 from the sun .",
    "comparisons with the original tempo2 model and our improved model are shown in the right hand column of figure  [ fg : compare ] .",
    "it is clear that the new model is a significant improvement over the previous tempo2 model .",
    "however , even with our improved model there are some observations that are not consistent with our predictions .",
    "these inconsistencies occur at the closest approach of the line of sight to the sun . at such close approaches",
    "our simple assumptions of the two - component wind model where the slow wind lies within 20@xmath3 of the magnetic neutral line and radial wind flow with projection along mean flow streamlines may not be valid .",
    "we will be able to further test our model with future ppta datasets having more precise and more closely sampled dm measurements at close angular distances to the sun .",
    "such results should help us to further improve the model .",
    "modern pulsar timing experiments are aiming to achieve rms timing precisions close to 100  ns over many years . at an observing frequency of 1.4  ghz",
    "the solar wind causes time delays of this magnitude for pulsars up to 60@xmath3 from the sun and significant deviations between the original and improved tempo2 models occur at @xmath31 from the sun .    in order to study the effect of an unmodelled , or poorly modelled , solar wind on pulsar timing parameters we used tempo2 to create simulated data - sets spanning three years for psr  j1744@xmath171134 . for these simulations we applied the improved solar - wind model and a specified amount of uncorrelated pulsar timing noise .",
    "we then either switched off all solar wind models or used the original tempo2 model before fitting for the pulsar s parameters .",
    "deviations from the true values for various astrometric parameters are listed in table  [ tb : diffparams ] .",
    "clearly , the solar - wind model has a large effect on the values of the fitted parameters .",
    "for instance , for 100ns rms timing residuals , the derived values for parallax and declination when using the standard tempo2 model deviate by @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively from their true values .",
    "for any given pulsar , the error in each parameter will depend upon the rms timing residual , the data - span and the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar .",

    "as we have no access to the original wolszczan ( 1994 ) data - set , our simulated observations are uniformly sampled .",
    "a power spectrum of the solar wind contribution was computed with a rectangular window using the lomb - scargle algorithm .",
    "since the data are uniformly sampled this is the same as the normal fourier power spectrum .",
    "this spectrum , shown in the top panel of figure  [ fg : pspectrum ] , is dominated by harmonics of the annual modulation . to reduce the leakage of annual harmonics into the higher frequencies we removed the annual feature by subtracting a fit of a spherically symmetric model ( equation  [ eqn : model ] ) to the residuals . the resulting spectrum is shown in the middle panel .",
    "there is no significant feature in either spectrum corresponding to the narrow 25.3-d peak seen in solar wind observations by scherer et al .",
    "in fact we do not expect to see a sharp feature in the spectrum because the line of sight to the pulsar changes significantly during a solar rotation and the solar wind density itself evolves on that time scale .",
    "we have used tempo2 to introduce the expected signal from the planet and applied the same spectral analysis to the combined solar wind plus planet simulation . the resulting spectrum is plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "the contribution of the planet exceeds the solar wind noise by a factor of more than 100 .",
    "clearly scherer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) seriously overestimated the importance of solar noise in the detection of a planet around psr  b1257@xmath3512 .",
    "we have developed a new solar - wind model for pulsar timing experiments and shown that it gives a more accurate correction for delays due to the solar wind than earlier models .",
    "use of the older solar - wind models ( or no correction ) leads to systematic errors in measured pulsar parameters .",
    "we have also shown that the solar wind can not mimic the signal from inner - most planetary companion of psr b1257 + 12 as suggested by scherer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with the improved pulsar timing data expected in the future from projects such as the parkes pulsar timing array , use of the new model will make an important contribution to achieving the goals of these projects .",
