    "galaxies believed to be responsible for damped ly@xmath8 absorption ( dla ) systems in the spectra of high - redshift quasars represent a viable population of progenitors of normal disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that they represent still merging , gas - rich protogalactic clumps , rather than already formed disks .",
    "they appear to contain a substantial fraction of the baryons known to exist in normal galaxies today @xcite .",
    "dla systems represent an already well - established , _ large population _ of high-@xmath9 objects for which the confusion with agn does not arise .",
    "the crucial question is whether dla systems represent a population of already assembled massive proto - disks , as advocated , e.g. , by wolfe and collaborators , or whether they are still subgalactic fragments in the process of hierarchical assembly , as favored by many n - body simulators @xcite . in order to answer this question , it is essential to obtain firm optical identifications of objects responsible for the dla absorption , and to determine their physical properties",
    ".    direct imaging of dla galaxies can provide measurements of their luminosities . from their separation from the qso line of sight",
    ", one can infer their physical sizes .",
    "coupled with the spectroscopic measurements of velocity fields in these systems , one can deduce their dynamical masses .",
    "sizes and h i column densities give the gas masss .",
    "star formation rates can be obtained from the uv continuum luminosity , and from the ly@xmath8 line emission , if present .    clustered",
    "companions of dla systems , all containing agn , or quasar companions which may be responsible for some associated absorption have been seen in several cases @xcite , but until recently no normal , isolated dla systems themselves . warren & moller",
    "@xcite found emission - line regions associated with a radio - loud quasar pks 0528250 at @xmath10 , which also has an associated dla system .",
    "the relation of these emission - line objects with the absorber is not clear ; yet ly@xmath8 companions of radio - loud quasars have been seen in many cases .",
    "the whole point of studying dla galaxies is to get away from systems dominated by agn , by selecting isolated , field objects . even if there are dla systems associated with quasars , their utility for the purpose of understanding of formation of normal disk galaxies is rather uncertain .",
    "we discovered for the first time a galaxy responsible for a known , isolated dla system at @xmath11 in the spectrum of a quasar 2233 + 131 @xcite .",
    "its observed physical properties and the derived sfr correspond closely to what may be expected of a young disk galaxy still in the process of formation : no spectroscopic evidence for an agn , luminosity @xmath12 , inferred star formation rate ( both from the ly@xmath8 line and the uv continuum ) sfr @xmath13/yr , a physical size ( from the separation of the absorber portion in the front of the qso and the counterpart galaxy emission ) of @xmath14 kpc in the restframe , and a velocity field with an amplitude of @xmath15 km / s .",
    "these properties are exactly what may be expected from a young , massive disk galaxy .",
    "since then , we have stared a systematic search for more such high-@xmath9 dla counterparts at the w.m .",
    "keck telescope .",
    "so far , we have found a several candidates , most of which still require more spectroscopy .",
    "typically , these galaxies have @xmath16 and no strong line emission , in agreement with the results found for the field lyman - break galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most interesting case so far ( figure 1 ) is a possible counterpart of a dla system at @xmath17 , seen in the spectrum of the quasar dms 22470209 ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "the object is an @xmath19 galaxy seen 3.3 arcsec in projection from the qso l.o.s .",
    "( corresponding to @xmath20 comoving kpc , or @xmath21 proper kpc at the absorber redshift , for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "weak ly@xmath8 emission line ( figure 2 ) is detected at @xmath24 .",
    "its inferred continuum luminosity is @xmath25 , and the sfr @xmath26/yr . in other words",
    ", we can now study nearly dwarf galaxies at @xmath27 ! of course , its low luminosity and sfr may be indicative of its extreme youth , rather than its mass .    to summarize , direct galaxy counterparts of dla systems at @xmath28 have been found .",
    "their typical magnitudes are @xmath29 , with separations from the qso l.o.s .",
    "@xmath30 arcsec ( the inner limit is due to the seeing ) . for a reasonable range of cosmological parameters ,",
    "the corresponding luminosities are @xmath1 , star formation rates ( determined from both the uv coninuum luminosity and from the ly@xmath8 emission line ) are @xmath31 a few @xmath3/yr , and the projected physical sizes are @xmath4 kpc . along with the typical observed velocity fields of @xmath32 km / s ,",
    "this implies dynamical masses @xmath5 .",
    "these preliminary results support the idea that dla systems represent likely progenitors of normal disk galaxies today .",
    "the populations of dla systems , of which dla 2233 + 131 and dla 2247021 may be representative , and of lyman - break objects studied by steidel and others @xcite may overlap considerably , and they may be tentatively identified as progenitors of typical normal ( disk ? ) galaxies today .    intriguingly , we have found a significant excess ( a 7-@xmath33 effect ) of apparently foreground galaxies near the lines of sight to luminous quasars at @xmath6 , which may be also correlated with the apparent luminosity of the qso @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopy of these galaxies so far shows that nearly all are foreground objects , typically at @xmath34 , although at least a few are quasar companions at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that gravitational ( micro)lensing may be systematically affecting our inferred luminosities of these objects .",
    "this result may have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of the quasar luminosity function @xcite , as well as the evolution of the high - redshift absorbers seen in their spectra @xcite : both the abundance of high - luminosity quasars and the comoving density of h i in dla s at high redshifts would be overestimated . however ,",
    "if a population of optically thick lenses / absorbers exists , that would have the opposite effect @xcite ."
