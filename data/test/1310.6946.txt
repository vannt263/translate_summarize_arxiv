    "extensions to more than one lane , lane changing , discrete models , higher order effects , as well as numerical work , prevail .",
    "one of the original authors has found a toda lattice like solution to the discrete version of newell @xcite , see @xcite . in a future paper",
    ", we will see if the methods introduced here can be applied to some of these recent extensions of lwrp and lwr .",
    "other models have been developed @xcite , and @xcite@xcite . however ,",
    "here we will concentrate on lwrp , remembering that any progress here may have implications for other physical problems , such as gas dynamics .",
    "assume a long segment of a one lane road , deprived of entries and exits , only moderately congested by traffic and free of breakdowns admitting a continuous treatment , so as to permit us to postulate the usual equation of continuity : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the density of cars , the maximum of which @xmath3 corresponds to a bumper to bumper situation never occurring on our present model , and @xmath4 is the local velocity .",
    "the right hand side of the second , newtonian equation , formulated by payne @xcite and whitham @xcite , is less obvious : @xmath5 the first term on the right involves the mean drivers reaction time @xmath6 , and the next term models a diffusion effect depending on the drivers awareness of conditions beyond the preceding car .",
    "the constant @xmath7 is a parameter that models the effect of gradients on the acceleration .",
    "the choice of @xmath8 depends on the quality of the road .",
    "an obvious solution is @xmath2 and @xmath9 both constant .",
    "whitham considers this solution in his book and finds that is stable @xcite .    in part",
    "i @xmath8 was a linearly decreasing function of @xmath2 : @xmath10 where the constant @xmath11 is related to @xmath3 by @xmath12 in this paper the analysis will be restricted to @xmath13 for which one can approximate @xmath8 by @xmath14 . in this connection",
    "we specify @xmath15 this is a form of @xmath8 recently postulated for low density and high quality of the road @xcite@xcite .    the model used in part i had most common sense properties .",
    "the flow of traffic @xmath16 increased from zero for zero density of cars , through a maximum above which traffic becomes congested so that increasing the density no - longer increases the flow , down to an extreme density preventing any motion .",
    "the flow against density curve was a continuous parabola .",
    "all this is well enough .",
    "however , this model can be improved on .",
    "when the distances between individual cars are long , increase of density only results in a linear increase in the flow . if you can not see the cars preceding and following you , a possible small increase in the car density will hardly be noticed .",
    "thus the flow is a linear function of the density .",
    "thus the left hand portion of @xmath8 should be a constant up to some @xmath17 and the flow is @xmath18 .",
    "calculations simplify as long as we stay away from @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 will depend on the quality of the road .",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables by replacing @xmath19 this leaves the continuity equation unchanged , and the newtonian equation takes the form : @xmath20 slightly simpler than in part i. here in part ii we treat situations that never become very congested ( @xmath13 ) which for the dimensionless quantities requires that @xmath21    our model is a macroscopic one in which the traffic is treated as a fluid flow .",
    "this is in contrast to the microscopic models involving motions of individual cars and hybrid models combining elements of both .",
    "( the reader who has read part i can proceed to section 3 . )",
    "the non - linearity on the left hand side of equations ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ momds ] ) can be eliminated by introducing lagrangian coordinates : @xmath22 , the initial position ( at @xmath23 ) of a fluid element which at time @xmath24 was at @xmath25 , and time @xmath24 . in this description ,",
    "the independent variable @xmath25 becomes a function of @xmath26 and @xmath24 , as are the fluid parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "here and in what follows we adopt the convention that a superposition of two functions which introduces a new variable is denoted by the same symbol as the original function , but of the new variable .",
    "denoting by @xmath29 either @xmath2 or @xmath4 , the basic transformation between eulerian coordinates @xmath0 and lagrangian ones @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 we denote by @xmath32 the number of cars between the last one at @xmath33 and that at @xmath26 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the initial mass density distribution .",
