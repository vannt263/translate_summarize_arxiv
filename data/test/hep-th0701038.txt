    "more recently , the stability of designer gravity theories has been studied using purely gravitational arguments . in particular ,",

    "an elegant way to prove energy bounds is witten s spinor method  @xcite , which proceeds by constructing a manifestly positive `` spinor charge , '' and then comparing it to the energy of the gravitational solution .",
    "witten s argument was originally given in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes , but it can be generalized to the asymptotically ads situation . when the matter satisfies the dominant energy condition apart from the negative cosmological constant term ( regarded as a contribution @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) , witten s argument may simply be modified by the addition of a term @xmath38 to the covariant derivative which acts on the spinor , where @xmath1 is a constant proportional to @xmath39 .",

    "however , the proof of @xcite requires that @xmath9 be well - defined ( and real ) for all @xmath40 , and this imposes further restrictions on @xmath10 .    in both the fast @xcite and slow fall - off cases",

    "the proof of @xcite is identical no matter which superpotential is used , and it is sufficient that only @xmath4 existboth @xmath4 and @xmath3 exist near @xmath14 .",
    "however , a real solution ceases to exist if ( [ vtop ] ) forces @xmath55 to become imaginary ; i.e. , if @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 near @xmath14 , and since this in turn implies @xmath58 , one finds @xmath59 for all @xmath60 and global existence of @xmath3 implies global existence of @xmath4 , but not vice versa . ]",
    ". however , in order to derive an energy bound with slower fall - off conditions , @xcite assumed the existence of @xmath3 .",

    "can be avoided by imposing the witten condition @xcite @xmath80 which is essentially the spatial dirac equation . in section  [ spinors ] , we recall the argument  @xcite that globally smooth spinors satisfying   with the above boundary conditions exist in designer gravity .",
    "this establishes @xmath81 .",
    "however , an energy bound can be derived only once we relate @xmath72 to the physical energy @xmath54 .",
    "while these coincide for fast fall - off boundary conditions , they differ in the slow fall - off case .",
    "one consequence of this is that @xmath72 is not in general conserved .",
    "another is that @xmath72 may now depend on whether the spinor charge is defined using @xmath4 or @xmath3 .",
    "that is , @xmath82 .    in  @xcite , the covariant phase space method of  @xcite , was used to show ( following @xcite ) that energy in designer gravity takes the form ) describes the generic case .",

    "choosing @xmath3 and using @xmath95 yields the bound @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the volume of the unit - radius @xmath26 . on the other hand , for @xmath98 choosing @xmath4 causes the final term in ( [ qew ] ) to diverge .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath0 are manifestly finite , it follows that @xmath99 is infinite .",
    "it is also infinitely larger than @xmath54 , and its positivity yields no lower bound on @xmath54 .",

    "we may terminate the expansion   at some large finite @xmath190 , thus obtaining a @xmath189 vanishing faster than @xmath191 .",
    "the next step is to obtain from the formal power series solution @xmath183 a global solution @xmath67 to the witten equation .",
    "this step requires some global analysis .",
    "the idea is to write the global solution @xmath67 that we seek as = + , where @xmath192 is a smooth spinor field to be determined .",
    "thus , @xmath192 should satisfy @xmath193 , and @xmath192 should vanish at least as fast as @xmath194 in order that @xmath67 have the same asymptotics as @xmath183 to leading order .",
    "the global existence of such a @xmath192 can be established using the following key inequality   which holds whenever @xmath195 is a solution to the einstein equations satisfying the asymptotic conditions given in @xcite . to state the inequality , consider any smooth spinor field @xmath196 on @xmath66 that vanishes outside some compact region in @xmath66 , and introduce the following norm on such @xmath196 : [ normu ] u ^2 = _ ds .",
    "then there exists a positive constant independent of @xmath196 such that [ ineq ] const.^-1 u ^2 _",
    "|l u|^2 ds u ^2 .",
    "the proof of the inequality uses a similar technique as in the `` hardy - inequality , '' combined with the key identity  .",
    "it may be found in  @xcite .",
    "we now use the inequality to establish a solution to the equation @xmath193 .",
    "we will do this by first constructing a distributional solution @xmath192 , and then showing that it is in fact smooth .",
    "let @xmath197 be the linear functional on smooth compactly supported spinors @xmath196 defined by f(u ) = -_(nj)^u ds , where @xmath198 , and @xmath76 is the unit timelike normal to @xmath66 . note that @xmath199 , and that [ hermitian ] n l^= l n due to the fact that @xmath178 . by the cauchy - schwartz inequality and the first half of the inequality  , we get |f(u)| & & ( _ |u|^2 ( 1+r^2)^-1 ds ) ^1/2 ( _ |j|^2 ( 1+r^2 ) ds ) ^1/2 + & & const .",
    "( _ |lu|^2 ds ) ^1/2 .",
    "the constant is finite because by construction @xmath189 drops off sufficiently rapidly at infinity .",
    "we interpret this inequality as saying that @xmath197 is a bounded functional with respect to the positive definite scalar product given by v | u = ( lv)^lu ds .",
    "let @xmath200 be the hilbert space defined by this inner product ( which , by the second half of inequality   is identical to the hilbert space obtained from the norm @xmath201 ) . by the riesz representation theorem , there is hence an element @xmath202 such that @xmath203 for all @xmath204 .",
    "again by the inequality  , every element in @xmath200 is locally square integrable , so in particular a distribution on @xmath66 .",
    "thus , @xmath205 is a solution in the distributional sense of the equation @xmath206 .",
    "next , we apply @xmath207 to this equation , use eq .  , and put @xmath208 .",
    "it follows that this @xmath192 is the desired distributional solution to @xmath193 , and @xmath209 is a global solution to the witten equation .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath67 is smooth , and that it satisfies the desired boundary conditions .",
    "this will follow if we can show that @xmath192 is smooth and vanishes sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "it follows from our construction so far only that @xmath210 .",
    "but since @xmath189 is smooth and vanishes quickly , one can now use the mapping properties of the parametrix of the operator @xmath175 established in  @xcite to prove that @xmath192 is indeed smooth and vanishes sufficiently fast .",
    "the details of this argument are given in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we outline how one might construct the desired @xmath178 slice @xmath66 in the type of spacetimes that we consider .",
    "first , let @xmath211 be any ( weakly ) spacelike hypersurface in spacetime , @xmath212 its domain of dependence .",
    "if @xmath211 is such that the closure of @xmath212 is contained in a globally hyperbolic subregion of spacetime ( note that the full spacetime need _ not _ be globally hyperbolic ) , then a theorem of bartnik  @xcite guarantees that there exists a sufficiently regular maximal slice @xmath66 with prescribed extrinsic curvature and boundary @xmath213 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not immediately clear how to apply this theorem when the surface @xmath211 touches the conformal boundary .",
    "however , by considering a sequence @xmath214 eventually touching the conformal boundary transversely , we obtain a corresponding sequence @xmath215 of maximal slices .",
    "presumably it can be shown that these have a subsequence that is convergent in a sufficiently strong sense .",
    "we now explicitly describe the solution to the witten equation for a slice @xmath66 which is both spherically symmetric and maximal ( i.e , @xmath178 ) though not necessarily static .",
    "such a slice automatically exists when the initial data are time - symmetric .",
    "since this case is sufficient to address the concerns of @xcite , we explain the analysis in some detail .",
    "our conventions will be as follows . for simplicity , we restrict attention in this subsection to the case @xmath41 .",
    "we denote by @xmath216 indices on a flat internal space ( while @xmath217 are spacetime indices ) .",
    "the gamma matrices satisfy @xmath218 and we choose the explicit matrix representation @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the @xmath221 identity matrix , and where @xmath222 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "we wish to address spherical spacetimes .",
    "let @xmath66 be a maximal ( @xmath178 ) , spherically symmetric spacelike slice on which we set @xmath223 , e.g. , a surface of time - symmetry .",
    "though such spacetimes are not in general static , on @xmath66 they may nevertheless be written in the form ( [ metric ] ) , which may be described by the orthonormal frame @xmath224 because @xmath178 , the witten equation   only depends on the geometry intrinsic to @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath225 .",
    "we further assume that the scalar field on @xmath66 is a function of @xmath94 alone , and that @xmath226 , @xmath227 are known functions .",
    "the intrinsic covariant derivative acting on spinor fields is in general given by @xmath228 where the intrinsic spin connection is determined by the relation @xmath229 .",

    "the @xmath244 are jacobi polynomials and the spherical harmonics satisfy @xmath245 separating variables as @xmath246 @xmath247 we find from  ( [ witcon31 ] ) and  ( [ witcon32 ] ) that the radial functions satisfy the following differential equations : @xmath248 @xmath249    to pick the desired solution to the witten equation , we now impose our boundary conditions .",
    "we demand that our solution be regular in the interior , and that it asymptotically approaches a suitable killing spinor @xmath70 of pure ads .",
    "as we will see shortly , this @xmath70 has only @xmath250 components .",
    "since the remaining modes are decoupled , they may be consistently set to zero .",

    "the solutions behave as @xmath252 where @xmath253 are constants .",

    "in particular , an explicit solution to the killing spinor equation is given by @xcite @xmath259 where @xmath260 is a constant spinor and @xmath261 the spinor @xmath260 is chosen so that @xmath70 satisfies the additional requirement @xmath262 , or equivalently @xmath263 .",
    "one can achieve this normalization by taking @xmath264 with the choice  ( [ norm ] ) , one can rewrite  ( [ ks ] ) in terms of the spinor spherical harmonics as @xmath265 hence , the solution for the witten spinor is @xmath266 \\end{array } \\right ) \\,.\\ ] ] furthermore , comparing to  ( [ ks2 ] ) we see that the asymptotic conditions on the radial functions are @xmath267    comparing ( [ wcasym ] ) and ( [ wcbc ] ) with ( [ near0 ] ) and ( [ largerr ] ) demonstrates that the desired witten spinors exist .",
    "one first notes that @xmath268 decouple from @xmath269 . to construct the desired @xmath268 , one simply enforces the boundary condition ( [ wcbc ] ) at @xmath144 for some @xmath270 and integrates ( [ radialde ] ) outward . from ( [ largerr ] ) ,",
    "any solution will grow asymptotically as @xmath258 , and in fact will satisfy ( [ wcasym ] ) up to an overall scale . rescaling @xmath270 yields the desired solutions @xmath268 .",
    "the analysis for @xmath271 is similar .",
    "thus , witten spinors exist for any spherically symmetric maximal hypersurface @xmath66 satisfying our boundary conditions .",
    "a final crucial aspect of the argument of section [ two ] is the detailed relation ( [ qew ] ) between the spinor charges @xmath52 and the energy @xmath54 .",
    "since ( [ qew ] ) was derived via a tedious calculation , it is useful to verify the relation numerically",
    ". let us consider the theory with potential @xmath272 which is just ( [ pot ] ) for @xmath273 .",
    "this theory admits both a @xmath4 and a @xmath3 superpotential .",
    "we take as initial data a soliton with @xmath274 and boundary condition @xmath275 for some constant @xmath276 ( so that @xmath0 is not conformally invariant ) .",
    "we find that a soliton exists with @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",

    "width=336 ]    using these solutions , we can also calculate the spinor charge and check  ( [ qew ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath284 , thus confirming the relation @xmath285 .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath4 case we find @xmath286 , in agreement with ( [ qew ] ) .",
    "we have resolved the puzzle raised in @xcite concerning energy bounds in designer gravity . while the arguments of @xcite are correct as written , global existence of an appropriate superpotential is a subtle requirement . in particular , two types of superpotentials may ( or may not ) exist for a given scalar potential @xmath10 .",
    "the proof of @xcite requires the global existence of a @xmath3-type superpotential .",
    "if one attempts to follow the same argument with a @xmath4-type superpotential , one finds that the difference between the conserved energy @xmath54 and the associated spinor charge @xmath99 diverges , and in particular that @xmath99 diverges .",
    "thus , positivity of @xmath99 does not yield a lower bound for @xmath54 , and the existence of a @xmath4-type superpotential alone is not sufficient to yield a positive energy theorem .",
    "numerical explorations support this resolution .    a specific question raised in @xcite concerned the global existence of witten spinors .",
    "we have demonstrated ( section [ spinors ] ) that no such difficulties arise , even for the models considered in @xcite .",
    "the existence theorem of @xcite was shown to hold in general and , for the special case of spherical symmetry , existence of witten spinors on maximal ( e.g. , time - symmetric ) hypersurfaces was again demonstrated using simple arguments based on ordinary differential equations .",
    "the spherical time - symmetric context is sufficient to address the concerns of @xcite .",
    "this reinforces our claim that , when @xmath0 has a global minimum , the existence of a @xmath3-type superpotential is sufficient for the energy to be bounded below .",
    "interestingly , our numerical explorations of particular examples ( section [ solitons ] ) suggest that global existence of @xmath3 may also be _ necessary _ for the energy to be bounded below",
    ". such a property would be analogous to the claim of @xcite that the existence of a superpotential is necessary for an energy bound to hold in the case of fast fall - off boundary conditions @xmath287 .",
    "however , in the fast fall - off case the relevant superpotential is @xmath4 , since either superpotential is sufficient and existence of @xmath3 implies existence of @xmath4 ( footnote [ exist ] ) . indeed , for @xmath32 the spinor charges @xmath52 satisfy @xmath288 and , in particular , @xmath289 when both potentials exist .",
    "thus we find that each type of superpotential provides a stability criterion for ads gravity - scalar theories , with @xmath4 controlling the @xmath32 case and @xmath3 controlling cases with slower fall - off conditions on the scalar .",
    "finally , a key tool in our investigation of particular examples was the argument from @xcite showing that the existence of designer gravity solitons satisfying ads - invariant boundary conditions implies that the energy is unbounded below .",
    "we may thus interpret the lower bounds of @xcite in terms of the soliton content of such theories .",
    "we conclude that designer gravity theories where @xmath3 exists can have no solitons when @xmath0 is both ads - invariant and bounded below .",
