    "the existence of highly - irradiated , gas - giants planets orbiting within @xmath6 au of their host stars , and the unexpected large radii of many of them , is an unresolved problem in the theory of planet formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "their prominence amongst the @xmath7 confirmed exoplanets is unsurprising ; their large radii , large masses , and short orbital periods make them readily accessible to ground - based transit and radial velocity surveys , on account of the comparatively large flux variations and reflex motions that they cause .",
    "exoplanet searches often focus on the detection of small earth - like exoplanets , but understanding the formation mechanism and evolution of the giant planets , particularly in the overlap mass regime with brown dwarfs , is a key question in astrophysics .",
    "this paper reports on wts-1b , the first planet discovery from the wfcam transit survey ( wts ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wts is the only large - scale ground - based transit survey that operates at near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the advantage of photometric monitoring at nir wavelengths is an increased sensitivity to photons from m - dwarfs ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) .",
    "these small stars undergo similar flux variations and reflex motions in the presence of an earth - like companion as solar - type stars do with hot jupiter companions . while a primary goal of the wts is the detection of terrestrial planets around cool stars , wts can also provide observational constraints on the mechanism for giant planet formation , by accurately measuring the hot jupiter fraction for m - dwarfs .",
    "the light curve quality of the wts is sufficient to reveal transiting super - earths around mid - m dwarfs @xcite , but scaling - up means that any hot jupiter companions to the @xmath1080000 fgk stars in the survey are also detectable .",
    "theoretical models of isolated giant planets predict an almost constant radius for pure h@xmath11he objects in the mass range @xmath12@xmath3  as a result of the equilibrium between the electron degeneracy in the core and the pressure support in the external gas layers @xcite .",
    "hence the larger radii of many hot jupiters ( hereafter hj ) must arise from other factors .",
    "due to the proximity of these planets to their host star , the irradiation of the surface of the planet is thought to play a major role in the so - called radius anomaly , by altering the thermal equilibrium and delaying the kelvin - helmholtz contraction of the planet from birth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is supported by a correlation between the mean planetary density and the incident stellar flux @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that this can not be the only explanation for the radius anomaly @xcite , and other sources must contribute to the large amount of energy required to keep gas giants radii above @xmath101.2@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of physical mechanisms thought to be responsible for radius inflation , including ( but not limited to ) : tidal heating due to the circularisation of close - in orbits @xcite , reduced heat loss due to enhanced opacities in the outer layers of the planetary atmosphere @xcite , double - diffusive convection leading to slower heat transportation @xcite , increased heating via ohmic dissipation in which ionised atoms interact with the planetary magnetic field as they move along strong atmospheric winds @xcite , and a slower cooling rate due to the mechanical greenhouse effect in which turbulent mixing drives a downwards flux of heat simulating a more intense incident irradiation @xcite .",
    "a radically different explanation has been proposed by @xcite who point out a correlation between radius anomaly and tidal decay timescale and suggest that inflated hjs are actually young because they have recently formed as a result of binary mergers . studying the radius anomaly in higher mass hjs ( @xmath13@xmath5 ) is useful as they are perhaps more resilient to atmospheric loss due to their larger roche lobe radius .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ wts_survey ] we briefly describe the strategy of the wfcam transit survey , while the photometric and spectroscopic observations are presented in section  [ photo_data ] along with their related data reduction .",
    "section  [ analysis ] describes how we characterized the host star ( section  [ star ] ) and determined the properties of the planet ( section  [ planet ] ) , using a combination of low- and high - resolution spectra and photometric follow - up observations . a discussion on the nature and the peculiarity of this new planet , our conclusions and further considerations are given in section  [ disc ] .",
    "throughout this paper we refer to the planet as wts-1b , and to the parent star and the whole star - planet system as wts-1 .",
    "the wts is an on - going photometric monitoring campaign using the wide field camera ( wfcam ) on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) at mauna kea , hawaii , and has been in operation since august 2007 .",
    "ukirt is a 3.8-m telescope , designed solely for nir observations and operated in queue - scheduled mode .",
    "the survey was awarded 200 nights of observing time , of which @xmath1050@xmath14 has been observed to - date , and runs primarily as a back - up program when observing conditions are not optimal for the main ukidss programs ( seeing @xmath15 arcsec ) .",
    "the survey targets four 1.6 deg@xmath16 fields , distributed seasonally in right ascension at 03 , 07 , 17 and 19 hours to allow year - round visibility .",
    "wts-1b is located in the 19 hour field ( hereafter 19hr ) .",
    "the fields are close to the galactic plane but have @xmath17 degrees to avoid over - crowding and high reddening .",
    "the exact locations were chosen to maximise the number of m - dwarfs , while keeping giant contamination at a minimum and maintaining an @xmath18 . due to the back - up nature of the program ,",
    "observations of a given field are randomly distributed throughout a given night , but on average occur in a one hour block at its beginning or end .",
    "seasonal visibility also leaves long gaps when no observations are possible @xcite .",
    "since the wts was primarily designed to find planets transiting m - dwarf stars , the observations are obtained in the j - band ( @xmath101.25@xmath19 m ) .",
    "this wavelength is near to the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a typical m - dwarf .",
    "hotter stars , with an emission peaking at shorter wavelength , are consequently fainter in this band .",
    "interestingly , photometric monitoring at nir wavelengths may have a further advantage as it is potentially less susceptible to the effect of star - spot induced variability @xcite .",
    "the discovery reported in this paper demonstrates that despite the survey optimisation for m - dwarfs , its uneven epoch distribution and the increased difficulty in obtaining high - precision light curves from ground - based infrared detectors , it is still able to detect hjs around fgk stars .",

    "the parameters of the planet are collected in  [ tab_wts1b ] .",

    "it is worth noting that only a cut - off of the transit depth , different for each survey , could act as a selection effect against the detection of planets in this upper portion of the diagram.larger planetary radii imply a deeper transit feature in the light curves and thus , within this mass range , larger object are more easily detectable . the properties of wts-1b , as well as those of the other two planets present in the upper part of the diagram , corot-2b @xcite and ogle2-tr - l9b @xcite , are not explained within standard formation and evolution models of isolated gas giant planets @xcite .",

    "wts-1b is shown in red.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the radius anomaly is at the @xmath23 level considering the stellar irradiation that retards the contraction of the planets , the distance of the planet from the host star and the age of the planet @xcite .",
    "the models of fortney and collaborators predict indeed a radius of 1.2 @xmath5  for a 600myr - old planet ( see their figure 5 , 3@xmath3  and 0.045au model ) .",
    "this radius estimate is an upper limit as 600myr is the lower limit on the age of the wts-1 system due to the li abundance ( see section  [ wts1 ] ) .",
    "the radius trend shown in the figure would suggest an age for wts-1b less than 10myr .",
    "the same significance on the radius anomaly is obtained considering empirical relationships coming from the fit of the observed radii as a function of the physical properties of the star - planet system , such as mass , equilibrium temperature and tidal heating ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) . in any case , a rapid migration of wts-1b inward to the highly - irradiated domain after its formation seems required .",
    "surface day / night temperature gradients due to the strong incident irradiation , are likely to generate strong wind activity through the planet atmosphere .",
    "recently , @xcite showed how the ohmic heating proposal @xcite can effectively bring energy in the interior of the planet and slow down the cooling contraction of a hj even on timescales of several gyr : a surface wind blowing across the planetary magnetic field acts as a battery that rises ohmic dissipation in the deeper layers . in @xcite , the ohmic dissipation in hjs",
    "is treated decoupling the interior of the planet and the wind zone . in this scenario",
    ", the radius evolution for an irradiated hj planet ( see their figure 9 , 3@xmath3 ) leads to a value consistent with our observation up to 3gyr .    accordingly to @xcite , the incident flux ( the amount of energy from the host star irradiation , per unit of time and surface , that heats the surface of the planet ) computed for wts-1b ( 1.12@xmath20.26 @xmath24 10@xmath25erg  s@xmath26  @xmath27 ) assigns it to the so called pm class of hjs .",
    "this classification considers the day - side atmospheres of the highly - irradiated hjs that are somewhat analogous to the m- and l - type dwarfs .",
    "in particular , the predictions of equilibrium chemistry for pm planet atmospheres are similar to m - dwarf stars , where absorption by tio , vo , @xmath28 , and co is prominent @xcite . planets in this class are warmer than required for condensation of titanium ( ti)- and vanadium ( v)-bearing compounds and will possess a temperature inversion ( which could lead to a smaller inflation due to ohmic heating accordingly to @xcite ) due to absorption of incident flux by tio and vo molecules .",
    "@xcite propose that these planets will have large day / night effective temperature contrasts and an anomalous brightness in secondary eclipse at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately , the snr in the @xmath20-band light curve , due to the faintness of the parent star wts-1 , is not high enough for such kind of detection ( see section  [ transit ] ) .    to conclude , the discovery of wts-1b demonstrates the capability of wts to find planets , even if it operates in a back - up mode during dead time on a queue - schedule telescope and despite of the somewhat randomised observing strategy .",
    "moreover , wts-1b is an inflated hj orbiting a late f - star even if the project is designed to search for extrasolar planets hosted by m - dwarfs .",
    "@xcite will present the second wts detection , wts-2b , a jupiter - like planet around a cool k - star .",
