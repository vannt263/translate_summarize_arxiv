    "this paper is concerned with the evolution of spatially homogeneous cosmological models with a cosmological constant .",
    "several authors have addressed this problem .",
    "stabell & refsdal @xcite investigated the friedmann - lematre dust models , and a generalization of their results to general equation of state appear in @xcite .",
    "the examination of bianchi models with two - component fluids by coley & wainwright @xcite contain the cosmological constant as a special case .",
    "the future evolution of bianchi models has been considered by wald @xcite , who showed that all non - type - ix bianchi models with a positive cosmological constant isotropize .",
    "the result applies to tilted models , but it should be pointed out that the isotropization is with respect to the congruence normal to the homogeneous symmetry surfaces  not the fluid congruence .",
    "the isotropization of inhomogeneous models has been studied in a newtonian context in @xcite , where some exact results were obtained .",
    "the key issue here is the degree to which such a constant ( or effective constant , due to a scalar field ) can lead to isotropization of the universe , and hence explain the presently observed near - isotropy .",
    "isotropization can happen to some degree in anisotropic models without a cosmological constant @xcite , but not sufficiently to convincingly explain the degree of isotropy observed .",
    "wald s theorem leads credence to the claim that inflationary models can isotropize the universe as desired , but there are limits to what inflation can achieve @xcite .",
    "hence even given all these important contributions , we think it is useful to examine the issue further , specifically by giving a treatment of these models in line with the dynamical systems methods presented in e.g. the book edited by wainwright & ellis @xcite .",
    "we will only examine the effect of a genuine cosmological constant here ; thus we do not consider proposals for a ` varying cosmological constant ' or scalar field ( or other essentially equivalent proposals ) .",
    "however , we believe that examination of those cases by the same dynamical systems methods , already initiated in the case of friedmann - lematre geometries @xcite and more general models @xcite , will be a worthwhile extension of what is presented here .    with the conventions we use ,",
    "the field equations take the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cosmological constant . in this paper , it is restricted to be non - negative , @xmath2 , with the focus on understanding the evolution when @xmath3 . interpreting @xmath1 as a vacuum energy",
    ", this implies that the vacuum energy is never negative .",
    "we will additionally assume a perfect - fluid matter source with @xmath4 as equation of state , where @xmath5 is the energy density , @xmath6 is the pressure , and @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "causality then requires @xmath7 to be in the interval @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath9 just corresponds to a second cosmological constant and will not be considered .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fl ] , the friedmann - lematre models are investigated .",
    "the detailed treatment of these well - known models is motivated by the fact that they contain many of the features exhibited by the more general models to be considered , and also illustrates the methods used in an example familiar to most readers",
    "[ sec : bia ] is concerned with the bianchi models .",
    "after some general statements about these models , we examine the simplest cases  orthogonal models of type i and ii  in more detail .",
    "the section is concluded with an investigation of tilted lrs type v models , which turns out to give us reason to be cautious about the implications of the important wald theorem @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ks ] we consider the kantowski - sachs models , which turn out to have a rather rich solution structure , with a particular interesting anisotropic boundary solution .",
    "we end with some conclusions in sec . [",
    "sec : conc ] .",
    "in order to introduce the notation used and compare with earlier results , we start by investigating the friedmann - lematre models . these models are homogeneous and isotropic about every point , corresponding to a six - dimensional isometry group @xmath10 . for a perfect fluid",
    ", the fluid motion then necessarily coincides with the congruence normal to the symmetry surfaces , and the models are fully specified by the length scale factor @xmath11 and a parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the line element can be written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant - curvature three - geometry . in",
    "what follows , a dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath15 . defining the hubble scalar by @xmath16 , the field equations and equations of motion become@xcite + _ the friedmann equation _ : @xmath17 _ the raychaudhuri equation _ : @xmath18 _ the energy conservation equation _ : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the three - curvature of the symmetry surfaces and @xmath21 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "assuming @xmath22 , we proceed by defining dimensionless variables according to was defined with opposite sign . ] @xmath23 the density parameter @xmath24 is related to @xmath25 and @xmath26 by + _ the friedmann equation _ : @xmath27 while the deceleration parameter is given by + _ the raychaudhuri equation _ :",
    "@xmath28 the weak energy condition together with @xmath2 immediately give @xmath29 in addition , for models with non - positive spatial curvature @xmath30 , these quantities are compact , i.e. the range is contained in a compact interval : @xmath31 upon introducing a new dimensionless time variable defined by @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 note that the @xmath34 equation is decoupled , so that we obtain a two - dimensional reduced dynamical system for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we obtain an auxiliary equation from + _ the energy conservation equation _ : @xmath35\\omega .\\ ] ] which then shows that the friedmann equation is an integral of the raychaudhuri equation ( explicitly , the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fried ] ) is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : omeqfl ] ) in virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flk ] ) ) .      the reduced dynamical system ( [ eq : flk][eq : floml ] ) has a number of invariant submanifolds :    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     all these are points on the vacuum boundary , except @xmath36 for which @xmath37 .",
    "it should be pointed out that although @xmath36 are saddles in the whole interval @xmath38 , the stability is changed at @xmath39 . we will only present state space diagrams for the case @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 point corresponds to an exact solution with @xmath42 , and line element @xmath43 this can be interpreted as a space - time where the shear exactly counter - balances the expansion in all but one spatial direction .",
    "this solution has a ` pancake ' singularity in the past .",
    "the contracting analogue of this solution is associated with @xmath44 .",
    "the solutions corresponding to these points have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus , the state space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ks - phsp ] ) exhibits many similarities with the @xmath45 friedmann - lematre models : the state space is divided into two halves , one of which corresponds to an expanding epoch ( @xmath46 ) and one where the models are contracting ( @xmath47 ) . in each half",
    ", there is a point corresponding to the de sitter solution .",
    "the points @xmath48 have a role similar to the einstein static point in the friedmann - lematre state space . indeed , just as in that case",
    ", the kantowski - sachs state space also contains models that contract and expand again without ever being singular . also , note the surfaces of separatrix orbits associated with the friedmann points @xmath36 .    to facilitate an easier understanding of the kantowski - sachs state space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ks - phsp ] ) , we present a picture of the @xmath49 submanifold ( fig . [",
    "fig : ks0-phsp ] ) .",
    "this state space was first given in @xcite .",
    "we have examined the evolution of various homogeneous cosmological models .",
    "the inclusion of a cosmological constant greatly affects the late - time behavior .",
    "for example , most bianchi models will evolve to a de sitter universe and isotropize , as pointed out by wald @xcite .",
    "the models presented here confirm the broad picture presented by wald of a positive cosmological constant leading to isotropization in the orthogonal case , but leave it open in the more general tilted case .",
    "more precisely , there are models for which the tilt does not vanish at late times . to an observer moving with the fluid , this model will not seem to isotropize .",
    "these models may appear isotropic in another frame at late times , but whether that is in fact true or not is an open question .",
    "tilted models deserve more investigation , as does the case of a realistic scalar field representation ( the investigation here can represent a model including a slow - rolling scalar field , but not one where the dynamics of the scalar field is more interesting ) ."
