    "tourism and hospitality sectors have witnessed enormous growth in the past century . originating as a pastime of the wealthy , only very recently",
    "technological advances and global economic progress have brought traveling for leisure closer to nearly all layers of the society @xcite .",
    "the rise from modest beginnings has been astounding , and today tourism accounts for nearly @xmath0 of the world s gross domestic product , employing more than @xmath1 million people worldwide @xcite .",
    "the upward trend is projected to continue in the future at unabated rates , further highlighting the impact and the importance of the thriving industry .",
    "given such deep economic footprint , it is highly beneficial to understand customers behavior in order to satisfy the growing demand .",
    "a number of challenging problems has brought attention of researchers , who proposed diverse approaches towards painting a clearer picture of a modern tourist .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite authors focus on understanding how tourists make their travel plans , while authors of @xcite tackle the task of profiling of hotel patrons and learning actionable behavioral patterns using rule mining . in the absence of travel data , some studies attempt to recreate travel information using online photos and other resources",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to modeling tourist behavior when they are already on the road , understanding decision process that led to booking of the trip is equally important , as it allows tourist companies to actively influence decisions of a potential customer at its source through better ad targeting @xcite . for example , effect of online reviews on booking decisions is explored in @xcite , while @xcite analyzes impact of information overload . however",
    ", such studies mostly rely on surveys comprising few hundred examples , limiting their generality .",
    "we address this issue , and explore booking behavior of millions of online customers by mining their travel receipts .",
    "we collected more than 25 million travel receipts , received by a subset of yahoo mail users from january through april , 2015 .",
    "we considered flight , hotel , and car rental receipts , for which we extracted booking timestamp , travel ( for flights ) and check - in and check - out dates ( for hotels and rentals ) .",
    "the data was anonymized ( users were assigned random ids ) .",
    "first , let us consider weekly distribution of check - in and booking days . in figure",
    "[ fig : weekly_travel ] we can see that the largest number of hotel check - ins and rental pick - ups happens on fridays and saturdays , while flights had largely uniform distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : weekly_booking ] , the largest number of bookings for hotels and rentals is made on mondays , and on tuesdays for flights .",
    "the least number of bookings in all cases is made on fridays .",
    "another interesting finding was a huge increase in hotel check - ins on valentine s day ( not shown ) , more than 2 times higher number than rates one week before or after .",
    "curiously , we did not see the corresponding increase in flights and rentals , implying that most of these hotel stays were local .",
    "we take a closer look at the booking channels independently . in figure",
    "[ fig : cumul_flight ] we analyze airline booking times segregated by companies . around 22% of flights are booked within one week ahead of the trip . however , when we take a look at each company individually , this fluctuates from 10% for ryanair to 35% for us airways .",
    "the results suggests that customers plan further ahead for lower - cost companies which often have special deals and promotions in such cases .    for hotels",
    ", we can see that there is a significant difference between short - term ( less than 7 days ) and long - term stay ( 7 days and more ) in terms of number of days the rooms are booked in advance . for short - term stay nearly 40% of all bookings",
    "are made within one week in advance , while for long - term stay the percentage drops to 15% .",
    "in other words , customers are planning more in advance for longer , more expensive stays .",
    "we also observe jumps in the number of bookings 60 days in advance , which could be explained by black - out windows imposed by some loyalty programs .",
    "lastly , we see that more than 45% of rentals are booked within 7 days from car pick - up date .",
    "this grows to 70% one month prior to pick - up , indicating that rentals are planned much less ahead than either flights or hotels .",
    "next we analyzed time difference between bookings from different channels made for the same trip , where the bookings were deemed part of the same trip if the check - in times are within 24 hours .",
    "we only considered trips where the difference between booking dates and check - in date is longer than 30 days , in order to avoid the effect of late purchases which would bias the bookings to be temporally close .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig : diffs ] , where @xmath2-axis shows number of days between bookings from two different channels .    by considering the three subfigures",
    ", we can see that the majority of two - channel bookings are made within 10 days from each other .",
    "moreover , we can conclude that when users are booking more than one channel for a single trip ( e.g. , booking a flight in addition to hotel , or rental in addition to flight ) , they are mostly purchasing them in the order  flight @xmath3 hotel @xmath3 rental \" , going from higher demand toward smaller demand channels .",
    "interestingly , this conclusion is also confirmed by figure [ fig : cumul_receipt ] , where 50% of flights are booked around 30 days in advance , 50% of short - term hotel stays around 20 days in advance , while half of car rentals are booked 10 days in advance .",
    "these insights are of great importance to booking agencies ( e.g. , they provide guidance on how and when to target users that already booked a flight ) .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to behavior prediction task . in particular , we predict when a user will book a rental given they already booked a flight .",
    "we cast the problem as a classification task and predict labels ",
    "< 5 days \" ,  6 - 10 \" ,  11 - 20 \" ,  21 - 40 \" , and  > 41 or never \" , while we used age , gender , and past bookings in each channel as features .",
    "we trained logistic regression ( we split the data into equally - sized training and test sets ) , and compared to baselines that predict most frequent label and most frequent label in age - gender groups ( age buckets were set to",
    " < 26 \" ,  26 - 40 \" ,  > 40 \" ) .",
    "the results are given in table [ tbl : classification ] , where we see that the proposed approach outperformed the baselines ."
