    "the phase displacement also is presented at the cores of si  ii resonance lines at @xmath1  130409 and 1485   .",
    "the same phase displacement is at the cores of the fe  ii depressions in the spectral region with @xmath2  @xmath18  2505   .",
    "but , the variability of the flux at the cores of the fe  ii depressions in this spectral region is the same as in the pseudo - continuum.    the minimal values of the amplitude of the flux variations are reached at the cores of the large features at @xmath1  1560 and 1770   and at the cores of the strong si  ii resonance lines at @xmath1  126064 , 130409 and 1485   . the flux at the cores of large feature at @xmath2  1770  and fe  ii resonance line at @xmath2  172531   , within errors measurements , does not vary .",
    "the investigation of variability of the flux in the wings of @xmath3 line indicate that the fluxes , which formed in inner layers of atmosphere , are redistributed into outer layers of atmosphere of @xmath0  cvn .",
    "although , the independent investigation of @xmath3 line variations in the high - resolution mode is needed in order to confirm our result .",
