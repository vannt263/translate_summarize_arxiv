    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most fascinating models beyond the standard model ( sm ) , which can simultaneously solve the naturalness problem , explain the cosmic dark matter and achieve the gauge coupling unification .",
    "searching for the susy particles is an important task for lhc especially after the discovery of higgs . with the recent 13  fb@xmath3 dataset of lhc ,",
    "a gluino and a stop lighter than 1.8 tev and 900 gev have been excluded out respectively if the mass splitting between the stop and the lsp is large enough , and the mass of an electroweakino has been excluded to 0.4 - 1 tev depending on the decay mode .",
    "all the results push susy scale much higher than before , which further challenges our understanding on the naturalness problem",
    ".    among those tens of super - particles , the top partner - stop , plays the most important role to understand the naturalness in susy models . in the framework of natural supersymmetry ,",
    "a light stop and higgsino are usually predicted  @xcite .",
    "lots of works have been done on searching for such light stops and higgsinos  @xcite .",
    "recently atlas reported some excesses in the stop search with @xmath4 channel  @xcite .",
    "seven signal regions are defined and three of them observed more than @xmath2 excesses , among which the most significant one could reach @xmath0 .",
    "although no significant excess is reported by cms in the same channel  @xcite , they observe mild excesses in several signal regions . even in the @xmath5 lepton channel searches",
    "@xcite , atlas and cms both show small excesses with a lower significance . if they are true signals it is likely due to new particles .    in this paper",
    ", we study the interpretation of the excesses as light stop pair production in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) .",
    "although atlas and cms have done the similar analyses based on the simplified models , the results might be changed in a concrete model of mssm .",
    "we show that the simplified models where stop decays into a higgsino or a bino are not favored by other stop searches while extended models could provide a better fit to the excess .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly overview the atlas @xmath4 search and the other constraints at the lhc in section  [ sec : stop ] . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we interpret the excess by a light stop pair production in the mssm . in section  [ sec : darkmatter ] , we discuss the dark matter constraints , such as the relic abundance and the direct detection constraints .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the atlas @xmath4 search mainly aims at stop pair production followed by stop decay into top and neutralino , where one of the resulting top decay leptonically .",
    "although more details are found in  @xcite we summarize some of the selection cuts and the results in table  [ tab : atlas ] .",
    "seven signal regions are defined for the searches . among them , the signal regions of dm_low , bc2x_diag and sr1 observe @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 excesses , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the sr1 signal region was already defined before and an excess around @xmath9 had been reported even with the 3.2  fb@xmath3 data  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      there are other stop searches based on 0 lepton , 1 lepton , and 2 leptons both from atlas and cms , which constrain the stop parameter space . we have found the 1 lepton search constraints from cms  @xcite gives more or less similar to that of the atlas , therefore , considering the signal regions with no excess in atlas 1 lepton search is enough .",
    "the two lepton search channels do not set strong constraints  @xcite , and we did not consider them in this paper .",
    "the cms 0 lepton search channels set slightly stronger bound than those of atlas , therefore , we consider the following two hadronic stop search channels at cms to set the 95% cl exclusion .",
    "the cms boosted top search requires top tagging and is especially sensitive to the stop with a large mass splitting with lsp , where boosted tops are expected in the final state .",
    "the cms hadronic stop search aims at more conventional topologies from stop decay . in the following , the atlas 1 lepton search is denoted as atlas_1l , the cms hadronic stop search  @xcite is denoted as cms_hadronic and cms boosted top search  @xcite is denoted as cms_boosted .",
    "in this paper we interpret the excess from a light stop pair production and their decays .",
    "we assume the lightest stop dominantly consists of the right handed stop  ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 usually is accompanied by @xmath12 which is close in mass , and it is constrained strongly with a bound up to about 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "we first consider a simple 1-step decay from the right - handed stops .",
    "depending on the dominant component of the lsp , the constraints are modified as the decay modes change .",
    "we scan the parameter space to figure out the corresponding @xmath2 favored region in dm_low .",
    "our simulation for atlas_1l and cms_hadronic searches are based on madgraph + pythia  @xcite , and the generated signal events are passed to delphes3  @xcite for a detector simulation . for recasting cms_boosted search",
    "we simply compare the cross sections rescaled with @xmath13 with the upper bound of the cross section given in the cms paper assuming the best sensitivity is from two boosted top tagged events .",
    "we first consider the simplest model : the lightest supersymmetric particle  ( lsp ) is bino and the next - lightest supersymmetric particle  ( nlsp ) is @xmath10 . as shown in fig  [ decay_bino ] , the only decay channel is @xmath14 in this model , which is frequently assumed for many analyses in atlas and cms . in fig  [ bino ]",
    "we show the @xmath2 favored region by the excess in dm_low and the 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion contours on the @xmath15 plane from atlas_1l , cms_hadronic , and cms_boosted searches .",
    "the strongest limit is from cms_boosted search because the tops in the final state tend to be boosted .",
    "we find all the @xmath16 favored region are excluded out by cms_boosted and almost all the @xmath2-region is excluded .      to ease the tension from cms_boosted stop search , we may consider a model where the stop has other decay channels than the direct decay into top and lsp .",
    "as an example , we consider another simplified model where lsp is higgsino .",
    "for the higgsino lsp case , the higgsinos ( @xmath17 ) and charged higgsino ( @xmath18 ) is naturally degenerate . as the typical mass difference is @xmath19 gev",
    ", we can not observe the decay products from those particles essentially and all particles behaves like lsp in terms of the collider signature at the lhc .",
    "the branching ratios are @xmath20 when the phase space suppression due to the top mass is negligible . thus , the contribution of the two boosted tops is reduced by a factor @xmath21 . since cms_boosted stop search relays on two boosted tops in the final states , the constraint becomes much weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath22 signal can originate from events with one stop decay into a top and the other into a bottom , thus , there are no strong reduction factor . in fig  [ higgsino ]",
    "we show the signal preferred region and several exclusion contours . in the plot we fixed @xmath23 .",
    "note the branching ratios of stop decay do not change a lot when we vary the @xmath24 because higgsino - stop coupling only comes from the yukawa .",
    "the gray region is limited by direct chargino search from lep@xcite .",
    "the cms_boosted stop search becomes significantly weaker , and there appears a large region not excluded by either atlas_1l and cms_boosted but in the @xmath2 favored region .",
    "however , the cms_hadronic constraints are still strong enough to exclude the whole @xmath2 signal favored region . it is because reducing @xmath25 also reduce the number of 1 lepton signals , while the conventional 0 lepton signals are not reduced and it results in a similar sensitivity to the bino lsp case .     favored region and the excluded region from the bino lsp model . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]     favored region and the excluded region from the higgsino lsp model . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "although by reducing @xmath26 the tension between cms_boosted and atlas_1l searches could be eased , it also reduces the signal events and makes the conventional hadronic stop search relatively more effective .",
    "to avoid this situation , keeping more signal events while reducing top branching ratio is necessary , therefore , it is preferable to find a way to make the @xmath27 also contribute to enhance the lepton signals .",
    "we consider here a model where nlsp is higgsino and lsp is bino . since the chargino will decay into @xmath28 plus neutralino , one lepton could come from the @xmath28 decay through a two step decay .",
    "we set the mass difference between stop and higgsino 150  gev to forbid @xmath29 decay to make the discussion simpler .",
    "we have checked that opening @xmath30 mode also gives similar final results .        in fig",
    "[ fig : higgsinobino ] , we show our simulation results recasting the atlas_1l , cms_hadronic , and cms_boosted searches on the @xmath15 plane assuming @xmath31  gev .",
    "large parameter region in the higgsino + bino lsp model satisfying @xmath32  gev with @xmath33  gev or @xmath34  gev@xmath35  gev with @xmath36  gev is found consistent within @xmath2 to all constraints although @xmath16 favored region is still excluded by both atlas_1l and cms_hadronic .",

    "we fix @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 . left side of the lux line has been excluded by the dark matter direct detection experiments.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "atlas_1l also provides the @xmath39 and @xmath40 distributions in dm_low .",
    "we have selected three benchmark points , which are indicated with crosses in fig  [ fig : higgsinobino ] , and show the expected distributions .",
    "the background distributions we just take from the atlas plots .",
    "the benchmark points with stop - bino mass 650 - 350 gev , 750 - 300 gev , 800 - 200 gev predict the signal events in dm_low to be 9.4 ( @xmath41 ) , 9.8 ( @xmath42 ) and 8.3 ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .",
    "the numbers in the parentheses indicate the statistical deviations assuming the corresponding signal injection , to be compared with @xmath44 of no signal assumption .",
    "although all the benchmark points are consistent within @xmath45 based on the total number of events in dm_low the predicted distributions are different .",
    "we find compressed spectrum is slightly preferred as the overflow bin does nt contain much events .",
    "in the future these distributions would be important to distinguish between models .     and @xmath40 distribution for the three benchmark points in the consistent region of the higgsino + bino lsp model .",

    "the right most bin contains overflow events.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    although we only consider the higgsino - bino case ( we denote the case with higgsino nlsp and bino lsp as higgsino - bino , etc . in the following )",
    ", we would like give some comments on other possibilities .",
    "since the coupling between stop  ( @xmath10 ) and wino is suppressed by the neutralino mixing , the wino - bino ( wino - higgsino ) cases are essentially reduced to the bino ( higgsino ) lsp case . with the large l - r mixing in stop sector we can tune the relative branching ratios by the stop mixing angle and",
    "the collider signature of the wino - bino case could be similar to the higgsino - bino model .",
    "three remaining possibilities are bino - higgsino , bino - wino , and higgsino - wino cases . for the bino - higgsino case ,",
    "the stop dominantly decays into a higgsino , as stop couples higgsinos thorough the top yukawa coupling , which is much stronger than bino through the gauge coupling , and due to the phase space suppression , therefore , it is again reduced to the higgsino lsp case .",
    "the higgsino - wino case is similar to the higgsino - bino case but the higgsino decay pattern is more complex , and branching ratio into @xmath28 would be suppressed .",
    "the bino - wino case might be an interesting possibility but constrained by the multi - lepton searches .",
    "on the other hand , direct detection constraint must be significantly weak for this case whereas indirect searches might be dangerous .",
    "also notice that the long lived charged particle searches at 8 tev  lhc already set the lower bound of the wino mass around 270 gev  @xcite , and the allowed parameter space would be highly constrained .",
    "in the previous section , we study the case where bino is the lsp .",
    "it might overclose the universe because the pair annihilation cross section of bino like dark matter is rather small .",
    "an interesting possibility is to resort to the slepton co - annihilation .",
    "if a slepton is nearly degenerate with the bino lsp @xmath46  gev  @xcite it would help to reduce the relic abundance to the observed one .",
    "one may wonder inserting slepton in the spectrum will affect the decay mode of the chargino .",
    "as the coupling between slepton and higgsino is proportional to the corresponding lepton yukawa coupling only a light stau with a large @xmath24 could affect the branching ratios .",
    "note that the chargino decaying into neutralino plus @xmath28 is dominated by the longitudinal mode of @xmath28 ( from @xmath47-@xmath48-@xmath49 interaction ) , and not suppressed by the higgsino - bino mixing .",
    "the stau decaying channel only becomes sizable when the @xmath50 is enhanced by very large @xmath24 .",
    "taking @xmath38 as an example , we find in our @xmath2 favored region , the stau decay mode at most has a branching ratio of @xmath51 . if we reduce the @xmath52 , this decay branching ratio only takes 3% , so our fig  [ fig : higgsinobino ] is essentially unchanged .",
    "moreover , the @xmath53 emitted from the @xmath54 decay is not detectable at the collider due to the small mass difference .    the dark matter",
    "direct search also constrains the higgsino - bino model due to the mixing between higgsino and bino . in fig",
    "[ fig : higgsinobino ] we draw the sensitivity of the latest lux results  @xcite the parameter space on the left side of the line has been excluded . in the plot we fix @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 , sign@xmath55 , and the higgs mass",
    "is also tuned to be 125 gev .",
    "we find one of our benchmark points has been excluded out and one just lives the boundary of exclusion line .",
    "therefore the future dark matter direct search will be important to test this scenario if the signal is confirmed at the lhc .",
    "note that in the case of sign@xmath56 , there exists a blind spot region for dark matter direct search when @xmath57 is satisfied@xcite .",
    "we may also assume r - parity is violated and bino could decay into sm particles with the life time long enough in a collider time scale .",
    "in such a case , the constraints discussed in this section are not applicable .",
    "in this paper , we try to interpret the @xmath0 excess reported in atlas @xmath1 channel by a light stop pair production in the mssm . after considering the consistency with other stop searches ,",
    "we find : ( 1 ) simple models where stop decays into a higgsino or a bino are not favored by the other search channels ( 2 ) an extension of them , higgsino - bino lsp , can explain the data at @xmath2 level without conflicting with the other search channels .",
    "it is remarkable that the susy spectrum in the surviving stop decay scenario for the possible excess , that is a light stop and a light higgsino , is nothing but what we expect in a natural susy .",
