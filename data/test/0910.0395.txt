    "quantum field theory ( qft ) has been very successful in the description of a large number of phenomena , in particular in high energy physics .",
    "however there is a widespread belief that qft in many cases only accounts for effective theories and that it is not suited to constitute a fundamental theory but should be replaced by another concept at a microscopic scale .",
    "this is due to the apparent non - renormalisability of important action functionals , e.g. the einstein - hilbert action , describing gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore the standard model of particle physics is plagued by the problem of triviality in the sector describing quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite and in the higgs sector @xcite , which forbids to extend the standard model beyond a certain ultraviolet scale .",
    "however the issue of non - renormalisability is often adressed within _ perturbative _ qft , which is not an essential concept of qft itself . for perturbative qft to apply it has to be possible to expand about vanishing interactions , i.e. , about the gauian fixed - point ( gfp ) , which is a severe limitation . a more general conceptual understanding of qft , not sticking to the constraint of perturbativity , was elucidated by steven weinberg when he introduced the idea of asymptotic safety @xcite . in an asymptotically safe qft the microscopic action entering the functional integral approaches an interacting fixed point in the space of action functionals in the infinite uv cutoff limit .",
    "thus no unwanted divergencies can occur .",
    "this renders the theory well - defined on all scales .",
    "the scenario has already been applied to a number of models ranging from four - fermion models @xcite , simple yukawa systems @xcite , nonlinear sigma models in @xmath2 @xcite , extra - dimensional gauge theories @xcite , and gravity @xcite .    the idea of asymtpotic safety has gained considerable attention in the context of gravity , especially in the last 10 years .",
    "in fact , there is a lot of evidence that such an interacting fixed point exists for diffeomorphism invariant actions , allowing for a formulation of a non - perturbative renormalisable quantum field theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the calculations necessary to compute the rg flow in theory space , however , are tedious and involve a number of techniques , such as e.g. the background field method , that complicate the discussion of the bare concept of asymptotic safety considerably",
    ". it would therefore be convenient to have a simpler setting , where the idea and the basic concepts of asymptotic safety could be tested and understood in a transparent manner .    on the quest for such a simpler setting the standard model with its problem of triviality",
    "might be a beacon . here",
    ", the landau poles of perturbation theory in the qed and the higgs sector suggest that one should introduce new degrees of freedom for a fundamental description of particle physics .",
    "however , before doing so a non - perturbative computation of the higgs sector including fermions and also gauge fields would have to show whether the problem of triviality still persists or whether the theory might be asymptotically safe in weinberg s sence , by acquiring a fixed point in the ultraviolet . as a step towards this scenario , we investigate a toy model for the standard model without gauge fields and with a particular chiral left / right asymmetry @xcite . to leading order in the derivative expansion , we find an asymptotically safe theory which is well - defined on all scales ( renormalisable ) with a highly predictive power and comparatively simple from a computational point of view . apart from a possible application to the complete standard model of particle physics including a prediction of the higgs and the top mass",
    ", it also allows for a better understanding of how asymptotic safety works .",
    "this contribution is organised as follows : in section [ sec : problems ] we briefly recall triviality and the hierarchy problem as they occur in the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "section [ sec : as ] introduces the idea of asymptotic safety and the wetterich equation , which is our tool to investigate qft non - perturbatively . in section [ sec : yukawa ] we discuss our toy model , a particular chiral yukawa system , whose fixed - point structure is analysed in section [ sec : fixedpoints ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "in the higgs sector of the standard model we find the problem of triviality and the hierarchy problem . to understand the nature of the triviality problem , it suffices to consider a purely bosonic theory , where we mimic the higgs field in terms of a single component real scalar field @xmath3 , with a lagrangian @xmath4 using one - loop rg - improved perturbation theory we can establish a relation between the bare and the renormalized four - higgs - boson coupling @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the bare and the renormalised couplings , respectively , @xmath9 is the ultraviolet cutoff scale and @xmath10 the renormalised mass . for fixed non - zero ( non - trivial ) @xmath8 and @xmath10 the bare coupling @xmath7 runs into a pole at a finite uv scale , the landau pole @xmath11 .",
    "this indicates the breakdown of the perturbative qft at this scale .    for a purely bosonic theory also",
    "a nonperturbative treatment of qft ( e.g. , on the lattice ) confirms triviality , inhibiting the theory to be fundamental .",
    "however the standard model higgs sector of course contains bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom ; as we show in sect .",
    "[ sec : fixedpoints ] , a balancing of the fermionic and bosonic quantum fluctuations can make the pole disappear and render the system well - defined on all scales .    whereas the triviality problem is a conceptual problem , the hierarchy problem is only a problem of the unnaturalness of",
    "strongly fine - tuned initial conditions .",
    "we observe a huge hierarchy in the standard model between the electroweak scale @xmath12 and e.g. the scale of a grand unified theory @xmath13 .",
    "the higgs mass renormalises quadratically with the uv cutoff @xmath9 and in perturbation theory the relation between bare and renormalised mass is given by @xmath14 here , the renormalised mass is of order @xmath15 , and the fluctuation contribution is of the order of the cutoff @xmath16 ( here , @xmath17 is a pure number depending on the coupling values ) . as a consequence",

    "it is this second term in parentheses which has to be fine - tuned to a relative precision of @xmath19 . in an rg language",

    ". a nonperturbative analysis with an interacting fixed point might have small critical exponents , e.g. close to zero , which could lead to a weaker cutoff dependence and the chance to make the hierarchy problem disappear .",

    "<S> we introduce weinberg s idea of asymptotic safety and pave the way towards an asymptotically safe chiral yukawa system with a @xmath0 symmetry in a leading - order derivative expansion using nonperturbative functional rg equations . as a toy model sharing important features with the standard model we explicitely discuss @xmath1 for which we find a non - gauian fixed point and compute its critical exponents . </S>",
