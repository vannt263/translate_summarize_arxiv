    "the intuitive feeling that hadron matter should be maximally perturbed in the high energy extremely inelastic collisions was a main reason of our effort to consider such processes .",
    "it was a hope to observe new dynamical phenomena , or new degrees of freedom , unattainable in other ordinary hadron reactions .",
    "this paper presents a first attempt to describe the particularity of considered processes , to give a review of existing models prediction and , at the end , we will offer the field - theoretical formalism for hadron inelastic processes .",
    "thus , considering hadrons mean multiplicity @xmath3 as a natural scale of the produced hadrons multiplicity @xmath4 at given cm energy @xmath5 , we would assume that n>>. 0.1at the same time we wish to have n<<n_max=/m , 0.2where @xmath6 gev is the characteristic hadron mass .",
    "the last restriction is introduced to weaken the unphysical constraints from the finite , for given @xmath7 , phase space volume .",
    "we should assume therefore that @xmath7 is high enough .",
    "the multiple production is the process of colliding particles where kinetic energy is dissipated into the mass of produced particles .",
    "then one may validate that the entropy @xmath8 accedes its maximum in the domain ( ) since the multiplicity @xmath4 characterizes the rate of stochastization , i.e. the level of incident energy dissipation over existing ( free ) degrees of freedom .",
    "there is also another quantitative definition of our reactions .",
    "let @xmath9 be the energy of the fastest particle in the given frame and let @xmath10 be the total incident energy in the same frame .",
    "then the difference ( @xmath11 ) is the energy spent on production of the less energetic particles .",
    "it is useful to consider the inelasticity coefficient = = 1 - 1 .",
    "0.2ait defines the portion of spent energy .",
    "therefore , we wish to consider processes with 1 - 1 . 0.2cfollowing ( ) we will assume that 1->>. 0.2dtherefore , the kinetic energy of produced particles in our processes can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "using thermodynamical terminology , we wish investigate the production and properties of comparatively ` cold ' multi - hadron ( mostly of @xmath12-mesons ) state .",
    "we would like to note from the very beginning that we have only a qualitative scenario of such states which may be produced and the review of the corresponding why s may be considered as the main purpose of this paper .",
    "although at the end of this paper ( appendix k ) we will describe principal features of possible field - theoretical solution of our problem .",
    "it should be noted the absence of any authentic experimental information concerning discussed processes .",
    "moreover , actually the hadron inelastic interactions with a set peculiar to them of unsolved theoretical problems will be considered .",
    "nevertheless we suggest to work in this field in spite of these difficulties because the system with extremal properties may be more transparent since the asymptotics always simplify a picture .",
    "we would demonstrate this idea and will try to put it in the basis of developed theoretical methods .",
    "absence of experimental information about so high inelastic hadron processes is the consequence of the smallness of corresponding cross sections . besides this it was unclear for what purpose the experimental efforts should be done .",
    "we would like to convince the reader that the discussed problem is interesting and important .",
    "for instance , we will discuss a possibility that asymptotics over @xmath4 may replace in definite sense the asymptotics over @xmath5 .",
    "a short address to experimentalists will be given in concluding sec.4.1.2 .",
    "we hope that the paper would be useful both for theorists and experimentalists . by this reason",
    "the main text of this paper will contain only the qualitative discussion of the problems and results . the quantitative proof , formulation of pure theoretical methods etc .",
    "are added in the appendices",
    ". considered extremal problem is a good theoretical laboratory and is described in the appendices and theoretical methods may be applied for other physical problems .",
    "we would like to point out that the special technique was built for the problem discussed , see sec.2 .    ",
    "_ having the very high multiplicity ( vhm ) state it is natural to use the thermodynamical methods .",
    "_ we will offer for this purpose the real - time @xmath0-matrix interpretation of thermodynamics .",
    "it can be shown in what quantitative conditions it will coincide with simpler canonical imaginary - time matsubara formalism",
    ". we will give also the generalization of the real - time finite - temperature perturbation theory in the case of local temperature @xmath13 distribution , when @xmath14 .",
    "this will allow to use the thermodynamical description if the system is far from equilibrium .",
    " _ the particle spectrum in the vhm region is soft .",
    "it is just a situation when the collective phenomena should be important . _ to describe this phenomena , the decomposition on correlators will be adopted .",
    "the origin of this decomposition lie in the mayer s ` group decomposition ' . in multiple production physics",
    "this decomposition is known also as the ` multi - component description ' .",
    "it based on the idea that the multiple production process may include various mechanisms .",
    "in sec.3 we will investigate model predictions for vhm region .",
    "we would like to note two main conclusions :     existing multiperipheral - type models are unable to describe the vhm region .    ",
    "the infrared region of the pqcd becomes important even if the constraint ( ) is taken into account .",
    "in sec.2.1 we will try to formulate the phenomenology of our problem , i.e. the way the vhm processes may be described and what type of phenomena one may expect .",
    "the importance of thermodynamical methods will became evident and we will offer in sec.2.2 a general description of the corresponding formalism .    it is important to note that we may classify the possible asymptotics over @xmath4 .",
    "we will find that there exist only three classes of asymptotics .",
    "this will simplify consideration definitely restricting the possibilities .",
    "in sec.2.3 we will use the thermodynamical language to give a physical interpretation of these classes of asymptotics .",
    "we will see in result that in our choice of the vhm final state this should lead to reorganization of multiple production dynamics : we will get out of the habitual multiperipheral picture in the vhm domain .",
    "moreover , one may assume that the semiclassical approximation becomes exact in the vhm domain .",
    "this naturally leads to the idea to search such a scheme of calculation which depends on the choice of final state",
    ". quantitative description of this idea may be realized as is described in appendix k.      the vhm production phenomena includes two sub - problems .",
    "first of all it is the dynamical problem of incident energy degradation into the secondary particle energies and the second one is the description of the final state",
    ".    we will start discussion in sec.2.1.1 from the second part of the problem to explain that the statistical methods are essential for us .    in sec.2.1.2",
    "we will try to outline at least qualitatively the main mechanisms of hadron production .",
    "the peculiarity of hadron production phenomena consists in the presence of hidden constraints , the consequence of local non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "the constraints may prevent thermalization and the incident energy dissipation is confused in this case .",
    "just the ` confusing ' effect is dominant in the hadron multiple production processes if @xmath15 .",
    "the expected change of dominant mechanism of hadron production is discussed sec.2.1.3 .",
    "it is important that , in spite of hidden constraints , the system may freely evolve to define the vhm state .",
    "such a vhm state should be in equilibrium .",
    "formal definition of the ` equilibrium ' notion will be given in sec.2.2.2 .",
    "the problem described contains small parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 . to have the possibility of estimation of contributions in accordance with these parameters",
    "one should include them into the formalism .",
    "this becomes possible if and only if the integral quantities are calculated .",
    "so , the multiplicity @xmath4 is an index only if the multiple production amplitudes @xmath18 are considered .",
    "but the cross section @xmath19 is a nontrivial @xmath20 of @xmath4 .",
    "we will calculated by this logic mostly integrals of @xmath21 , living out the consideration the amplitudes , see also sec.2.2 , where the first realization of this idea is offered ( the @xmath22 attempt to realize this idea one may find in ) .",
    "this is a general methodological feature of our consideration .",
    "the multiple production cross section @xmath19 falls down rapidly in the discussed very high multiplicity ( vhm ) domain ( ) and for this reason the multiplicities @xmath23 are not accessible experimentally . at",
    "the lhc energy @xmath24 is valid and we will assume that @xmath25 is just the discussed vhm region ( @xmath26 at the lhc energy ) .",
    "we will explain later why n~^2 0.1is chosen for the definition of vhm region .    generally speaking , having the state of a large number of particles , it is reasonable to depart from an exact definition of the number @xmath4 of created particles , their individual energies @xmath27 , momenta @xmath28 , etc . since they can not be defined exactly by experiment .",
    "indeed , for instance , full reconstruction of kinematics is a practically impossible task because of neutral particles , neutrinos , the more so as @xmath29 is considered .",
    "we suppose that nothing will happen if @xmath4 is measured with @xmath30 accuracy since @xmath31 is easily attainable in the vhm region . besides it is practically impossible to deal with theory which operates by the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ! ) variables .",
    "artificial reduction of the set of the necessary variables may lead to a temporary success only .",
    "indeed , the last thirty years of multiple production physics development was based on the inclusive approach , when the measured quantities ( cross sections ) depend on a few dynamical parameters only .",
    "but later on the experiment and its fractal analyses shows that the situation is not so simple , also as , for instance , for the classical turbulence .",
    "so , the event - by - event experimental data shows that the particle density fluctuation is unexpectedly large and the fractal dimension @xmath34 is not equal to zero .",
    "we know that if the fractal dimension is non - trivial , then the system is extremely ` non - regular ' .",
    "so , @xmath350.3 for the perimeter of great britain and @xmath350.5 for norway .",
    "the discrepancy marks the fact that the shore of norway is much more broken then of great britain .",
    "it is noticeable that the fractal dimension @xmath34 crucially depends on the type of reaction , incident energy and so on .",
    "it is evident that one may choose from @xmath32 an arbitrary finite set of variables to characterize the multiple production process .",
    "but the fractal analyses shows that such approach would lead to the same effect as if one may hear , for example , only the first violin of mahler s music .",
    "so , it is important to understand when the restricted set of dynamical variables will admit to describe the process ( state ) @xmath36 .",
    "the same problem was solved in statistical physics , where the ` rough ' description by a restricted number of ( thermodynamical ) parameters is a basis of its success , see the discussion of rough variables description e.g. in the review of uhlenbeck .",
    "we will search the same solution desiring to build a complete theory of the vhm hadron reactions .",
    "we want to note that just vhm process may be in this sense ` simple ' : at all evidence , the system becomes ` quiet ' in the vhm region and by this reason its ` rough ' thermodynamical description is available .",
    "it seems natural , therefore , to start investigation of multiple production phenomena from the ( extremely rare ) vhm processes .",
    "the dominant inelastic hadron processes at @xmath15 are saturated by production of low transverse momentum hadrons .",
    "one of the approaches explains this phenomena by the nonperturbative effect of quarks created from vacuum .",
    "corresponding dynamics looks as follows . at the expanse of transverse kinetic motion color charges may separated at large distances . nevertheless the transverse motion is suppressed since separation leads to increasing polarization of vacuum , because of confinement phenomenon .",
    "then , as in qed , the vacuum becomes unstable in regard to the tunneling creation of real fermions .",
    "just on their creation , the transverse kinetic energy is spent and , as a result , particles can not have , with exponential accuracy , high transverse energies .",
    "this picture is attractive being simple and transparent , but despite numerous efforts , there is no quantitative description of this phenomenon till now .",
    "briefly , the problem is connected with the unknown mechanism of strong coloured electric fields formation among distant colored charges , see also .",
    "one may use other terms .",
    "the soft channel of multiple production means the long - range correlation among hadron coloured constituents . under this special correlation",
    "the non - abelian gauge field theory conservation laws constraint were implied .",
    "they are important in dynamics since each conservation law decreases the number of independent degrees of freedom at least on one unity ( this may explain why hadrons @xmath37 ) , i.e. it has the nonperturbative effect .",
    "moreover , in so - called integrable systems each independent integral of motion ( in involution ) reduces the number of degrees of freedom on two units . as a result",
    "there is no thermalization in such systems and the corresponding mean multiplicity @xmath38 should be equal to zero , see appendix k.    existence of multiple production , @xmath39 , testifies the statement that the thermalization phenomena exist in hadron processes , i.e. the system of yang - mills fields is not completely integrable .",
    "but the most probable process with @xmath15 did not lead to the final state with maximal entropy since @xmath40 , i.e. the definite restrictions on the dissipation dynamics should be taken into account .",
    "such problems , being intermediate , are mostly complicated ones",
    ".    the quantitative theory of this phenomena may lead to deep revision of the main notions of existing quantum field theory , see appendix k.",
    "so , the dynamical display of hidden conservation laws of the hadron system are probably unstable since we expect that the system is not completely integrable , solitary field configurations @xmath41",
    ". then the quantum theory should be able to describe quantum excitations of these fields , i.e. to count the fluctuations of ` curved ' manifolds .",
    "the canonical perturbation theory methods , formulated in terms of creation and annihilation of particles in the external field @xmath41 , are too complicated , see and references cited therein .",
    "for this reason , existing calculations usually do not exceed the semiclassical approximation .",
    "we hope that , as described in appendix k , the quantization scheme would be able to solve this problem ( see also the example described there ) .",
    "another approach assumes that the special ` @xmath42-channel ' ladder type feynman diagrams are able to describe the @xmath15 region .",
    "this approach did not take into account the confinement nonperturbative effects introducing the hardly controllable supposition that the free quarks and gluons may form a complete set of states .",
    "formally this is right , but at all evidence , the decomposition on this fock basis is realized in the non - abelian gauge field theories on zero measure ( see appendix k ) .",
    "nevertheless one may reject this argument assuming that the process is happening on a sufficiently small distances .",
    "corresponding contribution came from the so called ` hard pomeron ' .",
    "but the intrinsic problems of the accuracy of chosen logarithmic approximations , the understanding of the so called non - logarithmic corrections , of the fate of the infrared divergences stay unsolved till now .",
    "so , the multiple production of soft hadron phenomena seems unsolvable on the day - to - day level of understanding and we may with pure conscience move it away .",
    "this is why the hadron inelastic reactions lost some popularity , migrating the last two decades to the class of ` non - interesting ' problems . yet , in a number of modern fundamental experiments , multiple production plays , at least , the role of background to the investigated phenomena and for this reason we should be ready for the quantitative estimation of it .",
    "our hope to describe such a complicated problem as the multiple production phenomenon in the vhm conditions is based on the following idea . at the very",
    "beginning of this century , a couple p. and t.euhrenfest , had offered a model to visualize boltzmann s interpretation of the irreversibility phenomena in statistics .",
    "the model is extremely simple and fruitful .",
    "it considers the two boxes with @xmath43 numerated balls . choosing the label of the balls @xmath44 one must take the ball with the corresponding label from one box and put it into another one .",
    "one may repeat this action an arbitrary number of times @xmath42 .",
    "starting from the highly ` nonequilibrium ' state with all balls in one box , @xmath45 , it is seen stationary with @xmath42 tendency to equalization of the number of balls in the boxes fig.1 .",
    "the stationarity means that the number of balls in the other box rises @xmath46 at least on an early stage of the process .",
    "this signifies presence of an @xmath47 flow ( of balls ) toward the preferable ( equilibrium ) state .",
    "one can hope that this model reflects a physical reality of nonequilibrium processes with initial state very far from equilibrium .",
    "a theory of such processes with ( irreversible ) flow toward a state with maximal entropy should be sufficiently simple being close to the stationary markovian",
    ".    the vhm production process may be , at least on an early stage , stationary markovian .",
    "if this is so then one may neglect long - range effects , non - perturbative as well , since they are not markovian as follows from the experience described in sec.2.1.2 .",
    "this is possible if the vhm process is happening so fast ( being the short - range phenomenon ) that the confinement forces became ` frozen ' .",
    "it can be shown that the quantitative reason for this phenomena is a fast ( exponential ) reduction with @xmath4 of the soft channel contribution into the hadron production process .",
    "so , we expect a change of the multiple production dynamics in the vhm region .    thus , the main input idea consists from two general propositions .",
    "the first of them is following :    ( * i * ) _ the hadron vhm production processes should be close to the stationary markovian .",
    "_    ` freezing ' the confinement constraints , the entropy @xmath8 may exceed for given energy @xmath5 its available maximum in the vhm domain .",
    "then one can assume that the vhm final state is in ` equilibrium ' , or is close to it .",
    "so ,    ( * ii * ) _ the vhm final state should be close to equilibrium _",
    "+ is our second basic proposition",
    ".    we would select and appreciate particle physics models in accordance with these propositions .",
    "the field - theoretical description of statistical systems at a finite temperature is based usually on the formal analogy between imaginary time and inverse temperature @xmath48 .",
    "this analogy is formulated by schwinger as the ` euclidean postulate ' and it assumes that ( i ) the system is in equilibrium , i.e. it should allow the arbitrary rearrangement of states of temporal sequence in the described process , and ( ii ) there is not special space - time long - range correlations among states of the process , i.e , for instance , the symmetry constraints should not play a crucial role . we do not know _ ad hoc _ whether or not to apply the ` euclidean postulate ' for given @xmath4 and @xmath7 , even if ( ) is satisfied .",
    "for this reason we are forced to formulate the theory in the natural real - time terms .    the first important quantitative attempt to build the real - time finite - temperature field theory discovered the formal problem of the so called ` pinch - singularities ' .",
    "further investigation of the theory has allowed to demonstrate the cancellation mechanism of these unphysical singularities .",
    "this is attained by doubling the degrees of freedom : the green functions of the theory represent @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath49 matrix .",
    "it surely makes the theory more complicated , but the operator formalism of the thermo - field dynamics shows the unavoidable character of this complication .",
    "notice that the canonical real - time finite temperature field - theoretical description of the statistical systems based on the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) boundary condition for a field is : ( t)=(t - i ) .",
    "22.1 it , without fail , leads to the @xmath51 fluctuation - dissipation conditions ( see also ) . by this reason",
    "it can not be applied in our case , where the dissipation problem is solved .",
    "the origin of this boundary condition is shown in appendix a.    we will use a more natural microcanonical formalism for particle physics .",
    "the thermodynamical ` rough ' variables are introduced in these approach as the lagrange multipliers of corresponding conservation laws .",
    "the physical meaning of these ` rough ' variables are defined by the corresponding equations of state .",
    "we shall use the @xmath0-matrix approach which is natural for the description of the time evolution .",
    "( the @xmath0-matrix description was used also in . ) for this purpose the amplitudes = a_nm(p , q ) 22.2 of the @xmath52- into @xmath4-particles transition will be introduced .",
    "the in- and out - states must be composed from mass - shell particles . using these amplitudes we will calculate & r_nm(p , q)=|a_nm(p , q)|^2= + & = < p_1,p_2,",
    "... ,p_n|q_1,q_2, ... ,q_m >",
    "< q_1,q_2, ...",
    ",p_n>. 22.3this will lead to the doubling of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the temperature description will be introduced ( see also ) noting that , for instance , & d_n=|a_nm(p , q)|^2d_n(p ) , + & d_n(p)=_1^n ,  ( p)= ( p^2 + m^2)^1/2 , 22.4 is the differential measure of the final state .",
    "it is a first example where the usefulness of the probability - like quantity @xmath53 is seen .",
    "the measure ( ) is defined on the energy - momentum shell : _",
    "i=1^np_i = p .",
    "22.4ait should be underlined that @xmath54 are the translationally invariant amplitudes and four equalities : _",
    "i=1^np_i=_i=1^mq_i 22.4bare obeyed identically .",
    "so , ( ) are the constraints and to take them into account one may multiply @xmath55 on @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the time - like 4-vector . it is evident that integration over @xmath57 with factor @xmath58 gives the constraints ( ) .",
    "one may simplify the calculation assuming that all calculations are performed , for example , in the cm frame @xmath59 .",
    "then one may ignore the space components considering @xmath60 .",
    "this is the equivalent of the assumption that only the energy conservation law is important .",
    "the last step is the substitution @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is our lagrange multiplier . to define its physical meaning",
    "one should solve the equation of state : e =- d_n_k=1^ne^-(p_k)-d_n ( ) .",
    "3such a definition of temperature as the lagrange multiplier of the energy conservation law is obvious for microcanonical description",
    ".    the initial - state temperature will be introduced in the same way , taking into account ( ) .",
    "so , we will construct the two - temperature theory .",
    "it is impossible to use the kms boundary condition in such a two temperatures description ( the equation of state can be applied at the very end of the calculations ) .",
    "it should be notice that the ` density matrix ' @xmath63 , defined in ( [ 22.3 ] ) , describes the ` closed - path motion ' in the functional space .",

    "consequences of the vacuum boundary condition : (_)=0 03aare analyzed .",
    "one should admit also that below boundary conditions are not unique : one can consider arbitrary organization of the environment of the considered system .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix interpretation is able to show the way as an arbitrary boundary condition may be adopted .",
    "this should extend the potentialities of the real - time finite - temperature field - theoretical methods .",
    "it seems useful to illustrate the above microcanonical approach by the simplest example , see also . by definition ,",
    "the @xmath4 particles production cross section _",
    "n(s)=d_n(p)(q_1+q_2-^n_i=1p_i)|a_n(p , q)|^2 , 18where @xmath67 is the ordinary @xmath4 particle production amplitude in accelerator experiments .    considering the fourier transform of energy - momentum conservation @xmath68-function",
    "one can introduce the generating function @xmath69 , see and references cited therein .",
    "we may find in the result that @xmath70 is defined by the equality : _",
    "n(e)=^+i_-ie^e_n ( ) ,   e=(q_1)+(q_2 ) , 3awhere _",
    "n()= \\{^n_i=1 } |a_n|^2=d_n ( ) .",
    "19most probable value of @xmath62 in ( ) is defined by the equation of state ( ) . inserting ( ) into ( )",
    "we find the expression ( ) if the momentum conservation shell is neglected .",
    "the last one is possible since the cross sections are always measured in the definite frame .",
    "let us consider the simplest example of noninteracting particles : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the bessel function . inserting this expression into ( )",
    "we can find that in the nonrelativistic case ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 i.e. , we find the well known equality : e_kin = t , o4where @xmath75 is the mean kinetic energy and @xmath76 is the temperature ( boltzmann constant was taken equal to one ) .",
    "it is important to note that the equation ( ) has a unique real solution @xmath77 rising with @xmath4 and decreasing with @xmath7 .",
    "the expansion of the integral ( ) near @xmath77 unavoidably gives an asymptotic series with zero convergence radii since @xmath78 is the essentially nonlinear function of @xmath62 , see also sec.2.2.2 .",
    "this means that , generally speaking , fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath77 may be arbitrarily high and in this case @xmath77 has no physical sense .",
    "but if the fluctuations are gaussian , then @xmath78 coincides with the partition function of the @xmath4 particle state and @xmath77 may be interpreted as the inverse temperature .",
    "we will put the observation of this important fact in the basis of our thermodynamical description of the vhm region .",
    "the notion of ` equilibrium ' over some parameter @xmath79 in our understanding is a requirement that the fluctuations in the vicinity of its mean value , @xmath80 , have a gaussian character .",
    "notice , in this case , one can use this variable for a ` rough ' description of the system .",
    "we would like to show now that the corresponding equilibrium condition would have the meaning of the correlations relaxation condition of bogolyubov , see also .",
    "let us define the conditions when the fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath81 are gaussian .",
    "firstly , to estimate the integral ( ) in the vicinity of the extremum , @xmath81 , we should expand @xmath82 over @xmath62 :    _ n(+_c)=_n(_c)-+^2 _ n(_c)-^3_n(_c)+ ...",
    "21cand , secondly , expand the exponent in the integral ( ) over , for instance , @xmath83 etc . in the result , if higher terms in ( ) are neglected , @xmath84-th term of the perturbation series _",
    "n , k~\\{}^k ( ) .",
    "22ctherefore , because of euler s @xmath85 function , the perturbation theory near @xmath81 leads to the asymptotic series .",
    "the supposition to define this series formally , for instance , in the borel sense is not interesting from physical point of view .",
    "indeed , such a formal solution assumes that the fluctuations near @xmath81 may be arbitrarily high .",
    "then , by this reason , the value of @xmath81 loses its significance : arbitrary values of @xmath86 are important in this case .",
    "nevertheless it is important to know that our asymptotic series exists in some definite sense , i.e. we can calculate the integral over @xmath62 by expanding it over @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , if the considered series is asymptotic , we may estimate it by first term if /^3_c",
    "< < ( ^2_n(_c)/^2_c)^3/2 . 23cone of the possible solutions of this condition is /^3_c0 .",
    "24cif this condition is satisfied , then the fluctuations are gaussian with dispersion @xmath87 see ( ) .    let us consider now ( ) carefully .",
    "we will find by computing derivatives that this condition means the following approximate equality : -3 + 2 0 , 25cwhere @xmath88 means the @xmath84-th derivative .",
    "for identical particles , ^(k)_n(_c)=n^k(-1)^kd_n(_c)^k_i=1(q_i ) , 26ctherefore , the left hand side of ( ) is the 3-point correlator @xmath89 since @xmath90 is a density of states for given @xmath62 : & k_3d_3(q)(<^3_i=1(q_i)>__c- 3<^2_i=1(q_i)>__c < ( q_3)>__c+ . + & + .2 ^ 3_i=1<(q_i)>__c ) , 27cwhere the index @xmath81 means that averaging is performed with the boltzmann factor @xmath91 .",

    "the vhm process takes place in the vacuum and then it was assumed on the early stages that the multiple production phenomena reflects a natural tendency of the excited hadron system to get to equilibrium with the environment . in this way one can introduce as a first approximation the model that the excited hadron system evolves without any restrictions . in this model",

    "adopting the regge poles notion without its microscopical explanation , this description was self - consistent .",
    "the efforts to extend the regge pole model to the relativistic hadron reactions was ended by the reggeon diagram technique , see and references cited therein , and it was used later to construct the perturbation theory for @xmath70 .",
    "it was shown that the multiplicity distribution is wider then the poissonian because of the multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "the leading energy asymptotics pomeron contribution reflects the created particle kinematics described in appendix d , where the available kinematical scenario in the frame of pqcd are described .",
    "so , the longitudinal momentum of produced particles is large and is strictly ordered .",

    "let us consider the inelasticity coefficient introduced in ( ) @xmath215 , where @xmath9 is the energy of the fastest particle in the laboratory frame .",
    "then the strict ordering of particles in the pomeron kinematics means that @xmath216 is independent of the index of the particle .",
    "so , if the fastest particle has the energy @xmath217 , then the following particle should have the energy @xmath218 , and so on .",

    "we can find that if the number of produced particles is n_0 ,  n_0=-(1-)^2>0 ,  = ( s / m^2 ) , 1.1athen we may expect the total degradation of energy .",

    "this may be interpreted as the direct evidence of fact that the hadron interactions have a large - distance character , i.e. that the interaction radii should be large .",
    "this picture assumes that the probability to have total degradation of energy is ~e^-b^2/4 , 1.3where @xmath229 is some dimensional constant ( the slope of regge trajectory ) and @xmath230 is the 2-dimensional impact parameter .",
    "this formulae has also the explanation connected to the vacuum instability with reference to the real particle production in the strong colour electric field .",
    "the above picture has natural restrictions .",
    "we can assume that each of the produced particles may be the source of above described @xmath42-channel cascade of the energy degradation .",
    "this means that in the frame of the pomeron phenomenology , we are able to describe the production of n <",
    "^2 1.4particles only . if @xmath231 then the density of particles in the diffraction disk becomes large and ( a ) one should introduce short - distance interactions , or ( b ) rise interaction radii .",

    "we wish to formulate once more the main assumptions .",
    "it was assumed first of all that the system under consideration is in equilibrium .",
    "this condition may be naturally reached in the statistics , where one can wait the arbitrary time till the system becomes in equilibrium .",
    "note , in the critical domain , the time of relaxation @xmath414 , @xmath415 , @xmath416 , @xmath417 is the critical temperature",
    ".    we can not give the guarantee that in the high energy hadron collisions the final state system is in equilibrium .",
    "the reason of this uncertainty is the finite time the inelastic processes and presence of hidden ( confinement ) constraints on the dynamics .",
    "but if the confinement forces are frozen in the vhm domain , i.e. the production process is ` fast ' , then the equilibrium may be reached .",
    "we may formulate the quantitative conditions , when the equilibrium is satisfied .",
    "one should have the gaussian energy spectra of created particles .",
    "if this condition is hardly investigated in the experiment , then one should consider the relaxation of ` long - range ' correlations .",
    "this excludes the usage of relaxation condition for the ` short - range ' ( i.e. resonance ) correlation    ( ii ) .",
    "the second condition consists in the requirement that the system should be in the critical domain , where the ( equilibrium ) fluctuations of the system become high . having no theory of hadron interaction at high energies we can not define where lies the ` critical domain ' and even whether it exists or not .",
    "but , having the vhm ` cold ' final state , we can hope that the critical domain is achieved .",
    "the quantitative realization of this picture is given in appendix j. it is important to note that used there the semiclassical approximation is rightfully in the vhm domain .",
    "it seems useful to start the discussion of models outlined the main problems , from authors point of view .",
    "* a. * _ soft colour parton problems _",
    "the infrared region of soft colour parton interactions is a very important problem of high energy hadron dynamics .",
    "such fundamental questions as the infrared divergences of pqcd , collective phenomena in the coloured particles system and symmetry breaking are the phenomena of the infrared domain .",
    "the standard ( most popular ) hadron theory considers pqcd at small distances ( in the scale of @xmath418gev ) as the exact theory .",
    "this statement is confirmed by a number of experiments , namely deep - inelastic scattering data , hard jets observation .",
    "but the pqcd predictions have a finite range of validity since the non - perturbative effects should be taken into account at distances larger then @xmath419 .",
    "it is natural to assume , building the complete theory , that at large distances the non - perturbative effects @xmath420 the perturbative ones . as a result pqcd loses its predictability @xmath421 by the non - perturbative effects .",
    "notice , the pqcd running coupling constant @xmath422 becomes infinite at @xmath423 and we do not know what happens with pqcd if @xmath424 .",
    "there are few possibilities .",
    "for instance , there is a suspicion that at @xmath425 the properties of theory changed so drastically ( being defined on a new vacuum ) that even the notions of pqcd @xmath426 .",
    "this means that pqcd should be truncated from below on the ` fundamental ' scale @xmath427 .",
    "it seems natural that this infrared cut - off would influence the soft hadrons emission .",
    "the new possibility is described in appendix k. this strict formalism allows to conclude that pure pqcd contributions are realized on zero measure , i.e. it is the phenomenological theory only .",
    "the successive approach shows that the yang - mills theory should be described in terms of ( action , angle)-like variables .",
    "the last one means that the self - consistent description excludes such notions as the ` gluon ' . as a result of",
    "this substitution new perturbation theory would be free from infrared divergences , i.e. there is not necessity to introduce the infrared cutoff parameter @xmath427 .",
    "( moreover , in the sector of vector fields ( without quarks ) the theory is ultraviolet stable . )",
    "it seems important for this reason to investigate experimentally just vhm events , where the soft colour partons production is dominant .",
    "it is important to try to raise the role of pqcd in the ` forbidden ' area of large distances .",
    "the vhm processes are at highly unusual condition , where the non - perturbative effects must be negligible .",
    "* b*. _ dissipation problems _    the highly nonequilibrium states decay ( thermalization ) which means in the pqcd terms that the process of vhm formation should be enhanced , at least in asymptotics over multiplicity and energy , by jets .",
    "it is the general conclusion of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and it means that the very nonequilibrium initial state tends to equilibrium ( thermalized ) as fast as possible .",
    "the entropy @xmath428 of a system is proportional to the number of created particles and , therefore , @xmath428 should tend to its maximum in the vhm region .",
    "but the maximum of entropy testifies also the equilibrium of the system .",
    "* c*. _ collective phenomena _",
    "we should underline that the collective phenomena may take place if and only if the particles interaction energy is comparable to the kinetic one .",
    "the vhm system considered may be ` cold ' and ` equilibrium ' . for this reason the vhm state",
    "is mostly adopted for investigation of collective phenomena .",
    "one of possible states in which the collective effects , see a.g . , may be important is the ` could coloured plasma ' .",
    "the fundamental interest presents the problem of vacuum structure of yang - mills theory .",
    "for instance , if the process of cooling is ` fast ' , since the dissipation process of vhm final state formation should be as fast as possible , then one may consider formation of vacuum domains with various properties",
    ". then decay of these domains may lead to large fluctuations , for instance , of the isotopic spin .",
    "another important question is the collective phenomena in the vhm final state .",
    "the last one may be created ` perturbatively ' , for instance , by the formation of heavy jets . then the colour charges should be confined .",
    "there are various predictions about this process .",
    "one of them predicts that there should be a first order phase transition .",
    "now we can ask : what can models say concerning the above problems ?    * a*. _ soft coloured partons production _",
    "the multiperipheral models predict fast decreasing of topological cross section in the vhm domain @xmath429 , @xmath430 . at the same time",
    "the mean transverse momentum should @xmath431 in this domain since the interaction radii should ` increase ' with @xmath4 .",
    "the bfkl pomeron predicts the same asymptotics , @xmath430 , but the pqcd jet predicts @xmath166 .",
    "the @xmath22 attempt to insert into the bfkl pomeron the production of particles via ( mini)jets seems impossible .",
    "this ` insertion ' can be done into the dis ladder but investigation of the lla kinematics in the vhm domain allows the conclusion that the ` low - x ' contributions should be taken into account .",
    "all this experience allows the assumption that in the vhm domain no ` @xmath42-channel ladder ' diagrams play sufficient role .",
    "this means the existence of a transition to the processes with jet dominance .",
    "the pqcd is unable to predict the transition mechanism .",
    "* b*. _ transition into equilibrium _",
    "if the @xmath42-channel ladders are ` destroyed ' in the vhm region , then jets , despite the small factor @xmath432 in the cross sections , are the only mechanism of particle production in the vhm domain .",
    "dominance of heavy jets in the vhm domain may naturally explain the tendency towards equilibrium .",
    "but the description of thermalization in terms of jets of massless gluons production destroy this hope : the jet contribution @xmath166 assumes ` bremsstrahlung ' of @xmath433 gluons .",
    "this prevents the equilibrium since ordering without fail introduce the non - relaxing correlations .",
    "* c*. _ collective phenomena _",
    "considering the collective phenomena , we proposer to distinguish ( a ) the collective phenomena connected with the vacuum and ( b ) the collective phenomena produced in the vhm system . following the experience of sec.3.3 we can conclude that the signal of vacuum instability is inequality : @xmath434 .",
    "the case ( b ) will not effect the cross section @xmath70 .",
    "but if the system became equilibrium in the vhm domain then the collective phenomena may be investigated using ordinary thermodynamical methods . for instance , noting that @xmath435 is the free energy one can measure the thermal capacity ( _ c , z)=c(_c , z ) . o23then",
    ", comparing capacities of hadron and @xmath436-quanta systems we can say whether or not the phase transition happened .",
    "the connection of the equilibrium and relaxation of correlations is well known .",
    "continuing this idea , if the vhm system is in equilibrium one may assume that the colour charges in the pre - confinement phase of vhm event form the plasma .",
    "one should note here that the expected plasma is ` cold ' and ` dense ' .",
    "for this reason no long - range confinement forces would act among colour charges . then , being ` cold ' , in such a system various , collective phenomena may be important .",
    "the experimental possibilities in the vhm domain are not clear up to now .",
    "nevertheless first steps toward formulation of trigger system was done , see . by this reason we would like to restrict ourselves by following two general questions .",
    "it seems that these questions are mostly important being in the very beginning of vhm theory .",
    "0.3 cm * i*. _ for what values of multiplicity at a given energy the vhm processes become hard _ ?",
    "+ the answer to this question depends on the value of the incident energy .",
    "if we know the answer then it will appear possible to estimate     the role of multiperipheral contributions ,     the jet production rate ,     the role of vacuum instabilities .",
    "it seems that the experimental answer to this question is absent since produced particles are soft , theirs mean transverse and longitudinal momenta have the same value . in our understanding",
    "this question means : the total transverse energy may be extremely high .",
    "it is interesting also to search the heavy jets , i.e. to observe the fluctuations of particle density in the event - by - event experiment , but this program seems vague since , for all evidence , fractal dimensions tend to zero with increasing multiplicities .    0.3 cm * ii*. _ for what values of multiplicity does the vhm final state become equilibrium _ ?",
    "+ we hope that having answer on this question we would be able     to investigate the status of pqcd ,     to observe the phase transition phenomena directly ,     to estimate the role of confinement constraints .",
    "the equilibrium means that the energy correlation functions mean values are small .",
    "it is interesting also , for example , the charge equilibrium , when the mean value of charge correlation functions are small .",
    "notice , the effect of the phase space boundary may lead to ` equilibrium ' . indeed ,",
