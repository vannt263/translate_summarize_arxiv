    "fixed point algorithms are among the most effective algorithms for phase retrieval .",
    "these include douglas - rachford ( dr ) algorithm @xcite , hybrid - projection - reflection ( hpr ) algorithm @xcite and the difference map ( dm ) @xcite , all of which are based on the projections onto the constraint sets , including the object domain constraints ( positivity , support constraint etc ) and the fourier magnitude constraint .",
    "their performance is on a par with the industry standard such as the hybrid - input - output ( hio ) algorithm @xcite which is not of the pure projection type and notoriously hard to analyze @xcite .",
    "the numerical challenge to any phasing algorithms is two - fold : the possibility of multiple fixed points and the non - convexity of the fourier magnitude constraint .",
    "the latter is the nature of phase retrieval , independent of algorithms , while the former depends on the information content of the measured data as well as the design of algorithm .",
    "the behaviors of any fixed point algorithm depend on the  landscape \" of the object domain .",
    "if there are multiple attractive fixed points , the iterations can stagnate ; if there are multiple hyperbolic fixed points , then a strange attractor may emerge and the iterations may exhibit a chaotic behavior . in other words ,",
    "the presence of multiple fixed point in the object domain often severely deteriorate numerical performance , causing stagnation or even divergence of the iterations .    on the other hand , the presence of multiple fixed points in the fourier domain may not be a bad thing , as long as these fixed points correspond to the unique fixed point in the object domain .",
    "on the contrary , the presence of multiple fixed points in the fourier domain is a form of relaxation and may help mitigate the stagnation problem",
    ".    therefore uniqueness of the fixed point in the object domain is a first - order concern to the algorithm design just like uniqueness of phase retrieval solution is to the measurement design .",
    "the latter , however , is the prerequisite of the former .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to formulate the 3-parameter family of dm in the _ fourier domain with two oversampled coded diffraction patterns _ , but without any object domain constraint , and prove the uniqueness of fixed point after proper projection back to the object domain .",
    "the motivation for coded measurement is to the uniqueness of phase retrieval solution as established in @xcite and the tremendous enhancement in numerical performance illustrated in @xcite .",
    "let us first review the set - up for coded diffraction patterns .",
    "let @xmath0 be a discrete object function with @xmath1 . consider the object space consisting of all functions supported in @xmath2 we assume @xmath3 .    with a coherent illumination under the fraunhofer approximation",
    ", the free - space propagation between the object plane and the sensor plane can be described by the fourier transform @xcite ( with the proper coordinates and normalization ) .",
    "however , only the _ intensities _ of the fourier transform are measured on the sensor plane and constitute the so called _ diffraction pattern _ given by _ = -^ _ f(+ ) e^-2,=(w_1,,w_d)^d,= ( n_1,,n_d ) which is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation r_f()=_f(+ ) . here and below the over - line notation means complex conjugacy .    note that @xmath4 is defined on the enlarged grid @xmath5 whose cardinality is roughly @xmath6 times that of @xmath7 . hence by sampling the diffraction pattern on the grid = \\{(w_1,,w_d )  |  w_j = 0 , , , , } we can recover the autocorrelation function by the inverse fourier transform .",
    "this is the _ standard oversampling _ with which the diffraction pattern and the autocorrelation function become equivalent via the fourier transform .",
    "the remaining task is to recover @xmath8 from its autocorrelation function , the object domain constraints and the knowledge of @xmath9 .",
    "a coded diffraction pattern is measured with a mask whose effect is multiplicative and results in a _ masked object _ of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an array of random variables representing the mask . in other words , a coded diffraction pattern is just the plain diffraction pattern of a masked object .    we will focus on the effect of _ random phases _",
    "@xmath12 in the mask function @xmath13 where @xmath12 are independent , continuous real - valued random variables and @xmath14 ( i.e. the mask is transparent ) .",
    "accordingly , let @xmath15 be the oversampled discrete fourier transform from @xmath7 to @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "in other words , @xmath15 is an isometry and has orthonormal columns .    in the case of one",
    "masked measurement , the measurement matrix is @xmath18 whereas in the case of two masked measurements , the measurement matrix is given by = 1,_j=  ( _ j),j=1,2 . [ 0.0 ] where @xmath19 are two independently generated masks .",
    "let @xmath20 be the mask - coded diffraction pattern(s ) .",
    "now we recall the uniqueness of phase retrieval solution with two coded diffraction patterns @xcite .",
    "@xcite [ prop1 ] let @xmath8 be a complex - valued object of dimension @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the matrix given by .",
    "let @xmath23 be another complex object satisfying @xmath24 on @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath25 , for some real constant @xmath26 , with probability one .",
    "for ease of presentation , we shall assume that the masks are _",
    "phase masks _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 . consequently , @xmath28 .    for ease of notation",
    ", we convert the @xmath29-dimensional grid into an ordered set of index . for example , the unknown object @xmath30 is the vectorized version of the object function @xmath8 originally supported in @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the component - wise multiplication and division between two vectors @xmath34 , respectively . for any @xmath35 define the phase vector @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 . when @xmath39 the phase can be assigned arbitrarily and we set @xmath40 unless otherwise specified .",
    "phase retrieval can be formulated as the following feasibility problem in the fourier domain [ feas ] y,:= \\{y^|| : |y|=b}.    let @xmath41 be the projection onto @xmath42 and @xmath43 the projection onto @xmath44 : [ proj ] y=^ * y , y = b the difference map ( dm ) @xmath45 is defined as follows .",
    "let = i+[dm ] with & = & ( ( 1+_2)-_2 i)-((1+_1)-_1 i)[dm2 ] where @xmath46 are three relaxation parameters .",
    "when @xmath47 and @xmath48 , [ hpr ] = i+(((1 + 1)-1i)- ) fdm becomes fhpr which , with @xmath49 , becomes fdr : [ dr ] s y & = & y+^ * ( 2b - y)-b .",
    "fdm is so designed that its fourier fixed points become the phase retrieval solution after proper projection .",
    "let @xmath50 be a fixed point of and hence satisfy @xmath51 , i.e. [ 2 ] ( ( 1+_2)-_2 i)y_*= ( ( 1+_1)-_1 i)y_*. let [ 3]v_*&&((1+_1)-_1i ) y _ * + [ 4]_*&&((1+_2)-_2 i)y _ * and y_*,x^ * y=^*_*. [ 4.1 ] by @xmath52 and hence @xmath53 satisfies both the object domain constraint represented by @xmath41 as well as the fourier domain constraint represented by @xmath43 .        * @xmath56 and @xmath57 for some real constant @xmath26 . * if @xmath58 and @xmath47 , then @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for some real constant @xmath26 . *",
    "if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 for some real constant @xmath26 .    part ( i ) means that in general @xmath53 , instead of @xmath50 , is unique up to a constant phase factor .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath63 is nonlinear .",
    "for example , @xmath64 and @xmath50 are already related pixel - wise via the complicated relationship |_*|&= &            by proposition [ prop1 ] and , implies [ 10.1 ] y = e^i y_0 for some real constant @xmath26 with probability one .",
    "this proves part ( i ) . for part ( ii ) , substituting into , we have e^i y_0&=&(1+_2 ) y_*-_2y_*.[10.3 ] on the other hand , implies that [ 10.2 ] y = v_*=y _ * , under the assumption @xmath47 , and hence @xmath73 .        [ prop2 ] @xcite let @xmath75 be a given rank @xmath21 object . if [ mag ] x = x_0 ( after proper adjustment of the angles wherever the coded diffraction patterns vanish ) , then almost surely @xmath76 for some positive constant @xmath77 ."
