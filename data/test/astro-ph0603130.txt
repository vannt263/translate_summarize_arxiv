    "the bulge of our galaxy hosts a variety of x - ray and @xmath0-ray point sources ( e.g. , knight et al .  1985 , skinner et al .",
    "1987 , churazov et al .  1994",
    "; see , e.g. , bird et al .  2006 ,",
    "blanger et al .",
    "2006 , revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 , for _ integral _ observations ) .",
    "these include persistent and transient neutron star and black - hole candidate binaries , x - ray pulsars , x - ray bursters , etc .. because of the variability these sources possess on time scales of msec to days ( quasi - periodic oscillations , pulsations , [ absorption ] dips , eclipses , type i and type ii x - ray bursts , orbital variations , flares ) and weeks to years ( orbital variations , outburst cycles , on / off states ) , the region never looks exactly the same .    from 17 february 2005",
    "onwards _ integral _ has been monitoring this region approximately every 3 days , as part of our approved ao-3 program , whenever the region is visible by _ integral_. in this paper we describe this program in more detail and show the first results of the first two periods of monitoring performed between february and october 2005 .",
    "_ integral _ ( the * inte*rnational * g*amma-*r*ay * a*strophysics * l*aboratory ; winkler et al .",
    "2003 ) is an esa scientific mission dedicated to fine spectroscopy ( @xmath1@xmath2500 ; spi ) and fine imaging ( angular resolution : 12 arcmin fwhm ; ibis ) of celestial @xmath0-ray sources in the energy range 15kev to 10mev with simultaneous monitoring in the x - ray ( 335kev ; jem - x ) and optical ( v - band , 550 nm ; omc ) energy ranges .",
    "our program is to observe the region frequently and regularly , with the aim to investigate the source variability and transient activity on time scales of days to weeks to months at relatively soft ( @xmath310kev ) and hard ( @xmath410kev ) energies .",
    "one complete hexagonal dither pattern ( 7 pointings of 1800sec each , i.e. , 1 on - axis pointing , 6 off - source pointings in a hexagonal pattern around the nominal target location , each 2@xmath5 apart ) is performed during each _ integral _ revolution , or orbit around the earth ( i.e. , roughly every 3 days ) .",
    "this is done whenever the region is visible by _ integral _ ( about two times per year for a total period of about 4 months ) . as a service to the scientific community ,",
    "the jem - x light curves ( 310kev and 1025kev ) and the ibis / isgri light curves ( 2060kev and 60150kev ) are made publicly available as soon as possible after the observations are performed . in addition , ibis/ isgri and jem - x mosaic images of each hexagonal observation are provided , with information on the detected sources .",
    "last , but not least , all ibis / isgri 2060kev mosaic images per revolution are stacked into a movie , showing the ever - changing gamma - ray sky .",
    "all the instruments onboard _ integral _ , except the omc , have coded masks . with the fully and partially coded field of views ( fovs ) we cover about half of the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) and high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) galactic bulge population",
    "( see also , e.g. , in t zand 2001 ) .",
    "similar galactic bulge monitoring programs have been performed ( see , e.g. , in t zand 2001 ) and are currently ongoing ( e.g. , _ rxte _ galactic bulge scans , swank &  markwardt 2001 ) . however",
    ", the _ rxte_/pca and hexte do only have a 2@xmath5 collimator , so only a small field of view with no imaging resolution , and therefore only provide information on a given source for a short time when the instrument scans over it ; moreover , in the galactic center region itself there is some source confusion .",
    "there are currently other instruments in operation at similar energy ranges ( e.g. , _",
    "swift_/bat : 15150kev with a fov of 2 steradians ; barthelmy 2000 ) , but they do not provide frequent and regular monitoring of the galactic bulge region , as well as having a worse imaging capability , again leading to some source confusion in the galactic center region ( _ swift_/bat psf angular resolution is 22 compared to the ibis / isgri angular resolution of 12 [ fwhm ] ) .    for our program at the moment we only consider data from ibis / isgri ( ubertini et al .",
    "2003 , lebrun et al .",
    "2003 ) and jem - x ( lund et al .",
    "we do not consider the data from the ibis / picsit , spi , or omc instruments .",
    "either the angular resolution is high ( spi : 2.5@xmath5 ) and therefore the various sources in the galactic bulge region close to each other complicate the analysis , or the sources are too weak to be detected ( ibis / picsit ) . for the omc ,",
    "however , we are currently evaluating the scientific output .",
    "the _ integral _ data reduction is performed using the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ; courvoisier et al .",
    "2003 ) , v5.1 .",
    "we use a source catalog , currently containing 79 sources which have been detected by ibis / isgri up to now in the field we are interested in ( but see next section ) .",
    "the data from ibis / isgri are processed until the production of images in the 2060 and 60150kev energy ranges per single exposure .",
    "we force the flux extraction of each of the catalogue sources , regardless of the detection significance of the source .",
    "this method is essential in order to clean the images from the ghosts of all the active sources in the field , but does not make any threshold selection and all the positive fluxes are recorded . in order to detect fainter sources",
    ", we then mosaic the images from the single exposures and search for all catalog sources , as well as possible new ones . for jem - x",
    "the analysis is run through the imaging step to the light - curve step in osa for a single bin of the same length as the exposure window .",
    "light curves are produced for all catalog sources up to 5@xmath5 off from the center of the fov .",
    "again , the images from the single exposures are mosaiced in order to create the final image ( but no further source detection was done ) .    per hexagonal dither ( i.e. , 7 exposures combined ) we are sensitive down to typically between 5 and 15mcrab ( 6@xmath6 ) for both jem - x and ibis / isgri .",
    "the actual sensitivity depends on factors such as source position ( fully or partially coded fov ) , background ( instrument systematics , solar activity ) , number of exposures ( some are lost ) and energy ( instrument response ) .",
    "the results , as well as more information about the program , can be retrieved from the _ integral _ galactic bulge monitoring www page hosted at the isdc in switzerland : http://isdc.unige.ch / science / bulge/.",
    "by now we have had two full seasons of monitoring , i.e. , from revolutions 287307 ( 2005 february - april ) and 347370 ( 2005 august - october ) , respectively .",
    "the third season started in revolution 406 ( february 2006 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show examples of results from the first two seasons for various types of sources . at the left",
    "we show the light curves of ( temporary ) bright ( i.e. , easily detected in one exposure ) sources . at the right",
    "we show the light curves of weaker ( persistent or transient ) or slowly varying sources , averaged per revolution .    whereas , for example , gx3 + 1 ( neutron star lmxb ) does not vary much",
    ", sources like gx1 + 4 ( symbiotic binary containing a neutron star ) and 1a1742@xmath7294 ( neutron star lmxb ) vary on monthly times scales , while 1e1740.7@xmath72942 ( lmxb ) varies smoothly on even longer time scales .",
    "some sources clearly show transient behaviour , i.e. , they show outbursts with durations exceeding months ( e.g. , h1743@xmath7322 , a black - hole candidate lmxb ; see also below ) or flaring on timescales of hours to days ( e.g. , igrj17252@xmath73616 , an x - ray pulsar hmxb ) .",
    "some sources vary on all timescales accessible through our program , as displayed by the hmxb 4u1700@xmath7377 .",
    "similarly , sources like 1a1742@xmath7289 and 1e1742.2@xmath72857 ( both unidentified x - ray sources ) show low - level activity on various timescales .",
    "sources like the neutron star lmxb transients saxj1747.0@xmath72853 and xtej1739@xmath7285 showed renewed outburst activity , during the second season ( see also below ) .",
    "the neutron star lmxbs 4u1724@xmath730 ( in the globular cluster terzan  2 ) and 4u1820@xmath7303 have been persistently on through the seasons , displaying occasionally drops or flares , respectively , in intensity for about a month .",
    "the neutron star lmxb gs1826@xmath724 slowly varied through our observing periods .",
    "so far quick - look results during the two seasons have been reported in 10 atel s . here",
    "we describe some of the highlights . precisely at the start of the program",
    "the black - hole x - ray transient groj1655@xmath740 was reported to become active ( markwardt &  swank 2005 ) .",
    "the _ integral _ groj1655@xmath740 light curves ( see kuulkers et al .",
    "2005a ) nicely complement observations at soft x - ray ( _ rxte _ ; see homan 2005 ) and radio ( _ vla _ ; see rupen et al .",
    "2005 ) wavelengths .",
    "various other transient sources popped up and faded away , such as the rapid burster , h1743@xmath7322 ( both kretschmar et al .",
    "2005 ; for h1743@xmath7322 see figure 1 , left ) , igrj17098@xmath73628 ( mowlavi et al .  2005 ) , saxj1747.0@xmath72853 ( kuulkers et al .  2005b ; see figure 1 , right ) and xtej1818@xmath7245 ( shaw et al .",
    "2005a ) . in 2005",
    "august , the x - ray transient xtej1739@xmath7285 was found by _",
    "integral _ to be bright at soft and not detected at hard x - ray energies ( bodghee et al .",
    "about a month later the situation had reversed ; it was bright at hard and weak at soft x - ray energies ( shaw et al .",
    "2005b ; see figure 1 , right ) .",
    "although at first we attributed the state change to the compact object being a black hole , we proved it to be a neutron star based on the occurrence of type i x - ray bursts detected with jem - x ( brandt et al .",
    "we have shown that most of the sources in the program in the field of view of the _ integral _ instruments clearly vary on timescales of a few hours to days to months ; it is therefore of no surprise that the galactic bulge is a region to stay tuned on .",
    "mirax with its wide - field instruments covering a similar energy range ( braga et al .  2004",
    "; see also these proceedings ) will go a step further , i.e. , it will _ continuously _ monitor the galactic bulge region for about 9 months per year down to a sensitivity level of @xmath25mcrab per day .",
    "our monitoring program is , therefore , also an ideal ` training session ' for what to expect with mirax .",
    "based on observations with _ integral _ , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa ."
