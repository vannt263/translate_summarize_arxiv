    "the qcd vacuum is a non - perturbative system , and makes it difficult to study the physics of the strong interaction . since the early stage of the study of qcd , the mit bag model has been one of popular models of hadrons @xcite .",
    "there , the inside of the bag is assumed to be a perturbative space , and the quark dynamics is treated perturbatively with much success @xcite . furthermore by requiring chiral symmetry , the bag model was shown to have a pion cloud @xcite .",
    "the chirally symmetric coupling between pions and quarks at the bag surface gives a conservation of the axial vector current .",
    "however , the strong pion - quark coupling causes an instability of the bag itself @xcite . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "a skyrmion was introduced outside of the bag , whose model setup is called as the chiral bag model .",
    "other extensions , such as the cloudy bag model @xcite , the chiral bag model with vector mesons @xcite , are also useful models .    in the qcd vacuum ,",
    "chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and the constituent quark mass is induced dynamically @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative structure of the vacuum in the bag is a long standing problem @xcite .",
    "contrary to the original expectation , it is interesting to see that the vacuum structure inside the bag may become nontrivial , where quark and gluon condensates may take finite values due to the boundary conditions . in the chiral bag ,",
    "the pion cloud is also a source for non - perturbative nature inside the bag , since the pions and quarks interact with each other strongly @xcite .",
    "for instance , the quark scalar condensate has a finite value @xmath0 in the mit bag model @xcite and also in the chiral bag model @xcite .",
    "it is comparable to the observed value @xmath1 as given in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the other approaches .",
    "therefore , it would be a natural question whether the non - perturbative vacuum is induced by the boundary conditions or some dynamical interactions such as the njl one .    in this paper , to understand the non - perturbative dynamics in the bag , the njl interaction is introduced as a quark - quark interaction inside the chiral bag @xcite .",
    "this approach is justified when the color confinement is caused by long range gluon dynamics at distance @xmath2 fm , while the chiral symmetry breaking occurs at shorter distance scale @xmath3 fm , as suggested by instanton dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed such a separation of the length scales has been considered in the context of the njl model in the hadron dynamics @xcite . in recent approaches based on ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "it is suggested that there is a window of the gauge coupling where chiral symmetry breaking occurs in a deconfinement phase @xcite .",
    "further analysis for the hybrid model of the njl model and the chiral bag model , which may be called as the njl chiral bag model , was given in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the strong pion - quark coupling in the chiral bag causes the chiral vacuum polarization inside the bag @xcite .",
    "familiar examples are the conservation of baryon number and the chiral casimir energy @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the njl chiral bag with finite quark mass also holds the properties of the vacuum polarization @xcite .    in the previous studies of the njl bag model @xcite , only the scalar condensate was considered . however",
    ", this channel causes a divergence of the chiral casimir energy in the limit of zero bag radius . in the present work",
    ", we will show that a self - consistent solution can be found with finite quark condensates for the baryon number @xmath4 system by considering not only the scalar channel but also the pseudoscalar channel .",
    "the latter channel is required by the hedgehog ansatz in the pion sector . in this way",
    ", we can study the quark condensates inside hadrons ( quark bag ) by both quark boundary conditions ( chiral casimir effects ) and the self - consistency condition from the njl interaction .",
    "we evaluate the quark condensates as mode sums in the chiral bag model without introducing a cutoff as in the ordinary njl model .",
    "we consider this as a counter representation of the long - range dynamics with a cutoff , which is valid inside the chiral bag .    in this paper , in order to avoid numerical complications of the 1 + 3 dimensional model , instead , we consider a 1 + 1 dimensional system with the gross - neveu model @xcite in analogy with the realistic case . in this way",
    ", we expect to learn essential non - trivial dynamics of the njl interaction inside the bag . in our model , quarks are confined in a finite segment of the line in a u(1 ) @xmath5 u(1 ) chirally symmetric way .",
    "this simplification has an advantage that an analytical calculation can be performed .",
    "such a model setup does not modify the qualitative feature of the chiral vacuum polarization in the realistic 1 + 3 dimensional bag .",

    "@xmath112 and 0 are represented by thick lines and thin lines , respectively . as seen in the conventional chiral bag model ( @xmath127 )",
    ", the pion energy is dominant rather than the quark energy for small bag radius , and vice versa for large bag radius .",
    "the former gives the skyrmion , and the latter gives the mit bag .",
    "the dominance of each contribution is clearly seen as the njl coupling constant is switched on ; the pion dominates for @xmath128 fm and the quark dominates for @xmath129 fm .",
    "note that the total energy becomes rather independent of the bag radius @xmath60 when the volume term @xmath130 with a suitable value of the bag constant @xmath131 .",

    "although the direct comparison of the coefficients does not make much sense , qualitative agreement between the two results indicates that we can proceed further discussions about quark condensates in a formalism of the njl chiral bag model .",
    "previously , it was discussed by kunihiro to employ the njl model inside the chiral bag @xcite . there the strong @xmath135 field is considered to cause the chiral symmetry breaking in the bag . in our discussion , the dynamical quark mass in the empty bag takes a maximum value at the chiral angle @xmath74 and @xmath55 as shown by the dashed line in fig .",

    "the hedgehog ansatz is employed for the mean fields of the quarks and pions .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar densities are defined as mean fields with the chiral angle in a self - consistent way .",
    "these quark condensates are then computed explicitly as mode sums in the chiral bag .",
    "solutions of the mean field equation leads to the generation of the dynamical quark mass . as a chiral vacuum polarization , conservation of baryon number",
    "is shown to be valid for finite quark condensate .",
    "the chiral casimir energy is also shown to be well defined without divergence .",
    "there it is important that the symmetry of the single quark spectrum is conserved by the chiral phase .",
    "consequently , the njl chiral bag connects smoothly the finite size bag and the skyrmion as the cheshire cat picture implies .",
    "we emphasize that , without the chiral phase , the smooth behavior is not obtained for massive quarks @xcite .",
    "the generation of dynamical quark mass in a bag supports the previous conjectures that the non - perturbative dynamics of quarks and gluons remain inside the bag @xcite .",
    "it suggests us to reconsider the original picture of the mit bag model in which a perturbative space is assumed inside the bag .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the relevance to the recent observation in the rhic experiments which indicate strong quark correlation with finite mass at temperature higher than @xmath136 . in order to have clear picture for non - perturbative dynamics of the bag",
