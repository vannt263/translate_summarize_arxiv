    "the dynamics of most real world systems is very complex and can be analyzed by considering them as many sub - systems or units interacting with each other . such systems then can be modeled by complex networks of diverse topologies chosen to suit their collective behavior .",
    "it is now well established that the interaction among the sub - systems can lead to emergent phenomena like synchronization and amplitude or oscillator death @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the global dynamics depends on the interplay between the network structure and nodal dynamics .",
    "however , the interactions of complex networks with environment , such as an external agency or medium , and the consequent emergent dynamics are not studied yet . in the case of quantum systems ,",
    "the role of environment in causing decoherence , relaxation , and dissipation is well studied @xcite . in the context of biological systems ,",
    "the environment can play a constructive role as the mechanism for triggering or signaling coordinated rhythms @xcite . hence it is important and relevant to study the effect of environment on the dynamics of coupled systems .    among the emergent phenomena in coupled systems , the suppression of dynamics or amplitude death is often a useful control mechanism for stabilizing systems to steady states .",
    "it is an important self organized behavior that can play crucial roles in regulating , switching , and controlling physical @xcite , chemical @xcite , and biological systems @xcite . in this context ,",
    "amplitude death ( ad ) refers to the phenomenon where the coupled or interacting sub - systems settle to a steady state in which dynamics is quenched .    in the context of regularly coupled systems",
    ", it has been shown that amplitude death can be induced by different mechanisms , such as parameter mismatch @xcite , time - delay coupling @xcite , conjugate coupling @xcite , attractive and repulsive couplings @xcite , and dynamical coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of amplitude death in regularly coupled systems , there has been a few recent studies on amplitude death in complex networks . in the specific context of networks ,",
    "amplitude death has been studied for parameter mismatch or detuning of frequencies in an ensemble of limit cycle oscillators with mean field coupling @xcite , array of limit cycle oscillators @xcite , small - world networks @xcite , and scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "so also , time - delay in coupling is found to induce amplitude death in networks of limit - cycle oscillators @xcite and chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that it is possible to target amplitude death in a network of nonlinear oscillators by a proper choice of nonlinear coupling @xcite .    in this paper , we present an interesting phenomenon in which the collective dynamics of coupled systems is quenched due to an interaction with an environment or external agency . for this , we model the average effect of the environment by an over - damped oscillator which is kept alive with feedback from the subunits .",
    "we find that while the coupling among the units can give rise to a synchronizing tendency , the coupling through the environment has a tendency to drive the systems to a state where the sum of the variables is small .",
    "the combined effect of these two tendencies is to lead the coupled systems to the state of amplitude death .",
    "our method has the advantage that it involves a single damped dynamical system coupled to all nodes equally and hence the design procedure is simple and easy to implement .",
    "it is found to be effective in complex networks of different topologies .",
    "we have found this mechanism to be quite general and effective in inducing amplitude death in two systems coupled by different types of coupling and of different intrinsic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the present study generalizes the previous results in two directions .",
    "first , we consider a complex network of @xmath0 systems and develop the stability analysis following the approach given in ref .",
    "the stability conditions are obtained for the general case .",
    "second , we consider different network structures .",
    "our results are supplemented by detailed numerical analysis where indices of amplitude death are computed directly from simulations . for numerical simulations ,",
    "we use rssler as a standard system in its chaotic region .",
    "however , we have tried this method for landau - stuart oscillators and the hindmarsh - rose model of neurons and found it to be effective in causing amplitude death .",
    "an important finding from our study is that , the critical strength of coupling needed for amplitude death has a universal relation with the largest non - zero eigenvalue of the coupling matrix which is tested for many symmetric networks like chain , ring , tree , lattice , all - to - all , star , and random topologies .",
    "we consider the dynamics of @xmath0 systems @xmath1 , in a network , coupled with two types of couplings , namely , a direct diffusive coupling and an indirect coupling through an environment as an extension of the model given in ref .",

    "the environment is considered to be a one - dimensional over - damped oscillator @xmath18 , with damping parameter @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that without feedback from the systems , the environment can not remain dynamic and will rapidly settle to a steady state .",
