    "long - lived charged massive particles ( champs ) can exist in various extensions of the standard model of particle physics such as supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "one of such example is a slepton , a superpartner of leptons , which can be stable if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and r - parity is conserved .",
    "however , the abundance of such stable charged massive particles would be severely constrained @xcite , in particular , from experiments of the deep sea water @xcite .",
    "although there might have been a mechanism to prevent them being captured into the earth  @xcite and in such a case the constraints may not be applicable , a scenario with stable champs would generally not be viable .",
    "however , in some other scenarios , champs are unstable , and they can constitute a dominant component of non - relativistic particles in the early universe .",
    "for example , when the gravitino is the lsp , which can be easily realized in gauge - mediated susy breaking models @xcite , the next lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsp ) may be champs , and they can be long - lived .",
    "although such unstable champs can evade the constraint from the sea water , they affect other aspects of cosmology .",
    "it has been rigorously investigated that the decay of such massive particles would destroy light elements synthesized by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , from which we obtain constraints on the properties of champs such as the decay rate and its abundance @xcite .",
    "although the considerations of the decay also applies to neutral massive particles , there is another important effect on bbn which is specific to the charged particles : the bound - state effect .",
    "negative champs can form a bound state with positively charged light elements , which affects the bbn reaction rates and their abundances @xcite .",
    "in fact , as will be shown later , most negative champs ( referred to as @xmath5 ) are captured by @xmath6he , a double - positively charged element .",
    "if this bound state @xmath7 is stable for some time in the course of the history of the universe , it would also affect other aspects of cosmology in addition to bbn such as large scale structure .",
    "thus a detailed investigation of how the bound states are formed and evolve would be important and interesting , which is one of the main topics in this paper .",
    "when a particle possesses an electric charge before recombination , it is tightly coupled with the plasma of electrons and photons .",
    "thus such charged particles , which are supposed to be the bound state @xmath8 here , can also participate in the acoustic oscillations .",
    "when the bound state of negative champs constitutes a dominant component of non - relativistic particles , fluctuations of ( non - relativistic ) matter can not grow due to the  acoustic damping \" caused by the acoustic oscillations , which is different from the case with a standard neutral cold - dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "this results in the suppression of the matter power spectrum at some scales @xcite .",
    "thus the bound state @xmath7 should have a significant effect on large scale structure , and the consideration of this issue can place a unique bound on the properties of ( negative ) champs , which is another topic we are going to focus in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we first carefully investigate the evolution of the bound states of @xmath9 with some light elements by numerically solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "then we discuss the effect of the ( charged ) bound state on large scale structure and the damping of matter power spectrum . in section",
    "[ sec : const ] , we discuss the constraint on the property of champs from large scale structure and some other aspects such as bbn and the cmb spectrum .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary of this paper .",
    "unless otherwise stated , throughout this paper @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the number density , the mass and the yield variable ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 the entropy density ) of a particle @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the bound - state formation of @xmath5 with a light element , which occurs after the cosmic temperature becomes lower than 30 kev . until that time",
    ", most of the standard bbn processes should have almost been finished . under this circumstance ,",
    "the boltzmann equations for the time - evolution of the number density of bound states @xmath16 , denoted as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19he are expressed by @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\    & & +   \\langle \\sigma_{{\\rm ex } } v \\rangle      ( n_{\\rm ^4he } - n_{(^4{\\rm he}x^- ) } ) n_{(px^- ) } , \\\\",

    "the masses of the bound states are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the thermally - averaged recombination cross sections @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the @xmath6he and @xmath34 bound - states formation are given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cosmic temperature , and @xmath37 is the fine structure constant .    the terms in the third lines of the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bolzhe4 ] ) and ( [ eq : bolzp ] ) represent a charge - exchange reaction , @xmath38 with its thermally - averaged cross section being denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "this process is effective just after @xmath40 has been formed .",
    "recently it has been reported that a rate of this charge - exchange reaction is more rapid than the hubble expansion rate  @xcite at the formation epoch of @xmath40 which is approximately given by @xmath41 where we took the yield variable of free @xmath19he to be @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the produced @xmath40 is immediately destroyed , and rather @xmath5 is included into @xmath43 after the destruction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction1 ] , we plot the time evolution of @xmath44 with @xmath45he ( left ) and @xmath46 ( right ) , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the initial values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . here",
    "the initial value of @xmath49 means the one after @xmath51 s standard bbn processes have finished and well before its bound - state formation starts .",
    "@xmath52 is the initial value of @xmath53 well before @xmath5 decays , and/or its bound - state is formed .",
    "the dashed lines denote solutions of saha s equation and @xmath51 and assumes only one component of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , there should be deviations from this solution when we consider two components of @xmath54  and  @xmath19he ) .",
    "however because the dashed lines still give us useful information to understand behaviors of the numerical solutions , we also plot them in figs .",
    "[ fig : fraction1 ] and [ fig : fraction2 ] ] , @xmath55 from the figure , we can see that the bound states form at around @xmath56 10 kev and 1 kev for @xmath43 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the time - evolution of the @xmath43 formation excellently agrees with the solution of the saha s equation . on the other hand ,",
    "deviations from the saha s equation can be seen in case of @xmath40 . the behavior of the time - evolution of @xmath40 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction1 ] ( right ) can be easily understood as follows .",
    "if @xmath57 , sufficient amounts of free @xmath5 exist , independently of the detail of @xmath58 formation , and the abundance of @xmath40 approximately follows the solution of saha s equation . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath59 , the abundance of @xmath40 should deviate from saha s equation .",
    "furthermore , the charge - exchange reaction becomes important when @xmath60 .",
    "then the formation of @xmath27 is balanced between the production and the destruction processes , and the abundance becomes approximately the order of @xmath61 .",
    "thus the production of @xmath40 stops at around @xmath62 kev for @xmath63 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction1 ] ( right ) .",
    "this feature is consistent with fig .  2.7 in ref .",
    "@xcite and what was stated in ref .",
    "the reason why @xmath9s are included mainly into @xmath6he is that the number density of @xmath9 is much smaller than that of electron , wihch is completely different from the case of the standard recombination of electron .    on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction2 ] we plot the time evolution of @xmath64 with @xmath45he ( left ) and @xmath46 ( right ) .",
    "similarly to fig.[fig : fraction1 ] the dashed lines show the result of saha s equation . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fraction2 ] we see that most of @xmath5 are captured into the bound state with @xmath19he if @xmath52 is smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "this means that ( @xmath66 ) disappears immediately after its formation for @xmath67 .",
    "then we find that almost all @xmath5s are captured by @xmath19he , and form the bound state ( @xmath19he@xmath5 ) .",
    "because the abundances of other singly - charged nuclei such as deuterium and tritium , are much smaller than that of proton , we can omit contributions from deuterium and tritium .",
    "this result tells us that the bound states of @xmath5 can not be neutralized even after ( @xmath66 ) could have been formed .",
    "the fact that the total electric charges of the dominant non - relativistic components can not be shielded has a strong impact on the structure formation .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effect of the charged bound state on large scale structure .",
    "in fact , the discussion below also applies to charged ( massive ) particles themselves when they constitute a dominant non - relativistic component .",
    "thus in the following , we use  champs \" to indicate both the free champs and the bound states of champs with light elements which have a net electric charge .",
    "when there exist long - lived champs , they couple with photon - baryon fluid , thus matter density fluctuations oscillate under the scales which enters the horizon before champs decay .",
    "thus fluctuations of matter can not grow , then the matter power spectrum is suppressed on corresponding scales , which is called  acoustic damping \" in literature .",
    "an explicit calculation has been done on how the matter power spectrum is suppressed in @xcite . to obtain the constraint on the decay rate rigorously ,",
    "we need to compare the matter power spectrum with observational data .",
    "however , when champs are dominant component of non - relativistic matter , the matter spectrum is abruptly suppressed at the damping scale .",
    "thus the evaluation of the damping scale would be enough to obtain the constraint on champs .",
    "hence in the following , we simply make an estimate of the acoustic damping scale as a function of the decay rate .",
    "the scale under which matter power spectrum is suppressed , which we denote @xmath68 in the following , can be estimated as follows . for fluctuations of the scale which enters the horizon before champs decay ( @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lifetime of champs ) , they are damped by the acoustic oscillation . on the other hand , fluctuations of the scale which enters the horizon when",
    "@xmath71 , in other words , they can be assumed to be usual neutral dark matter , fluctuations of such scales grow with time as in the standard case decay , which would be highly model - dependent . to obtain a conservative constraint",
    ", we neglect this effect here . ] .",
    "since the horizon - crossing occurs when @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the hubble parameter , the characteristic scale @xmath68 under which the matter power spectrum is suppressed is defined by @xmath74 we assume that the champs decay during radiation - dominated ( rd ) epoch .",
    "then @xmath73 is related to the cosmic time as @xmath75 . on the other hand , during rd , @xmath73 can be also written as @xmath76 putting these together , we obtain the characteristic scale @xmath68 as @xmath77 to make some rough estimate , we recall that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 for example , when @xmath81 , the corresponding damping scale is @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 , the damping scale becomes @xmath84 , which is the order of the galaxy scale .",
    "here it should be mentioned that the damping scale down to @xmath85 can be probed with future observations of qso - galaxy strong lens system @xcite .",
    "thus the constraints from large scale structure would be much more stringent and such future observations give us a lot of information on champs .",
    "now we discuss the constraint on the abundance and the decay rate of champs from some cosmological observations , paying particular attention to that from large scale structure .",
    "we show the constraint on the @xmath53 vs. @xmath70 plane , where @xmath53 is the yield variable of @xmath5 which is the number density of @xmath5 to the entropy density ratio . in the following , we assume that the energy density of champs is fixed to give the present dark matter density if they are stable .",
    "( i.e. , the energy density of champs before the decay is fixed by this requirement . )",
    "thus the yield variable and the mass are related as @xmath86    in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] , we draw the acoustic damping scales @xmath87 and @xmath88 by the vertical long - dashed lines . if we confirm structures larger than a scale , we can exclude the right region of the corresponding line . here",
    "it should be noted that unstable champs can erase the structure of small scales , and thus can solve some problems regarding the discrepancies between observations @xcite and predictions of n - body simulation in @xmath89cdm model  @xcite  [ multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "another important constraint comes from the overproduction of @xmath90li by the catalyzed bbn through @xmath91he@xmath92 + d @xmath93 @xmath90li + @xmath5 induced by the formation of @xmath91he@xmath92  @xcite .",
    "observational fraction of @xmath90li/@xmath94li gives a upper bound on @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "notice that the constraint from cbbn does not depend on the champ mass .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath53 for @xmath95  sec is @xmath96 .",
    "thus , requiring the abundance of champs gives the present dark matter density if they are stable , the constraint from large scale structure becomes more relevant than that from cbbn for @xmath97  gev .    for reference",
    ", we also show other possible constraints placed on @xmath50 and @xmath70 from the photodissociation of bbn @xcite and cmb @xmath98 and @xmath99-distortion of cmb spectrum @xcite with the mass of champs being fixed independent of the relation of eq .. since the way of fixing the mass is different from that in other constraints , these constraints should be interpreted with some care in the figure .",
    "here we assumed that @xmath5 emits electromagnetic particles and take some representative values for the energy injected from the decay of @xmath5 as @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the lines of the constraints from the photodissociation and the cmb are obtained by appropriately scaling the result of  @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition , here we have assumed that the branching ratio into electromagnetic particles @xmath102 would be the order of unity .",
    "the readers can easily obtain these bounds from photodissociation and cmb distortions by scaling the branching ratio into electromagnetic particles correspondingly .",
    "when the lifetime of champs is longer than the age of the universe , the constraint from the sea water may apply @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] , we fixed the energy density of champs to become the same as the present dm density .",
    "thus the constraint from the sea water is @xmath103 , which corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "as mentioned above , the constraint from large scale structure does not depends on the mass and the yield variable . from the figure , we can see that large scale structure can give the stringent constraint in some parameter regions .",
    "so far we have discussed the case that the dominant component of the nonrelativistic particles in the universe could only be the negative champs .",
    "it would be trivial that long - lived positively - charged particles with @xmath105s can be simply excluded by the same reason from the viewpoint of the large - scale structure without taking into account neither the bound - state formation nor their neutralization if they become the dominant component .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the evolution of the bound state of champs with light elements and have shown that the negatively - charged massive particle can not be neutralized even after its bound - state formation with protons at around 0.5 kev .",
    "this is because the charge - exchange reaction by free @xmath19he through ( @xmath66 ) + @xmath19he @xmath93 ( @xmath19he@xmath5 ) + @xmath34 is much more rapid than the cosmic - expansion rate , and almost all @xmath5 will be included into ( @xmath19he@xmath5 ) for @xmath106 , which is positively - charged .",
    "this gives a high impact on the formation of the large - scale structure if those charged particles are dominant non - relativistic components of the universe like cold dark matter at the cosmic time @xmath107 .",
    "then any galaxies can not be formed by the suppression of the density perturbation through the acoustic oscillations .",
    "this simply means that the lifetime of the negative champs should be @xmath108 s at longest .",
    "as was discussed in the text , future observations of qso - galaxy strong lens system can probe the structure down to @xmath109 .",
    "those future observations will reveal the nature of the long - lived champs . in this letter",
    ", we have presented the result for the case where the abundance of champs is fixed to be the present - day dark matter density if they are stable",
    ". however , it would be interesting to investigate the case of the energy density of champs being changed , which will be the issue of a separate paper .",
