    "traditionally security in wireless networks has been mainly focused on higher layers using cryptographic methods @xcite . pioneered by aaron wyner s work @xcite , which introduced the wiretap channel and established fundamental results of creating perfectly secure communications without relying on private keys ,",
    "physical - layer - based security has drawn increasing attention recently .",
    "the basic idea of physical layer security is to exploit the physical characteristics of the wireless channel to provide secure communications . the security is quantified by the _ secrecy capacity _ , which is defined as the maximum rate of reliable information sent from the source to the intended destination in the presence of eavesdroppers .",
    "wyner showed that when the eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the main channel , the source and the destination can exchange secure messages at a non - zero rate .",
    "the following research work @xcite studied the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wiretap channel , and @xcite extended wyner s approach to the transmission of confidential messages over the broadcast channels . very recently",
    ", physical layer security have been generalized to investigate wireless fading channels @xcite@xcite , and various multiple access scenarios @xcite@xcite .",
    "note the fact that if the source - wiretapper channel is stronger than the source - destination channel , the perfect secrecy rate will be zero @xcite .",
    "some work @xcite@xcite has been proposed to overcome this limitation with the help of relay cooperation by _ cooperative relaying _",
    "@xcite@xcite , and _ cooperative jamming _",
    "for instance , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors proposed effective decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) based cooperative relaying protocols for physical layer security , respectively .",
    "cooperative jamming is another approach to improve the secrecy rate by interfering the eavesdropper with codewords independent of the source messages . in yener and tekin s work",
    "@xcite , a scheme termed _ collaborative secrecy _ was proposed , in which a non - transmitting user was selected to help increase the secrecy capacity for a transmitting user by effectively `` jamming '' the eavesdropper .",
    "following similar idea as @xcite , they first proposed cooperative jamming in @xcite and @xcite in order to increase achievable rates in the scenarios where general gaussian multiple access wire - tap channel and two - way wire - tap channel were assumed , respectively .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite investigated the effects of user cooperation on the secrecy of broadcast channels by considering a cooperative relay broadcast channel , and showed that user cooperation can increase the achievable secrecy region .",
    "the study of communicating through unauthenticated intermediate relays between a source - destination pair started from yenner and he s work @xcite@xcite .",
    "the relay channel with confidential messages was also investigated in @xcite@xcite , where the untrusted relay node acts both as an eavesdropper and a conventional assistant relay .",
    "two - way communication is a common scenario in which two nodes transmit information to each other simultaneously .",
    "recently , the two - way relay channel @xcite@xcite has attracted lots of interest from both academic and industrial communities due to its bandwidth efficiency and potential application to cellular networks and peer - to - peer networks . in @xcite and @xcite , both af and df protocols for one - way relay channels were extended to general full - duplex discrete two - way relay channel and half - duplex gaussian two - way relay channel , respectively . in @xcite ,",
    "network and channel coding were used in two - way relay channel to increase the sum - rate of two sources .",
    "the work in @xcite introduced a two - way memoryless system with relays in which the signal transmitted by the relay was obtained by applying an instantaneous relay function to the previously received signal in order to optimize the symbol error rate performance .",
    "as for the secure communications , in @xcite , yener and he investigated the role of feedback in secrecy for two - way networks , and proved that the loss in secrecy rate when ignoring the feedback is very limited in a scenario with half - duplex gaussian two - way relay channels and an eavesdropper . it is well known that , in a cooperative communication network , proper relay / jammer selection can have a significant impact on the performance of the whole system .",
    "several relay selection techniques @xcite@xcite have been explored by far .",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed a non - jamming relay selection scheme for two - way networks with multiple af relays in an environment without eavesdroppers , which maximized the worse received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the two end users . in @xcite ,",
    "several relay selection techniques were proposed in one - way cooperative networks with secrecy constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated some relay selection techniques in a two - hop df cooperative communication system with no central processing unit to optimally select the relay .",
    "although cooperative networks have received much attention by far , the physical layer security issues with secrecy constraints in two - way schemes have not yet been well investigated .    to this end , in this paper , we propose a scheme that can implement information exchange in the physical layer against eavesdroppers for two - way cooperative networks , consisting of two sources , a number of intermediate nodes , and one eavesdropper , with the constraints for physical layer security . unlike @xcite ,",
    "in which the relay selection is operated in an environment with no security requirement , our work takes into account the secrecy constraints .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where many relay selections based on the df strategy for one - way cooperative wireless networks were proposed and a safe broadcast phase was assumed , the problem we consider here involves a non - security broadcast phase , and the information is transferred bidirectionally .",
    "specifically , a node is selected from an intermediate node set to operate at a conventional relay mode , and then uses an af strategy in order to assist the sources to deliver data to the corresponding destination .",
    "meanwhile , another two intermediate nodes that perform as jammers are selected to transmit artificial interference in order to degrade the eavesdropper links in the first and second phases of signal transmissions , respectively .",
    "we assume that both destinations can not mitigate artificial interference , and thus , the jamming will also degrade the desired information channels .",
    "the principal question here is how to select the relay and the jamming nodes in order to increase information security , and meanwhile protect the source message against eavesdroppers .",
    "several selection algorithms are proposed , aiming at promoting the assistance to the sources as well as the interference to the eavesdropper .",
    "the theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the proposed jamming schemes can improve the secrecy rate of the system by a large scale , but only within a certain transmitted power range . in some particular scenarios ,",
    "the proposed schemes become less efficient than the conventional ones .",
    "we then propose a hybrid scheme with an intelligent switching mechanism between jamming and non - jamming modes to solve this problem .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section slowromancap2@",
    ", we describe the system model , and formulate the problem under consideration .",
    "section slowromancap3@ presents the proposed selection techniques , and introduces their hybrid implementations . in section slowromancap4@ , we provide both quantitative analysis and qualitative discussions of different selection schemes in some typical configurations .",
    "numerical results are shown in section slowromancap5@ , and in section slowromancap6@ , we draw the main conclusions .",
    "we assume a network configuration consisting of two sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one eavesdropper @xmath2 , and an intermediate node set @xmath3 with @xmath4 nodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] it schematically shows the system model .",
    "as the intermediate nodes can not transmit and receive simultaneously ( half duplex constraint ) , the communication process is performed into two phases . during the broadcasting phase , @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 transmit their data to the intermediate nodes .",
    "in addition , according to the security protocol , one node @xmath5 is selected from @xmath6 to operate as a `` jammer '' and transmit intentional interference to degrade the eavesdropper links in this phase . since the jamming signal is unknown at the rest nodes of @xmath6 , the interference will also degrade the performance of the relay links , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] . in the second phase",
    ", according to the security protocol , an intermediate node @xmath7 is selected to operate as a conventional relay and forwards the source messages to the corresponding destinations .",
    "a second jammer @xmath8 is selected from @xmath6 , for the same reason as that for @xmath5 .",
    "note that the destinations @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not able to mitigate the artificial interference from the jamming node , either .     and @xmath1.,width=460 ]    in both two phases ,",
    "a slow , flat , and block rayleigh fading environment is assumed , i.e. , the channel remains static for one coherence interval and changes independently in different coherence intervals with a variance @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the euclidean distance between node @xmath11 and node @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represents the path - loss exponent .",
    "the channel between node @xmath11 and node @xmath12 is denoted as @xmath14 , which is modeled as a zero - mean , independent , circularly - symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath15 . furthermore , additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero mean and unit variance is assumed .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the transmitted power for the source nodes , the relay node and the jamming nodes , respectively . in order to protect the destinations from severe artificial interference ,",
    "the jamming nodes transmit with a lower power than the relay nodes @xcite , and thus their transmitted power can be defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the power ratio of the relay to the jammer .    in the first phase , the two sources send information symbols @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , which are mapped to a psk set .",
    "the intermediate node @xmath7 and eavesdropper @xmath2 thus receive @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the noise at @xmath7 and @xmath2 , respectively .    in the second phase ,",
    "the node @xmath7 is selected to amplify its received signal and forward it to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath7 broadcasts @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "since the destination @xmath28 knows @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 ) , it can cancel the self - interference .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the eavesdropper @xmath2 get @xmath31 where @xmath32,@xmath33 , and @xmath34 represent the noise terms at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath35 , defined as the overall signal to interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of the channel @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , can be calculated as @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the link @xmath41 : @xmath42    strictly speaking , in order to maximize the overall sinr of the eavesdropping links , the eavesdropper ( @xmath2 ) can perform whatever operations as it wishes with the signals received in the previous two phases . here in this paper , we take a simple case in which the eavesdropper applies maximal ratio combining ( mrc )  @xcite , so as to examine the efficiency of the proposed jamming schemes . according to mrc , @xmath2 combines the received signals by multiplying @xmath43 in ( [ e1 ] ) and @xmath44 in ( [ e2 ] ) with proper weighting factors @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . without loss of generality , consider the scenario in which @xmath2 intends to optimize the sinr of eavesdropper link @xmath47 , for @xmath48 , the combined eavesdropping signal can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the conjugate transpose . @xmath53 and",

    "thus , the sinr of link @xmath61 can be calculated as @xmath62    in an environment where the instantaneous channel knowledge set @xmath59 is not available , we can use the expectation of snrs for the eavesdropper links @xmath63 $ ] , which is provided by the average channel knowledge @xmath64 , to get the sinrs :    @xmath65}}{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { s_j , e } } } \\right ] + \\mathbb{e } \\left [ { { \\gamma_{j_1,e } } } \\right ] + 1 } } + \\frac{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { s_j , r , e } } } \\right]}}{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { s_j , r , e } } } \\right ] + \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { j_1,r , e } } } \\right ] + \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { j_2,e } } } \\right ] + \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { { \\gamma _ { r , e } } } \\right ] + 1 } } , \\nonumber \\\\ & \\mbox{s.t.}~\\psi_1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 $ ] stands for the expectation operator .      the instantaneous secrecy rate for the node set @xmath6 for source @xmath28 can be expressed @xcite @xmath67^ + , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70^ + \\buildrel \\delta \\over = \\max \\left\\ { { 0,x } \\right\\}$ ] .",

    "note that here the selected jammers @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the two phases may be the same node , which is determined by the instantaneous secrecy rate .      in a conventional cooperative network",
    ", the relay scheme does not have the help from jamming nodes .",
    "we derive the following solutions under this scenario .",
    "the conventional selection does not take the eavesdropper channels into account , and the relay node is selected according to the instantaneous snr of the links between node @xmath0 and node @xmath1 only .",
    "therefore , the sinr given in ( [ gamma_j ] ) becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the sinr of the channel @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) without considering the eavesdropper .",
    "hence , the conventional selection algorithm can be expressed as @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 given by ( [ gamma_sisj ] ) and ( [ gamma_rsj ] ) , respectively . since ( [ cs ] ) shows that this selection does not consider the eavesdropping links , the cs algorithm may not able to support systems with the secrecy constraints even though it may effective in non - eavesdropper environments .",
    "this solution takes the eavesdropper into account and selects the relay node based on @xmath57 , which provides the instantaneous channel knowledge for all the links .",
    "then , the sinr of link @xmath47 in ( [ gamma_ei ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath86    the optimal selection is given as : @xmath87 where @xmath88      the suboptimal selection implements the relay selection based on the knowledge set @xmath58 , which gives the average estimate of the eavesdropper links .",
    "therefore , it avoids the difficulty of getting instantaneous estimate of the channel feedbacks .",
    "similar to the os algorithm in ( [ os ] ) , the suboptimal selection can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90}}{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\gamma _ { s_j , e } } \\right]+1 } } + \\frac{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\gamma _ { s_i , r , e } } \\right]}}{{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\gamma _ { s_j , r , e } } \\right ] + \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\gamma _ { r , e } } \\right]+1}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in comparison of the os in ( [ os ] ) , the only difference of the ss algorithm in ( [ ss ] ) is that it requires the average channel state information , @xmath58 , which would be more useful in practice .",
    "in this section , we present several node selection techniques based on the optimization problem given by ( [ selecriterion ] ) in the two - way systems . unlike @xcite , where the selection techniques only concern about the secrecy performance in the second phase of transmission , here , our work takes into account both the two phases in order to select a set of relay and jammers that can maximize the overall expectation of secrecy rate .",
    "the optimal selection with maximum sum instantaneous secrecy rate assumes a knowledge set @xmath59 and ensures a maximization of the sum of instantaneous secrecy rates of node @xmath0 and node @xmath1 given in ( [ cs ] ) , which gives credit to @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei ] ) , respectively .",
    "the approach in ( [ os - msisr_selection ] ) reflects the basic idea of using both cooperative relaying and cooperative jamming in order to promote the system s secrecy performance .",
    "specifically , the os - msisr scheme here tends to select a set of relay and jammers that maximizes @xmath92 , which means promoting the assistance to the sources .",
    "meanwhile this relay and jammer set tends to minimize @xmath93 , which is equivalent to enhance the interference to the eavesdropper .",
    "although the os - msisr scheme seems to be a straightforward application for cooperative relaying and cooperative jamming , the actual selection procedure usually involves trade - offs .",
    "for instance , according to ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ gamma_j1sj ] ) , we should select the relay and jammer set that minimizes @xmath94 in order to make @xmath92 as high as possible . considering ( [ gamma_sjre ] ) , ( [ gamma_j1re ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei ] ) , however , the lower @xmath94 is , the higher @xmath93 is , which is undesirable .",
    "thus , we have to make a trade - off between raising @xmath92 and inhibiting @xmath93 in order to optimize the right part of ( [ os - msisr_selection ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the os - msisr in ( [ os - msisr_selection ] ) is complicated , in this subsection we propose a reduced - complexity algorithm .",
    "it is common that the sum secrecy rate of two sources , i.e. @xmath95 , may be driven down to a low level by the user with the lower secrecy rate . as a result , for low complexity",
    ", the intermediate nodes , which maximize the minimum secrecy rate of two users , can be selected to achieve the near - optimal performance .",
    "in addition , in some scenarios , the considered secrecy performance does not only take into account the total secrecy rate of all the source nodes , but also the individual secrecy rate of each node .",
    "if one source node has low secrecy rate , the whole system is regarded as secrecy inefficient . furthermore , assuring each individual source node a high secrecy rate is another perspective of increasing the whole system s secrecy performance .",
    "the os - mmisr selection maximizes the worse instantaneous secrecy rate of the two source nodes with the assumption of knowledge set @xmath59 , and we can get @xmath96 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei ] ) , respectively .      the original idea of using jamming nodes is to introduce interference on the eavesdropper links",
    ". however , there are two side - effects of using jamming .",
    "firstly , the jamming node in the second phase @xmath8 poses undesired interference directly onto the destinations .",
    "secondly , it degrades the links between the relay node @xmath7 and the destinations .",
    "given the assumption that the destinations can not mitigate this artificial interference , continuous jamming in both phases is not always beneficial for the whole system . in some specific situation ( e.g. , @xmath8 is close to one destination ) , the continuous jamming may decrease secrecy rate seriously , and act as a bottleneck for the system . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", we introduce the idea of intelligent switching between the os - msisr and the os scheme in order to reduce the impact of `` negative interference '' .",
    "the threshold for the involvement of the jammer nodes is @xmath97 where @xmath98^ + .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , ( [ osw_criterion ] ) can be further written as @xmath99 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei ] ) , ( [ gamma_os_i ] ) and ( [ gamma_os_ei ] ) , respectively .    for each time slot , if ( [ osw_criterion_approx ] ) is met , the os - msisr scheme provides higher instantaneous secrecy rate than os does and is preferred .",
    "otherwise the os scheme is more efficient in promoting the system s secrecy performance , which should be employed . because of the uncertainty of the channel coefficient @xmath14 for each channel @xmath102",
    ", the osw should outperform either the continuous jamming scheme or the non - jamming one .      with the assumption of @xmath59",
    ", we can get some optimal selection metrics . however , its practical interest and potential implements are only limited to some special ( e.g. military ) applications , where the instantaneous quality of the eavesdropper links can be measured by some specific protocols . in practice , only an average knowledge of these links @xmath64 would be available from long term eavesdropper supervision .",
    "the selection metrics is modified as    @xmath103    where @xmath92 and @xmath104 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ a_gamma_ei ] ) , respectively .    from ( [ ss - msisr_selection ] )",
    ", we can predict that for a scenario in which the intermediate nodes are sparsely distributed across the considered area , the ss - msisr scheme can provide similar relay and jammer selection with the os - msisr scheme .",
    "this is because a slightly difference between @xmath105 $ ] provided by @xmath64 and @xmath106 provided by @xmath59 would not be enough for the scheme to select another far - away intermediate node .",
    "thus , under this condition , the average eavesdropper channel knowledge set @xmath64 may contain sufficient channel information as well for a quasi - optimal selection .",
    "this scheme refers to the practical application of the above selection with maximum worse instantaneous secrecy rate in ( [ os - mmisr_selection ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of considering @xmath64 as the average behavior of eavesdropper links is the same as ss - msisr , but aimed at looking for the maximum worse instantaneous secrecy rate , which is written as @xmath107 where @xmath92 and @xmath104 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ a_gamma_ei ] ) , respectively .",
    "given the fact that jamming is not always a positive process for the performance of the system , the suboptimal switching refers to the practical application of the intelligent switching between the ss - msisr and the ss schemes .",
    "the basic idea is the same as osw , but the switching criterion uses the available knowledge set @xmath64 .",
    "more specifically , the required condition for switching from ss - msisr to ss mode is @xmath108 where @xmath92 , @xmath104 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given by ( [ gamma_j ] ) and ( [ a_gamma_ei ] ) , ( [ gamma_i_ss ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei_ss ] ) , respectively .",
    "the previous selection techniques are proposed based on the assumption that the jamming signal is unknown at both the two destinations .",
    "this assumption avoids the initialization period in which the jamming sequence is defined , and thus , it reduces the risk of giving out the artificial interference to the eavesdropper . for comparison reasons , here we propose a `` control '' scheme , in which the jamming signal can be decoded at the destinations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but not at the eavesdropper @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", the sinr of the link from @xmath28 ( for @xmath30 ) to @xmath2 remains the same as @xmath93 given by ( [ gamma_ei ] ) .",
    "the sinr of the link from @xmath28 to @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) is modified as follows : @xmath113    the oskj scheme is taken into consideration in the numerical results section as a reference .",
    "this , however , is not the `` ideal '' jamming scheme since the artificial interference from the jammers only degrades the eavesdropper links . as we have discovered and will discuss in section slowromancap5@ , in some particular scenarios , the oskj scheme is outperformed by the osw and ssw schemes presented above , for the jamming has changed the value of @xmath114 given in  ( [ t ] ) .",
    "in this section , we firstly do some quantitative analysis on the asymptotic performance of both the proposed jamming and non - jamming schemes in high transmitted power range .",
    "then , we provide a qualitative discussion of the secrecy performance of different selection schemes in some typical scenarios based on the system model in section  slowromancap2@.      without loss of generality , we take the os scheme for example . with high transmitted power @xmath16 , we can get @xmath115    we can see that @xmath116 grows rapidly as @xmath16 increases , while @xmath117 converges to a value that depends only on the relative distances between the sources , the eavesdropper and the relay . therefore , the ergodic secrecy capacity @xmath118 $ ] also increases rapidly with the transmitted power @xmath16 . based on ( [ gamma_i_os_approx ] ) and ( [ gamma_ei_os_approx ] ) , the slope of the curve of @xmath119 $ ] versus @xmath16 ( measured by db ) can be approximately calculated as @xmath120}}{{\\partial p_s } } \\nonumber\\\\   = & ~ \\frac{{\\partial \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\frac{1}{2}\\log _ 2 \\frac{{10^{p_s /10 } |h_{s1,r } |^2   \\cdot 10^{p_s /10 } |h_{s2,r } |^2 } } { { \\gamma_{e1}^{os }   \\cdot \\gamma^{os}_{e2 } } } } \\right]}}{{\\partial p_s } } \\nonumber\\\\    = & ~ \\frac{{\\partial \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\frac{1}{2}\\log _ 2 10^{2p_s /10 } } \\right]}}{{\\partial p_s } } + \\frac{{\\partial \\mathbb{e}\\left [ { \\frac{1}{2}\\log _ 2 \\frac{{|h_{s1,r } |^2 |h_{s2,r } |^2 } } { { \\gamma^{os}_{e1 }   \\cdot \\gamma^{os}_{e2 } } } } \\right]}}{{\\partial p_s } } \\nonumber\\\\    = & ~ \\frac{{\\partial \\left ( { \\frac{{p_s } } { { 10}}\\log _ 2 10 } \\right)}}{{\\partial p_s } } \\nonumber\\\\    = & ~ \\frac{1}{{10}}\\log _ 2 10 \\nonumber\\\\    \\approx&~ 0.3322   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the other non - jamming schemes ( i.e. cs , ss ) , we note that they share the same asymptotic performance as the os scheme with a linear increment of slope about 0.3322 as the transmitted power @xmath16 increases .",
    "we use the same method as in the previous analysis for the non - jamming selections to analyze the asymptotic performance of the proposed jamming schemes . as the transmitted power @xmath16 increases to a relatively high value",
    ", it yields @xmath121 @xmath122    it is clear that both @xmath92 and @xmath93 are independent of @xmath16 , which means that for high @xmath16 , the ergodic secrecy rate @xmath123 $ ] stops increasing and converges to a fixed value .",
    "consider the asymptotic performance of the os scheme that grows linearly with the increment of @xmath16 as described by ( [ slope_approx ] ) , it is safe to predict that there will be a crossover point , @xmath124 , between the ergodic secrecy rate v.s . transmitted power curve with jamming and the one with non - jamming . in a power range below @xmath124",
    ", the jamming scheme outperforms the non - jamming one , while above this point , the jamming scheme loses its advantage in providing higher ergodic secrecy capacity .",
    "we note that the analysis above can apply to any scheme with continuous jamming ( i.e. , os - msisr , os - mmisr , ss - msisr , and ss - mmisr ) , which indicates that they share the same asymptotic behavior as the @xmath16 increases . in another word , the proposed selection techniques ( except for osw and ssw )",
    "behave better than the non - jamming schemes only within a certain transmitted power range .",
    "fortunately , in a practical case , @xmath16 is always limited in a relatively low range and will not increase infinitely .",
    "this is a common configuration in which the the eavesdropper @xmath2 has similar distance with two sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the intermediate nodes spread randomly within the considered area . with a relatively far distance in between ,",
    "the interference link between @xmath5 and @xmath7 becomes weak .",
    "as predicted in the previous subsection , within a certain transmitted power range ( less than the crossover point @xmath124 ) , the selection approaches with continuous jamming are able to provide a higher ergodic secrecy rate than the non - jamming schemes .",
    "this gain proves the introduction of jamming in selection schemes as an effective technique . outside this range ,",
    "the secrecy rates of the conventional non - jamming schemes continue to grow with a slope of 0.3322 as verified by ( [ slope_approx ] ) , whereas those of the continuous jamming schemes converge to a fixed value . inside this scope ,",
    "the jamming schemes lose their efficiency in providing a better secrecy performance for the system .",
    "we note that in some particular scenarios , the system s integrated secrecy performance is not measured by the sum of the total secrecy rates , but by the minimum secrecy capacity of all the source nodes in the system . in this situation , os - mmisr and ss - mmisr can optimize the overall secrecy performance of the whole system . for the hybrid schemes , the osw and ssw schemes are able to provide better secrecy performance in the whole transmitted power scope , since it overcomes the bottleneck caused by negative interference on the relay - destination links .      under the condition that all the intermediate nodes are located very close to each other , we note that the continuous jamming selections will lose its efficiency in meeting the secrecy constraints .",
    "specifically , we will discuss two extreme situations in which the intermediate nodes cluster is near to one of the destination nodes @xmath28 , and to the eavesdropper @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "there are two reasons that make the proposed jamming schemes inefficient .",
    "firstly , the nodes of the relay / jammer cluster gather too close to each other , such that the selected jammer in the first phase @xmath5 has too much negative impact on the selected relay @xmath7 , which further decreases the sinrs in the second phase .",
    "secondly , the jamming code from @xmath8 in the second phase also has an overly - strong interference on the destination to the one it stays close with .      aside from the first reason presented above , in this configuration , the direct link between the relay @xmath7 and the eavesdropper @xmath2 gets too strong , which will seriously sabotage the secrecy performance of selection with continuous jamming",
    ".    on the other hand , the hybrid protocols ( osw and ssw ) will still be the most effective schemes in this configuration , since the system s secrecy performance considered here is measured by the ergodic secrecy rate .",
    "this is the situation in which the eavesdropper @xmath2 can get the communicating information most easily , since the direct link between @xmath2 and any one of the source nodes is strong , which makes the introduction of jamming very necessary .",
    "the jamming schemes should be efficient within quite a large power range , and the hybrid schemes should still perform as the best selection techniques within the whole power scope .",
    "simulation environment with @xmath125 , @xmath126.,width=460 ]    in this section , we will provide computer simulations in order to validate the analysis in the previous section .",
    "the simulation environment takes into account two sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one eavesdropper @xmath2 , and a intermediate node cluster consisting of @xmath125 nodes .",
    "all the nodes are located in a 2d square topology within a @xmath127 unit square . for simplicity ,",
    "the source nodes and the relay transmit with the same power , i.e. @xmath128 . the relay and jammer nodes transmit with a relay - jammer power ratio @xmath129 .",
    "as assumed in section slowromancap2@ , the power of the awgn is @xmath130 .",
    "the path - loss exponent is set to @xmath126 . in this paper ,",
    "the adopted performance metric is the ergodic secrecy rate .",
    "meanwhile some results are also provided in terms of secrecy outage probability @xmath131 $ ] , where @xmath132 $ ] denotes probability , and @xmath133 is the target secrecy rate .    in the first simulation , we assume a scenario where @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are located at @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "the intermediate nodes spread randomly within the square space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .     for different selection techniques.,width=460 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] shows the ergodic secrecy rate versus the transmitted power @xmath128 of different selection schemes .",
    "we can observe that selection algorithms with jamming outperform their non - jamming counterparts within a certain transmitted power range ( less than @xmath137 ) , where the ergodic secrecy rate of the os - msisr scheme is approximately higher than that of the os scheme by 1 bit per channel use ( bpcu ) . outside this range ( @xmath138 ) ,",
    "the secrecy rate of os - msisr converges to a power - independent value which is approximately 4.1 bpcu , whereas the ergodic secrecy rate of os continues to grow with a slope of 0.3322 , as proved by ( [ slope_approx ] ) .",
    "this validates the secrecy performance analysis in section slowromancap4@. in addition , we can see that in this relay topology , the suboptimal schemes ( ss - msisr , ss - mmisr ) which are based on average channel knowledge perform almost the same as the optimal schemes ( os - msisr , os - mmisr ) , which implies that in this configuration where the intermediate nodes are sparsely distributed , an average channel knowledge may also provide enough information in order to get optimal relay selection .     for different selection techniques with @xmath139 bpcu.,width=460 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , a comparison between the os - msisr and os - mmisr shows that the os - msisr scheme has slightly higher ergodic secrecy capacity by about 0.25 bpcu than os - mmisr does corresponding to transmitted power @xmath16 .",
    "the same comparison result can be observed from the ss - msisr and ss - mmisr schemes , which matches our previous analysis .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that osw performs better than any other selection techniques with or without continuous jamming . at a low power range",
    "where @xmath140 , the osw scheme performs slightly better than os - msisr , but much better than os ( by about 1.2 bpcu ) , for the reason that in this range continuous jamming is almost always needed .",
    "after @xmath16 grows much higher than @xmath124 , osw outperforms both the other two schemes by a large scale . for the suboptimal case",
    ", we can see that ssw provides almost the same performance as the osw scheme in this relay topology , which validates the practical value of this hybrid scheme .",
    "an observation of the performance of oskj scheme shows that it outperforms all the other selection techniques , providing the highest ergodic secrecy rate when the transmitted power increases due to its ability of the destinations to decode the artificial interference in this oskj scheme .",
    ".,width=460 ]    within this configuration , we also compare the performance of different selection techniques measured by secrecy outage probability , which is shown in fig .  [ fig_4 ] . the target secrecy rate @xmath141 is set as 0.2 bpcu .",
    "it can be seen that selection schemes with jamming provies lower secrecy outage probability within a certain transmitted power range ( @xmath140 , @xmath142 ) . outside this range ,",
    "the conventional selection without jamming achieves better secrecy outage probability .",
    "regarding the hybrid protocols , the osw scheme outperforms the non - switching selection techniques .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] , it deals with a configuration where the intermediate nodes cluster , which also includes @xmath125 nodes , is located closely near to one of the two users ( e.g. , node @xmath0 , without loss of generality ) .",
    "we can see the ergodic secrecy rate of the proposed selection schemes in this topology differs greatly from that in the previous configuration .",
    "we observe that continuous jamming schemes ( i.e. os - msisr , os - mmisr , ss - msisr , and ss - mmisr ) are inefficient here , which converge to less than 0.5 bpcu , validating our discussion in section slowromancap4@.    .,width=460 ]    on the other hand , osw and ssw still outperform all the other selection techniques by a quite large scale ( more than 4 bpcu when @xmath16 is very high , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] .",
    "we also note that in this topology , the osw and ssw schemes perform even better than the oskj scheme , which seems to be an interesting result .",
    "further investigation reveals that the involvement of @xmath5 node in oskj causes a different value of @xmath114 with that of osw and ssw , which results in lower secrecy rates in oskj than in osw and ssw schemes .",
    "this indicates that the proposed osw / ssw schemes may perform even better than the `` ideal '' case where the destinations can mitigate the artificial interference .",
    "all of these validate the value of the selection techniques with intelligent switching in potential practical use .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , we set the intermediate nodes cluster closely to the eavesdropper @xmath2 . here",
    "the jamming schemes also perform worse than non - jamming ones in most of the transmitted power range .",
    "it also shows the range where continuous jamming schemes perform better than non - jamming schemes in this topology is slightly larger than that of the previous one , since there is no strong @xmath143 link here .",
    "regarding to the hybrid schemes , osw and ssw still perform as the best selection techniques in providing the highest secrecy rate .",
    "is close to @xmath0.,width=460 ]    finally , we place the eavesdropper @xmath2 near to one of the two sources ( taken @xmath0 for example ) to examine the results .",
    "the location of eavesdropper @xmath2 is set to @xmath144 , the intermediate nodes are spread randomly across the considered rectangle area , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] .",
    "we get a similar simulation result with that of the first configuration , in which the eavesdropper @xmath2 has the same distance with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the non - jamming schemes ( cs , os and ss ) here are less effective in promoting the secrecy performance . on the contrary ,",
    "the selection techniques with continuous jamming ( os - msisr , os - mmisr , ss - msisr and ss - mmisr ) provide much higher secrecy capacity in a large transmitted power range ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "within this power range , the hybrid schemes ( osw and ssw ) perform slightly better than the continuous jamming techniques because jamming is almost always needed in this configuration . outside this regime , where the non - jamming scheme performs better , the difference between the intelligent switching and continuous jamming increases and the hybrid schemes still perform as the most efficient schemes .",
    "this paper has studied the joint relay and jammer selection in two - way cooperative networks with physical layer secrecy consideration .",
    "the proposed scheme achieves an opportunistic selection of one conventional relay node and one ( or two ) jamming nodes to increase security against eavesdroppers based on both instantaneous and average knowledge of the eavesdropper channels .",
    "the selected relay node helps enhance the information transmission between the two sources via an af strategy , while the jamming nodes are used to produce intentional interference at the eavesdropper nodes in different transmission phases .",
    "we found that the proposed jamming schemes ( i.e. os - msisr , os - mmisr , ss - msisr , and ss - mmisr ) are effective within a certain transmitted power range for scenarios with sparsely distributed intermediate nodes . meanwhile the non - jamming schemes ( cs , os , and ss ) are preferred in configurations where the intermediate nodes are confined close to each other .",
    "the osw scheme which switches intelligently between jamming and non - jamming modes is very efficient in providing the highest secrecy rate in almost the whole transmitted power regime in two - way cooperative networks , but it requires an instantaneous eavesdropper channel knowledge . on the other hand , the suboptimal switching scheme , ssw , which is based on the average knowledge of the eavesdropper channel and therefore much practical , provides a comparable secrecy performance with the osw scheme .",
