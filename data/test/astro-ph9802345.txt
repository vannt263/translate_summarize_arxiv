    "it has been recognized shortly after the discovery of pulsars that neutron stars have velocities much in excess of those of any other normal stellar populations in our galaxy ( gunn & ostriker 1970 ; minkowski 1970 ) .",
    "however , it is only in the last few years that a significant body of evidence has come into place to support the view that type ii supernovae are nonspherical and neutron stars receive large kick velocities at birth .",
    "lyne and lorimer ( 1994 ) analyzed pulsar velocities in light of new proper - motion measurements ( harrison et al .",
    "1993 ) and up - to - date pulsar distance scale ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) , and concluded that pulsars were born with a mean speed of @xmath9  km  s@xmath7 , much larger than previously thought .",
    "more recent studies of pulsar velocities have adopted more sophisticated satistical methods and included better treatment of selection effects and uncertainties ( lorimer et al .",
    "1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1997 ) .",
    "they all yielded a result for the pulsar birth velocity in qualitative agreement ( although not in quantitative details ) with that of lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) . in particular , cordes and chernoff ( 1997 ) found that the three - dimensional space velocities of their sample of 47 pulsars have a bimodal distribution , with characteristic speeds of @xmath10  km  s@xmath7 and @xmath11  km  s@xmath7 ( corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the population ) .",
    "they also estimated that pulsars with velocities greater than @xmath14  km  s@xmath7 may be underrepresented owing to selection effects in pulsar surveys [ the uncertainty in the high - velocity end of the pulsar velocity distribution function has also be emphasized by hansen & phinney ( 1997 ) ] .",
    "concrete evidence for the existence of pulsars with velocities of @xmath15  km  s@xmath7 has come from the observation of the guitar nebula pulsar ( b2224 + 65 ) , which produces a bow shock when plowing through the interstellar medium ( cordes , romani & lundgren 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , studies of pulsar - supernova remnant associations have uncovered a number of pulsars having velocities much greater than @xmath14  km  s@xmath7 ( frail et al .  1994 ) , although in many cases the associations are not completely secure .",
    "compelling evidence for supernova asymmetry and pulsar kicks also comes from the detection of geodetic precession in the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 ( cordes et al .  1990 ; arzoumanian et al .  1996 ) , and the orbital plane precession in the psr j0045 - 7319/b star binary ( lai et al .",
    "1995 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ) and its fast orbital decay ( which indicates retrograde rotation of the b star with respect to the orbit ; see lai 1996 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that binary break - up ( as originally suggested by gott , gunn & ostriker 1970 ; see iben & tutukov 1996 ) can not be _ solely _",
    "responsible for the observed pulsar velocities , and that _",
    "natal kicks are required_. in addition , evolutionary studies of neutron star binary population imply the existence of pulsar kicks ( e.g. , deway & cordes 1987 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ; fryer et al .  1998 ;",
    "see also brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ) . finally , there are a large number of direct observations of nearby supernovae ( e.g. , cropper et al .  1988 ;",
    "trammell et al .  1993 ; mccray 1993 ; utrobin et al .  1995 ) and supernova remnants ( e.g. , morse , winkler & kirshner 1995 ; aschenbach et al .  1995 ) in radio , optical , and x - ray bands which support the notion that supernova explosions are not spherically symmetric .",
    "the origin of the pulsar velocities is still unknown .",
    "two classes of mechanisms for the _ natal kicks _ have been suggested .",
    "the first class relies on convective instabilities in the collapsed stellar core and within the rebounding shock ( e.g. , burrows & fryxell 1992 ; burrows et al .  1995 ; janka & mller 1994 ,  1996 ; herant et al .",
    "the asymmetries in the matter and temperature distributions associated with the instabilities naturally lead to asymmetric matter ejection and/or asymmetric neutrino emission .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the local , post - collapse instabilities are not adequate to account for kick velocities higher than a few hundred km  s@xmath7 ( janka & mller 1994 ) .",
    "a variant of this class of models therefore relies on the global asymmetric perturbations seeded in the presupernova cores ( goldreich et al .",
    "1996 ; see also bazan & arnett 1994 ) .",
    "clearly , the magnitude of kick velocity depends on the degree of initial asymmetry in the imploding core ( burrows & hayes 1996 ) . due to various uncertainties in the presupernova stellar models ,",
    "it is not clear at this point whether sufficiently large initial perturbations can be produced in the precollapse core ( lai & goldreich 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the second class of models in which the large pulsar kick velocities arise from asymmetric neutrino emission induced by strong magnetic fields .",
    "since @xmath16 of the neutron star binding energy ( a few times @xmath17  erg ) is released in neutrinos , tapping the neutrino energy would appear to be an efficient means to kick the newly - formed neutron star .",
    "magnetic fields are naturally invoked to break the spherical symmetry in neutrino emission .",
    "but the actual mechanism is unclear .",
    "we first briefly comment on previous works on this and related subjects .",
    "a number of authors have noted that parity violation in weak interactions may lead to asymmetric neutrino emission from proto - neutron stars ( chugai 1984 ; dorofeev et al .  1985 ; vilenkin 1995 ; horowitz & piekarewicz 1997 ) .",
    "however , their studies are largely unsatisfactory for a number of reasons : they either failed to identify the most relevant neutrino emission / interaction processes or the relevant physical conditions in proto - neutron stars , or stopped at estimating the magnetic field effects on neutrino opacities .",
    "chugai ( 1984 ) and vilenkin ( 1995 ) ( see also bezchastnov & haensel 1996 ) considered neutrino - electron scattering and concluded that the effect is extremely small ( e.g. , to obtain @xmath18  km  s@xmath7 would require a magnetic field of at least @xmath8  g ) .",
    "however , neutrino - electron scattering is less important than neutrino - nucleon scattering in determining the characteristics of neutrino transport in proto - neutron stars .",
    "similarly , dorofeev et al .",
    "( 1985 ) considered neutrino emission by urca processes in strong magnetic fields .",
    "but as shown by lai & qian ( 1998 ) , in the bulk interior of the neutron star , the asymmetry associated with neutrino emission is cancelled by the asymmetry associated with neutrino absorption . concerning the parity violation effect in proto - neutron stars ,",
    "horowitz & li ( 1997 ) recently suggested that the asymmetry in neutrino emission may be enhanced due to multiple scatterings of neutrinos by nucleons which are slightly polarized by the magnetic field .",
    "they estimated that a field strength of a few times @xmath19  g is adequate to account for kick velocities of a few hundred km  s@xmath7 .",
    "however , the paper by horowitz & li ( 1997 ) only discusses the idealized situations of scattering media , and ignores various essential physics that is needed in a proper treatment of neutrino transport in proto - neutron stars .",
    "in particular , it does not consider the effect of neutrino absorption which one might suspect to wash out the cumulative effect from multiple scatterings .",
    "our own study of the parity violation effect ( lai & qian 1998 ) was flawed in the treatment of scattering terms in the neutrino transport equation . as shown by arras & lai ( 1998 )",
    ", detailed balance requires that there be no cumulative effect from multiple scatterings in the bulk interior of the proto - neutron star where local thermodynamic equilibrium applies to a good approximation .",
    "enhancement of neutrino emission asymmetry from multiple scatterings obtains only after neutrinos thermally decouple from proto - neutron star matter , and therefore is insignificant .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1993 ) attributed pulsar kicks to asymmetric magnetic field distribution in proto - neutron stars .",
    "using the fact that neutron decay rate can be modified by the magnetic field , he inferred that neutrino emissions from opposite sides of the neutron star surface are different .",
    "however , neutron decay is not directly relevant for neutrino emission from a newly - formed neutron star .",
    "roulet ( 1997 ) ( whose paper was posted while this paper was being written ) considered the relevant neutrino absorption processes .",
    "but his study was restricted to calculating the neutrino cross sections as functions of neutrino energy ( corresponding to  2.1 of this paper ) , and therefore was insufficient for addressing the issue of asymmetric neutrino emission .    finally , it is worthwhile to mention a speculative idea on pulsar kicks which relies on nonstandard neutrino physics .",
    "kusenko & segr ( 1996 ) suggested that asymmetric @xmath20 emission could result from the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein flavor transformation between @xmath20 and @xmath0 inside a magnetized proto - neutron star because a magnetic field changes the resonance condition for the flavor transformation .",
    "with a @xmath20 mass of @xmath21  ev , they claimed that magnetic fields of @xmath22  g can give the pulsar a kick velocity of a few hundred km  s@xmath7 .",
    "however , their treatment of neutrino transport was oversimplified : e.g. , they ignored that neutrinos of different energies have different resonance surfaces . furthermore , a simple geometric effect and realistic proto - neutron star conditions easily reduce their estimated kick velocity by an order of magnitude .",
    "most likely , a magnetic field strength of @xmath23  g is needed to produce the observed average pulsar kick velocity via their mechanism ( see qian 1997 ) .",
    "similarly strong magnetic fields are required in variants of the kusenko & segr mechanism , e.g. , those considered by akhmedov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( which relies on both the neutrino mass and the neutrino magnetic moment to facilitate the flavor transformation ) .",
    "as should be clear from the brief review in  1.1 , in spite of quite a number of suggestions , there is at present no consensus on the magnitudes of the magnetic field induced asymmetry in neutrino emission from proto - neutron stars and the resulting kick velocities . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of asymmetric magnetic field topology on pulsar kicks .",
    "since the energy levels of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a magnetic field are quantized , the @xmath0 and @xmath5 absorption opacities near the neutrinosphere and the neutrino - matter decoupling region depend on the local magnetic field strength .",
    "if the _ magnitude _ of magnetic field in the north pole is different from that in the south pole ( the field does not need to be ordered ) , then asymmetric neutrino flux may be generated .",
    "here we ignore the effects of magnetic fields on the proto - neutron star structure through the equation of state  these are secondary effects as far as neutrino transport is concerned .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2 we calculate the @xmath0 and @xmath1 absorption cross sections as functions of neutrino energy in strong magnetic fields .",
    "section 3 summarizes the basic features of neutrino transport near the neutron star surface . in ",
    "4 we derive and evaluate the `` rosseland mean '' neutrino opacities which are directly related to the local neutrino flux .",
    "we then consider in  5 the change in neutrino flux due to the modified opacities , and estimate the kick velocity resulting from an asymmetric magnetic field topology . in  6 we briefly consider how the emergent neutrino spectra may be modified by the strong magnetic field . in  7 we present our conclusion .",
    "unless noted otherwise , we shall use units in which @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the boltzmann constant @xmath26 are unity .",
    "in this section we consider how magnetic fields modify the ( total ) neutrino absorption ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) cross sections for specific neutrino energies .",
    "we present our calculation of the @xmath0 absorption cross section in detail .",
    "the @xmath1 absorption cross section can be obtained in a similar manner .    to begin with , it is useful to review various energy scales involved in the problem . near the neutrinosphere and the neutrino - matter decoupling region , the matter density is typically @xmath29@xmath19 g@xmath30@xmath31 , and the temperature is about several mev .",
    "the electrons are extremely relativistic and highly degenerate , with fermi energy @xmath32mev , where @xmath33 is the electron fraction ( the number of electrons per nucleon ) and @xmath34 .",
    "the neutrons and protons have fermi energies @xmath35^{2/3}~$]mev and @xmath36mev , respectively , and thus they are essentially nondegenerate .      in strong magnetic fields the transverse motion of the electron is quantized into landau levels .",
    "the electron energy dispersion relation is e_e=^1/2 ,  n=0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  where @xmath37 is the longitudinal momentum ( along the magnetic field ) , and @xmath38 is the landau level index . the dimensionless field strength @xmath39 is defined as b ,  with  b_c = m_e^2c^3e = 4.41410 ^ 13  g. the quantization effect on the proton is extremely small due to the large proton mass , and is neglected throughout this paper .",
    "since the cyclotron radius ( characterizing the size of the landau wavefunction ) @xmath40^{1/2}= [ \\hbar/(m_e c)]b^{-1/2}=386\\,b^{-1/2}$ ] fm is much greater than the range of the weak interaction [ @xmath41 fm , where @xmath42 gev is the mass of w boson ] , one can use the @xmath43 theory with contact interaction .",
    "locally ( at the point of interaction ) the landau wavefunction resembles a plane wave .",
    "thus we expect that the spin - averaged matrix element is the same as in the case without magnetic fields .",
    "this expectation has been borne out by detailed calculations ( e.g. , fassio - canuto 1969 ; matese & oconnell 1969 ) .",
    "therefore we only need to consider the effect of magnetic field on the electron phase space .",
    "since the neutrino energy ( a few to tens of mev ) of interest is much less than the nucleon mass , we first consider the case where the nucleon mass is taken to be infinity , an approximation adopted in the standard zero - field calculations ( e.g. , tubbs & schramm 1975 ) . the cross section for @xmath44 can be written as a sum over the ( spatial and spin ) states of the electron ( per unit volume ) ^_b(e_)=a_e(1-f_e)(e_+q - e_e ) , where we have defined ag_f^2 ^2_c ( c_v^2 + 3c_a^2 ) , and the other symbols have their usual meanings : @xmath45 is the universal fermi constant , @xmath46 refers to the cabbibo angle , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the coupling constants , @xmath49 mev is the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath50 is the @xmath0 energy , and @xmath51 is the pauli blocking factor .",
    "the electron occupation number @xmath52 is f_e=1 + 1 , where @xmath53 is the electron energy , @xmath54 is the electron chemical potential , and @xmath55 is the matter temperature . for zero field ,",
    "the sum becomes @xmath56 , and we have ^_b=0(e_)=a^2(e_+q ) ^1/2(1-f_e ) , with @xmath57 . for @xmath58 , knowing that the degeneracy of the landau level ( per unit area ) is @xmath59 , with @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , we have ^_b(e_)=a _ -^_n g_nm_e^2b2(1-f_e ) ( e_+q - e_e)=am_e^2b2 ^ 2 _ n=0^n_max g_n e_ep_z , n(1-f_e ) , [ absb]where @xmath57 , and @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] .",

    "henceforth , @xmath65 is similarly defined , and we shall not explicitly write out the lower and upper limits for the sum .",
    "figure 1 depicts @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 as functions of @xmath50 for typical conditions ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 mev , and @xmath74 mev ) in a proto - neutron star .",

    "the matter density is related to @xmath54 via @xmath77 in practice , we have found that for a given @xmath54 , the dependence of @xmath78 on the field strength is rather weak for the range of parameters of interest in this paper .",

    "these resonances reflect the divergence of the density of states of electrons at these stationary landau levels .",
    "the cross section for @xmath80 can be similarly calculated .",

    "to quantitatively understand how the magnetically - modified opacities change the local neutrino flux , we will have to evaluate these opacities at different depths ( corresponding to different physical conditions ) below the neutron star surface , and to perform complete cooling calculations which take into account these opacities .",

    "4 and 5 clearly indicate that , even near the stellar surface , where one expects the modification to the opacities to be most prominent , and even with the most favorable conditions for the magnetic field to be effective in changing the opacities ( i.e. , low density and low temperature ) , a @xmath172 change in the rosseland mean opacity ( for @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) requires a magnetic field with @xmath183 , or @xmath184",
    "g. in the following , we shall content ourselves with merely estimating the change in the local neutrino flux from the modified opacities .",
    "we first consider the case in which the matter temperature throughout the neutron star is unaffected by the magnetic field .",
    "one might imagine this as a possibility if convection dominates energy transfer between different parts of the star .",
    "under the neutrino - matter decoupling layer the specific neutrino energy density @xmath162 is the same as the fermi - dirac function @xmath163 specified by the matter temperature .",
    "the emergent neutrino flux is then inversely proportional to the rosseland mean optical depth @xmath185 from the decoupling layer to the stellar surface ( see eq .  [ [ profile ] ] ) .",
    "since @xmath185 for @xmath0 or @xmath1 at the decoupling layer is of order a few , the flux @xmath157 is inversely proportional to @xmath153 evaluated near the decoupling region .",
    "if we use the curve for @xmath74  mev and @xmath186  mev in fig .  4 ( which has the most pronounced magnetic correction ) , we find that the fractional change in the @xmath0 flux is @xmath187 at @xmath70 ( if we used the curve for @xmath188 or 20  mev , which more closely represents the physical condition at the decoupling region , the modification @xmath189 would be smaller by a factor of a few or more ) . similarly , using the curve for @xmath74  mev in fig .  5 to maximize the magnetic correction , we find @xmath190 at @xmath70 . since the fluxes of other types of neutrinos are unchanged and @xmath191 depend on the @xmath192-@xmath193 scattering cross sections , which can be affected by the magnetic field .",
    "however , the layers are located much deeper than those of @xmath0 and @xmath5 ( since @xmath192-@xmath193 scattering opacity is small ) , the modification to the @xmath192-@xmath193 scattering opacity due to electron landau levels is therefore smaller than the modification to the absorption opacities of @xmath4 and @xmath5 considered in this paper . ] , and since different neutrino species more or less carry away the same amount of energy , the change in the total neutrino flux is only @xmath194 at @xmath70 . if we now imagine that the north pole of the neutron star has @xmath195 while the south pole has a field strength a factor of a few smaller , then , taking into account the geometric reduction ( @xmath196 ) , the flux asymmetry is about @xmath197 , just enough to give a kick velocity of @xmath21  km  s@xmath7 to the neutron star . with @xmath153",
    "evaluated at more realistic conditions , we expect the resulting @xmath178 to be even smaller .",
    "the assumption that the matter temperature is unaffected by the magnetic field ( and therefore spherically symmetric ) is unlikely to be valid . in reality ,",
    "when a region of the star ( say the north pole ) emits more flux , it also cools faster .",
    "with reduced temperature , this region will tend to emit less flux . in the extreme case",
    ", one would find @xmath198 , with @xmath199 the neutrino energy density in the stellar core , and @xmath185 the rosseland mean optical depth from the core to the surface .",
    "since in the bulk interior of the star , modification to @xmath153 due to the magnetic field is negligible , we would conclude that the change in the neutrino flux is much smaller than what is estimated in the last paragraph .    to summarize , the modifications to the absorption opacities of @xmath0 and @xmath5 due to quantized landau levels give rise to rather small change in neutrino fluxes from the neutron star .",
    "to generate appreciable kick velocities ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ) from this effect requires the difference of field strengths at the two opposite poles to be at least @xmath8  g ( and possibly much larger ) .",
