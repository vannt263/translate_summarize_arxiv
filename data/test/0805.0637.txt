    "morphology reflects the integral property of a galaxy , such as stellar populations , gas content , and dynamical structures .",
    "its origin is one of the central problems in the study of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if a galaxy remains isolated after its formation , all of its physical properties would be entirely determined by the initial conditions of the proto - galactic cloud and by the subsequent internal evolution .",
    "but , it seems unlikely because galaxies are believed to form through a series of minor / major mergers .",
    "in fact , the isolated bright galaxies in high density regions are more likely to be recently merged ones and the morphology of galaxies contains imprints of interaction with environment in addition to the formation process ( park , gott , & choi 2008 ) .",
    "there is observational evidence that shows an intimate correlation between the morphology of the central galaxy and its neighbors ( wirth 1983 ; hickson et al .",

    "( 2007 , 2008 ) showed that galaxy morphology does depend on the large - scale background density but the role of the nearest neighbor is more decisive .",
    "the critical roles of the closest neighbor in determining galaxy morphology appear as the galactic conformity ( weinmann et al",
    ". 2006 ) between a galaxy and its neighbors .",
    "galaxy morphology also depends on luminosity in that galaxy morphology is more likely to be early type for brighter galaxies . since bright galaxies mainly live in high density regions through the luminosity - density relation",
    ", it appears that early types are more prevalent at high densities .",
    "satellite systems are good places to inspect the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and to study the galaxy formation process since they are abundant and very localized systems with a size of less than 1 mpc .",
    "most of the previous studies of satellite galaxies were focused on the radial distribution of satellite galaxies ( sales & lambas 2005 ; van den bosch et al . 2005 ; chen et al .",
    "2006 ) , dark matter halo ( mckay et al . 2002 ; prada et al .",

    "the morphology of satellite galaxies is also an observable parameter that is directly related to formation and evolution of galaxy .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the relation between the morphology of satellite galaxies and the local environment such as the host morphology and background density .",
    "we used large and homogeneous morphology samples made by both visual and automated classifications .",
    "we will see a tight correlation between the host and satellites morphologies .",
    "the satellite systems in our study are hosted by the typical bright galaxies , and are not in general large groups or clusters of galaxies .",
    "our host sample is dominated by the @xmath2 galaxies , and their satellites are fainter by about two magnitudes .",
    "the basic source of data is the large - scale structure sample ( lss ) , dr4plus , from the new york university value - added galaxy catalogue ( nyu - vagc ; blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) which is a subset of the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",

    "our survey region covers 4464 deg@xmath6 , which is shown in figure 1 of park et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . to this primary sample",
    ", we added the galaxies brighter than the bright limit ( @xmath7 ) of the sample .",
    "various existing redshift catalogs are searched for the redshifts of the bright galaxies with no spectrum .",
    "the catalogs include rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , catalog of nearby galaxies ( tully & fisher 1988 ) and updated zwicky catalog ( zcat 2000 version ) . in case of no measured redshift even in these catalogs",
    ", we used the redshift taken from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) when available .",
    "we added 5,503 bright galaxies to the primary sample .",
    "the final data set consists of 370,789 galaxies with known redshift and photometry . throughout this paper , we use a flat @xmath8cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    to search for isolated satellite systems",
    "we take two steps .",
    "we first look for isolated galaxies in a volume - limited sample of galaxies brighter than the @xmath3-band absolute magnitude @xmath11 ( hereafter we are going to drop the term @xmath12 ) and with redshifts between 0.02 and 0.04724 .",
    "the lower redshift limit is chosen to make our sample as complete as possible since galaxies with @xmath13 in the sdss seems to be incomplete even though we supplemented bright galaxies ( park et al .",
    "the comoving space number density of galaxies is approximately constant in the radial direction at @xmath14 , but drops significantly at @xmath15 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath16 corresponds to the survey limits of @xmath17 for a galaxy with @xmath0 .",
    "a target galaxy is isolated if the projected separation to its nearest neighbor galaxy is larger than the virial radii of both galaxies .",
    "the neighbors of a target galaxy with @xmath18 are those with absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath19 , and velocity difference less than 1,000 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we have also used the most influential neighbor instead of the nearest one for a comparison in the measurement of the projected separation @xmath21 .",
    "our results are basically the same for these two choices .",
    "the most influential neighbor is the neighbor which induces the highest local density at the location of the target galaxy .",
    "given @xmath21 between them , we calculate the local mass density due to the neighbor with luminosity @xmath22 by @xmath23 where we adopt the mass - to - light ratios @xmath24 for early types and 1 for late types .",
    "this choice is based on the morphology - specific central stellar velocity dispersion and on the pairwise peculiar velocity difference of early and late - type galaxies with their neighbors ( see park et al .",
    "2008 for more details ) .",
    "we define the virial radius of each galaxy as the radius where the mean density within the sphere centered at the galaxy given by equation ( 1 ) becomes the virialized density , which is set to @xmath25 ( see section 3.1 of park et al .",
    "the mean mass density is obtained from @xmath26 where the summation is over all galaxies in our full volume - limited sample of volume @xmath27 with the absolute magnitude constraint @xmath28 .",
    "an early or late - type galaxy with @xmath29 has virial radius of 300 or 240 @xmath30kpc , respectively .",
    "for those with @xmath31 , the virial radii are 350 and 280 @xmath30kpc , respectively .",
    "we found 8,883 isolated galaxies in our volume - limited sample .",
    "they are physically isolated ones in the sense that they are not hydrodynamically interacting with neighbors . in all previous studies isolation",
    "is determined by using a pre - selected fixed radius ignoring the physical size of individual galaxies involved . a blindly large radius of the isolation boundary results in too small sample size , while any fixed value in the right range results in contamination in the sample with interacting galaxies added .",
    "once the bright isolated galaxies are found , we search for satellites associated with them .",
    "we limit the satellite candidates only to galaxies with @xmath18 brighter than @xmath32 , a limit one magnitude fainter than that of the host candidates .",
    "this choice gives us a uniform and complete selection of satellites for host galaxies also uniformly and completely selected across our sample volume ( see figure 1 below ) . at each location of the isolated galaxies we search for galaxies with velocity difference less than 500 km s@xmath20 , absolute magnitude more than one magnitude fainter ( but brighter than @xmath32 ) , and the projected separation less than the smaller of 1 @xmath30mpc and @xmath21(neighbor)@xmath33(neighbor ) , where the letter is the difference between the host - neighbor separation and the neighbor s virial radius .",
    "we used the petrosian @xmath34-band absolute magnitude for satellite identification because @xmath34 magnitude is most similar to the @xmath35 magnitude that is used for some bright galaxies whose sdss photometry is too poor to be used without correction .     difference in radial velocity between a host and its satellites . ]    among the 8,883 isolated galaxies , 2,254 have satellites , and the total number of satellites belonging to these systems is 4,986 .",
    "figure 1 shows the distributions of the host galaxies ( red points ) and satellites ( blue ) .",
    "the host distribution shows our sample boundaries in redshift .",
    "some of the satellites lie beyond the redshift boundaries because we allowed 500 km@xmath36 difference in radial velocity in the search for satellites .",
    "the median absolute magnitude of the hosts is @xmath37 , which is very close to that of the @xmath2 sdss galaxies ( choi et al .",
    "therefore , the host galaxies of our satellite systems are dominated by normal bright galaxies , and are not in general the central @xmath38 galaxies holding the bright galaxies as satellites .",
    "the median absolute magnitude of our satellites is @xmath39 .",
    "so they are not dwarf galaxies , but subluminous bright galaxies typically 1.8 magnitude fainter than their hosts .",
    "since both our hosts and satellites are selected uniformly in the absolute magnitude space , our study of satellite morphology is unbiased against host and satellite luminosity .",
    "we classify the morphology of host galaxies by the visual inspection because visual classification is accurate for bright galaxies . for visual classification , ellipticals(e ) and lenticulars(s0 ) as well as spiral(s ) and irregulars(irr ) are distinguished , but for better statistics we categorized e and s0 galaxies as early types , and s and irr galaxies as late types in the present analysis .",
    "we mainly employed the automated classifier of park & choi ( 2005 ) for satellites .",
    "this classifier divides galaxies into early and late types based on their location in the three - dimensional parameter space of @xmath40 color , @xmath41 color gradient , and the @xmath42-band concentration index .",
    "the classification boundaries in the parameter space are chosen by using a large training set of galaxies with known morphology .",
    "all of the satellites are visually checked .",
    "but the visual classification is used only as a complementary one , especially for relatively bright satellites or for those undergoing close interactions or mergers .",
    "this is because in most cases ( @xmath43 90% ) the visual and automated classifications of satellites agree with each other , and because for the very faint galaxies close to the faint limit of the sample , it is not certain whether or not the visual classification is on average any better than the result of the automated classification .",
    "we measured the early - type fraction @xmath44 and surface number density @xmath45 of satellite galaxies as a function of projected distance ( @xmath46 ) from the host galaxies .",
    "the top panel of figure 2 shows the early - type fraction of satellites associated with our isolated early - type hosts @xmath47 ( filled circles ) and isolated late - type hosts @xmath48 .",
    "the innermost bin is @xmath49 kpc , which corresponds to the fiber collision radius of @xmath50 at the outer boundary ( @xmath16 ) of our volume - limited sample .",
    "it can be noted that @xmath47 is significantly higher than @xmath48 at least out to about 350 @xmath30kpc , which is roughly the virial radius of the typical early - type host galaxies analyzed in this study .",
    "this result means that the morphology of satellites tends to be similar to that of hosts .",
    "it demonstrates the morphology - radius relation at the galactic scales . a similar finding",
    "was reported by weinmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for galaxies in groups and clusters , and by park et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) for galaxy pairs .",
    "for late - type hosts , the early - type satellite fraction increases very slowly as satellites approach their hosts .",
    "some of this effect must be due to the morphology - luminosity relation .",
    "the early - type hosts are in general brighter than the late - type hosts , and correspondingly the satellites of our early - type hosts are also on average brighter than those of late - type hosts due to our satellite finding process , i.e. more than one magnitude fainter relative to the host . because of the morphology - luminosity relation , the morphology of early - type hosts satellites is in general earlier than that of late - type hosts satellites even if there is no direct physical influence of the host on satellites .",
    "we do not think this is the main reason for the host - satellite morphology correlation we found because the satellite morphology is a very strong function of host - satellite separation in early - type host systems and the early - type satellite fractions for early and late - type hosts start to merge at @xmath51mpc .",
    "irrelevance of the morphology - luminosity relation to our findings can be also demonstrated by the early - type satellite fraction plot drawn for hosts with fixed luminosity .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure 2 show the early - type satellite fractions for host galaxies brighter than @xmath52 and fainter than @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we allowed an overlap in @xmath18 to decrease the statistical fluctuations .",
    "we also divided satellites into a subset more than @xmath54 magnitude fainter than the host and a subset more than 1.0 but less than 1.9 magnitude fainter .",
    "drawn are the four cases of early - type hosts ( @xmath55 ) and satellites with @xmath56 ( filled circles , solid line ) , @xmath55 and satellites with @xmath57 ( open circles , dashed line ) , @xmath58 and satellites with @xmath56 ( stars , solid line ) , and @xmath58 and satellites with @xmath57 ( crosses , dashed line ) .",
    "the satellites with smaller @xmath59 are on average brighter than those with larger @xmath59 , and are more likely to be early - types in accordance with the morphology - luminosity relation .",
    "the mean level of @xmath60 at very large @xmath21 is indeed higher for smaller @xmath59 satellites in both middle and bottom panels of figure 2 .",
    "once we subtract the dependence of this asymptotic value on host and satellite luminosity from these figures , interesting dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath21 and host morphology becomes evident .",
    "the fraction of early - type satellites associated with early - type hosts , @xmath61 , depends on @xmath21 more sensitively for fainter satellites ( compare the open and filled circles ) .",
    "this is true for both relatively bright ( middle panel ) and faint ( bottom panel ) hosts .",
    "it can be also noted from the middle and bottom panels that the outer boundary of the region of early - type host influence is farther for brighter hosts .",
    "the net effects of the late - type hosts on satellite morphology seem insignificant .",
    "the satellites of early - type hosts are likely to be deprived of their cold gas through the hydrodynamic and radiative interactions with the x - ray emitting hot gas of their host .",
    "the satellites of late - type hosts are in principle able to get cold gas from their hosts although the hot gas in the halo of late - type hosts can also remove the cold gas in their satellites .",
    "based on a detailed study of morphology - environment relation of galaxy pairs park et al .",
    "( 2008 ) concluded that the galaxy morphology - local density relation is mainly due to the interaction between nearest neighbor galaxies .",
    "when galaxies are closer than their virial radii , they start to interact hydrodynamically and this causes the conformity in morphology of close galaxy pairs .",
    "the present results support their scenario , and this seems to be the origin of the morphology conformity in galactic satellite systems .    one major difference between our result and that of park et al .",
    "is that the satellite morphology does not tend to be of late type as satellites approach late - type host .",
    "the galaxy pairs in park et al.s sample are dominated by those with similar luminosity and therefore their interaction can affect physical properties of both galaxies significantly .",
    "on the other hand , in the current analysis satellites are typically 1.8 magnitudes fainter than hosts , and the influence is largely lopsided from hosts to satellites .",
    "the slight rising tendency of @xmath44 very close to late - type hosts can be because satellites are suffering from cold gas stripping and ionization by the host halo gas , but can not actively catch the cold gas from their hosts as efficiently as companion galaxies having luminosity similar to the hosts .",
    "the slopes of the surface density profiles also reflects the physical effects of their host galaxies on satellites .",
    "figure 3 presents the satellite surface number density profiles for early ( top panel ) and late - type hosts .",
    "the ratio of two profiles in each panel gives the morphology fraction in the top panel of figure 2 .    .",
    "the surface density profiles of satellites hosted by the early - type galaxies are repeated as thin lines in the bottom panel . ]",
    "it demonstrates the number density profile of satellites critically depends on both host and satellite morphology .",
    "the surface density profiles show why @xmath47 decreases more rapidly than @xmath48 .",
    "it is due to the dramatic drop in the surface density of early - type satellites hosted by early - type hosts @xmath62 , and to the slower drop of that of late - type satellites hosted by early - type hosts @xmath63 .",
    "this makes late - type satellites dominant in the satellite systems of early - type hosts at @xmath64 @xmath30 kpc , where the exact location depending on the host luminosity and the host - satellite magnitude difference ( see figure 2 ) . in the systems hosted by late - type galaxies , late - type satellites are dominant at all @xmath21 .",
    "the shapes of the surface density profiles of both early and late - type satellites , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , are similar to each other , making their ratio roughly constant of @xmath21 . at large separations , @xmath67kpc , the surface densities satellites belonging to early - type ( upper panel ) and late - type ( lower panel ) hosts approach roughly the same ratio , resulting in @xmath68 .",
    "this seems the field value of galaxy morphology for galaxies having absolute magnitudes similar to those of the satellites in our sample .",
    "the morphology fraction shown in figure 2 is the result of projection of the three dimensional distribution on the sky . in order to get a rough idea on the central morphology fraction we try to deproject the profile as follows .",
    "we assume the radial number density of each of early and late - type satellites follows a power - low , @xmath69 .",
    "then the projected density follows the form ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , @xmath70 the parameters in the fraction are obtained from a least - square fit to the inner - most three points shown in figure 3 for each case of host and satellite morphology .",
    "only two parameters are free .",
    "we found the slope of the three - dimensional profile is @xmath71 at @xmath72 except for the late - type satellite associated with early - type host case , which has about -1.5 .",
    "the true fraction of early - type satellites very close to early - type hosts is found to reach about 0.71 and 0.78 at @xmath73 and 10@xmath30kpcs , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction for late - type hosts in 3d is nearly the same as that shown in figure 2 because the slope of radial density profile is almost independent of satellite morphology in this case .",
    "as argued in the previous sections , the morphology conformity in galactic satellite systems seems to be due to the local effects of hosts on their satellites .",
    "however , the galactic conformity can be affected by the global environment as well as local one .",
    "park et al . ( 2008 ) showed that , even though the morphology of galaxies depends mainly on luminosity and the small - scale environment due to the nearest neighbor , it also depends on the large - scale background density .",
    "the dependence of galaxy morphology on the large - scale density was found even when both the luminosity of the target galaxy and the environment due to the nearest neighbor were fixed .",
    "this was explained by the dependence of the hot halo gas of galaxies on the large - scale density . in this section",
    "we look for a similar effect on galactic satellites .",
    "we used the galaxy number density estimator defined by 20 nearest @xmath2 galaxies with @xmath74 drawn from the full volume - limited sample @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a spline - kernel weight and @xmath77 is the mean number density of the @xmath2 galaxies in the sdss .",
    "this choice is the same as those used by park et al .",
    "the median value of the effective gaussian smoothing scale , corresponding to the adaptive spline smoothing , is @xmath78 mpc .",
    "the top panel of figure 4 shows the distributions of the large - scale density for early - type ( solid line ) and late - type ( dotted ) hosts .",
    "it can be seen that their distributions are nearly the same except for the highest densiy bin even though the early - type galaxies are in general preferentially located at higher densities .",
    "this may be because the isolation constraint on hosts excluded more early - type galaxies than late - types in high density regions .",
    "however , as can be seen in the bottom panel of figure 4 , our isolated host sample still respects the luminosity - density relation .        .",
    "]    figure 5 shows @xmath44 as a function of the projected separation from the hosts in different large - scale background density regions .",
    "we fixed the luminosity of host galaxies to @xmath79 to separate the luminosity effects from the background density effects on galaxy morphology .",
    "the large scale environment is divided into high and low density regions with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , where @xmath82 is the median density for our isolated hosts .",
    "it can be seen in figure 5 that @xmath44 is higher in high density regions for both early and late - type hosts with fixed luminosity .",
    "the background density seems to play a definite role in determining the morphology of galactic satellites .",
    "the background density can directly affect the satellites , or affect them indirectly through the host whose properties depend statistically on the background density .",
    "park et al . ( 2008 ) found that the early - type galaxies in high density regions have higher x - ray luminosity than those in low density regions even when their optical luminosity is the same .",
    "this means that the hot halo gas of early - type galaxies is hotter and denser at high densities .",
    "taking into account this finding we interpret the background density dependence of the satellite morphology as due to the hydrodynamic and radiative effects of the hot gas of host galaxies on satellites .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , even though @xmath83 is generally higher in high density regions in figure 5 , it is so only when satellites are close to their hosts and @xmath83 at @xmath21 much larger than the host s virial radius is rather independent of the background density .",
    "if the background density directly affect the morphology of satellites , the satellite morphology should depend on the background density at all host - satellite separations .",
    "it can be also noted that @xmath44 is higher for early - type hosts than for late - type hosts both in high and low density regions .",
    "therefore , the conformity in morphology at galactic scales prevails in both high and low density environments .",
    "the @xmath44 in high density environment decreases almost linearly with @xmath46 while @xmath44 in low density environment decreases nearly exponentially .",
    "it is surprising to see this background density dependence even if we fixed host morphology and luminosity .",
    "all @xmath44 seems to converge at @xmath84 @xmath30 kpc .",
    "this is a scale a little larger than the virial radius of the host galaxies under consideration .",
    "the virial radii are about 280 and 350 @xmath30kpc for late and early - type galaxies with @xmath31 . in the analysis of luminous galaxy pairs the dependence of galaxy morphology on the neighbor s morphology appears at separations of @xmath85 ( park et al .",
    "this was explained by the hydrodynamic interactions between the pairs within the virialized region .",
    "previous studies showed that the fraction of interlopers could be large at large @xmath21 ( prada et al .",
    "2003 ) and that the interloper fraction depends on the color of the satellites , with interlopers being rare amongst the red satellites , but making up about half of the blue satellites . if our satellite samples were dominated by interlopers at large @xmath21 , the difference in @xmath83 in high and low density regions could be due simply to the interlopers which respect the morphology - density relation .",
    "however , figure 5 shows that @xmath86 converges to about 0.2 both in high and low density regions and both for early- and late - type host galaxies .",
    "therefore , the satellites at large separations do not show the trends that are expected for the general background galaxies .",
    "this indicates our results are not significantly affected by interlopers .",
    "we have found the morphology - radius relation for galactic satellite systems .",
    "early - type satellites are prevalent in the vicinity of early type hosts .",
    "the origin of the conformity in morphology is thought to be the hydrodynamic and radiative effects of hosts on satellites in addition to the tidal ( gravitational ) effects .",
    "the satellite morphology is found to depend on the large - scale background density . in high density regions",
    "the early - type fraction of satellites decreases relatively slowly beyond the virial radius of the host galaxy .",
    "however , in low density regions the fraction of satellites with early morphological type drops sharply at separations of @xmath87kpc for both early and late - type host systems .",
    "as we fixed the mass of host galaxies by fixing luminosity and morphology , this difference must be coming from non - gravitational effects .",
    "it is argued that the hot halo gas of the host galaxies is responsible for prevalence of early - type satellites in the vicinity of hosts , and that in high density regions the hot halo gas can be more confined by the ambient intergalactic medium and has higher density and temperature , which can better deplete the cold gas in satellites more efficiently .",
    "the galactic conformity found from the present sample of satellite systems is not much affected by the detailed selection criteria of the satellites .",
    "the magnitude difference between host and satellites is not critical because we obtained similar results for the satellite systems defined by different magnitude differences .",
    "using the most - influential neighbors instead of the nearest neighbors in identification of isolated hosts and satellites also did not make much difference .",
    "we also examined whether or not our results are affected by our isolation requirement for host galaxies , and found that all of our results qualitatively remain the same .",
    "we made exactly the same analysis for satellites defined for host galaxies which are not constrained to be isolated . in this analysis",
    "a galaxy becomes a satellite if it finds a host galaxy within @xmath88kpc that is more than 2 magnitudes brighter and has velocity difference less than 500 km s@xmath20 . if there is more than one such hosts , the closest one is chosen .",
    "hosts are limited to @xmath89 , and satellites have @xmath90 .",
    "we found 8,353 satellites in 3,472 systems .",
    "we obtain basically the same results for these satellite systems as for the isolated ones but with much higher statistical significances . therefore , our results are robust against various choices of parameters used to identify hosts and satellites . in the forthcoming paper",
    "we will study the shape and internal properties of satellites . rather than dividing satellites into early and late types , we will adopt a new classification scheme that is more appropriate for the satellite galaxies .",
    "we found this is necessary because our satellite galaxies are fainter and located in the special environment given by the hosts compared to the normal bright galaxies for which the usual morphology classification schemes are developed .",

    "<S> we have studied the radial distribution of the early ( e / s0 ) and late ( s / irr ) types of satellites around bright host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we made a volume - limited sample of 4,986 satellites brighter than @xmath0 associated with 2,254 hosts brighter than @xmath1 from the sdss dr5 sample . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of satellites is determined by an automated morphology classifier , but the host galaxies are visually classified . </S>",
    "<S> we found segregation of satellite morphology as a function of the projected distance from the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude and shape of the early - type satellite fraction profile are found to depend on the host luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this is the morphology - radius / density relation at the galactic scale . </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong tendency for morphology conformity between the host galaxy and its satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the early - type fraction of satellites hosted by early - type galaxies is systematically larger than that of late - type hosts , and is a strong function of the distance from the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> fainter satellites are more vulnerable to the morphology transformation effects of hosts . </S>",
    "<S> dependence of satellite morphology on the large - scale background density was detected . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of early - type satellites increases in high density regions for both early and late - type hosts . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the conformity in morphology of galactic satellite system is mainly originated by the hydrodynamical and radiative effects of hosts on satellites .    </S>",
