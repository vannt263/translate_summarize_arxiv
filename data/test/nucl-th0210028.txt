    "apart from a recent work by doleschall and borbly@xcite , non - locality in the nn interaction has not been the object of dedicated studies for a long time .",
    "it is not absent however in models where it appears most often as a by - product of some prejudice in their construction . in the paris model@xcite , for instance , it was realized that an energy dependence could help in fitting nn scattering data .",
    "the transformation of this energy dependence into a @xmath4 dependence provides a non - local component .",
    "later on , the bonn group produced a model , field - theory motivated , taking into account the coupling of the @xmath5 channel to @xmath6 , n@xmath7 , @xmath8 channels@xcite .",
    "it contains both a spatial and a time - non - locality .",
    "moreover , the improvement consisting in introducing the dirac spinors to describe @xmath9-spin particles also provides non - locality .",
    "one could add other examples that have not been concretized in a high accuracy model . taking into account the substructure of nucleons and mesons in terms of quarks most often leads to a non - locality@xcite , which is better expressed in configuration space than in momentum one , contrarily to the above sources of non - locality .",
    "a double question may be raised about this non - locality .",
    "does it help in explaining nn scattering data and how this could be evidenced ?",
    "on the other hand , taking into account that a non - locality can be transformed away by a unitary transformation ( wave by wave ) , one can wonder whether the different models on the market are independent of each other ?    concerning the first question ,",
    "some answer is obtained by examining models such as the versions nij1 ( non - local ) and nij2 ( local ) of the nijmegen group@xcite .",
    "they equally fit the scattering phase shifts ( @xmath10 ) , but in the first case , this is achieved with 41 parameters while 47 are required in the other one .",
    "the slightly smaller number in the former case perhaps provides indication that the introduction of some non - locality is beneficial .",
    "the second question is the main object of the present paper .",
    "the plan will be as follows . in the second section",
    ", we present the different non - local terms which we are interested in .",
    "how they can be removed by a unitary transformation at the first order is given .",
    "the third section is devoted to a few selected results concerning the deuteron : static properties , form factors , structure function ( @xmath0 ) and the tensor polarization ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "it involves a comparison of these quantities obtained with different models when the effect of the non - locality is taken into account .",
    "section four contains the conclusion and a discussion . due to a lack of space",
    ", we concentrate here on the essential points .",
    "details and extended results could be found in refs .",
    "the interaction of interest here may be written : @xmath11 .",
    "\\label{def}\\ ] ] where the non - local terms take the form of an anticommutator or a commutator .",
    "another term of same order could be considered but those retained here are the only ones appearing in the pion - exchange contribution when this one is expanded up to order @xmath12 . due to its long range , it a priori provides larger contributions .",
    "moreover , they are theoretically well identified while shorter range contributions are likely to have some effective character .",
    "the last term in the above equation has been studied at length in refs .",
    "though it has a different origin , it has a strong similarity with a term arising from the difference of pseudo - scalar and pseudo - vector @xmath13 couplings , considered in an earlier work by friar@xcite . as for the anticommutator terms ,",
    "only rough estimates were made in the past .",
    "they are considered more completely here .    in principle , if two models are unitary equivalent , the corresponding hamiltonians , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , should fulfill the following relation : @xmath16 at the first order in the interaction , the quantity , @xmath17 , appearing in the unitary transformation , @xmath18 , can be determined by requiring : @xmath19= \\delta\\,v^0 \\ ; ,   \\label{req}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 has to be local .",
    "this equation is fulfilled as follows : @xmath21 with @xmath22 it is noticed that the difference of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) involves two - body but also many - body terms .",
    "similarly , if a one - body current is introduced in one representation , the other one contains two , ... body currents to ensure the unitary equivalence .",
    "the role of the two - body part is examined in the following section .",
    "applications involve the interaction models : nij2@xcite , argonne v18@xcite , reid93@xcite which are local ones , nij1@xcite , nij93@xcite , paris@xcite which have a linearly @xmath4 dependence , and the bonn - qb , bonn - cd ones@xcite .",
    "concerning static properties , a quantity of interest is the deuteron d - state probability , often referred to characterize different models .",
    "the difference between the paris and bonn - qb model is 0.78% . as the two models have quite close values for the mixing parameters , @xmath25 , their comparison is largely free of bias with this respect .",
    "taking into account the effect of the non - local term , @xmath26 , explains 0.74% ( 0.60% and 0.14% for the commutator and anti - commutator parts respectively ) .",
    "notice that the change in the deuteron d - state probability just reflects the fact that this quantity is not an observable one .",
    "similar results were reached by von geramb et al.@xcite , using the inverse scattering problem methods .",
    "another interesting quantity is the ratio @xmath27 , which , contrary to the above one , is observable .",
    "the difference is 0.23 @xmath28 while @xmath26 explains 0.20 @xmath28 .",
    "it is also instructive to look at quantities that only depend on the scalar anticommutator part of @xmath26 . in this order , we compare the squared charge radius for the models nij1 and nij2 .",
    "the models differ by an amount of 0.004 @xmath29 while the effect of the non - locality is estimated to be around 0.001 @xmath29 .",
    "the apparent failure to explain the discrepancy in this case actually points to the difference of the models for the asymptotic normalization @xmath2 , which as is well known , governs the size of the charge radius .",
    "this factor is not affected by the present analysis of non - local effects",
    ".    ratios of form factors and related quantities calculated in different representations of the interaction should go to 1 when the non - locality effect is accounted for and provided that the unitary equivalence is ensured .",
    "it is not so in practice because the unitary transformation is treated at first order . in each case",
    ", there are thus two sets of results , depending on whether corrections are added to predictions made with one model or removed from the other ones",
    ".    ratios of predictions made from the bonn - qb and paris models for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 observables are shown in fig .",
    "as it can be seen , the ratio of bare predictions ( continuous line ) tends to 1 when the effect of the anticommutator ( dashed and dotted lines ) and commutator terms ( small - dash and dashed - dotted lines ) is considered .",
    "a large part of the effect is due to the tensor part of @xmath26 .",
    "notice that a slight departure from 1 appears for @xmath1 around @xmath30 . the effect of the scalar part of the anticommutator , which is seen in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "( left part ) , shows features similar to the previous ones .",
    "it involves the s - wave function close to the origin , which is generally suppressed in local models compared to non - local ones .",
    "the right part of the same figure emphasizes a case where an agreement between two models turns into a disagreement .",
    "in fact , this one is consistent with what is expected from the comparison of the asymptotic normalization , unaffected by the present analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , all predictions corrected for the effect of a non - local term are compared to the paris ones . at low @xmath31 , it is seen that some discrepancy is still present while the initial motivation of the work was rather to explain it by non - locality effects .",
    "actually , for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the discrepancy reflects a sensitivity to the @xmath32 ratio in the first case and @xmath2 in the second one .",
    "around @xmath33 , the ratio becomes very close to 1 , while in absence of corrections departures up to 10% and 20% respectively could be observed .",
    "the decrease of the uncertainty has motivated schiavella and sick in using the quadrupole form factor to derive the neutron charge form factor@xcite .",
    "effects of non - local terms in nn interaction models have been considered .",
    "roughly , they explain a large part of the differences that the comparison of various model predictions for electromagnetic observables evidences .",
    "the part with a tensor character has been found to be the dominant one .",
    "it is also the best determined .",
    "similar conclusions hold in some cases for the scalar part but the effect is often masked by other effects related to the fact that models correspond to different values of the asymptotic normalization , @xmath2 , which is an observable and remains unchanged in the analysis performed here .    while the original goal of present studies was rather to relate discrepancies between models to some non - locality , it appears that this is not always possible , especially at low @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly however , accounting for this effect tends to restore some hierarchy of the results , as expected from simple models .",
    "thus , in the above range , the structure function , @xmath0 , and the quadrupole form factor , @xmath34 , evidence a direct sensitivity respectively to the asymptotic normalizations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are unaffected by the present analysis of non - local effects .",
    "the result of the analysis presented here was not a priori guaranteed .",
    "the fact that it points to a unique family of phase - equivalent models indicates that the sensitivty of the models to different parametrizations of the radial part for instance or to a different fit to experimental data is rather small .",
    "thus , the availability of various models is not without interest . the remaining sensitivity , as for @xmath2 or equivalently the scattering length , @xmath35 , strongly calls for a more accurate determination of these quantities .",
    "throughout the present study , we compare together predictions of models for electromagnetic observables .",
    "ultimately , a comparison to experiment should be done . in this respect ,",
    "a model to be prefered , most probably non - local , is that one based on degrees of freedom of which effectice character , unavoidable in any case , is as low as possible",
