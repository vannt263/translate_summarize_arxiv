    "triggered by the creation of the first bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , the field of ultracold atoms has experienced many major advancements .",
    "nowadays it is not only possible to steer and observe many - body effects like the mott - insulator superfluid phase transition  @xcite but also to manipulate single atoms in an optical lattice ( ol ) or a dipole trap  @xcite .",
    "a key technology is the dynamical variation of the trapping potential that allows , e.g. , for a cooling of the system by transferring hot atoms to non - trapped continuum states  @xcite . in a recent work by some of us",
    "it has been proposed how to perform quantum computations in an ol just by manipulating the depth of single lattice sites and by shaking the optical lattice to drive transitions between different bloch bands  @xcite . for a full understanding of the underlying dynamical processes of any multi - band system @xcite the application of",
    "the usually employed single - band hubbard model is insufficient . here ,",
    "a numerical approach is presented , that solves the full time - dependent schrdinger equation of two interacting atoms in a single - well or multiple - well lattice , which can be perturbed by any additional time - dependent potential up to quadratic order .",
    "while the types of perturbations can be easily extended , the currently implemented types already allow for studying many experimentally relevant situations .",
    "for example , an acceleration of an ol or a periodic driving as realized in @xcite results in a linear perturbation of the lattice .",
    "the manipulation of the barrier hight between two lattice sites @xcite or a variation of the global confinement , e.g. by a mot @xcite , can be simulated by adding a harmonic perturbation .",
    "the general problem of a precise description of interacting atoms in trapping potentials is the existence of two very distinct length scales : that of the short - range born - oppenheimer interaction ( some 100 a.u . ) and that of the trapping potential ( some @xmath0 a.u . ) .",
    "the employed basis functions have to cover the highly oscillating behavior in the interaction range and the slow variation due to the trap .",
    "the use of an uncorrelated basis such as a regular grid or products of single - particle solutions is therefore impractical .",
    "a method to avoid the length scale problem is to replace the interaction potential by a delta - like pseudo potential that supports only a single bound state and can be adjusted to have the same @xmath1-wave scattering length as the full interaction potential  @xcite . in this case",
    "the problem can be tackled , e.g. , by choosing a basis of multi - band wannier functions of the optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , effects of higher partial waves or of an energy dependence of the scattering length , that can easily become important if multiple bloch bands are occupied  @xcite , are ignored by this approach . here , the problem is approached by using the stationary solutions of the lattice potential obtained by a procedure presented in @xcite . for this , the hamiltonian is first separated into relative ( rel . ) motion and center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
