    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments have provided significant amount of evidence which confirms the existence of the non - zero yet tiny neutrino masses @xcite . the smallness of neutrino masses compared to electroweak scale can naturally be explained by seesaw mechanism @xcite , the simplest version of which corresponds to the inclusion of three singlet right handed neutrinos into the standard model .",
    "although these seesaw models can naturally explain the smallness of neutrino mass compared to the electroweak scale , we still do not have a complete understanding of the origin of neutrino mass hierarchies as suggested by experiments .",
    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , daya - bay @xcite and reno @xcite have not only made the earlier predictions for neutrino parameters more precise , but also predicted non - zero value of the reactor mixing angle @xmath0 . the latest global fit value for @xmath1 range of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite are as follows : @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where nh and ih refers to normal and inverted hierarchy respectively .",
    "although the next generation neutrino oscillation experiments are expected to shed light on the origin of mass hierarchies as well as the dirac cp phase , it is worth exploring if there exists an alternate experimentally verifiable way to understand some of the yet unresolved issues in neutrino physics",
    ". it will be even more exciting if such alternate ways can also confirm or rule out some of the well motivated beyond standard model frameworks which may or may not be seen in collider experiments .",
    "it turns out that the neutrino telescopes which have been designed to observe high energy cosmic rays , can be a promising setup to search for new physics .",
    "the consequences of many such well motivated new physics scenarios on the observations of neutrino flux observed by neutrino telescopes have been studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "motivated by these , here we pursue a similar study on the possibility of observing new physics at neutrino telescopes .",
    "in particular , we focus on high energy neutrinos coming from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and present an analysis of how the expected total flux of neutrinos at neutrino telescopes can change significantly by the presence of new physics . among new physics scenarios ,",
    "we consider neutrino decay , presence of one light sterile neutrino and pseudo dirac nature of neutrinos .    inside a grb , shock accelerated protons may interact with low energy photons leading to the production of high energy mesons @xmath8 and these pions subsequently decay to high energy neutrinos @xmath9 .",
    "this flux has already calculated in @xcite .",
    "recently icecube collaboration has claimed to reach the sensitivity of detecting neutrino flux from grbs at tev energy @xcite .",
    "the combined operation of icecube 40 and 59 string for the time period of april 5 , 2008 to may 2010 for grb neutrinos has placed a tighter upper bound , 3.7 times below the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recalculated the neutrino flux from the 215 grbs used by icecube during their period of detection , and concluded that the neutrino flux predicted theoretically in the papers by icecube collaborations is an overestimation .",
    "however @xmath10 in grbs can also produce high energy neutrons , and they will decay as @xmath11 to antineutrinos @xcite .",

    "so one can find the total neutrino flux from grbs has a contribution from these processes too .",
    "using the above mentioned possible origin of high energy neutrino flux from grbs and the best fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters ( [ globalfit ] ) , we show that the individual neutrino flux can change significantly from the ones expected from standard oscillation paradigm .",
    "more specifically , the scenario of neutrino decay can change the expected flux to a great extent , wheareas the changes in the scenario of sterile neutrino and pseudo - dirac neutrino are somewhat moderate and should be detectable in future neutrino telescopes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we discuss the possible ways high energy neutrinos can originate in grbs .",
