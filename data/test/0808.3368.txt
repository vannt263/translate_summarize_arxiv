    "it has been 60 years since casimir @xcite found a profound explanation for the retarded van der waals interaction as a manifestation of the zero - point energy of the quantum electromagnetic field . for many years",
    "the casimir effect was little more than a theoretical curiosity . but",
    "interest in the phenomenon has blossomed in recent years .",
    "experimental physicists have realized that the casimir force affects the workings of micromachined devices , while advances in instrumentation have enabled the force to be measured with ever - greater accuracy . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "considerable progress has also been achieved by studying the dependence of the casimir force with the geometry of the conducting surfaces @xcite .    up to now , most experiments aiming at a measurement of the casimir force have been performed with parallel plates @xcite , or with a sphere in front of a plane @xcite .",
    "the parallel plates configuration has a stronger signal , but the main experimental difficulty is to achieve parallelism between the plates .",
    "this problem is of course not present in the case of a sphere in front of a plane , but its drawback is that the force is several orders of magnitude smaller . the problem of the theoretical evaluation of the electromagnetic force for this configuration has been solved recently @xcite .",
    "the configuration of two eccentric cylinders have both experimental and theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "although parallelism is as difficult as for the plane - plane configuration , the fact that the concentric configuration is an unstable equilibrium position opens the possibility of measuring the derivative of the force using null experiments ( for example , one could consider experimental configurations in which a metallic wire is placed inside a larger hollow cylinder ) .",
    "the casimir interaction energy between two eccentric cylindrical shells has been computed in @xcite , and was initially reported in @xcite .",
    "therein , it was used the mode summation technique combined with the argument theorem in order to write the casimir energy as a contour integral in the complex plane , to end with an exact formula in which the vacuum energy is written in terms of the determinant of an infinite matrix . as a bonus",
    ", it has also been shown that the matrix elements in the general formula for two eccentric cylinders reproduce , as a limiting case of relevance , those of the casimir energy for the cylinder - plane configuration .",
    "the latter geometry is also of experimental interest : being intermediate between the sphere - plane and the plane - plane geometries , it can shed some light on the longstanding controversy about thermal corrections to the casimir force . keeping the two plates parallel",
    "has proved very difficult , while the sphere and plate configuration avoids this problem , the force is not extensive . in the case of the cylinder - plane configuration ,",
    "it is easier to hold the cylinder parallel and the force results extensive in its length .",
    "there is an ongoing experiment to measure the casimir force for this configuration @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a precise numerical evaluation of the analytical results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluations will allow as to test different approximations , as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) for close surfaces , and the `` around the diagonal '' approximation for quasi concentric cylinders .",
    "we will also show numerically that the energy of the eccentric cylinders configuration reproduces that of the cylinder - plane configuration , in the limit of very large eccentricity , when the radius of the external cylinder is also very large .",
    "finally , we will present a detailed numerical evaluation for the vacuum energy for the cylinder - plane configuration , providing numerical support for the analytic predictions of the first order corrections to pfa @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ numeric ]",
    "we will discuss the general procedure used for the numerical evaluation of the casimir energy in every case considered . in section [ eccentric ] , we will evaluate the exact formula for the interaction energy between eccentric cylinders .",
    "the complexity of the numerical evaluation increases as the radii of the cylinders get closer , and we provide details of the size of the matrices needed to assure convergence of the numerical results . in section [ quasi ] we analyze the particular case of quasi - concentric cylinders .",
    "we test the validity of the approximation developed in @xcite , based on tridiagonal matrices , that we extend to the next order by considering pentadiagonal matrices . in section [ concentric ]",
    "we consider the particular case of concentric cylinders .",
    "we will obtain a new analytic result in the small distance limit , that includes the corrections to pfa up to the second order .",
    "we will also present an improved numerical method to evaluate the interaction energy at small distances .",
    "finally , in section [ cp ] , we will numerically show that the interaction energy for the cylinder - plane configuration can be derived in the appropriate limit from the eccentric cylinders configuration , a result that was anticipated analytically for the matrix elements in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will evaluate numerically the cylinder - plane casimir energy as the minimum distance between the surfaces is much smaller than the radius of the cylinder .",
    "we will be able to show numerically that the energy is well reproduced in this limit by the pfa , and to compute the first order correction to pfa for both tm and te modes . in the first case ( tm ) ,",
    "the fits of the numerical data reproduce with high precision the analytic prediction @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fits for te modes are close to the analytic results or not , depending on the assumption about the higher order corrections .",

    "however , it is possible to go beyond the pfa and find an exact formula for the interaction energy @xcite .",
    "this can be done using a mode by mode summation technique combined with the argument theorem . by starting with the expression of the casimir energy as @xmath2 ,",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the casimir interaction energy for two eccentric cylinders can be written as @xmath3   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & e^{\\rm te}+e^{\\rm tm } , \\label{e12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath6 is a dimensionless integration variable and @xmath7 are arbitrary integers . roughly speaking ,",
    "the function @xmath8 that determines the casimir energy through eq.([e12 ] ) is such that its zeros give the eigenfrequencies of the geometric configuration .",
    "more precisely , it is the ratio of the function associated to the actual geometric configuration and the one associated to a configuration in which the conducting surfaces are very far away from each other @xcite .",

    "in order to calculate the casimir interaction energy , one needs to perform a numerical evaluation of the determinants in eq.([e12 ] ) , followed by a numerical integration in the variable @xmath17 .",
    "we find that as @xmath18 approaches small values , larger matrices are needed for ensuring convergence . likewise , as @xmath19 , the contribution to the integral",
    "is significative for a bigger integration range ( bigger values of @xmath17 contribute ) . that turns the problem into a real challenge from the numerical point of view .",
    "we numerically compute the casimir interaction energy using a fortran program .",

    "the parameters used by the program are : the dimension of the @xmath8 matrix ( n , n ) , the number of addends @xmath20 corresponding to each element of the m matrix , the integration limit ( @xmath21 ) and the precision desired . the difficulty in running the programme lays in the compromise taken between all the parameters chosen .    in the following",
    ", we will evaluate the casimir interaction energy for eccentric , quasi concentric , concentric cylinders , and also for the particular limit of a cylinder in front of a plane .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results for the casimir interaction energy for two eccentric cylinders given by eqs.([fulltm ] ) and ( [ fullte ] ) .     between the eccentric and concentric configurations as a function of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath23 .",
    "here @xmath24 .",

    "these numerical results interpolate between the pfa and the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath28 @xcite . in fig.[njpfig4 ] we show the casimir interaction energy difference as a function of @xmath29 for various values of @xmath28 .",
    "again , it is evident that the equilibrium position ( @xmath30 ) is unstable .    in refs.@xcite similar plots",
    "were performed using an algebraic evaluation of the trace of the matrix @xmath8 , and a numerical integration , both using mathematica . due to this procedure , it was possible to evaluate the vacuum energy only for relatively large values of the parameter @xmath28 , in order to reach convergence . with the numerical method we are presenting here , we are able to include smaller values of @xmath28 , closer to the pfa region , where previous numerical calculations could not reach .",
    "both in fig.[njpfig3 ] and fig.[njpfig4 ] we include runs for @xmath31 . in order to achieve so , we have used matrices of dimension ( 21,21 ) and 501 addends in the sums of eqs .",

    "the size of @xmath8 for the runs was set by the smaller values of @xmath28 that needed bigger @xmath8 matrix to obtain the same accuracy .     between the eccentric and concentric configurations as a function of @xmath23 for different values of @xmath22 .",

    "in this section , we consider the situation in which the eccentricity of the configuration is much smaller than the radius of the inner cylinder ( @xmath40 ) . for a small non - vanishing eccentricity ,",
    "the behaviour of the bessel functions in eqs.([fulltm ] ) and ( [ fullte ] ) is @xmath41 for small arguments .",
    "this suggests that the main contribution should be the one coming from the diagonal elements , and that one only needs to use matrix elements near the diagonal .",

    "we present a detailed computation of the vacuum energy for the cylinder - plane configuration . in fig.[ltcpfig1 ] we present the casimir interaction energy for the cylinder - plane configuration obtained by the use of our fortran program . for the runs",
    ", we used a matrix of dimension ( 101,101 ) to reach the proximity area ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that for smaller values of @xmath109 , we need to increase the dimension of the a matrix and the integration range of @xmath17 in eq.([e12 ] ) .",
    "this fact becomes our major limitation to reach yet smaller values of @xmath109 .    .",
    "a simple fit @xmath122 of the numerical data for @xmath123 gives @xmath124 and @xmath125.,width=328 ]    we now discuss in more detail the limit @xmath126 . this problem has been considered from an analytical point of view in ref.@xcite . using the uniform expansions for the bessel functions appearing in the matrix elements @xmath110 and @xmath110 , and after complex calculations , it can be shown that , in the proximity limit : @xmath127 @xmath128 where we have written separately the contributions of tm and te modes .    .",
    "a simple linear fit @xmath129 of the numerical data in the interval @xmath130 gives @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the theoretical values are @xmath106 and @xmath133.,width=328 ]    .different fits for the numerical results of fig .",
    "we fix @xmath134 since the numerical data agree this value with high precision . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     . a simple linear",
    "fit @xmath129 of the numerical data in the interval @xmath130 gives @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the theoretical values are @xmath106 and @xmath137.,width=328 ]    .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140.,width=328 ]    we will discuss the first order corrections to pfa for tm and te modes separately . in fig.[cptm ] , we show our numerical results for the tm modes .",
    "the fit of the numerical results depends of course on the interval chosen for @xmath141 .",
    "there is an obvious compromise : on the one hand , as already mentioned , we can not consider very small values for @xmath141 because of numerical limitations . on the other hand ,",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath141 are expected to be valid only for @xmath142 . in any case , as can be seen from table i , the different fits for the numerical results are stable , and confirm both the pfa to leading and next to leading orders .",
    "indeed , the results are fully compatible with the analytic results given in eq.([e12cpbtm ] ) , considering both linear and quadratic fits of the numerical results .",
    "moreover , a simple linear fit in a smaller range of @xmath141 gives @xmath131 and @xmath143 and already reproduces the analytical results @xcite with high accuracy ( see also numerical findings in @xcite ) .    in fig.[cpte",
    "] , we show our results for the neumann modes , and we include in table ii different fits of the numerical data . in this case , the value obtained for the linear correction to pfa depends strongly on the assumption about the next non trivial correction .",
    "this is not surprising : as we can not consider extremely small values for @xmath141 , the non linear corrections may have a non negligible contribution in the intervals chosen for the fits .",
    "for example , a simple linear fit gives @xmath144 and @xmath145 which does not coincide with the result in eq.([e12cpbte ] ) .",
    "however , based on the discussion about the slower convergence of the neumann corrections presented in ref.@xcite , we have allowed the possibility of non linear corrections proportional to @xmath146 in our fits .",
    "remarkably , when this non linear corrections are taken into account , the coefficient of the linear correction gets closer to the analytic prediction in eq.([e12cpbte ] ) , that we reproduce with an error less than @xmath147 . note",
    "that , as can be seen in fig.[cptm ] , this is not the case for tm modes , since the best fit of the numerical data contains a quadratic term without a logarithm . in fig.13",
    "we show a fit of the numerical data for tm modes that includes a cubic correction @xmath148 . with this additional term",
    ", the fit reproduces the numerical data up to @xmath149 .    to summarize",
    ", the fits of the numerical data clearly confirm the analytic prediction for the tm modes , and suggest that the next non trivial correction for the te modes is not quadratic but proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "we have numerically evaluated the casimir interaction energy for the two eccentric cylinders configuration and for the cylinder plane geometry , extending in several directions the numerical results presented in ref.@xcite . for quasi concentric cylinders",
    ", we have shown that the approximation based on tridiagonal matrices derived in @xcite is in good agreement with the numerical values .",
    "we also extended this approximation to the case of pentadiagonal matrices .",
    "our results show that , for small eccentricities , it is far more efficient to consider the contribution of the matrix elements near the diagonal , than a `` tour de force '' numerical calculation based on the exact formula .    for concentric cylinders ,",
    "we have obtained analytically the quadratic corrections to the pfa .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first explicit non linear correction to pfa existing in the literature .",
    "we have also shown that the pfa can be used as a useful tool in order to improve the numerical evaluation at very small distances , and we have used this improvement in order to check numerically the non linear correction to pfa .",
    "finally , we have analyzed in detail some numerical results for the cylinder - plane geometry .",
    "on the one hand , we have shown that the casimir energy for this configuration can be obtained from that of the two eccentric cylinders .",
    "although this coincidence has been anticipated for the matrix elements in ref.@xcite , the numerical data show that the result is also valid for the energy . on the other hand ,",
    "we have computed the te and tm contributions to the energy for small distances , and compared the fits of the numerical results with existing analytic predictions for the linear corrections to the pfa .",
