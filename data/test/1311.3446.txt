    "the interacting galaxy arp  299 ( mrk  171 , ic  694+ngc  3690 ) was identified as a mid - infrared ( mir ) luminous source @xcite more than 40 years ago .",
    "subsequently , @xcite detected two bright @xmath5 m sources coincident with the galaxy nuclei ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , referred to as arp  299-a or the nucleus of the eastern component ( ic  694 ) and arp  299-b or the nucleus of the western component ( ngc  3690 ) .",
    "source b is further resolved into b1 , the mir - bright nucleus , and b2 , the optical - bright source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : acquisitionimages ] ) .",
    "two other bright mir sources are in the system overlapping region : arp  299-c and arp  299-c@xmath6 .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) luminosity of the system is @xmath7 ( for a distance @xmath8mpc ) , which puts it in the luminous ir galaxy ( lirg ) category .",
    "most of the arp  299 ir luminosity arises from intense star formation ( sf ) activity across the two galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* aah00 and aah09 , hereafter ) . however , there is also evidence of obscured active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity in the galaxy nuclei .",
    "based on hard x - ray observations , the nucleus of ngc  3690/arp  299-b1 was long suspected to have a compton - thick agn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , there is a hot dust continuum associated with an obscured agn that contributes substantially to the nuclear ir emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aah00 , aah09 ) .",
    "although initially thought not to be a seyfert galaxy , @xcite measured seyfert - like optical line ratios for arp  299-b1 .",
    "the case for the presence of an agn in the nuclear region of ic  694/arp  299-a is not as clear .",
    "apart from the tentative x - ray evidence @xcite , perhaps the most convincing argument is the identification of a flat spectral radio source among the large number of compact radio sources detected in the nuclear region of this galaxy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present @xmath0 m spectroscopy of the two nuclei of arp  299 obtained with canaricam ( cc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) .",
    "the gtc / cc high - angular resolution @xmath9 ( @xmath10pc for arp  299 distance ) is approximately a factor of 10 improvement over previous mir spectroscopy of this system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* aah09 ) .",
    "we use the gtc / cc spectroscopy to shed light on the processes giving rise to the deeply nuclear embedded emission in arp  299-a and arp  299-b1 .",
    "we obtained mid - ir high - angular resolution long - slit spectroscopy of the nuclear regions of arp  299 using cc on the gtc .",
    "the observations are part of our gtc / cc agn guaranteed time program ( pi c. telesco ) .",
    "we will use these observations together with an eso / gtc large program ( pi a. alonso - herrero ) to conduct a mir survey of approximately 100 local agn .",
    "we used the low spectral resolution @xmath5 m grating , which covers the @xmath11-band @xmath12 m with nominal @xmath13 .",
    "a 0.52 wide slit was oriented at 345 so that arp  299-b1 and c could be observed simultaneously ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : acquisitionimages ] , right panel ) .",
    "the plate scale of the cc @xmath14 si : as detector is 0.08/pixel , which provides a field of view in imaging mode of @xmath15 .",
    "the observations were taken in queue mode under photometric conditions using the standard mir chop - nod technique on january 29 and june 25 2013 for arp  299-a and arp  299-b1+c , respectively .",
    "first , we obtained an acquisition image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : acquisitionimages ] ) through the si-2 filter ( @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m , 50% cut - on / off ) to ensure optimal placement of the slit .",
    "the on - source integration times for the spectroscopy were 1011s for arp  299-a and 354s for arp  299-b1+c .",
    "we also observed standard stars in imaging and spectroscopic mode to provide the photometric calibration , telluric correction , and slit loss correction .",
    "we used the standard stars and galaxy nuclei to measure an angular resolution at @xmath18 m .",
    "of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( full width half maximum , fwhm ) for arp  299-a and arp  299-b1+c , respectively .",
    "we reduced the data using the cc pipeline redcan @xcite that includes stacking of the individual observations , wavelength calibration , trace determination , spectral extraction , and flux calibration .",
    "the core emission of the two nuclei appears unresolved at the resolution of the gtc / cc acquisition images .",
    "we extracted the 1d nuclear spectra in an optimal way for a point source with the aperture size increasing with wavelength to include all the source flux .",
    "finally , we used the observations of the standard stars to correct for slit losses .",
    "we estimated a 20% total uncertainty of the gtc / cc spectra due to flux calibration and correction for the point source extraction .",
    "[ fig : spectra ]    to compare with the large scale emission ( @xmath21kpc ) , we used spectral mapping observations obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ? * ) on board _ spitzer _ ( see aah09 for full details about the observations ) .",
    "we used cubism @xcite to extract @xmath22 pixel ( @xmath23 ) short - low sl1 ( @xmath24 m ) spectra .",
    "we corrected the spectra for point source emission as in @xcite .",

    ".clumpy torus models for ngc  3690/arp  299-b1 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes. in the clumpy models the torus radial thickness is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the outer radius and @xmath27 is the inner radius .",
    "the gtc / cc nuclear spectrum of ngc  3690 was observed under excellent seeing conditions , @xmath28 .",
    "thus the unresolved mir emission originates from a region of @xmath29pc in size .",
    "the nuclear spectrum shows dust continuum emission likely produced by the obscured agn and a moderately deep @xmath30 m silicate feature .",
    "the apparent depth of the silicate feature , defined as @xmath31 , is @xmath32 .",
    "there is faint nuclear @xmath3 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) with an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath33 m .",
    "the @xmath34 _ spitzer_/irs spectrum shows a composite ( agn / sf ) nature .",
    "it shows 8.6 and @xmath3 m pah features together with a strong continuum due to hot dust ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* aah09 ) .",
    "the ew of the @xmath3 m pah feature measured using a local continuum is @xmath35 m @xcite , which is typical of agn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this agrees with the presence of the unresolved ir - bright source b1 , which has an important hot dust contribution at @xmath36 m based on the observed near - ir co index , possibly associated with an agn . on scales of a few arcseconds ,",
    "b1 is also surrounded by star clusters and bright hii regions ( aah00 ) .",
    "clumpy torus models reproduce satisfactorily the nuclear ir emission of seyfert galaxies and give an estimate of the agn bolometric luminosity @xcite . in this section we model the ir spectral energy distribution ( seds ) and mir spectrum of ngc  3690 to estimate the agn s bolometric luminosity .",
    "we constructed the nuclear ir sed of ngc  3690 with the gtc / cc si-2 @xmath18 m point source measurement of @xmath37mjy and the _ hubble space telescope_/nicmos @xmath38 m non - stellar measurement ( aah00 ) .",
    "we included the keck @xmath39-diameter 3.2 and @xmath40 m @xcite and the kuiper airborne observatory @xmath41 m 8.5-beam flux densities @xcite as upper limit since they are probably contaminated by non - agn emission .",
    "[ fig : bcfitngc3690 ] shows the nuclear ir sed .",
    "we used the @xcite clumpy torus models , also known as clumpy , and the bayesian fitting routine bayesclumpy @xcite to fit the nuclear ir emission of ngc  3690 .",
    "a bayesian approach allows to handle properly the intrinsic degeneracies of the clumpy models , provides probability distributions of the fitted parameters , and allows the use of priors for the torus parameters .",
    "the detection of a nuclear water maser in arp  299-b1 @xcite implies an almost edge - on view of the agn .",
    "we restricted the range of the viewing angles to @xmath42 as a prior .",
    "foreground dust is clearly present in the nuclear region of this galaxy ( see the optical to near - ir color map in figure  9 of aah00 ) .",
    "we set the prior for the foreground extinction to a gaussian distribution centered at 16mag with a 7mag width , based on the estimates of aah00 .",
    "we use the extinction curve of @xcite . for the rest of the clumpy model parameters we used the full range ( see table  [ table : clumpypars ] ) .    the best fit clumpy torus model is shown in fig .  [ fig : bcfitngc3690 ] and the parameters are listed in table  [ table : clumpypars ] .",
    "the fit is achieved with a wide torus , a highly inclined view , and a large number of clouds along the equatorial direction .",
    "this results in a high covering factor of @xmath43 ( see figure  10 in * ? ? ?",
    "the torus extinction along the line of sight of @xmath44mag dominates over the foreground extinction .",
    "the best - fit model to the nuclear ir emission provides an estimate of the agn bolometric luminosity of @xmath45 .",
    "this is about a factor of 10 higher than the @xmath46kev intrinsic luminosity derived for this system with _ bepposax _ with @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "alternatively we can use the hard x - ray vs. @xmath48 m correlation observed for local seyfert galaxies @xcite and the nuclear @xmath48 m monochromatic luminosity .",
    "we predict an intrinsic @xmath49 .",
    "the ratio of observed @xcite to predicted intrinsic @xmath50kev luminosities is of the order of 500 , which would only be compatible with the maximum value of @xmath51 fitted from the _ bepposax _ data @xcite .",
    "both mir estimates of the agn luminosity are higher than _ direct _ measurements , although the highest possible @xmath52 value would produce compatible luminosities .",
    "a possibility would be that the nuclear mir emission had an important contribution from sf .",
    "aah00 estimated that the sf activity in arp  299-b1 is approximately five times less than in arp  299-a . then using the nuclear @xmath48 m fluxes of arp  299-a and arp  299-b1",
    "we predict that sf would only contribute @xmath53 of the observed @xmath48 m nuclear emission from arp  299-b1 .",
    "we would therefore favor the high @xmath52 value rather than a strong contamination from nuclear sf .",
    "finally , it is possible that the hard x - ray vs. mir relation might not be applicable to all compton - thick agn .",
    "the gtc / cc nuclear spectrum of ic  694 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) shows clear pah emission at 8.6 and @xmath3 m indicative of the presence of sf on nuclear scales of @xmath54pc .",
    "this is consistent with results from high angular resolution near - ir ( aah00 ) and radio @xcite observations of this nucleus .",
    "we measured a gtc / cc nuclear ew(@xmath55 m , which is lower than that measured from the kpc - scale _ spitzer_/irs spectrum ( @xmath56 m , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these are typical of galaxies with a composite ( agn / sf ) activity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the decreased nuclear ew with respect to the 1kpc - scale one also indicates a higher relative contribution in the nuclear region from continuum emission , possibly produced by dust heated by the putative agn .",
    "this is similar to findings for nearby seyferts with nuclear sf activity @xcite .",
    "deep silicate features , as in the nuclear spectrum of arp 299-a , can not be reproduced with the clumpy torus models @xcite .",
    "instead , @xcite demonstrated that spherical dusty shell models where the nuclear source is deeply embedded in a smooth distribution of geometrically and optically thick material can produce such deep features .",
    "moreover , the reprocessed emission in these models does not depend on the input spectrum of the heating source .",
    "we obtained the best fit shell model to the gtc / cc spectrum of arp299-a with a total optical depth through the shell of @xmath57 , a maximum temperature at the inside surface of the shell of @xmath58k , @xmath59 ( defined as in table  [ table : clumpypars ] ) , and an @xmath60 density profile .",
    "these are similar to the values obtained for the deep silicate feature observed in the ultraluminous ir galaxy iras  08572 + 3915 @xcite .",
    "while the overall fit to arp  299-a is reasonable , it fails to reproduce the shape of the silicate feature around @xmath61 m ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dustfitic694 ] ) . also , the dusty shell model does not fit the strong nuclear pah emission , as it does not include a star formation component .    alternatively , we fitted the gtc / cc spectrum with a combination of emission and absorption components using the technique described by @xcite .",
    "we first tried a black - body + the orion bar pah spectrum suffering silicate absorption .",
    "this fit is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dustfitic694 ] and has @xmath62 , where @xmath11 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the silicate optical depth is @xmath63 ( @xmath64mag , assuming a dust screen geometry ) with the trapezium silicate grain profile , which is representative of those of molecular clouds . using the curve of",
    "the @xmath65 cephei supergiant gave a poorer fit , but these silicate grains seem to be more appropriate for sources with extremely deep silicate features @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dustfitic694 ]    although these two components provide quite a good qualitative agreement over most of the spectrum , the fit falls below the data points between 9 and @xmath66 m , as found with the dusty shell model fit above . to improve the fit",
    ", we added an ir power - law component ( @xmath67 , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this fills in the @xmath68 m spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dustfitic694 ] ) and improves the fit ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the derived silicate optical depth is @xmath70 or @xmath71mag , in agreement with other ir estimates ( gallais et al .",
    "2004 , aah00 , aah09 ) .",
    "the power - law component contributes approximately 35% of the observed @xmath72 m flux density in the nuclear gtc / cc spectrum of ic  694 .",
    "we propose that this emitting component might be associated with dust heated by the putative agn and also be responsible for the decreased nuclear ew(@xmath3 m pah ) . from the power - law",
    "monochromatic @xmath48 m luminosity we estimated an intrinsic @xmath73 using the @xcite relation , as in section  [ sec : torusfit ] .",
    "the putative agn in ic  694 would be about @xmath74 times less luminous than that in ngc  3690 .",
    "we obtained gtc / cc high - angular resolution ( @xmath9 , @xmath75pc ) mir spectra of the interacting galaxy arp  299 .",
    "we presented evidence of deeply embedded agn activity in both nuclei thanks to the improved angular resolution of these data of almost a factor of 10 with respect to previous mir spectroscopy of this system .",
    "the gtc / cc nuclear spectrum of ngc  3690/arp  299-b1 shows a strong dust continuum with a moderate silicate feature in absorption .",
    "the nuclear @xmath3 m pah feature is weak compared with that in the 1kpc - scale _ spitzer_/irs spectrum .",
    "we fitted the ir emission of ngc  3690 with the clumpy models .",
    "the dust is located in a high covering factor torus and heated by an agn with @xmath76 .",
    "the torus high extinction along the line of sight dominates over the foreground extinction .",
    "the gtc / cc nuclear ( region @xmath54pc in size ) spectrum of ic  694/arp  299-a shows a very deep silicate feature reflecting the highly embedded nature of this source with a fitted @xmath77 ( @xmath71mag , for a dust screen geometry ) .",
    "there is strong nuclear sf based on the detection of the @xmath78 m and @xmath3 m pah features .",
    "the lower ew of the nuclear @xmath3 m pah feature compared with the kpc - scale irs value suggests the presence of a mir continuum that also fills in the silicate feature within @xmath79 m .",
    "if this nuclear continuum emitting component is due to dust heated by an agn , then we estimated an agn luminosity about five times less than that in ngc  3690 .",
    "the interaction of the arp  299 system started at least 750myr ago @xcite but the system has not yet fully merged . the projected nuclear separation is @xmath80kpc and the system is experiencing intense sf spread out over several kpc ( charmandaris et al .",
    "2002 , aah09 ) .",
    "our work provided evidence of dual dust enshrouded agn , probably indicative of an early phase of agn activity .",
    "the combined luminosities of the two agn only account for @xmath53 of the total ir luminosity of the system .",
    "this relatively small agn contribution is typical of local lirgs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations predict that interaction - induced agn activity is common . however , dual agn activity with @xmath81 would only occur simultaneously for approximately 10% of the duration of the interaction ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
