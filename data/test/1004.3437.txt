    "gait analysis plays an important role in exploring laws of human motion by gait parameters via biomechanical methods .",
    "many studies have shown that gait parameters are significantly symmetric @xcite and can be understood in terms of segmental kinematical and kinetic physical quantities , while walking @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , @xcite that by developing gait parameters into evaluation indexes , one can assess the causal relationship between physical injury and gait ability , which in turn has been applied in rehabilitation therapy with success @xcite .",
    "the essence of human center of mass ( com ) motion is actually the periodical change which is under the effect of external forces such as , ground reaction force ( grf ) , gravity and resistance @xcite .",
    "previous studies indicate that the law of com motion is a more reliable gait evaluation method @xcite .",
    "the common features of the frequently - used gait indexes lie in the fact that normal human gait parameters have been regarded as the criteria to evaluate rehabilitation . however , the incomplete symmetry of human shape , coordinate and strength has formed the uniqueness of human gait @xcite . this has brought difficulty to the establishment of standard gait parameter index .",
    "consequently , exploring a principle that is relevant to gait parameters such as cycle time , cadence or stride length in a normal human gait has become essential to the study of gait biomechanics @xcite .",
    "there are a number of issues we wish to explore in our calculation .",
    "an important question is whether the relationships between the grf , velocity of com , average kinetic energy and the time of initial foot contact ( tifc ) in a stride cycle can be established . in particular",
    "we wish to examine if and to what extent such relationships explore the principle behind the gait characteristics . in the present work ,",
    "we wish to advance an attempt towards an approach where the precision of the calculation reaches new levels .    the discovery of many basic principles originated from the study of animal movements @xcite . by examining",
    "the grf acted on the normal human gait ( bare - footed ) , we establish the relationships between the grf , velocity of com , average kinetic energy and the tifc in a stride cycle . in this contribution",
    "we present our recent results on kinetic regularities of com .",
    "another crucial issue in this attempt concerns the prediction of action in gait . using analytic and numerical techniques",
    ", we shall identify the action in gait and explore the possibility of the least - action principle in gait .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows :    in sec .",
    "ii we describe our procedure to establish the relationships between the grf and the tifc and discuss the aspects of determination of the force distribution in anteroposterior , mediolateral and longitudinal directions .",
    "we address the problem of the force distribution in transverse , sagittal and frontal planes and optimization of dispersion of force .",
    "we present a description of the determination of working parameters , such as acceleration , velocity and displacement of com and establish the relationships between the kinetic regularities and the tifc in this section .",
    "we conclude this section by addressing the effect of the tifc upon the average kinetic energy of com .",
    "our main results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "the analysis of com s dynamic characteristics to evaluate the gait features is rather non - trivial .",
    "the inverse dynamic method @xcite has given mixed results with systematic and statistical errors as major sources of uncertainties in the analysis of com dynamics characteristics @xcite .",
    "an attempt to indicate the dynamics characteristics of the whole body com by one particular segment of body will highly underestimate the results .",
    "the target of this work is a calculation that gives more precise estimates of dynamical measurements in question .",
    "we use forward dynamics method @xcite to illustrate on how tifc determines the force distribution and establish a relationship between the tifc and its force dispersion .",
    "since dynamic characteristics of com in gait is governed by kinematics and kinetics of com , therefore , for constant gravity , the analysis of force upon com will compliment the analysis of grf .",
    "also , grf is caused by the body segmental movement driven by the transarticular muscles and eventually by the contact of the foot to the ground , so one foot s grf includes the longitudinal grf , frontal friction and sagittal friction , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the grf of one moment at a stride cycle and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the components in three directions , respectively .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) represent both feet s sagittal and frontal frictions and longitudinal grf , respectively , then the above equation shows a similarity of both feet s grf distribution when expressed in biped gait features @xcite .",
    "consequently , we assume that in each stride cycle , the left and right foot have an identical distribution of grf in all three directions .",
    "this would imply that the grf variations are only caused by the tifc of both feet . setting @xmath8 as one foot s stride cycle time , the initial phase of one foot is equal to zero and that of the other foot @xmath9 ( i.e. tifc ) , then corresponding to one foot s grfs ( for example left foot ) @xmath10 those of the other foot are @xmath11 and eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 1 ] ) becomes @xmath12 since gait is a continuous and periodic movement , therefore while walking at steady speeds , @xmath13 is the grf when tifc is @xmath9 and the stride cycle time is @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 @xmath16 holds , then the grf and gravity @xmath17 in a stride cycle that act on the impulse of com will follow the following equation : @xmath18 to calculate the impulse characteristics of each foot s grf in gait when both feet have same grf , we analyze two phases of one foot s stride cycle .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the stance phase and swing phase , respectively , then in the anterposterior direction , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 - 3 ] ) yield @xmath21 since @xmath22 and @xmath23 , therefore @xmath24 whereas in the mediplateral direction , we get @xmath25 on the other hand , the calculated contribution in the longitudinal direction gives @xmath26 the above equations give the impulse characteristics of each foot s grf in gait .",
    "to analyze the dynamics that emerge in the grf distribution at @xmath27 and @xmath8 , we bring forward the concept of dispersion of grf . if @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the grf dispersions and average values of grf in three direction , then the corresponding correlation between the force dispersion and average grf can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the same as that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 2 ] ) and @xmath33 is the number of @xmath34 within the range @xmath35 $ ] . for sequential values of @xmath36 within the range",
    "@xmath35 $ ] , we calculate the values of @xmath28 and use them to evaluate the effect of tifc upon grf , velocity , position and kinetic energy of com .",
    "we use the average value of grf from @xmath37 subjects to check the reliability and accuracy of this method .",
    "this signature is confirmed in sec .",
    "iii of this study .",
    "ground reaction force is the result of body segments action on the ground via foot and determines the kinetic regularities such as acceleration , velocity and displacement of human body com . knowing the grf and weight , the acceleration of com at a given instant in a stride cycle using eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 2 ] ) can be written as @xmath38 expressing the acceleration of com in component form , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eqn4 - 1 ] ) reveal that the tifc and grf have the same effect on the acceleration of com .",
    "the absolute motion of human com relative to absolute inertia reference frame is composed of convected motion and relative motion .",
    "following kokshenev @xcite , we define gait in accordance with motion in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 3 ] ) , as  walking at steady speeds \" , thus we regard the convected motion a constant parameter . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 1 ] ) at tifc = @xmath9 , the com velocity in a stride cycle is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial velocity of com in relative motion at the beginning of a stride cycle .",
    "it seems that we can not confirm the magnitude of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 2 ] ) by kinetic method ( since everyone s gait speed is different ) .",
    "however , the distinct feature is that once grf and tifc are determined and when it observes the motion in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 3 ] ) , @xmath40 must have a unique solution .",
    "we can then establish the relationship between the initial velocity and acceleration in relative motion in a stride cycle @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 2 ] ) reveals that @xmath43 , which implies that the cycle of velocity of com is in accordance of @xmath44 , that is to say , the end of one stride cycle marks the beginning of the next stride cycle .",
    "this explains the periodical characteristics of velocity of com in gait .",
    "what needs to be further illustrated is that the initial velocity calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 3 ] ) refers that at the beginning of a stride cycle , the body is in the state of steady speeds . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eqn4 - 3 ] ) we conclude that tifc has determined the initial velocity in relative motion , which has nothing to do the convected velocity .",
    "just like the velocity of com , displacement of com also involves absolute , convected and relative displacements .",
    "we define the com initial displacement in relative motion of different tifc as @xmath45 . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 - 2 ] ) , the displacement of com in relative motion at any moment has the following form : @xmath46 and the correlation between the initial displacement of com and velocity of com in relative motion in a stride cycle can be written as @xmath47 similar to the behaviour of the initial velocity in relative motion , we verified that the initial displacement seems to be independent of gait velocity , cadence and stride length .",
    "nature has always minimized certain important quantities when a physical process takes place @xcite .",
    "bipedal walking has enabled the continuous evolution of human gait @xcite and eventually it has brought about the optimized gait @xcite and thus became a behavioral trait . in this behavior , the force , acceleration and velocity all have their minimal values when @xmath48 . to understand the physical significance of these gait dynamic characteristics",
    "we explore the issue of energy consumption . in gait ,",
    "human segment movement is a combination of agonist , antagonist and synergist .",
    "the movements such as stretch or flexure all consume mechanical energy . on the other hand , @xmath49 in com kinetic energy , @xmath50 in total kinetic energy and @xmath51 in average kinetic energy in a stride cycle , whereas the corresponding potential energy counterparts are zero respectively . using the com kinetic energy in relative motion ,",
    "the description of mechanical energy consumption in gait simplifies to @xmath52 and can be easily resolved in component form .",
    "knowing @xmath53 , we can set up the relationships between tifc and com kinetic energy by defining @xmath14 and @xmath9 in the interval @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the experimental measurements were carried on the following set of equipments : simi motion 7.0 three - dimensional movement analysis system ; three kistler @xmath54 @xmath55 force plates ; force plate frequency : @xmath56 , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath57 .",
    "the assembled force plate position has been fixed by gradienter to ensure the force plates are on the same plane .",
    "the measurements are taken at the sample frequency of @xmath58 . before each measurement",
    ", the equipment is examined and returned to zero - position .",
    "twenty female subjects with mean age @xmath59 years , mean height @xmath60 cm and mean weight @xmath61 kg participated in the study .",
    "a few trials of each level gait item were administered to subjects as they ambulated on instrumented positions .",
    "all the patients agreed to participate in the research , and signed freely an informed consent form and study was carried out according to the existing rules and regulations of our institute s ethnic committee . before the test , all the subjects were thoroughly briefed about the procedures and matters needing attention so that they all understand the purpose and the requirements of the test .",
    "each subject s medical history is inquired so as to exclude subjects with diseases such as pathological change , deformity or injury to make sure that their physical conditions would meet the requirements of the test .",
    "when measuring their gaits , we start from the subjects standing position , bare - footed ( both feet disinfected by @xmath62 of ethanol ) .",
    "a pre - test is to guarantee that after they walked three steps , the subjects step on the platform and to make sure that each force plate can measure one foot s stance phase data separately . when the subject s gait is found to be quite abnormal , for example , it is obviously discontinuous , she would be asked to perform again so that the recorded data meet the requirements of the test .",
    "based on the fact that the longitudinal grf in gait is apparently greater than the grfs of the anteroposterior or mediolateral direction , we take the signal of longitudinal grf to identify the instants of initial foot contact and of terminal stance .",
    "the gait we study is walking at steady speeds ; therefore , we de - noise the signals of the platform and examine the test signals would meet the requirements in the predetermined accuracy range .",
    "we rate the gait cycle time by percentage , normalize the weight and standardize the grf from three directions .",
    "we count on average of the processed data of 20 subjects three - direction grf from individual stride cycle to conduct our research .",
    "to explore the spatial grf , we examine eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 - 2 ] ) by using the grf numeric of @xmath37 subjects . fig . [ fig1 ] collects and displays the results of anterposterior , mediolateral and longitudinal grf .",
    "the grf has been standardized ( @xmath63 ) and stride cycle time is rated by percentage .",
    "[ fig1]a - c shows that tifc has an effect upon the grf in three directions . using three sets of component data from grf of the subject s gait , we obtained curved surface effective plots and the quantitative relationship between tifc and grf resultant forces on three planes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     when tifc falls at the @xmath64 and @xmath65 of a stride cycle , the kinetic energy of com in three planes varies rather considerably . on the transverse and frontal planes ,",
    "the effect is similar whereas the sagittal plane undergoes a non - trivial change .",
    "we apply the dispersion of kinetic energy of com to evaluate this effect .",
    "we notice , from fig .",
    "[ fig5]j , that com average kinetic energy is minimum at @xmath48 , which implies a minima for the com mechanical energy consumption and signatures the physical significance of gait .",
    "the intriguing question that arises from the above discussion if there is a symmetry or a physical principle that is hidden in the phenomenon that makes the com kinetic energy to reach its extremum at @xmath48 . in order to explore this issue",
    ", we pursue the technique of optimizing the dispersion objective function @xcite @xmath66 the action of grf and gravity are the reasons for human com motion changes .",
    "let s first analyze the grf .",
    "the average value of the resultant force in the anteroposterior and mediolateral direction @xmath67 and @xmath68 is zero and in the longitudinal direction @xmath69 is one ( when the weight has been normalized ) .",
    "therefore , for a known gait , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are all constants and eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 - 2 ] ) simplifies the dispersion optimization to @xmath72 to find a solution of the optimization problem , we need to set up a function of grf that changes with time in three directions .",
    "it seems that the pulse periodic grf fits the criteria and hence we use segment trigonometric functions @xmath73 where @xmath74 stand for the grf after normalization in three directions and @xmath19 is the stance time . for a small enough test frequency ,",
    "the above equation transforms to @xmath75 let s take longitudinal grf in eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 - 5 ] ) as an example .",
    "in order to get the antiderivative of the integrand of integral variable @xmath14 , we detach @xmath14 and @xmath9 of trigonometric function to obtain @xmath76 now we can transform eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 - 6 ] ) into the integral of integral variable @xmath14 while regarding the grf as segment function .",
    "the transformation reduces the pulse periodic grf functions into three piecewise functions at three intervals and @xmath77 . ] : @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 $ ] and @xmath80 $ ] which , to the confirmed grf , @xmath74 are constants and @xmath81 ( related to @xmath74 ) are also constants , yields the following form of longitudinal grf : @xmath82 the contribution @xmath83 in the interval @xmath78 $ ] , thus giving the @xmath84 , which in turn yield ( from eq . ( [ eqn5 - 7 ] ) ) a maxima ( @xmath85 ) . on the other hand , the contribution @xmath86 in @xmath79 $ ] giving the solution @xmath87 which yields @xmath88 ( a minima ) .",
    "similarly , we obtain a maximum value @xmath89 in @xmath80 $ ] .    following the above procedure , it is easy to verify ( from eq .",
    "[ eqn5 - 5 ] ) that at @xmath90 the dispersion of grf in the anteroposterior direction attains a minima of @xmath91 and a maxima of @xmath92 .",
    "in the mediolateral direction . since , in gait , @xmath93 , the sum of dispersions in three directions is minimal at @xmath48 .",
    "this confirms our results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]d - f and [ fig5]j .",
    "similarly , the dispersion of com acceleration , dispersion of com velocity and the com mechanical energy consumption are all the minimal at @xmath48 .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of the physiological factors such as height , weight and gait parameters @xcite .",
    "in periodic motion , the foot s stance and swing substitute one another such that one foot always remains in stance . this allows the human body to be acted by the periodical grf , which is related not only to the foot s movement style , but also to the substitution style of one foot with another . following the biped movement style in normal gaits and the similar traits of grf ,",
    "we have been able to study the effect of tifc upon the human com dynamic characteristics based on the assumption that both feet s grfs are the same in the same phase .",
    "our results suggest that when tifc falls in the middle of the other foot s stride cycle , the com kinematics and dispersions of grf acted on com are the minimal , which has entailed the minimal average mec of muscles .",
    "our analysis suggests that it falls into the category of least - action principle and is consistent with the phenomenon that exists in normal gaits @xcite .    based upon the least - action principle",
    ", we have observed that tifc has caused the grf and the com regularities to form a closed - curve on the transverse and frontal plane , which might present a new method for gait evaluation .",
    "we advocate the use of this method to uncover and speed up the diagnosis simply by measuring the grf for the patients with foot injuries or arthritis ( for such patients , the model for these quantities is not symmetric @xcite ) . meanwhile ,",
    "the patients need only walk a few steps in their normal gait , their com dynamic characteristics will be acquired easily and more accurately .",
    "this is exactly what the clinic diagnosis is looking for .",
    "in addition to the human gait s adaptation to natural environment @xcite , the evolution of gait is the result of its observation of least - action principle .",
    "we believe that precise measurements of the variations of shear stress in natural gaits ( bare - footed ) shall profoundly enriched the content of least - action principle @xcite . a further study of least - action principle will be significant to the domains such as sport rehabilitation , biometric identification @xcite and control of biped robot gaits @xcite .",
