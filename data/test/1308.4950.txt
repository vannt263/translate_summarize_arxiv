    "mathematical modeling is a prominent tool used to better understand complex mechanical or biological systems @xcite .",
    "a common problem that arises when developing a model of a biological or mechanical system is that some of its parameters are unknown .",
    "this is especially important when those parameters have special meaning but can not be directly measured .",
    "thus a natural question arises : can all , or at least some , of the model s parameters be estimated indirectly and _ uniquely _ from observations of the system s input and output ?",
    "this is the question of _ structural identifiability_. sometimes the uniqueness holds only within a certain range . in this case , we say that a system is only _ locally _ structurally identifiable .",
    "there are numerous reasons why one would be interested in establishing identifiability .",
    "structural identifiability is a necessary condition for the practical or numerical identifiability problem , which involves parameter estimation with real , and often noisy , data .",
    "the unobservable biologically meaningful parameters of a model can only be determined ( or approximated ) if the model is structurally identifiable .",
    "moreover , optimization schemes can not be employed reliably since they will find difficulties when trying to estimate unidentifiable parameters @xcite .",
    "the concept of structural identifiability was introduced for the first time in the work of bellman and strm @xcite . since then",
    ", numerous techniques have been developed to analyze the identifiability of linear and nonlinear systems with and without controls @xcite ; see also @xcite for a review of different approaches .",
    "viscoelastic mechanical models that utilize springs and dashpots in various configurations have been widely used in numerous areas of research including material sciences @xcite , computer graphics @xcite , and biomedical engineering to describe mechanical properties of biological systems @xcite . to achieve a desirable response , networks with different numbers of springs and dashpots in various configurations have been constructed .",
    "for example , it is well - known that the simplest models of viscoelastic materials such as voigt ( spring and dashpot in parallel ) or maxwell ( spring and dashpot in series ) do not offer satisfactory representation of the nature of real materials @xcite .",
    "thus more complicated configurations are usually constructed and analyzed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the identifiability problem of viscoelastic models represented by an arbitrarily complex spring - dashpot network .",
    "although there exist numerous methods that can determine the type of identifiability of a system of ordinary differential equations , generally they are difficult to apply",
    ". our results will show in a remarkably simple way how to verify whether the studied model is ( locally or globally ) structurally identifiable . in case",
    "it is unidentifiable , our method provides an explanation why this is the case and how to reformulate the problem .",
    "moreover , the existing methods usually allow to establish the identifiability only _ a posteriori _ , i.e.  after concrete systems have been established",
    "thus , we also introduce `` identifiability tables '' , which allow not only to check but also to construct an arbitrarily complex _",

    "it is well - known that the stress - strain curves of the artery walls exhibit hysteresis , which is understood to be a consequence of the fact that the wall is viscoelastic .",
    "another manifestation of the viscoelasticity of the arterial tissue is the stress relaxation experiments under constant stretch ( strain ) .",
    "spring - dashpot ( s - d ) networks are often used in order to describe the biomechanical properties of the arterial tissue @xcite .",

    "_ it is common to use the spring - dashpot network to describe the neural firing of various sensors ( e.g.  muscle spindle , baroreceptors ) , see @xcite .",
    "typically one assumes that the firing activity is proportional to the strain sensed by a spring connected in series with a spring - dashpot network , which represents a local integration of the nerve endings to the arterial wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] ) . then the arterial wall and neural activity models are combined . although separately each model is structurally identifiable , there is no guarantee that the resulting viscoelastic structure is identifiable .",
    "thus , using our results given in theorem [ thm : localmt ] , we can establish whether the combined viscoelastic model is identifiable , and if not , what needs to be modified .",
    "after reviewing basic concepts of viscoelasticity of systems , we present and discuss our main results related to local and global structural identifiability of such systems .",
    "finally , we illustrate our results with a number of examples from the literature .",
    "the ideal linear elastic material follows hooke s law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a young s modulus ( or a spring constant ) , which describes the relationship between the stress @xmath2 and the strain @xmath3 .",
    "analogously , the relation @xmath4 describes the viscous material , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a viscous constant @xcite . in the basic linear viscoelasticity theory ,",
    "the elastic and viscous elements are combined . in this work ,",
    "we shall be concerned with the problem of identifiability of networks of springs and dashpots that are essentially one - dimensional .",
    "the elements can be combined either in series or in parallel . in order to obtain the relationship between the total stress ( force ) @xmath2 and the total strain ( extension ) @xmath3 for a given spring - dashpot network , we use two fundamental rules . for two viscoelastic elements connected in series ,",
    "the stress is the same in both elements , but the total strain is the sum of individual strains on each element . on the other hand , for elements connected in parallel",
    ", the strain is the same for both elements , but the total stress is the sum of individual stresses on each element .",
    "now we consider concrete viscoelastic networks , starting with the simplest configurations .",
    "[ ex : m ] the series combination of a spring , denoted by its constant @xmath1 , and a dashpot , denoted by its constant @xmath6 , is known as a maxwell element ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : simple](a ) ) . since the elements are connected in series , the stress @xmath2 is the same on both elements and the total strain @xmath3 is the sum of strains @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to the spring and dashpot , respectively .",
    "now , the relationship between the total strain and stress for this system is @xmath9    [ ex : v ] another simple example is the voigt element ( also known as kelvin or kelvin - voigt ) given in fig .",

    "note that the stress @xmath2 is the same on all three elements connected in series ( voigt , spring and dashpot ) .",

    "examples [ ex : m ] , [ ex : v ] , and [ ex : burgers ] ) that for any configuration of springs @xmath15 and dashpots @xmath16 , the total strain  stress relationship can always be written as the following @xmath17-st order linear ordinary differential equation @xmath18 where the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions of the spring and dashpot constants .",
    "the precise value of @xmath21 and the forms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 will depend on the particular structure of the spring - dashpot model .",
    "equation [ eq : ode ] is known as the _ constitutive equation_. in the context of spring - dashpot networks , identifiability concerns whether or not it is possible to recover the unknown parameters ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) of the system from the governing equation of the model , given only the total stress @xmath2 and total strain @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", we assume that we know the stress and the strain at the bounding nodes only and ask if it is possible to determine the unknown parameters ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . in order to uniquely fix the coefficients of the constitutive equation",
    ", we require that be _",
    "normalized _ so that the leading term ( in @xmath2 or @xmath3 , depending on the situation ) is monic . thus , letting the @xmath26 non - monic coefficients of be represented by the vector @xmath27 , we have the following formal definition of identifiability .",
    "[ defn : id ] let @xmath28 be a function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the parameter space .",
    "the model is _ globally identifiable _ from @xmath28 if and only if the map @xmath28 is one - to - one .",
    "the model is _ locally identifiable _ from @xmath28 if and only if the map @xmath28 is finite - to - one .",
    "the model is _ unidentifiable _ from @xmath28 if and only if the map @xmath28 is infinite - to - one .",
    "note that local identifiability is equivalent to saying that around each point in parameter space there exists a neighborhood on which the function @xmath28 is one - to - one .",
    "for example , for the burgers model considered in example [ ex : burgers ] , the coefficient function @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 technically speaking , in this paper we will consider the slightly weaker notion of _ generic global identifiability _ ( or generic local identifiability , or generic unidentifiability ) , where _ generic _ means that the property holds almost everywhere .",
    "we will omit the use of the term generic when speaking of identifiability .    definition [ defn : id ] implies that if there are more parameters than non - monic coefficients , then the system must be unidentifiable .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for structural identifiability is that the number of parameters @xmath33 ( elements of the network ) is less than or equal to the number of non - monic coefficients in the constitutive equation .",
    "we will soon show that the number of non - monic coefficients is bounded by the number of parameters in spring - dashpot networks .",
    "thus , in this case , a necessary condition for structural identifiability is that the number of parameters and non - monic coefficients are equal .",
    "we will prove that , remarkably , in the case of viscoelastic models represented by a spring - dashpot network , the converse to this statement holds as well .",
    "[ local identifiability ] [ thm : parameqcoeff ] a viscoelastic model represented by a spring - dashpot network is locally identifiable if and only if the number of non - monic coefficients of the corresponding constitutive equation equals the total number of its moduli @xmath34 and viscosity parameters @xmath35 .",
    "note that although the constitutive equation is a linear differential equation , its coefficients considered as functions of spring and viscous constants are not linear functions of the parameters ( see ) .",
    "thus , theorem [ thm : parameqcoeff ] allows to reduce the difficult problem of checking one - to - one or finite - to - one behavior of nonlinear functions to simply counting the number of parameters ( springs and dashpots ) and non - monic coefficients of the constitutive equation and asking whether the two numbers are equal .",
    "the positive answer implies local identifiability , whereas a negative answer implies unidentifiability .",
    "consider , for example , the maxwell and voigt elements , and the burgers model .",
    "we note that the constitutive equations , , and for all three models are already in the normalized form .",
    "now , simply by counting the number of parameters and the non - monic coefficients of the constitutive equations , we see that the two are equal for each model .",
    "thus , by the above theorem , all three models are locally structurally identifiable .",
    "now we examine when combining two identifiable models results also in an identifiable model .",
    "this will allow us to construct arbitrarily complex and identifiable spring - dashpot networks .",
    "we start with an observation , which we prove in the following section , related to the possible form of any differential equation that describes a spring - dashpot network .    [",
    "prop : types ] every spring - dashpot network , given by equation , has one of the four possible types @xmath36    recall that @xmath21 is the highest derivative of the stress component @xmath37 , which appears in the total strain - stress equation .",
    "now we illustrate the different types of networks defined in the above proposition by considering the simplest elements .    for a spring , given by @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 ( only @xmath2 appears in the constitutive equation , but none of its derivatives ) , @xmath40 , and @xmath41",
    ". therefore a spring is of type a. note that for a dashpot , which is given by @xmath42 , we also have @xmath39 but @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus , according to notation given in proposition [ prop : types ] , a dashpot is of type b. for the voigt element , given by , we have @xmath39 as well as @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( that is @xmath47 ) .",
    "we conclude that it is of type c. finally , a maxwell element is given by .",
    "note that here @xmath48 ( since @xmath49 appears in ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "thus a maxwell element is of type d.    once the constitutive equation has been determined for a given spring - dashpot network , it is very easy to establish the type that it belongs to .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath21 does not always have a physical significance .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is determined by the specific network and can not be easily related to the number of springs and dashpots as we will illustrate later on .",
    "[ thm : localmt ] consider two locally identifiable spring - dashpot systems @xmath53 and @xmath54 of one of the four types @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "there are several ways one could use the above theorem .",
    "one way is to establish the local identifiability of a given spring - dashpot network .",
    "contrary to our similar result given in theorem [ thm : parameqcoeff ] , this can be done without actually calculating the constitutive equation .",

    "now we complete the presentation and discussion of our results by introducing a criterium , which establishes when a given network is _ globally _ structurally identifiable .",
    "[ thm : global ] a viscoelastic model represented by a spring - dashpot network is globally identifiable if and only if it is locally identifiable and the network is constructed by adding either in parallel or in series at the bounding nodes exactly one basic element ( spring or dashpot ) at a time .    note that the network given in fig .",

    "thus the system is only locally , but not globally , identifiable .",
    "however , in this case the non - global identifiability arises from merely permuting the parameters among the three voigt elements .",
    "in this section , we prove the main results from the previous section . to do this",
