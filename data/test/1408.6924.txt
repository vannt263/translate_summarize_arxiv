    "as mobile broadband wireless networks evolve , increasingly ambitious targets have been set for spectral efficiency . exploiting the capabilities of multiple antennas at the mobiles and",
    "base transceiver station ( bts ) is crucial to meet those goals .",
    "an effective approach is to use spatial precoding at the transmitters and filtering at receivers to adapt to the variations of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channel and interference conditions by optimizing a metric such as the sum rate , signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) , or mean squared error ( mse ) .",
    "two challenges need to be addressed : first , the precoders and filters should be _ jointly _ optimized ; and second , the optimization should be carried out without _ a priori _ knowledge of the channel and interference conditions .",
    "while joint optimization of precoders and receivers in cellular networks has attracted considerable attention in recent years ( e.g. , @xcite ) , much of the work has assumed linear precoders for the downlink , and has considered channel estimation methods for estimating those precoders with unknown channels .",
    "here we consider joint optimization and adaptation of _ non_linear precoders and receivers .",
    "specifically , we assume that the users are successively decoded and cancelled at the bts for the uplink , and that successive interference pre - cancellation with tomlinson - harashima precoding is applied by the bts for the downlink .",
    "the mobiles use linear filtering and precoding . a time - division duplex",
    "( tdd ) network is assumed in order to exploit the reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels .",
    "the precoder and receiver filters are optimized according to a sum - mse criterion assuming mimo fading channels .",
    "this criterion is motivated by previous results showing that the minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) receiver with successive interference cancellation achieves the sum capacity of the multiaccess channel @xcite , and that the precoding structure considered ( generalized decision - feedback equalizer with interference pre - compensation ) achieves the sum capacity of the gaussian broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mse criterion leads directly to adaptive approaches for filter estimation in the presence of unknown channels and interference .    for a single cell",
    "we first show that alternating optimization of precoders and receiver filters ( for either the uplink or downlink ) converges to a local optimum .",
    "although this optimization must be applied separately for the uplink and downlink to obtain the optimal precoders and receiver filters for each direction , we observe that the filters optimized for one direction achieve near - optimal performance for the other direction as well when the uplink and downlink power constraints and noise power are similar . with this in mind we consider a simplified scheme in which the uplink ( downlink ) receive filters",
    "are also used as downlink ( uplink ) precoders . with this constraint",
    "we again show that alternating optimization of the filters at the bts and mobiles converges to a fixed point .    in the absence of channel state information ( csi )",
    "the preceding results lead to an iterative bi - directional training scheme in which uplink and downlink pilots are alternately transmitted to estimate the bts and mobile filters , respectively .",
    "the estimated bts forward / backward filters then nonlinearly precode both the downlink data and pilots for interference pre - cancellation , and the estimated mobile receiver filters precode both the uplink data and pilots . with sufficient training , the estimated filters approach the corresponding mmse filters in which case training in each direction corresponds to an mmse update of the corresponding filters .",
    "these uplink / downlink updates are then iterated until convergence , or a complexity constraint is reached .",
    "this scheme extends the bi - directional training scheme presented in @xcite , where the uplink / downlink pilots are used to estimate linear filters / precoders without interference cancellation .",
    "a key feature of these schemes is that the pilots are transmitted _ synchronously _ in each direction ( across all cells ) , and are used to estimate the filters _",
    "directly _ via a least squares criterion , rather than directly estimating the channel .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this scheme is _ distributed _ in the sense that each node ( bts or mobile ) autonomously computes its own filters from the received signal and pilots .",
    "in contrast , prior schemes for precoding / filtering based on channel estimation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) are more suitable for centralized optimization in which all csi for direct- and cross - channels is passed to a single remote location , which computes all filters and then passes those back to the corresponding nodes .",
    "numerical results are presented that illustrate the performance of the bi - directional training scheme as a function of the amount of training and number of forward - backward iterations .",
    "it is shown that the achievable rate with nonlinear filters approaches the uplink sum capacity as the number of iterations increases . for a fixed number of training symbols ,",
    "the nonlinear filters significantly outperform linear filters when the number of iterations is limited even though the nonlinear filters require more parameters to be estimated .",
    "an example for a multi - cell scenario shows that more iterations are required for the precoders and receive filters to converge than for a single cell .",
    "nonlinear filters again significantly outperform linear filters with few iterations in the high - snr regime .",
    "related work on joint precoder and receive filter design has been presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "iterative algorithms are proposed for simultaneous diagonalization of the downlink multiuser channels to enable interference - free spatial - division multiplexing . in @xcite , algorithms are presented to jointly optimize linear filters and precoders for the uplink using a sum - mse criterion .",
    "mse duality results for broadcast and multiaccess channels are presented in @xcite .",
    "duality ensures that any uplink minimum mse scheme has a downlink counterpart . in @xcite ,",
    "the downlink sum - mse minimization problem is solved by creating a `` virtual '' uplink channel , which has the same transmit power and noise level as for the actual downlink channel .",
    "however , those methods can not be implemented in a distributed manner in the setting of this paper , where the uplink and downlink channels may have different power constraints and noise levels . in @xcite , iterative mmse beamforming algorithms",
    "are presented to minimize the sum power subject to a set of sinr constraints , where the precoder and receive filter updates are done sequentially across users .",
    "in contrast , all users update simultaneously in this paper .",
    "consider a single cell consisting of a bts with @xmath0 antennas and @xmath1 users , where user @xmath2 has @xmath3 antennas .",
    "the uplink channel between user @xmath2 and the bts is denoted by @xmath4 of size @xmath5 , each entry of which is a unit - variance circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable .",
    "each user is restricted to one data stream , although the algorithms to be presented are easily extended to the scenario with multiple data streams per user .",
    "the received signal vector at the bts is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the data symbol from user @xmath2 and @xmath8\\!=\\!1 $ ] , @xmath9 is the @xmath10 precoder with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the power constraint for user @xmath2 , and @xmath13 is the cscg noise vector each entry of which has zero mean and variance @xmath14 .    similarly , assuming tdd with channel reciprocity ,",
    "the downlink received signal at user @xmath2 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the data symbol for user @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the corresponding transmit beam , and @xmath19 denotes the cscg noise vector with @xmath2th entry having variance @xmath20 .",
    "the filters satisfy the bts power constraint @xmath21 .",
    "we first discuss joint optimization of transmit precoders and receive filters at a central controller with perfect csi .",
    "adaptive versions with training are subsequently discussed in section  [ s : training ] .",
    "first consider the case where the received signal in ( [ upsignal ] ) is processed by linear filters @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 denotes the receive filter for user @xmath2",
    ". the estimated signal for user @xmath2 is given by @xmath24 and the corresponding mse for user @xmath2 is @xmath25\\\\ & \\!=\\!1\\!+\\!\\sigma^2\\|\\boldsymbol{g}_k\\|^2\\!-\\!2\\re\\big\\{\\boldsymbol{g}_k^\\dagger\\boldsymbol{h}_k\\boldsymbol{v}_k\\big\\}\\!+\\!\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\big|\\boldsymbol{g}_k^\\dagger\\boldsymbol{h}_i\\boldsymbol{v}_i\\big|^2,\\label{upmse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 takes the real part of a complex number .",
    "the optimization problem is stated as :    [ upproblem ] @xmath27    [ prop : fullpow ] the sum mmse is minimized when all users transmit with full power .    the proof is given in the appendix .",
    "hence the decrease in sum mse for a particular user @xmath2 due to an increase in power @xmath12 dominates the increase in sum mse due to the increase in interference at neighboring receivers .",
    "we will assume that each user transmits at the maximum power so that the constraints ( [ powercon ] ) are binding .",
    "the lagrangian for problem  ( [ upproblem ] ) is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the power constraint for user @xmath2 .",
    "hence the optimal solution to problem ( [ upproblem ] ) must satisfy : @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath29 in ( [ eq : uplnfilter2 ] ) is chosen to satisfy ( [ powercon ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear successive cancellation filter at the bts is the decision - feedback detector ( dfd ) shown in fig .",
    "[ uplink ] .",
    "the received signal is input to the linear feedforward filter @xmath32 , and the feedback filter @xmath33 implements the successive interference cancellation . assuming the decoding order is from user @xmath34 to user @xmath1 , the feedback matrix @xmath35 is lower triangular with diagonal elements equal to one .",
    "the estimated symbol for user @xmath2 is then @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the ( @xmath2,@xmath17)-th element of @xmath35 and @xmath38 denotes the slicer function in the forward loop . for user",
    "@xmath2 , if decoding of the previous symbols is correct , i.e. , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , then the interference from users 1 to user @xmath41 can be removed .",
    "the achievable mse for user @xmath2 is then @xmath42 the problem becomes    [ dfeproblem ] @xmath43    in this scenario it may not be optimal ( in the sum - mse sense ) for all users to transmit with full power .",
    "we will nevertheless assume that the power constraints are binding since this simplifies the problem , and because transmitting at full power is known to achieve the uplink sum capacity .",
    "writing the lagrangian as before , the corresponding first - order conditions are @xmath44 for @xmath31 , where the lagrange multipliers @xmath29 s are chosen to enforce the power constraints ( [ con : fullpow ] ) .",
    "the summation indices differ from ( [ eq : uplnfilter1 ] ) and ( [ eq : uplnfilter2 ] ) due to successive cancellation .",
    "the expressions for the downlink filters can be obtained in a similar fashion as for the uplink .",
    "the uplink and downlink problems are different because the snrs for the uplink and downlink channels are different in general , and because the power constraints are on individual users in the uplink , while the constraint is on the sum over all users in the downlink . for the downlink ,",
    "the estimated symbol for user @xmath2 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the receiver filter .",
    "the corresponding mse is @xmath47 the downlink sum - mse minimization problem is    [ dproblem ] @xmath48    the corresponding optimal filters satisfy : @xmath49 for @xmath31 , where the lagrange multiplier @xmath50 is chosen to satisfy .    with nonlinear filtering at the bts @xcite , i.e. , dirty paper coding , assuming",
    "the encoding order is from user @xmath1 to user @xmath34 , the signal received by user @xmath2 can be written as @xmath51 the corresponding mse for user @xmath2 at the output of the linear receiver @xmath46 is then @xmath52 the downlink sum - mse minimization problem is    [ dproblem_ipc ] @xmath53    the corresponding optimal filters satisfy : @xmath54 for @xmath31 , where the lagrange multiplier @xmath50 is chosen to satisfy .",
    "focusing on the uplink the precoders and filters in ( [ eq : uplnfilter1])([eq : uplnfilter2 ] ) are coupled , evading an explicit solution in terms of the channels only .",
    "moreover , problem   is non - convex when @xmath55 , thus there is no known efficient numerical algorithm for finding the global optimum . , or",
    "if @xmath55 and there is no constraint on the number of data streams per user , then this problem can be transformed into a convex program  @xcite . ]",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the precoders and filters can be computed iteratively . with fixed transmit precoders @xmath56 ,",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) is strictly convex in receive filters @xmath57 , and ( [ eq : uplnfilter1 ] ) gives the optimal solution .",
    "conversely , with fixed @xmath57 , we compute @xmath56 and @xmath58 together from   with the requirement that @xmath59 for every @xmath2 . the search for",
    "each @xmath29 can be efficient because the optimization of @xmath60 is decoupled across users .    because @xmath29 is chosen to guarantee @xmath61 , the lagrangian in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is always equal to the sum - mse .",
    "thus the lagrangian as well as the sum - mse monotonically decrease with each update , and must converge since they are lower bounded by zero . in case multiple @xmath29 s enforce @xmath59 , we choose the one that yields the minimum lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "if multiple @xmath29 s achieve the same minimum , then we can randomly choose one . since the preceding procedure dictates a one - to - one mapping between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , it is not difficult to show that the set of precoders and filters @xmath62 must also converge to a fixed point .",
    "the fixed point must be a local optimum for problem ( [ upproblem ] ) , although it may not be globally optimal .",
    "similar to the linear case , the iterative approach previously described can also be applied to compute ( [ eq : upnlnfilter1])([eq : upnlnfilter2 ] ) and the convergence of the filters follows from the monotonic decrease of the lagrangian and the one - to - one mapping between the precoders and the receiver filters . for the downlink",
    "the set of linear filters can be computed by iterating ( [ eq : downlnfilter1 ] ) and ( [ eq : downlnfilter2 ] ) , and the set of nonlinear filters can be computed by iterating ( [ eq : downnlnfilter2 ] ) and ( [ eq : downnlnfilter1 ] ) . according to similar arguments as for the uplink , all the filters will again converge to a fixed point .",
    "the iterative optimization procedure in section  [ sec : iterativeseparate ] was applied separately to compute the set of uplink filters , given by a solution to ( [ upproblem ] ) , and the set of downlink filters , given by a solution to ( [ dproblem ] ) . here",
    "we present a suboptimal iterative algorithm that computes all uplink / downlink precoders and filters simultaneously .",
    "numerical results show that the performance of this algorithm is very close to that of separate uplink and downlink optimizations with practically relevant snrs .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the uplink precoders and receive filters as in section  [ sec : linearup ] , and let @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the downlink precoders and receive filters .",
    "taking linear filters as an example , we apply the following four steps in each iteration :    1 .",

    "4 .   compute @xmath72 .",
    "that is , we use the same update formulas as for the uplink and downlink optimizations discussed in section  [ sec : linearup ] , but constrain the precoders and receive filters at each terminal to be the same .",
    "the uplink and downlink powers @xmath73 and @xmath74 are assumed to be given _",
    "a priori_. this assumption is needed to prove the following convergence result , but will be relaxed in the next section .    for any fixed positive @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    ", the precoders and filters @xmath75 computed according to the preceding iterative algorithm converge to a fixed point as the number of iterations goes to infinity .",
    "we provide a positive potential function of the precoders and filters and show that this function decreases every iteration .",

    "the mapping from @xmath56 to @xmath57 or from @xmath86 to @xmath87 is unique , it is easy to show that the filters must converge to a fixed point .    with similar arguments this proposition can be extended to nonlinear filters and to interference networks with multiple users and multiple cells . in the case of interference networks",
    ", the potential function can be chosen as the the sum of the achievable mse s plus the scaled norms of the precoders at all transmitters .    ideally , the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are such that the transmit power constraints at the bts and mobiles are satisfied at convergence .",
    "the values are of course unknown _ a priori_. a straightforward power scaling method is to normalize the precoders directly after each iteration so that the transmit power constraint is met .",
    "this is analogous to the max - sinr algorithm proposed in @xcite for interference networks .",
    "although we can not prove the convergence of the corresponding optimization algorithm , convergence has always been observed for numerical examples .",
    "in fact the performance of this algorithm is very close to that of separate optimization of the uplink problem   and its downlink counterpart .",
    "in this section , we assume the channels are unknown to the bts and mobiles _ a priori_. we propose a bi - directional training scheme for adapting the precoders at the mobiles and the filters at the bts with the goal of minimizing the uplink sum - mse .",
    "this bi - directional training scheme can be implemented in a distributed manner .",
    "specifically , estimates of ( [ eq : uplnfilter1 ] ) and ( [ eq : upnlnfilter1 ] ) can be obtained by training in the uplink , and estimates of ( [ eq : uplnfilter2 ] ) and ( [ eq : upnlnfilter2 ] ) can be obtained by training in the downlink . a similar scheme can be applied to the downlink ; since the uplink and downlink problems are similar , we focus on the uplink in this section .",
