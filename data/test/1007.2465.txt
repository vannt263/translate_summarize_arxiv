    "glueballs , being composed of pure gluons in the limit of no quark fields , have attracted much attention since the theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , was founded in the late of 1970s @xcite .",
    "estimates of glueball properties were obtained in a variety of approaches @xcite , ranging from model analyses @xcite , quenched lattice qcd ( qlqcd)@xcite and unquenched lattice qcd ( uqlqcd ) simulations @xcite to qcd sum rule calculations @xcite .",
    "the lowest @xmath0 scalar glueball state is , in fact , the most intricate hadron state which is difficult to figure out . in lattice qcd ( lqcd )",
    "the mass scale of the scalar glueball is predicted to be in the rang of 1.3 - 1.7 gev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 scalar resonances closest to this energy range are @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the present data @xcite , and some authors favor the former as the lightest scalar glueball @xcite , while some others prefer the latter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 may not be pure glueballs ; to the contrary , these resonances can be considered to be the mixture of glueball and mesons @xcite . in the qcd sum rule approach ,",
    "the results of the mass of the scalar glueball are also different from each other . in the early days of qcd",
    ", some found a light @xmath0 scalar glueball in the region of @xmath3-@xmath4 mev @xcite using the subtracted sum rule ( ssr ) , while the others obtained a much heavier one in the @xmath5-@xmath6 gev region @xcite by using the unsubtracted sum rule ( ussr ) .",
    "the inconsistency between both subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules has bothered scientists for many years .",
    "it should be noticed that , in the early qcd sum rule approach , it was already recognized that there is an onset of the nonperturbative physics ( a departure from the asymptotic freedom ) in the scalar glueball correlator at unusually short distances @xmath7 @xcite . such hard",
    "nonperturbative effects are usually considered to be coming from direct instantons , i.e. the tunneling processes which rearrange the qcd vacuum topology in localized regions@xcite .",
    "this physics was ignored in the early glueball sum rules except in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , a sizeable instanton contribution to the qcd sum rules of the @xmath0 scalar glueball has been found on the basis of the instanton liquid model of the qcd vacuum @xcite , and supported by the lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the instanton - induced continuum contributions are neglected in the early qcd sum rule approach , and thus a reliable estimate of the glueball properties can not be obtained .",
    "on the basis of the instanton - improved operator - product expansion ( ope ) , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite included the instanton - induced contributions to the continuum spectrum , made a great improvement to the consistency between different types of @xmath0 scalar glueball sum rules , and gave new predictions for the mass and decay constant confirmed later by the gaussian sum rule ( gsr ) calculation @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have clarified that the stability and the consistency for the ssr and ussrs for the @xmath0 scalar glueball can be obtained by using a systematical semiclassical expansion of the background instanton fields in the instanton liquid model of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "instantons , which make a great difference in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels @xcite , play a major role in the gluonic interactions , especially in the nonperturbative region @xcite .",
    "direct instanton contributions are included in the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the results are found to be in good agreement with different ussrs .",
    "the compatibility between the ssr and ussrs become much better but are not satisfying yet , because only the leading classic effects are included in most of the calculations with the perturbative contribution and condensate contributions .",
    "it should be noted that the direct - instanton approximation is criticized due to the problem of double counting @xcite , because both condensate and instanton contributions are included in the correlator , but most of the gluon condensates could be produced from instantons .    up to now ,",
    "most of the theoretical calculations for the @xmath0 scalar glueball were based on qcd laplace sum rules ( lsr ) , which emphasize the contributions of the lowest resonance , and have shown the power in the investigation of the nonperturbative properties of the hadron ground states . on the other hand , it should be noticed that the gsr developed later emphasizes only the contribution of the state considered , and has a cleaner background in comparison with the lsr . as a cross - check",
    ", the same problem should be investigated using gsr , because both laplace and gaussian sum rules are derived from the same underlying dynamical theory , and should give almost the same results .    motivated by the above considerations , our main objective in this paper is to investigate the @xmath0 scalar glueball in the frame work of gaussian sum rules . for the correlation function",
    ", we include the contributions from the interactions between the quantum gluons and the classical instanton background besides the ones comeing separately from these two different field configurations . for the spectral function , instead of using the usual zero - width approximation",
    ", we adopt the breit - wigner form for the considered resonance with correct threshold behavior , in order to get the information of not only the mass scale but also the full decay width . moreover , without using the scheme of the mixture of the traditional condensates and the so - called direct - instanton contribution , we are working in the framework of the semiclassical expansion of qcd in the instanton liquid vacuum , a well - defined self - consistent procedure for the quantum theory justified by the path - integral quantization formalism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : corfunct ] , we give the expression for the correlation function of the @xmath0 scalar gluon current .",
    "the spectral function corresponding to this current is constructed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sepctfunct ] .",
    "then , a family of the finite - width gaussian sum rules are derived in sec . [ sec : fwgsr ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , the numerical simulation is carried out . finally , a summery of our conclusions and a discussion are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the correlation function for the scalar glueball in the euclidean space - time with a virtuality @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the physical vacuum , and @xmath11 the scalar glueball current with the quantum numbers @xmath12 @xmath13 in which , @xmath14 denotes the strong coupling constant .",
    "the scalar glueball current @xmath11 is gauge - invariant , and renormalization - invariant at one - loop level . in the spirit of the semiclassical expansion , and in order to maintain the @xmath15 covariance , the gluon field strength tensor @xmath16",
    "is considered as a functional of the full gluon potential , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the instanton fields and the corresponding quantum fluctuations .",
    "the theoretical expression , @xmath20 , for the correlation function @xmath21 may be divided into the following three parts @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the contributions from the only perturbative qcd , the pure instanton dynamics , and the interactions between the instantons and the quantum gluon fields , respectively .    the perturbative contribution @xmath24 is already known to be @xmath27\\label{eq : pert},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the renormalization scale in the @xmath29-dimensional regularization scheme , and the coefficients with the inclusion of the threshold effects are @xmath30 , \\nonumber\\\\ a_1&=&2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\right)^3\\left[\\frac9{4 } + 65.781\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\right)\\right],\\label{eq : pert3}\\\\ a_2&=&-10.1252\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\right)^4.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for qcd with three quark flavors up to three - loop level in the chiral limit @xcite , and @xmath31 , \\nonumber\\\\ a_1&=&\\frac{11}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\right)^3 , \\quad a_2=0.\\label{eq : pert2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for quarkless qcd up to two - loop level @xcite .",
    "both expressions for @xmath24 with and without quark loop corrections are used in our calculation for comparison . with the assumption that the dominant contribution to @xmath25 comes from a belavin - polyakov - schwartz - tyupkin single instanton and anti - instanton solutions @xcite and",
    "the multi - instanton effects are negligible ( see a qcd spectral sum rule ( qssr ) approach @xcite ) , and in view of the gauge - invariance of the correlation function , one may choose to work in the regular gauge of the classical single instanton potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the t hooft symbol , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the position and size of the instanton , respectively .",
    "the pure instanton contribution is obtained to be @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mcdonald function , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the overall instanton density and the average instanton size in the random instanton background , respectively .",
    "it is noticed that the contribution to @xmath20 from the interactions between instantons and the quantum gluon fields is of the order of the product of @xmath14 and the overall instanton density @xmath40 .",
    "there is no reason to get rid of this contribution in comparison with the perturbative contributions of the higher order @xmath41 considered in @xmath42 . to calculate such contribution ,",
    "our key observation is that the instanton potential @xmath43 obeys also the fixed - point gauge condition @xmath44 due to the antisymmetry of the t hooft symbols . as a consequence",
    ", the instanton potential can be expressed in terms of the corresponding field strength tensor as follows : @xmath45(x - x_0)_{\\nu }     \\label{eq : gauge - condition}\\ ] ] and the gauge link with respect to the instanton fields is just the unit operator , and thus the trace of any product of the gauge - covariant instanton field strengths at different points is gauge - invariant .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the remainder quantum corrections to the gauge - invariant correlation function , arising from the interactions between the instantons and the quantum gluons , is gauge - invariant as well .",
    "therefore , one may choose any specific gauge in evaluating the quantum correction to @xmath46 .",
    "it is noticed that the interference between the pure quantum part of the scalar glueball current , @xmath47 , and the pure classical instanton part , @xmath48 is vanishing due to the fact that the momentum integration of the massless gluon propagator or the product of massless quark and gluon propagators has no scale parameters , and is exactly zero in the dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "the first nonvanishing contribution comes from the contraction between the two quantum glueball currents with instanton legs .",

    "( [ eq : current ] ) .",
    "recall the threshold behavior for @xmath54 @xmath57 which is deduced from a low - energy theorem @xcite .",
    "the early qcd sum rule approach had often used @xmath58 in the whole lowest resonance region , however the obtained mass scale is too low to be expected in comparison with the lattice qcd results .",
    "in fact , the threshold behavior ( [ eq : threshold ] ) is only proven to be valid in the chiral limit ; it may not be extrapolated far away .",
    "therefore , instead of considering the coupling @xmath59 as a constant @xcite , we choose a model for @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are some constants determined late in numerical simulation , so that the spectral function @xmath54 has the almost complete breit - wigner form with correct threshold behavior , and in cooperation with the threshold behavior which is important for the convergence of the corresponding integral . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , the constant @xmath62 is invoked for the discontinuity at the chiral symmetry breaking .    although glueballs are well defined in quarkless qcd , the mixing with mesons makes the phenomenological side more complicated in full qcd ; all scalar hadron states having a glue content should be interpolated by the gluonic current , and then present in the correlator with different couplings . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the glueball is shared between the three scalar hadrons .",
    "these three hadrons are very close in mass ; the assumption of single resonance maybe be not appropriate .",
    "the form of the spectral function for three resonances we will use is taken to be @xmath63 where all @xmath64 have the form shown in ( [ eq : lambda ] ) with the same @xmath61 , because @xmath61 is fixed to be 5 gev by the low - energy theorem of qcd , and so that its value is independent of what an individual resonance considered .",

    "the widths of the lowest three @xmath0 resonances coupled to the glueball current @xmath11 are predicted in ( [ eq : average3 ] ) , from which we can read off the corresponding couplings @xmath143 to the three resonances @xmath116 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 with masses @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 gev as @xmath147 respectively .    in summary , we may conclude that , first , any @xmath0 scalar resonance below 1 gev , such as @xmath148 , contains almost no component of the scalar glueball ; second , the values of the mass and decay width of the @xmath0 resonance , in which the fraction of the scalar glueball state is dominant , are @xmath149 gev and @xmath150 gev , respectively , and the value of its coupling to the corresponding current is @xmath151 ; third , the fractions of the scalar glueball contained in the other nearby @xmath0 scalar resonances , @xmath116 and @xmath2 , are also appreciable .",
    "these are not only compatible with lattice qcd simulation @xcite and other estimations @xcite , but also in good accordance with the experimental data of the low scalar resonances @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that the three gaussian sum rules lead to almost the same results , a consistency between the subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules is very well justified .",
    "we note that we have not been working within the mixed scheme , namely with including condensates , and in the same time , adopting the so - called direct - instanton approximation , but simply with a self - consistent framework , a quantum theory in a classical background , without the problem of double counting . in this aspect",
    ", our results further justified the instanton liquid model for qcd among many other justifications .    in our semiclassical expansion ,",
    "the leading contribution to the sum rules comes from instantons themselves , especially in the region below the threshold @xmath53 .",
    "it is the amount of this contribution that determines the low bound of the sum rule window .",
    "this means that the nonlinear configurations of gluons have a dominant role with respect to the quantum fluctuations in the low - energy region .",
    "the contribution of the interactions between the classical instanton fields and quantum gluon ones , considered in this paper but neglected in earlier sum rule calculations @xcite , is in fact not negligible . to the contrary ,",
    "its amount is approximately double or even triple that from the pure quantum fluctuations in the whole fiducial domain , expected from a view point of the semiclassical expansion .",
    "moreover , it is obviously seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : gbw - gsr-1500]-[fig:3bw - gsr-1370 ] that , without taking the contribution from the interactions between instantons and quantum gluons into account , the departures between @xmath152 and @xmath153 without interaction become large , and all three gaussian sum rules become less stable , and thus less reliable .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the imaginary part of the instanton contribution is an oscillating , amplifying and nonpositive defined function , and so is the imaginary part of the correlation function .",
    "this property which is a fatal problem for the qcd sum rule calculation with the instanton background , may make the contribution of continuum too large to be under control .",
    "hilmar forkel introduced a gaussian distribution for the instanton to get rid off this trouble , and obtained a smaller @xmath0 mass scale : @xmath128 gev @xcite compared to the earlier result @xmath131 gev @xcite .",
    "we did not use this gaussian distribution , but simply chose a smaller fitting parameter to avoid this problem .",
