    "the stability of a dipolar bec depends on the scattering length as well as the trap geometry @xcite .",

    "<S> we study properties of a trapped dipolar bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a circular ring or a spherical shell using the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation . in the case of the ring - shaped trap we consider different orientations of the ring with respect to the polarization direction of the dipoles . in the presence of long - range anisotropic </S>",
    "<S> dipolar and short - range contact interactions , the anisotropic density distribution of the dipolar bec in both traps is discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the stability condition of the dipolar bec in both traps is illustrated in phase plot of dipolar and contact interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we also study and discuss the properties of a vortex dipolar bec in these traps . </S>"
