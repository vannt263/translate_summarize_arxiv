    "we are interested in the asymptotic theory of hypothesis testing with two hypotheses .",
    "suppose there are many identical physical systems , each independently being in some random states , subject to the same statistical description .",
    "here the statistical description is probability distribution in classical world and quantum state which is positive semi - definite matrix with trace 1 in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the statistical description is not fixed : it has two possibilities , say , either @xmath0 ( the null hypothesis ) or @xmath1 ( the alternative hypothesis ) .",
    "thus the task is to identify which statistical description is the true one , based on the instances of the physical systems .",
    "it is the central problem in asymptotic hypothesis testing to characterize the behavior of errors .",
    "an intuitive understanding is that the probabilities of mistaking one hypothesis for the other can be made arbitrarily small when the sample size @xmath2 is big enough , except for the trivial case that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the same . however",
    ", assuming exponential decay , we want to optimize the rate exponent with which the error of concern , under certain reasonable preconditions , converges to zero . in the classical setting ,",
    "this problem has been well understood , featured with a list of famous results  @xcite , including the celebrated stein s lemma , chernoff distance and hoeffding bound .",
    "these results are all obtainable using the likelihood ratio tests .",
    "in contrast to its classical counterpart , the problem of quantum hypothesis testing becomes very difficult due to the noncommutativity of the two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the more complicated mechanics for observing the underlying physical systems , that is , quantum measurement .",
    "although the quantum generalization of the likelihood ratio test was obtained in the 1970s  @xcite , its structure is not clear in the aymptotic limit . yet , substantial achievements have been made since .    in 1991 ,",
    "hiai and petz established the quantum stein s lemma , providing rigorous operational interpretation for the quantum relative entropy , or quantum kullback ",
    "leibler divergence  @xcite",
    ". then its optimality part was strengthened by ogawa and nagaoka , with a strong converse theorem  @xcite .",
    "more recently , quantum chernoff distance , the optimal rate exponent under which the average error tends to @xmath3 in the setting of symmetric hypothesis testing , has been identified in two seminal papers .",
    "the achievability part was due to audenaert et al .",
    "@xcite , and the optimality part was by nussbaum and szkoa  @xcite .",
    "the methods invented in these two papers were subsequently used to derive the quantum hoeffding bound  @xcite .",
    "the quantum stein s lemma characterizes the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing . besides the breakthroughs mentioned above , some other important progresses in this regime can be found in  @xcite . to state this result , we define two types of errors . type  i error ( or  the error of the first kind ) is the probability that we incorrectly accept the alternative hypothesis @xmath4 while it is actually the null hypothesis @xmath5 , and type  ii error ( or the error of the second kind ) is the probability of the opposite situation . in an asymmetric setting ,",
    "we want to minimize the type  ii error while only simply requiring that the type  i error converges to @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the support of the operator @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum stein s lemma states that the maximal exponent of type  ii error is the quantum relative entropy  @xcite , given by @xmath8 it also asserts that if the type  ii error goes to @xmath3 with an exponent larger than @xmath9 , then the type  i error inevitably converges to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "however , the drawback of the quantum stein s lemma is that it characterizes the asymptotic behavior of errors in a relatively coarse - grained way . to be precise",
    ", it considers only the linear term of the type  ii error exponent , which is of the order @xmath2 ( we call it the first order ) . as a result ,",
    "the optimal type  i error jumps sharply from  @xmath3 to  @xmath10 when the rate exponent of type  ii error  quantified by its first order  passes by the relative entropy @xmath9 from the smaller side to the larger side .    in this paper",
    ", we prove the second - order asymptotic theorem , and thus fundamentally refine the quantum stein s lemma . specifically , we track the exponent of the type  ii error in depth , to the order @xmath11 ( we call it the second order ) , and clarify how the type  i error varies smoothly as a function of this second - order exponent",
    ". a variance - like quantity , defined as @xmath12 will play an important role , and we name it the _ quantum relative variance _ of @xmath0 and  @xmath1 .",
    "write the second - order rate exponent of the type  ii error as @xmath13 .",
    "then our result shows that , asymptotically , the minimal type  i error is given by @xmath14 , which grows smoothly from @xmath3 to @xmath10 when @xmath13 increases from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution , and its appearance in our result comes from the use of the central limit theorem in the proof .",
    "we also obtain very tight bounds for the case of finite sample size @xmath2 .",
    "supposing that the type  i error is no larger than a constant @xmath18 , we minimize the type  ii error and consider its negative logarithm .",
    "then we derive upper and lower bounds for this quantity , based on the method for proving our second - order asymptotic theorem .",
    "this enables us to establish that this quantity can be written as @xmath19 the first two terms coincide with the results of the quantum stein s lemma and our second - order asymptotic theorem , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the next leading term ( this is the term of the third order ) , included in @xmath20 of the above formula , lies between a constant and @xmath21 .",
    "our results have potential applications in quantum information theory .",
    "there is a deep connection between hypothesis testing and other topics in information theory ( e.g. , channel capacity ) , both in the classical regime  @xcite and in the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "recently , this connection has been generalized to the one - shot scenario as well  @xcite .",
    "indeed , such a connection is very helpful in the derivation of the second - order coding rate and finite blocklength analysis in classical channel coding  @xcite .",
    "our results make it possible to investigate the second - order and finite blocklength analysis for classical information transmission over quantum channels .",
    "we point out that the results presented here are independently and concurrently obtained by tomamichel and hayashi  @xcite , using a different method . in  @xcite",
    ", such analysis is conducted in the context of one - shot entropies and has been applied to the tasks of data compression with quantum side information and randomness extraction against quantum side information .",
    "the bounds for finite sample size in these two works are slightly different ; see section  [ sectionfinite - sample - size ] for details .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sectionsecond - order - asymptotics",
    "] , we present our main result of second - order asymptotics . then we prove it in section  [ sectionproof ] .",

    "finally , we give the proofs to technical lemmas in the .",

    "the state of the quantum system is described by a density matrix @xmath22 , which is a nonnegative definite matrix in the hilbert space and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath23 . to detect the quantum system",
    ", we have to do quantum measurement , which , in the most general form , is formulated as positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . then the measurement outcome @xmath27 is obtained with probability @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a large number @xmath2 of identical quantum systems , each of which has finite level and is associated with the hilbert space @xmath29 of finite dimension @xmath30 .",
    "given that the quantum systems are either of the state @xmath5 ( the null hypothesis ) or of the state @xmath4 ( the alternative hypothesis ) , we want to identify which state the systems belong to . without loss of generality , this can be done by applying a two - outcome povm @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , on the joint hilbert space @xmath33 of the quantum systems .",
    "if we obtain the outcome associated to @xmath34 , then we conclude that the state is @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , the outcome associated to @xmath35 corresponds to the state @xmath4 .",
    "the error probabilities of the first kind and the second kind are , respectively , given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the quantum stein s lemma shows that the relative entropy @xmath38 is a critical jump point in the asymptotics of asymmetric hypothesis testing .",
    "explicitly , it is stated in two parts as follows :    * direct part  @xcite : for arbitrary @xmath39 , there exist tests @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 * strong converse  @xcite : if a sequence of tests @xmath42 is such that @xmath43 then @xmath44 .    instead of the rate exponent @xmath45 considered in the quantum stein s lemma ,",
    "we are concerned with a smaller order of the type  ii error exponent , that is , @xmath46",
    ". then we think about the optimal tradeoff between the asymptotic limit of this quantity and the type  i error @xmath47 . in an equivalent way",
    ", we define the error - dependency functions as follows and present our result subsequently .",
    "[ deferror - function ] let @xmath48 , and @xmath49 be a fixed function of some order other than @xmath2 or @xmath11 , which is to be specified when necessary .",
    "we define a sequence of functions @xmath50 , which reflects the dependency of the minimal error probability of the first kind on the error exponent of the second kind , up to the order @xmath2 and @xmath11 , as @xmath51    if @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 .",
    "asymptotically , the optimal error probability of the first kind is always @xmath3 , while the error exponent of the second kind can be arbitrarily large . in such a case",
    ", the second - order asymptotics makes no sense .",
    "so , in this paper , we suppose @xmath54 , and without loss of generality , we further suppose @xmath1 is of full rank .    our main result is the following theorem .",

    "we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution , that is , @xmath59 .",
    "the second case of equation  ( [ eqsecond - order - asymptotics ] ) is our second - order asymptotics .",
    "in fact , it implies the first and third cases , which are nothing else but the direct part and strong converse of quantum stein s lemma , respectively .",
    "we include them here such that one easily gets the full information at first sight . to see this , we take the first case , for example .",

    "now letting @xmath67 , the first case of equation  ( [ eqsecond - order - asymptotics ] ) follows immediately since @xmath68 is always nonnegative .",
    "we divide theorem  [ thmsecond - order - asymptotics ] ( precisely , its second case ) into the achievability part and optimality part , and equivalently reformulate it below .",

    "the relation between our second - order asymptotics and the quantum stein s lemma is similar in spirit to the relation between the central limit theorem and the week law of large numbers .",

    "we have succeeded in proving the results using elementary linear algebra and probability theory in a unified fashion for the achievability part and optimality part .",
    "specifically , we have explicitly constructed a sequence of asymptotically optimal tests for our problem , specifying the bases of spaces onto which the projective measurements are applied by employing a modified gram ",

    "schmidt orthonormalization process has already been used in order to find the asymptotically optimal tests for testing multiple hypotheses in the symmetric setting ( regarding the chernoff bound ) .",
    "the attempt in  @xcite is successful in some special cases , and is successful in general up to a constant factor @xmath254 .",
    "we notice that even for two hypotheses , such an elementary method is not known for fully proving the achievability of the chernoff bound ; recall that the original  and hitherto unique  proof in  @xcite was based on the nontrivial matrix inequality @xmath255 , for all @xmath256 .    the case that @xmath257 is a singular point in theorem  [ thmsecond - order - asymptotics ] and theorem  [ thmfinite - sample - size ] ; however , we will see that this represents a very trivial case within classical hypothesis testing .",
    "using lemma  [ lemmacq - duality ] , we check that the equivalent conditions of @xmath257 is as follows : ( i ) @xmath258 and @xmath1 commute .",
    "this means that @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be simultaneously diagonalized as @xmath80 and @xmath259 , and our problem reduces to a classical one with probability laws @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "( ii ) there is a constant @xmath262 such that for all @xmath100 with @xmath263 , we have @xmath264 ; and actually @xmath265 . assigning arbitrarily any @xmath90 with nonzero @xmath136 to the null hypothesis @xmath5 , we obtain the best tradeoff between the type  i error @xmath244 and type  ii error @xmath245 , and this is expressed as @xmath266 .",
    "we give proofs to the two lemmas presented in section  [ subsectionproof - prep ] .",
    "proof of lemma  [ lemmacq - duality ] this is done by direct calculation . for functions @xmath267  and  @xmath268 , it is obvious that @xmath269 and @xmath270 using these two equations with proper @xmath267 and @xmath268 at every step when needed , we get @xmath271\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\sum_{xy}p_{x , y}(x , y)\\log \\frac{\\lambda(x)}{\\mu(y)}={\\mathrm{e}}\\biggl(\\log\\frac{\\lambda ( x)}{\\mu(y ) } \\biggr)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath272 & & \\hspace*{48pt } { } -2\\lambda(x)\\log\\lambda(x ) \\log\\mu(y)|\\gamma_{xy}|^2+\\lambda(x)\\log^2\\mu(y)|\\gamma_{xy}|^2 \\bigr)\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad = \\sum_{xy}p_{x , y}(x , y ) \\biggl(\\log \\frac{\\lambda(x)}{\\mu(y ) } \\biggr)^2 = { \\mathrm{e}}\\biggl(\\log\\frac { \\lambda(x)}{\\mu(y ) } \\biggr)^2.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eqlemmcd-1 ] ) confirms equation  ( [ eqr - e - e ] ) , and equations  ( [ eqlemmcd-1 ] ) and ( [ eqlemmcd-2 ] ) together lead to equation  ( [ eqr - v - v ] ) .",
