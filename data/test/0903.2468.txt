    "the rashba and dresselhaus so interactions arise in materials which lack either structural or bulk inversion symmetry , respectively@xcite .",
    "these two kinds of interactions have recently been given a great deal of attention due to their potential role in the generation and manipulation of spin polarized currents , spin filters@xcite , spin accumulation@xcite , and spin optics@xcite .",
    "a reformulation of the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian in terms of non - abelian gauge fields@xcite was explicitly given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the so interaction is presented as a @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "as the yang - mills gauge theory is well understood and is the underpinning of well established theory , enormous insight can be brought upon new problems .",
    "such gauge point of view , in more general terms , has been known for some time@xcite .",
    "this formulation is very revealing , since the consistent gauge structure of the theory becomes obvious and the physics of spin currents , persistent currents and color diamagnetism@xcite can be understood in a manner analogous to the well known @xmath1 gauge theories .",
    "a consistent @xmath0 gauge approach was presented in reference @xcite where it was found that for the pauli type hamiltonians ( including rashba and 2 dimensional reductions of the dresselhaus hamiltonian ) , gauge symmetry breaking ( gsb ) is necessarily built into the theory and leads to vanishing of the spin conductivity in constant electric fields@xcite .",
    "in addition , the yang mills interpretation of the rashba and dresselhaus so interactions renders the associated gauge fields real , with topological consequences analogous to the aharonov casher effect@xcite .",
    "recent proposals were recently reported for the construction of perfect spin filters based on active rashba spin orbit media@xcite , ballistic spin interferometers@xcite and the analysis of the persistent spin helix@xcite , where the yang mills gauge point of view is advantageous . here",
    "we readdress the problem of spin filtering by interferometry in a quasi two dimensional system , and make connection to an experimentally feasible test of these ideas through an electronic mach zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) within rashba and dresselhaus media .",
    "recent proposals contemplating this setup as an spin intereference device include quantum logic gates@xcite , bit controlled stern - gerlach devices@xcite and tunable entanglement@xcite .",
    "our analysis , within this setup , enables us to obtain exact conditions for spin filtering which can be achieved by tuning appropriate experimental parameters .",
    "such conditions for spin filtering greatly generalize previous special situations where the spin polarization is a conserved quantity@xcite , and show new possibilities for spin filtering beyond previous approximate treatments .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we consider the hamiltonian with both rashba and dresselhaus interactions for a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) including a magnetic flux described by a @xmath1 gauge field . following the approach given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we rewrite the rashba and dresselhaus contributions in terms of a yang mills gauge field and review how this approach leads to the introduction of a gsb term analogous to the proca term for the maxwell field . then , we propose an interference setup in the form of an electronic mzi where the electron s spin transport is modulated due to the presence of rashba and dresselhaus active media .",
    "we derive the conditions for perfect spin filtering that are applicable independently of the incoming spin state and the full energy range of the injected electrons .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a two dimensional system consisting of non interacting electrons subject to both rashba and dresselhaus spin orbit interactions .",
    "in addition , one can apply an external transverse magnetic flux @xmath2 described by a @xmath1 gauge vector potential @xmath3 .",
    "two recent works have shown how to measure and control the rashba and dresselhaus parameters using gate voltages in two dimensional gaas / algaas electron gas@xcite .",
    "it is striking that one can achieve so magnetic fields of 2 - 3 mt .",
    "the so physics beautifully follows an extended weak localization theory that allows for a detailed access to the material parameters .",
    "one can address the two dimensional gaas / algaas electron gas by a single particle hamiltonian including the previously described couplings by @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron s charge and effective mass , @xmath8 a substrate lattice potential that can be assumed periodic , @xmath9 is a vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are material - dependent parameters characterizing the rashba and dresselhaus interactions , respectively .",
    "the last term is the zeeman energy . the term linear in @xmath12 describing the dresselhaus interaction results from averaging a cubic in @xmath12 contribution ( for the bulk ) in the confining direction and neglecting other cubic terms in the strong lateral confinement situation@xcite . in the rest of this work we ignore the effect of the zeeman term in the limit of small magnetic fields ( a few flux quanta through a @xmath13 area ) such that the spin orbit energy is much larger than the zeeman energy@xcite .",
    "according to measured parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite the so energy for an gaas / algaas electron gas is 5 orders of magnitude greater than the zeeman energy for the proposed field strengths . this way the external magnetic field results in strong phase effects through the vector potential but no appreciable",
    "precession occurs due to the zeeman term .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that there are spin filtering scenarios for the device even for zero external magnetic field .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce a spin dependent ( non - abelian ) gauge field @xmath14 whose components are given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 coupling constant . using this gauge field",
    "we can rewrite equation ( [ h1 ] ) , having ignored the zeeman contribution , in the form @xmath19     through the square.,width=8 ]    the first term describes the total kinetic energy taking into account the contribution from the regular vector potential due to an external magnetic field and the non abelian gauge field .",
    "the second term is the background lattice potential whereas the third term represents a gauge symmetry breaking contribution similar to the field originally discussed in references @xcite responsible for rendering the spin currents physical .",
    "a device configuration that allows us to address the problem of spin filtering in a gauge independent@xcite manner is the mach zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) .",
    "the setup for an mzi is sketched in ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "here we are interested in determining the resulting amplitude @xmath20 at detector @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and to find the conditions for perfect spin filtering @xcite at either detector .",
    "there is an interesting issue that must be discussed regarding spin @xmath23 filtering . if the state at the input is a pure state spinor of spin @xmath23 , the electron is polarized on some indeterminate axis , in principle random , coming from the fermi sea of the input conductor .",
    "if one could find this axis for every electron extracted then one would have a perfect spin filter for each electron .",
    "nevertheless the resulting current is unpolarized .",
    "we thus define the spin filter as one acting on any entering ( pure state ) polarization and returning a polarized state along a definite axis .",
    "this approach will serve to build a polarized spin current .",
    "the relevant processes within the interferometer are described as follows ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) : single electrons are assumed to be extracted from the fermi sea as pure states @xmath24 .",
    "the electrons then pass through a beam splitter that can be implemented by a combination of quantum point contacts@xcite the first of which we label @xmath25 described by a @xmath26 scattering matrix @xmath27 that mixes spin orientations on perpendicular reflection , while it is diagonal for direct ( no change in direction ) transmission@xcite .",
    "mixing of spin orientations occurs at all reflections ( including mirrors ) due to changes in direction of the electron @xmath28 vector within spin - orbit active media that changes the orientation of the implied wavevector - dependent magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , as we consider both rashba and dresselhaus interactions , we need to derive general reflection conditions at the beam splitters and mirrors . in reference",
    "@xcite , this was done for rashba assuming that small enough spin - orbit strength would yield only a small divergence of the reflected spin states in a @xmath28 dependent basis .",
    "surprisingly , when only the rashba interaction is involved , the reflection matrix depends only on the incident angle and the reflection coefficient . on the other hand , if both dresselhaus and rashba are included , this is no longer true , and except for special angles of incidence , the reflection matrix depends on both rashba and dresselhaus strengths .",
    "the general reflection matrices are derived in the appendix . in this paper",
    "we will take the limit of @xmath29 reflections , that leads to simple , spin - orbit independent matrix elements .",
    "the resulting beams follow path @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) that consists of a first horizontal @xmath32 ( vertical @xmath33 ) arm made of rashba - dresselhaus medium whose length is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the electrons are then specularly reflected from an ideal mirror @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , that also mixes spin directions , followed by a vertical @xmath38 ( horizontal @xmath39 ) arm of length @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) of the same material .",
    "the mirrors can be implemented as a simplified version of the beam splitters of reference @xcite .",
    "then the electrons pass through a second qpc ( @xmath40 ) described by the corresponding s - matrix @xmath41 .",
    "finally , two electron beams are collected at detector @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and we have @xmath42 , where , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the corresponding transferred spinor through the i_th_-arm . these amplitudes can be written in terms of the injected spinor @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where the @xmath47 matrices @xmath48 ( generalized comparator operators @xcite ) are given by @xmath49 } ( r_l)\\exp{\\big[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l}_i}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( t_1)+\\nonumber\\\\ ( r_{2l } ) \\exp{\\big [ \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l'}_{ii}}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( r_r)\\exp{\\big[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l}_{ii}}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( r_{1l}),\\nonumber\\\\ \\fl{\\cal u}_{d_2}=(r_{2r } ) \\exp{\\big [ \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l'}_{i}}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( r_l)\\exp{\\big[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l}_i}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( t_1)+\\nonumber\\\\ ( t_2 ) \\exp{\\big [ \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l'}_{ii}}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( r_r)\\exp{\\big[\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{{\\mathcal l}_{ii}}{d { \\bf l}\\cdot}({\\bf p}-e{\\bf a}-g{{\\cal w}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!{\\cal w}}^a\\tau^a)\\big ] } ( r_{1l}).\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such operators applied to the initial state do not change the energy expectation value .",

    "this simply means that the amplitudes received at the detectors do not interfere .",

    "in this section we consider a simplified version of the filtering device where beam splitters and mirrors are considered diagonal matrices or scalars . although this approximation does not contemplate the matrix nature of the reflections we will obtain a simple scenario for the filtering properties of the device .",
    "the full problem will be treated below where essentially the same qualitative results are obtained .",
    "if the electric field @xmath61 is uniform and static , the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 commute .",

    "since we are interested in filtering one spin component , say the up component , we now proceed to determine the vanishing conditions of the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath99 .    from expressions ( [ evalue1 ] , [ evalue2 ] ) ,",

    "such a solution is also the simplest from the detection point of view since it involves the choice of a single quantization axis for the whole setup .",
    "the second condition ( @xmath101 ) corresponds to finding a new axis where the up spin is filtered and we call such axis the _ tilted _ quantization axis . note that both these filtering conditions ( non - tilted and tilted ) are _ independent of the polarization axis and the energy of the incoming state_. we will comment further on this below .      let us first analyze the _ non - tilted _ situation .",

    "we recall that the previous discussion in section [ idealtilted ] is equally valid in this case , all incoming electrons at the input are polarized at the output no matter their energy as long as particular parameters ranges in the @xmath152 space are met .     upon a contourplot for the modulus of the second eigenvalue .",
    "the lighter shades represent higher values of the output polarization .",
    "one can extract the so strengths from the plot by solving a simple system of equations for each value read off on the dashed curves.,width=566 ]    in order to see the magnitude of the spin polarization for a particular value of the external magnetic field we draw a contour map of the magnitude of the second eigenvalue while the first one is zero .",
    "the background value at the dashed curves in figure [ fig8 ] , show the intensity of the pure down spin polarization at detector @xmath129 when at @xmath153 .",
    "the highest values of output achieved corresponds to the lighter shades on the contourmap .",
    "we have proposed a perfect spin filtering device based on a mach - zehnder type spin interferometer .",
    "the regimes of operation are subject to no limitations on the spin - orbit strengths and interferometer dimensions as in previous work .",
    "the treatment can be easily extended to unequal arm lengths and angles of incidence on the mirrors / beam splitters , that are likely to occur in the actual implementation of the interferometer .",
    "such a generalization would provide additional parameters to manipulate filtering conditions . in the simpler analysis above involving scalar mirrors , we find both a non - tilted and tilted axis spin filtering solutions referred to the axis of quantization in which one writes the input states and for arbitrary incoming energies . the non - tilted case is not found in the scenario where the @xmath18 gauge field is approximated by a @xmath1 like gauge , and is peculiar to the full non - abelian treatment .",
    "this solution has the advantage of simplicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the tilted axis solutions are shown to be well approximated by the abelianized forms of reference @xcite valid for certain reasonable conditions of so strengths in relation to the interferometer arm lengths .",
    "when realistic mirrors / beam splitters are introduced , the mixing of the spinor components leads only to non - tilted solutions when @xmath29 reflections are contemplated .",
    "in this situation we run out of adjustable parameters to tune a non - tilted solution , that should be recovered when other incidence angles are considered .",
    "the qualitative scenarios for the operation of the diagonal and non - diagonal mirrors are the same and only the parameter combinations for filtering change .",
    "perfect filtering means that all spins in one of the detectors are polarized always in the same axis and orientation .",
    "this has the drawback that the current is not steady since the probability of producing a completely polarized electron varies with the initial projection , of the input spinor , onto the chosen quantization axis .",
    "this projection is random as electrons are injected from the fermi sea@xcite .",
    "a density matrix approach should be implemented so that one can also assess finite temperature effects on the filter operation .",
    "it should be also noted that the interference setup does not produce a pure spin current , since polarization is accompanied by a charge current .    an interesting insight , exploiting the analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect in the abelian case , comes from observing the role of @xmath154 in the non - abelian case .",
    "@xmath154 and the voltage @xmath8 essentially play the same role as the pair @xmath155 and magnetic flux . indeed , for a purely pauli type",
    "so interaction , as @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then @xmath154 can be rewritten as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , the voltage along the arm of length @xmath160 in an electric field of strength @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath162 is a quantum of voltage@xcite .",
    "although @xmath162 is very large for this calculation , the material rashba coefficient would lower it to the order of @xmath163 .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with c. chatelain , j. c. egues and r. winkler .",
    "this work was supported by cnrs - fonacit grant pi-2008000272 .",
    "here we derive the general conditions for reflection at a beam splitter on a mirror in the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus interactions . starting from hamiltonian in equation [ hamiltonian ]",
    "we can solve exactly for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . ignoring the zeeman term we have     output while @xmath123 filters out the up spin component ( spin down polarization ) .",

    "the convention we take , according to the figure , is that @xmath169 are positive components for the incident electron",
    ". referred to those components , one can obtain the reflected basis components by changing @xmath170 and @xmath171 as the momentum in the @xmath172 direction is conserved . to obtain the projections in terms of the reflected basis",
    "we write @xmath173 where the subindex on the right indicates the reflected complete basis set .",
    "one can then compute the superposition coefficients @xmath174 and @xmath175 by performing the appropriate overlaps between incoming and outgoing wavefunctions @xmath176,\\cr",
    "b_{\\pm}&= &   _ r\\langle k - |k \\pm\\rangle_i=1/2\\left [ 1 \\mp f^*(-k_x , k_y)f(k_x , k_y)\\right ] .",

    "the previous coefficients govern the @xmath25 , the upper reflection of @xmath40 and @xmath36 in figure [ fig1 ] , while exchanges of @xmath178 would generate the corresponding matrix for the @xmath37 and the bottom reflection of @xmath40 .",
    "the wavector components can be expressed as @xmath179 for a generic incident angle as seen in the figure . for the case of @xmath180 ,",
    "the reflection matrices are particularly simple and one obtains equation [ reflectionmatrix ] , where the transmission matrix is trivially diagonal since the electron beam does not change direction .",
    "a coordinate independent way to state the general result is by identifying @xmath181 and @xmath182 then one can write the full reflection / transmission matrix as @xmath183   & i r\\sin[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ] & t & 0\\\\     i r\\sin[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ]   & r\\cos[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ]   & 0 & t\\\\      t & 0 & r\\cos[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ] & -i r \\sin[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2]\\\\      0 & t & -i r\\sin[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ] & r\\cos[(\\phi_r-\\phi_i)/2 ] \\end{array}\\right ) \\ ] ]",
