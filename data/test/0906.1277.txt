    "shock waves occur in many physical situations in nature . for example",
    ", shock waves can be produced by solar winds ( bow shocks ) , supersonic or near sonic aircrafts ( transonic shocks around the body ) , explosions ( blast waves ) , and various natural processes .",
    "when such a shock hits an obstacle ( steady or flying ) , shock reflection - diffraction phenomena occur .",
    "one of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics is the problem of shock reflection - diffraction by a wedge .",
    "when the plane shock hits a wedge head on , it experiences a reflection - diffraction process , and then a fundamental question is what types of wave patterns of reflection - diffraction configurations it may form around the wedge .",
    "the complexity of reflection - diffraction configurations was first reported by ernst mach @xcite in 1878 , who first observed two patterns of reflection - diffraction configurations : regular reflection ( two - shock configuration ) and mach reflection ( three - shock configuration ) ; also see @xcite .",
    "the problem remained dormant until the 1940 s when von neumann , friedrichs , bethe , as well as many experimental scientists , among others , began extensive research into all aspects of shock reflection - diffraction phenomena , due to its importance in applications .",
    "see von neumann @xcite and ben - dor @xcite ; also see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "it has been found that the situation is much more complicated than what mach originally observed : the mach reflection can be further divided into more specific sub - patterns , and various other patterns of shock reflection - diffraction may occur such as the von neumann reflection and the guderley reflection ; see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "then the fundamental scientific issues include :    \\(i ) _ structure of the shock reflection - diffraction configurations _ ;    \\(ii ) _ transition criteria between the different patterns of shock reflection - diffraction configurations _ ;    \\(iii ) _ dependence of the patterns upon the physical parameters such as the wedge angle @xmath0 , the incident - shock - wave mach number @xmath1 , and the adiabatic exponent @xmath2_.    careful asymptotic analysis has been made for various reflection - diffraction configurations in lighthill @xcite , keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , morawetz @xcite , @xcite , and the references cited therein ; also see glimm - majda @xcite .",
    "large or small scale numerical simulations have been also made ; see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references cited therein .",
    "however , most of the fundamental issues for shock reflection - diffraction phenomena have not been understood , especially the global structure and transition of different patterns of shock reflection - diffraction configurations .",
    "this is partially because physical and numerical experiments are hampered by various difficulties and have not been able to select the correct transition criteria between different patterns . in particular , numerical dissipation or physical viscosity",
    "smear the shocks and cause boundary layers that interact with the reflection - diffraction patterns and can cause _ spurious mach steams _ ; cf . woodward - colella @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some difference between two different patterns are only fractions of a degree apart ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "5 below ) , a resolution even by sophisticated modern experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) has been unable to reach , as pointed out by ben - dor in @xcite :  _ for this reason it is almost impossible to distinguish experimentally between the sonic and detachment criteria _ \" ( cf .",
    "section 5 below ) . in this regard",
    ", it seems that the ideal approach to understand fully the shock reflection - diffraction phenomena , especially the transition criteria , is still via rigorous mathematical analysis . to achieve this ,",
    "it is essential to establish first the global existence , regularity , and structural stability of solutions of the shock reflection - diffraction problem .    on the other hand ,",
    "shock reflection - diffraction configurations are the core configurations in the structure of global solutions of the two - dimensional riemann problem for hyperbolic conservation laws ; while the riemann solutions are building blocks and local structure of general solutions and determine global attractors and asymptotic states of entropy solutions , as time tends to infinity , for multidimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws .",
    "see @xcite and the references cited therein . in this sense , we have to understand the shock reflection - diffraction phenomena , in order to understand fully entropy solutions to multidimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws .    in this paper",
    ", we first formulate the shock reflection - diffraction problem into an initial - boundary value problem in section 2 .",
    "then we employ the essential feature of self - similarity of the initial - boundary value problem to reformulate the problem into a boundary value problem in the unbounded domain in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present the unique solution of normal reflection for this problem when the wedge angle is @xmath3 . in section 5 ,",
    "we exhibit the local theory of regular reflection - diffraction , introduce a stability criterion to determine state ( 2 ) at the reflection point on the wedge , and present the von neumann s detachment and sonic conjectures .",
    "then we discuss the role of the potential flow equation in the shock reflection - diffraction problem even in the level of the full euler equations in section 6 .",
    "based on the local theory , we reduce the boundary value problem into a free boundary problem in the context of potential flow in section 7 . in section 8 , we describe a global theory for regular reflection - diffraction for potential flow , established in chen - feldman @xcite and bae - chen - feldman @xcite . in section 9 ,",
    "we discuss some open problems and new mathematics required for further developments , which are also essential for solving multidimensional problems in conservation laws and other areas in nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the full euler equations for compressible fluids in @xmath4 , are of the following form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density , @xmath7 the fluid velocity , @xmath8 the pressure , and @xmath9 the internal energy .",
    "two other important thermodynamic variables are the temperature @xmath10 and the energy @xmath11 .",
    "the notation @xmath12 denotes the tensor product of the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "choosing @xmath15 as the independent thermodynamical variables , then the constitutive relations can be written as @xmath16 governed by @xmath17    for a polytropic gas , @xmath18 or equivalently , @xmath19 where @xmath20 may be taken to be the universal gas constant divided by the effective molecular weight of the particular gas , @xmath21 is the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath22 is the adiabatic exponent , and @xmath23 is any constant under scaling .    when a flow is potential , that is , there is a velocity potential @xmath24 such that @xmath25 then the euler equations for the flow take the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 especially , @xmath28",
    "when @xmath29 , by scaling and @xmath30 is the bernoulli constant , which is usually determined by the boundary conditions if such conditions are prescribed . from the second equation in , we have @xmath31 then system can be rewritten as the following time - dependent potential flow equation of second order : @xmath32 with .    for a steady solution @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , we obtain the celebrated steady potential flow equation in aerodynamics : @xmath35    in applications in aerodynamics , or is used for discontinuous solutions , and the empirical evidence is that entropy solutions of or are fairly close to entropy solutions for , provided the shock strengths are small , the curvature of shock fronts is not too large , and the amount of vorticity is small in the region of interest .",
    "furthermore , we will show in section 6 that , for the shock reflection - diffraction problem , the euler equations for potential flow is actually _ exact _ in an important region of the solution ( see theorem 6.1 below ) .",
    "then the problem of shock reflection - diffraction by a wedge can be formulated as follows :    .",
    "_ seek a solution of system satisfying the initial condition at @xmath36 : @xmath37 and the slip boundary condition along the wedge boundary : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the exterior unit normal to the wedge boundary , and state @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfy @xmath42 that is , given @xmath43 , and @xmath22 , the other variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 are determined by .",
    "in particular , the mach number @xmath46 is determined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the sonic speed of fluid state @xmath41 . _",
    "notice that the initial - boundary value problem ( * problem 2.1 * ) is invariant under the self - similar scaling : @xmath49 therefore , we seek self - similar solutions : @xmath50 then the self - similar solutions are governed by the following system : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the pseudo - velocity .",
    "the eigenvalues of system are @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the sonic speed .",

    "@xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the simplest case of the shock reflection - diffraction problem is when the wedge angle @xmath0 is @xmath66 . in this case , the reflection - diffraction problem simply becomes the normal reflection problem , for which the incident shock normally reflects , and the reflected shock is also a plane . it can be shown that there exist a _ unique _",

    "various criteria and conjectures have been proposed for the existence of configurations for the patterns ( cf .",
    "ben - dor @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important conjectures made by von neumann @xcite in 1943 is the _ detachment conjecture _ , which states that the regular reflection - diffraction configuration may exist globally whenever the two shock configuration ( one is the incident shock and the other the reflected shock ) exists locally around the point @xmath76 ( see fig .",

    ", the local theory indicates that there are two possible states for state ( 2 ) .",
    "there had been a long debate to determine which one is more physical for the local theory ; see courant - friedrichs @xcite , ben - dor @xcite , and the references cited therein .    since",
    "the reflection - diffraction problem is not a local problem , we take a different point of view that the selection of state ( 2 ) should be determined by the global features of the problem , more precisely , by the stability of the configuration with respect to the wedge angle @xmath0 , rather than the local features of the problem .    : _ since the solution is unique when the wedge angle @xmath84 , it is required that our global regular reflection - diffraction configuration should be stable and converge to the unique normal reflection solution when @xmath85 , provided that such a global configuration can be constructed .",

    "taking into account the _ small _ terms to be added to equation , one needs to make the stronger estimate @xmath249 and assume that @xmath245 is suitably small to control these additional terms .",
    "another issue is the non - variational structure and nonlinearity of this problem which makes it hard to apply directly the approaches of caffarelli @xcite and alt - caffarelli - friedman @xcite .",
    "moreover , the elliptic degeneracy and geometry of the problem makes it difficult to apply the hodograph transform approach in chen - feldman @xcite and kinderlehrer - nirenberg @xcite to fix the free boundary .    for these reasons ,",
    "one of the new ingredients in our approach is to develop further the iteration scheme in @xcite to a partially modified equation .",
    "we modified equation ( [ potential-1 ] ) in @xmath123 by a proper shiffmanization ( i.e. a cutoff ) that depends on the distance to the sonic arc , so that the original and modified equations coincide when @xmath127 satisfies @xmath250 , and the modified equation @xmath251 is elliptic in @xmath123 with elliptic degeneracy on @xmath209 .",
    "then we solved a free boundary problem for this modified equation : the free boundary is the curve @xmath196 , and the free boundary conditions on @xmath196 are @xmath202 and the rankine - hugoniot condition ( [ fbconditionselfsim-0 ] ) .    on each step , an _ iteration free boundary _",

    "then we proved that @xmath127 is in fact @xmath128 up to the boundary @xmath126 , especially @xmath257 , by using the nonlinear structure of elliptic degeneracy near @xmath126 which is modeled by equation ( [ degenerate - equation ] ) and a scaling technique similar to daskalopoulos - hamilton @xcite and lin - wang @xcite .",

    "we remark that the solutions established in @xcite satisfy the assumptions of theorem 8.5 .",
    "in particular , we proved that the @xmath128-regularity is _ optimal _ for the solution across the open part @xmath310 of the sonic arc ( the degenerate elliptic curve ) and at the point @xmath296 where the sonic circle meets the reflected shock ( as a free boundary ) .    to achieve the optimal regularity ,",
    "one of the main difficulties is that the sonic arc @xmath126 is the transonic boundary separating the elliptic region from the hyperbolic region , near where the solution is governed by the nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation for @xmath241 .",
    "we carefully analyzed the features of equation and established the @xmath311 regularity of solutions in the elliptic region up to the open sonic arc @xmath310 .",
    "as a corollary , we showed that the @xmath128-regularity is actually optimal across the transonic boundary @xmath312 from the elliptic to hyperbolic region .",
    "since the reflected shock @xmath312 is regarded as a free boundary connecting the hyperbolic region ( 1 ) with the elliptic region @xmath123 for the nonlinear second - order equation of mixed type , another difficulty for the optimal regularity of the solution is that the point @xmath296 is exactly the point where the degenerate elliptic arc @xmath310 meets a transonic free boundary for the nonlinear partial differential equation of second order . as far as we know , this is the first optimal regularity result for solutions to a free boundary problem of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations at the point where an elliptic degenerate curve meets the free boundary . to achieve this ,",
    "we carefully constructed two sequences of points on where the corresponding sequences of values of @xmath313 have different limits at @xmath296 ; this has been done by employing the one - sided @xmath311 regularity of the solution up to the open arc @xmath310 and by studying detailed features of the free boundary conditions on the free boundary @xmath312 , i.e. , the rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "we remark that some efforts were also made mathematically for the reflection - diffraction problem via simplified models .",
    "one of these models , the unsteady transonic small - disturbance ( utsd ) equation , was derived and used in keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , hunter @xcite , and morawetz @xcite for asymptotic analysis of shock reflection - diffraction . also see zheng @xcite for the pressure gradient equation and canic - keyfitz - kim @xcite for the utsd equation and the nonlinear wave system .",
    "furthermore , in order to deal with the reflection - diffraction problem , some asymptotic methods have been also developed .",
    "lighthill @xcite studied shock reflection - diffraction under the assumption that the wedge angle is either very small or close to @xmath66 .",
    "keller - blank @xcite , hunter - keller @xcite , harabetian @xcite , and gamba - rosales - tabak @xcite considered the problem under the assumption that the shock is so weak that its motion can be approximated by an acoustic wave . for a weak incident shock and a wedge with small angle for potential flow , by taking the jump of the incident shock as a small parameter , the nature of the shock reflection - diffraction pattern was explored in morawetz @xcite by a number of different scalings , a study of mixed equations , and matching the asymptotics for the different scalings .",
    "also see chen @xcite for a linear approximation of shock reflection - diffraction when the wedge angle is close to @xmath66 and serre @xcite for an apriori analysis of solutions of shock reflection - diffraction and related discussions in the context of the euler equations for isentropic and adiabatic fluids .",
    "another related recent effort has been on various important physical problems in steady potential flow , as well as steady fully euler flow , for which great progress has been made .",
    "the problems for global subsonic flow past an obstacle and for local supersonic flow past an obstacle with sharp head are classical , due to the works of shiffman @xcite , bers @xcite , finn - gilbarg @xcite , dong @xcite , and others for the pure elliptic case and to the works of gu @xcite , shaeffer @xcite , li @xcite , and others for the pure hyperbolic case .",
    "recent progress has been made on transonic flow past nozzles ( e.g. @xcite ) , transonic flow past a wedge or conical body ( e.g. @xcite ) , and transonic flow past a smooth obstacle ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also see @xcite for the existence of global subsonic - sonic flow , @xcite for global supersonic flow past an obstacle with sharp head , and the references cited therein .",
    "for some of other recent related developments , we refer the reader to chen @xcite for the local stability of mach configuration , elling - liu @xcite for physicality of weak prandtl - meyer reflection for supersonic potential flow around a ramp , serre @xcite for multidimensional shock interaction for a chaplygin gas , canic - keyfitz - kim @xcite for semi - global solutions for the shock reflection problem , glimm - ji - li - li - zhang - zhang - zheng @xcite for the formation of a transonic shock in a rarefaction riemann problem for polytropic gases , zheng @xcite for various solutions to some two - dimensional riemann problems , gues - mtivier - williams - zumbrun @xcite and benzoni - gavage and serre @xcite for revisits of the local stability of multidimensional shocks and phase boundaries , among many others .",
    "as we have seen from the previous discussion , the shock reflection - diffraction problem involves several core challenging difficulties that we have to face in the study of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "these nonlinear difficulties include _ free boundary problems , oblique derivative problems for nonsmooth domains , degenerate elliptic equations , degenerate hyperbolic equations , transport equations with rough coefficients , mixed and/or composite equations of hyperbolic - elliptic type , behavior of solutions when a free boundary meets an elliptic degenerate curve , and compressible vortex sheets_. more efficient numerical methods are also required for further understanding of shock reflection - diffraction phenomena .    furthermore , the wave patterns of shock reflection - diffraction configurations are the core patterns and configurations for the global solutions of the two - dimensional riemann problem ; these solutions are building blocks and local structure of general entropy solutions and determine global attractors and asymptotic states of entropy solutions , as time goes infinity , for two - dimensional systems of hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "therefore , a successful solution to the shock reflection - diffraction problem not only provides our understanding of shock reflection - diffraction phenomena and behavior of entropy solutions to multidimensional conservation laws , but also provides important new ideas , insights , techniques , and approaches for our developments of more efficient analytical techniques and methods to overcome the core challenging difficulties in multidimensional problems in conservation laws and other areas in nonlinear partial differential equations .",
