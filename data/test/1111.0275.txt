    "in quantum chromodynamics , quarks are fundamental particles carrying fractional electric charges",
    ". however , interactions between quarks grows linearly with distance due to the mechanism of confinement arising from the @xmath2 color gauge theory .",
    "consequentially , quarks are confined into color singlet bound states of baryons and mesons , and thus are difficult to observe . in various condensed matter systems , there also exist excitations carrying fractional quantum numbers , such as the spinon and holon excitations in 1d luttinger liquids @xcite , the solitons with half - fermion charge in one dimensional conducting polymers @xcite , and the quasi - particle and hole excitations in fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , and the monomer excitations in the dimer model in the triangular lattice @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "fractional excitations are deconfined .",
    "some of them have been experimentally detected .",
    "the phenomenon of confinement emerges in quasi-1d strongly correlated systems such as spin ladders .",
    "the `` quark '' in this case is known as spinon , which is the domain wall interpolating between different ordered regions and usually carries fractionalized spin ( spin-@xmath3 ) .",
    "take an antiferromagnetic spin chain with ising - like exchange anisotropy for an example , the ground state in this case would be a neel state with two - fold degeneracy , while the spinon can be considered as the elementary excitation separating these two degenerate ground states with opposite staggered magnetization . in a single spin chain ,",
    "no confinement occurs because a pair of spinons could be separated as far from each other as possible without costing energy . for a two - leg ladder system ,",
    "even an infinitesimal interchain coupling would induce a potential which increases linearly with distance between the spinons @xcite .",
    "therefore a pair of fractionalized spinon excitations would be confined into an integral spin-1 excitation : a magnon .",
    "recently , a finite temperature confined - deconfined crossover has been observed in neutron scattering experiments for a weakly coupled ladder material cacu@xmath4o@xmath5@xcite . the signature of the confinement of spinons can be observed from the energy absorption spectrum for spin - flips at various wavevectors . in this paper , we reexamine this old concept from a novel perspective , which enables us to visualize the confinement directly through the non - equilibrium dynamics in a cold atom system",
    ".    due to the low dissipation rate and the long coherence times , ultracold atoms in optical lattices have opened exciting possibilities for studying non - equilibrium quantum dynamics of many - body systems @xcite . on the other hand",

    "our departure point is a two - leg spin-@xmath0 ladder with easy axis anisotropy along the @xmath11-axis defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the leg index ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the couplings along the leg and across the rung , respectively .",

    "the experimental realization of eq.([eq : ham ] ) in ultra - cold atom systems will be discussed later .",
    "below we will focus on the case of @xmath17 which gives rise to the nontrivial dynamics induced by spinon confinement .    because of the ising anisotropy and the ferromagnetic rung coupling , the ground state is a neel state within each leg and with the spins of each rung aligned as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "the transverse spin couplings @xmath19 generate spinon dynamics . in the absence of the rung coupling , two spinons move independently with velocities @xmath20 @xcite . in the case of @xmath21 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 propagate with different velocities , thus becomes apart eventually .",
    "the effective potential between spinons is known as @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average distance between these two spinon ; @xmath24 is the lattice constant ; @xmath25 is taken over the ground state .     with the spinon positions marked by the red cross .",

    ", width=321 ]    now we turn on the coupling along the rung , a confinement potential emerges between two spinons .",
    "it acts like a `` constant '' force connecting these two spinons .",
    "if we view the spinons as particles , the dynamics of the spinons can be qualitatively understood from a simple two - body picture as follows .",
    "two particles with different initial velocities and masses move in a 1d lattice system and interact with each other via a linear potential .",
    "each particle oscillates around the center of mass ( com ) of the system , which continues to do uniform linear motion until it reaches the boundary .",
    "this simple picture could be verified qualitatively by our numerical simulation of the spinon dynamics .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "an oscillation of the @xmath8 is observed , while that of @xmath9 is not as clear as @xmath8 .",
    "the effective mass of @xmath9 is larger than that of @xmath8 , thus its oscillation amplitude is too small to be visible .    to further verify the two - particle picture quantitatively , we choose @xmath42 , which means @xmath9",
    "is localized in its initial position at the boundary . in this case",
    ", the two - body problem reduces to a one - body problem of @xmath8 in a lattice system under a static magnetic field , which is provided by the rectified spins in the second leg .",
    "the time evolution of a spinon within a ferromagnetic spin chain under a constant magnetic field has been studied previously , the dynamics turns out to be a perfect bloch oscillation @xcite . in our case , the confinement constant force provided by the static @xmath9 plays a similar role of the constant electric field ( @xmath43 ) , and we expect a similar bloch oscillation dynamics .",
    "it implies that the frequency of the oscillation of @xmath8 should be proportional to the interaction strength : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the oscillation period",
    ". this relation can be verify numerically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we can find a linear relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "simulation times were long enough to observe the stability of the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "@xmath47 with parameter values of @xmath42 , and @xmath48 ( squares ) or @xmath49 ( circles ) . ]    in a perfect bloch oscillation , the frequency is determined by the strength of the external field ( @xmath47 in our case ) , and should be independent of the band width ( @xmath50 in our case ) .",
    "however , we find that the oscillation frequency not only depends on @xmath47 , but is also slightly dependent on @xmath50 , especially for large values of @xmath47 .",
    "there are two possible factors contributing to the imperfection of bloch oscillation .",
    "one is the boundary effect .",
    "considering the quantum nature of spinons ( wave packets ) , the boundary begin to influence the dynamics even before the centers of spinons reach the boundary . for larger @xmath47 ,",
    "the amplitude of the bloch oscillation @xmath51 is smaller ( @xmath52 ) , which indicates the motion of the @xmath8 is confined to the boundary , therefore the boundary effect becomes more obvious .",
    "this can explain why the deviation becomes larger for bigger @xmath53 .",
    "the other reason comes from deviations from the linear relations of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , which can be considered as a zero - order approximation of the exact interaction between spinons . actually , on a long length scale , it is possible that higher order nonlinear modifications such as @xmath54 emerge due to the quantum nature of spinons @xcite .",
    "for an experimental realization of our two - leg spin ladder system in an ultracold atomic superlattice system , one first has to create neel - ordered chains along the @xmath55-direction @xcite , for example by using @xmath1rb atoms with two internal spin states @xmath56 . the necessary superexchange interactions of the ultra cold atoms can be achieved by the use of a superlattice system @xcite . in the optical lattice ,",
    "a typical energy scale for the superexchange coupling @xmath57 is in the order of khz , which implies a @xmath58 time - scale real - time dynamics in our case . by modifying the bias between neighboring lattice sites , both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction",
    "can be realized @xcite ; the orientation of the setup would be as shown in fig .",
    "the two - leg ladder structure is achievable by applying another laser along the @xmath59-direction to construct a second superlattice structure .",
    "in addition , the easy - axis anisotropy is realizable by tuning the interaction @xmath60 @xcite or by a periodically modulated lattice @xcite .",
    "local addressing techniques as developed recently @xcite would be used to create domain walls , e.g. by a global spin - flip on one half of the system , as well as for the read - out procedure .",
    "these techniques , while advanced , are now experimentally established .",
    "the arguably most difficult part of the experiment would be to adjust the exchange interaction separately along two different legs .",
    "as mentioned above , the exchange interaction can be adjusted by superlattices @xcite , but to do this separately on legs 1 and 2 , an additional superlattice structure is needed .",
    "in fact , antiferromagnetic spin chains have already successfully been simulated , albeit in a different context , namely the bose - hubbard model in a tilted optical lattices , where a magnetic domain wall has been observed @xcite .",
    "in the context of condensed matter physics , the study of domain wall motion in magnetic nanowires has attracted considerable theoretical and experimental attentions recently due to its potential industrial applications .",
    "manipulation and control the domain wall dynamics in magnetic nanowires is known to play an important role in nanomagnetism @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies in this field are based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite .",
    "our work is different from previous work in three aspects : ( i ) we provide a quasi - exact calculation of the dynamics of the strongly correlated system by tebd instead of a semi - classic mean - field approximation ; ( ii ) different from condensed matter system where the domain wall dynamics is closely related with dissipation rate , there is little energy dissipation in our system ; ( iii ) we account for the strong confined interaction between domain walls , which leads to nontrivial dynamics .    whether in condensed matter or ultracold atom physics , the control and manipulation of the particles or quasiparticles in the quantum system are of central interest . in this paper",
    ", confinement is visualized in real space and its properties are studied via a non - equilibrium process , showing a possible way to investigate and manipulate the motion and interaction of quasiparticles in a dissipationless strongly correlated system",
