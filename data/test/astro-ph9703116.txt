    "the helix ( ngc  7293 , pk  3657.1 ) is the nearest planetary nebula ( pn ) with a massive molecular envelope ( huggins et al .",
    "1996 ) . at a distance of @xmath8160  pc ( e.g. , cahn et al .",
    "1992 ) it affords the best opportunity to explore in detail the relation between neutral and ionized gas in an evolved nebula .",
    "molecular gas in the helix forms a large broken ring surrounding the ionized cavity ( healy & huggins 1986 ; cox et al . , in preparation ) , and its mass is at least 0.03 , or @xmath9% of the total nebular mass ( huggins & healy 1986 ) .",
    "high - resolution observations show that the molecular gas is fragmented into numerous substructures ( forveille & huggins 1991 ) , some of which survive within the ionized cavity and are seen as the well known cometary globules ( huggins et al .",
    "hst studies of these remarkable structures have been reported by odell & handron ( 1996 ) .",
    "the molecular gas in pn is exposed to strong uv radiation from the central star which is expected to establish photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) with an important component of atomic gas at the interface with the ionized gas .",
    "a characteristic of such regions is emission in the ground state @xmath1 fine structure line of neutral atomic carbon at 609  @xmath10 .",
    "this line has been detected in the young pn ngc  7027 ( young et al .",
    ", in preparation ) where ci is found to be a minor constituent .",
    "it has also been detected in the ring nebula ( bachiller et al.1994 ) where the abundance of ci exceeds that of co , although the detailed structure of the gas is not resolved .    in this letter",
    "we report the detection of the 609  @xmath0 ci line in the helix .",
    "the observations , made towards the position of peak co emission , reveal multiple , narrow ( 12 ) ci components which we unambigouly associate with the globules through mapping the components in co. the observations show that ci is a major constituent of the neutral gas in the globules .",
    "the observations were made using the 10.4  m telescope of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "the region observed lies on the western limb of the ionized nebula and corresponds to the position of peak co emission ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the observations include deep integrations at the field center in ci , co(21 ) , and @xmath2co(21 ) , and mapping of the region in co(21 ) to determine the local structure of the  gas .",
    "the ci observations at 609  @xmath0 ( 492 ghz ) were obtained in july 1996 in excellent weather conditions .",
    "the ssb system temperature ( @xmath11 ) of the receiver was typically @xmath12k , and the spectrometer s resolution was 1 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the beam size at 492  ghz was @xmath13 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we checked pointing by mapping co(43 ) in the nearby star ep aqr and found its error to be @xmath14 .",
    "a chopping secondary mirror was used to observe 2 reference positions @xmath15 from the source in azimuth .",
    "observations were taken only when the source was near transit to ensure that the reference positions were locations previously found to be free of co emission .",
    "we also obtained co(21 ) and @xmath2co(21 ) spectra at the position observed in ci and mapped a region of 135@xmath3 around this position in co(21 ) with 15@xmath16 spacing .",
    "for these observations @xmath11 was @xmath17 k , and the spectrometer s resolution was @xmath80.1  km  s@xmath4 . all intensities in this letter are in units of main beam temperature .",
    "the ci , co and @xmath2co spectra are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the three spectra are characterized by multiple velocity components , most clearly seen in the co spectrum .",
    "there are at least five separate components at velocities between @xmath1828 and @xmath189 , and additional , weaker components around @xmath1830  and possibly @xmath186 .",
    "the strongest components can be identified in all three spectra .    to characterize the spectra , we made multi - gaussian fits to the data .",
    "for the co spectrum , we fit the five main components with the velocities ( @xmath19 ) , intensities ( @xmath20 ) , and linewidths ( @xmath21 ) as free parameters .",
    "these values for @xmath19 and @xmath21 were then used for the fits to the @xmath2co and ci spectra .",
    "the results are given in table 1 which lists the velocity , linewidth , and the velocity integrated line intensities ( @xmath22 ) for each of the components ( labeled a to e for reference ) .",

    "the co emission is seen to extend along a south - east north - west direction and shows a complex structure .",
    "the emission shows peaks at different positions in different channel maps , indicating that the distribution of matter is characterized by small globules or clumps which have a typical velocity dispersion @xmath23 and are unresolved or partially resolved by the 30  beam .",
    "most of the components identified in the spectra in fig .",
    "2 can be associated with discrete structures in the channel maps .",
    "thus the bulk of the co and the ci emission is localized within the neutral globules .",
    "we first discuss interpretation of the observed lines in terms of column densities , using the simplifying assumptions of low optical depth and lte .",
    "the recent study of molecular gas in pn , including the helix , by bachiller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicates a relatively low opacity for the co lines and provides an estimate for the excitation temperature of @xmath24 k , based on the ratio of the 2@xmath181 and 1@xmath180 lines of @xmath2co .",
    "the low intensity of the ci line and the similarity of the levels to the low lying co lines suggests that these results are also appropriate for ci . for @xmath24",
    "k , the ci and co column densities ( in @xmath7 ) are related to the integrated intensities of the observed lines ( in k ) by the expressions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these relations are not very sensitive to @xmath27 , and vary by less than a factor of 2 over the range 1080  k.    estimated column densities are given in table  1 together with the ci / co column density ratio and the @xmath28 ratio .",
    "these results show that the characteristics of the globules are remarkably uniform : the @xmath29c/@xmath2c value is @xmath30 , and the column density in ci is systematically higher than that of co by a factor of @xmath31 .    -0.95truecm",
    "-1truecm      the large abundance of ci that we find in the helix demonstrates that atomic carbon is an important component of the envelope s neutral gas .",
    "this is likely caused in part by the radiation field of the central star which will develop pdrs in the neutral gas .",
    "the material observed lies along the ionization front in the dark / extinguished area of the optical nebula ( see fig .  1 ) and the morphology of the gas ( fig .",
    "3 ) indicates a very broken structure which is probably permeated by the stellar radiation .",
    "the c / o ratio in the helix has not been measured but there is considerable evidence that it is carbon rich .",
    "howe et al . (",
    "1994 ) have constructed chemical models of the globules and find that the abundance of ci is predicted to be roughly the same as that of co for a large range in optical depths if c / o@xmath321 .",
    "this is consistent with our observations . for the case",
    "with c / o@xmath331 , however , the abundance of ci is predicted to be much less than co , which is not observed , indicating that the helix is a c - rich nebula .",
    "additional evidence comes from the similarity of the molecular abundances in the helix with other c - rich nebulae measured by bachiller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and the presence of pah emission ( cox et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the globules sizes determined from the channel maps are typically @xmath34 or 7  @xmath35 in units of @xmath36  cm ( at 160  pc ) .",
    "their masses can be estimated from the observed lines by adopting an abundance ratio for co or c. estimates of the mass of _ molecular gas _ in the globules can be made assuming all the oxygen is in co , i.e. , co / h = o / h which is measured to be 3@xmath510@xmath37 in the ionized gas ( kaler et al .",
    "1990 ) . using the same assumptions on the opacity and temperature as before , the beam averaged column densities of hydrogen ( in hi and h@xmath38 ) are @xmath3910@xmath40  @xmath7 for clumps a , b , c , and e , and the masses are typically 1 - 3  @xmath510@xmath41  m@xmath42 for each clump .",
    "we note that component d corresponds to material at the edge of a co layer , which could explain its lower n(ci)/n(co ) ratio .",
    "the average value of the ci / co ratio of @xmath31 that we find means that the above mass estimates based on the molecular observations are lower limits to the total mass of _",
    "neutral gas_. adopting a nominal c / o ratio of 1.2 ( as in the ring nebula - see bachiller et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) , the corresponding mass of neutral gas of each clump will be about 10@xmath37  m@xmath42 . taking the total number of clumps over the entire surface of the nebula estimated to be 3000 by odell & handron ( 1996 ) and assuming that they are similar to the clumps described in this paper , we derive a total mass of neutral gas of 0.4  m@xmath42 in the helix .",
    "this is an order of magnitude greater than the estimate published by huggins & healy ( 1986 ) .",
    "this number could be overestimated because clumps inside the ionized cavity are known to have smaller masses of typically 5@xmath510@xmath43  m@xmath42 ( huggins et al .",
    "1992 ) . on the other hand , taking into account the contribution of the cii 158  @xmath0 fine structure line which is likely to be present in the neutral gas will increase the above mass estimate .",
    "work in progress will explore the cii content in the helix nebula . in any case , it is clear that the mass of the neutral gas in the helix represents a significant fraction , perhaps up to 50% , of the total nebular mass .",
    "comparable results were found for the ring nebula by bachiller et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . which is in a similar evolutionary status to the helix .",
    "the large abundance of ci in the helix is very different from that found at earlier stages of evolution .",
    "ci has not been detected in any envelopes of agb stars except irc+10216 , which has only a small amount of ci in the outer envelope ( keene et al .",
    "the young pn ngc  7027 has a larger ci content ( about 1/2 that of co in the inner envelope ) associated with the pdr surrounding the compact ionized nebula ( young et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this is consistent with the ionizing front gradually etching out the molecular envelope ejected during the agb phase .",
    "further evolution is seen in the helix and ring ( bachiller et al . 1994 ) nebulae , where vast amounts of ci are detected .",
    "evidence that such an evolution has taken place inside the helix is also suggested by the difference in mass between the globules seen in the ionized cavity and those of the outer molecular envelope .",
    "the mass of molecular gas derived for the globules in the envelope are about a factor 26 times bigger than the mass estimates for the cometary globules which lie inside the ionized cavity of the helix ( huggins et al .",
    "this difference can be understood in the general picture wherein the ionization front overtakes clumps already present in the molecular envelope and photoionizes their surface layers . as they are gradually etched away",
    ", the dense molecular core will become smaller , and the remains , if any , will probably resemble the clumps detected in the ionized region .",
    "we note that this evolutionary picture is fully consistent with the results of the recent co survey by huggins et al .",
    "these observations places important constraints on the properties of the neutral gas in the helix nebula .",
    "the mapping observations show that the structure of the gas on the periphery of the ionized nebula is highly fragmented , leading naturally to the formation of cometary globules in the ionized cavity .",
    "our observations show that ci is the major form of atomic carbon in the neutral gas of the helix , and probably dominates the cooling of the gas .",
    "the ci results also indicate that the helix is a carbon - rich nebula .",
    "the total mass of neutral gas in the helix is derived to be of the order 0.4  m@xmath42 , an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates .",
    "the present findings are in agreement with current ideas on the evolution from the agb phase to fully evolved pn , during which the neutral envelope ejected in the agb phase is gradually photodissociated and photoionized by the radiation field of the hot central star .",
