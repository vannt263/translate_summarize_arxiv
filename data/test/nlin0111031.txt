    "another necessary ingredient for the occurrence of fingers are density - driven convective currents in front of the growing deposit : if convection is suppressed by turning the electrodeposition cell in a vertical configuration , fingers are not longer formed @xcite .",
    "for that reason it appears to be essential to understand the nature of the convection field in our experiment , which we examine using particle image velocimetry ( piv ) .",

    "we used particles with 0.3 @xmath5 m diameter , which stay suspended due to brownian motion . since we can not resolve these particles with our optical system , we used dark - field microscopy : only light scattered from objects inside the cell falls into the lens .",

    "the decrease of @xmath28 could originate from a change of the physicochemical properties of the copper hydrogel .",
    "negative `` growth rates '' can only be measured if the initial amplitude of the corresponding mode is strong enough . to enforce this",
    "we prepared a textured electrode which stimulates the initial growth at a wavenumber of 62.8 @xmath32 .",
    "it consists of a synthetic substrate of 120 @xmath5 m height with a 35 @xmath5 m copper plating .",

    "our results provide a reasonable explanation why in the absence of gravity - driven convection rolls the fingering instability can not be observed : without convective mixing , the concentration gradient at the hydrogel interface can be assumed to be steeper , which will increases the effective surface tension . in consequence @xmath28 shifts to smaller wavenumbers and",
    "the overall growth rates decrease , which will suppress the evolution of fingers .",
    "an alternative explanation assumes two zones within the hydrogel layer .",
    "one part of the hydrogel in immediate vicinity of the deposit will be mixed by the convection roll and the consequential shear thinning will decrease its viscosity . in front of it",
    "there is a zone of quiescent hydrogel of higher viscosity , at the interface between this two the instability takes place . in this scenario @xmath28",
