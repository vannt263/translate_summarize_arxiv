    "shape memory alloys [ sma ] are materials having many applications and attracting a lot of interest due to their unique properties of shape memory and pseudoelasticity , which stem from both temperature - induced and stress - induced martensitic phase transition .",
    "the mechanical behaviour of such materials is rather complex and arises from a strong interaction between thermal and mechanical phenomena .",
    "in fact , when these materials undergo the martensitic phase transition , the increase in temperature due to localised self - heating / self - cooling has been experimentally found to be anything but negligible @xcite . hence , the effects of heat transfer and of the heat dissipation towards the ambient are of primary relevance in the study of these materials @xcite and play a role in the rate - dependent behaviour of sma @xcite .    in modelling the mechanical behaviour of a sma",
    "it is therefore important to account for mechanical and thermal aspects at the same time and to evaluate all the phenomena in their time evolution .    in literature there",
    "exist many constitutive models for sma @xcite , which are derived following different approaches .",
    "some authors propose models developed within plasticity frameworks , which make use of one or even more internal variables to describe the pseudo - elastic behaviour @xcite .",
    "another group of constitutive models has been developed within a thermomechanic context ; in his work , tanaka @xcite proposed a macroscale model comprising an internal variable to quantify the extent of the phase transition , a dissipation potential and an assumed transformation kinetic .",
    "similarly , other models based on the same thermodynamic background but featuring different kinetic laws have been formulated @xcite , and a complete heat equation which accounts for the contribution of latent heat and of the dissipation connected with the phase transition was added to the framework @xcite . among others ,",
    "chang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a model comprising a strain - gradient elastic free energy and a chemical ( transitional ) free energy ; abeyaratne et al .",
    "@xcite developed a model including a non - convex helmholtz free energy function of the strain in order to describe the regions of stability of the different phases . in the context of using a non - convex free energy , it is not uncommon that micro - mechanical models are proposed @xcite ; muller and seelecke @xcite developed a microscale model based on statistical physics comprising a bulk free energy function of the lattice shear deformation .",
    "another approach to the description of the behaviour of sma consists in applying the ginzburg - landau theory for phase transitions . at a microscopic scale ,",
    "falk @xcite developed a landau theory based on a shear strain order parameter .",
    "levitas and preston @xcite proposed a single - grain model based on the decomposition of the strain in an elastic and a transformational part , the latter being described by a pure order parameter which can assume different values to identify the different phases . in a similar fashion , wang and khachaturyan @xcite proposed a model in which the strain field depends on several order parameters , whose evolution is described by several time - dependent ginzburg - landau [ tdgl ] equations .",
    "nevertheless , attempts to handle the problem at a larger scale of observation have been made as well . among others ,",
    "ahluwalia et al .",
    "@xcite and chen and yang @xcite proposed meso - scale models for the description of polycrystalline materials in which the order parameters account for the different orientations of each single grain ; in the same spirit , brocca et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a microplane model attempting to bridge the gap between micromechanics - based and macroscale models .",
    "berti et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a ginzburg - landau model which can be applied at the macroscale and encompasses mechanical as well as thermal effects by introducing the balance of linear momentum equation and the heat equation in a thermodynamically consistent framework ; the order parameter is related to the extent of the phase transition between austenite and the martensite variants and its evolution is regulated by a tdgl equation .",
    "owing to the presence of the heat equation , it is possible to describe the thermo - mechanical interactions which strongly influence the constitutive behaviour of a sma and to account for non - isothermal conditions .",
    "the model is presented both in a three - dimensional and a monodimensional setting ; the reduction to this latter case is still meaningful because in most engineering applications sma wires are employed .    in this paper",
    ", we present a numerical study on the thermomechanical behaviour of a sma , with a particular focus on the rate - dependent response and on the influence of thermal conduction and heat transfer in the mechanical behaviour .",
    "starting from the models proposed in berti et al .",
    "@xcite and daghia et al .",
    "@xcite , we formulate a new free energy functional and give a proper expression for the relaxation parameter regulating the tdgl equation ; this gives the model the properties required to reproduce the symmetrical behaviour between the austenite - to - martensite and the martensite - to - austenite phase transitions observed experimentally .",
    "the ability of the model to quantitatively reproduce a variety of experimental evidences of a typical polycrystalline niti alloy is then demonstrated .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [",
    "sect : model ] , the theoretical model is described , starting from a suitable ginzburg - landau free energy whose properties are outlined in section [ sect : gl - pot ] .",
    "constitutive relations are given in section [ sect : constit ] , while the thermodynamic consistency of the model is shown in section [ sect : consistency ] and the complete differential system with appropriate boundary and initial conditions is provided in section [ sect : equations ] . in section [",
    "sect : galerkin ] the galerkin formulation of the differential problem , suitable for the finite element implementation , is sketched .",
    "section [ sect : num - tests ] is the main part of the paper , where the numerical results of a number of simulated tensile tests on a bar specimen under different conditions are reported . after describing , in section [ sect : baseline ] ,",
    "the effectiveness of the model in recovering the main experimental evidences in terms of stress - strain response , phase morphology and temperature evolution , in section [ sect : temp - test ] tensile tests performed at different values of the initial temperature are illustrated , while in section [ sect : max - def ] the stress - strain response under partial - loading conditions is depicted .",
    "the rate - dependent behaviour of the model is investigated in section [ sect : strain - rate ] , with a particular focus on the effects of the strain - rate on the domain nucleation , the hysteresis cycle and the energy dissipation .",
    "the influence of heat transfer phenomena on the mechanical response of the specimen is examined in section [ sect : environment ] .",
    "the last two aspects are considered jointly in section [ sect : env - rate ] .",
    "the paper ends drawing some conclusions in section [ sect : concl ] .",
    "the thermomechanical properties of sma stem from the nature of the martensitic phase transition ; here we will account for it by means of a ginzburg - landau approach @xcite . to this end",
    "we have to define a phase field , or order parameter , @xmath0 ; differently from the approach followed , among others , by falk @xcite , the order parameter is not identified with the uniaxial strain @xmath1 , but rather the phase field @xmath0 is used here as a macroscopic indicator of the phase ( martensite or austenite ) of the material at every point @xcite .",
    "strain is an independent field , though it is coupled with the order parameter .",
    "we assume that the martensite phase be present in only two relevant variants , @xmath2 , characterised by opposite uniaxial transformation strains with respect to the austenite phase [ a ] , namely @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a fixed direction .",
    "the ginzburg - landau potential , whose properties will be described in detail in section [ sect : gl - pot ] , is expressly formulated to have ( at most ) three stable values of @xmath0 at values @xmath5 , corresponding to phases @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we remark that , as a consequence of the _ first order _ character of the martensitic phase transition , intermediate values of @xmath0 do not represent any physically stable phase , but only transition layers between different stable or metastable physical phases .",
    "the model has to encompass evolution equations for the three basic fields : the order parameter ( @xmath0 ) , the strain ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the evolution of the phase field will be described by the tdgl equation @xmath9 the strain will be determined through the combination of the balance of linear momentum equation and a proper constitutive relation between strain , stress and order parameter , while the heat equation regulating the temperature evolution will arise from the balance of energy equation .    for the formulation of the model",
    ", we consider a bar sample of sma occupying a bidimensional material domain @xmath10 .",
    "we indicate with @xmath11 the material coordinates and with @xmath12 the displacement vector field .",
    "relying on the small displacement approximation , we use the linearised strain tensor @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "following berti et al .",
    "@xcite , we assume a ginzburg - landau free energy in the form @xmath14},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the temperature function @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 being @xmath17 the specific heat , @xmath18 a reference temperature for the specific heat , @xmath19 the compliance modulus , @xmath20 the stress tensor , @xmath21 the interface energy parameter regulating the interface width , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 material parameters related to the phase transition whose physical meaning will be explained in the following .",
    "the two potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 } + \\frac{1}{8 } { \\left [ { 1 - \\cos { \\left ( { 2 \\pi { \\varphi } } \\right ) } } \\right]},\\\\    g({\\varphi } ) & = & 1 - \\cos { \\left ( { \\pi { \\varphi } } \\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the stress - strain diagrams referring to the tests performed at different strain rates for the values of the heat transfer coefficient @xmath29 and @xmath30 are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : stress - strain - rate - h5 ] and [ fig : stress - strain - rate - h20 ] , respectively , together with the maximum number of martensite nuclei originated during the loading stage .",
    "the behaviour is the same described in section [ sect : strain - rate ] for the case @xmath31 .",
    "a ginzburg - landau model that reproduces the most relevant macroscopic features of the behaviour of a shape memory alloy has been considered .",
    "the model encompasses a time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation for the evolution of the phase order parameter , the balance of linear momentum and the heat equation , in order to account for the interplay between the transitional , mechanical and thermal aspects which strongly influences the behaviour of sma . starting from the theoretical model described in berti et al .",
    "@xcite , a new free energy based on trigonometric functions has been formulated and a suitable form of the relaxation parameter of the tdgl equation has been proposed .",
    "the resulting properties of the model ensure the driving force for the phase transition from austenite to martensite to be equal to the driving force for the transition from martensite to austenite and , consequently , provide a symmetrical behaviour of the model upon loading and unloading .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the mechanical response of the model ; tensile tests on a bar specimen have been simulated under different conditions by changing the initial temperature , the maximum imposed strain , the nominal imposed strain - rate and the environmental conditions .",
    "the results obtained illustrate that the model is able to reproduce the main experimental evidences reported in literature @xcite .",
    "the simulated tensile tests show the presence of a stress drop during the phase nucleation , which may be absent in the unloading stage if the loading is interrupted before the completion of the phase transition ; temperature profiles consistent with the observed physical phenomena have also been described .",
    "the effect of the strain - rate on the mechanical response of the model have been investigated ; its impact on the number of nucleating domains , the nucleation stress , the stress relaxation during nucleation and on the slope of the stress plateau ( strain - hardening ) have been recovered .",
    "the role of the environmental conditions in the mechanical response have also been examined , and the concurrent influence of heat transfer conditions and strain - rate on the damping capacity and on the overall behaviour of the model have been described .",
