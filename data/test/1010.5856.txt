    "recently considerable effort has been devoted to understand the isospin physics because of its paramount importance in determining the structure and dynamics of finite nuclei @xcite and also in the astrophysical contexts such as supernova dynamics , protoneutron star evolutions and the structure and properties of neutron star @xcite . in stable nuclei , the neutron - proton asymmetry , @xmath0 , is about 0.2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the neutron and proton number densities . in forthcoming rare - isotope accelerator experiments",
    "the magnitude of @xmath3 could be well above 0.24 .",
    "in contrast , a large @xmath4 is reached in the dense interior of neutron stars @xcite . whereas , very small asymmetry of @xmath5 is attained near the crust of ( proto)neutron stars at densities @xmath6-@xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite . in order to understand",
    "the composition and structure of stars over this extreme values of density and asymmetry requires precise knowledge of the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy @xmath9 .",
    "several theoretical studies have demonstrated @xcite that @xmath9 represents the leading coefficient of an expansion of the total energy , @xmath10 ) , for a neutron - rich system with respect to asymmetry : @xmath11 .",
    "the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state , @xmath12 , has been already well constrained over a wide density range from analysis of a large body of data within non - relativistic models @xcite and relativistic models @xcite . in contrast , though the nuclear symmetry energy at the normal nuclear matter density @xmath13 @xmath8 is well constrained to @xmath14 mev , its value and trend at lower and especially at higher densities are poorly known @xcite .",
    "various theoretical calculations based on microscopic @xcite and/or phenomenological many - body approaches @xcite , though reproduce the well - constrained value of @xmath15 , their high density predictions of symmetry energy are extremely diverse . while certain models predict a monotonically increasing symmetry energy with density , other model results show that @xmath9 increases initially up to about @xmath16 and decreases thereafter .",
    "these diverse predictions in the density dependence in the symmetry energy lead to large uncertainty in the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter which mainly stems due to insufficient knowledge about the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions .",
    "recently some progress has been achieved by consistently constraining the symmetry energy to @xmath17 at subsaturation densities from analysis of isospin diffusion @xcite and isoscaling @xcite data in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions and from the study of neutron skin of several nuclei @xcite . within a relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model @xcite",
    ", the symmetry energy has been constrained to a small range @xcite from analysis of neutron skin thickness of several nuclei across the periodic table .",
    "further , the slope parameter and the incompressibility for the constrained @xmath9 was found @xcite consistent with that extracted from isospin diffusion and isoscaling data .    in an effort to pindown the precise density dependence of symmetry energy ,",
    "it has been noted @xcite that the skin thickness of neutron - rich heavy nucleus , for example @xmath18pb , are linearly correlated with the symmetry pressure at a density slightly below the normal nuclear matter value .",
    "since the same pressure supports a neutron star at supranormal densities against gravitational collapse , suggests an underlying correlation between neutron skin of heavy nuclei and neutron star radii @xcite . within the rmf models ,",
    "the constrained @xmath9 demonstrated @xcite that the neutron skin in @xmath18pb tend to yield smaller neutron star radii .",
    "furthermore , within the constrained range of symmetry energy , significant sensitivity on several features of liquid - gas phase transition @xcite in hot asymmetric nuclear matter was found @xcite . in particular , the boundary and area of the liquid - gas coexistence region , the maximal isospin asymmetry and the critical values of pressure and isospin asymmetry all of which systematically increase with increasing overall softness of @xmath9 .",
    "it is thus instructive to explore the effects of symmetry energy in the rmf model , that has been limited to a narrow range from analysis of skin data , on the composition and structure of hot protoneutron and cold neutron star matter that encompasses a large density range .",
    "a newly born neutron star or protoneutron star ( pns ) @xcite is formed in the aftermath of a successful supernova explosion and subsequent gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star .",
    "due to short mean free path of neutrinos of @xmath19 cm ( compared to pns radii of about 10 km ) , the neutrinos are trapped temporarily within the neutrino - sphere of the star .",
    "the pns are thus rich in leptons , mostly @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and quite hot with central temperatures of @xmath22 mev .",
    "thus the star matter has the interesting possibility to undergo liquid - gas phase transition close to the surface of the star @xcite , the characteristics of which is mainly controlled by the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities . in the much longer kelvin - helmholtz evolution stage of about 10 sec , the neutrinos escape from the interior , and the hot and lepton - rich pns changes into a cold and deleptonized neutron star .",
    "the loss of neutrinos enforce the electrons and protons to combine resulting in a neutron - rich neutron star matter .",
    "consequently , the symmetry energy at supranormal densities plays an important role in determining the composition , in particular the possible presence of strange hyperons , the structure ( mass and radius ) and the long - term cooling of the neutron star .    in this paper",
    "we study the role of isospin on the liquid - gas phase transition in hot lepton - rich protoneutron star and the properties of ( proto)neutron star within the accurately calibrated parameter set fsugold @xcite in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model .",
    "for this purpose , we restrict the model density dependence of symmetry energy @xmath9 within a narrow range that reproduced the skin thickness of several nuclei @xcite . at the supranormal densities",
    "the contribution of the hyperon degrees of freedom to the equation of state of the star is considered . at very low densities well below the saturation value , that is relevant to the crust",
    ", few - body correlations become important .",

    ", the strongly bound alpha is seen to be the most abundant particle over a wide density range as many - body correlations gain prominence with density . moreover , with increasing temperature , the @xmath172 fraction decreases while other cluster abundances increase ; the peak positions gradually shifting to higher densities . consequently with increasing @xmath114 ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath174 increases and shifts to higher densities and then decreases again at @xmath175 mev when deuterons dominate .",
    "this was also observed in the rmf model with density - dependent couplings @xcite .",
    "note that at a given temperature and density the ( free ) neutron - rich supernova matter has somewhat smaller cluster fractions compared to the symmetric nuclear matter .",

    "figure [ pbound ] shows the boundary for the existence of the coexistence phase at various temperatures in the fsugold model for the isovector coupling @xmath180 .",
    "the results are for electron lepton fraction @xmath181 ( and muon lepton number @xmath86 ) which approximately corresponds to the value at the onset of trapping . at a nucleon density of @xmath182 @xmath8 ,",
    "the critical temperature for @xmath130 is @xmath183 mev which is close to that for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . whereas a softer nuclear symmetry energy @xmath145 at subsaturation density ( @xmath184 ) ,",
    "gives a somewhat smaller @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , the critical temperature divide the coexistence boundary into a low - density gas phase ( on the left ) and a high - density liquid phase ( on the right ) and the liquid - gas phase coexist within the boundary . due to trapping , the net electron concentration is quite high , and the matter at the low baryon density phase is controlled by non - degenerate electrons . as a consequence , the nuclear symmetry energy corresponding to @xmath184 and 0.03 has practically no effect on the gas phase boundary . on the other hand , due to dominant contribution of the degenerate nucleons in the relatively high - density liquid phase , larger effects from symmetric pressure in the stiffer @xmath145 for @xmath130 , shifts the liquid - phase boundary to a slightly higher density ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ pbound ] ) .",
    "the protoneutron star matter is found to exhibit a lgp transition even at very low densities at a high temperature of @xmath186 mev .    with the inclusion of light clusters ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ pbound ] ) , the softening of the eos shifts the low - density coexistence phase boundary to a higher value at temperatures @xmath187 mev where clusters become abundant . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - density boundary that is dominated by free nucleons is relatively unaffected .",
    "thus the clusters effectively reduce the width of the phase coexistence region and increases the critical temperature to @xmath188 mev for @xmath130 case .    in fig .",
    "[ ypns ] , the particle fractions are shown for neutrino trapped matter at an electron lepton fraction @xmath189 at temperatures of @xmath190 and 2 mev for uniform matter ( solid line ) and in the coexistence liquid - gas phase ( dashed line ) .",
    "one of the major effects of trapping is to enhance the net electron fraction @xmath191 over the entire baryon density range ; the magnitude of @xmath191 gradually increases with @xmath192 .",
    "considering first uniform matter ( solid line ) , at @xmath169 @xmath8 , the energy and pressure of the hot protoneutron star matter is entirely dominated by the non - degenerate electrons because of their small mass . due to charge neutrality ,",
    "the rapid rise of net electrons at this low density enforces an equally large enhancement of net number of free protons and a consequent drop in free neutron density due to baryon number conservation ( see figs .",
    "[ ypns](a ) and [ ypns](c ) ) .",
    "this tends to make the lepton - rich matter in this density regime highly symmetric with identical free neutron and proton fractions .    for uniform matter at higher densities ,",
    "clusters dominate the particle yield ( compared to free protons and neutrons especially at high @xmath114 ; ( figs .",
    "[ ypns](b ) and [ ypns](d ) ) so that the charge neutrality is maintained primarily by the bound protons in these clusters .",
    "compared to @xmath193 ( fig .",
    "[ yp ] ) , larger electron fraction in the present @xmath194 case enhances the cluster production via charge neutrality . at all temperatures of interest in the supernova dynamics , we find @xmath172 and deuteron to be the dominant clusters .",
    "thus , within this density range the star matter is also highly symmetric but due to abundant symmetric cluster formation .    with the onset of liquid - gas phase transition ,",
    "it is important to note from fig .",
    "[ ypns ] that cluster formation drops drastically ( dashed lines ) .",
    "this stems from vanishing cluster contribution from the liquid part of the mixed phase that has a density well above the transition value where the clusters dissolve , as well as due to small cluster fraction in the gas phase that has a density smaller compared to the total @xmath104 .",
    "thus at small @xmath195 mev in the coexistence phase , @xmath174 is effectively enhanced and becomes identical to @xmath191 .",
    "this leads to the formation of @xmath177-@xmath178-@xmath121-@xmath179 matter that tends to be rather symmetric even in the coexistence phase .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath114 , as the cluster fractions are large and the onset of phase transition shifts to higher @xmath104 ( see fig . [ pbound ] ) , considerable amount of clusters can occur in the low - density uniform phase of a hot protoneutron star .",
    "the formation of clusters and near symmetrization of the pns matter has two major consequences .",
    "first , during the evolution of the supernova matter , the abundant light nuclei produced within the neutrino - sphere @xcite at densities @xmath196 @xmath8 may be ejected outside and contribute to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements .",
    "second , the decrease in the pressure due to the nuclear symmetry energy overwhelms the total increase from the thermal and leptonic pressures .",
    "this makes the equation of state softer with or without phase transition compared to the neutrino - free matter .",
    "it may be noted from fig .",
    "[ ypns ] , that at a fixed @xmath192 , anti - neutrino @xmath197 dominates over its particle counterpart at lower densities and/or in the coexistence region .",
    "moreover , the trapping density is also shifted to a higher value in the coexistence phase .",
    "thus , apart from neutrino transport , the exact location of the neutrino - sphere is quite sensitive to the influence of the coexistence phase in the supernova matter .    figure .",
    "[ asym ] , shows the variation of neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath198 with baryon density at several fixed lepton fraction @xmath199 that correspond to the deleptonization epoch of the supernova at @xmath190 mev .",
    "considering the @xmath130 set , the dip seen in the asymmetry for uniform matter ( solid lines ) at @xmath200 @xmath8 is due to cluster formation that increases with @xmath199 .",
    "a further rapid drop in the asymmetry at @xmath169 @xmath8 results from lepton dominance in the star .",
    "thus , even in the late stage of neutrino diffusion ( at small @xmath192 ) , abundant nuclei can be produced in the near - symmetric matter @xcite . with the onset of liquid - gas phase transition at @xmath201 @xmath8 ( dash - dotted line ) ,",
    "the asymmetry is found to decrease faster compared to the uniform matter .",
    "this stems from dominant contribution from the liquid part of the mixed phase which exhibits a dropping asymmetry at @xmath202 ( solid lines ) plus a fraction from the very low - density region of the gas phase that is nearly - symmetric .",
    "both these effects systematically favor a free energy with small @xmath3 .",
    "thus , compared to uniform matter , the supernova matter at @xmath186 mev is found to be nearly symmetric in the coexistence phase at larger densities near the neutrino - sphere and the pns behaves as @xmath177-@xmath178-@xmath121-@xmath179 matter .",
    "of course at higher temperatures , the cluster contribution would be enhanced and the onset of coexistence phase is also delayed to a higher density ; see figs .",
    "[ ypns](c)-(d ) . at a given @xmath104 ,",
    "this causes the pns to be somewhat less symmetric compared to that at lower temperatures .",

    "however , the effects of symmetry energy is negligible both at small densities that are dominated by leptons , and also in the mixed phase ( dotted line ) .",
    "figure [ sneos ] depicts the equation of state ( eos ) of supernova matter at @xmath204 for uniform matter and in the coexistence phase for @xmath205 ( solid lines ) and 0.03 ( dotted lines ) with clusters . at supranormal densities ,",
    "the matter is characterized by repulsive @xmath36-meson interaction that causes a rapid increase in the eos . at about the normal density of @xmath206 @xmath8 , the uniform matter shows a minimum for relatively small temperatures . this is a manifestation of the saturation properties of nuclear matter when thermal effects contribute modestly . a larger @xmath145 for the @xmath168 at @xmath207 ( dotted line ) gives a smaller binding energy .",
    "in fact , the sensitivity of symmetry energy on the eos persists till the contribution from free nucleons and/or clusters dominate up to a density of @xmath208 @xmath8 .    in the coexistence phase ,",
    "the ( free ) energy drops appreciably with decreasing density at small temperatures . as mentioned above , this is a consequence of the liquid part that contributes to enhance the binding of the system .",
    "the overall qualitative features found in the thermodynamic quantities with clusters are similar to those without clusters for the supernova matter ( not shown ) .",
    "compared to nucleons only supernova matter , the inclusion of cluster degrees of freedom reduces somewhat the total free energy .",
    "further , the total pressure is found to be small at @xmath6 @xmath8 when most of the cluster species contribute collectively .",
    "the pressure eventually becomes stiffer when only the massive alpha contributes dominantly at @xmath200 @xmath8 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ eos ] ) .",
    "consequently , clusters delay the onset of the coexistence phase ( situated in the soft low @xmath104 regime of the eos ) to a higher density compared to that without clusters .",
    "we now consider the constitution and structure of beta - equilibrated and charge neutral matter in the superdense regime .",
    "it may be noted that thermal effects contribute negligibly in this density regime where the nucleons become degenerate . in fig .",
    "[ nph ] , the abundances of baryons and leptons as a function of density are shown for the fsugold parameter sets @xmath184 and 0.03 with and without the trapped neutrinos",
    ". the composition of the matter should be quite sensitive to the symmetry energy @xmath145 as it relates to the chemical potential via @xmath209 @xcite which in turn , determines the hyperon production threshold density by the condition @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the energy density of the baryon species @xmath64 . for neutron star matter with @xmath212 ,",
    "the stiffer density dependence of symmetry energy at @xmath184 causes larger enhancement of electron ( and hence proton ) fraction compared to @xmath130 case .",
    "however , with the appearance of negatively charged @xmath213 hyperon which competes with leptons in maintaining charge neutrality , the lepton ( @xmath20 and @xmath38 ) concentrations begin to fall . consequently , the sensitivity of @xmath145 on the composition is diminished .",
    "the charge neutral @xmath214 hyperon then appears , which occurs at a somewhat earlier density for the stiff symmetry energy compared to the soft @xmath130 set .",
    "trapped neutrinos have a large influence on the composition of the protoneutron star as evident from fig . [ nph ] for @xmath215 .",
    "the appearance of hyperons is now delayed to higher densities since in the above mentioned threshold condition , the term @xmath216 turns out to be positive . with the emergence of @xmath157 hyperon , the dropping of proton and thereby the electron fraction is now compensated by the rise of @xmath21 abundances so that @xmath199 is maintained constant . a softer symmetry energy ( @xmath130 ) is found to favor a significantly larger @xmath217 .",
    "incidentally , at very high densities @xmath216 becomes negative .",
    "the impact of this alteration in the lepton chemical potentials is the emergence of positively charged @xmath218 before the @xmath219 hyperon . from the central densities of the maximum mass stars (",
    "see table i ) , it is evident that for the repulsive potential potential of @xmath220 mev used here , @xmath160 hyperons will not be present in the star matter at all . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt an attractive interaction potential of @xmath221 mev , as used in previous studies , the @xmath164 hyperon will appear at a density of @xmath222 followed by @xmath223 and @xmath218 in the star matter .",
    "in such a situation @xmath158s will not appear in neutrino - trapped matter .",

    "[ eos ] for the neutrino - free matter ( @xmath226 ) and matter with an electron lepton fraction @xmath215 corresponding to that of fig . [ nph ] . for nucleons - only star ,",
    "trapped neutrinos makes the eos softer as the decrease in the symmetry pressure due to enhanced proton fraction exceeds the increase in leptonic pressure .",
    "compared to the stiff @xmath184 set , a smaller symmetry energy / pressure at high density for the @xmath130 set obviously produces a softening in the eos . however , as a soft @xmath9 favors a large @xmath21 fraction @xcite , the softening is reduced in the lepton - rich matter . with the inclusion of hyperons ,",
    "the eos becomes softer in both lepton - rich and lepton - poor matter .",
    "this is essentially caused by the release of the fermi pressure of the nucleons into the hyperonic degrees of freedom , and also due to decrease of pressure exerted by the leptons as these are replaced by negatively charged hyperons @xcite .",
    "however in a protoneutron star , the trapped - neutrinos inhibit the onset of hyperons ( see fig .",
    "[ nph ] ) which makes the eos with hyperons stiffer compared to the neutrino - free matter @xmath227 a reversal of behavior relative to the eos for nucleons - only star matter . as evident ,",
    "the comparative stiffness increases for the larger @xmath145 ( @xmath184 ) that allows relatively slightly larger hyperon population in the cold catalyzed neutron star .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the differences in the eos should be reflected in the structure of the stars , namely their masses and radii .",
    "while most of the mass originate from the dense interior of the star , the crust has a negligible contribution of @xmath228 to the total mass .",
    "in contrast , about @xmath229 of the radius originates from the eos at @xmath230 and thus should be strongly influenced by the possible liquid - gas phase transition at this density regime . at first , the star sequence is calculated with the low density equation of state taken from baym - pethick - sutherland ( bps ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ; the effects of the coexistence and pure phase with clusters are discussed later . here , the overall eos is constructed by smoothly matching ( without any discontinuity in pressure , baryon and energy densities ) the bps equation of state at @xmath231 @xmath8 , followed by the mixed phase eos comprising of leptons and free nucleons only for the inner crust of the star in the rmf model , and finally with the rmf model eos at @xmath232 , with or without hyperons . the static star sequence obtained by solving tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations @xcite",

    ". with free nucleons and leptons - only star , the trapped - neutrinos give smaller maximum mass @xmath233 ( compared to @xmath212 case ) as the pressure from the stiff eos can support larger masses against gravitational collapse . with the introduction of hyperons , the reversal of behavior observed in the eos , i.e. trapping leads to a stiffer eos , is manifested in larger maximum mass protoneutron stars .",
    "note in general , the inclusion of hyperons leads to a relatively smaller mass stars due to softening of the eos .",
    "the larger radii in stars with hyperons are a consequence of weaker gravitational attraction from smaller masses that causes the stars to be large and diffuse . for the neutrino - free stars ,",
    "though @xmath130 gives smaller masses than @xmath184 , the corresponding star radii are however found to be smaller in the former case .",
    "the baryonic interactions in this model raises the maximum mass from @xmath236 for the eos of a free gas @xcite by a factor of about two for nucleons - only stars .",
    "however , the inclusion of hyperons in cold neutrino - free stars yield maximum masses that are smaller than the current observational lower limit of @xmath237 imposed by the larger mass of the binary pulsar psr @xmath238 @xcite .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ eos ] shows the eos for hot matter with entropy per baryon @xmath239 and @xmath199=0.4 for uniform matter ( dashed line ) and in the coexistence liquid - gas mixed phase ( solid line ) . for clarity , the eoss corresponding only to the high - density ( liquid ) regime of the mixed phase at volume fraction @xmath240 ( see eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) ) are shown .",
    "in fact , @xmath241 can be as low as @xmath242 near the low - density ( gas ) phase boundary .",
    "figure [ mr ] illustrates the effect of liquid - gas phase transition at low density on the mass - radius sequence of free nucleons and clusters - only protoneutron stars for @xmath130 . though the maximum masses are identical with @xmath243 the radii in the sequence of stars are all different .",
    "in particular , a stiff eos obtained in the mixed phase from gibbs construction gives consistently large radii protoneutron stars .",
    "compared to the bps @xcite equation of state used above at @xmath231 @xmath8 , the rmf models in general provide much stiffer eoss at the crust that result in stars with much larger radii .",
    "in this article , within an accurately calibrated relativistic mean field model where the nuclear symmetry energy has been constrained from measurements of neutron skin thickness of finite nuclei , the structure and properties of neutron and protoneutron stars are studied . for hot and lepton - rich protoneutron stars",
    "we examine the possible liquid - gas phase transition near the crust comprising of free nucleons and light clusters . compared to free nucleon abundances ,",
    "light clusters are found to dominate the particle yield at moderate and high temperatures in an uniform supernova matter .",
    "further , the fraction of trapped neutrino is shown to play an important role in making the supernova matter more symmetric via enhanced production of deuteron and alpha clusters . with liquid - gas phase transition ,",
    "the yields of clusters drop drastically at temperatures @xmath195 mev in the coexistence phase ; here near symmetrization over a wide density @xmath244 @xmath8 is achieved by the free nucleons that are not bound in the clusters . at these low densities ,",
    "symmetry energy has modest impact on the coexistence phase boundaries and on the equations of state of matter compared to thermal effects and on the number of trapped neutrinos .",
    "the influence of symmetry energy on hyperon production in the dense interior of cold neutron stars and hot lepton - rich protoneutron stars are studied . within the present knowledge of the potential depth of hyperons in bulk nuclear matter",
    ", we find a repulsive potential of @xmath160 hyperons inhibits its appearance in the star matter .",
    "neutrino trapping delays the appearance of hyperons due to relative disposition of chemical potentials of various species .",
    "a softer symmetry energy in general result in smaller chemical potentials that delays further the onset of hyperons and thereby reduces the hyperonization of the star matter .",
    "the emergence of hyperons soften the nuclear equation of state considerably in the fsugold model .",
    "this results in stars with very small masses especially for the cold deleptonized matter .",
    "we also find , that compared to uniform matter , a stiffer equation of state in the coexistence liquid - gas phase near the crust of hot lepton - rich matter yield stars with larger radii .",
    "the ongoing and future hypernuclear programs can provide accurate information of the potential depth of hyperons in bulk nuclear matter , which in conjunction with better mass and radius measurements of neutron stars could constrain the nuclear symmetry energy more accurately .",
