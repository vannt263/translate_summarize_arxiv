    "compact @xmath0 gauge theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions is one of the simplest models with dynamical gauge degrees of freedom and possesses some important similarities with qcd @xcite .",
    "the model has two essential features in common with qcd , confinement @xcite and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the theory is interesting in its own right , for it has analytically been shown to confine electrically charged particles even in the weak - coupling regime ( at zero temperature)@xcite .",
    "the confinement is understood as a result of the dynamics of the monopoles which emerge due to the compactness of the gauge field .",
    "the string tension as a function of the coupling behaves in a similar fashion to that of the 4-dimensional @xmath1 lattice gauge theory .",
    "this model also allows us to work with large lattices with reasonable statistics .",
    "other common features of compact @xmath2 and qcd are the existence of a mass gap and of a confinement - deconfinement phase transition at some non - zero temperature .",
    "thus , being reasonably simple and theoretically well understood in the weak - coupling limit , the @xmath0 model provides a good testing ground for the development of new methods and new algorithmic approaches . in a recent paper @xcite we have obtained the first clear picture of the static quark potential , showing very clear evidence of the linear confining behaviour at large distances",
    "the evidence of the the scaling behaviour of the string tension and the mass gap has also been observed in this model .    in the present paper",
    "we want to extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in various respects .",
    "since the measured ratio of spatial to temporal lattice spacings is not the same as the input parameter in the action , it becomes important to determine the true or renormalized anisotropy @xmath3 as a function of the bare anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "an important advantage of using anisotropic lattices has been the need to measure the renormalization of anisotropy in the simulation .",
    "the existing theoretical @xcite and numerical studies @xcite with wilson action for @xmath5 lattice gauge theory have shown that at finite coupling @xmath6 , the renormalized anisotropy @xmath3 differs appreciably form bare anisotropy @xmath7 .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that the use of improved actions , supplemented by tadpole improvement , besides providing a better discretization scheme for qcd , offer the advantage of a significant reduction of renormalization of @xmath7 to a few percent @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath8 ( ratio of the renormalized and bare anisotropy ) and anisotropic coefficients have been calculated to one - loop order for improved actions in various recent studies @xcite .",
    "these calculations have provided very reliable results and the observed behaviour is confirmed non - perturbatively by large scale simulations on fine lattices @xcite .",
    "we investigate the influence of tadpole improvement on isotropic and anisotropic lattices for the @xmath0 model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in reducing the renormalization of the bare anisotropy at weak and strong couplings .",
    "we also apply tadpole improved @xmath0 lattice gauge theory to calculations of the static quark potential , the string tension and the scalar glueball masses and compare the results with simulations of the wilson action .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . after outlining the tadpole improved @xmath0 gauge model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions in sect .",
    "ii , we describe the method for determination of the renormalized anisotropy in sect .",
    "we present results from our simulations on anisotropic lattices using both standard and tadpole improved wilson gauge action in sect .",
    "we compare bare and renormalized anisotropies , static quark potential and scalar glueball masses from these actions .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "v with a summary and outlook on future work .",
    "the tadpole - improved @xmath0 gauge action on an anisotropic lattice can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath9 \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the plaquette operator , @xmath11 is the bare anisotropy at the classical level and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mean fields for the tadpole improvement .",
    "the notation used in eq.([eqn1 ] ) differ slightly from that used in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the spatial and temporal mean - field improvement factors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 were absorbed into definition of @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "this , however , follows the notation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the anisotropic lattice",
    ", the mean fields are determined using the measured values of the average plaquettes @xcite .",
    "we first compute @xmath12 from spatial plaquettes , @xmath15 , and then we compute @xmath13 from temporal plaquettes , @xmath16 . another way to determine the mean fields",
    "is to use the mean links in landau gauge @xcite @xmath17 where the lattice version of the gauge condition is obtained by maximizing the quantity , @xmath18 since the temporal lattice spacing in our simulations is very small , we adopt the following convention @xcite for the mean fields in tadpole improvement @xmath19 this prescription eliminates the need for gauge fixing and the results yield values for @xmath12 which differ from those using landau gauge by only a few percent .",
    "following the procedure of klassen @xcite and shakespeare and trottier @xcite , we measure the static quark potential extracted from wilson loops in the spatial and temporal directions . accordingly on an anisotropic lattice",
    "there are two potentials , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the two potentials differ by a factor of @xmath3 and by an additive constant , since the self - energy corrections to the static potential are different if the quark and anti - quark propagate along the temporal or a spatial direction .",
    "thus @xmath3 can be determined by comparing the static quark potential computed from the logarithmic ratio of time - like wilson loops @xmath22 , where @xmath23 with the potential computed from that of the space - like wilson loops @xmath24 , where @xmath25 asymptotically , for large @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath24 approach @xmath28 to suppress the excited state contributions , a simple ape smearing technique @xcite was used . in this technique",
    "an iterative smearing procedure is used to construct wilson loop ( and glueball ) operators with a very high degree of overlap with the lowest - lying state . in our single - link smoothing procedure ,",
    "we replace every space - like link variable by @xmath29 \\label{eqn9}\\ ] ] where the sum over ` @xmath30 ' refers to the  staples \" , or 3-link paths bracketing the given link on either side in the spatial plane , and p denotes a projection onto the group @xmath0 , achieved by renormalizing the magnitude to unity .",
    "we used a smearing parameter @xmath31 and up to ten iterations of the smearing process . to reduce the statistical errors ,",
    "the time - like wilson loops were constructed from  thermally averaged \" time - like links @xcite .",
    "the links making up the space - like and time - like wilson loops are smeared by the same amount so that the ratios @xmath22 and @xmath24 have the same excited - state contribution .",
    "similarly , finite - volume corrections to the @xmath32 and @xmath24 are the same if the temporal and spatial extents are equal in physical units , i.e. @xmath33 in lattice units .",
    "these statements are expected to hold only for large @xmath34 , @xmath27 and @xmath35 ; otherwise there can be large @xmath36 lattice errors .",
    "the physical anisotropy is determined from the ratio of the potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 estimated from @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the unphysical constant in the potentials is removed by subtraction of the simulation results at two different radii @xmath39 the measured renormalization of the anisotropy , @xmath8 is then determined from @xmath40",
    "simulations were performed on four lattices of @xmath41 sites , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ranging from 32 to 48 with mean - link improvement , and four lattices with the wilson action .",
    "configurations were generated by using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the details of the algorithm are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "50000 sweeps were performed for thermalization of the configurations and self - consistent determination of the tadpole factors .",
    "configurations are stored every 250 sweeps thereafter . ensembles of about 1000 configurations were used to measure the static quark potential , while 1,400 configurations , at coupling values from @xmath44 to 2.5 , were generated for the glueball mass .",
    "we fixed @xmath45 in the first pass , so that the lattice size remains fixed at @xmath46 in all directions .",
    "the simulation parameters of the lattices analyzed here are given in table [ tadpara ] .    .",
    "[ tadpara ] simulation parameters for the lattices analyzed for renormalization of the anisotropy .",
    "the bare anisotropies @xmath4 and the means fields @xmath13 and @xmath12 for tadpole improvement are shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "mean field improved @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions was applied to calculations of the static quark potential , the renormalized lattice anisotropy and the scalar glueball masses .",
    "we analyzed the mean - link improved action on isotropic and anisotropic lattices and comparisons were made with the simulations of the wilson action . by comparing the static quark potentials computed from space - like and time - like wilson loops , we determined the physical anisotropy of the tadpole improved wilson action .",
    "we found that with mean - link improved wilson action , the bare anisotropy is renormalized by less than a few percent , in contrast with the standard wilson action , where the measured value of anisotropy is found to be about @xmath47 lower than bare anisotropy on the lattices analyzed here .",
    "we found that tadpole improvement significantly reduces discretization errors in the static quark potential and the glueball masses .",
    "the mass ratio of the two lowest glueball states scales against the effective lattice spacing towards a value close to 2.0 , as expected for a theory of free scalar bosons .",
    "we intend to extend pimc techniques to symanzik improved @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the intention is to study the effects of improvement on the scaling slope , the constant coefficients and scaling behaviour observed in the weak - coupling regime of the theory .",
    "we also plan the study the one - loop correction to the anisotropy factor for symanzik improved @xmath0 gauge action in three dimensions .",
