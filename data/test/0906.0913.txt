    "three - dimensional analytical solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations are difficult to find and only few solutions are known explicitly .",
    "a systematic method for finding a special class of three - dimensional magnetohydrostatic equilibria has been developed by in a series of papers by low ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and bogdan and low ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method relies on the presence of an external force derived from a potential , for example gravitation , and assumes that the electric current density has specific properties to allow analytical progress . in the simplest possible case ,",
    "the fundamental equation to be solved is linear and it can be shown that in cartesian and spherical geometry with external gravity it is very similar to a schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the linear case , solutions can be found using standard methods , like expansion in terms of orthogonal function systems @xcite or green s functions @xcite .",
    "some solutions have also been found for nonlinear cases @xcite .",
    "solutions found by this method have , for example , been used for models of solar and stellar coronae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "another , but less general method for finding three - dimensional magnetohysdrostatic equilibria in external gravitational fields has been proposed by osherovich ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    so far",
    "the method has only been used to find three - dimensional solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations in cartesian or spherical geometry with external gravity , although @xcite also generalizes the method to more general external potentials and forces , including in particular the centrifugal force in a rigidly rotating system .",
    "so far , no three - dimensional solutions to the magnetohydrostatic equations have been found for this case and it is the aim of this paper to close this gap .",
    "such solutions could , for example , be used to model the closed field line regions of rotating magnetospheres without symmetries , such as those of the outer planets .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the somewhat artificial case of magnetic fields outside a rigidly rotating cylinder , but purely for reasons of mathematical convenience as it is much easier to deal with the boundary conditions on a cylindrical boundary .",
    "it is in principle also possible to treat the more realistic case of a spherical body , but imposing boundary conditions would be more difficult .",
    "planetary magnetospheres are embedded in the solar wind ( or a stellar wind in the case of exoplanets ) and the boundary between the closed field line regions and the solar wind / open field line regions is a free boundary determined by total pressure balance , which would have to be calculated as part of the solution .",
    "the same statement applies to modeling the closed field line region of a stellar magnetosphere , where the boundary between closed and open field line regions carrying a stellar wind would have to be determined as part of the solution ( in a first idealized step one could maybe try to model the open field line regions by a potential field ) .",
    "there is little hope that any analytical progress could be made if the calculation of these free boundaries is included in the problem , as finding three - dimensional analytic solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations is a formidable problem even without considering free boundaries .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper should therefore only be considered as a step towards solving the global problem of modeling magnetospheres , but not as the full solution .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] we present the basic theoretical framework used in this paper , in section [ sec : solutions ] we present a number of analytical three - dimensional solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations in cylindrical geometry and we present a summary and conclusions in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider a cylinder of radius @xmath1 and infinite length rotating rigidly with constant angular velocity @xmath2 about its symmetry axis , which we take to be identical with the @xmath3-axis .",
    "we will use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 in a frame of reference co - rotating with the cylinder .    in this frame of reference",
    "the mhd equations are ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the magnetic field , @xmath8 is the current density , @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 is the plasma density and @xmath11 is the centrifugal potential .    following @xcite , we assume that @xmath12 substituting this into the force balance equation ( [ forcebal ] ) results in @xmath13 which implies that @xmath14 it follows that    @xmath15    the possibility of further analytical progress now depends on the choice of the function @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite suggests the choice @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a free function of the theory . the current density",
    "is then given by @xmath19 and because the current density depends linearly on the magnetic field , ampre s law ( [ ampere ] ) is also linear in @xmath7 .",
    "other choices for @xmath16 are possible , but lead to ampre s law being nonlinear in @xmath7 ( for an example in cartesian geometry see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    substituting ( [ fequation ] ) into ( [ pequation ] ) we can rewrite it in the form @xmath20 direct integration gives @xmath21 substituting ( [ fequation ] ) for @xmath16 into ( [ psol1 ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath22 for the pressure . here , @xmath23 is a positive function which represents a hydrostatic background pressure .",
    "the expression for the density can be evaluated by using ( [ psol1 ] ) to get @xmath24 substituting this into ( [ rhoequation ] ) and using ( [ fequation ] ) the final expression for the density finally becomes @xmath25 this form of the plasma pressure and density is a direct consequence of the assuming that current density has the form ( [ jdef ] ) with the function @xmath16 given by ( [ fequation ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the term representing the background density , @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 for the case discussed in the present paper , @xmath28 is strictly negative and the density is strictly positive , which implies the background pressure must be monotonically increasing with distance from the rotation axis , with the precise form depending on the form of the background density .",
    "we shall not present any detailed discussion of a specific model for the hydrostatic background plasma in this paper , but it is important to choose the hydrostatic background plasma in such a way that it guarantees that the full density and pressure are always positive , because that is not automatically guaranteed .",
    "also the background pressure will become important if one wants to solve the full magnetospheric problem including the free boundaries because continuity of total pressure across the free boundary is a necessary condition for an equilibrium solution .",
    "although in the present paper we will only make use of the potential ( [ vpot ] ) we remark that in deriving the expressions for the pressure and the density , ( [ psol2 ] ) and ( [ rhosol1 ] ) , no use has been made of the particular coordinate system or form of the potential @xmath28 .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this does of course not imply that this theory can be generalized to differentially rotating systems as that would violate ferraro s iso - rotation theorem @xcite . a permitted generalization of the potential ( [ vpot ] ) would be to add a gravitational potential , i.e. instead of having just a magnetized central body one would have a massive magnetized central body .",
    "the shape of the body and thus the form of the potential @xmath28 is irrelevant for the validity of ( [ psol2 ] ) and ( [ rhosol1 ] ) , as long as the gravitational potential is time - independent in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "an expression for the plasma temperature can be obtained if we assume that the plasma satisfies the equation of state of an ideal gas , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the universal gas constant and @xmath31 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the magnetic field can be calculated using ampre s law ( [ ampere ] ) .",
    "the current density can be written as @xmath32 so that @xmath33 this equation can be integrated with the result @xmath34 where @xmath0 is a free function . using ( [ fequation ] ) to substitute in for @xmath16",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 note that this is not yet the final expression for @xmath7 as the right hand side still depends on @xmath7 . taking the scalar product of ( [ b1 ] ) with @xmath36 and solving for @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38 the final expression for the magnetic field therefore is @xmath39 again , expression ( [ b2 ] ) is completely independent of the form of @xmath28 , bearing in mind the constraints discussed before .",
    "we also emphasize again that the specific form of ( [ b2 ] ) is a direct consequence of ( [ jdef ] ) and ( [ fequation ] ) .    for the form ( [ vpot ] ) of the potential",
    "we find the components of @xmath7 to be    @xmath40    with @xmath41 from ( [ b2 ] ) and the equations for the components of the magnetic field , ( [ br2 ] ) , ( [ bphi2 ] ) and ( [ bz2 ] ) , we see that @xmath0 is a pseudo - potential , from which @xmath7 can be determined by differentiation .",
    "we call it a pseudo - potential because the expression for @xmath42 is modified compared to that derived from a normal potential , where @xmath7 would be given by the the gradient of the potential .",
    "this modification is due to the presence of currents in the system , represented by the factor @xmath43 in the equation for @xmath42 , ( [ br2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the pseudo - potential @xmath0 is determined by substituting ( [ b2 ] ) into the solenoidal condition ( [ divb0 ] ) , giving @xmath44 again , this equation is valid for general forms of the potential @xmath28 , and not just for the form used in the present paper .",
    "an alternative form of this equation is @xmath45 with the @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the @xmath46 unit matrix . equation ( [ ueqv_alt ] ) is particularly useful if @xmath36 has more than one non - vanishing component .",
    "this would , for example , be the case if we would treat the present problem in spherical polar coordinates instead of cylindrical coordinates .    for the centrifugal potential ( [ vpot ] )",
    "we define @xmath50 and rewrite ( [ ueqv ] ) as @xmath51    equation ( [ uequation ] ) is the fundamental equation that has to be solved to calculate the three - dimensional magnetic field .",
    "the functions @xmath18 , or alternatively @xmath52 are free functions and can be chosen to make analytical progress possible .",
    "we remark that it is only possible to choose directly the function @xmath52 instead of @xmath18 because of the one - to - one mapping between @xmath4 and @xmath28 defined by ( [ vpot ] ) . in cases where this mapping is not one - to - one",
    ", more care has to be taken .    using the definition ( [ xidef ] ) of @xmath53 the expressions for the pressure and the density",
    "can be rewritten as    @xmath54 . \\label{rho_xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an important point to note is that ( [ p_xi ] ) and ( [ rho_xi ] ) ( or alternatively ( [ psol2 ] ) and ( [ rhosol1 ] ) ) do not automatically guarantee that pressure and density are always positive , but that one can always arrange them to be positive by choosing an appropriate background plasma model .",
    "equation ( [ uequation ] ) is very similar to laplace s equation and one can immediately see that it has separable solutions of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 integer and @xmath57 real . if we substitute ( [ usolsep ] ) into ( [ uequation ] ) we find that the radial function @xmath58 satisfies the equation @xmath59 this ordinary second order differential equation will generally have two linearly independent solutions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , say .",
    "since the partial differential equation for @xmath0 is linear the solutions for different @xmath56 and @xmath57 may be superposed to give the general solution in the form @xmath62 .",
    "\\label{usolution}\\ ] ] the complex coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be determined by the boundary conditions imposed on the surface of the cylinder ( @xmath65 ) and on the outer boundary ( @xmath66 ) and can be calculated using the standard formulae from the theory of fourier transformations and series . from a mathematical point of view , the outer boundary could be at infinity , but from a physical point of view the problem will usually only be considered on a finite domain since the assumptions made for deriving our theory will break down at a finite distance from the rotation axis .    for general choices of @xmath18 , or alternatively , @xmath52 , ( [ uequation ] ) , or",
    "the corresponding radial equation ( [ radialequation ] ) still has to be solved numerically .",
    "for some cases , however , exact solutions can be found , and we will discuss a couple of these cases in more detail now . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath3 have been normalised by the radius of the cylinder @xmath1 , i.e. that the cylinder radius is @xmath67 in these normalised coordinates .",
    "the simplest possible choice for @xmath52 is @xmath68 in this case equation ( [ radialequation ] ) takes the form @xmath69 with the two linearly independent solutions    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are modified bessel functions @xcite with @xmath73 . here",
    "@xmath74 has been assumed .",
    "another function @xmath52 for which analytical solutions of ( [ radialequation ] ) can be found is @xmath75 in this case ( [ radialequation ] ) has the form @xmath76 with the coordinate transformation @xmath77 ( [ radialex2 ] ) can be transformed into @xmath78 the solutions of ( [ radialex2trans ] ) can be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 as ( * ? ? ?",

    "this will usually involve expressions containing an infinite series and an integral , which , although not inherently difficult , can make the algebra a bit tedious , especially when calculating the pressure and density as terms that are quadratic in the magnetic field and its derivatives are involved .    for the sake of simplicity we will use a different method to calculate and discuss an illustrative example solution for the case @xmath82 . defining    @xmath83    ( [ uequation ] ) becomes @xmath84 which is the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that by rescaling of the coordinates @xmath85 and @xmath86 solutions to the laplace equation ( [ uequation_scaled ] ) can be transformed into solutions of ( [ uequation ] ) .",
    "a similar method has been used by @xcite for finding a closed expression for a green s function for the constant @xmath87-case in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the only constraint is that the transformed solutions have to be @xmath88-periodic in the @xmath5-coordinate .",
    "it should be noted that this is not a requirement for the solutions of the transformed laplace equation which could be used to satisfy the periodicity condition in the untransformed coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "another important point is that we are of course not restricted to using solutions to the laplace equation found in cylindrical coordinates , instead any other coordinate system could be used , e.g. spherical coordinates .",
    "we could even allow an inner boundary with a shape different from a cylinder , e.g. a sphere .",
    "the major disadvantage of this solution method compared to the standard separation of variables method is that it will be impossible to match given boundary conditions .",
    "also , the method only works for the @xmath89 constant case , but not for other choices of @xmath52 .    despite these limitations",
    "we shall now use the transformation method to generate and discuss an illustrative solution of the general method described in this paper .",
    "as we are only interested in presenting an example solution we shall simply assume boundary conditions which match the solution we arrive at by using the transformation . as a starting point we shall use a magnetic dipole field but we allow the position of the dipole to be off - axis and the direction of the dipole to be non - aligned with the symmetry axis of the cylinder . without loss of generality we can assume that the position of the dipole is @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the corresponding cartesian coordinate system ,",
    "the dipole sits on the @xmath93-axis at a distance @xmath94 from the origin .",
    "the appropriate solution of the laplace equation is @xmath95 where @xmath56 is the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath96 is the angle between the direction of the dipole moment and the direction of the @xmath85-axis and @xmath97 the angle between the direction of the dipole moment and the @xmath3-axis .    in order to make the transformed solution @xmath88-periodic , the argument of the trigonometric functions in @xmath0 has to be an integer multiple of @xmath5 .",

    "determining the free boundaries generally involves matching the total pressure on both sides of the free boundary and obviously the choice of the hydrostatic background plasma , which is part of the set of solutions presented here will be important . generally , if one would attempt to calculate a model with free boundaries using the results presented in this paper the separation of variable method is better suited than the transformation method due to the availability of a complete set of functions allowing the expansion of the general solution .",
