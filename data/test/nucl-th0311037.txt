    "with the development of the heavy mass ion accelerators technology , many isotopes being proton rich within the range of a=80 - 100 have been established .",
    "the studies on such isotopes , far away from the beta stability valley , are very useful in understanding many nuclear aspects .",
    "the investigation on the isospin admixture effect in the ground state of these proton rich nuclei can be considered as one of the possible candidate studies .",
    "it is well known that the isospin admixture effects of the nuclear states are very important in the estimates of the effective vector coupling constants based on fermi transitions , and in the description of the energies and the widths of the analog states and the isospin multiplets [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the isospin mixing is basically caused by the coulomb potential , or more accurately by that part of coulomb potential which changes over the nuclear volume . since the very small symmetry energy tries to minimize the difference in the proton and the neutron systems , coulomb forces are more dominant in nuclei for which the proton and the neutron numbers are close to each other .",
    "therefore , the isospin mixing can take large values in the ground state of the proton rich nuclei .",
    "the physics of the exotic nuclei , characterized by the very unusual ratios of the neutrons and the protons , can be considered as a test for the already well - established models of the nuclear structure that are used to describe the stable systems .",
    "since the parameters and the interactions used in the usual shell - model calculations are determined in order to reproduce the properties of the known nuclei , they may not always be appropriate for use in the calculation of the nuclei approaching to the drip lines .",
    "the isospin admixtures in the nuclear ground states have been calculated in various models .",
    "the two liquid hydrodynamic model is used to estimate the energies of the collective isovector monopole excitation with an isospin of @xmath10 [ 5 ] .",
    "the admixture of this excited state to the ground state with an isospin of @xmath11 , caused by the coulomb potential , turned out to be small @xmath12 for all stable nuclei with a@xmath13 .",
    "quantitative estimates performed by using the shell model [ 6 - 8 ] are approximately an order of magnitude larger than the estimate of bohr and mottelson .",
    "there are several effects which may cause such a difference in the mentioned estimates .",
    "first , the shell model calculations were performed in the particle - hole approximation and used a limited number of configurations .",
    "second , the residual isovector interaction was either neglected , or it was included in the tamm - dankoff approximation .",
    "third , the residual interaction was not related to the shell - model potential in the self consistent way .",
    "the residual isovector forces in separable form are derived for a given form of the shell - model potential [ 9 ] .",
    "the derivation is based on the isotopic invariance of the nuclear forces .",
    "the form of the interaction strength parameters is related to the potential given by the self - consistency relations .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath10 isospin admixture in the ground state of the parent nucleus can be determined by the sum of the square of the nuclear matrix elements for beta decay @xmath14 [ 9 ] .",
    "the absolute values of the admixtures , however , are in some cases several times larger than the hydrodynamic estimate .",
    "theoretical calculations for the isospin mixing in proton rich nuclei between a@xmath15 have been performed [ 10 - 20 ] .",
    "the hartree - fock calculations for the very proton - rich nuclei in the region around a@xmath15 predict the isospin mixing in an order of @xmath16 [ 13 ] . with the inclusion of the random phase approximation in the calculations , the isospin mixing increased by an amount of @xmath17 [ 10 ] .",
    "these estimates are still 2 - 3 times larger than the bohr and mottelson ones [ 5 ] .",
    "the pairing correlations between nucleons were not considered in all studies mentioned above .",
    "however , it has been stated in ref . [ 10 ] that these correlations could be of primary importance for medium and heavy nuclei .    in the present study , based on the spherical single - particle wave functions and energies with the pairing and the residual isovector interaction treated in qrpa ,",
    "the isospin admixtures in the ground states of the @xmath1sn isotopes and the differential cross sections for the charge - exchange reactions ( @xmath3he , t ) at e(@xmath3he)@xmath4 mev occurring by the excitation of the iar states in the @xmath0sb were investigated .",
    "in the calculations , considering the restoration of the isotopic invariance for the nuclear part of the total hamiltonian [ 9,21 ] the effective interaction strength @xmath18 in the quasiparticle space has been obtained in such a way that it is self consistent with the woods - saxon form of the shell model potential .",
    "thus , this method makes our model free of any adjustable parameters .",
    "let us consider a system of nucleons in a spherical symmetric average field interacting via pairing forces . in this case",
    ", the corresponding single quasiparticle hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath19 where the @xmath20 is the single quasiparticles energy of the nucleons with angular momentum @xmath21 , and the @xmath22 is the quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the shell model potential contains the isovector terms in nuclei having different proton and neutron numbers in addition to the coulomb potential and proton - neutron mass difference which breaks the isotopic invariance ( if the proton - neutron mass difference is neglected ) @xmath23 \\neq 0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the coulomb potential given by the following expression : @xmath25 with the radial part of the coulomb potential @xmath26 here , @xmath27  is to the proton density distribution in ground state .",
    "the isospin operators @xmath28 are defined in the following way : @xmath29 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }      \\widehat{t}_{x } , & \\hbox{$\\rho = + 1 $ ; } \\\\      i\\widehat{t}_{y } , & \\hbox{$\\rho = -1$. } \\\\",

    "let us note that the derivation of eq .",
    "( 7 ) uses only one assumption , namely the separability of the residual interactions .",
    "thus , the restoration of the isotopic invariance for the nuclear part of the hamiltonian is satisfied , and the total hamiltonian operator can be written in the form of @xmath36",

    "( 16 ) is fulfilled , the isospin is exactly conserved in all states .",
    "this latter fact is a natural consequence of the isospin invariance of the self - consistent nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "it has been shown in ref . [ 9 ] that if the pairing correlations between nucleons are not considered , two independent isobaric excited @xmath37 states occur from the ground state of parent nucleus : the @xmath80 states including isobar analog resonance ( iar ) in the nucleus with the number @xmath78 ( the isotopic spin of the parent nucleus is assumed as @xmath81 ) , and the @xmath82 excited states in the nucleus with the number @xmath14 .",
    "it must also be noted that both branches in question are dependent on the mother nucleus due to the fermi transition and the matrix elements for the @xmath83 transitions obeying fermi sum rule .",
    "let us now mention how the above situation changes with the presence of the pairing forces .",
    "first of all , there will be no two independent isobaric @xmath37 excited states , and these states will occur in both nuclei with the number @xmath78 and @xmath14 due to the violation of particle number conservation .",

    ". this matrix element exhausts the full strength of the fermi transition .",
    "the separation of the iar state appearing in eqs .",
    "( 19 - 22 ) from the other states and the collection of all the @xmath84 transition strength on this state are the evidence for the conservation of the isotopic invariance for the nuclear part of the shell model hamiltonian .",
    "when the isospin structure of the ground state for the nuclei considered in the present study is investigated , it is observed that the isospin impurity of the ground states and iar are related to the matrix elements of the @xmath83 transitions ( @xmath93 ) [ 5 ] . expanding the ground state wave function in terms of the pure isospin components @xmath94",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 this expansion states that the ground state of the parent nucleus will contain only the @xmath96 isospin admixtures caused by the isovector coulomb potential .",
    "the expectation value of the square of the isospin in the ground state of the parent nucleus can be expressed as @xmath97 on the other hand , the following expression for the same quantity can be obtained from eq . ( 26 ) @xmath98 from eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , it follows that the @xmath96 isospin admixture in the ground state of the parent nucleus is determined by the sum of the squares of the beta decay matrix elements from the isobaric states of the nucleus @xmath14 : @xmath99 ^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i}\\left\\vert m_{\\beta ^{+}}^{i}\\right\\vert ^{2 } .\\ ] ] this result obtained in ref [ 9 ] is given over the sum of the @xmath100 transition matrix elements from the parent nucleus to the neighbor odd - odd ( n+1 , z-1 ) nuclei .",
    "however , in the similar studies , the @xmath96 isospin admixture is usually determined by the coulomb mixing of the ground state with the isovector monopole excited states in the same even - even nucleus [ 13,23 ] .",
    "if the nucleon motion of the @xmath3he beam is much faster than the relative fermi motion of the nucleons in @xmath3he , the ( @xmath3he , t ) reaction is expected to become simple like the ( p , n ) reaction at intermediate energies .",
