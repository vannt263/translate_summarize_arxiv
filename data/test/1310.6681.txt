    "many efficient sources of quasi - monochromatic hard radiation exploit transmission of ultrarelativistic electrons through periodic structures ( crystals or undulators ) @xcite . for such so - called coherent sources ,",
    "high radiation brightness is relatively easy to achieve by increasing the periodic structure length .",
    "the price to pay , however , is that as the photon emission probability reaches the order of unity , the description of the source performance must regard the possibility of creation of a few photons and electron - positron pairs per passing electron , i.e. , essentially electromagnetic cascading @xcite .",
    "the proper procedure for calculation of electromagnetic multiple particle production at ultra - relativistic energies is via a system of kinetic equations for sequential photon and @xmath0 pair creation , allowing for energy redistribution at each branching . in a non - trivial field of the radiator , this complete procedure",
    "is involved , and generally requires numerical simulation .",
    "fortunately , in a quite typical case when typical photon energies are inferior to the incident electron energy , the calculations may appreciably simplify .",
    "first of all , the probability of pair production is not enhanced so strongly as that of radiation @xcite , and thus can be neglected in the first approximation .",
    "secondly , the negligibility of photon recoils allows treating the electron current as fully determined by the electron s initial conditions , entailing statistical independence of multiple photon emission acts @xcite .",

    ", the measured radiation spectra begin to depend on the photon detection method .",
    "if it was feasible experimentally , in spite of high radiation intensity , to distinguish arrivals of individual photons , the detector signal under soft photon emission condition would be described merely by formula from classical electrodynamics for the radiation energy spectrum .",
    "but narrow beaming of the radiation from ultra - relativistic electrons causes pileup of reactions from different photons in the downstream detector volume , thus affecting the detector signal .",
    "spectrometers for gamma - quanta @xcite today are predominantly based on calorimetry ( measurement of the total energy deposition in a detector ) @xcite , but to capture most of the energy of electromagnetic shower created by the hard photon , the calorimeter transverse size must be in excess of the typical shower lateral spread ( molire radius ) , which amounts a few centimeters @xcite .",
    "that in turn impedes angular resolution of the radiation within its lorentz - contracted emission cone , which might otherwise be employed to eliminate photon pileups .",
    "scheme of gamma - radiation spectrum measurement yielding a multiphoton spectrum .",
    "the spent electron is deflected by a magnet , so only the forward - flying photons hit the calorimeter . ]    in view of appreciable difficulties with eliminating photon pileup effects , a common attitude at laboratory measurements of gamma - radiation spectra is not to pursue the objective of photon counting at all .",
    "then , a single electromagnetic calorimeter is used to measure the _ total _ energy deposited by _ all _ the @xmath1-quanta per event of electron passage through the radiator ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : calorim - scheme ] ) . clearly , the latter method is equivalent to measuring the electron s radiative energy loss spectrum .",
    "furthermore , sometimes a simplified procedure of radiation spectrum measurement is adopted , when spent electron energies are measured , which then truly yields the spectrum of full energy losses by electrons in the radiator .",
    "even though the calorimetric method for spectrum measurement hinders applicability of formulas of classical electrodynamics , those can still be useful for the spectrum calculation .",
    "indeed , the theory predicts that multiple soft photon emission probabilities factorize , expressing through the same classically calculated spectral intensity . to obtain the multiphoton spectrum ,",
    "one thus needs to resum all @xmath2-photon probabilities while holding the total irradiated energy at a preselected value .",
    "technically , the problem is similar to that of fast charged particle energy loss under statistically independent atom ionization acts in the medium @xcite , and some other problems @xcite , whose solutions were attained by integral transform methods . for generic energy loss spectrum by a fast particle in the medium , a laplace transform solution",
    "was known since 1944 @xcite . in application to radiation , it was later utilized in @xcite , with the purpose of investigating soft ( photon - dominated ) electromagnetic showers in crystals and polycrystals , and checking the possibility of the shower length reduction due to coherent radiation effects .",
    "relatively recently , in @xcite this method was used for studying the shape of the soft part of the radiation spectrum from electrons in an amorphous medium .",
    "model solutions for shapes of synchrotron - like radiation spectra in crystals were discussed in @xcite .",
    "there were also several investigations of shapes of radiation spectra in crystals , based on numerical simulation ( usually by monte - carlo ) , with @xcite or without @xcite neglect of @xmath0 pair production as a first approximation . notwithstanding the pretty long history of the problem , there still remain many open questions concerning multiphoton effects on coherent radiation spectrum shapes .",
    "for example , since coherent radiation spectra are typically sharply peaked and discontinuous , the prime task is to investigate how do such features modify under multiphoton emission conditions . in so doing ,",
    "it is also important to incorporate an incoherent bremsstrahlung component , which may require some special treatment , because of its divergent total probability .",
    "next , it is important to give proper study for the behavior of the resummed coherent radiation spectrum in the high intensity ( or photon multiplicity ) limit .",
    "there , one generally expects the spectrum to tend to a gaussian form , but corrections to this form may be significant at practice , and demand evaluation .",
    "besides the abovementioned most urgent problems , there is a number of developments which are desirable to make in the theory .",
    "first , it is expedient to supplement the notion of the resummed spectrum by that of photon multiplicity spectrum , which was proven measurable in experiments at cern @xcite .",
    "secondly , it would be valuable for various purposes to find a possibility to reconstruct the single - photon spectrum from a calorimetrically measured one .",
    "other issues include correspondence with the perturbation theory , separation of energetically ordered and anti - ordered contributions , etc .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive formulation for the theory of resummed soft coherent radiation spectra , and with its aid , to tackle problems raised above .",
    "although conditions of coherent radiation in different sources may vary , we concentrate on one of the most typical cases  dipole radiation ( for overview of its conditions see , e.g. , @xcite ) , under the simplifying assumption of approximately harmonic transverse oscillation of the radiating electron ( the neglect of higher harmonics ) .",
    "we incorporate also an incoherent radiation component , which , fortunately , has a simple structure , free from model assumptions . the interference between coherent and incoherent spectral components may be neglected in the first approximation .",
    "therewith , there emerges a fairly model - independent description of radiation , which can embrace diverse practical situations .",

    "a few technical issues are relegated to the appendices .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , for radiation emitted by an ultra - relativistic electron ( or positron ) , the radiation angles are typically small ( inversely proportional to the electron s lorentz factor ) , wherefore they often remain experimentally unresolved . in the latter case , only the radiation spectrum is measured . for coherent radiation ,",
    "the spectrum is concentrated on a characteristic energy scale @xmath3 , which is often much smaller than the initial electron energy @xmath4 : @xmath5 under those circumstances , the radiation recoils may be neglected , and the radiation process be treated as statistically independent emissions of photons by a classically moving charged particle .",
    "the description of the multiphoton spectrum then proceeds as follows . ] .",
    "let the classically evaluated radiation energy spectrum , integrated over relativistically small emission angles , equal @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding photon number density could be derived as @xmath7 that might as well be interpreted as the probability distribution for emission of a photon , but only provided its integral @xmath8 which is to correspond to the total emission probability , is @xmath9 .",
    "sometimes the latter condition is fulfilled thanks to the smallness of electron coupling with the electromagnetic field , @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , in a long radiator , @xmath11 can accumulate and get arbitrarily large .",
    "as it becomes sizable , proper probabilistic treatment must take into account emission of an arbitrary number of photons .",
    "assuming that the radiation process remains soft and intrinsically semiclassical , photon emission acts can be proven to be statistically independent @xcite , thereby obeying poisson statisticsa word of caution must be sound that poisson statistics holds only for a completely prescribed classical electromagnetic current . at practice , the radiation spectrum can yet depend on the electron impact parameters and momentum dispersion within the initial beam , fluctuations of the intra - crystal field due to thermal vibrations and lattice defects , etc .",
    "therefore , the poisson distributions must be averaged over the beam and target ensembles , but only at the last step of the calculation ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper",
