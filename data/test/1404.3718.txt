    "radio mini - halos are diffuse extended sources that are found in some relaxed , cool - core clusters .",
    "they have steep radio spectra ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) and sizes of @xmath6  kpc , somewhat smaller than mpc - scale giant radio halos that are found in merging galaxy clusters .",
    "the emission from mini - halos typically surrounds the central radio source associated with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "mini - halos are rare with less than 20 confirmed cases .",
    "the prototypical example is the mini - halo found in the perseus cluster .    considering the lifetimes of the radio emitting electrons and the extent of the mini - halos , a form of in - situ cosmic ray ( cr ) production or re - acceleration",
    "is required to explain their presence .",
    "several different possibilities have been put forward .",
    "hadronic ( also called secondary ) models invoke collisions between cr protons and thermal protons to produce a population of secondary relativistic electrons . alternatively",
    ", the synchrotron emitting electrons could arise from mildly relativistic electrons ( for example cooled electrons from the central radio galaxy ) that have been re - accelerated by turbulence .",
    "recently , an interesting correspondence between cold fronts and mini - halos has been found for some clusters .",
    "based on this , the idea has been put forward that sloshing motions , induced by minor mergers , generate turbulence in the cores of clusters , which is then capable of re - accelerating electrons . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "these electrons emit synchrotron emission and could form a mini - halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite also mention the possibility of a more direct connection and possible transition between mini - halos and giant radio halos in clusters .",
    "in this letter we report on the results of giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) radio observations of the phoenix cluster ( ) , which were taken as part of a larger radio survey of distant massive galaxy clusters ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "the phoenix cluster was discovered from its sunyaev - zeldovich effect signal with the south pole telescope @xcite and is located at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the bcg appears to be undergoing a strong starburst with a star formation rate of @xmath8  m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this cluster is the most extreme cool - core cluster known ( @xmath10 m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is also very massive ( @xmath11  m@xmath9 ) .",
    "interestingly , the combination of a high cooling rate and the relatively weak central radio source ( associated with the bcg ) suggests that feedback has been unable to halt cooling in this system , leading to the high star formation rate .",
    "in this letter we adopt a @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . with the adopted cosmology ,",
    "1  corresponds to a physical scale of 6.652  kpc at @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting luminosity distance ( @xmath17 ) is @xmath18  mpc .",
    "all our images are in the j2000 coordinate system .",
    "spt - cl  j23444243 was observed with the gmrt on june 14 and 15 , 2013 , for a total of about 10  hrs . due to the low - elevation of the cluster at the gmrt site , the observing time",
    "was divided into two separate sessions .",
    "the continuum observations were carried out at a frequency of 610  mhz with a usable bandwidth of 29  mhz .",
    "in addition , we used gmrt 156  mhz archival data taken on august 5 , 2011 , with a total on source time of 13  min .",
    "both datasets were reduced via a semi - automatic data reduction scheme employing the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) , parseltongue @xcite and obit @xcite .",
    "the data reduction started with automatic radio frequency interference ( rfi ) removal , bandpass and gain calibration .",
    "the flux calibration was performed according to the scale described in @xcite .",
    "the calibration was further refined via several cycles of self - calibration .",
    "low - level broadband rfi was subtracted using an improved version of the method described by @xcite .",
    "after self - calibration , direction - dependent calibration solutions were obtained for sources with a signal to noise ratio @xmath19 .",
    "the imaging was done via facets to apply the direction - dependent calibration solutions and to correct for the non - coplanar nature of the array .",
    "archival data from a _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis - i observation were also studied .",
    "the 11.9  ks of data ( ) were calibrated following the processing described in @xcite , applying the most recent calibration files .",
    "the calibration included the application of gain maps to calibrate photon energies , a correction for position - dependent charge transfer inefficiency , and filtering of counts with a recomputed asca grade 1 , 5 , or  7 and those from bad pixels .",
    "in addition , periods of elevated background were filtered by examining the light curves .",
    "periods with count rates a factor of 1.2 above the mean count rate in the 612  kev band were also removed .",
    "the discarded exposure time was negligible ( 132  s ) .",
    "the final image was made in the 0.52.0  kev band to increase the contrast between the thermal bremsstrahlung and agn emission from the central bcg , and to maximize the ratio between source and background counts .",

    "this shallow image only displays the central compact radio source , but there is a hint of a southward extension towards compact source  c.    because of our limited spatial resolution and the fact that the cluster is located at @xmath16 , it is somewhat difficult to accurately separate the diffuse emission from the central compact radio source .",
    "in addition , the contribution from other compact sources needs to be subtracted .",
    "the integrated flux densities of the compact sources were measured with the aips task jmfit , fitting gaussian components to the sources .",
    "the resulting integrated flux densities are given in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are based on the map noise and an absolute flux calibration uncertainty of 10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of diffuse emission on scales of @xmath31  kpc at 610  mhz , provides the first evidence that the central region of the phoenix cluster contains an extended non - thermal component . in principle",
    "two possible explanations can be given for the diffuse component .",
    "the diffuse emission either originates from the radio lobes of the central agn ( source a ) or it indicates the existence of a mini - halo . since the diffuse emission surrounds the central agn and its morphology does not resemble that of radio lobes , we classify this extended emission as a radio mini - halo .",
    "the physical extent of this mini - halo is also very similar to that of other known mini - halos in cool - core clusters .",
    "a small extension towards the se of source a is seen in the high - resolution image ( fig .  [ fig:610im ] ; right panel ) .",
    "we attribute this emission to source  a , and not to the mini - halo .",
    "higher resolution radio observations are required to determine the precise nature of this extension .",
    "we estimate the integrated mini - halo flux density using two different methods . for the first method , we simply integrate the flux enclosed within the @xmath32 contours from fig .",
    "[ fig:610im ] ( left panel ) and subtract the flux densities from the compact sources ( a , b , and c ) as are given in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "in this way we obtain a mini - halo flux density of @xmath33  mjy .",
    "for the second method , we did attempt to remove the flux from the compact sources directly from the uv - data by subtracting the clean components from the high - resolution image shown in fig  [ fig:610im ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we then re - imaged the data tapering to a resolution of 25  resolution .",
    "this image is shown overlaid on the chandra 0.52.0  kev x - ray image in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] . the diffuse radio emission peaks approximately at the same position as the x - ray emission . from this low - resolution image",
    "we obtain a flux of @xmath34  mjy .",
    "this value likely underestimates the mini - halo flux density because some emission from the mini - halo has been subtracted since the mini - halo contributes flux on scales larger than 7  k@xmath30 .",
    "if we double the inner uv - range cut for making the high - resolution clean component model , we obtain a flux of @xmath35  mjy for the radio mini - halo .    for the remainder of this letter",
    "we adopt a flux density of @xmath0  mjy for the mini - halo .",
    "this was obtained by integrating within the @xmath32 contours and subtracting the compact sources flux densities , but with the uncertainty of @xmath36  mjy reflecting the difficulties involved in separating the diffuse emission from the compact sources ( i.e. , approximately covering the range between the highest and lowest flux estimates reported in the previous paragraph ) . with this integrated flux density",
    ", we calculate a @xmath37-corrected 1.4  ghz radio power of @xmath38 w  hz@xmath2 using @xmath39 . for the mini - halo spectral index we adopted a value of @xmath40    at 156  mhz",
    "we measure a flux density @xmath41  mjy for the combined cluster emission ( diffuse emission + compact sources ) , in a region twice the 156  mhz beam size centered on the peak emission .",
    "taking precisely the same region at 610  mhz , we compute an overall spectral index ( central agn and mini - halo combined ) of @xmath42 .",
    "typically mini - halos have steeper radio spectra than the central agn and therefore the mini - halo emission could be considerably steeper than @xmath43 . in particular because the central compact core dominates the integrated flux density . however , resolved multi - frequency observations are needed to obtain separate spectral indices for the compact and diffuse components .",
    "in addition , deeper observations are needed to determine the full angular extent of the mini - halo .",
    "a closer inspection of the chandra image reveals non - concentric x - ray isophotes ( fig  [ fig : xray ] ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is more extended in the nw direction at @xmath44 from the cluster center , while at a radius of @xmath45  the cluster emission extends more in the se direction .",
    "we report the discovery of a @xmath46  kpc ( total extent ) radio mini - halo in the phoenix cluster using gmrt 610  mhz observations . at a redshift of @xmath47 ,",
    "the mini - halo in the phoenix cluster is currently the most distant one known . combining the 610  mhz data with shallow 156  mhz gmrt observations",
    ", we estimate an upper limit of @xmath42 for the mini - halo spectral index . by assuming a spectral index of @xmath48 we estimated that the mini - halo has a 1.4  ghz radio power of @xmath1 w  hz@xmath2 , higher than the perseus cluster mini - halo @xcite but less than the rx  j1347.5@xmath491145 mini - halo .",
    "this radio power / luminosity falls in the range that is expected for mini - halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    suggested a connection between the origin of the mini - halo synchrotron emission and cooling flows in clusters .",
    "this should result in a correlation between @xmath50 and the cooling flow power : @xmath51 .",
    "such a correlation is observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the phoenix cluster we have @xmath52  erg  s@xmath2 . given this extremely high cooling flow power , we would expect the phoenix cluster mini - halo to have the highest known @xmath50 of any cluster , which is however not the case .",
    "however , it is important to note that the observed scatter is quite large for the correlation and also our derived cooling power is uncertain due to the uncertain mass inflow rate ( @xmath10 m@xmath9  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "more accurate measurements of @xmath53 and also @xmath50 will be needed to determine whether the phoenix cluster mini - halo deviates from the @xmath50@xmath54 correlation .",
    "the presence of a mini - halo in the phoenix cluster has some interesting implications , related to the association of mini - halos , cold fronts and gas sloshing .",
    "simulations show that cold fronts may be caused by gas sloshing , induced by a minor merger event ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "minor mergers with a non - zero impact parameter result in cold fronts that form a non - concentric spiral - like pattern in the x - ray gas .",
    "these spiral - type patterns have been observed in cool - core clusters and many of these clusters also host mini - halos . in a few cases , the radio emission displays a spatial correlation with the spiral - like patterns in the x - ray gas @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the synchrotron emitting electrons are trapped in the same icm flows that resulted in the spiral - like pattern .",
    "since minor merger events also inject turbulence into cluster cores , it has been proposed that this turbulence could re - accelerate a population of fossil electrons ( for example from the central radio galaxy ) giving rise to diffuse radio emission in the form of a radio mini - halo ( see the numerical simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the above framework",
    ", the presence of a mini - halo in the phoenix cluster implies that the cluster core has enough turbulent energy , possibly caused by sloshing gas motions , to re - accelerate a population of relativistic particles .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the non - concentric x - ray isophotes we found .",
    "since the gas - sloshing motions could be induced by a merger event , this raises the question whether the very high star formation rate measured for the phoenix cluster core could ( partly ) be the result of a merger event with a gas - rich system .",
    "this possibility is however disfavored by @xcite .",
    "upcoming chandra observations might have the sensitivity to detect cold fronts and spiral - like patterns to determine if the mini - halo in the phoenix could be related to sloshing motions and turbulence .",
