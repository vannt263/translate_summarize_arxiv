    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that pbhs can also form on scales which never leave the horizon .",
    "we do not consider this possibility here .    in this paper",
    "we use a modified flow analysis to identify inflation models where the perturbations at the end of inflation may be large enough for primordial black holes to be overproduced . for these models",

    "the cosmological observables are calculated at the late - time fixed point i.e. the model is forced to evolve to its asymptotic limit . in this limit",
    "the running of the spectral index is negligible .",
    "therefore for models which are compatible with the wmap 7 year measurement of the spectral index , @xmath22  @xcite , the amplitude of the curvature perturbations can not be large on any scale and pbhs are never formed in significant numbers  @xcite .",
