    "at present , almost all physical theories pretending to the role of a theory unifying all known fundamental interactions are formulated in spacetime having more than four dimensions .",
    "extra dimensions may have either microscopic size of order of the fundamental planck length or they may be large , and even infinite . in the first case , the smallness of extra dimensions can be achieved by introducing special mechanisms providing compactification of extra dimensions when their characteristic size becomes much less than that of four - dimensional spacetime .    in models with large extra dimensions",
    ", it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on some hypersurface ( called a brane ) which , in turn , is embedded in some multidimensional space ( called a bulk ) @xcite . in such approach ,",
    "two classes of branes are introduced : infinitely thin branes and thick branes .",
    "a brane is called infinitely thin if it has a delta - like distribution of matter along the extra dimension . however , from a realistic point of view , it is most reasonable to expect that a brane has a finite thickness .",
    "there are many works devoted to investigations in this direction ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all known thick brane solutions can be classified into two large groups : static solutions and solutions depending on time ( cosmological thick branes ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", a search for thick brane solutions implies the derivation of regular solutions of multidimensional field equations with a given material source . as a source of matter ,",
    "various scalar fields are often used . the asymptotic geometry of spaceime outside a brane ( the bulk geometry )",
    "can be either flat , de sitter or anti - de sitter .",
    "one of the main advantages of use of scalar fields in modeling thick branes is that on the one hand the models obtained are comparatively simple , and on the other hand scalar fields are fundamental by their nature .",
    "however , this does not exclude the possibility of creating brane models in using other fundamental fields .",
    "for example , it could be spinor fields . as we know",
    ", there are no so many solutions with spinor fields in general relativity . in particular , some cosmological solutions with spinor fields were found in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in this connection ,",
    "a search for other solutions would be interesting in itself . as applied to branes , in @xcite we considered a static model of a thick brane supported by a nonlinear spinor field . in this model ,",
    "the five - dimensional regular solutions both with and without cosmological term were found .",
    "the solutions obtained in @xcite are completely static , when all physically measurable quantities ( the metric function and the spinor field ) are to be time - independent .",
    "the next step is to examine a model when a spinor field is time - dependent . in this case , since spinor field components are bilinear combinations such as @xmath0 , one can seek a solution for the spinor field in the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a column matrix which components depend only on the extra space coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of such time - dependent components of the spinor field leads to the appearance of the off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor . to avoid this , we add to the model one more spinor field . in this case",
    "one can choose two spinor anstze in such a way that the off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor of every spinor field would have the opposite signs and annihilate each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ gen_equations ] we derive the field equations for the model of a thick brane with two time - dependent spinor fields having an arbitrary potential energy , and with a cosmological term taken into account .",
    "choosing the special anstze for these fields , the off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor are excluded . in section [ special_poten ]",
    "an example of numerical calculations for a special form of the potential energy is presented . in section [ trapp_sect ]",
    "the trapping of a test scalar field to the brane is considered .",
    "we consider the five - dimensional gravitation with a nonlinear spinor field as a source of matter .",
    "the lagrangian of the spinor field is @xmath4 we choose the potential @xmath5 satisfying the condition @xmath6 the corresponding five - dimensional einstein and dirac equations are @xmath7 \\psi & = & 0 , \\label{2 - 30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the lorentz index ; @xmath9 is the world index ; @xmath10 is the 5-bein ; @xmath11 are the five - dimensional dirac matrices in a flat minkowski space ; @xmath12 is the covariant derivative of the spinor @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 are some parameters ; @xmath17 is the cosmological constant ; @xmath18 is the five - dimensional covariant minkowski metric .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the spinor field is taken according to the textbook @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the five - dimensional dirac matrices in a curved spacetime ; @xmath21 is the five - dimensional contravariant metric tensor ; @xmath22 is the dirac conjugated spinor ; @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "our definition of the energy - momentum tensor has the opposite sign comparing with @xcite in order to be consistent with the definitions for @xmath25 from @xcite .",
    "the five - dimensional dirac matrices in a flat minkowski space are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath28 unity matrix , and @xmath29 are pauli matrixes @xmath30 we seek a wall - like solution of the system - .",
    "to do this let us choose the five - dimensional bulk metric in the form @xmath31    next , we are going to consider a system consisting of two spinor fields @xmath32 .",
    "the reason for this is to exclude off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor . for the spinor fields",
    ", we use the following time - dependent ans \" atze @xmath33 then the corresponding components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xmath34 it is easily seen from expressions that _ the contributions from @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the opposite signs for the off - diagonal components @xmath37 . _ consequently , the combined energy - momentum tensor for two spinor fields has the diagonal components only .",
