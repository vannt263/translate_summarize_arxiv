    "synchrotron peak frequencies of bl lac objects cover a large range from ir to x - rays , and based on its location they are called low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbl ; synchrotron peak in the ir ) , intermediate bl lac objects ( ibl ; synchrotron peak in the optical / uv ) , or high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbl ; synchrotron peak in the x - rays ) .    while there is little evidence for dense radiation environments in the nuclear regions of bl  lac objects",

    "close to the central black hole and accretion disk , direct emission from the accretion disk may dominate the radiation energy density .",
    "however , for moderate distances from the disk , the primary @xmath1-ray beam will interact with the accretion disk emission under an unfavorable angle for @xmath2 pair production . to illustrate this point , we plot in figure [ diskabs ] the opacity to @xmath2 absorption in the radiation field of an optically thick , geometrically thin @xcite accretion disk as a function of height @xmath7 of the emission region from the black hole .",

    "we therefore conclude that the neglect of the accretion - disk emission in our simulations is a good approximation throughout almost all of our simulation volume . for the case of thermal blackbody radiation fields considered below ,",

    "the shape of the resulting pair cascade emission is only very weakly dependent on the exact shape of the incident vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ plexpcomparison ] , in which we run a cascade simulation , once with a straight power - law , once with a powerlaw + exponential cut - off ( as a more realistic representation of a physical blazar high - energy spectrum ) , with identical environmental parameters , as listed in the figure caption . while the overall normalization of the cascade spectrum , obviously , depends on the flux of absorbed vhe @xmath1-rays ( which is higher in the pure power - law case ) , the cascade spectra at energies below the @xmath2 absorption trough are virtually identical . in the cases relevant for this study ,",

    "<S> the discovery of very - high - energy ( vhe , @xmath0  gev ) @xmath1-ray emission from intermediate- and low - frequency peaked blazars suggests that @xmath2 absorption and pair cascading might occur in those objects . in previous papers , we investigated the compton emission from vhe @xmath1-ray induced pair cascades , deflected by moderate magnetic fields , in a largely model - independent way , and demonstrated that this emission can explain the fermi fluxes and spectra of the radio galaxies cen  a and ngc  1275 . in this paper , we describe a generalization of our monte - carlo cascade code to include the angle - dependent synchrotron output from the cascades , allowing for the application to situations with non - negligible magnetic fields , leading to potentially observable synchrotron signatures , but still not dominating the radiative energy loss of cascade particles . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the synchrotron radiation from the cascades in ngc  1275 and cen  a are negligible for the parameters used in our previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the magnetic field can not be determined from a fit of the cascade emission to the @xmath1-ray spectrum alone , and the degeneracy can only be lifted if the synchrotron emission from the cascades is observed as well . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this fact with the example of ngc  1275 . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the cascade synchrotron emission may produce spectral features in the same energy range in which the big blue bump is observed in the spectral energy distributions of several blazars , and may make a non - negligible contribution to this feature . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this idea with the example of 3c  279 . </S>"
