    "the interpretation of the number of lensed sources that are detected in a flux - limited survey depends critically on the factors by which the sources are magnified .",
    "lensed objects are drawn from a parent population with smaller fluxes than their unlensed counterparts .",
    "one therefore samples a fainter portion of the source luminosity function and a more distant range of source redshifts .",
    "this well - known `` magnification bias '' also affects the relative frequencies of different lens morphologies .",
    "four - image lenses",
    "are more highly magnified than two - image lenses , and are subject to a stronger magnification bias .    early studies of lens statistics used lens models with circular symmetry , such as singular isothermal spheres , for which the magnification bias is easy to calculate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , symmetric models only produce 2-image lenses and can not be used to interpret the statistics of each morphology separately .",

    "while numerical calculations are certainly valuable , they tend to obscure the roles of competing contributions to what is being calculated .",
    "analytic forms for such things as luminosity functions and magnifications may be no more accurate , but they produce results that are more readily understood .    with this motivation we examined a number of simple elliptical lens models and found one for which the mean magnification can be computed analytically , for both 2-image and 4-image lensing .",
    "the model is a singular isothermal sphere in an external shear field ( sis+xs ) , which is physically motivated and widely used .    in the next section",
    "we briefly review the mathematics and the qualitative features of lensing by non - circular potentials . in ",
    "[ sec : calculation ] , we specialize to the sis+xs and derive the analytic expressions for all of the relevant quantities , including the mean magnification .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : numerical ] we compare our result to the full numerical evaluation of the magnification distribution , and remark on applications to the interpretation of lensing statistics .",
    "lensing theory is well developed and has been expounded in detail by @xcite , among others .",
    "the particular problem of lensing by elongated potentials has been lucidly described by @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review only those concepts that are required to follow the calculations presented in   [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "we use the conventional definition of the lens potential , @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the newtonian gravitational potential of the galaxy ; @xmath4 is the sky - plane angular displacement ; @xmath5 is the line - of - sight coordinate ; and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the angular - diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and between lens and source , respectively . with this definition ,",
    "the correspondence between source position @xmath9 and image position @xmath4 is @xmath10 [ eq : lens - equation ] the inverse magnification of a particular image @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 which is negative when the image and source have opposite parity .",
    "for a survey in which sources are selected by total flux , the relevant quantity is the total magnification @xmath13 , the sum of the unsigned magnifications of all images of a source located at @xmath9 .",
    "most of the observed galaxy lenses can be described ( at least qualitatively ) using centrally concentrated , singular potentials .",
    "if the isopotential contours are only moderately elliptical , such potentials produce either 1 , 2 , or 4 images of a background source , in locations that can be understood with reference to the curves plotted in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : sisxs ] .",
    "the curves are plotted for the sis+xs , but the following discussion applies to many singular elliptical potentials .    for a source outside the _ radial caustic _ ,",
    "one image is produced outside the 12 _ transition locus_. a source on the radial caustic corresponds to one image on the 12 transition locus and another image at the origin , with zero flux .",
    "if the source moves from the radial caustic to the _ astroid caustic _ , the outer image moves to the outer 24 transition locus , while the inner image acquires a nonzero flux and moves to the inner 24 transition locus . on the astroid caustic ,",
    "three images are produced : one on each of the 24 transition loci ; and one on the _ critical curve _",
    ", with infinite flux .",
    "inside the astroid caustic , the latter image splits into two images with finite flux , and the result is one image in each of the regions marked `` 4 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] .",
    "the caustics and critical curve are well known to those who study gravitational lensing , but the transition loci receive less attention than they deserve  in particular , they are crucial for our calculation of mean magnification .    for more elongated potentials , two cusps of the astroid caustic pierce the radial caustic and are often referred to as `` naked cusps . ''",
    "the relevant curves in the source plane and the image plane are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : sisxs ] .",
    "a source inside a naked cusp corresponds to three images located on the same side of the origin as the source  one in each of the three regions marked `` 3 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] .",
    "if the source position is random , the cross section for producing 4 images , @xmath14 , is the total area within the 4-image region of the source plane ( marked `` 4 '' in figure  [ fig : sisxs ] ) .",
    "the 2-image cross - section is the area of the 2-image region , and the 3-image cross - section is the area of the 3-image region .",
    "the cross - section for multiple imaging is @xmath15 .",
    "the mean magnification for multiple - image lensing is the average value of the total magnification for all source positions that result in more than one ] where the integral of @xmath16 extends over the region in the image plane in which multiple images are found .",
    "[ eq : mean - magnification ] holds because the jacobian for the @xmath17 transformation is equal to the magnification .",
    "alternatively , one can visualize the calculation as follows . because lensing conserves surface brightness , a source consisting of uniform brightness in the region formed by the union of the caustics will result in an image of uniform brightness within the union of the transition loci .",
    "the mean magnification for multiple - image lensing , which we denote @xmath18 , is the ratio of the image area to the source area .",
    "the mean magnification of 4-image lenses , denoted @xmath19 , is the ratio of 4-image region of image space and the 4-image region of source space .",
    "the mean magnification of 2-image and 3-image lenses can be visualized in a similar manner .    of the approximately 100 observed cases of multiple - image gravitational lensing by galaxies , almost none require naked cusps for explanation .",
    "the one possible exception is apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite .",
    "because naked - cusp systems are apparently rare in nature , and because the calculations described below can not be done analytically for naked - cusp systems , in this paper most of our attention will be on systems in which the astroid caustic is interior to the radial caustic .    in that case , to find the cross - sections and mean magnifications for 2-image and 4-image lensing , it is sufficient to calculate the areas enclosed by the radial caustic ( @xmath20 ) , astroid caustic ( @xmath21 ) , the 12 transition locus ( @xmath22 ) , and the inner and outer 24 transition loci ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . as long as the astroid caustic is contained entirely within the radial caustic , we have : @xmath25",
