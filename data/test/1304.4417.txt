    "henceforth , the acronym fde wil be used to refer to this approach .",
    "so far , numerous applications of the fde - based method , using the ksced approach , have been presented in literature to study the interaction of non - covalently bound ( or weakly interacting ) molecular complexes or solvated molecules @xcite . in this cases in fact",
    "the nonadditive kinetic energy term can be efficiently approximated by means of semilocal approximations @xcite .",
    "however , because in the conventional formulation the use of ksced is limited to local / semilocal xc functionals , most studies have focused on hydrogen - bond and dipole - dipole systems , since these interactions are dominated by electrostatic and polarization effects that can be described relatively well at the semilocal level of theory @xcite .",

    "the presence of nonlocal and/or orbital - dependent terms makes however the direct implementation of the method rather involved .",
    "therefore , a practical computational scheme was proposed where these terms are approximated with local functionals @xcite .",
    "thus , in practice in the gks - fde method the electronic structure is evaluated using a nonlocal exchange operator for the intra - subsystem xc effects but with an embedding potential evaluated at the local / semilocal level of theory .",
    "a similar approximation was also proposed for the extention of the ksced to the use of orbital - dependent optimized effective potentials @xcite .",
    "the gks - fde method was tested for a variety of hydrogen bond and dipole - dipole interactions and proved to be a very good approach for embedded simulations with hybrid functionals @xcite .",
    "in particular , with respect to fde - based calculations employing semilocal xc functionals , it enables a general reduction of the embedding errors , because of the smaller overlap of subsystem densities at the hybrid level , and it allows a better description of subsystem properties due to the removal of most of the self - interaction error ( sie ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it makes it possible to extend the application of fde - based techniques to treat systems that are typically poorly described by semilocal xc functionals .",
    "an example of the latter is given by ground - state charge - transfer complexes ( also called donor - acceptor complexes ) .",
    "these systems derive in fact a considerable portion of their stabilization energy from an electron charge - transfer between two centers .",
    "thus , unlike for hydrogen bonds or dipole - dipole interactions , where electrostatic and polarization effects dominate , the interaction in charge - transfer complexes is largely determined by orbital interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "the description of ground - state charge - transfer complexes is very challenging for conventional semilocal xc functionals because of the sie inherent in these methods . on the other hand , a good performance",
    "is generally obtained for hybrid functionals , especially when rather large portions of hartree - fock exchange are included @xcite .",
    "similar results also concern the charge transfer between organic molecules and metal substrates @xcite .    due to the difficult application of dft - based methods using semilocal xc functionals to these systems , in the last years",
    "only few fde investigations treated ground - state charge - transfer complexes and related problems @xcite .",
    "some of them @xcite made use of complicated or _ ad hoc _",
    "reparametrized kinetic energy functionals in order to obtain improved kinetic embedding potentials and improve the description of the system .",
    "however , these kinetic functionals can not be routinely applied in fde calculations for large systems . on the other hand ,",
    "an extensive investigation of different kinetic energy functionals @xcite showed that most popular kinetic energy approximations perform similarly and reasonably well for complexes displaying small / moderate charge transfer , so that it appears reasonable to consider in such applications the same kinetic energy approximation as those commonly used for hydrogen bond and dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the role of the xc functionals in embedding calculations dealing with charge - transfer systems , instead , was not given much attention so far @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we cover this issue and demonstrate how hybrid functionals can be practically utilized within an embedding scheme to obtain an improvement of the performance in the description of embedded systems for a benchmark of charge - transfer complexes .",
    "the ksced @xcite and gks - fde @xcite approaches are implemented in the turbomole program package @xcite , version 6.4 .",
    "all calculations were performed using the _ fde _ script , which uses a freeze - and - thaw procedure @xcite to guarantee the full relaxation of the embedded ground - state electron density of both subsystems , until dipole moments of the embedded subsystems converged to @xmath13 au . a supermolecular def2-tzvppd @xcite basis set",
    "was employed in all calculations to expand the subsystem electron densities . a monomolecular ( or too small )",
    "basis set is in fact insufficient to carry on fde calculations with good accuracy , resulting in basis - set errors larger than the fde errors and the differences between the methods .",
    "the def2-tzvppd basis set adds diffuse basis functions to the def2-tzvpp @xcite basis set , thus granting an accurate representation for the electron densities even at the relatively large bonding distances characteristic of the systems under consideration .",

    "no approximation for the nonadditive exchange contribution to the embedding potential is required : the same exchange functional is used for the embedding potential , subsystem and conventional supermolecule ks calculations .",

    "was then obtained by computing the embedding density error @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the number of electrons . in the evaluation of @xmath24",
    "only valence densities were considered to avoid numerical problems related to the high value assumed by the electron density in the core regions and in consideration of the fact that the core density is not important for the determination of chemical and physical properties of interaction between the subsystems , which are of interest here .",

[ tab : enerr ] are dispersion - corrected and , because we use a supermolecular basis set , the basis set superposition error for the total - system calculation is treated in the same way in both dft and fde - based methods ( boys - bernardi correction @xcite ) . in tab .",

    "a first inspection of the results , focusing the attention on @xmath41 and @xmath43 , confirms the finding , well established in literature @xcite , that hybrid functionals outperform semilocal ones for the calculation of interaction energies of ground - state charge - transfer complexes .",
    "in fact , bhlyp with a mare of 16.63% is the most accurate method .",
    "however , when interaction energies from embedding calculations are considered ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , all methods yield rather similar performances with mares in the range 30 - 37% ( for a discussion of the issues related to the comparison of embedding binding energies with experimental or theoretical references see e.g. refs .",
    "this suggests that a strong error cancellation occurs for embedding calculations using semilocal functionals , while the cancellation is much less in the case of hybrid approaches .",
    "the reason for this behavior can be traced back to the fact that , in general , conventional semilocal functionals overestimate significantly the binding energy of charge - transfer complexes @xcite ( mse is largely positive ) while , on the other hand , when used in methods based on the fde theory they show usually a tendency to produce too low interaction energies ( @xmath47 is negative in most cases ) . on the contrary ,",
    "hybrid functionals are quite accurate for the calculation of the interaction energies of charge - transfer complexes and , at the same time , corresponding embedding calculations reproduce with good accuracy the parent supermolecular gks calculations .    concerning the error on embedding energies ( @xmath47 ) , we note that the methods using hybrid xc functionals definitely outperform the ones employing semilocal xc approximations , yielding average deviations more than twice smaller .",
    "this improvement can be partially reconduced , in analogy to what shown in refs .",
    ", to a smaller overlap of the subsystem densities ( i.e. to a smaller sie ) at the hybrid level , that leads to a reduction of the error on embedding energy .",
    "this effect is best recognized if we consider a set of systems where only one subsystem is varying , as for nh@xmath16 interacting with cl@xmath14 , clf , and f@xmath14 respectively . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath47 is increasing from 2.6 to about 7 mha when the cl atoms are replaced by f atoms and this increase nicely correlates to the fact that the fluorine atom is affected by a larger self - interaction error than chlorine , so that it is plagued by a stronger overestimation of the diffuseness of the electron density at semilocal level of theory .",
    "however , in general it is not possible to find a trend valid for all the systems due to the different details of the interaction when both subsystems are changed .",
    "in fact , despite the inclusion of exact exchange in the calculations may help to reduce the errors on embedding energies by lowering the effective overlap between the two subsystems , this is not the only effect determining the accuracy of the gks - fde energy calculations . in particular for hybrid methods still a subtle error compensation between kinetic , relaxation , and exchange contributions occurs .",
    "thus , to shed light on the different aspects determining the embedding energy error we can recur to the embedding energy decomposition introduced in ref .  .",

    "this result reflects the good quality of the electron densities computed with hybrid embedding methods ( see next section ) and evidences once more the importance of the density overlap in this context .",

    "the table shows the well - known tendency of the gga xc functionals to overestimate the charge transfer @xcite , so that blyp and pbe yield for @xmath57 mares well above 100% , while much better results ( mare of 17.5% ) are obtained by including a large fraction of exact exchange , as in bhlyp .",
    "however , a different situation is observed when embedding calculations are considered .",
    "these have , in fact , a marked tendency towards an underestimation of the charge transfer , compared to the corresponding supermolecular calculation on the whole system , probably related to the excessive repulsive character of the approximated embedding potential .",
    "this behavior is also much more pronounced for gga methods than for hybrids . as a consequence , the bhlyp results are slightly worsened compared to the reference mp2 ones when embedding is used , while the semilocal methods display a strong improvement .    in order to shine light on this finding",
    ", we consider that embedding densities computed at the semilocal level of theory , when used to compute the energy , provide higher energies for the complexes with respect to corresponding densities from supermolecular calculations ( semilocal functionals stabilize the energy of charge - transfer complexes by overestimating the charge transfer to compensate for the absence of long - range interactions @xcite ) .",
    "because , on the other hand , the isolated systems are not affected by this problem , this leads in general to a reduction of the computed binding energy ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : enerr ] ) , thus effectively compensating for the tendency of the semilocal xc functionals to over - bind .",
    "this explains the fact that in tab .",
    "[ tab : enerr ] , for semilocal functionals , @xmath42 has a much smaller mae and mare than @xmath43 .",
    "it is worth noting that the same considerations also apply to the hybrid approaches , but in these cases the effect is smaller .",
    "in fact , pbe0 binding energies are slightly improved ( on average ) when computed via an embedding approach , while bhlyp results end up to suffer from a slight underbinding .      in previous sections we evidenced the important role of the exact exchange for the description of embedding energies and densities , by comparing the performance of fde - based methods using semilocal xc functionals with that of gks - fde approaches using hybrid functionals based on exactly the same semilocal approximation . to push this",
    "investigation one step further here we consider more generally the family of one - parameter hybrid functionals        @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the hartree - fock exchange , @xmath62 is a parameter , and @xmath63 is the lee - yang - parr correlation energy functional @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : family ] ) reduces to blyp for @xmath64 , to bhlyp for @xmath65 , and was already used to study the role of exact exchange in embedding calculations of hydrogen - bond and dipole - dipole interacting systems in ref .  .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] reports , as a function of @xmath62 , the errors on the embedding energies for selected systems as well as the individual contributions @xmath66 and @xmath38 . for most of the systems the error @xmath47 is found to decrease with @xmath62 until @xmath67 , and then to slightly increase for larger values of the parameter .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of an error cancellation between the @xmath66 contribution ( middle panel ) , which starts from a rather large positive value and decreases with @xmath62 , and the @xmath38 term ( right panel ) , which shows instead an evident parabolic shape with minima located around @xmath68 and provides mostly negative contributions for @xmath69 .",
    "this behavior is quite different from the one observed for dipole - dipole and hydrogen - bond interactions ( see figure i of ref .  ) , which is generally characterized by positive contributions of @xmath38 , increasing with @xmath62 .",
    "the present finding thus shows that for charge - transfer systems a more delicate balancing must be found between the need to increase the exact - exchange contribution , in order to reduce the density overlap , and the necessity to obtain the correct description of long - range xc interactions in the hybrid functional .",
    "errors on the embedding density for selected systems as computed with the family of functionals of eq .",
    "( [ eq : family ] ) . in all calculations",
    "we used the revapbek functional for the non - additive kinetic energies and a supermolecular def2-tzvppd basis set . ]",
    "the family of one - parameter hybrid functionals can be also be employed to study the effect of the exact exchange on the description of embedded densities .",
    "the result of this study was already partially anticipated in previous sections and it is clearly shown in fig . [ adens ] : by increasing the amount of exact exchange the error on the embedding density is monotonically decreased . as mentioned in previous discussions and in ref .",
    "this behavior is mainly due to the reduction of the overlap of the subsystem densities consequent to the reduction of the sie .",
    "of course , the effect is somehow attenuated for very large values of the parameter @xmath62 because of the increased importance of the semilocal approximation used for the exchange term in the gks - fde scheme in these cases , as shown in right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "finally , we can consider the ability of methods including different amounts of exact exchange to correctly reproduce the charge transfer .",
    "we thus report in fig .",
    "[ ct_alpha ] the difference @xmath70 between the charge transfer computed for each value of @xmath62 , with or without the embedding treatment , and the reference values obtained from mp2 relaxed densities .",
    "the plot shows that considering full gks calculations the charge transfer is generally overestimated at the gga level and better agreement with the reference is only found when a significative amount of hartree - fock exchange is considered . on the other hand , for embedding calculations",
    "the gks charge transfer can be only reproduced when exact exchange is included , while calculations using a semilocal xc potential yield a strong underestimation with respect to the corresponding supermolecular calculation .",
    "in fact , the charge transfer computed from embedding methods appears to be almost independent from the percentage of exact exchange included in the xc functional . to understand these results we must consider that within fde - based methods the number of electrons on each subsystem is fixed a priori , so that no real charge transfer between them can occur .",
    "the charge transfer must be instead mimicked by a strong polarization of the two subsystem densities , in such a way that their sum will give the same spatial distribution as the electron density of the full system .",
    "the role of the embedding potential is thus to provide a polarization of the subsystems , while each subsystem must respond properly to this perturbation . in the case of semilocal functionals",
    "they are well known to provide a poor description of polarization @xcite , thus a poor description of charge transfer must be expected . on the contrary ,",
    "hybrid functionals have been shown to give a good response to polarization perturbations within the gks - fde scheme @xcite , thus they can provide a good reproduction of the charge transfer between the subsystems .     difference between the charge transfer computed with functionals defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : family ] ) and the reference mp2 value . in the left panel",
    "we report the results of gks calculations on whole systems ; in the right panel the corresponding embedding results are shown . in all calculations we used the revapbek functional for the non - additive kinetic energies and a supermolecular def2-tzvppd basis set .",
    "]      in an analysis of the performance of embedding methods for the simulation of ground - state charge - transfer complexes it is obviously interesting to study in details what is the relationship between the outcome of the calculations and the magnitude of the charge transfer .",
    "however , this study can not be performed straightforwardly by a simple comparison of different systems displaying different values of the charge transfer because in this way also many other details of the interaction are changed at the same time . for this reason in this section",
    "we prefer to focus the attention on a single system , namely the linear hcn - clf complex , and force a modulation of the charge transfer through the application of an external constant electric field directed along the axis of the complex .    in fig .",
    "[ field ] we report the error on embedding energy ( @xmath47 ) , the error on embedding density ( @xmath24 ) , and the error on the computed net charge on the dihalogen monomer clf ( @xmath71 ) as a function of the charge transfer induced ( at the gks level ) by the applied external field for the two functionals bhlyp and blyp .",
    "the corresponding electric field is reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ field ] .",
    "errors on embedding energy ( @xmath47 ) , embedding density ( @xmath24 ) , and the computed signed charge transfer on the dihalogen monomer clf ( @xmath71 ) as a function of the charge transfer induced ( at the gks level ) by the applied external field , for bhlyp and blyp .",
    "the inset reports the external electric field used to generate different charge transfer values . ]",
    "the figure shows that both functionals display the same behavior with the induced charge transfer , with all errors increasing as the charge transfer grows .",
    "in fact , the minima of the embedding errors are approximately located at zero charge transfer . the energy error decomposition ( not reported )",
    "confirms that the increase of the energy error is essentially due to a large increase in the kinetic and relaxation contributions .    moreover , the lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ field ] shows , in agreement with our analysis of previous sections , that the increase of charge transfer is in linear correspondence with an increase of the inaccuracy in its evaluation by embedding methods .",
    "this implies , as also shown by a comparison of the two upper panels of fig .",
    "[ field ] with the lower one , that the embedding errors are correlated ( almost linearly ) with the inaccuracy of embedding approaches to correctly describe the amount of charge transfer .",
    "all previous investigations have been carried out at reference geometries . however , for charge - transfer complexes large differences in the equilibrium geometry can be expected for different methods .",
    "in particular , hybrid xc functionals are able to produce equilibrium structures very close to the reference ones but semilocal xc approximations lead to significantly shorter intermolecular distances @xcite . as shown in ref .   the geometry and the intermolecular distance play an important role in determining the accuracy of embedding calculations .",
    "it is therefore interesting , in the present context , to assess this issue for the limits represented by the structures optimized at the semilocal blyp and hybrid bhlyp level .    to this end",
    "we consider in fig .",
    "[ geom ] the error on embedding energy ( @xmath47 ) , the error on embedding density ( @xmath24 ) , and the error on the computed monomer charge ( @xmath71 ) at different geometries interpolating linearly between the blyp and the bhlyp optimized geometries of the complex c@xmath14h@xmath15f@xmath14 ( similar results are found for other systems ) .",
    "the intermolecular distance between the f@xmath14 monomer and the plane of the ethylene is @xmath72    and @xmath73    for blyp and bhlyp , respectively .",
    "errors on embedding energy ( @xmath47 ) , embedding density ( @xmath24 ) , and the computed net charge on the ethylene monomer ( @xmath71 ) at different geometries interpolating between the blyp and bhlyp equilibrium geometry of the c@xmath14h@xmath15-f@xmath14 complex . in the inset the embedding error decomposition for the bhlyp case is reported . ]",
    "the figure shows the important role of the geometry for all the embedding results .",
    "this finding can be understood considering that at small intermolecular distances , i.e. at the blyp geometry , the overlap between the electron densities of the two subsystems rapidly grows . moreover , because at reduced distances between the subsystems the orbital interactions are enhanced , also the charge transfer is highly increased , together with the error in its evaluation . as a consequence , large errors can be expected for the embedded densities , due to the well - known limitations of nonadditive kinetic potentials for strongly overlapping densities @xcite . similarly , large errors are found for the embedding energies . in this case",
    "an energy decomposition of the bhlyp embedding error ( see inset of fig . [ geom ] ) further confirms that the increase of the error is essentially due to a large increase of the relaxation - kinetic term , while only a minor role is played by the exchange term @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , the latter being always opposite in sign to the relaxation - kinetic contribution provides a moderate error cancellation which improves the final performance of the hybrid method .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ geom ] indicate in conclusion that , for the simulation of charge - transfer complexes via embedding approaches , the semilocal methods may display serious problems related to the use of relaxed structures ( e.g. in geometry optimizations or molecular dynamics ) , beside the limitations already highlighted in the previous sections .",
    "therefore , the hybrid approaches appear definitely more robust in such applications .      in previous sections we showed that only embedding approaches making use of hybrid xc functionals can reproduce the ground - state charge transfer of the investigated complexes with reasonable accuracy , while a strong underestimation occurs when semilocal approaches are used .",
    "this fact has important consequences on the accuracy of embedding calculations , that nevertheless are partially , or even mostly , mitigated by error compensation effects .",
    "the improper description of the charge transfer can have however more subtle effects , especially on the one - electron spectrum of the subsystems .",
    "this is an important issue , since the molecular orbitals of the embedded subsystems can be used as the basis for an analysis of the properties of the interacting subsystems and/or as input quantities in response calculations @xcite .",
    "density of states ( dos ) for both gks and hybrid bhlyp ( upper panel ) and the semilocal blyp ( bottom panel ) embedding calculations on the charge - transfer complex nh@xmath16-f@xmath14 .",
    "the solid black line indicates gks dos of the whole system ; the red dashed and solid turquoise lines indicate dos from embedding calculations on the monomers nh@xmath16 and f@xmath14 respectively . in the insets",
    "the gks dos ( thick black line ) is compared with the sum of the two subsystems doss ( dashed magenta line ) .",
    "energy values are in ha . ]",
    "the driving force for ground - state charge transfer in molecular complexes is a sizable difference in the chemical potential between the constituting ( isolated ) subsystems , so that , when the subsystems start to interact , a fraction of the electron density must be moved from one fragment to another to equilibrate it .",
    "the final chemical potential of the complex is an average between those of the initial non - interacting subsystems and it is determining the offset for the kohn - sham potential , thus de facto fixing the energy of the molecular orbitals . in an ideal exact fde - based embedding calculation the embedding potential shall be able , by definition , to yield for the embedded subsystems the same chemical potential as for the full complex and , of course , shall induce a polarization able to mimic the exact charge - transfer . as a side consequence , the single - particle spectrum of the subsystems will be also correct ( as compared to the corresponding supermolecular calculation ) .",
    "similar conclusions apply for any approximated embedding calculation having sufficient accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , if the embedding procedure fails to reproduce the correct charge transfer ( i.e. correct with respect to the calculation on the full system ) , the polarization exerted by the embedding potential on the two subsystems will be insufficient , thus the chemical potential of the two fragments will be rather different from the one of the full system ( too large in one subsystem and too low in the other ) .",
    "consequently , the molecular orbitals of the two subsystems will lay at too high ( for one subsystem ) and too low energies ( for the other ) .",
    "the two cases described above fit very well to the embedding calculations based on hybrid and semilocal functionals , respectively .",
    "this is nicely shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] where , as an example , we report the density of states ( dos ) of the nh@xmath16-f@xmath14 complex compared to that of the two embedded subsystems as resulting from bhlyp and blyp embedding calculations .",
    "the comparison is in this case rather fair , since the two fragments composing the nh@xmath16-f@xmath14 complex interact only weakly so that the molecular orbitals of the full system can be easily attributed to either of the constituent subsystems .",
    "the figure shows very clearly that bhlyp embedding calculations yield subsystems orbitals which match well the ones from the full system ( within 0.01 ev ) . instead ,",
    "the orbitals from the blyp embedding calculations are systematically shifted with respect to the ones of the corresponding supermolecular calculation , with f@xmath14 orbitals shifted at lower energies and nh@xmath16 ones shifted at higher energies , consistently with the underestimation of charge transfer from nh@xmath16 to f@xmath14 .",
    "finally , we recall in favor of hybrid calculations that even supermolecular calculations using semilocal xc functionals provide a poor description of the single - particle spectrum , while better results can be only obtained by reducing the sie @xcite .",
    "we applied methods based on the frozen density embedding theory to study the electronic properties of ground - state charge - transfer complexes and to clarify the ability of such approaches to treat accurately this class of systems and interactions .",
    "this topic is of particular interest due to the growing popularity of embedding approaches in the field of computational chemistry and the importance of charge - transfer complexes in many chemical applications .",
    "however , to date , embedding calculations have been mainly presented for hydrogen - bond and dipole - dipole interactions , while only few applications dealt with systems where charge transfer plays a significant role @xcite .",
    "our work clarifies some of the motivations for this lack of embedding calculations concerning charge - transfer systems , showing that standard embedding approaches , making use of semilocal xc functionals , display several drawbacks in this context .",
    "moreover , despite they can generally yield interaction energies of good quality ( with respect to accurate references ) , this is due to a strong error cancellation effect and does not reflect a property of the corresponding kohn - sham supermolecular calculation . for these reasons and because semilocal xc functionals are known to perform rather poorly for charge - transfer complexes even in conventional kohn - sham supermolecular calculations , the use of such approaches does not appear appropriate .",
    "the introduction of the gks - fde method mitigates different problems in the fde - based calculations and thus provides a valuable tool to handle embedding calculations of charge - transfer systems .",
    "in fact , in the present work we showed the relevance of exact exchange contributions to reduce the embedding errors and improve the overall performance of the calculations , through a reduction of the coulomb self - interaction error and a better description of subsystems electronic properties .    in conclusion , fde - based approaches making use of hybrid",
