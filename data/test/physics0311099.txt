    "is considered to be an open system with respect to exchange of energy and numbers of electrons .",
    "they use a 3-state model with integer charge resonances representing the states of the ensemble for each atom . for atom",
    "a for instance , the gc energy is expressed in the form of an ensemble average @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the occupation numbers and @xmath12 are the energies for the integer charge species @xmath13 + , 0 , and @xmath14 .",

    "the nonlinearities in the occupation numbers as functions of charge introduced through temperature at physically reasonable temperatures are not sufficient to produce states with fractional charges .",
    "thus charge transfer as represented by an ensemble of weakly interacting integer - charge states is too simplistic to describe fractionally charged states .",
    "mm also examine a 3-state valence bond ( vb ) approach usqing the same resonance states as in the gc approach .",
    "this is equivalent to a 0 k ensemble where the states are allowed to interact .",
    "the vb approach is able to represent charge transfer processes with fractional charges .",
    "however , the representation of the energy depends on resonance matrix elements .",
    "the issue becomes one of defining sets of coefficients for the state wavefunctions that allow one to recover quadratic and gc - like energy expressions . using coulson charges@xcite as an approximation and a maximum entropy valence bond approach ( mevb ) , mm derive energy expressions as functions of @xmath2 with the forms of eqs .",

    "however , mm were unable to find a general expression linking the gc and classical electrostatic forms .",
    "the three main difficulties in deriving a charge dependent potential are the same ones facing mm and others .",
    "first is to define the charge , second is to evaluate or eliminate the resonance energy matrix elements , and third is to define the energy for a particular value of @xmath2 .",
    "first , to define @xmath2 , we invoke a density - functional - theory@xcite ( dft ) motivated atom - in - molecule@xcite pseudo - atom concept within the context of the evb approach .",
    "we assume the availability of a practical density decomposition strategy@xcite to define the pseudo - atom densities .",
    "the charge is defined as an average over the difference between two pseudo - atom densities .",
    "no restriction to coulson@xcite or other definitions of charge@xcite is necessary .",
    "the dependence of the evb wavefunction on @xmath2 is then deduced , which in turn yields an energy for arbitrary @xmath2 , not just the optimum @xmath2 .",
    "second , to evaluate resonance energy matrix elements , we retain the vb approach of mm , but use an empirical valence bond ( evb)@xcite strategy , rather than explicitly evaluating a model hamiltonian or using the mevb averaging procedure of mm .",
    "specifically , a reference energy is separated out for a fixed value of @xmath2 . to define the energy for an atom in the molecule , we require consistency between the evb wavefunction energy and dft energy for each atom . in so doing we are able to cast the energy of each atom into a form suitable for constructing empirical potential energy surfaces that could be used in simulations of larger systems .",
    "third , the typical situation is that there are many wavefuctions and many electron densities that are consistent with a particular @xmath2 . to define a unique energy from among the possible choices , we adhere to constrained search density functional theory ( cs - dft)@xcite rather than appealing to a maximum entropy principle .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the evb method has not previously been combined with an atom - in - molecule approach.@xcite von szentply and coworkers define atomic charges , but their definition is implicitly limited to a quadratic dependence.@xcite grochowski and coworkers@xcite use evb parameterized by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for key molecular fragments and for defining the charges .",
    "the charges are defined with a phenomenological spatial dependence that does maintain correct dissociation to neutrals .",
    "furthermore , the charge dependence of the final potential is purely electrostatic .",
    "the inconsistency between the gc and classical electrostatic forms is explained in ciosowski and stefanov@xcite using a different definition of @xmath2 , which is based on the total system wavefunction .",
    "the charge is expressed as a perturbation on the molecular hamiltonian @xmath16 . computed atom - in - molecule equilibrium charges are used in subsequent `` charge - constrained '' calculations to study the energy and electronegativity dependences about the ground - state atom - in - molecule charges .",
    "nalewajski@xcite provides a simplified rendition of ciosowski and stefanov , but only for orthogonal resonance states . while physically correct , these efforts have not been cast in the form of general purpose potential energy surfaces . in particular , neither attempts to resolve the resonance energy issue in a way that is tractable for large - scale simulations .",
    "here we derive a charge - dependent empirical potential which faithfully represents charge transfer as a function of separation between atom a and an entity b. in the simplest case , entity b is another atom . more generally , b represents a collective embedding environment or reservior.@xcite the charge may be fractional .",
    "our primary interest is in deriving a general functional form with correct physical and chemical behavior at all interaction strengths rather than providing an exact treatment of particular terms or systems .",
    "the three difficulties just outlined are addressed .",
    "we then analyze these potentials in special limiting cases and in the light of the results of ciosowski and stefanov@xcite and nalewajski.@xcite finally , we derive general models for both pair potentials and atom - in - molecule energies .",

    "its advantage is that the component contributions of the essential states that are thought to represent the physical system are delineated .",
    "a diagonal representation of @xmath67 when state mixing is important can be devised by diagonalizing @xmath16 .",
    "for the purposes of extending the present treatment to finite temperature ensembles,@xcite this particular diagonalization of @xmath67 would be useful .",
    "the @xmath25-electron densities of interest are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "they bear the usual relationships to the respective @xmath25-electron density matrices , @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the 3(@xmath25 - 1 ) dimensional spatial electronic coordinates and @xmath75 is either `` @xmath59 '' , `` @xmath76 '' , `` @xmath60 '' , or no subscript .",

    "additional ambiguity in @xmath102 arises from the choices for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these ambiguities lie behind the designation of the present approach as an empirical one .",

    "this expression is consistent with the results of ciosowski and stefanov,@xcite which are derived from a perturbative technique . as noted previously , even if @xmath9 , @xmath28 equals either 0 or @xmath108 .",
    "this is because the evb model describes state mixing even when there is no charge transfer .",
    "for example , in the @xmath109 molecule , the covalent and ionic wavefunctions mix at all finite separations , but the ground state never involves charge transfer .",
