    "clarification of the chiral phase transition and the confinement / deconfinement transition are the longstanding central issues in qcd .",
    "there have been numerous efforts to understand the phase structure of qcd at zero and finite temperature or density regions  @xcite .",
    "chiral phase transition is detected by monitoring the order parameter , chiral condensate @xmath2 , whereas a polyakov loop is widely used in order to know whether a system is in the confinement phase or not .",
    "the expectation value of a polyakov loop is zero when a system is in the confinement phase , and it can be finite in the deconfinement phase . a polyakov loop may be considered as an order parameter for the color confinement .",
    "these two `` order parameters '' unfortunately do not go together .",
    "( interestingly , a polyakov loop and dirac eigenvalues , which also reflect the chiral phase transition , can be related  @xcite . ) while chiral condensate @xmath3 can be a good order parameter if we neglect the small current quark masses , a polyakov loop can serve as an order parameter only in pure gauge systems without quarks ( or with infinitely heavy quarks ) , where deconfinement transition is expressed by the spontaneous @xmath4-symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of dynamical quarks explicitly breaks the @xmath4 symmetry and a polyakov loop results in an approximate order parameter .",
    "the color fields induced by a polyakov loop is readily screened by the dynamical quark loops that twist along the euclidean time direction .",
    "nevertheless , a polyakov loop surely reflects the confinement nature and has been used in many studies .",
    "it may be however desired to clarify the confinement nature in a clearer manner .",
    "for example , the chiral symmetry breaking surely has an impact on the properties of quarks .",
    "current quarks would change their natures due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking acquiring the large effective masses  @xcite , and therefore a polyakov loop screened by `` constituent '' quarks could be affected by the chiral phase transition .",
    "the apparent coincidence of the critical temperatures for the chiral and confinement transitions is still under debate . even if we evaluate a polyakov loop correlator @xmath5 , it is not so straightforward to clarify the color - confinement nature since we always have string - breaking effects . in high - density systems ,",
    "the concept of color confinement could be obscure .",
    "quarks may freely move from one hadron to another in sufficiently dense hadronic systems , even if the vacuum is still in `` color confinement '' phase .",
    "in fact , `` quarkyonic '' phase has been proposed recently  @xcite , where quarks are confined but their degrees of freedom can dominate the system . in any case , as long as we insist on a polyakov loop , it is needed to single out the vacuum property independently of the direct charge - screening effects .",
    "search for order parameters have a long - standing history , and several studies have been performed so far  @xcite .",
    "we consider prescriptions that remove the dynamical quark loops which directly screen the color fields from a polyakov loop .",
    "we introduce the basic ideas  @xcite in this section to make this paper self - contained .",
    "we assume su(3 ) lattice gauge theory with single quark - flavor in what follows .",
    "( extensions to other cases are simple . )",
    "the qcd partition function is expressed as @xmath6},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 a ( lattice ) dirac operator , in which non - zero chemical potential can be introduced , and @xmath8 $ ] being the gauge action . in advance of the gauge fields integration , quark fields are integrated out , and all the quark dynamics is encoded in @xmath9 . the quark loops that can directly screen the color fields from a polyakov loop originate from such a fermionic determinant .",
    "this fermionic determinant can be expanded in terms of two types of quark loops ( see fig .",
    "[ loops ] ) ; ordinary quark loops and wraparound quark loops .",
    "ordinary loops exist entirely in a system and can be smoothly shrunk .",
    "wraparound loops twist along the imaginary - time direction , and they are the very loops that can directly screen a polyakov loop .",
    "such wraparound loops are also responsible for the finiteness of quark density at finite chemical potential , and are important ingredients .",
    "schematic figure for the expansion of a fermionic determinant in terms of quark loops . ]    a fermionic determinant can be generally divided into three terms ; @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) the terms which contain @xmath13 wraparound quark loops , respectively .",
    "here @xmath14 is an integer and can be negative , and a wraparound anti - quark loop is counted as @xmath15 .",
    "one connected quark loop which twists @xmath16-times along the euclidean time direction is counted as @xmath16 quark loops .",
    "the total number of quark loops is defined as a net number : in case a contribution contains as many wraparound quark loops as wraparound anti - quark loops , the number is defined as zero .",
    "we concentrate only on wraparound loops , since ordinary quark loops are irrelevant in the following argument .",
    "next , we consider the uniform @xmath4 transformation ; @xmath17 with @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 are the link variables on a lattice .",
    "by such a transformation , a polyakov loop @xmath0 is rotated as @xmath20 .",
    "this @xmath4 transformation also affects dynamical ( wraparound ) quark loops , and @xmath11 are transformed as @xmath21 . using this property",
    ", we can single out each @xmath11 by means of such @xmath4 link - variable transformations . denoting the fermionic determinant after @xmath22-times such @xmath4 transformations as @xmath23",
    ", @xmath11 can be obtained as @xmath24 ( see earlier works  @xcite . ) with vanishing quark chemical potential , @xmath25 and @xmath26 hold due to the charge conjugation symmetry . as we have mentioned above , @xmath11 contains @xmath13 wraparound quark loops , and hence what screens the polyakov loop s color fields are the quarks encoded in @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , the complex phase associated with @xmath27 rotates a polyakov loop into the real sector .",
    "( @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not . )",
    "the important note is that quarks in @xmath28 and @xmath29 can not screen a fundamental charge completely .",
    "then , if we evaluate only @xmath28 , the response of a polyakov loop would be the same as that obtained in a quenched system .",
    "@xmath28 is in fact @xmath4-transformation invariant and does not cause the explicit @xmath4-symmetry breaking .",
    "we note here that this removal of the explicit @xmath4-symmetry breaking is essentially different from the quark - loop quenching . evaluating @xmath11 corresponds to computing the partition function @xmath30 in the @xmath31-triality sector ( @xmath32 ) , latexmath:[\\[{\\mathcal z}_i = \\sum_{|3k+i\\rangle } \\langle 3k+i|",
    "e^{-\\beta \\hat h}\\     possible states that contain @xmath13 net quarks ( @xmath14 is an arbitrary integer ) .",
    "the vacuum still contains dynamical quark loops , and if the quark chemical potential is finite , there will exist @xmath34 net quarks ( @xmath14 net `` baryons '' ) in the system .",
    "string - breaking phenomena caused by dynamical quarks will be also reproduced .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a projection does not change thermal properties .",
    "we expect that it would be possible to unambiguously clarify the confining property of a vacuum independently of the direct charge - screening effect by dynamical quarks .",
    "( if we employ an anti polyakov loop , the roles of @xmath29 and @xmath27 switch positions with each other . )",
    "in this subsection , we individually and explicitly investigate the distributions of a polyakov loop evaluated with @xmath35 .",
    "we generate quenched gauge configurations with the plaquette action at @xmath36 on @xmath37 lattice , and perform reweighting using @xmath11 as well as the full determinant @xmath38 generated with the wilson fermion at @xmath39 .",
    "[ z3bk](upper ) and fig .",
    "[ z3bk](lower ) are the polyakov - loop distributions in the complex plain evaluated with @xmath38 and @xmath28 , respectively , at @xmath40 , where the broken @xmath4 symmetry is observed .",
    "as expected , the strength in the real sector is much enhanced by the effect of @xmath38 , which can be seen in fig .  [ z3bk](upper ) . on the other hand ,",
    "[ z3bk](lower ) shows the similar strength to the quenched case , which was expected in the previous section .",
    "especially one can find a three - peak structure in the complex plain .",
    "we show the same plots obtained at @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ z3ok ] , where no @xmath4 breaking can be found .",
    "the strength in the real sector is again ( but weakly ) enhanced by the effect of @xmath38 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ z3ok](upper ) , whereas fig .",
    "[ z3ok](lower ) shows the similar distributions to the quenched system .",
    "this prescription , where we measure a polyakov loop in zero - triality backgrounds ( evaluating @xmath28 ) , is free from the direct screening effects or the string - breaking effects by quark loops , and seems to enable us to clarify the confining nature of a vacuum .    for further clarification , we present the distributions reweighted with @xmath1 in fig .  [ d1d2 ] .",
    "one can observe that only @xmath27 can rotate a polyakov loop into the real sector , which implies that directly - screening quarks are coming from @xmath27 .",
    "the polyakov loops evaluated with @xmath29 are rather uniformly distributed around the origin .",
    "then , @xmath29 or @xmath42 may be also employed for this prescription .",
    "the nonvanishing polyakov loops are sometimes related to the explicit @xmath4-symmetry breaking caused by fermions . including @xmath29 actually breaks the @xmath4 symmetry explicitly , but it gives a similar polyakov loop distribution to the @xmath4-symmetric quenched case , which is natural if we take into account that quarks in @xmath29 can not screen a polyakov loop completely and hence the situation is physically similar to the quenched system .",
    "so far , the response of the polyakov loop evaluated with @xmath28 has been simply similar to the quenched case , and the difference is unclear . in order to show the difference",
    ", we perform a test with non - vanishing quark chemical potentials .",
    "we hereafter focus on the phase angles of @xmath28 and @xmath38 at finite chemical potential .",
    "( averaging the fermionic determinants at finite chemical potential was suggested and performed some years ago in the context of the reduction of phase fluctuations  @xcite . )    fig .",
    "[ phases ] shows the phase angles of @xmath28 and @xmath38 obtained at @xmath40 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , with one gauge configuration .",
    "the phase angle of the full determinant @xmath38 grows as we increase the chemical potential @xmath45 , which is caused by the asymmetry between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "however , as can be found in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , the phase angle of @xmath28 remains zero in the small-@xmath45 region , and rapidly grows above some value of @xmath45 .",
    "the reason for this behavior would be that the number of wraparound quarks in @xmath28 is @xmath34 . when @xmath45 is small enough , it is not likely for the system to accommodate three net quarks , and @xmath28 is still symmetric between quarks and anti - quarks , which implies @xmath46 .",
    "the phase angle at small-@xmath45 region is brought about by @xmath29 and @xmath27 . at large @xmath45 ,",
    "the charge conjugation symmetry in @xmath28 is largely broken , and the phase angle can be finite , which implies @xmath47 .",
    "the phase angles of @xmath28 and @xmath38 obtained as a function of chemical potential @xmath45 are plotted .",
    "they were evaluated with one gauge configuration . ]",
    "we next take a look of the distributions of fermionic determinants themselves in quenched qcd in this subsection . fig .",
    "[ distfd ] shows the distributions of @xmath29 in the complex plain computed at @xmath48(upper ) and @xmath49(lower ) .",
    "these distributions are qualitatively similar to the polyakov - loop distributions evaluated with @xmath28 .",
    "such behaviors can be understood intuitively : @xmath29 contains @xmath50 wraparound quark loops , and hence corresponds to the free energy of @xmath50 light quarks  @xcite .",
    "the physical situation is similar to the @xmath34-quark vacuum ( obtained by evaluating @xmath28 ) with one polyakov loop , where @xmath50 net charges exist .",
    "@xmath1 can be another candidate for an order parameter  @xcite .",

    "@xmath51 as well as a polyakov loop evaluated in zero - triality sector also seems usable for the clarification of the color confinement .    if we allow non - zero triality sectors in unquenched gauge - updation processes ( ordinary updations ) , the order parameter should be @xmath56 , which also turns out to be the original form proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( eq.([dmop ] ) ) . this implementation",
    ", however , would not be suitable for such purposes , simply because ergodicity is worse .",
    "though the configurations that have smaller statistical weights @xmath57 will produce larger @xmath56 and @xmath4 symmetry in @xmath58 could be finally recovered , such configurations would less appear in actual calculations .",
    "we note here that the inevitable failure of such treatments in the thermodynamic limit was discussed in ref .",
    "even so , if we directly measure @xmath59 in quenched backgrounds ( like our analyses in this paper and the original form in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the ergodicity itself is not lost  @xcite and this simple prescription could be valid , though it is time - consuming .      the deconfinement phase transition ,",
    "if it exists , would be detected still as the spontaneous @xmath4-symmetry breaking , as in the quenched case .",
    "( even when the transition is crossover , the argument is not invalidated . )",
    "we have to introduce a small explicit @xmath4-symmetry breaking effect and take the thermodynamic limit before removing the explicit breaking , in finite volume systems .",
    "practically , it will be workable for the detection of transition to evaluate @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 is a polyakov loop @xmath0 or the fermionic determinants @xmath1 .",
    "especially , the fluctuation of @xmath1 is much suppressed than that of a polyakov loop in zero - triality sector , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ distfd](upper ) : the values of @xmath1 are very sharply distributed on the @xmath4-axes , and we can find three `` lines '' in the complex plain . in any case , the use of @xmath1 seems much more advantageous than a polyakov loop , since it gives us more clearer signals .",
    "the reason for the tiny deviations from the @xmath4 axes in fig .  [ distfd](upper ) is the discontinuous behavior in @xmath62 in the deconfined phase . to see this , we compute @xmath29 on the gauge configurations where polyakov - loop s absolute values are less than 0.4 .",
    "such polyakov - loop s distributions are round - shaped both at @xmath36(deconfined ) and 5.0(confined ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath29 at @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ distfd04](upper ) ) still reproduces the three - peak structure , which implies @xmath29 at small @xmath63 also reflects the phase . to have a closer look",
    ", we classify configurations into three categories , sector 1 ( @xmath64 ) , sector 2 ( @xmath65 ) , sector 3 ( @xmath66 ) , in terms of the phase angle ( @xmath67 ) of a polyakov loop .",
    "the scatter plot of @xmath29 in each sector can be found in fig .",
