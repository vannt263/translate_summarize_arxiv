    "geometry plays a fundamental role in physics . in modern quantum theory",
    ", this idea has been perpetrated through many proposals of geometrization of quantum information resources , e.g. , entanglement  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", geometric approaches have also been extended for more general quantum correlation measures . in this scenario ,",
    "special focus has been given to quantum discord ( qd ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) , which is an information - theoretic measure of non - classical correlations originally proposed by ollivier and zurek  @xcite through an entropic ( non - geometric ) approach .",
    "the geometrization of qd , named as geometric quantum discord ( gqd ) , has been proposed by daki , vedral , and brukner  @xcite , mainly motivated by the difficulty of extracting analytical solutions for the entropic version of qd .",
    "gqd , as originally defined , can be seen as a deformation of the entropic qd  @xcite and quantifies the amount of quantum correlations in terms of its minimal hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of classical states .",
    "its evaluation is analytically computable for general two - qubit states @xcite as well as for arbitrary bipartite states @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown to exhibit operational significance in specific quantum communication protocols ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "despite those remarkable features , gqd is known to be sensitive to the choice of distance measures ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in turn , as recently pointed out  @xcite , gqd as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be regarded as a good measure for the quantumness of correlations , since it may increase under local operations on the unmeasured subsystem . in particular , it has explicitly been shown by piani in ref .",
    "@xcite that the simple introduction of a factorized local ancillary state on the unmeasured party changes the geometric discord by a factor given by the purity of the ancilla . from a technical point of view",
    ", the root of this drawback is the lack of contractivity of the hilbert - schmidt norm under trace - preserving quantum channels .",
    "remarkably , this problem can be completely solved if schatten 1-norm ( trace norm ) is adopted as a distance measure . indeed , concerning general schatten @xmath0-norms for a geometric definition of qd  @xcite ,",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the 1-norm is the only @xmath0-norm able to consistently define gqd ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the 1-norm gqd under the effect of decoherence .",
    "more specifically , we consider bell - diagonal states going through markovian local quantum channels that preserve the bell - diagonal form . for these states ,",
    "we analytically provide the 1-norm gqd as a function of the decoherence probability .",
    "in particular , we show that the 1-norm gqd may exhibit double sudden changes and freezing behavior during its evolution . concerning double sudden changes , its occurrence for bell - diagonal states under the simplest markovian evolutions",
    "is a new feature that have not been found for both the entropic  @xcite and the schatten 2-norm geometric  @xcite qd .",
    "specifically about the freezing behavior for general bell - diagonal states under markovian noise , it also occurs for the entropic qd  @xcite , being interpreted as a sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence .",
    "we illustrate double sudden changes and freezing of the 1-norm gqd through simple examples .",
    "moreover , we also consider the dynamical properties of quantum correlations in the xxz quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit , showing a connection between the occurrence of sudden changes and the quantum phases of the xxz model .",
    "let us begin by considering a bipartite system @xmath1 in a hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "the system is characterized by quantum states described by density operators @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the set of bound , positive - semidefinite operators acting on @xmath5 with trace given by @xmath6=1 $ ] .",
    "the 1-norm gqd between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is defined through the trace distance between @xmath9 and the closest classical - quantum state @xmath10 , reading @xmath11 where @xmath12 $ ] is the @xmath13-norm ( trace norm ) and @xmath14 is the set of classical - quantum states , whose general form is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 denoting a set of orthogonal projectors for subsystem @xmath7 , and @xmath19 a general reduced density operator for subsystem @xmath8 .",
    "we will focus here in the particular case of two - qubit bell diagonal states , whose density operator presents the form @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the identity matrix , @xmath22 is a three - dimensional vector such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a vector composed by pauli matrices . in matrix notation , we have @xmath25the minimization over the whole set of classical states was obtained for gqd as defined by the 2-norm  @xcite and by the relative entropy  @xcite . for those cases , it can be proved that the minimal state is a decohered ( measured ) state , i.e. the minimization runs over classical states of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is an unitary vector . for the 1-norm gqd ,",
    "minimization over decohered states has also been shown to be sufficient for the case of bell - diagonal states  @xcite . in this case , the 1-norm gqd can be analytically computed , yielding  @xcite @xmath30 ,   \\label{1normgd}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 $ ] describes the _ intermediate _ result among the absolute values of the correlation functions @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 . more specifically , for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 )",
    ", we attribute @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "remarkably , this is equivalent to the _ negativity of quantumness _ , which is a measure of nonclassicality recently introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimentally discussed in ref .",
    "then , for bell - diagonal states , by investigating the general behavior of the 1-norm gqd under decoherence , we are automatically providing the behavior of the negativity of quantumness under decoherence .",
    "we will consider the system - environment interaction through the operator - sum representation formalism  @xcite . in this context",
    ", we will take the evolution of a quantum state @xmath9 as described by a trace - preserving quantum operation @xmath38 , which is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the set of kraus operators associated to a decohering process of a single qubit , with the trace - preserving condition reading @xmath41 .",
    "we provide in table  [ t1 ] a list of kraus operators for a variety of channels considered in this work .",
    ".kraus operators for the quantum channels : bit flip ( bf ) , phase flip ( pf ) , bit - phase flip ( bpf ) , and generalized amplitude damping ( gad ) , where @xmath0 and @xmath42 are decoherence probabilities . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a specific example , we consider the decoherence behavior for the bf flip channel in the three quantum regimes governed by the anisotropy @xmath43 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "as we can see , the sudden change behavior that is present in the antiferromagnetic phase ( @xmath44 in the plot ) disappears in the gapless phase ( @xmath45 in the plot ) , characterizing the infinite - order quantum phase transition of the xxz chain .",
    "therefore , decoherence turns out to be a probe for the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point .",
    "such a characterization is a particular feature of the xxz chain , holding possibly also for related models , but not implying a general approach for quantum criticality . for the entropic",
    "qd , a detection of quantum phase transitions in terms of sudden change behavior has recently been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( color online ) sudden change behavior for first neighbors in the ground state of the xxz chain under the bf channel .",
    "distinct phases may exhibit different behaviors , going from monotonic decay ( @xmath46 ) to sudden change dynamics ( @xmath47 ) . ]",
    "we have analytically investigated the 1-norm gqd under the effect of markovian noise for bell - diagonal states . in particular , we have shown that , for the simplest cases of markovian dynamics , the 1-norm gqd may already exhibit double sudden changes or freezing behavior .",
    "the origin of such features is the robustness of qd under decoherence .",
    "this inherent robustness can be traced back as a consequence of the negligibility of the set of classical states ( zero discord states ) in comparison with the whole state space  @xcite .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the set of separable ( nonentangled ) states , which exhibits finite volume in state space .",
    "this implies , e.g. in the possibility of sudden death for entanglement , while just sudden changes ( typically with no death ) in the case of qd . specifically concerning the 1-norm gqd",
    ", it inherits this robustness of qd against noise and reveals it for simple bell - diagonal states , which is a by - product of the trace norm properties .",
    "experimental investigations of single sudden changes and freezing behavior have been realized through different physical setups  @xcite , which have demonstrated that such phenomena are quite general in real conditions .",
    "remarkably , a recent investigation  @xcite experimentally verified the single sudden change and the correlation freezing for the negativity of quantumness in bell - diagonal states , which turns out to be equivalent to the 1-norm gqd .",
    "therefore , further experiments aiming at those properties and also at double sudden changes could greatly benefit from the correlation dynamics derived in this work .",
    "moreover , we have found a surprising connection between the sudden change behavior and the infinite - order quantum phase transition in the xxz model .",
    "such kind of connections appear as a promising direction for investigating quantum criticality .",
    "we leave these possibilities as future challenges , as well as generalizations for more general states and for non - markovian dynamics .",
