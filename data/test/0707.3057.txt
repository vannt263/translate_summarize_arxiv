    "one of the astronomy research fields which have been more impressively impacted by the advent of hst is the study of the star formation histories ( sfh ) of resolved stellar populations .",
    "the superior photometric performances of hst have allowed the resolution of individual stars to unprecedented ( and still unequalled ) levels of faintness , distance and crowding . such an outstanding resolving power has triggered a large number of hst programs aimed at the derivation of the sfh of galaxies in the local universe , involving many people on both sides of the atlantic ocean .",
    "these studies have significantly improved our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the impacts of european astronomy and of hst in the field are briefly summarized in the following .",
    "= 19 , e(b - v)=0.08 , and with the photometric errors and incompleteness typical of hst / wfpc2 photometry .",
    "all the shown synthetic cmds contain 50000 stars and are based on the z=0.004 padova models @xcite .",
    "top - left panel : the case of a sfr constant from 13 gyr ago to the present epoch .",
    "top - right panel : the effect of concentrating in the last 20 myr the formation of all the stars which were born in the last 100 myr in the previous case .",
    "the cmd has a much brighter and thicker blue plume .",
    "bottom - left panel : same constant sfr as in the first case , but with a quiescent interval between 3 and 2 gyrs ago ; a gap appears in the cmd region delimited by the 2 and 3 gyr isochrones .",
    "bottom - right panel : exponentially decreasing sfr over the whole hubble time , with e - folding time 5 gyr ; the blue plume contains much fewer stars than in the constant sfr case , and the late evolutionary phases ( rgb , red clump , blue loops ) are also differently populated , with fewer stars in the younger sequences . ,",
    "height=491 ]    the whole business of deriving the sfh of nearby galaxies from the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of their resolved stars started in europe , when the synthetic cmd method was developped several years ago @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the well known circumstance that the location of any star in the cmd is uniquely related to its mass , age and chemical composition .",
    "this makes the cmd the best tool to infer the age of stellar systems . in the case of simple stellar populations ,",
    "i.e. coeval stars with the same chemical composition , isochrone fitting is the most frequently used method to infer the system age . in the case of galaxies , with rather complicated mixtures of different stellar generations , the age determination is less straightforward , but their cmds remain the best tool to derive the sfh .",
    "fig.[syn1 ] shows the effect of different sfhs on the cmd of a hypothetical galactic region with the intrinsic and photometric properties typical of a region in the smc observed with hst / wfpc2 .",
    "if the star formation rate ( sfr ) has been constant for all the galaxy lifetime , the cmd of the region is expected to have the morphology of the top - left panel , with a prominent blue plume mostly populated by main - sequence ( ms ) stars and an equally prominent red plume resulting from the overposition of old subgiants , red giant branch ( rgb ) , horizontal branch ( hb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , with younger stars in the agb , blue loops and red supergiant phases .",
    "if we change the sfh , not dramatically , but simply introducing quiescent and/or more intense phases , or assuming a shorter e - folding time for the sfr , the morphology of the cmd changes significantly , as visible in the other panels of fig.[syn1 ] .",
    "the tight dependence of the cmd morphology on the sfh is the cornerstone of the synthetic cmd method , which consists in comparing the observational cmd of a galactic region with synthetic cmds created via montecarlo extractions on stellar evolution tracks or isochrones for a variety of sfhs , imfs and age - metallicity relations ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed description of different procedures )",
    ".    the method does not provide unique solutions , but significantly reduces the possible sfh scenarios . since its first applications to photometric data from ground - based , moderate size telescopes , the synthetic cmd method demonstrated its power , showing that even in tiny galaxies such as local group dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) the sfh varies from one region to the other and that their star formation regime is rather continuous , with long episodes of moderate activity , separated by short quiescent intervals ( the so - called gasping regime , @xcite ) .",
    "when the first non - aberrated images were acquired with hst , the impressive improvement in the achievable photometric resolution and depth , and the corresponding quantum leap in the quality of the cmds , triggered a worldwide burst of interest in the derivation of the sfhs of nearby galaxies and in the synthetic cmd method .",
    "many people developped their own procedures and a few years later already @xmath010 different groups participated to an experiment organized in coimbra ( portugal ) to compare with each other the results from different procedures ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the experiment showed that most of the procedures provided consistent results and brought further interest to the field .",
    "since then , many studies have been performed to infer the sfh of almost all the dwarf galaxies in the local group ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the hst cameras also allows us to spatially resolve the sfh in the closest galaxies .",
    "for instance @xcite and @xcite have resolved and measured the sf activity over the last 0.5 gyr in the various sub - regions of the dirrs gr8 and sextans a , close to the borders of the local group .",
    "the resulting space / time distribution of the sf , with lightening and fading of adjacent cells , is intriguingly reminiscent of the predictions of the stochastic self - propagating sf theory proposed by @xcite almost 30 years ago .",
    "the hst / acs provides spectacularly deep and spatially resolved images , such as those of the star forming region ngc346 in the smc , where @xcite and @xcite have been able to measure 85000 stars , from very old to very young ones , including , for the first time in the smc , pre - main - sequence objects of mass from 3 to 0.6 m@xmath1 .",
    "the famous cmd of an andromeda region by @xcite showed that detailed sfhs can be finally derived also for external spirals .    in galaxies beyond the local group ,",
    "distance makes crowding more severe , and even hst can not resolve stars as faint as the ms turn - off of old populations .",
    "the higher the distance , the worse the crowding conditions , and the shorter the lookback time reachable even with the deepest , highest resolution photometry ( see fig.2 in @xcite ) . depending on distance and intrinsic crowding , the reachable lookback time in galaxies more than 1",
    "mpc away ranges from several gyrs ( in the best cases , when the rgb or even the hb are clearly identified ) , to several hundreds myr ( when agb stars are recognized ) , to a few tens myr ( when only the brightest supergiants are resolved ) .",
    "since the local group does nt host all types of galaxies , with the notable and unfortunate absence of the most ( ellipticals ) and the least ( blue compact dwarfs , bcds ) evolved ones , a few groups have embarqued in the challenging task of deriving the sfh of more distant galaxies . in spite of the larger uncertainties and the shorter lookback time ,",
    "these studies have led to quite interesting results , which would nt have been possible without hst .",
    "the case of ngc1705 is particularly instructive .",
    "the hst / wfpc2 photometry was deep and good enough to let us resolve individual stars from the most central regions to the extreme outskirts @xcite .",
    "we have been able to divide the galaxy in roughly concentric regions , all sufficiently populated by resolved stars , and derive the sf history of each region .",
    "young massive stars are concentrated at the center and their percentage rapidly decreases outwards , while faint red stars are increasingly visible towards the outer regions .",
    "the latter circumstance does nt necessarily imply that old stars are absent at the center ; it simply means that crowding is too severe there to let us resolve them . in the outer regions , where crowding is definitely not a problem ,",
    "the cmds present a well defined upper portion of the rgb , whose tip is also very well defined and allowed us to accurately derive the galaxy distance @xcite .    by applying to each region the synthetic cmd method , @xcite have inferred their sfhs , summarized in fig.[sf1705 ] , where the sfr per unit area is plotted as a function of age .",
    "it can be seen that , except for the innermost region , where crowding does not allow us to reach old lookback times , all the regions have been forming stars since at least 5 gyr . on average , the sf appears to have been rather continous : there are evidences for interruptions in the sf activity , but always shorter than a few myr or tens of myr , at least in the age range where we do have this time resolution ( i.e. in the last 1 gyr or so ) .",
    "quiescent phases of 100 myr or longer would have appeared as gaps in the empirical cmds of stars younger than 1 gyr , and such gaps are absent .",
    "the sf history of ngc1705 shows three striking features : one is the burst occurred in the central regions 1015 myr ago , when the central super star cluster also formed and when the observed galactic wind is supposed to have originated ; the second is the quiescent phase with no sf anywhere in the galaxy right after such burst , probably due to the gas sweeping by shocks and winds triggered by the explosions of the burst supernovae ; and the third is the new , even stronger , sf activity occurring everywhere in ngc1705 ( but much higher in the inner regions ) in the last 2 myr .",
    "the latter event puts interesting constraints on the cooling timescales of the gas heated by the supernovae generated in the previous burst and on the modeling of sf processes .",
    "fig.[sfall ] sketches the global sfhs derived by various authors for some of the late - type dwarfs studied so far .",
    "the lookback time is indicated and in all cases stars with that age were detected .",
    "the latter is one of the most interesting results of all the studies of bcds whose individual stars have been resolved by hst and the sfh has been derived with the synthetic cmd method : all of them have turned out to be already active at the lookback time reached by the photometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "none appears to be experiencing now its first star formation activity , including the most metal poor , gas rich ones , such as sbs1415 and izw18 ( see @xcite and aloisi , this volume ) .",
    "equally interesting is that the galaxy with stronger sf activity is the dirr ngc1569 , the only one with a rate comparable to the 1 @xmath2 required by @xcite to let a late - type galaxy contribute to the blue galaxy excess observed in counts at intermediate redshift .",
    "all the other dwarfs , independently of being classified as bcds or irregulars or low surface brightness ( lsb ) , present much lower sfrs .",
    "we also notice that all the galaxies of fig.[sfall ] , but the lmc , have similar global sfhs , with a recent burst overimposed on a quiter , more continuous regime .",
    "if we consider also the other late - type dwarfs in the local group studied so far , we can speculate that the only apparent difference in the sfh of bcds and dirrs is that the former always show a very recent sf burst , the latter not always .",
    "this is presumably due to selection effects that made it possible in the past to discover distant dwarfs only if featured with strong hii region emissions , whilst nearby dwarfs were discoverable also if the peak of their sf activity occurred long ago .",
    "the main results from all the studies performed on the sf histories of dwarf galaxies are : 1 ) no evidence of long interruptions in the sf activity has been found , except in early - type galaxies ; 2 ) no galaxy currently experiencing its first sf activity has been found yet ; 3 ) strong bursts do nt seem to be frequent ; 4 ) the sf regime seems to be a gasping rather than a bursting one in all late - type dwarfs , both in the local group and outside it ; 5 ) no significant difference has been found in the sfh and in the stellar populations of bcds and dirrs , except that the former always have a recent sf burst .",
    "these results have profound effects on our understanding of the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "in addition , the combination of hst photometry with high - performance spectroscopy is providing in the last years a first in - depth view of their chemical evolution .",
    "the detailed chemical abundances measured in many of their stars have solved the age - metallicity degeneracy affecting the rgb colours and have led to the derivation of age - metallicity relations not only in the lmc ( e.g. @xcite ) but also in other nearby dwarf spheroidals ( e.g. @xcite ) . as a consequence , for the first time",
    "detailed chemical evolution models can be computed for individual dwarf galaxies , an application performable until recently only for spirals , where the wealth and quality of the observational data were sufficient to properly constrain the models .",
    "the new generation models can now adopt sf laws and initial mass functions which are not free parameters , but are provided by the sfh studies , and their predictions can be compared with the chemical abundances not only of very young objects , but also of stars of various ages .",
    "such a decrease in the number of free parameters opens the route to a much more reliable use of theoretical models and , ultimately , to a much better understanding of galaxy evolution .",
