    "our present knowledge about elementary particles and their interactions upto the energy scale of several hundred gev s is encapsulated in the theory called the standard model(sm ) .",
    "the sm , a renormalizable gauge theory of strong and electroweak interactions based on the guage group @xmath3 , gives a successful explanation for most of the phenomena governing fundamental processes , and is in excellent agreement with the experimental data to date . however , there are a number of unanswered questions which motivates us to think beyond the sm .",
    "these include , just to name a few , the flavour and naturalness problems , the absence of a cold dark matter candidate in the spectrum , and the origin of neutrino masses and mixing@xcite .",
    "they have led to a plethora of conjectures extending the sm .",
    "+ on the experimental side , a golden opportunity to test many of these conjectures has come through the large hadron collider(lhc ) , which aims at not only discovering the only missing piece of the sm , namely the higgs boson , but also looking for new physics beyond it .",
    "+ one of the various ideas beyond the sm is to extend the fermionic sector of the sm by postulating existence of either a sequential fourth generation@xcite or vector - like fermions .",
    "the electroweak precision data strongly constrains the existence of extra chiral fermions .",
    "on the other hand , vector - like fermions , have left - and right - handed components with the same transformation property under su(2 ) , and are considerably free from the aforementioned constraints .",
    "they can have gauge invariant mass terms of the form @xmath4 , which do not arise from the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , and should be traced to some new physics scale .",
    "thus their signature is of immediate interest if that scale is accessible to the lhc , with the fond hope that they might contain some clue to the flavour problem . + vectorlike fermions appear as singlets , doublets or triplets under su(2 ) , in many options beyond the standard model(bsm ) like little higgs model@xcite , composite higgs model@xciteand extra dimensional models@xcite .",
    "they also appear in some grand unified theories like @xmath5@xcite , which once got impetus from considerations underlying superstring theories .",
    "in particular , vectorlike isosinglets also play a role in the @xmath6 effective lagrangian analysis studies@xcite .",
    "also , it has been pointed out that models with such an extended quark sector can give rise to quark electric dipole moment at the two - loop level due to the lack of glashow - illiopoulos - maiani(gim ) suppression , thereby implying constraints on the model parameter space(s)@xcite .",
    "the collider phenomenology of such an isosinglet vector fermion has been studied from various angles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ here we focus on an su(2 ) singlet , charge @xmath7 vectorlike quark .",
    "it should be noted that down - type vectorlike isosinglets , too , have been considered extensively in the literature@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the vectorlike quark is pair - produced at the lhc in the same way as the top quark , subject , of course , to the inevitable kinematical suppression if its mass is higher .",
    "such a quark , however , has additional decay channels , which can make it distinct .",
    "the main features responsible for such distinction are its isosinglet character , and its capacity to mix with the top , once @xmath8 is broken . as a result of doublet - singlet mixing in the left chiral sector",
    ", such a quark , named @xmath9   here , has flavor changing interactions both with the higgs boson(h ) and the z boson .",
    "we propose to utilise the resulting dacay channels , namely @xmath9@xmath10 and @xmath9@xmath11 tz .",
    "in particular , we find that the former channel leads to a rather unique and background free signature arising from a @xmath12 state .",
    "+ on account of mixing between the sm fermions and their su(2 ) singlet counterparts , many observables are expected to be different from the standard model predictions , specially in the sector involving third family .",
    "we assume a situation where higgs is discovered already and its mass is approximately known .",
    "we use such a higgs as an instrument to investigate the production and decay of exotic top - like quark into channels which hardly have standard model backgrounds .",
    "we consider two higgs masses , namely @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 gev . in order to maximize our signal rates ,",
    "we let the higgs decay in each case into the final state with maximum branching ratio , namely h @xmath15 . we show that , using the consequent 6b final states(including decays of the top quarks as well ) , one can construct signals with very little sm backgrounds .",
    "tagging five b s out of six in each case , with appropriate event selection criteria , proves to be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we demonstrate that such a signal can allow us to probe in a discriminating fashion a large part of the parameter space consisting of the @xmath9mass and its mixing with the t. the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 contains an outline of the scenario , statements on the signal looked for , a reminder of the constraints on various parameters , and a resume of the methodology adopted .",
    "the results are presented in section .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section 4 .",
    "as has been said already , we consider a minimal extension of the sm with the inclusion of a top - ike vector isosinglet , @xmath16 ( 3,1,@xmath17 ,  @xmath18 ( 3,1,@xmath17 to the matter content of the sm . the gauge boson and the higgs sector remains unchanged .",
    "@xmath9can be produced in pair via the strong interactions or singly via eletroweak processes .",
    "we concentrate here on the former channel , which at the parton level corresponds to gg @xmath11 @xmath9@xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath9@xmath19   essentially arising from the gluon coupling of the heavy quark : @xmath21 neglecting the small contribution from electroweak diagrams , the pair production cross section for an isosinglet fermion and a chiral fourth generation fermion is the same@xcite,@xcite.the production cross section depends only upon the mass of @xmath9and goes down with increase in the mass .",
    "+ once the @xmath22 symmetry is broken , the most substantial mixing of @xmath9can take place with the top , as there are rather stringent bounds on mixing with the first two generations@xcite .",
    "it must be remarked that there have been studies which considered the mixing with the lighter generations , which can affect , for example , the single production of vector like quarks through the electroweak channels@xcite . as a result of such mixing , the four charge @xmath7 quarks in the weak basis",
    "are related to the corresponding mass eigenstates by @xmath23 v is the standard model ckm matrix . in such a basis",
    "the mass matrix for the down type quarks is diagonal .",
    "the mass matrix(@xmath24)for the up type quarks is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is @xmath28 mass matrix of the sm particles , @xmath29 is @xmath30 , @xmath31 is @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the mass term for @xmath9 . @xmath34 and @xmath33 do not arise from the yukawa couplings .",
    "@xmath35 is diagonalized by the bi - unitary transformation  :  @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is parametrized analogously to u but in spite of right handed fermions being there in the yukawa couplings , the elements of @xmath37 do not appear as such .",
    "+ with the structure of the mixing matrix being what is shown in equation([eq : u1 ] ) , the standard model ckm matrix is no longer unitary , and instead forms a block in the unitary @xmath38 mixing matrix u. the v and w together form the @xmath39 charged current mixing matrix .",
    "the violation of ckm unitarity leads to a breakdown of the glashow - illiopolous - miami(gim ) mechanism , and leads to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 ) in the top sector @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath9decays to the sm fermions along with either the electroweak guage bosons ( @xmath42,z ) or higgs boson(h ) at the tree level .",
    "the charged current interaction ( @xmath9@xmath43 ) is given by @xmath44 on account of mixing with the top quark we have flavor changing neutral current interactions with z boson given by @xmath45 and the interaction of @xmath9with higgs boson and the flavor changing yukawa coupling is @xmath46 where @xmath47 in this comes to be @xmath48 .",
    "in addition to the above yukawa coupling there are terms proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 which arise on account of the fact that it is not possible to diagonalize the mass and yukawa matrices simultaneously . + following the simplified version of the mixing matrix used in @xcite , we describe all the interactions of @xmath9  by the following mixing matrix @xmath51 where its interactions with all quarks of the first two generations are neglected",
    ". we also neglect the interactions of the sm quarks across the generations .",
    "the elements of the mixing matrix are chosen with the motivation to have considerable flavor changing decay modes in addition to the charge changing decay modes .",
    "+ we concentrate on one of the decay process of @xmath9 , namely , @xmath52 . for the sake of our current work",
    "we assume that the higgs boson has already been discovered with approximately known mass .",
    "this particular decay channel has already been used as a tool to study the discovery potential of higgs@xcite but with a different final state . in @xcite though the final decay of h considered is also to @xmath53 but it is in context of `` little higgs model '' where there are extra gauge and higgs bosons along with @xmath9 .",
    "the further decay chain we consider is where both the tops decay to @xmath54 and both the higgs to @xmath53 .",
    "i.e @xmath55 the final state consists of 6b s and 2 w s , out of which we attempt to identify 5b s and predict the signal for 5b+x final state . as we show in this work",
    ", this turns out to be a rather clean signal with very low sm background .",
    "+ direct and indirect searches for the vector fermions put constraints on the mass and couplings of @xmath9and the mixing angle @xmath56 , between t and @xmath9 . among them , direct searches imply the following bounds :    * considering @xmath57 as the only possible decay chain , the lower limit on the mass of @xmath9is 358 gev at 95@xmath58 c.l . by the cdf collaboration@xcite at center of mass energy , @xmath0=1.96 tev",
    "* the do collaboration puts the lower limit in the channel of w+jets decay , at the 95% cl to be 258 gev@xcite at @xmath0=1.96 tev .",
    "* the latest study by atlas set the lower limit on the mass of @xmath9at @xmath59 404 gev at the 95% c.l .",
    "assuming 100% decay through b@xmath60 mode@xcite at the center of mass energy , @xmath0=7 tev .",
    "* assuming 100 @xmath58 branching fraction for the decay @xmath9@xmath11tz , @xmath9with any mass less than 475 gev is excluded at 95 @xmath58 confidence level by cms detector at the lhc@xcite at @xmath0=7 tev . *",
    "the @xmath61 ratio given by , @xmath62 , gives a strong constraint on the t-@xmath63 mixing angle , @xmath56 to be @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of our current work , we consider the lowest mass to be 350 gev , and make no specific assumption about branching ratios in the three decay channels .      for numerical calculations ,",
    "we have used calchep v2.5.6@xcite and a calchep- pythia interface program@xcite along with pythia-6.4.24@xcite .",
    "the production cross - section of the isosinglet quark pair and the decay of @xmath9 , @xmath19  is calculated using calchep . in order to do so , a new model with the new interactions based on the mixing matrix considered , was added to the existing list of calchep models .",

    "<S> we predict a clean signal at the large hadron collider ( @xmath0=14tev ) for a scenario where there is a top - like , charge @xmath1 vectorlike isosinglet fermion . </S>",
    "<S> such a quark , via mixing with the standard model top , can undergo decays via both flavour - changing z - boson coupling and flavour - changing yukawa interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the latter channel , and study the situation where , following its pair - production , the heavy quark pair gives rise to two tops and two higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the case where each higgs decays in the @xmath2 channel , there can be a rather distinct and background - free signal that can unveil the existence of the vectorlike isosinglet quark of this kind .    </S>",
