    "the giroux correspondence between open book decompositions and contact structures on 3manifolds has been a key tool in contact geometry and low dimensional topology for quite some time . in studying relations between open book decompositions and contact structures",
    "one frequently wants to know if the open book decomposition is in some sense `` minimal '' or at least  non - destabilizable \" .",
    "the main theme explored in this note is destabilizability of open book decompositions .",
    "the bindings of open book decompositions of @xmath0 are in fact fibered links .",
    "the construction and study of fibered links in @xmath0 has a long history , see for example @xcite .",
    "hedden @xcite proved ( baader and ishikawa @xcite later independently re - proved and baker , etnyre and van horn - morris generalized @xcite ) that a fibered link in @xmath0 supports the unique tight contact structure on @xmath0 if and only if it is quasipositive .",
    "also in @xcite , baader and ishikawa raised the following question : does there exist a quasipositive fiber surface , other than a disk , from which we can not de - plumb a hopf band ?",
    "in the terminology of this paper , that is : does there exist an open book decomposition that supports the standard tight contact structure on @xmath0 , other than the @xmath1 , that does not destabilize ?    in @xcite ,",
    "baker , etnyre , and van horn - morris and in @xcite , wand found examples of open book decompositions that support the standard tight contact structure on @xmath0 , have page genus @xmath2 , and can not be destabilized down to the trivial open book @xmath1 .",
    "thus there are non - destabilizable examples of genus 2 , or 1 .",
    "( we note the results in this paper imply that if their examples destabilized to a planar open book then they would destabilize to the trivial open book , thus their examples prove the existence of a genus 2 or 1 non - destabilizable open book . )    in this paper , we completely answer this question in the planar case .",
    "we first note the existence of non - destabilizable examples with 5 or more boundary components .",
    "[ thm1 ] for each integer @xmath3 , there is a planar open book decomposition @xmath4 which supports the tight contact structure on @xmath0 , has @xmath5 binding components , and can not be destabilized .    however ,",
    "if the binding number is small enough , then the planar open books can be destabilized .",
    "[ thm2 ] suppose @xmath6 is a planar open book decomposition which supports the standard tight contact structure on @xmath0 other than the @xmath1 , and has at most @xmath7 binding components , then @xmath6 can be destabilized .",
    "we leave the following question open .",
    "are there open book decompositions supporting the standard tight contact structure on @xmath0 with page genus @xmath8 that can not be desabilzied ?",
    "what about higher genus ?",
    "one of the main tools we use in proving the above theorems is the homologically essential arc complex and essential translation distance .",
    "the arc complex was introduced by harer in @xcite to study the mapping class group but was first used to study open books in saito and yamamoto s @xcite . here",
    "we introduce the homologically essential arc complex and show its efficacy in studying stabilization of open books .",
    "we hope these new tools will find more applications in contact geometry .",
    "one can define the arc complex of a surface with boundary whose vertices are , more or less , isotopy classes of properly embedded arcs and two vertices have an edge if they are represented by disjoint arcs , see subsection  [ ssec : arcc ] for precise definitions . there is also the homologically essential arc complex defined in the same way , but only using homologically essential arcs .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath9 of the surface acts on both these complexes and we define the translation distance @xmath10 and the essential translation distance @xmath11 to be the minimal distance @xmath9 moves vertices in the respective complexes . we make the following observations .",
    "[ dist1 ] let @xmath12 be an open book decomposition .",
    "then @xmath13 implies that @xmath14 has an @xmath15 summand .",
    "we note the examples from @xcite imply that the other implication is not true .",
    "[ dist2 ] an open book decomposition for a tight contact structure on any manifold without an @xmath15 summand destabilizes if and only if its essential translation distance is 1 .",
    "generalizing previous conjectures , now known to be false , we can ask the following question .",
    "is there some integer @xmath5 larger than 0 such that if an open book decomposition is right veering and its monodromy has essential translation distance greater than @xmath5 , then the supported contact structure is tight ? the heegaard - floer contact invariant is non - zero ?",
    "we end with one last question .",
    "is there a relation between fractional dehn twist coefficients of a monodromy map and its ( essential ) translation distance ?",

    "in this section we begin by recalling the definition of an open book decomposition , its associated contact structure and other relevant notions . in the following subsection",
    "we define the arc complex and the homologically essential arc complex , define a notion of distance in these complexes and in the last subsection give a simple way one can try to bound the distance",
    ".      recall that given a surface @xmath16 with boundary and a diffeomorphism @xmath17 that fixes the boundary , we can construct a 3manifold @xmath14 by collapsing each circle @xmath18/\\sim$ ] in the boundary of the mapping torus @xmath19/(x,1)\\sim(\\phi(x),0)\\ ] ] to a point .",
    "we call the image of @xmath20 a of the open book and the boundary of this surface is called the of the open book .",
    "the diffeomorphism @xmath9 is called the of the open book .",
    "if @xmath21 is a 3manifold diffeomorphic to @xmath14 then we say that @xmath6 is an for @xmath21 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    a of an open book decomposition @xmath6 of a manifold @xmath21 is the open book decomposition @xmath22 obtained as follows : let @xmath23 be @xmath16 with a 1handle attached and let @xmath24 be a curve in @xmath23 that ( transversely ) intersects the co - core of the new 1handle exactly once . set @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the right handed dehn twist along @xmath24 .",
    "the of @xmath12 is defined in the same way except one set @xmath27 .",
    "one may easily check that @xmath28 is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 for both the positive and negative stabilization .",
    "it is well known @xcite that to an open book decomposition of @xmath21 there is a naturally associated contact structure @xmath29 and we say that the open book @xmath6 this contact structure . moreover positive stabilization does not change the contact structure where as negative stabilization does .    in @xcite",
    "the notion of an open book decomposition being right veering was defined as a way of trying to better understand whether or not the associated contact structure was tight or overtwisted .",
    "we recall the definition here .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be two arcs properly embedded in an oriented surface @xmath16 such that they have a common endpoint @xmath32 .",
    "isotope the curves ( rel boundary ) so that they intersect minimally .",
    "we say that @xmath30 is of @xmath31 at @xmath32 if the tangent vector to @xmath30 at @xmath32 followed by the tangent vector of @xmath31 at @xmath32 forms an oriented basis for @xmath33 , we also say that @xmath31 is to the left of @xmath30 at @xmath32 .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath9 of @xmath16 that fixes the boundary is called if for every arc @xmath30 that is properly embedded in @xmath16 , the image of @xmath30 is either isotopic to @xmath30 or is to the right of @xmath30 at each endpoint .",
    "the fundamental observation of honda , kazez and mati in @xcite was that if @xmath34 is a tight contact structure then all of the open books that support it will be right veering .      given a surface @xmath16 with non - empty boundary .",
    "choose a distinguished point on each boundary component .",
    "we will consider properly embedded arcs with endpoints on a subset of these distinguished points .",
    "we call a properly embedded arc if it is not isotopic into the boundary of @xmath16",
    ".    _ important convention : _ when discussing embedded arcs we only require that they are imbedded on their interior . that is both the endpoints can be mapped to the same place .",
    "we define the of @xmath16 , denoted @xmath35 , to be the complex with vertices the isotopy classes of properly embedded essential arcs with endpoints at the chosen distinguished points on the boundary .",
    "there will be an edge between two _ distinct _ vertices if the interiors of the arcs are disjoint after they have been isotoped to intersect minimally .",
    "finally @xmath36 distinct vertices will bound a @xmath36-simplex if they can be isotoped to have disjoint interior .",
    "we note that this definition is essentially equivalent to harer s definition in @xcite , though he allows for marked points on the interior , and is similar to saito and yamamoto s definition in @xcite .",
    "we did not check if our definition is equivalent to saito and yamamoto s , but suspect that this is the case .",
    "we note that even though saito and yamamoto were also studying open book decompositions we think our definition that requires arcs to have fixed endpoints is more convenient with discussing various notions such as right veering that have become important in contact geometry .",
    "there is a natural subcomplex @xmath37 of @xmath35 who vertices consist of homologically essential arcs and the higher cells are defined as above .",
    "we call this the .",
    "we define a distance function on the 0-skeleton of @xmath35 @xmath38 by declaring each edge in @xmath39 to have unit length .",
    "in particular @xmath40,[\\gamma'])$ ] is @xmath36 if @xmath36 is the smallest integer for which there is a sequence of distinct vertices @xmath41 such that @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is connected to @xmath45 by an edge for each @xmath46 .",
    "it is useful to point out that while saito and yamamoto s definition of the arc complex is different from ours , it is clear that the vertices are in one - to - one correspondence and under this correspondence the distance function we just defined is the same as theirs .",
    "thus the notion of translation distance below is also the same as theirs .",
    "similarly we define a distance function on the 0-skeleton of @xmath37 @xmath47 as above",
    ".      computing distance can be very difficult , so in this subsection we indicate how to get bounds on certain distances . given a surface @xmath16 with more than one boundary component",
    "we say @xmath23 is obtained from it by if @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath16 by gluing a disk to one of its boundary components .",
    "[ lem : b1 ] let @xmath16 be a surface with more than one boundary component . if @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath16 by capping off a boundary component and the distance between @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath48 is greater than 1 then the distance in @xmath35 is also greater than 1 .",
    "the same statement holds in the homologically essential arc complex .",
    "given arcs @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath16 ( without endpoints on the capped off boundary component ) that have distance 1 or 0 as arcs in @xmath16 we see that distance 0 implies they are isotopic and hence they would be isotopic in @xmath23 too ( and hence distance 0 there ) .",
    "distance 1 implies they are not isotopic but have disjoint interiors which clearly implies they have distance 0 or 1 in @xmath23 .",
    "thus if the distance in @xmath23 is greater than 1 , then it must also be great than 1 in @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we will define the translation distance and essential translation distance of a surface diffeomorphism and show how the later relates to destabilization of open book decompositions .      given a diffeomorphism @xmath9 of a surface with boundary @xmath16 ( that fixes the boundary )",
    "we define the to be the minimal distance that @xmath9 moves a vertex in @xmath35 : @xmath49 this notion was originally defined in @xcite using a slightly different notion for the arc complex , but as commented in subsection  [ ssec : arcc ] the notion of distance , and hence translation distance , is the same .",
    "we similarly define the : @xmath50    we will see below that the essential translation distance has a closer connection to contact geometric properties and for that reason we restrict attention to it .",
    "we gave the definition of translation distance largely to tie this work with that of saito and yamamoto and to contrast it with essential translation distance .",
    "for now we observe in the next two lemmas one simple difference between the two different notions of translation distance , the first lemma is just lemma  [ dist1 ] from the introduction .",
    "[ lem : de0 ] let @xmath12 be an open book decomposition .",
    "then @xmath13 implies that @xmath14 has an @xmath15 summand .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 .",
    "in this case there is an essential arc @xmath30 in @xmath16 such that @xmath51 that is @xmath9 can be assumed to fix @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath30 is essential there is an embedded closed curve @xmath31 in @xmath16 that intersects @xmath30 exactly once and the intersection is transverse . notice that @xmath52 $ ] in @xmath14 is a 2sphere @xmath53 ( see subsection  [ ssec : obd ] to recall the definition of @xmath14 ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath31 as sitting on one of the pages of the open book and this gives a simple closed curve in @xmath14 that intersects @xmath53 exactly once .",
    "let @xmath54 be a neighborhood of @xmath55 in @xmath14 and @xmath56 be the closure of its complement .",
    "one can glue a closed 3ball to @xmath54 and @xmath56 to obtain closed 3manifolds @xmath21 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath58 and that @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath12 be an open book decomposition .",
    "then @xmath60 implies that either    1 .",
    "@xmath14 has an @xmath15 , 2 .",
    "@xmath14 can be written as a non - trivial connected sum of two manifolds , or 3 .",
    "@xmath16 can be written as the boundary sum of two surface @xmath61 , @xmath9 can be isotoped to preserve @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 is an open book for @xmath0 for @xmath65 or @xmath2 , where @xmath66 .",
    "the proof of this lemma is very similar to the proof of the previous lemma and is left to the reader .",
    "so we see from these two lemmas that the essential translation distance can tell us about the manifold @xmath14 whereas the translation distance can only tell us about the open book decomposition .",
    "the connection between the essential translation distance of diffeomorphism and destabilization of an open book decomposition is given in the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath12 be an open book decomposition that is right veering .",
    "if the 3manifold @xmath14 associated to the open book does not have an @xmath15 summand , then @xmath12 ( positively ) destabilizes if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "we note that the obvious analogous theorem for left veering monodromies and negative destabilization also holds .",
    "the proof is left to the reader . before proving this theorem",
    "we note that theorem  [ dist2 ] from the introduction is an obvious corollary .",
    "we first assume that @xmath12 destabilizes .",
    "thus there is an open book @xmath68 of which @xmath12 is a stabilization .",
    "more specifically @xmath16 is @xmath23 with a 1handle attached and @xmath69 for some @xmath24 that intersects the co - core of the attached 1handle once .",
    "let @xmath30 denote this co - core .",
    "now in the definition of the arc complex choose the marked points on the boundary to contain @xmath70 if @xmath70 is contained in two separate boundary components and to be one of the endpoints of @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "in the latter case isotope one of the endpoints of @xmath30 so that it is also at a marked point . one may easily check that @xmath71 . thus @xmath72",
    "if @xmath13 then @xmath14 would have an @xmath15 summand by lemma  [ lem : de0 ] and this is ruled out by the hypothesis of the theorem . thus @xmath73    now suppose that @xmath74 .",
    "then there is an arc @xmath30 such that @xmath71 .",
    "that is @xmath30 and @xmath75 have disjoint interiors .",
    "if @xmath30 has both its endpoints at the same point then we can clearly isotope @xmath30 ( moving one of its endpoints ) so that @xmath30 is properly embedded and has distinct endpoints ( recall our _ important convention _ above ) and @xmath30 and @xmath75 are still disjoint .",
    "now let @xmath24 be the simple closed curve in @xmath16 formed from @xmath76 by connecting their endpoints and isotoping so that the curve is in the interior of @xmath16 .",
    "notice that due to the right veeringness of @xmath9 it is clear that we can choose @xmath24 so that it intersects both @xmath30 and @xmath75 each exactly once .",
    "one may easily verify that @xmath77 fixes @xmath30 .",
    "thus we may form a surface @xmath23 by cutting along @xmath30 and @xmath78 will induce a diffeomorphism @xmath79 of @xmath23 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath12 is a stabilization of @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the proof actually shows that , under the hypothesis of the theorem , an arc is the co - core of a 1handled used to stabilize an open book if and only if the essential distance between it and its image under @xmath9 is 1 . the co - core of a stabilizing 1handle will be called a .",
    "in this section we will prove theorem  [ thm1 ] . to that end",
    "let @xmath80 be a compact planar surface with @xmath81-boundary components , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 be a diffeomorphism obtained as the composition of right handed dehn twists along the curves shown in figure  [ fig : sigman ] . since all other curves , except one , are disjoint , the conjugacy class of @xmath84 is independent of the order of the product .",
