    "for a general metric measure space we give sufficient conditions to assure that the group of isometries and the group of measure - preserving isometries are lie groups . as a particular case , spaces satisfying the _ riemannian curvature - dimension condition _ , @xmath0spaces , fulfill the conditions .    for certain classes of spaces",
    "it has been shown that the full group of isometries , @xmath2 , is a lie group .",
    "for example , myers and steenrod proved this fact for riemannian manifolds in @xcite , fukaya and yamaguchi for alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded by above and by below see @xcite and @xcite , and cheeger , colding , and naber in the case of ricci limit spaces in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are examples of metric spaces for which @xmath2 is not a lie group .",
    "assume that @xmath3 is a fully supported measure in the remaining of the text .",
    "the main result of this article is :    [ th:03 ] let @xmath4 be a locally compact , length metric measure space .",
    "assume    a.   @xmath5 has @xmath3-@xmath6 unique euclidean ( metric ) tangent cones , and that b.   for every @xmath7 with @xmath8 there exists a unique optimal dynamical plan @xmath9 and it is induced by a map",
    ".    then the group of measure - preserving isometries , @xmath10 , and the group of isometries , @xmath2 , are lie groups with respect to the compact - open topology .    by a theorem of van danzig and van der waerden @xcite and lemma [ cl:01 ]",
    "we can conclude that @xmath2 and @xmath10 are compact if @xmath5 is compact .",
    "the essential property of assumption @xmath11 in theorem [ th:03 ] is that the set of metric spaces that might appear as tangent cones is compact , and that the isometry groups of the tangent cones are lie groups with a uniform positive lower bound on the size of its subgroups .",
    "consequently we can relax hypothesis @xmath11 by only requiring such a behavior of the tangent cones @xmath3-almost everywhere .",
    "we remark that the hypothesis of a fully supported measure is a natural requirement for metric measure spaces .",
    "nonetheless , we can drop this hypothesis in the theorem by demanding instead a geodesically convex support and that assumption @xmath12 holds for arbitrary @xmath13 rather than just for absolutely continuous final measures . for a comment on the choice of topology on the groups see remark [ re:01 ] .    the so - called _ curvaturedimension conditions _",
    "generalize the notion of a lower ricci curvature bound to metric measure spaces .",
    "the use of optimal mass transport theory to state the conditions is characteristic to all of them .",
    "the conditions are crucial refinements made from an intintal condition introduced first independently by lott and villani and by sturm in @xcite , and in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the current shape of the curvature - dimension conditions is result of the works of various researchers .",
    "some important contributors are l. ambrosio , k. bacher , m. erbar , k. kuwada , n. gigli , a. mondino , t. rajala , g. savar , and k.t .",
    "sturm , for a historical recount one can consult for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we study spaces satisfying the _ riemannian curvature - dimension condition _ , the _ reduced curvature - dimension condition _ , and the _ measure contraction property_. we write for short @xmath14-condition , @xmath15-condition , and @xmath16 . among these conditions",
    "@xmath0-spaces reproduce behavior characteristic of riemannian manifolds better than the others , for instance see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two conditions allow spaces with finsleriann geometries @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 is the weakest condition among them all .",
    "the inclusion relation between these spaces can be written as @xmath17 riemannian manifolds with weighted volume measure and alexandrov spaces with the hausdorff measure are examples of spaces that satisfy the hypotheses of theorem [ th:03 ] .",
    "furthermore , due to works of mondino - naber@xcite , and of rajala - sturm @xcite it s known that @xmath0-spaces also meet the assumptions of the main theorem .",
    "[ th:01 ] let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 be an @xmath14-space .",
    "then the group @xmath10 is a lie group .",
    "[ th:02 ] let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 be an @xmath14-space .",
    "then the group @xmath2 is a lie group .",
    "examples of @xmath0-spaces are alexandrov and ricci limit spaces with the hausdorff measure , and generalized cone constructions over @xmath0-spaces ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not known whether the class of @xmath0-spaces is strictly bigger than that of ricci limit spaces .",
    "another class of examples of @xmath0-spaces comes from limits of weighted manifolds with a lower bound on the bakry - emery ricci tensor .",
    "hence the present work is a generalization of previous results .",
    "a question that arises is under which conditions the automorphism groups are lie groups for spaces satisfying different curvature - dimension conditions . as corollary of theorem [ th:03 ]",
    "we obtain that    [ co:02 ] the groups @xmath2 and @xmath10 are lie groups for essentially non - branching @xmath15-spaces and essentially non - branching @xmath1-spaces that have @xmath3-@xmath6 euclidean tangents .",
    "the corollary follows from the results of @xcite , and @xcite where the existence and uniqueness of optimal geodesic maps is proved on these classes of spaces .",
    "furthermore , we also show that the @xmath1-condition by itself is not enough to guarantee a lie group behavior of such groups .",
    "this is concluded from lemma [ lm : mcp ] .",
    "[ co:03 ] there exists an @xmath21 space for which neither @xmath10 nor @xmath2 are lie groups .",
    "corollaries [ th:02 ] , [ co:02 ] and [ co:03 ] are new in the literature .",
    "corollary [ th:01 ] is a new result as well and it was also proved by guijarro and santos - rodrguez in @xcite which appeared during the completion of this manuscript .",
    "we describe now the basic ideas of the proof of theorem [ th:03 ] .",
    "a remarkable result of gleason@xcite and yamabe@xcite in the early 1950 s asserts that a locally compact , topological group is not a lie group if and only if every neighborhood of the identity has a non - trivial subgroup . and the remarks below . ]",
    "if a group has this property we say that it has the small subgroup property , @xmath22 , for short .",
    "supposing that @xmath2 is not a lie group , by using a blow up argument , we show that the assumption of the @xmath3-@xmath6 infinitesimal euclideanity and the @xmath22 imply the existence of non - trivial isometries with large measure of the fixed point set .",
    "this is shown in proposition [ pr:01 ] .",
    "the existence of a single non - trivial isometry with a fixed point set of positive measure violates the assumption of the uniqueness of the optimal geodesic maps .",
    "this is in contradiction with the assumptions , thus we conclude that @xmath2 is a lie group .",
    "finally , calling into play the closed subgroup theorem we show that @xmath10 is a lie group .",
    "the use of blow - up arguments is common in the proofs done for alexandrov and ricci limit spaces .",
    "the delicate point is to guarantee a non - trivial convergence ( or a convergence at all ) of subgroups of isometries acting on the sequence of scaled spaces . in comparison to alexandrov spaces",
    "it is not known that in our spaces geodesics do not branch .",
    "whereas in the case of ricci limit spaces a crucial step in the works of cheeger - colding and of colding - naber depends on the connectedness properties of the regular set .",
    "these are difficult results to obtain and there s no reason to expect that they hold in the general setting of theorem [ th:03 ] .",
    "therefore we proceed in a different manner , giving a short argument that use optimal transport tools and measure properties of the regular set .    in the next section",
    "we summarize definitions and results that will be used . in section [ se : mms ] we find proposition [ pr:01 ] .",
    "the rest of the work needed to conclude the proof of theorem [ th:03 ] , and the proof itself is in section [ se : pr ] . in the end of the manuscript we present an example of an @xmath1-space where @xmath10 is not a lie group .",
    "the author would like to express his gratitude to jrgen jost for his crucial support and valuable advise and to rostislav matveev , and jim portegies for their significant involvement in this work .",
    "he thanks fernando galaz - garcia , martin kell , and tapio rajala for the observations and discussions that led to some of the remarks after theorem [ th:03 ] , as well as fabio cavalletti and andrea mondino for bringing @xcite to his attention .",
    "the author is thankful to nidhi kaihnsa and ruijun wu for commenting on earlier versions of the manuscript .",

    "we denote the set of all tangent cones of @xmath5 at @xmath37 by @xmath51 .",
    "the existence or uniqueness of tangent cones is not guaranteed in a general setting . however , the set of points of @xmath5 with unique euclidean tangent cones is called the @xmath52 @xmath53 of @xmath5 , written as @xmath54 . in detail",

    "therefore , a logical way to proceed is to couple a measure - wise and a metric - wise convergence .",
