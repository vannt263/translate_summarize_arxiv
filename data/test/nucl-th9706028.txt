    "the need for a relativistic methodology that is broadly applicable to nuclear physics has never been more apparent .",
    "one of our most important sets of problems involves understanding the transition between the ( baryon , meson ) and the ( quark , gluon ) degrees of freedom .",
    "using a relativistic formulation of the hadronic degrees of freedom is necessary to avoid a misinterpretation of a kinematic effect as a signal for the transition .",
    "the goal of understanding future high momentum studies of nuclear targets using exclusive , nearly exclusive or inclusive processes can only be met through using relativistic techniques .",
    "the light front approach of dirac@xcite in which the time variable is taken as @xmath0 and the spatial variables are @xmath1 @xcite is one of the promising approaches because the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is directly related to the observables .",
    "it is worthwhile to begin with a qualitative explanation of the utility of these light cone variables and this light front approach in a qualitative fashion .",

    "thus , a more direct relationship between the necessary nuclear theory and experiment occurs by using a theory in which @xmath6 is one of the canonical variables . since @xmath6 is conjugate to a spatial variable @xmath7 , it is natural to quantize the dynamical variables at the equal light cone time variable of @xmath8 . to use such",
    "a formalism is to use light front quantization , since the other three spatial coordinates ( @xmath9 ) are on a plane perpendicular to a light like vector@xcite .",
    "this use of light front quantization requires a new derivation of the nuclear wave function , because previous work used the equal time formalism .",
    "are these light cone variables useful only in nuclear deep inelastic scattering ?",
    "let s answer this by examining the origin of such coordinates .",
    "the four momentum of the incident virtual photon , q , can be said to have the components @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 very large but @xmath13 finite ( the bjorken limit ) .",
    "then @xmath14 the condition that the reaction be elastic scattering from the quarks is that @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "thus @xmath5 results from having only one large momentum in the problem , which can be taken in the negative z - direction , so that minus component is enhanced .",
    "more generally , one expects to be able to use light cone coordinates @xmath17 whenever there is such a large momentum in the problem as in any high energy scattering process .",
    "diverse applications are shown in the text by cheng and wu@xcite .",
    "examples of most relevance include high energy projectile nuclear scattering and high momentum transfer quasi - elastic reactions involving nuclear targets .",
    "light front techniques have previously been applied to systems of two hadrons .",
    "the two main approaches have been the relativistic quantum mechanics of directly interacting particles @xcite and relativistic field theory @xcite .",
    "we choose here to employ specific lagrangians which embody chiral and other symmetries , and thus use field theory .    the light front quantization procedure necessary to treat nucleon interactions with scalar and vector mesons was derived by soper@xcite , and by yan and collaborators@xcite .",
    "here we combine the previous formalisms to obtain a light front treatment of a lagrangian which contains pions , vector and scalar mesons , and which respects the constraints of chiral symmetry .",

    "the energy momentum tensor , the light front hamiltonian @xmath19 and plus momentum operator @xmath20 are derived .",
    "the necessary contact interactions involving the exchange of instantaneous fermions and vector bosons are obtained .",
    "the principal purpose of the present work is to develop a technique that could have wide application in nuclear physics .",
    "thus we study and check the present formalism by applying it to three different examples- @xmath21 and @xmath22 scattering , and a mean field treatment of infinite nuclear matter- of relevance to nuclear physics . dealing successfully with each of these subjects",
    "is a prerequisite for making progress .",
    "3 shows how light front field theory leads to a chiral treatment of low energy pion - nucleon scattering , which is consistent with the results of soft pion theorems .",

    "4 . a discussion of the impact of chiral symmetry on the two - nucleon intermediate state contribution to the two pion exchange potential",
    "is also included .",
    "the mean field approximation is applied to infinite nuclear matter in sect 5 .",
    "glazek and shakin@xcite used a lagrangian containing nucleons and scalar mesons to study infinite nuclear matter . here",
    "vector mesons are included and the rotational - invariance arguments used in sect . 4 are used to derive the glazek - shakin @xmath6 variable . the energy of nuclear matter is computed and shown to be the same as found in the equal time formalism . the unique feature of the present formalism is the ability to obtain the nuclear and mesonic plus - momentum distributions from the energy momentum tensor .",
    "we find that that mesons can carry a significant fraction of the nuclear plus momentum , but have support only at 0 plus - momentum .",
    "some the results for nuclear matter have been presented in an earlier publication@xcite ; here the calculation is performed in two different ways and explained in more detail .",

    "one then gets lagrangians of the non - linear representation , as explained by weinberg @xcite . in this case",
    "the early soft pion theorems are manifest in the lagrangian , and the linear pion - fermion coupling is of the pseudovector type .",
    "however , the use of light front theory , requires that one find an easy way to solve the constraint equation that governs the fermion field .",
    "we shall show that the constraint can be handled in a simple fashion by using the linear representation .",
    "moreover , we shall see that the early soft pion theorems are indeed manifest from the form of the light front hamiltonian .",
    "the constant @xmath39 plays the role of the bare pion - nucleon coupling constant . if @xmath40 is chosen to be the pion decay constant , the goldberger - trieman relation yields the result that the axial vector coupling constant @xmath41 , which would be a problem for the lagrangian , unless loop effects can make up the needed 25% effect .",

    "there are no explicit @xmath44 in the above lagrangian .",
    "those will be handled in a future publication . for the moment",
    "we note that treating the higher order effects of the pion - nucleon inherent in this lagrangian is likely to lead to a resonance in the ( 3,3 ) channel of pion nucleon scattering .",
    "such effects can be included in the two - pion exchange contribution to nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , such an approach seems cumbersome .",
    "the choice of using an explicit @xmath45 instead of the iterated @xmath46 interaction is analogous to our use of a scalar meson even though the effects of @xmath47 interactions , which could lead to similar effects , are included in the lagrangian .",

    "@xcite and subsequent papers .",
    "reproducing the observed values of @xmath249 and p - wave wave phase shifts requires a large value @xmath248 ; see ref .",

    "the potentials a , b , and c are defined by the parameters which account for the mesonic masses , coupling constants and form factors .",
    "thus we end up with the same procedure that is used in the bonn one boson exchange potentials .",
    "this brings us to the treatment of divergent terms in our procedure . the definition of any effective lagrangian requires the specification of such a procedure . for the present , it is sufficient to say that we introduce form factors , @xmath250 which reduce the strength of the @xmath228 meson - nucleon coupling for large values of @xmath251 .",

    "the nuclear binding effect is that the plus momentum of a bound nucleon is reduced by the binding energy , and so is that of its confined quarks .",

    "the mesons are shown to carry a significant fraction of the nuclear plus momentum , but only a zero plus - momentum ( a zero mode ) , and therefore do not participate in nuclear deep inelastic scattering or drell - yan experiments .    the ultimate validity of the above ( perhaps startling ) statement depends on whether or not the dominance of mesonic zero modes survives calculations performed for finite nuclei and calculations which include the effects of nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
