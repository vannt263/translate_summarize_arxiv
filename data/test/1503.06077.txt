    "rare decays stand among the most powerful probes of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , most new physics ( np ) scenarios suffer from severe constraints due to their potentially large contributions to flavor observables .",
    "this has motivated an intense experimental search , with special focus on observables which are strongly suppressed in the sm .    in 2013 ,",
    "the lhcb collaboration reported on the measurement of several observables in processes involving @xmath3 transitions .",
    "a significant tension with the sm was found in some cases .",
    "these include angular observables in @xmath4  @xcite , particularly large in case of the popular @xmath5 @xcite , as well as a decrease , with respect to the sm expectation , in several branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "these anomalies received immediate attention in the flavor community , and soon several independent global fits @xcite showed that the tension could be alleviated in the presence of new physics contributions .",
    "interestingly , in 2014 the lhcb collaboration also found an indication of lepton universality violation in the theoretically rather clean ratio  @xcite @xmath6 measured in the low dilepton invariant mass regime , which departs from the sm result @xmath7 by @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "again , this led to some excitement in the community , in particular after it was found that this hint is compatible with the previous anomalies in @xmath3 transitions : they can be explained by the same type of np contributions to muonic operators @xcite .",
    "so far , the discussion has focused on results obtained by lhcb with an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 fb@xmath10 .",
    "the latest chapter of this story is the recent announcement of the lhcb collaboration of new results using the full lhc run i dataset  @xcite , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath11 fb@xmath10 , which confirm the robustness of the lhcb data .",
    "indeed , the new results are compatible with those found with @xmath9 fb@xmath10 , and several theorists have used the new data to update their analyses . according to @xcite , the hypothesis of non - zero np contributions is preferred over the sm by @xmath12 , @xmath13 if the 2014 measurement of @xmath14 is included , whereas the analysis of @xcite finds a slightly larger statistical significance for np ( slightly larger than @xmath15 ) even in the absence of @xmath14 . in any case , assuming that hadronic effects @xcite are not behind these anomalies ( something impossible in case of @xmath14 ) , there is clear evidence of new physics in @xmath16 meson decays . for a complete review of the subject see @xcite and references therein .",
    "several approaches have been considered in order to explain the @xmath17 anomalies .",
    "some papers @xcite consider generic @xmath2 bosons with flavor violating couplings .",
    "these have been shown to provide a simple way to reconcile theory predictions with experimental data .",
    "there are also some works that were built to address the first anomalies but fail to address the lepton universality violating @xmath14 measurement , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of 331 scenarios or ref .",
    "@xcite , where 4-quark scalar interactions were considered .",
    "finally , a few recent models can also account for the lepton universality violating @xmath14 measurement .",
    "one finds three types of working models : models with scalar or vector leptoquarks ( or similarly , r - parity violating supersymmetry , where the squarks can play the role of the leptoquarks )  @xcite , composite higgs models  @xcite and models with a @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is generally considered the easiest approach , since the anomalies can be solved with new contributions to vectorial operators . however , to the best of our knowledge , the only ( complete ) models that have been put forward in order to account for these anomalies using a @xmath2 are : ( 1 ) the one introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and the two - higgs - doublet version in @xcite ) , which makes use of a @xmath18 gauge symmetry , and ( 2 ) the one proposed in the recent paper @xcite , which extends the horizontal gauge symmetry to the quark sector .",
    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is a well established evidence of new physics , supported by a plethora of astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "this motivates further extensions of the sm of particle physics that include valid dm candidates . in dm models ,",
    "the current planck @xmath19 limits for the dm relic density , @xmath20 @xcite , typically imply strong constraints on the mass and couplings of the dm candidate .",
    "this , combined with additional constraints ( such as those from flavor physics ) , sometimes leads to very predictive scenarios where the parameter space of the dm model shrinks to small regions compatible with all observations .",
    "we propose a simple model which captures the main ingredients required to explain the @xmath3 anomalies and , simultaneously , provides a dm candidate . in order to do so",
    ", we extend the sm with a dark sector charged under an additional @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry gives rise to a massive @xmath2 boson , which communicates the sm particles with the dark matter particle and solves the @xmath3 anomalies with contributions to the relevant flavor observables .",
    "the interplay between dm and flavor physics leads to a very constrained scenario .",
    "in particular , achieving the measured dm relic density while providing the required np contributions to @xmath16 meson decays turns out to be very restrictive on the model parameters .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we discuss some general aspects about the @xmath0 anomalies and introduce the basic language to be used throughout the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we define our model , show how it addresses the @xmath3 anomalies while providing a dm candidate and discuss extensions to generate non - zero neutrino masses .",
    "[ sec : dm ] is devoted to the dm phenomenology of our model and the @xmath2 portal responsible for its production in the early universe .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] is a review of the most relevant constraints in our model , to be considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , where we present our numerical results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results , discuss some related aspects and derive some general conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss some general aspects about the @xmath3 anomalies . for a complete review of the subject ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .      the effective hamiltonian for @xmath3 transitions is usually written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fermi constant , @xmath24 the electric charge and @xmath25 the ckm matrix . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the effective operators that contribute to @xmath3 transitions , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 their wilson coefficients .",
    "since the most important anomalies have been found in semileptonic @xmath16 meson decays , we will consider the following set of operators , @xmath30 here @xmath31   and @xmath32 , for muons . ] .",
    "it is also customary to split the wilson coefficients in two parts : the sm contributions and the np contributions . since the primed operators , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", do not receive significant sm contributions , this is usually applied only to the unprimed wilson coefficients , which can be written as @xmath35 the sm contributions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , have been computed by different groups . assuming that these are the only contributions to the wilson coefficients",
    ", several independent global fits have found a sizable tension with experimental data on @xmath3 transitions .",
    "this motivates the addition of np contributions .",
    "when this is done , the global fits are clearly improved . according to @xcite ( we will mainly consider the results of this global fit ) ,",
    "the best improvements are found in two cases :    * * scenario 1 : * np provides a negative contribution to @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , leading to a wilson coefficient @xmath40 significantly smaller than the one in the sm . *",
    "* scenario 2 : * np enters in the @xmath41 invariant direction @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .    in both cases ,",
    "the rest of operators involving muons are perfectly compatible with the sm expectations .",
    "similarly , no np is required for operators involving electrons or tau leptons .      once determined the type of contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "a np model has to induce , one can figure out the main ingredients of a simple working model .",
    "arguably , the simplest one contains the following elements :    * a massive @xmath2 boson , responsible for the vectorial operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 * the @xmath2 must have flavor violating couplings to quarks * the @xmath2 must couple differently to electrons and muons    this setup can be easily parameterized by the lagrangian @xcite @xmath48 in order to account for the anomalies , one requires @xmath49 and either ( 1 ) @xmath50 , or ( 2 ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 , depending on the scenario one wants to consider . the rest of the @xmath2 couplings to",
    "sm fermions can be set to zero . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model we are going to consider belongs to scenario ( 2 ) . in this case , the quark and lepton currents contributing to @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both left - handed and one finds at tree - level  @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fine structure constant .",
    "note that @xmath56 and the ckm elements appear in eq . in order to normalize the wilson coefficients as defined in eqs . and .",
    "+ we now introduce a complete renormalizable model with these properties .",
    "we extend the sm gauge group with a new dark @xmath57 factor , under which all the sm particles are assumed to be singlets .",
    "the only particles charged under the @xmath57 group are the following vector - like fermions , @xmath58 as well as the complex scalar fields @xmath59 where we denote the gauge charges under @xmath60 and the @xmath41 doublets can be decomposed as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    besides canonical kinetic terms",
    ", the new vector - like fermions have dirac mass terms , @xmath63 as well as yukawa couplings with the sm fermions @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath11 component vectors .",
    "the scalar potential takes the form @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the sm higgs doublet and latexmath:[$\\mathcal v_{\\text{sm } } = m_h^2    involving the @xmath57 charged scalars are @xmath70 and @xmath71 we will assume that the scalar potential is such that only the standard higgs boson and the @xmath72 field acquire non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath73 therefore , the @xmath72 field will be responsible for the spontaneous breaking of @xmath57 , giving a mass to the @xmath2 , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the @xmath57 gauge coupling , and inducing mixings between the vector - like fermions and their sm counterparts thanks to the yukawa interactions in eq . .",
    "furthermore , after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the resulting lagrangian contains a remnant @xmath76 symmetry , under which @xmath77 is odd and all the other fields are even .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 is a stable neutral scalar , and thus a potentially valid dm candidate .",
    "it is worth noting that the mechanism to stabilize the dm particle does not introduce additional ad - hoc symmetries , but simply makes use of the same @xmath57 symmetry that is required in order to give an explanation to the lhcb observations .",
    "this goal has been achieved by breaking the continuous @xmath57 symmetry to a remnant @xmath76 , something that can be easily accomplished with a proper choice of @xmath57 charges  @xcite .    before concluding this section",
    "we must comment on @xmath1 mixing .",
    "it is well known that nothing prevents @xmath1 factors from mixing . in the model under consideration , this would be given by the lagrangian term @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the usual field strength tensors for the @xmath80 groups .",
    "in the presence of a non - zero @xmath81 coupling , kinetic mixing between the @xmath57 and @xmath82 gauge bosons is induced . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the physical @xmath2 boson would couple to all particles that carry hypercharge , this is , to all the sm fermions .",
    "this would lead to phenomenological problems since couplings to the first generation are strongly constrained .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the tree - level @xmath81 coupling vanishes .",
    "this is easily justified in our model because this term is not induced via renormalization group running if it is zero at some high - energy scale ( where one may speculate about a ultraviolet completion ) .",
    "the reason is our choice of the @xmath57 charges  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we must keep the 1-loop induced @xmath81 coupling , generated in loops including heavy vector - like quarks and leptons , under control .",
    "we find @xmath83 therefore , @xmath84 would ensure small @xmath81 couplings , while allowing large @xmath75 . something required by dm constraints ( see sec . [",
    "sec : dm ] ) .       and",
    "@xmath47 in our model . ]",
    "this model solves the @xmath3 anomalies in a similar fashion as the one in ref .",
    "the @xmath2 couplings to the sm fermions are generated after their mixing with the corresponding vector - like quarks and leptons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] . neglecting @xmath85 and @xmath86 ,",
    "the resulting @xmath2 couplings are found to be @xmath87 in case @xmath88 , the @xmath2 coupling to a pair of sm quarks can be further approximated to @xmath89 .",

    "is a new scalar field with @xmath57 charge @xmath90 , necessary in order to make the operator gauge invariant . ]",
    "we can further extend the model to get non - zero masses for the sm neutrinos .",
    "this can be done trivially by adding new particles , singlets under @xmath57 , which mediate the standard mechanisms .",
    "for example , the addition of right - handed neutrino singlets , @xmath91 , allows for the usual type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "it is , however , more interesting to consider a mechanism that involves the @xmath57 sector of the model .",
    "this can be done by means of the effective operator @xmath92 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numass ] . here",
    "@xmath93 is a new scalar field with with @xmath57 charge @xmath94 , necessary in order to make the operator gauge invariant . an example model that can serve as ultraviolet completion of @xmath95",
    "is obtained with the addition of the scalar @xmath96 , together with a vector - like ( dirac ) fermion @xmath97 .",
    "this allows for the yukawa couplings @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which lead to @xmath100 after integrating out @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "although @xmath93 must get a non - zero vev in order to break lepton number and generate neutrino masses , we note that our choice @xmath94 guarantees that the remnant @xmath76 symmetry that stabilizes the dm particle @xmath77 is preserved .",
    "at high temperatures @xmath77 attains thermal equilibrium in the heat bath through its reactions with the different degrees of freedom to which it couples . at decoupling ,",
    "the dominant processes determining the dm yield are the following @xmath103 reactions : , @xmath104 plays a subdominant role . ]",
    "* @xmath105 ( higgs portal ) : processes enabled by the @xmath106 coupling . * @xmath107 , with @xmath101 standing for the sm and the new vector - like quarks and leptons ( @xmath2 portal ) : the former enabled by @xmath108 mixing and @xmath57 coupling , while the latter solely by @xmath75 .    for very heavy dm with @xmath109 , also @xmath110 can take place .",
    "depending on the relative size of these processes ( pure scalar and @xmath2-mediated ) one can then distinguish several scenarios . among them",
    "those solely involving @xmath2-mediated processes , are  arguably  expected to be dominant ( they are driven by a gauge coupling ) .",
    "interestingly enough , in that case a clear correlation with flavor physics must exist .",
    "note that these processes match those in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] if one trades one of the fermion pairs for @xmath111 . therefore , under the fairly reasonable assumption that the @xmath2-mediated processes play a dominant role , an interplay between flavor and dm physics is possible establishing .",
    "thus , in turn , further constraining the flavor - transition parameters through the restrictions imposed by the condition of generating the correct dm relic density ( see the useful ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although our results rely on micromegas @xcite , a simple analytical discussion is worth doing .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath107 processes can be estimated to be @xmath112 where the @xmath113 and @xmath114 is a kinematic function .",
    "depending on the relative size of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , one can distinguish two regimes . for @xmath118 ,",
    "dm annihilation processes involve dominantly sm quarks and leptons ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) . in that case , however , the corresponding cross sections are suppressed by chiral / vector - like mixing ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta - parameters ] ) ) , annihilation is rather inefficient and therefore leads to an overpopulation of @xmath77 scalars . for @xmath121",
    ", processes involving the vector - like fields are also possible , and since they are not suppressed by mixing parameters they can lead to the appropriate dm relic abundance .",
    "note that if the dm and vector - like fermion mass splitting is small , then the cross section will be phase space suppressed : @xmath122 . in this case",
    ", resonant annihilation is needed to efficiently deplete the scalar @xmath77 population ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : c9 dm ] ) . for large mass splittings , in contrast , annihilation is very efficient , and so the correct relic density can be readily obtained .",
    "however , reconciling this `` scenario '' with flavor constraints turns out to be tricky .",
    "avoiding the resonance requires @xmath123 , which means @xmath124 , and a large @xmath75 close to 1 . in that limit ,",
    "@xmath125 which for typical vector - like quark masses , @xmath126  tev , implies large chiral / vector - like quark mixing ( order one @xmath127 couplings ) in order to be compatible with the lhcb observations .",
    "this , however , is forbidden by quark flavor constraints ( see next section ) .    in summary , the correct dm relic density can be easily produced within our setup provided @xmath128 and dm annihilation proceeds resonantly .",
    "resonant annihilation can be avoided for @xmath129 , but finding spots in parameter space consistent with both , dm and flavor constraints seems challenging . the right relic density might as well be produced when @xmath118 , but probably this would require being sharply at the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "there are constraints on the mass of additional gauge bosons coupled to sm states .",
    "the ballpark of these limits is about 2.53.0  tev for @xmath1 extensions which predict a coupling of the @xmath130 to light quarks of @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "however , in our model these couplings are suppressed by the small mixing between the sm quarks and the vector - like states .",
    "thus , we nearly get any constraint on the mass of the @xmath130 from lhc searches .",
    "in addition , we are going to assume in the lepton sector only a sizable mixing for muons with the new states .",
    "therefore , we get also hardly any limit on @xmath132 from lep searches .    thus , we can safely assume in the following that the @xmath2 couplings to the first generation of sm fermions can be neglected and evade all lep and lhc limits .",
    "similarly , @xmath2 contributions to flavor observables related to the first generation can be safely neglected .",
    "let us now review several relevant constraints in our model .",
    "the masses of the vector - like quarks have strong bounds from the lhc .",
    "being colored particles , vector - like quarks can be efficiently produced in @xmath133 collisions , which typically pushes their masses towards the tev scale , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "since our setup works with vector - like quarks with masses at or above the tev scale , these bounds are easily satisfied .",
    "vector - like leptons can be searched for at the lhc in the standard multi - lepton channels . using the cms analysis in @xcite , based on searches for final states including @xmath11 or more leptons with an integrated luminosity of about @xmath134  fb@xmath10 at @xmath135  tev , ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a lower limit on the mass of doublet vector - like leptons of about @xmath136  gev , in case they decay to electrons or muons , and about @xmath137  gev , in case they decay to tau leptons .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite considered the analogous atlas multi - lepton search @xcite , with @xmath138  fb@xmath10 at @xmath135  tev , also looking for final states with @xmath11 or more leptons .",
    "the results were similar to the ones derived from the cms analysis , with lower limits on the mass of doublet vector - like leptons of about @xmath139  gev .",
    "finally , one can also derive limits from @xmath140 searches at the lhc .",
    "however , according to @xcite , these are rather mild , only relevant for @xmath2 masses below @xmath141  gev .",
    "contrary to the model in @xcite , where the muonic current contributing to the @xmath3 observables is purely vectorial ( @xmath142 ) , in our model the current is left - handed and thus contains an axial vector contribution as well ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this is relevant for the @xmath144 decay , especially sensitive to axial - vector currents .",
    "currently , there is a little tension between the sm prediction for the average time - integrated branching ratio , @xmath145 , and the cms and lhcb measurements .",
    "while the sm prediction is found to be @xmath146  @xcite , the combination of the cms and lhcb measurements leads to @xmath147  @xcite . in view of this little deficit",
    ", the new @xmath2 mediated contribution might be potentially welcome .",
    "the @xmath144 decay is known for its reach in probing new physics scenarios ( see for example the recent papers @xcite ) . in the sm , the amplitude is dominated by the axial vector leptonic current , and thus by the @xmath148 wilson coefficient ( @xmath149 ) . similarly , in the model under consideration , the main np contribution is given by a modification of @xmath148 .",
    "we note that vector contributions vanish for lepton flavor conserving channels .",
    "therefore , our prediction for the average time - integrated branching ratio is simply given by @xmath150 nevertheless , the large experimental error in @xmath145 precludes from obtaining useful bounds . using the sm and the experimental average time - integrated branching ratios given above",

    ", one finds that in our setup @xmath155 , which is slightly above the @xmath156 limit , and thus perfectly compatible with the experimental measurement of @xmath145 at the @xmath157 level .",
    "another relevant flavor constraint comes from @xmath158 mixing , induced at tree - level by @xmath2 exchange as soon as a non - zero @xmath159 coupling is considered .",
    "allowing for a @xmath160 deviation from the sm expectation in the mixing amplitude , @xmath161 , one finds  @xcite @xmath162      in principle , the mixings with the vector - like leptons can induce lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes of the type @xmath163 , mediated by the @xmath2 boson .",
    "however , one can suppress them with a proper parameter choice . since all",
    "@xmath3 anomalies can be simultaneously explained with ( only ) new contributions to @xmath32 , @xmath164 is required , but one can choose @xmath165 .",
    "this would eliminate the coupling of the @xmath2 boson to electrons and tau leptons , and thus all lfv processes mediated by the @xmath2 boson .",
    "this includes lfv in @xmath16 decays , recently suggested in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .    besides the anomalies in @xmath3 transitions",
    ", the lhc might have found additional hints for new physics .",
    "recently , the cms collaboration found a 2.4@xmath166 excess in the @xmath167 channel which translates into br@xmath168%  @xcite .",
    "for this result , the collaboration made use of the 2012 dataset taken at @xmath169  tev with an integrated luminosity of 19.7  fb@xmath10 .",
    "this large higgs lfv branching ratio can not be accommodated in our setup , since vector - like leptons are known to be unable to reach such lfv rates in higgs decays due to limits from the radiative @xmath170 decay  @xcite .",
    "however , as suggested in @xcite and recently confirmed in several works @xcite , a simple extension with a second higgs doublet suffices to explain the cms hint .",
    "finally , we comment on limits from the ( former ) non - observation of lepton universality volation .",
    "indeed , very strong bounds have been derived in many scenarios due to the non - observation of lepton universality violating effects in , for example , pion and kaon decays ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , these are absent in our model due to the suppression of the vector - like and first generation sm quark mixing .",
    "there are several precision measurements in the lepton sector which might be potentially sensitive to the @xmath2 interactions considered in this model .",
    "first of all , there is the so - called _ neutrino trident production _  @xcite .",
    "this is the production of a muon anti - muon pair by scattering of muon neutrinos in the coulomb field of a target nucleus .",
    "the cross - section gets additional contributions in the presence of a new @xmath2 boson that couples to the muons , and these can be used to constrain @xmath171 and @xmath132 .",
    "the impact of this bound on @xmath2 models designed to solve the @xmath3 transitions was studied in @xcite . using the ccrf measurement of the trident cross - section  @xcite",
    ", one can derive bounds on the mass of the @xmath2 boson and its coupling to muons . for scenarios with left - handed @xmath2 coupling to muons , one finds  @xcite @xmath172    finally , there are two other constraints related to precision measurements in leptonic observables : @xmath173 and the @xmath174 boson couplings to the muon ( which are modified at the 1-loop level due to the @xmath2 interactions ) . however , in @xcite these are found to be relatively mild . for this reason we will not consider them in our numerical analysis .",
    "for the numerical analysis we have implemented the model into the mathematica package sarah@xcite and generated fortran code to link this model to spheno@xcite .",
    "the big advantage of this setup is that we can cross - check our tree - level approximations with a full numerical calculation .",
    "moreover , based on the flavorkit interface @xcite , the generated sphenoversion does not only calculate the tree - level contributions to the wilson coefficients but also all 1-loop corrections .",
    "this way , we can see in what parameter range the tree - level approximation works well and where it breaks down .",
    "in general , one can expect loop effects to become important when the mixing between sm quarks and the vector - like states is sizable : this leads to significant changes in the sm - like box and penguin contributions to @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". this alone would not be necessarily a problem .",
    "however , the same mixing influences also loop contributions to the other wilson coefficients , in particular @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "these effects have to be small in order to satisfy the results of global fits to @xmath3 data . + as second step , we used the calchep @xcite output of sarahto implement the model in micromegas to calculate the relic density . interfacing the parameter values between sphenoand micromegas",

    "our main numerical results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : c9 dm ] and [ fig : c7c9 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c9 dm ] we show the dark matter relic density in the @xmath181 plane , together with the ratio @xmath179 .",
    "the other important parameters entering this calculation have been fixed to @xmath182 first of all , we see that with these parameters the model is perfectly compatible with the constraints discussed in section [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "furthermore , there is a region for moderately large @xmath183 where the dm constraint can be satisfied and @xmath184 holds . to reduce the relic density to @xmath185 one has to be rather close the the @xmath130 resonance around 2  tev . in the same figure",
    "we show also @xmath186 when using the tree - level approximation only . in the interesting region",
    "where the flavor anomalies can be explained , this approximation is working quite well . however , for decreasing @xmath75 one would expect smaller values for @xmath186 at tree - level , while we find a large increment .",
    "the reason is that for constant @xmath132 and smaller @xmath75 , @xmath187 is increasing , leading to a larger mixing in the quark sector with the vector - like states .",
    "thus , loop effects become important and quickly dominate the behavior .",
    "these effects are not only expected to show up in @xmath188 but also in the other wilson coefficients as stated above . to demonstrate this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : c7c9 ] the contours for @xmath189 and @xmath190 in the same plane .",
    "obviously , we find a similar enhancement for small @xmath75 for both coefficients .",
    "however , for the most interesting region where tree - level contributions to @xmath188 dominates and can explain the anomalies , the change in @xmath175 is very moderate : @xmath191 .",
    "we have presented a dm model that successfully addresses the anomalies in @xmath3 transitions recently found by the lhcb collaboration . in our setup , @xmath16 mesons decay through the @xmath2 into the dark sector , which mixes with the sm via yukawa couplings .",
    "an interesting connection between dm and flavor physics emerges , leading to a very constrained scenario where the np masses and parameters are restricted to lie in thin regions of the full parameter space .",
    "the model offers several interesting phenomenological possibilities . due to the mixing between the sm muons and the vector - like lepton doublet ,",
    "our model predicts a reduction of the @xmath192 coupling , @xmath193 , with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "the most direct probe of this coupling is , of course , the higgs boson decay into a pair of muons , @xmath194 , experimentally very challenging in a hadron collider due to the expected low branching ratio ( @xmath195 in the sm ) . in 2013 ,",
    "the atlas collaboration presented results based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath196 fb@xmath10 in collisions at @xmath135 tev , without any evidence of a signal  @xcite . for @xmath197 gev",
    ", they obtained an upper limit on the @xmath198 signal strength , @xmath199 ( at @xmath200 cl ) . assuming a sm - like higgs boson production",
    ", this limit translates into @xmath201 .",
    "obviously , our model is well within the limit , since it predicts a reduction of the coupling .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that a precise determination of this coupling in a future linear collider would be a strong test of the model   coupling with an uncertainty of about @xmath202 . ] .",
    "let us also comment on the mixings between the vector - like fermions and the sm ones .",
    "these are determined by free yukawa parameters which , in principle , are naturally expected to be of the same order for all sm generations . however , in order to avoid conflict with existing experimental data , one is forced to strongly suppress the mixings with the first generation , implying @xmath203 .",
    "this might seems like an ad - hoc assumption .",
    "however , it just reflects the _ constant _ need for a theory of flavor , also required to understand the yukawa structure of the sm  .",
    "finally , one can envisage several phenomenological directions in which this model can be further explored . by allowing for non - zero couplings to first generation quarks and leptons ,",
    "the impact of the model gets extended to many additional observables of interest .",
    "in particular , the lhc would be able to probe the parameter space of the model via the production of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "furthermore , since the scalar dm carries , at early times , a conserved @xmath57 charge it will develop an asymmetry , provided chemical equilibrium with the thermal bath is guaranteed .",
    "in such a case ( asymmetric dm scenario @xcite ) , a link between the baryon and dm asymmetries is something worth exploring .",
    "an update of the global fit @xcite was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "while this would change slightly the numerical output of our analysis , our conclusions would remain unchanged .",
    "we are grateful to javier virto and jorge martin camalich for enlightening discussions .",
    "das wants to thank diego restrepo and carlos yaguna for very useful conversations on dark matter .",
