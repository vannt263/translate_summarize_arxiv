    "the profile of the hydrogen emission line and the flat light curves can be understood in the context of type  iin supernovae as discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the data presented here show that the slow decay has continued @xmath20  days after maximum at a rate of @xmath21  mag / day , a rate that is significantly slower than the @xmath22  mag / day decay rate expected from co@xmath23 decay ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , our early - time points show that the light curve of sn  2002ic was consistent with a pure sn  ia early in its evolution .",
    "this implies that there was a significant time delay between the explosion and development of substantial radiation from the csm interaction , possibly due to a a physical gap between the progenitor explosion and the beginning of the csm .",

[ fig:2002ic_template ] ) . at early times , the inferred contribution of the csm is dependent on the stretch of the template chosen , but at later times the csm component completely dominates for any value of the stretch parameter .",
    "it is not possible to disentangle the contribution of the csm from that of the sn at maximum light , although a normal sn  ia at the redshift of sn  2002ic , @xmath26  @xcite , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath27 for an @xmath28  km / s / mpc  @xcite , would only generate about half of the flux observed for sn  2002ic at maximum .",

    "@xcite note a similar disagreement , but the data we present here show that this region is clearly a second bump rather than just a very slow decline .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by a change in the density of the circumstellar medium due to a change in the progenitor mass - loss evolution at that point .",

    "[ fig:2002ic_template_csm_fit ] ) .",
    "if the conversion of kinetic energy to luminosity is immediate and roughly constant in time , as assumed in our model , we would conclude that a low - density region must have existed between the star and out from the star .",
    "for example , as a stellar system transitions from an agb star to a proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) , it changes from emitting a denser , cooler wind , to a hotter , less dense wind  @xcite .",
    "this hot wind pushes the older wind out farther and creates a sharp density gradient and possible clumping near the interface between the cool and hot winds  @xcite .",
    "this overall structure is similar to that which we infer from our modeling of sn  2002ic . assuming a sn ejecta speed of @xmath74  km  s@xmath5 and a progenitor star hot wind speed of @xmath75  km  s@xmath5  @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the hot wind must have begun just @xmath76  years prior to the sn explosion . alternatively , there is also the possibility that the conversion from kinetic energy to optical luminosity is for some reason significantly less efficient at very early times .",

    "spectroscopic study @xcite shows the highest observed velocity of the ejecta to be around @xmath78  km  s@xmath5 at day  @xmath79 after maximum light . if we assume a constant expansion rate , these observations of continuing emission through @xmath20  days after maximum provide a lower limit of @xmath80  cm for the spatial extent of the csm .",
    "compared to a nominal pre - explosion stellar wind speed of @xmath81  km  s@xmath5 , the ejecta is moving @xmath82 times more rapidly and thus has overtaken the progenitor wind from the past @xmath83  years .",
    "the overall smoothness of the late - time light curve shows the radial density profile of the csm to be similarly smooth and thus implies a fairly uniform mass - loss rate between @xmath84@xmath85 years prior to the sn explosion .",
    "we take the lack of enhanced flux at early times and the bump after maximum light as evidence for a gap between the sn progenitor and the dense csm as well as a significant further change in the mass - loss of the progenitor system @xmath86  years prior to the sn explosion .",

    "the discovery of dense csm surrounding a type  ia supernova strongly favors the binary nature of type  ia progenitor systems to explain the simultaneous presence of at least one degenerate object and substantial material presumably ejected by a significant stellar wind .",
    "however , it is as yet unclear whether the available data for sn  2002ic can prove or disprove either the single- or the double - degenerate scenario , although the inferred resemblance to ppn systems is suggestive .",
    "the early - time light curve data presented in this paper strongly suggest the existence of a @xmath2  year gap between the exploding object and the surrounding csm .",
    "our discovery and early- through late - time photometric followup of sn  2002ic suggests a reinterpretation of some type  iin events as type  ia thermonuclear explosions shrouded by a substantial layer of circumstellar material .",

    "<S> we present new pre - maximum and late - time optical photometry of the type  ia / iin supernova 2002ic . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are combined with the published v - band magnitudes of  @xcite and the vlt spectrophotometry of  @xcite to construct the most extensive light curve to date of this unusual supernova . </S>",
    "<S> the observed flux at late time is significantly higher relative to the flux at maximum than that of any other observed type  ia supernova and continues to fade very slowly a year after explosion . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the light curve suggests that a non - type ia supernova component becomes prominent @xmath0  days after explosion . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of the non - type ia supernova component as heating from the shock interaction of the supernova ejecta with pre - existing circumstellar material suggests the presence of a @xmath1  cm gap or trough between the progenitor system and the surrounding circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> this gap could be due to significantly lower mass - loss @xmath2  years prior to explosion or evacuation of the circumstellar material by a low - density fast wind . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is consistent with observed properties of proto - planetary nebulae and with models of white - dwarf + asymptotic giant branch star progenitor systems with the asymptotic giant branch star in the proto - planetary nebula phase . </S>"
