    "graphene , a two - dimensional allotrope of carbon , has created a immense interest in the condensed matter community and in the media since its isolation in 2004 @xcite . on the one hand , graphene has unique properties that derive from its honeycomb - like lattice structure such as the dirac - like spectrum ( that mimics effects of matter under extreme conditions ) , its low dimensionality ( that leads to enhanced quantum and thermal fluctuations ) , and its membrane - like nature ( that mixes aspects of soft and hard condensed matter ) . on the other hand , because of the strength and specificity of its covalent bonds , graphene is one of the strongest materials in nature ( albeit one of the softest ) , with literally none extrinsic substitutional impurities , leading to the highest electronic mobilities among metals and semiconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , graphene is being considered for a plethora of applications that range from conducting paints , and flexible displays , to high speed electronics .",
    "in fact , it can be said that perhaps , not since the invention of the transistor out of germanium in the 1950 s , a material has had this kind of impact in the solid state literature .",
    "however , unlike ordinary semiconductors such as germanium , gallium - arsenide , and silicon , graphene s unusual properties have to be understood before it can really have an impact in technological applications .",
    "any material has a hierarchy of energy scales that range from the atomic physics ( @xmath2 ev ) , to many - body effects ( @xmath3 ev ) . to understand the behavior of a material one needs to understand how these different energy scales affect its macroscopic properties . while structural properties such as strength against strain , shear and bending may depend on the covalent bonds formed by the atoms , magnetism and superconductivity",
    "are governed by the particular way electrons interact with each other through coulomb forces . furthermore , while the properties of metals and semiconductors depend on the physics close to the fermi energy ( a direct consequence of pauli s exclusion principle ) , the nature of the vibrational spectrum depends on the particular way ions interact among themselves and how the electrons screen these interactions",
    ".    one of the great accomplishments of the application of quantum mechanics to the theory of metals is the understanding that while different materials can be structurally very different from each other , its long wavelength and low energy physics is essentially identical and depend on very few parameters .",
    "this so - called renormalization towards the fermi energy @xcite is one of the greatest theoretical accomplishments of the twentieth century and is the basis of landau s theory of the fermi liquid @xcite . in systems where the low energy physics is described by a transformation of coordinates with _",
    "galilean invariance _",
    "the most significant parameter is the `` effective '' mass of the carriers that acts as to generate a _ scale _ from which is possible to compute most of the important physical quantities such as specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , electronic compressibility , and so on .",
    "the most basic difference between graphene and other materials is that its low energy physics is not galilean invariant , but instead _ lorentz invariant _ , just like systems in particle and high - energy physics with dirac particles as elementary excitations @xcite . in this case",
    ", the renormalization towards the fermi energy is different from other materials @xcite because , in the absence of a `` mass '' ( which in graphene means the absence of a gap in the electronic spectrum ) , all physical quantities depend on a characteristic `` effective '' velocity that plays an analogous role as the speed of light plays in relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , unlike true relativistic fermionic systems @xcite , the dirac quasiparticles in graphene still propagate with a velocity that is much smaller than the speed of light , the speed that coulomb interactions propagate .",
    "therefore , the coulomb field can be considered instantaneous in first approximation , making of the electrodynamics of graphene electrons a mix between a relativistic and a non - relativist problem .",
    "clearly this unusual situation requires a re - evaluation of the fermi liquid theory for this material .    in these notes , however , we are going to focus on the more basic aspects of graphene s properties . in section [ chemistry ] we are going to discuss the @xmath4 hybridization theory and how it leads to the basic energy scales of the graphene problem .",
    "we are going to show that the problem of hybridization is controlled by the angle between the @xmath4 hybridized orbitals . using the slater - koster theory , we compute the main matrix elements of the problems in terms of this angle . in section [ bands ]",
    "we move from molecular orbitals to the crystal and discuss the simplest tight binding hamiltonian that describes the _ full _ band structure , that is , that includes both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "we show that even this simple band - structure reproduces quite well the results of more sophisticated _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "this particular description becomes particularly good close to the fermi energy where the dirac particles emerge naturally .",
    "phonons in free floating graphene are discussed in section [ phonons ] .",
    "we show how the flexural modes result from the bending energy of a soft membrane and how those modes can be quantized .",
    "we show that as a result of the presence of flexural modes the linear phonon theory predicts an instability of the graphene sheet towards crumpling .",
    "the effect of a substrate on the flexural mode spectrum is discussed in section [ constraint ] .",
    "we show that the presence of a substrate , that breaks rotational and translational symmetry , allows for new terms in the phonon hamiltonian that change considerably the energy dispersion of the flexural modes .",
    "we also show that within the linear theory , graphene follows the substrate in a smooth way with the characteristic length scales that are dependent on the details of the interaction with the substrate .",
    "when graphene is deformed in some way , either by bending or strain , the electronic motion is affected directly . in section [ deformed ]",
    "we show that at long wavelengths deformations lead to new terms in the dirac equation that couple to the electrons as vector and scalar potentials .",
    "there are cases , however , where graphene is not slightly deformed but strongly deformed in which case the dirac theory has to be completely reconsidered . in these notes",
    "we discuss briefly the case of a graphene scroll which results from the competition between the bending energy ( that favors flat graphene ) and the van der waals interaction of graphene with itself ( that wants it to have maximum area overlap ) .",
    "this is only one example where structural deformations can have a strong effect on many of the electronic properties of this material .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",

    "however , carbon forms @xmath4 hybridized orbitals .",

    "these results are modified by non - linear effects that we do not consider here @xcite .",
    "more important than those , is the fact that in most graphene experiments , where the measurement of electric properties depends of physically constraining the samples , the basic symmetries of free floating graphene are explicitly broken .",
    "this is what we consider in the next section .",
    "since graphene is not floating in free space and since there can be impurities that hybridize with the carbon atoms changing the structural properties , it is important to consider symmetry breaking process that change the picture presented in the last section .",

    "notice that this is the case of a 3d solid , that is , the flexural mode becomes an ordinary acoustic phonon mode .",
    "this is what happens in graphite where the interaction between layers breaks the rotational symmetry of the graphene layers .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case the graphene fluctuations become suppressed : at low temperatures we find @xmath162 is constant while @xmath163 is log divergent .",

    "let us consider the case of in - plane distortions . in this case , the only change in the hopping energy is due to the change in the distance between the @xmath220 orbitals .",
    "consider the case where the distance between sublattices changes by a distance @xmath221 in the direction of @xmath200 , in first order we have : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the lattice displacement .",
    "replacing the above expression in ( [ gaugefield ] ) we get : @xmath224 where @xmath42 is a constant with dimensions of energy and we have used the standard definition of the strain tensor : @xmath225 an analogous calculation for the change in the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping energy leads to : @xmath226 equations ( [ gaugein ] ) and ( [ potin ] ) relate the strain tensor to potentials that couple directly to the dirac particles .",

    "the main conclusion is therefore that for smooth distortions of graphene due to strain or bending the dirac particles are subject to scalar and vector potentials leading to an `` electrodynamics '' that is purely geometrical ( there is no electric charge associated with the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields created by structural deformations ) .",
    "this structural `` electrodynamics '' has strong consequences for the electronic motion in graphene leading to many unusual effects that can not be found in ordinary materials .",
    "in particular , one can manipulate the electrons by `` constructing '' appropriate deformations of the lattice that mimic electric and magnetic fields .",

    "the scroll is an example of the softness of graphene that shows up as an interplay between the van der waals energy , @xmath237 , that makes graphene stick to itself and the bending energy , @xmath238 , the energy cost to introduce curvature in the graphene sheet .",
    "let us show first that the scroll is a stable configuration of a free standing graphene sheet .",
    "we assume here that when graphene forms a scroll the equilibrium distance between folded regions is the same that one would find between the planes in graphite , that is , @xmath239 nm . in this case",
    ", the scroll is described by the so - called archemedian spiral : @xmath240 where @xmath241 .",

    "\\label{ebendteta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angle @xmath248 is determined by the condition that the force on the graphene sheet vanishes at the edge of the scroll : @xmath249 and using the values of the parameters we find @xmath250 .",
    "the total energy as a function of @xmath251 is given by ( [ vdwteta ] ) and ( [ ebendteta ] ) and shown in fig.[scrollene ] .",
    "notice that the scroll becomes stable for angles of rotation bigger than @xmath252 which is equivalent to approximately @xmath253 turns of the scroll .",
    "this result is in agreement with more involved calculations @xcite .",
    "consider what happens when a _ uniform _ magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "notice that in the region of the scroll the component of the field perpendicular to the graphene surface is changing periodically .",

    "[ scrollmag ] .",
    "notice that from the point of view of the electrons , which are constrained to live in a two dimensional universe , a uniform magnetic field in three dimensions , becomes an oscillating magnetic field in the presence of the scroll .",
    "an oscillating magnetic field has unusual effects on the electronic motion because the lorentz force changes sign in the region where the field changes sign producing a `` snake - like '' motion around the regions of zero field .",
    "these _ snake states _ are chiral one - dimensional correlated systems with rather unusual properties @xcite .",
    "while it is very hard to produce a magnetic field that oscillates in a short length scale , it is very hard to roll graphene on a short length scale .",
    "therefore , snake states should be easy to observe in rolled graphene sheets .",
    "graphene is a unusual system that shares properties of soft and hard matter and mimics problems in particle physics .",
    "these properties have their origin on the nature of its chemical bonds , the @xmath4 hybridization , and the low dimensionality .",
    "all these ingredients create a new framework for theoretical exploration which is still very much in its beginning .",
    "the possibility of studying electronics of deformed surfaces is quite intriguing because of its exotic `` electrodynamics '' .",
    "the field of electronic membranes was born out of the discovery of graphene in 2004 and much has still to be understood .    in these notes",
    "i covered some very basic aspects of graphene chemistry and physics .",
    "we have studied the basic hamiltonian that describes the overall band structure of graphene .",
    "we have seen that flexural modes , nonexistent in three dimensional solids , are fundamental for the understanding of the structural stability of the material .",
    "we have seen that substrates can change considerably the flexural modes and hence control the height fluctuations in supported samples .",
    "finally , we have studied the various ways that graphene deformations , either by strain or bending , can modify the electron propagation in this material",
    ". in particular , new structures that can be created out of flat graphene , such as the graphene scroll , can have exotic properties , such as snake states , in the presence of applied uniform magnetic fields . in some way ,",
    "the present notes complete some of the material already published in ref . .",
    "nevertheless , the whole subject of graphene electronics and structure is much bigger than that and there is so much more to be understood .",
    "it is quite obvious that a material that is structurally robust , still flexible , and extremely clean , has enormous potential for technological applications . by understanding these unusual properties",
    "one can harvest new functionalities that did not exist before .",
    "progress in material science unavoidably leads to progress .",
