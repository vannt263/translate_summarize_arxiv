    "the analysis of cosmic large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies contributed significantly to establish the current cosmological concordance model . with the increasing degree of perfection of the standard two - point correlation analysis , the related measurements reached unprecedented precision    .",
    "however , the available and upcoming galaxy redshift survey data @xcite can not merely be characterized by its two - point correlation properties .",
    "already the filamentary structure that we see in those surveys indicates that the higher - order correlations play an important role .",
    "there have been different approaches to use this information for improving our knowledge about the constituents and evolution of the universe .",
    "the most direct approach of course is to simply measure the higher - order correlations directly .",
    "this has been done for both simulated and observed data starting for early catalogs with @xcite and @xcite . especially measurements of the three - point function have been standard for recent surveys @xcite and provide useful complimentary information @xcite . for higher orders , however , there are computational and conceptual challenges . on the computational side ,",
    "increasing the order of the correlation function measured unleashes the curse of combinatorics .",
    "measuring all pairs in current surveys is feasible , for all triangles there are methods to do it @xcite , but beyond that it becomes increasingly hard .",
    "and then , from the conceptual side , even if measuring the full @xmath7-point function was possible , it would require modeling and covariances for a large number of data bins . already for a modest number of bins    for each parameter of the @xmath7-point function",
    "this is a challenge .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to consider other approaches that contain information on certain aspects of the higher - order clustering without referring to the full correlation functions .    since the beginning of large - scale structure analysis ,",
    "a large number of such methods have been used , including moments of counts in cells , void probability @xcite , structure functions on minimal spanning trees , wavelet methods , the genus , etc .",
    "recently also approaches that attempt to bring the higher - order information back into the two - point correlation function through non - linear transforms were used like    a logarithmic transformation @xcite .",
    "the method ( re-)considered in this paper is using minkowski functionals    .",
    "they also also fall into the category of methods that provide condensed access to higher - order information .",
    "this information is encoded in the morphology of the density field .",
    "minkowski functionals access it by quantifying extended regions of the field through their geometrical properties like volume and surface ( see sec .  [ sub : minkowski - functionals ] ) . for the construction of these extended regions ,",
    "two different methods have been widely used in the past :    in the first application of minkowski functionals for analyzing large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution in ( see @xcite for a short motivation and @xcite for a brief overview ) , the regions considered were defined by the union of balls around every galaxy location .",
    "we shall use the same method , referred to as germ - grain model , here and explain the details in sec .",
    "[ sub : germ  grain ] .",
    "after a couple of applications in the analysis of galaxy and cluster catalogs , the germ - grain model has been less used in recent years .",
    "the second and most popular form of the application of minkowski functionals works with extended regions that are defined by iso - contours of the field under investigation .",
    "it has been used for the higher - order contributions to the dark matter overdensity field @xcite , for the weak lensing shear field @xcite , for local morphology of cosmic structure and for the morphology of reionization bubbles @xcite .",
    "another very active field of recent application is the study of iso - temperature contour maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , where minkowski functionals helped to establish stringent bounds on the non - gaussianity of the cmb .",
    "so the iso - contour minkowski functionals are a well established tool in various domains of cosmology .",
    "however , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ sub : germ  grain ] , the germ - grain model accesses different aspects of the higher - order distribution and can be better suited for the analysis of galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "we have demonstrated some of these advantages already in the analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release seven ( dr7 ) luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate more explicitly on the higher - order aspects of the minkowski functionals . to this end",
    ", we exploit the analytically known connection to the integrals over higher - order correlation functions . using direct measurements of the two - point correlation function",
    ", we can isolate the contribution of higher - order correlation functions to the minkowski functionals .",
    "this allows us to quantify the evidence for non - gaussianity of the galaxy distribution ( see @xcite and @xcite for related recent studies of non - gaussianity with isodensity contour functionals ) .",
    "the analysis is demonstrated with the final data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) @xcite that is now publicly available within the dr12 of sdss - iii .",
    "being the largest spectroscopic galaxy redshift data set yet observed , it provides an ideal testbed for the analysis and reveals the strong presence of higher - order correlations already at redshifts of @xmath8 .",
    "we proceed as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : minkowski - functionals - in - the ] recalls the properties of minkowski functionals in general and the germ - grain model in particular .",
    "we write out the connection of the functionals to higher - order correlations explicitly in [ sub : densdef ] and lay out in [ sub : density - dependence ] , how knowing the concrete form allows us to isolate the part of the functionals that is only dependent on higher - orders .",
    "we explain the subtleties of a gaussian reference model in the discrete case in [ sub : gauss - poisson ] and recall the basic properties of our minkowski code in [ sub : samplingcode ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we turn to the description of the sdss dr12 data used .",

    "] we finally discuss the effect of the regions that can not be accounted for by our custom mask .    sec .",
    "[ sec : higherorders ] then turns to the core of the analysis . in [ sub : mfdensities ] we present the minkowski functionals of the mocks and the data and explain how we transform the data to be able to isolate the higher - order only part .",
    "this part is then examined in [ sub : highsubtract ] . in [ sub : seriescoefficients ] we demonstrate that the contributions to this higher - order part range at least up to the @xmath9-point function . to wrap up we discuss in [ sub : voidfraction ] an interesting aspects about the galaxy distribution using the base minkowski functional to study the volume in extreme voids in the observed field .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we shall provide the basic notions necessary for understanding the quantities we used in our analysis .",
    "we summarize some key points already covered in the dr7 analysis paper @xcite , but with an emphasis on the crucial points that are the source for common misconceptions .",
    "minkowski functionals ( often called mfs later on ) quantify the morphology of extended bodies .",
    "they are defined as scalar functionals that map the shape of a body to a set of real numbers .",
    "a quite surprising result of integral geometry @xcite is that any such scalar functional , defined for bodies in euclidean @xmath10-dimensional space , that fulfills some basic requirements ( motion invariance , additivity and conditional continuity ) can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath11 base functionals .",
    "there are different choices for the normalization of the base functionals .",
    "we will use one where the four mfs that exist for @xmath12 are denoted @xmath13 and related to geometrical properties of the body as follows : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the volume of the body , @xmath16 is its surface area , @xmath17 the integral mean curvature of the surface , and @xmath18 the euler characteristic ( the integral gaussian curvature of the surface ) .    instead of using the functionals @xmath19 directly , we will mainly work with the mf densities @xmath20 : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the volume within the survey boundary . in the practical calculation of the @xmath20 discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : samplingcode ] , @xmath22 is the volume of the region that is more than two ball radii away from our custom angular mask of fig .",
    "[ fig : custommask ] .",
    "as mentioned , mfs are only defined for extended bodies . for the analysis of large - scale structure , however , the galaxies are usually treated as points . for points ,",
    "all quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minkrelgeo ] ) are , a priori , trivial . for a meaningful analysis of large - scale structure ,",
    "one therefore has to smooth the point distribution in some manner to define extended regions .",
    "the two most popular choices for defining extended regions are :    1 .",
    "isodensity contours 2 .   the germ - grain model    the first approach attempts to reconstruct the underlying density field from the observed galaxies and to define the extended bodies as the interior of the surfaces of constant density .",
    "the value of this density threshold can then be varied and the functionals are studied as a function of this parameter .    in the second approach ,",
    "the extended bodies are constructed by surrounding every galaxy ( the germ ) by an extended body ( the grain ) , which in our case is a ball of a certain radius , and calculating the functionals for the union of all these balls .",
    "the diagnostic parameter in this case is the common radius of the balls .",
    "[ fig : boolean ] shows how a structured body emerges with increasing radius .",
    "are surrounded by balls of a common radius @xmath23 .",
    "then the mfs of the body formed by the union of all the balls are studied as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the parts of the body outside of the survey region are not taken into account . with increasing @xmath23 , more and more balls intersect and",
    "a complex structure develops . through the single and multiple intersections of neighboring balls , it encodes information about the @xmath7-point correlation hierarchy .",
    "plot from @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    only those parts of the structure are taken into account that lie within the survey boundaries , in fig .",
    "[ fig : boolean ] illustrated as a cube .",
    "even though the basic analysis tool is the same in both cases , the properties of the two approaches are quite different .",
    "the isodensity contours , at least in theory , are more directly linked the underlying physical density field , whereas the germ - grain radii are purely diagnostic parameters that merely specify the scale at which the correlations are probed . regarding the temporal evolution ,",
    "the mfs for isodensity contours turn out to be relatively independent of the ( linear ) growth of the density field , if the value of the threshold density is adjusted accordingly . on the germ - grain side",
    ", there is no corresponding relabeling and , therefore , as we also shall see below , they depend significantly on the amplitude of the power spectrum . besides these conceptual differences , there are some technical advantages to the calculation of germ - grain mfs :    1 .",
    "the evaluation directly uses the point distribution and does not use a smoothing procedure that is an art by itself",
    ". the use of balls does not introduce additional ( smoothing ) parameters .",
    "the construction of smooth surfaces can be noisy if the density is low .",
    "the rougher smoothing procedure in the germ - grain model on the other hand always constructs some well defined surface .    for both smoothing methods",
    "there have been detailed analysis how the values of the measured functionals are related to the parameters of the underlying density distribution . for the germ - grain case we recall this relation in the following section .",
    "due to the simplicity of the geometrical construction as a union of intersecting balls , it is relatively straightforward to relate the germ - grain mfs to correlation properties of the analyzed point distribution . for the case of a poisson distribution",
    "this has been achieved in @xcite , with the only relevant parameter being the density of the random sample . in the presence of structure ,",
    "the dependence on higher order correlations has first been demonstrated in . in the following , we shall use the form derived in @xcite and detailed in the appendix of @xcite . in these works",
    "it has been shown that the ensemble average of the germ - grain mf densities defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minkdens ] ) , for the case of balls as grains , can be expressed in an analytic manner as a function of the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath24 is the ensemble average density of the point distribution studied , and the @xmath25 are the unnormalized modified mfs from the dr7 paper @xcite .",
    "the analytic relation reads    @xmath26    and provides the implicit definition of the @xmath25 . in the rest of the paper we will drop the explicit ensemble averaging brackets and use @xmath27 as a shorthand , as we never refer to the mf density of one individual realization .",
    "we discuss this aspect in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sub : samplingcode ] .    for a poisson distribution ,",
    "the @xmath25 are simply the mfs @xmath28 of the balls of common radius @xmath23 that we use to obtain extended bodies : @xmath29 in the poisson case eq .",
    "( [ eq : minkdensdef ] ) reduces to the result of @xcite . for a point distribution with structure ,",
    "the @xmath25 are modified by weighted integrals of the dimensionless higher - order connected correlation functions @xmath30 .",
    "this modification is what we are interested in in this paper .",
    "it is convenient to define it as a multiplicative dimensionless correction to the poisson value , i.e. to study the quantities @xmath31 we will refer to @xmath32 as the modified mfs .",
    "they can be easily obtained from the quantities we measure , i.e. the average densities @xmath20 , by inverting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : minkdensdef ] ) : @xmath33 in the analysis below , we will mainly use these modified mfs instead of the densities @xmath20 , as they are more directly related to the correlation properties of the point distribution via ( [ eq : minkcorrcon ] ) . from @xcite",
    "the relation of @xmath32 to the correlations of order @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 being simply the mfs of the _ intersection _ of @xmath34 balls .",
    "@xmath38 denotes a ball around the origin and @xmath39 a ball around the point @xmath40 . in our model",
    "all intersecting balls have the same radius @xmath23 . for general germ - grain models ,",
    "this is not a necessary requirement .",
    "one could imagine to increase the weight of some points by assigning them larger radii than other points .",
    "using elliptic or even more irregular grains would also be possible . however , this would complicate the interpretation as we expect that it would lead to a more complicated relation of the functionals to the correlation hierarchy than the one of eq .",
    "( [ eq : minkcorrcon ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath32 of being more directly related to the correlation properties is counterbalanced by an increase in the error . in @xcite we found weaker constraints when using the @xmath25 as compared to the @xmath20 .",
    "the main reason for this is the additional error that is introduced by removing the exponential suppression @xmath41 from @xmath42 in ( [ eq : minkdensdef ] ) . for @xmath43 , for example , @xmath44 so the relative error for the fraction of the volume not covered by any ball enters also for the higher functionals .",
    "this spoils to some extent the good precision that can be obtained for @xmath42 , because @xmath45 has to be measured in the full volume and @xmath42 only on the surface . especially for small @xmath46",
    "it becomes costly to determine @xmath45 well enough .",
    "we will therefore restrict our analysis of the @xmath32 to parameter regions where @xmath46 is larger than @xmath47 .",
    "the modified mfs @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : minkcorrcon ] ) not only depend on our diagnostic parameter , i.e. the radius @xmath23 of the balls that we are using to smooth the galaxy distribution , but also on the sample density .",
    "the rather complicated @xmath23 dependence is entirely encoded in the weight functions @xmath48 in the integrals over correlation functions .",
    "the dependence on the mean density of the galaxy sample @xmath24 , however , is of an easier form .",
    "it is a simple power series in @xmath24 @xmath49 with coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 that contain all of the radius and correlation function dependence .",
    "@xmath52 is the volume of a ball @xmath53 of radius @xmath23 .",
    "we choose to define the second index of @xmath54 such that it directly corresponds to the order of the integrated correlation function .    the formal split into @xmath24 dependence and correlation function dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerseriesdecomp ] ) allows us two things : first , we can remove the poisson part and the part that depends on the two - point correlation function , if we measure the sample density and the two - point correlations independently .",
    "this leaves us with a quantity @xmath55 that only includes higher - order contributions .",
    "this will prove the significance of their contribution to the mfs in sec .",
    "[ sub : highsubtract ] .",
    "second , we can extract the integrals over correlation functions by fitting a polynomial to the density evolution of @xmath56 .",
    "this allows to define a fitting formula for the form of the mfs in the sdss by giving the values and covariances of the coefficients @xmath57 .",
    "we shall use this in sec .",
    "[ sub : seriescoefficients ] .",
    "we close with the remark that , in general , a finite number of coefficients is not sufficient to describe the full shape of a power series of the sort ( [ eq : powerseriesdecomp ] ) . for",
    "cooked up point distributions with small @xmath30 , but a single large @xmath58 at some higher @xmath59 , giving only the lower coefficients will not determine @xmath32 well .",
    "for the assumed structure of the universe as the product of standard structure formation , however , we find that the coefficients @xmath60 are well behaved and the series @xmath32 converges reasonably well ( see sec .  [ sub : seriescoefficients ] ) .      in order to illustrate the relations ( [ eq : minkcorrcon ] ) ,",
    "let us consider the simplest non - trivial case . in analogy with the continuous case",
    ", one can define a gaussian point distribution by the absence of all higher - order connected correlation functions . in this case",
    "the hierarchy of correlations in ( [ eq : minkcorrcon ] ) is truncated after the linear term and we have    @xmath61    the weight functions @xmath62 are non - zero only for the range of @xmath63-values for which the balls intersect . for a coordinate system centered around the origin , i.e. the center of @xmath53 ,",
    "the @xmath40-values therefore lie in a sphere of radius @xmath64 .",
    "a configuration of balls of radius @xmath23 therefore probes the correlation function up to a scale @xmath64 .",
    "we shall therefore plot the radial dependence as a function of the diameter @xmath65 instead of the radius",
    ". for isotropic correlations ( [ eq : minkgaussexp ] ) becomes @xmath66 the shape of the weights @xmath67 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : integrationwindow ] . and their fourier transforms can be found in @xcite ( in the fourier form of @xmath68 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : minkgaussexp-1 ] ) , for a ball radius of @xmath71 .",
    "all functions have been normalized to their maximal value .",
    "the functionals of higher index @xmath72 probe the correlation function at larger distances .",
    "( same plot already in @xcite ) [ fig : integrationwindow],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us just recall that the weights are such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 have a particularly interesting form .",
    "@xmath73 directly contains the amplitude of fluctuations on the scale of the balls @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath74 is a simple integral over the two - point function @xmath77 which could therefore be recovered from the derivative of @xmath74 .",
    "let us pause here and elaborate a bit on the gauss - poisson process as such ( see @xcite for a more complete discussion of what follows ) .",
    "it is tempting to think of the truncated quantities ( [ eq : minkgaussexp-1 ] ) as being the mfs of a point distribution that represents the gaussian limit of an actual point distribution that has higher - order correlations .",
    "however , in general there will not be a gauss - poisson point process that actually realizes these mfs , as in order for a gauss - poisson process to exist , @xmath78 and @xmath24 have to fulfill certain conditions .    already in the continuum case ,",
    "the clustering amplitude is limited by the fact that the matter density can only be positive .",
    "the density distribution , therefore , is in any case only approximated by a gaussian .",
    "this approximation of course is , excellent for early times and large scales , but when matter fluctuations @xmath75 grow too large it breaks down .",
    "this is also the point where higher - order correlations become important .    in the same manner ,",
    "the clustering amplitude of a gauss - poisson point process is limited . in this case , however , also the mean density of the point sample @xmath24 plays a role . for low enough density a thinning of the point distribution goes to an approximated poisson distribution .",
    "this effect can compensate larger fluctuations and it can be shown @xcite that the corresponding constraint is @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the fluctuations in the number density of cells @xmath81 stemming from structure ( @xmath82 are the full fluctuations including the poisson term ) , @xmath83 is the volume of one of these cells , and @xmath84 the mean number of particles in such a cell .",
    "this constraint has two interesting implications : first , we can already tell from the amplitude of the two - point function if the field will have a significant amount of higher order clustering .",
    "when we evaluate ( [ eq : fluctconstraint ] ) for the structure that we measure in the boss galaxies , we find that the constraint actually is violated .",
    "second , to study the gaussian limit on large scales it is not sufficient to simply increase the domain size ( the ball size in our case ) . in some cases , where the fluctuations on a region decay faster than its volume",
    "the constraint indicates that the structure for larger cells becomes more gaussian . in general",
    ", however , one will have to reduce the number density . in the continuous case , by smoothing over larger and larger regions , the amplitude of the fluctuations between these regions decreases and the gaussian approximation becomes better and better . in the discrete case ,",
    "the analogous coarse graining procedure involves a subsampling of the density field . in the same way that the number of regions is reduced in the continuous case when averaging the density over larger cells , individual points of the downsampled point distribution represent larger regions .",
    "we will demonstrate this effect in sec .",
    "[ sub : mfdensities ] where we show the mfs for a couple of densities .",
    "the lower this density becomes , the better the gaussian model fits .",
    "in addition to the requirement ( [ eq : fluctconstraint ] ) , @xcite also showed that the correlation function of a gauss - poisson point process has to satisfy @xmath85 and can not be negative    @xmath86    any violation of ( [ eq : fluctconstraint ] )  ( [ eq : xiconst ] ) already implies the existence of higher - order correlations @xmath30 with @xmath87 .",
    "we note finally that the condition ( [ eq : fluctconstraint ] ) prevents ( [ eq : v0-sigma ] ) and therefore the volume fraction @xmath45 in ( [ eq : minkdensdef ] ) from becoming negative .",
    "so we could have derived a similar constraint on a gauss - poisson process from the requirement that @xmath88 .",
    "the procedure we use to measure the functionals is the same as in the dr7 analysis @xcite . as the quantities that are related to the hierarchy of correlation functions via ( [ eq : minkdensdef ] ) are , strictly speaking , the ensemble averages of the mf densities @xmath20",
    ", we approximate these averages by creating randomly subsampled realizations of the point distribution and averaging over their mf densities . mathematically speaking there is no guarantee that these averages should converge to those of an ensemble of independent realizations ( see also @xcite ) , but practically the procedure is working quite well . for studies on small scales one could in principle use subfields of the full survey as independent realizations and perform an average that is then more likely to converge ( even though it also requires the assumption of ergodicity and is only valid approximately as neighboring regions are not completely independent ) . for the scales that we are interested in",
    ", however , there is only one realization of the survey and therefore we use the subsampling . for details on how we generate the samples",

    "then we applied the fitting procedure to these test data and found that for high enough @xmath7 , the coefficients we put in were recovered within the errors estimated by the fluctuations from the mocks . from the results of these test data fits , we determined for every diameter the minimum @xmath7 needed . for the larger diameters this value is lower due to the decreasing contribution of higher orders .",

    "for the global germ - grain mf densities that we study here , there are different quantities that can be extracted .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath213 , for example , indicates for large balls how many extreme voids ( i.e. regions that are further away from any galaxy than @xmath92 ) there are in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the area functional @xmath89 gives an idea of their area and @xmath45 their volume .",
    "more generally , the comparison of the void fraction @xmath46 to the one of a poisson distribution of the same density indicates how inhomogeneously these void regions are distributed .    in fig .",

    "the densities are @xmath214 and @xmath215 . especially for the higher density",
    "the solid poisson lines lie way below the values for the data , so the structure leads to a significantly higher void fraction than we would expect in an unclustered field.[fig : freevolumefraction],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    especially for the higher density of @xmath216 the difference is quite remarkable .",
    "for a diameter of @xmath128 , the volume is a factor of @xmath217 larger than in the poisson case . for the most extreme case of @xmath132 ,",
    "it is nearly @xmath218 . in this latter case",
    "the expected number of galaxies in a ball of diameter @xmath132 would be @xmath219 . with the standard poisson fluctuation one would expect a fraction of @xmath220 to be uncovered .",
    "including the observed structure however , there is @xmath221 of the @xmath222 in our analyzed region that remain uncovered .",
    "of course one has to make sure that this conclusion is not significantly affected by the holes in the survey .",
    "we tested this using the periodic cubic md - patchy mocks and plot the resulting void fractions as purple and green points in fig .",
    "[ fig : freevolumefraction ] . for the region that we evaluated",
    ", the cubic mocks for the difference is small , below @xmath223 for @xmath224 and below @xmath225 for @xmath226 .",
    "however , for the more extreme diameters the deviations will grow , but we do not expect that this affects the general picture .",
    "in this paper , we perform a new analysis that combines minkowski functionals with the standard two - point correlation function to measure the amount of non - gaussianity of the density field .",
    "we find in sec .",
    "[ sub : highsubtract ] that the significance of the higher - order contribution to the mfs is of the order of @xmath227 ( see tab .",

    "this demonstrates that this part of the mfs can be well enough measured to give meaningful constraints on the higher - order properties of the galaxy distribution .",

    "[ fig : modminksubtract ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : chisqmockdat ] that the md - patchy mocks , that were constructed to match the two- and three - point properties of the measured galaxy distribution , match fairly well to the higher - order mfs .",
    "this indicates that as far as the higher - orders accessible by the mfs are concerned , the mock galaxy catalogs are quite good .",
    "there is still some room for improvement as the combined deviation is as large as @xmath228 for some functionals ( see tab .  [ tab : chisqradcomb ] ) , but this might be addressed by a @xmath193 shift in the normalization of the mock power spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : modminkdensdep ] ) .    on the technical side ,",
    "our careful boundary treatment minimizes the effects of the survey geometry on our measurement of the modified mfs ( see fig .  [",

    "the corrected values lie within the error bars of a boundaryless periodic box .",
    "for the qpm mocks , we find a much larger deviation ( beyond @xmath229 ) from the data than for md - patchy ( see tab .  [ tab : chisqmockdat ] ) . as in this case",
    "already the two - point correlations are overnormalized in the range of scales that we are interested in ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : meancorrfun ] ) , a reduction of the amplitude of the initial gaussian field could also help in this case .",
