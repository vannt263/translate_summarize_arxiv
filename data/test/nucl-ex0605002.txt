    "determination of the absolute values of neutrino masses represents a most difficult problem from an experimental point of view . evidence in favour of non - zero neutrino masses and oscillations obtained in most of the relevant neutrino experiments",
    "has made the physics of massive neutrinos a frontier field of research in particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "all the existing terrestrial and astrophysical data indicate that the neutrino masses are by many orders of magnitude smaller than those of other experimentally measured lepton and hadron masses .",
    "such a low value is the most relevant reason for it being extremely difficult to extract the values of neutrino masses from experimental measurements , either directly or indirectly .",
    "this is the main reason why most experimental papers only report a confidence limit interval for such values . in this paper",
    "we report an upper limit for the muon neutrino mass obtained by measuring the radii of curvature of the pion and muon tracks of an event , in which a pion decays into a muon and a muon neutrino , recorded during the runs of the ps 179 experiment at the beam of antiprotons of lear at cern .",
    "the ps 179 experimental apparatus was designed and built for the study of antiproton interactions with light and medium - light nuclei at the lear facility of cern .",
    "the aim of the research was an experimental study of the interaction of antiprotons with nuclei at low energies .",
    "the results obtained provided information on the fundamental nucleon - antinucleon forces , on the interaction of antiprotons with clusters of bound nucleons , on the distribution of nuclear matter , and on properties of highly excited nuclear matter , as well as a restriction on the possible amount of antimatter present in the early universe  @xcite . in order to make the most of the information available on all the secondary charged particles produced in the reactions , in designing the experiment a choice was made of the visualization detection technique , and a self - shunted streamer chamber placed in a magnetic field",
    "such a detector had many advantages .",
    "it was a low density gas target , and , at the same time , it was triggerable , offering a 4@xmath54 acceptance in which highly luminous localized particle tracks could be obtained  @xcite . the low density of the target medium , i.e. of the streamer chamber filling gas at 1 atm pressure , allowed to reveal long charged particle ranges and nuclear fragments .",
    "the experimental apparatus used is sketched in figure  [ figure 1 . ] .",
    "the detector provided stereo pictures of the sensitive chamber volume .",
    "the details of the experimental apparatus have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite where a more complete description of the characteristics and the performances of all the components of the setup can be found .",
    "the runs of the ps 179 experiment were carried out with the streamer chamber filled at 1 atm with different gaseous targets : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath0 .",
    "the stereo pictures of events , recorded on films during the runs , were reprojected onto measuring tables for visual scanning .",
    "the events were measured with a digitized coordinatometer directly on the scanning tables .    in one of the photographs of the @xmath0 run , the beautiful event , reproduced in figure  [ figure 2 .",
    "] , was observed .",
    "it represents a multi - nucleon annihilation  @xcite of an antiproton with a @xmath0 nucleus ( see , also , figure 11 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from the vertex of",
    "the interaction there `` evaporated '' a ( 1.98@xmath570.02 ) mev positive pion .",
    "from the two vertices of the pion and muon decays , three neutrinos were emitted : from the first a muon neutrino and from the second an electron neutrino and a muon antineutrino .",
    "the peculiarity of the event consists in the noticeable length of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 tracks and in their coplanarity .",
    "the temperature of the streamer chamber filling gas was 289 k , the pressure atmospheric , and the target density ( 0.80@xmath570.01 ) mg/@xmath58 .",
    "the magnetic field was 0.8 t ( @xmath59b / b = 10@xmath60 ) .",
    "the tracks have been measured at jinr with a microscope - digitizer .",
    "the recent acquisition of such a microscope made it possible to newly measure the @xmath61e event , reconstructing and digitizing tracks with a very high accuracy .",
    "the pion track has been digitized at 347 points , the muon track at 2037 points and the positron track at 180 points .",
    "all the measured points are approximately equidistant .",
    "each point has been measured with a precision of about @xmath62 mm .",
    "the coordinates of all track points have been used to deduce the radii of curvature and the ranges .",
    "each particle transfers energy by ionization to the surrounding medium and slows down along its path .",
    "a fortran code has been written to estimate the radii of curvature varying along the tracks and the total track lengths .",
    "for each track the best - fit circles were calculated taking into account a fixed number n of points .",
    "starting from the first measured point and taking the subsequent n-1 points , the first radius was calculated .",
    "if n is the total number of points measured along a track , shifting the n points by one along the track , the subsequent n-(n-1 ) radii have been calculated .",
    "we have chosen n = 25 ( a value statistically significant in order to ensure fit stability ) for each track .",
    "program circle of the cern library  @xcite has been included into the code to calculate the best - fit radii of curvature along the tracks .",
    "the initial pion momentum was estimated from all measured points along the first 10 cm of its track , since the range - energy relations ( and tables ) for neon at ntp reveal the energy loss of a 2.00 mev pion to be negligible for path lengths not exceeding 10 cm .",
    "the average radius of curvature of the first 10 cm of the pion track , obtained best - fitting the track with a circle , is corresponding to a momentum ( p = 300br ) of ( 23.50@xmath570.15 ) mev / c .",
    "the agreement between the value of the initial pion momentum and its measured path range of ( 471.5@xmath570.8 ) mm , shows that the pion decay occurred with a momentum of ( 0.05@xmath570.10 ) mev / c .",
    "the same parameters have been measured for the muon track .",
    "the initial muon momentum was estimated from all measured points along the first 12 cm of its track , since , also in this case , the range - energy relations ( and tables ) for neon at ntp reveal the energy loss of a 5.00 mev muon to be negligible for path lengths not exceeding 12 cm .",
    "the value of the average radius of curvature of the first 12 cm of the muon track , obtained with a best - fit circle , is , corresponding to a momentum of ( 29.90@xmath570.15 ) mev / c . in this case , also , the agreement between the initial muon momentum and its measured path range of ( 2616.0@xmath570.8 ) mm shows that the muon decayed with a momentum of ( 0.6@xmath570.6 ) mev / c .",
    "the positron was emitted with a momentum of ( 46.80@xmath570.08 ) mev / c .",
    "the angle between the tangent lines of the pion and muon trajectories at the decay vertex was ( 163.0@xmath571.0 ) deg , and the angle between the muon and positron tracks was ( 107.0@xmath571.0 ) deg .",
    "it should be pointed out that the @xmath61e event of figure  [ figure 2 . ]",
    "is the only existing of this kind whose parameters could be all measured with high precision .      for kinematic and dynamic analysis of the reaction ,",
    "the relations of conservation of momentum and energy have been used .",
    "the pion decay occurs in a plane . at the decay vertex , the muon and the neutrino have flight directions at angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the pion flight direction , respectively . for momentum conservation",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66 for energy conservation @xmath67 combining algebraically the three relations one obtains @xmath68 and @xmath69 from which one can obtain the square of the neutrino mass @xmath70 where only the @xmath71 factor can approach zero and where @xmath72 and always positive .",
    "it is clear that from relation  ( [ m2 ] ) , given the masses of the pion and muon , the momenta of the pion and muon , and the angle @xmath63 , one can calculate the square of the neutrino mass as a function of the above - mentioned parameters .",
    "a point or an interval estimator of an unknown parameter is any statistic whose value is a meaningful guess for the value of the unknown parameter which is assumed to have some fixed value  @xcite .",
    "sometimes experimental measurement may yield non - physical values , when the parameter value is near zero  @xcite . in these cases a statistical procedure can be used for estimation of the upper limit value of the parameter . in the present analysis the neutrino mass is the parameter to be estimated .",
    "the upper limit of the mass of the muon neutrino  @xcite has a value near zero , and is about seven orders of magnitude smaller than the values of the measured experimental quantities of the @xmath54@xmath2@xmath73@xmath74 decay . in determining such a mass in an unbiased approach one would necessarily expect a non - physical result for @xmath75 to occur half of the time",
    "this happens because of the uncertainties of the experimental values of the physical quantities .",
    "one should then make statistical inferences from observation of the squared mass @xmath76m@xmath77 when @xmath75 is negative or near the non - physical region .",
    "@xmath59m@xmath77 is the standard deviation .",
    "it is possible to choose a `` classical '' confidence level _",
    "p _ for the squared mass such that the corresponding classical confidence limit @xmath78 is in the physical region . when the variable @xmath79 has a gaussian distribution the upper limit is @xmath80 at a p@xmath7 confidence level , where @xmath81 = 1.036 , @xmath82 = 1.282 , @xmath83 = 1.645 and @xmath84 = 1.960 ( see ref .",

    "satisfies the probability statement @xmath85 this statement says that @xmath78 has the probability _ p _ of being larger than the true value ( @xmath86 ) , whatever @xmath86 really is .",
    "it means that , if one repeats the experiment many times , and each time one recalculates the value of @xmath78 , then in @xmath87 of the cases @xmath78 will be greater than the true value @xmath86 .      to obtain an interval estimate for the muon neutrino mass from our measurement of the scattering angle and of the momenta of the two charged particles of the decay",
    ", a statistical procedure has been applied .",
    "it takes into account the measured pion and muon momenta and the angle between them .",
    "these are distributed with gaussian p.d.f.s with means equal to the measured values and standard deviations equal to the corresponding measured uncertainties .",
    "a code has been written . using the monte carlo method a set of @xmath88 decays has been generated .",
    "each element of the set has been obtained extracting at random the momenta of the pion and of the muon , and the angle between the two particles assuming the mass values of @xmath89 = ( 139.57018@xmath570.00035 ) mev and @xmath90 = ( 105.658369@xmath570.000009 ) mev , as given in ref .",
    "the three variables were extracted independently of each other .",
    "other relevant quantities were then calculated .",
    "the distributions of @xmath75 , of @xmath71 and of @xmath91 in relation ( [ m2 ] ) have been obtained .",
    "figure  [ figure 4 . ] shows the distributions of @xmath75 ( upper part ) , @xmath71 ( central part ) and of @xmath91 ( lower part ) .    the @xmath75 distribution is gaussian , with a negative mean value and relatively large standard deviation that depends on the uncertainties in the experimentally measured quantities",
    "the @xmath71 distribution is gaussian with a negative mean value and relatively small standard deviation .",
    "both distributions have ratios of the standard deviation to the mean value of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath91 distribution is gaussian but in the physical region , with a mean value of ( 59.7@xmath570.2 ) mev , about two orders of magnitude greater than @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath75 distribution leads to the squared muon neutrino mass @xmath92 which is compatible with zero .",
    "according to the classical method  @xcite , described in section 3.2 , equation  ( [ nove ] ) corresponds to the muon neutrino mass upper limit @xmath93 at the 90@xmath7 confidence level .",
    "this is the lowest estimate of the upper limit value of the muon neutrino mass obtained with a visualizing detector , using all the directly measured kinematic and dynamic parameters of the @xmath54@xmath2@xmath73@xmath74 decay , that is @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath63 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "the last measurement of this kind of events has been performed with a helium filled bubble chamber  @xcite .",
    "because of the density of liquid helium , the muon tracks were only 1 cm long , and composed by about ( 15@xmath572 ) bubbles .",
    "the authors assumed that all the stopped pions decayed at rest .",
    "for this reason they did not use in the analysis the values of the angle @xmath63 and of the momentum of each pion .",
    "it is quite likely that most of the low energy pions decayed in flight .",
    "since then many experiments have been devoted to measuring the muon momentum with higher accuracy .",
