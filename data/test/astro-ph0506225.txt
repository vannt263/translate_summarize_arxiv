    "high mass stars , on account of their luminosities , temperatures and explosive ends , have a disproportionally large effect on the interstellar medium relative to their numbers .",
    "their influence appears to extend down to the scales of star - forming cores and even planet - forming disks .",
    "star formation may be triggered by supernovae shock waves in neighboring clouds ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) but , at closer quarters , it may be stunted by photoionization and evaporation of molecular clumps within hii regions ( hester et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the dramatic _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images of photoevaporating protoplanetary disks , or proplyds , in the orion nebula beginning with odell , wen & hu ( 1993 ) indicate that planet formation may , too , be inhibited .",
    "given that most low - mass stars are born in ob associations ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , it is important to study disk evolution in such harsh environments .",
    "the trapezium cluster in orion is the nearest young , massive star forming region and it is consequently the most intensively studied ( e.g. odell 2001 ) .",
    "approximately 1200 young stars with ages @xmath6  myr have been identified toward the central 1  pc diameter of the cluster core ( mccaughrean et al .",
    "a single star of spectral type o6ep , 1c , dominates the ultraviolet radiation field and ionizes the gas cocoons around nearby low - mass stars .",
    "the ionized gas is unbound and evaporates from the stars .",
    "mass loss rates averaging @xmath7  yrwere first inferred from centimeter wavelength observations by churchwell et al .",
    "the aforementioned hst data showed that many of the ionized knots are tadpole - shaped structures with a tail extending away from 1c  ( odell et al .",
    "1993 ) , and near - infrared imaging revealed low - mass stars at their centers ( mccaughrean & stauffer 1994 ) .",
    "the visibility of the central stars despite the inferred large mass of circumstellar material led all of these authors to suggest that the ionized gas originates from the surfaces of externally photoionized protoplanetary disks .",
    "as the integrated mass loss of a proplyd over the age of the cluster is larger than typical disk masses around t tauri stars , it was immediately apparent that their evolution was largely being dictated by their environment .",
    "the disk mass that remained , however , could not be determined from the observations",
    ". a lower limit can be obtained for the those objects that are seen in silhouette against the bright nebular background but are sufficiently far enough away from 1c  that they are not strongly ionized and do not produce significant optical emission ( odell & wen 1994 ; mccaughrean & odell 1996 ; bally et al .",
    "2000 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 ) . based on its resolved size and a minimum column density to block the background light , mccaughrean et al .",
    "( 1998 ) determined a lower limit to the mass of the giant proplyd 114 - 426 of @xmath8 .",
    "this is twenty times lower than the @xmath9 minimum formation mass of our solar system ( weidenschilling 1977 ) and thus this technique was not able to yield useful constraints on whether the proplyds are viable candidates for planet formation on scales of our own solar system .",
    "disk masses are best measured at longer wavelengths where the dust emission becomes optically thin .",
    "interferometry is essential to resolve the tightly clustered proplyds from each other and also to filter out the strong emission from the background molecular cloud .",
    "mundy , looney , & lada ( 1995 ) used the bima interferometer at @xmath10  mm to image a field around 1c  containing 33 proplyds .",
    "several significant peaks were found , four coincident with proplyds , but the intensity was consistent with free - free emission from ionized gas and they were unable to measure masses . by analyzing the non - detections , however , they were able to place a statistical upper limit of @xmath11 on the average disk mass .",
    "the dust emission increases at shorter wavelengths and the free - free emission decreases . using the ovro array , bally et al .",
    "( 1998a ) imaged two fields containing a total of six proplyds at @xmath12  mm , made a tentative detection of one object and placed upper limits of @xmath13 on the other objects .",
    "lada ( 1999 ) presented a mosaic of two fields at @xmath12  mm with the plateau de bure interferometer that claimed three detections .",
    "the implied masses were @xmath14 but these have not been analyzed in detail .",
    "the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho et al .",
    "2004 ) is ideally suited to a renewed look at this issue . located on mauna kea",
    ", it can operate at shorter wavelengths than other interferometers and is therefore very sensitive to dust emission .",
    "furthermore , it has a relatively large field of view which allows many proplyds to be imaged simultaneously . in this paper",
    ", we present sma observations at @xmath15 m of a single @xmath16 full width half maximum ( fwhm ) field of view toward 23 proplyds around 1c .",
    "we detect five sources and measure the average flux for the rest .",
    "the observations are described in  2 , our results are presented in  3 , and we discuss the implications for planet formation in  4 .",
    "a single field containing 23 proplyds around 1c  was imaged with the sma using six antennae in its compact configuration on november 13 and 14 , 2004 .",
    "the phase center of the observations was @xmath17 , @xmath18 , slightly south - west of 1cto maximize the number of proplyds in the field .",
    "the receivers were tuned in double sideband mode to place the co(32 ) line in the center of the upper sideband .",
    "each sideband provided the correlator with a 2  ghz spectral region separated from the central frequency of 340.7  ghz ( @xmath15 m ) by @xmath19  ghz .",
    "weather conditions were very good , and system temperatures varied from 300 to 700  k over different baselines as the field moved from @xmath20 to @xmath21 elevation .",
    "the amplitude and phase were monitored by alternately interleaving 5-minute integrations of the quasars j0423 - 013 and j0609 - 157 with each 20 minute observation on source .",
    "the stronger j0423 - 013 was used to perform the final calibration , and j0609 - 157 was imaged as a check on the system performance . the bandpass response and flux scaling",
    "were determined from a 30 minute observation of uranus toward the end of each track .",
    "the data for each night were calibrated with the mir software package .",
    "the atmosphere was very stable during both nights and the rms phase error after calibration was @xmath22 on short baselines increasing to @xmath23 on the longer baselines .",
    "the passband , gain , and flux calibrated data from each night were then combined during the imaging process in miriad .",
    "the total integration time on the 1c  field was 9.6 hours .",
    "strong co emission was detected and the continuum data were extracted by summing over the line free channels .",
    "the shortest projected baseline was @xmath24 and the observations are therefore largely insensitive to features with angular scales greater than @xmath25 ( wilner & welch 1994 ) .",
    "this greatly reduces the potential confusion of extended emission from the background molecular cloud ( johnstone & bally 1999 ) .",
    "inversion of the continuum data to create a `` dirty map '' showed a strong source near the edge of the field of view at the @xmath26 gain of the primary beam , coincident with the proplyd 159350 using the nomenclature of odell & wen ( 1994 ) .",
    "this source produced artifacts in the southeast part of the map that proved difficult to clean , and we therefore removed a point source at its location from the visibilities before inverting and cleaning to analyze the other sources in the field .",
    "the cleanest map and lowest rms in the central region was obtained by removing a 45  mjy source but the source properties derived so far outside the primary beam half power point are highly uncertain",
    ". natural weighting of the @xmath27-data resulted in a beamsize of @xmath28 at position angle @xmath29 east of north and the cleaned map that is presented here was restored with a circular @xmath1 beam that has the same area as the naturally weighted beam .",
    "the rms noise noise level is @xmath30  mjy  beam .",
    "contours of the continuum emission are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the lefthand image shows the location of the four trapezium o stars and optically identified proplyds relative to the data .",
    "the righthand image shows the contours overlaid on the hst image from bally et al .",
    "( 1998b ) and shows the morphologies , brightness and colors of the proplyds .",
    "five proplyds were detected within the @xmath16 fwhm of the primary beam with a peak flux greater than @xmath31  mjy  beamand are marked with a red cross in the lefthand image of figure  1 .",
    "the two brightest sources , 163 - 317 and 170 - 337 , were seen in subsets of the data , both lower and upper sidebands , and both the first and second day of observations .",
    "integrated fluxes for the five sources were measured by summing the pixels within the @xmath32 contour level and correcting for primary beam attenuation . the emission from 170 - 337 and",
    "171 - 340 are merged and the flux for each one was estimated by cutting across the @xmath32 contour by eye .",
    "most of the proplyds in the field of view were detected at centimeter wavelengths with the vla ( churchwell et al .",
    "1987 ; felli et al . 1993 ) and have spectral energy distributions that are consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung ( garay , moran , & reid 1987 ) . none of the sources that we have detected are variable at 3.6  cm ( zapata et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that any contribution from gyrosynchrotron emission is small and that we are not seeing a bright flare .    thermal bremsstrahlung emission decreases gradually toward shorter wavelengths but dust emission sharply increases .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the five sma detections are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "a combination of bremsstrahlung and modified ( @xmath33 ) blackbody emission are overlaid .",
    "these fits are poorly constrained due to the small number of data points where the sed slopes are changing .",
    "nevertheless , they are adequate to show that the @xmath15 m flux is dominated by dust emission in all but one case , 167 - 317 , and to estimate the contribution from ionized gas emission in the other four .",
    "the measured sma fluxes , corrected for primary beam attenuation , the peak signal - to - noise ratio , and estimated contribution from bremsstrahlung emission are listed in table  1 .",
    "167 - 317 ( @xmath2orig ) is the brightest proplyd at centimeter wavelengths and in the mundy et al .",
    "3.4  mm map .",
    "the ionized gas emission is strong even at @xmath15 m and our sed fit shows that the dust emission contributes only 4.6  mjy to the measured flux .",
    "there is some scatter in the centimeter fluxes and a 20% uncertainty in the millimeter fluxes , however , so this number is uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , it does not appear to be a significant detection of dust emission .",
    "for the other four sources , however , there is a clear dust excess which allow us to measure the proplyd masses for the first time .",
    "masses were calculated from the dust excess flux at @xmath15 m in the standard way way using a distance to orion of 450  pc and the same hildebrand ( 1983 ) formulation for the grain opacity @xmath34 as in mundy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and bally et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "implicit in this value is a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 and assumptions about the grain properties .",
    "these are discussed further in  4 .",
    "we assumed a lower temperature , 20  k , than previous work based on the average for disks in taurus - auriga ( andrews & williams 2005 ) and because the bulk of the disk dust mass lies in the midplane and is shielded from uv - heating even in the intense radiation field at the center of the trapezium cluster ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) .",
    "masses would be lower by a factor of 3.3 if the dust temperature were 50  k.    eighteen proplyds are undetected within the primary beam fwhm . as with the previous interferometer observations of the proplyds ( mundy et al .",
    "1995 ; bally et al .",
    "1998a ) , we can study the statistics of the non - detections to constrain their collective properties .",
    "the histogram of fluxes in beam - sized apertures around these 18 proplyds is compared to the background in figure  2 . for this comparison ,",
    "a region around each of the five detections was blanked out .",
    "the flux distribution toward the proplyds is offset from that of the background and has a mean of 0.8  mjy  beam .",
    "this is only a marginally significant result , however , as the map is oversampled .",
    "the expected noise in the combination of 18 positions is @xmath35  mjy  beamand the histogram mean is only slightly greater than this .",
    "nevertheless , taken at face value and applying a correction for the mean gain , 0.73 , of the interferometer toward the 18 positions , the intrinsic mean flux of the non - detections is 1.1  mjy , which corresponds to a mass of @xmath36 .",
    "the integrated co map showed several resolved clumps of emission but they did not appear coherent in velocity or centered on any of the proplyds .",
    "the co line is optically thick and traces the gas temperature .",
    "the temperature probably varies more than the column density in the background cloud and the interferometer map is likely picking up hot spots in the molecular cloud - hii region interface rather than the proplyds themselves .",
    "these observations have proven more successful at measuring the masses of the orion proplyds than previous interferometer work because we were able to observe at shorter wavelengths and at higher sensitivity .",
    "our @xmath31  mjy  beam  detection limit corresponds to a mass limit of @xmath37 for individual sources . allowing for the different dust temperature assumptions ,",
    "this is an order of magnitude more sensitive than bally et al .",
    "( 1998a ) who were in turn an order of magnitude more sensitive than mundy et al .",
    "the iram plateau de bure map shown in lada ( 1999 ) covers many of the same objects and includes detections of 170 - 337 , 171 - 340 , and 158 - 327 , though the latter detection is not confirmed in our map .",
    "the 23 proplyds within the primary beam fwhm of our map are listed along with their morphological type , projected distance from 1c , associated stellar mass , and disk radius in table  2 .",
    "the morphology and association with a microjet are taken from the tables in bally et al .",
    "( 1998b , 2000 ) .",
    "distances and disk radii are also measured from the hst images in bally et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "stellar masses are estimated from k - band magnitudes and placement on 1  myr evolutionary tracks by mccaughrean & stauffer ( 1994 ) .",
    "the statistics are meager , but the four dust detections do not have a preferred morphological type and lie at a range of projected distances .",
    "the stellar masses are somewhat uncertain in absolute terms though probably good relative measures and suggest that the detected disks tend to be associated with the more massive ( @xmath38 ) stars .",
    "the conversion from submillimeter flux to disk mass contains many uncertainties in the grain properties and gas - to - dust ratio that are encapsulated in the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the hildebrand ( 1983 ) formulation that we have used assumes an average grain size of @xmath40 m , appropriate to interstellar clouds and is normalized to a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "throop et al . ( 2001 ) and shuping et al . ( 2003 ) show that the typical grain sizes in the outer parts of the giant silhouette proplyd , 114 - 426 , are @xmath41 m . if the grains are spherical , this does not greatly change the value of @xmath39 at 1  mm ( pollack et al",
    ". however , if the grains have aggregated in a fractal manner , the cross - section per unit grain mass may be as much as an order of magnitude higher ( wright 1987 ) and our proplyd mass estimate may be substantially overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "masses would be underestimated if there is dust settling to the disk midplane and grain growth to centimeter sizes and larger ( wilner et al . 2005 ) or if the inner disk is optically thick ( andrews & williams 2005 ) .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio is also highly uncertain .",
    "dust settling to the disk midplane and photoevaporation of the upper disk envelope will tend to decrease the gas - to - dust ratio below the canonical ism value of 100 ( throop & bally 2005 ) leading to an overestimate of the mass using the hildebrand @xmath39 .",
    "we did not clearly detect co emission from any of the proplyds but future observations of other gas tracers that do not deplete and are abundant in the cold , dense disk midplane will help reveal the gas content and dynamics of the disks .    given the uncertainty in the mass calculations , it is instructive to compare the submillimeter fluxes from the proplyds with isolated disks in taurus . after correcting for the greater distance to orion , the proplyd flux distribution is found to more closely match taurus class ii than class i objects ( andrews & williams 2005 ) . as proplyds",
    "lack outer envelopes , this is also their closest morphological match . in this sense , and only for the four dust detections , the trapezium cluster environment appears not to have had a substantial effect on these systems .",
    "the stars within the proplyds have ages @xmath6  myr ( hillenbrand 1997 ) but the evaporation timescales , equal to the disk masses measured here divided by the mass loss rates measured by churchwell et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , are of order @xmath42  yr .",
    "note that if disks were originally more massive , they would have been larger in size and their mass loss rates consequently greater .",
    "thus , the present disk mass divided by the present mass loss rate is a good measure of the proplyd lifetime ( strzer & hollenbach 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting discrepancy in timescales may be due to a younger age , @xmath43  yr , for the ionizing source , 1c , than the rest of the cluster ( johnstone , hollenbach , & bally 1998 ) or a lower average mass loss rate if either the ionized gas recombines before leaving the system ( odell 1998 ) or if the proplyds move on radial , rather than circular , orbits through the cluster ( strzer & hollenbach 1999 )",
    ".    in this regard , it is intriguing to note that three of the four dust detections were at a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 7 , and one at a signal - to - noise ratio of 4 .",
    "a smooth distribution of disk masses with increasing numbers at smaller masses should have resulted in proportionally more detections at lower signal - to - noise .",
    "the number of detections is small but hints at an abrupt mass loss event such as might be expected for close encounters to 1c  on plunging orbits through the cluster .",
    "observations of additional proplyds at a range of distances from 1c  will show the disk mass distribution and the effect of environment more clearly .",
    "if a distance dependent effect is seen , it would suggest that most stars move on approximately circular orbits and the influence on 1c  on planet formation is limited .",
    "if the detection rate does not increase with distance , however , it may be that the orbits are eccentric and that 1c  would then influence large numbers of potential planetary systems as they pass through the center of the cluster .",
    "the effect may be purely destructive through almost complete photoevaporation of a disk but it may also promote the formation of planets via preferential removal of the gas which allows dust disk instabilities to develop ( throop & bally 2005 ) .",
    "the four dust detections have disk masses slightly greater than the @xmath9 minimum mass solar nebula ( weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "the mass loss is concentrated in the outer parts of the disks where the gravitational potential of the central star is weakest and photoevaporation is most effective ( hollenbach , yorke , & johnstone 2000 ) .",
    "the radius of the bound inner region depends on the stellar mass and whether the gas is ionized by euv photons or remains neutral and only heated by the fuv radiation field .",
    "the detected proplyds lie far enough away from 1c  for the second condition to apply and the central @xmath44  au radius of the disks survive if the central stellar mass is @xmath45 ( johnstone et al .",
    "disk radii were measured to be roughly 40  au in 170337 and 171340 ( bally et al .",
    "thus , at most , the outer 50% of their disks will be lost and for a surface density @xmath46 , the surviving mass fraction is at least @xmath47% .",
    "the other two objects probably have smaller disk radii in which case even more of the mass will survive . we conclude that for these four proplyds , at least , the submillimeter emission indicates there is sufficient material bound to the stars to form solar system scale planetary systems .",
    "there are intriguing possibilities for the non - detections too .",
    "we found a statisically positive flux toward the 18 proplyds that lay below our @xmath32 detection limit .",
    "the corresponding ( gas + dust ) mass limit is @xmath36 and the dust - only mass limit is therefore @xmath48 .",
    "that is , even if all the gas were lost from these disks , there would still be enough material to form terrestrial - like planets .",
    "far more sensitive observations would be required to verify this on an individual basis , of course , and it would also be important to average the vla data in a similar way to measure the low level bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "we thank the referee , mark mccaughrean , for his thorough review which helped improve the paper , and the sma staff for carrying out the observations .",
