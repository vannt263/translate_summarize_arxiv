    "among the results of the loop approach to non - perturbative quantum gravity there are several which tell us that the picture of geometry on scales small as compared with our usual scales ( on planckian scales ) looks quite differently from the habitual picture of riemannian geometry .",
    "the usual classical picture seems to arise only on coarse - graining .",
    "the fundamental excitations of the emerging quantum geometry are one - dimensional loop excitations and the whole quantum picture is of essentially discrete , combinatorial character .",
    "( see , for instance , recent works @xcite , which also contain extensive references to the previous papers on the loop approach ) .",
    "let us assume now that we can formulate a reasonable approximation criteria , and for any classical geometry configuration find the set of approximating it quantum states .",
    "it is natural to expect that if the precision of approximation is chosen not too high , there will be a lot of quantum states corresponding to the same ` geometry ' .",
    "it is quite tempting to consider a usual riemannian geometry description as a macroscopical one and to regard all quantum states approximating a riemannian metric as micro - states corresponding to the same macro - state .",
    "this point of view brings up a lot of interesting possibilities .    indeed ,",
    "recall that with distinguishing between macro- and micro - states of a system the notion of entropy arises in statistical mechanics .",
    "entropy is a function which depends on a macroscopic state of the system .",
    "it can be thought of as a function which for each macroscopic state gives the ( logarithm of the ) number of different microscopic states corresponding to this macro - state .",
    "more precisely , the space of states of the system should be divided into compartments , where all micro - states belonging to the same compartment are macroscopically indistinguishable .",
    "then the entropy of a macro - state is given by the logarithm of the ` volume ' of the compartment corresponding to this macro - state .",
    "let us return to our quantum description of geometry .",
    "it is natural to introduce a coarse - graining of the space of quantum states in such a way that quantum states approximating different ` geometries ' belong to different compartments .",
    "having divided the space of states this way , it is natural to introduce the function which for any geometry configuration gives the logarithm of the ` volume ' of the corresponding compartment .",
    "this gives rise to the notion of _ geometrical entropy_. thus , geometrical entropy tells ` how many ' there are different quantum states which correspond to a given geometry configuration . to be more precise , in the cases when a compartment is itself a linear space the entropy is given by the logarithm of the dimension of the corresponding compartment .    in this paper",
    "we try to implement the idea of geometrical entropy following a very simple choice of the ` ensemble ' of quantum states .",
    "although some of our results are surprising , the aim of this paper is not to argue a physical significance of the results obtained .",
    "rather , in order to understand if the general idea of geometrical entropy makes sense , we consider a particularly simple case , in which the analysis can be accomplished , and develop a technique that may prove to be useful for future developments .",
    "our choice of the ` ensemble ' of quantum states is as follows .",
    "first , we restrict our consideration to the gravitational degrees of freedom of an arbitrarily chosen in space 2-dimensional surface .",
    "namely , we consider lorentzian 3 + 1 general relativity in the framework of ( real ) ashtekar variables , and the quantization given by the loop quantum gravity . we restrict our consideration to the gravitational system induced by the full theory on some 2-surface @xmath5 embedded in the spatial manifold @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom of our system are just the degrees of freedom of general relativity that live on a surface @xmath5 .",
    "second , we specify a macro - state of our system simply fixing the total area of the surface @xmath5 . in this case , as we shall see later , it is easy to pick up all quantum states which approximate a given macro - state , and the analysis becomes almost straightforward .",
    "thus , to illustrate the general idea of geometrical entropy we stick here to the case when a macro - state of our system is specified simply by the total area @xmath1 of the surface .",
    "let us note that such a statistical mechanical consideration of surface degrees of freedom is of a special interest because of its possible connection with the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , there is a common believe that it is the degrees of freedom living on the horizon surface of a black hole which account for the black hole entropy . to try to reveal the connection between quantum gravity and thermodynamics that is suggested by black hole physics is one the motivations for our investigation .",
    "the other , and maybe even more important motivation is that the loop quantum gravity itself is a new approach .",
    "in such a situation it is necessary to apply the formalism to simple problems , just in order to see if it gives a reasonable picture .",
    "the set of problems concerning statistical properties of the theory might serve as one of such tests .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we remind briefly how the surface quantum states look like and discuss the issue of correspondence between macro- and micro - descriptions . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we calculate geometrical entropy of surface degrees of freedom considering the case of an open surface .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] contains a generalization of our result to the case of closed surfaces .",
    "we conclude with the discussion .",
    "let us recall the description of general relativity in terms of ( real ) ashtekar variables . in the hamiltonian framework",
    "general relativity can be formulated as a theory of @xmath7-connection over the spatial manifold .",
    "the connection field plays the role of a configurational variable ; the momentum variable is presented by the canonically conjugated field .",
    "the dynamics of the theory is determined by a set of constraint functionals .",
    "the degrees of freedom induced on an arbitrarily chosen surface @xmath5 are described by pull - backs of the connection and momentum fields into @xmath5 , which we shall denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively ( @xmath10 stands for two component spinor indices ) .",
    "the ` surface ' momentum field @xmath9 carries information about 2-metric on @xmath5 .",
    "let us describe the quantum theory .",
    "the loop quantization of 3 + 1 general relativity is described in details in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to recall that there exists an orthogonal decomposition of the hilbert space of gauge invariant states of quantum general relativity into subspaces , which are labeled by the so - called spin network states .",
    "spin network states are labeled by closed graphs in @xmath6 with spins ( or , equivalently , with irreducible representations of the gauge group ) assigned to each edge and intertwining operators assigned to each vertex of graph .",
    "let us now specify the space of quantum surface states . given a 2-d ( not necessarily closed ) surface @xmath5 embedded into the spatial manifold @xmath6 and a 3-d spin network @xmath11",
    "one can consider the intersection of this spin network with @xmath5 .",
    "let us call the intersection points vertices .",
    "generally , there can be vertices of any valence not less then two ( valence of a vertex is the number of edges of a spin network state which meet in this vertex ) .",
    "also , there can be edges lying entirely on the surface @xmath5 among the edges of @xmath11 ; we shall call such edges tangential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the intersection of @xmath11 with the surface @xmath5 defines what we shall call a surface spin network on @xmath5 .",
    "a surface spin network is a graph lying entirely on the surface @xmath5 , with spins assigned to each edge , and intertwining operators assigned to each vertex .",
    "the intertwiners assigned to each vertex are just those of the corresponding 3-d spin network .",
    "this means that vertices of a 2-d surface spin network ` remember ' what were the spins of the edges incident at the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "note that our definition of a surface spin network is not the canonical one .",
    "a ` canonical ' surface spin network is defined as a graph lying on the surface , with spins assigned to each edge , and intertwiners assigned to each vertex .",
    "we use the term ` surface spin network ' simply to denote the intersection of a 3-d spin network with the surface @xmath5 , or , in other words , to denote the ` surface ' part of information carried by a 3-d spin network . to avoid confusion",
    ", we shall also use the term ` generalized surface spin network state ' .",
    "the simples non - trivial example of a surface spin network is that coming from a single edge intersecting the surface @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "such a spin network is simply the point @xmath12 on @xmath5 , with the intertwining operator being the map from the one copy of the representation space @xmath13 ( @xmath14 here is the spin labeling the irreducible representation of @xmath7 ) to the other copy of @xmath13 .",
    "the intertwiner in this case is specified ( up to an overall constant ) simply by the spin @xmath14 attached to the vertex @xmath12 .",
    "we define the space @xmath15 of surface quantum states as the space spanned by all ( generalized ) surface spin network states .",
    "this definition means that the basis in @xmath15 is formed by surface spin network states , what gives us all that we need for our counting purposes .",
    "we can now recall that there exists a set of well defined operators @xmath16 , which ` measure ' quantum geometry of @xmath5 .",
    "these operators correspond to areas of various regions @xmath17 of the surface @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that 3-d spin network states are eigenstates of operators @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath18 note that we measure areas in the units of @xmath19 , which is convenient in the loop quantum gravity . here",
    "the sum is taken over all vertices @xmath12 lying in the region @xmath17 of the surface @xmath5 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the total spins of edges lying up , down the surface and tangential to the surface ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "although these operators are defined on 3-d quantum states , the eigenvalues ( [ qarea ] ) depend only on the ` surface ' part of the information carried by a 3-d spin network state .",
    "therefore , we can think of @xmath22 as operators defined on the ( generalized ) surface spin network states , with eigenvalues given by ( [ qarea ] ) .",
    "as we have said in the introduction , in this paper we are going to consider a geometrical entropy that corresponds to a macro - state specified simply by a total surface area @xmath1 .",
    "for this simple case , the approximation criterion between macro- and micro - descriptions is straightforward .",
    "namely , we can say that a quantum state ( micro - state ) approximates a given macro - state if the mean value of the operator @xmath23 in this quantum state is approximately equal to the fixed value @xmath1 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that quantum states approximating total surface area form a linear subspace in the space of all surface states .",
    "its dimension is equal to the number of different surface spin network states approximating @xmath1 .",
    "let us see now how many different quantum states approximate a given total area .",
    "it is easy to see that this number is infinite .",
    "indeed , loops on the surface , which are the simplest possible parts of a surface spin network state , do not give any contribution to the areas .",
    "therefore , one has an infinite number of spin networks which approximate one and the same total area of @xmath24 being different only in configurations of loops on the surface .",
    "one can argue , however , that this happens because , using terminology from statistical mechanics , a macro - state of our system is not completely specified when we fix only a total area of the surface .",
    "indeed , areas of regions on @xmath5 carry information only about degrees of freedom described by @xmath25 field .",
    "but there are also degrees of freedom described by the pull - back of the connection field on the surface which one should take care of when specifying a macro - state .",
    "our guess is that different configurations of loops on the surface from the above example correspond to different classical configurations of the connection field on @xmath5 . indeed , as we know , in classical theory loop quantities are constructed as traced holonomies of the connection , and , therefore , are just those objects which carry information about the connection field .",
    "therefore , since we want to forget about degrees of freedom described by the field @xmath26 when we specify a macro - state , to be consistent we have also to forget about those quantum states which , as we believe , contribute to @xmath26 and do not contribute to the area of @xmath5 .",
    "let us , therefore , consider only quantum states which contribute to the areas of regions on @xmath5 , but do not ` contribute ' to the connection field on the surface .",
    "these , according to our guess , are the states which contain no loops on the surface .",
    "we shall call the corresponding spin networks _",
    "open _ spin networks .",
    "a ( generalized ) surface spin network is called open if the ( surface ) graph that labels it contains no closed paths ( or no loops ) .",
    "the simplest open spin network state is the spin network containing a single vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .    now , to find the entropy which corresponds to a macro - state of a fixed total surface area @xmath1 we should calculate the number of quantum states which approximate @xmath1 , taking into account only open spin networks .",
    "however , let us first analyze the problem taking into account only some particularly simple spin network states , and then try to generalize the result obtained .",
    "let us consider spin networks whose vertices are bivilent , i.e. , those specified simply by sets of points ( vertices ) on the surface with spins assigned to these points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "points on the surface with spins assigned are sometimes called punctures ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and we shall use this name as well .",
    "so quantum states which we consider now are specified by sets of punctures on the surface .    for these simple quantum states there exists a simplified version of the formula ( [ qarea ] ) .",
    "namely , a set @xmath27 of punctures gives the area of a region @xmath17 on @xmath5 @xmath28 here the sum is taken over all punctures which lie in the region @xmath17 and @xmath29 are the corresponding spins . to get the total area of the surface we just have to sum over all punctures @xmath30 .    with these simple states the problem of calculating the entropy becomes almost straightforward .",
    "let us use the standard trick . instead of counting states which correspond to the same area we shall take a sum over _ all _ states but take them with different statistical weight .",
    "namely , let us consider the sum @xmath31 over all different states @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a parameter . considering @xmath34 as a _ probability _ of our system to be found in a state @xmath11 , it is easy to see that the _ mean _ value of the area in such statistical state is @xmath35 the entropy of the system in this macro - state is given by the standard formula @xmath36 or , as it is easy to check , by @xmath37    we see that the mean value of the surface area depends on @xmath3 . if statistical ` ensemble ' of states is chosen properly , then one can adjust the value of @xmath3 in such a way that @xmath38 acquires any prescribed value .",
    "there is some particular value of @xmath5 which corresponds to the chosen value of @xmath1 . excluding @xmath3 in such a way we obtain the entropy as a function of the area @xmath39 .",
    "statistical mechanics tells us that when the density @xmath40 of states of our system grows sufficiently fast with @xmath1 it is of no difference which way of calculating @xmath0 to choose ; one can count the logarithm of the number of different states which give one and the same area or calculate the function @xmath0 as described - the results will not differ .",
    "let us note that @xmath0 calculated through ( [ sa ] ) will be meaningful only for large @xmath1 ( as compared with unity , i.e. with the planckian area ) .",
    "this is really what we need because only in this case the notion of approximation and , therefore , the notion of entropy acquires sense .",
    "let us now discuss whether all the sets of @xmath27 should be taken into account in ( [ statsum ] ) .",
    "first of all , let us recall that we have to count not the surface spin networks themselves but the diffeomorphism equivalence classes of spin networks .",
    "this means that two surface spin networks which can be transformed on into another by a diffeomorphism on the surface should be considered as a single state in ( [ statsum ] ) .",
    "thus , the continuous set of data @xmath41 ( @xmath42 runs all over the surface @xmath5 ) reduces simply to a set of spins @xmath43 when one identifies sets of punctures which can be mapped one into another by a diffeomorphism on the surface ( note , however , the discussion following the next paragraph ) .",
    "next , we note that , if the surface @xmath5 is a closed one , not every set @xmath41 can be obtained as a result of intersection with @xmath5 of some 3-d spin network in @xmath6 .",
    "namely , the sum @xmath44 , which is the total spin which ` enter ' the surface must be an integer for gauge invariant states .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that not all eigenvalues given by the formula ( [ qarea ] ) are eigenvalues of the area of a closed surface , as it was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "let us consider in this section only a simpler case of an open surface @xmath5 ; we return to the case of a closed surface in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .    and , finally , let us consider the states specified by the following two set of punctures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) @xmath45    these two states differ one from another only at two points @xmath46 ; they give the same total area of the boundary .",
    "should we distinguish these two states or consider them as a single physical state ?",
    "it turns out that this is the key question which determines the form of the dependence of the entropy @xmath0 on the area @xmath1 of the surface .",
    "let us now consider these states as _ different _ and postpone the discussion of such a choice to the last section .",
    "so let us denote by @xmath47 the number of states which correspond to one and the same area @xmath1 in the case when all the sets ( [ states ] ) are regarded as specifying different states .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath47 is the number of _ ordered _ sets of punctures which approximate the total area @xmath1 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute @xmath47 using our method with the statistical sum .",
    "one can easily check that the fact that we regard the sets ( [ states ] ) as specifying different states ( or , equivalently , the fact that we count ordered sets of punctures ) means that we can sum over the spin of each puncture _ independently _ @xmath48 the first sum here denotes the sum over the number of possible punctures on @xmath5 and the subsequent ones denote the summation over the possible spins .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 note that the sum here runs over all positive integers and half - integers .",
    "one can expect that @xmath52 will increase as @xmath3 gets smaller because in any case ( [ 1 ] ) diverges when @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "however , we see that ( [ 2 ] ) diverges even for some finite value of @xmath53 such that @xmath54 ( we shall see in a minute to which value of @xmath3 this corresponds ) . when @xmath3 gets smaller and approaches @xmath53 , @xmath52 increases and diverges at the point @xmath53 .",
    "it can easily be checked that @xmath38 and @xmath55 also diverge when @xmath56 .",
    "this means that changing @xmath3 slightly we will obtain substantial differences in values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "what we are interested in is the dependence @xmath0 for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "but we see that all large values of @xmath1 can be obtained by small changes in @xmath3 when @xmath56 .",
    "thus , from ( [ sa ] ) we conclude that for @xmath57 @xmath58 here we neglected the term @xmath59 which is small comparatively with the main term ( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "this result tells us that entropy grows precisely as the first power of area of the boundary .",
    "now let us see what @xmath53 amounts to .",
    "one can do this numerically but it is also straightforward to find an approximate value . note that @xmath50 can be rewritten as the sum over integers",
    "@xmath60 the term under the square root in the exponential can be given the form @xmath61 .",
    "because the sum starts from @xmath62 we can neglect the unity comparatively to a larger term .",
    "then @xmath50 can be easily computed @xmath63 this gives for the @xmath64 the value @xmath65 .",
    "an explicit numerical investigation of the equation @xmath54 gives a close value @xmath66 .",
    "so we have shown that for large values of @xmath1 the entropy depends on the area as @xmath67",
    "as we have mentioned before , in the case of closed surfaces @xmath68 we have to take into account the fact that not all eigenvalues given by the formula ( [ qarea ] ) are eigenvalues of the operator @xmath69 , which measures the total area of the surface .",
    "namely , in the case of a closed surface @xmath68 gauge invariant quantum states are those which satisfy the condition that the sums @xmath70 and @xmath71 over all vertices lying on the surface are integers @xcite ( spins @xmath20 are those defined after the formula ( [ qarea ] ) .",
    "this condition means that for the case of a closed surface some spin network states should be excluded from the sum ( [ statsum ] ) .",
    "recall that our result essentially follows from the fact that the statistical sum @xmath52 diverges when @xmath3 approaches some _ finite _ value @xmath53 . because we have to drop some positive terms from the statistical sum corresponding to a closed @xmath68",
    ", @xmath52 can prove to be convergent for all @xmath33 and as a result we would obtain some other ( non - linear ) dependence @xmath0 . ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that geometrical entropy @xmath0 of ( ordered ) sets of punctures , considered in the previous section , for a closed surface @xmath5 still depends linearly on the total surface area .",
    "so , again , our states are specified by ordered sets @xmath72 of punctures on the surface .",
    "however , in the case of a closed surface , not all sets of punctures correspond to gauge invariant physical states .",
    "namely , in our case gauge invariant states are those for which @xmath73 is an integer . to find the number of different states which approximate one and the same total area we can again apply our trick with the statistical sum .",
    "the statistical sum @xmath52 will be given by the expression ( [ 1 ] ) , where we have to take into account only the states satisfying the above condition .",
    "it is not hard to calculate the statistical sum @xmath52 for our case of a closed surface @xmath5 .",
    "let us divide the function @xmath50 given by ( [ z ] ) into two parts @xmath74 .",
    "function @xmath75 is the sum over all integer values @xmath76 of spin @xmath14 @xmath77 function @xmath78 is the sum over all half - integers @xmath79 @xmath80 let us rewrite the statistical sum @xmath52 over all sets of punctures in terms of the functions @xmath81 introduced @xmath82 a moment of reflection shows that in order to get the statistical sum corresponding to the case of a closed surface , we have to drop from ( [ q1 ] ) all terms which contain odd powers of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath84 here @xmath81 are functions of @xmath3 .",
    "recall now that our statistical mechanical system has a regime in which the entropy depends linearly on the area in the case when the statistical sum diverges for some finite value of @xmath3 .",
    "let us , therefore , investigate the behavior of @xmath85 when @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "first , let us note that @xmath86 also , we note that @xmath87 , because the sum in @xmath78 starts from @xmath88 , whereas the sum in @xmath89 is taken over all integer values of spin and starts from @xmath90 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the statistical sum @xmath85 diverges for @xmath91 .",
    "but @xmath92 , so the value of @xmath53 here is the solution of equation @xmath54 obtained in the previous section .",
    "thus , we get that @xmath93 where @xmath53 is the same as in ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "thus , we have proved that , although the statistical sum @xmath94 for the case of a closed surface is different from @xmath52 corresponding to the case of an open @xmath5 , it implies the linear dependence @xmath95 of the entropy on the surface area , with the proportionality coefficient @xmath53 being the same as in the case of an open surface .",
    "one can say that , although we excluded some states from the statistical sum , there are still ` enough ' states to give the same linear dependence of the entropy on @xmath1 as in the case of an open surface .",
    "the result which we have obtained considering some particularly simple surface quantum states is that the entropy corresponding to a macro - state which is specified by a total area @xmath1 of the surface is proportional precisely to the area @xmath1 .",
    "it is important that we have obtained precisely the same dependence @xmath0 both for the case of open and closed surfaces @xmath5 .",
    "the entropy was defined as the logarithm of the number of different quantum states that approximate one and the same area of the surface .",
    "the states which we considered were specified simply by the sets of punctures on the surface .",
    "it is crucial that the states which are different only up to a permutation of spins ( see fig.[fig:5 ] ) were considered as different quantum states .",
    "one of the reasons why we postponed the discussion of the key point of distinguishing the states ( [ states ] ) was to emphasize the importance of this choice .",
    "this is this choice which implies the linear dependence of entropy @xmath0 on the surface area .",
    "as we show in the appendix , in the case when states ( [ states ] ) are considered as indistinguishable , the dependence of the entropy on the areas is different form the linear one ( in fact , the entropy turns out to be proportional to the square root of the area ) .    before discussing this key point , let us note that our aim in this paper is not to give a physical motivation for some particular choice of the ensemble of quantum states .",
    "rather we wanted to show how the entropy arises naturally when one considers correspondence between classical and quantum pictures of geometry .",
    "we also wanted to illustrate this idea following some simple choice of the ensemble of quantum states , and to present a technique which turns out to be useful . having this in mind , let us discuss our choice of considering the states ( [ states ] ) as distinguishable ones .",
    "we were counting the number of different diffeomorphism equivalence classes of ( simple ) surface spin networks approximating one and the same total surface area .",
    "this means , that two surface spin networks which can be transformed one into another by a diffeomorphism on the surface should have been considered as specifying the same micro - state .",
    "let us now consider the two states ( [ states ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see , that there exists a diffeomorphism which maps one state into the other ; this diffeomorphism simply rearranges two points @xmath46 on the surface .",
    "therefore , on the first sight , the states ( [ states ] ) should have been considered as a single state .",
    "does this mean that the result obtained is physically meaningless and is simply an exercise in statistical mechanics ? .",
    "there are some reasons to believe that the result obtained is more than that .",
    "so let us give some possible motivations for our strange choice of considering states ( [ states ] ) as different quantum states .",
    "one possibility , which is argued by carlo rovelli @xcite , is that points on the surface are physically distinguishable , and so are the states ( [ states ] ) .",
    "this , in fact , happens in the case of some systems for which the surface @xmath5 play the role of the boundary",
    ". it might be the case that _ boundary conditions _ partly ( or even completely ) brake diffeomorphism invariance on the boundary .",
    "this would mean that some spin networks which are usually considered as specifying one and the same quantum state , should , in fact , be considered as different quantum states .",
    "this case of systems with boundaries is subtle and deserves a special attention .",
    "let us only note the possible connection of our result , viewed from this point , with the results of steven carlip @xcite .",
    "the other possibility , which has also been argued in @xcite , is that some other ( in fact , loop ) states on the surface make some of the states ( [ states ] ) belong to different diffeomorphism equivalence classes of spin networks .",
    "indeed , the surface loop states which we considered as giving no contribution to the areas , and , thus , forgot about , may affect largely the number of different diffeomorphism equivalence classes of states which approximate one and the same area of @xmath5 . to see this ,",
    "let us introduce a loop configuration on the surface .",
    "this loop configuration divides the surface into regions .",
    "it is clear that some of the states ( [ states ] ) will belong to different equivalence classes , for there will no longer be a diffeomorphism ` connecting ' different regions .",
    "thus , the number of different diffeomorphism equivalence classes which approximate one and the same total area @xmath1 in this case is larger that in the case when there are no loops on the surface .",
    "so loops on the surface may allow one to distinguish states of the form ( [ states ] ) ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , neither of these motivations gives a final physical justification of the result obtained .",
    "but let us repeat that this is not what we aimed at in this paper .",
    "we hope , however , that the above discussion shows at least that the issue deserves a further investigation .",
    "finally , let us discuss the possibility to generalize the result obtained considering arbitrary open surface spin network states .",
    "first , let us take into account surface spin networks which have no tangential edges , allowing , however , vertices of arbitrary valence . in this case",
    "we have to use a general formula ( [ qarea ] ) for eigenstates of area operators ( with all @xmath96 being equal to zero because of the fact that we consider spin networks with no tangential edges ) .",
    "we would like to generalize our result counting all ( open ) surface spin networks which approximate one and the same total surface area .",
    "however , we face the problem trying to consider all states .",
    "namely , eigenvalues given by the formula ( [ qarea ] ) are degenerate and we have to take this degeneracy into account when calculating the entropy .",
    "let us consider , for example , a simple state , which contains one vertex of valence two ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .    for this state",
    "we get @xmath97 , and , therefore , @xmath98 .",
    "a moment of consideration shows that there are , in fact , an infinite number of similar surface states that do not give any contribution to the area of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we find that eigenvalue @xmath99 is infinitely degenerate . similarly , we find that _ all _ eigenvalues given by the formula ( [ qarea ] ) are infinitely degenerate . therefore , if we would like to take into account all different surface states we would get an infinite value for our geometrical entropy .",
    "let us note , however , that the states which we have just considered are rather pathological .",
    "namely , we observe that small deformations of the surface @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) ( with the spin network state being not deformed ) cause a change in the ` quantum area ' of @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a one parameter family of surfaces @xmath100 $ ] such that @xmath101 when @xmath102 .",
    "for our example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) , if surfaces @xmath103 approach the surface @xmath5 from below we have @xmath104 ( here by @xmath105 we denote an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath69 on the quantum state we consider ) . however , if we choose the family of surfaces approaching @xmath5 from above we have @xmath106 ( we measure areas in the units @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus , we see that states which cause the degeneracy are ` pathological ' when considered as surface states , for ` quantum area ' of @xmath5 in this states behaves non - continually under small deformations of @xmath5 .",
    "this observation , which the author learned from a.ashtekar , suggests that we have to exclude these states when we consider an ensemble of surface states . a natural way to do it would be to change the approximation criterion between macro- and micro - descriptions .",
    "namely , let us strengthen our criterion in the following way .",
    "we fix a value @xmath1 of the total area of @xmath5 , which defines our macro - state .",
    "we choose one parameter family @xmath103 of two - surfaces such that @xmath107 .",
    "let us now say that a spin network state @xmath11 approximates our macro - state if @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the eigenvalue of operator @xmath110 corresponding to the eigenstate @xmath11 .",
    "the new approximation criterion states that we have to consider only ` good ' surface quantum states . by definition , ` quantum area ' of @xmath5 in ` good ' surface quantum states does not change under small deformations of the surface @xmath5 .",
    "it is easy to see , that ` good ' quantum states are those which have only bivilent vertices , i.e. precisely those states which we considered in this paper .",
    "thus , we conclude that the result obtained above gives the geometrical entropy @xmath0 of a macro - state of a fixed total area @xmath1 , the quantum states that account for this entropy being all states which approximate @xmath1 in the strong sense , i.e. , those for which ` quantum area ' does not change under small deformations of the surface @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the entropy @xmath0 is the same both for open and for closed surfaces .",
    "thus , the result obtained is general in the sense that we consider all quantum surface states which approximate @xmath1 in the strong sense .",
    "let us conclude saying that the notion of geometrical entropy is , presumably , valid not only in the form explored here ( when we fixed only one macroscopic parameter  the surface area ) , but also in a more general context .",
    "for example , it is of interest to calculate the entropy @xmath111 which corresponds to a given 2-metric on the surface , which is a genuine geometrical entropy .",
    "i am grateful to yuri shtanov for the discussions in which the idea of geometrical entropy developed and for important comments on the first versions of the manuscript .",
    "i would like to thank a.ashtekar , a.coricci , r.borisov , s.major , c.rovelli , l.smolin and j.zapata for discussions , comments and criticism .",
    "i am grateful to a.ashtekar from whom i learned the idea of sequences of surfaces , which is used here to formulate the ` strong ' approximation criterion .",
    "i would also like to thank the banach center of polish academy of sciences for the hospitality during the period when this paper was started .",
    "this work was supported , in part by the international soros science education program ( issep ) through grant no .",
    "in this appendix we would like to show that the entropy @xmath0 in the case when one considers sets ( [ states ] ) as undistinguishable is proportional to the square root of the area .    since we do not distinguish between sets ( [ states ] ) , all states @xmath11 which enter ( [ statsum ] ) are just unordered sets @xmath112 of spins .",
    "one can describe each such state by a set @xmath113 of numbers of spins @xmath114 in this state .",
    "it is convenient to imagine each state defined by a set @xmath112 as a collection of different particles .",
    "particles of a particular sort @xmath14 correspond to punctures carrying the spin @xmath14 .",
    "there can be many particles of the same sort in a state and we denote the corresponding number of such particles by @xmath115 . having this analogy in mind it is easy to see that our case the statistical sum @xmath52 is given by @xmath116 here by @xmath117 we denoted the contribution to the area from a single ` particle ' of the sort @xmath14 @xmath118 note that the sum over @xmath14 starts from @xmath88 and runs over all positive integers and half - integers .",
    "it is straightforward to take the sum over numbers @xmath115 of different ` particles ' in ( [ s2 ] ) ; this gives @xmath119 the area as a function of parameter @xmath3 is given by the formula ( [ a1 ] ) . in our case",
    "it gives @xmath120 to see what dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 this implies we replace the sum over spins @xmath14 by the sum over integers ( colors ) @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 . for values of @xmath123",
    "we have the following approximation @xmath124 let us now approximate the sum over @xmath14 in ( [ 3 ] ) by the following integral over @xmath76 @xmath125 it is easy to see that this integral is equal to @xmath126 recall now that we are interested in the dependence @xmath0 for large values of @xmath1 ( as compared with unity ) .",
    "we see from ( [ 4 ] ) that large values of @xmath1 correspond to small @xmath3 . in the limit",
    "@xmath127 the integral in ( [ 4 ] ) can easily be calculated @xmath128 so , finally , for large values of @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , for small @xmath3 ) , we have the following dependence @xmath129 this gives the dependence @xmath0 of the entropy on the area .",
    "namely , in the limit of large @xmath1 we can neglect the logarithmic term in ( [ sa ] ) as compared with the larger first term .",
    "thus , we get @xmath130 so , in the case when one considers unordered sets of punctures , the geometrical entropy @xmath0 is proportional to the square root of the area ."
