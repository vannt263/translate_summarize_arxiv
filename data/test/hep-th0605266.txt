    "soon after the invention of inflationary cosmology it was realized that inflation may divide our universe into many exponentially large domains corresponding to different metastable vacuum states @xcite .",
    "the total number of such vacuum states in string theory can be enormously large @xcite .",
    "a combination of these two facts with the kklt mechanism of vacuum stabilization @xcite gave rise to what is now called the string landscape scenario @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify some features of the landscape . in particular",
    ", one may wonder what are the properties of the domain walls separating different vacua , how these domains may form , and how large will be the fraction of the volume of the universe inside different domains .    to this end",
    ", we will construct a broad class of static bps domain wall solutions interpolating between different ads or minkowski vacua with unbroken supersymmetry . quite generally",
    ", these bps domain walls may interpolate between various minima , maxima , or saddle points of the scalar field potential .",
    "bps domain wall solutions in 4-dimensional @xmath3 supergravity were first studied in @xcite .",
    "the methods used for that analysis have been later refined and generalized to a variety of models , for different number of dimensions and supersymmetries , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our present aim is to further extend these methods to make them suitable for investigation of the string landscape scenario . following the logic of the recent developments",
    ", we will begin with an investigation of the supersymmetric vacua arising from flux compactifications prior to the kklt uplifting , and later introduce the more physically relevant metastable de sitter vacua .",
    "we start in section 2 with an overview of some known features of domain walls in effective d=4 , n=1 supergravity .",
    "the new results here include the derivation of bps domain wall gradient flow equations in generic models with f - term potentials with arbitrary khler potential , superpotential and number of moduli .",
    "we rewrite the gravitational action , including the boundary @xmath4-terms in a bps form : when the flow equations are satisfied , the integrand of the action defines the bps domain wall tension . afterward , in the spirit of the analogous work in five dimensions in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , where domain walls are viewed as dual to renormalization group flows @xcite , we present the bps flow equations in the form of rg flows and provide the relevant `` c - theorem '' .    in section 3 we give examples of bps domain walls where the potential has more than one critical point but there is no barrier between them .",
    "our examples include an ads minimum and an asymptotically minkowski vacuum .",
    "other examples have critical points at finite distance in the moduli space : an ads saddle point and an ads minimum , or an ads maximum and an ads saddle point . a particularly interesting case of flux vacua area codes in a calabi  yau hypersurface required the study of the flow of four moduli .",
    "they flow from one critical point of the potential , the landau ",
    "ginsburg fixed point , towards the second critical point with larger absolute value of the cosmological constant near the conifold .",
    "in section 4 we study a class of models in stringy landscape with a barrier between critical points .",
    "we have examples of a local minkowski or ads minimum and another absolute ads minimum of larger absolute value of the cosmological constant . in case of ads - ads wall",
    ", we display the domain walls with critical and super - critical tension .",
    "the last case has the superpotential crossing zero between two ads vacua .",
    "the results of our investigation in sections 2 - 4 directly apply to the transitions between supersymmetric ads and minkowski vacua .",
    "however , the most interesting parts of the string theory landscape correspond to ds vacua .",
    "these vacua can be obtained from supersymmetric ads or minkowski vacua by uplifting , which can be achieved , e.g. , by adding some anti - d3 branes @xcite .",
    "this procedure breaks supersymmetry and may destabilize some of the vacua , in particular those which corresponded to maxima and saddle points . as a result",
    ", some of the bps wall solutions may disappear after the uplifting , whereas some others will remain .",
    "however , instead of describing the static bps domain walls , they will describe domain walls moving with acceleration .",
    "such domain walls can be formed during the tunneling and bubble formation in the process of decay of metastable vacua , as discussed by coleman and de luccia ( cdl ) in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this process in section 5 .    if the uplifting is relatively small , which may happen when we uplift a supersymmetric minkowski vacuum , or a shallow ads vacuum , as in the version of the kklt scenario developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , then the properties of the domain walls do not differ much form the properties of the bps walls prior to the uplifting . in this case",
    "we will be talking about near - bps , or near - extremal walls and bubbles .",
    "the concept of near - bps walls and bubbles is closely related to the concept of near - extremal black holes .",
    "whereas at the extremal limit the bps black holes are absolutely stable and have zero temperature , the near - extremal black holes have a non - vanishing temperature , they can evaporate and eventually approach a stable extremal limit . the physics of near - extremal black holes has been studied intensively over the years : a remarkable agreement with the physics of d - branes was established under condition of a small deviation from extremality @xcite .    in our new endeavor we will try to understand the rate of tunneling into a collapsing vacuum with a negative cosmological constant from uplifted slightly non - bps vacua using the proximity of the large size bubbles to the bps domain walls whose tension we can evaluate exactly . in the bps limit",
    "the corresponding bubbles have an infinite radius , but the near - bps ones have a large but finite radius @xcite .",
    "the description of these bubbles can be performed using the deviation from the bps limit as an expansion parameter .",
    "this simplifies investigation of bubble formation and vacuum decay in such models . in section 5",
    "we will find , in particular , that the vacuum decay rate of the uplifted supersymmetric minkowski vacuum does not depend on the details of the model and is given by the universal expression @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the entropy of the ds state .",
    "this decay rate is much higher than the typical rate of decay of a ds vacuum to a minkowski vacuum , which in many cases does not differ much from @xmath7 @xcite . in application to our vacuum with @xmath8",
    ", we are talking about the difference in the decay rate by a factor @xmath9 .",
    "the situation is especially interesting in a more general case when we uplift the models with several different ads minima of the moduli potential .",
    "the ads vacuum with a smaller value of the volume modulus experiences a bigger uplifting .",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking in the uplifted vacuum is related to the magnitude of the uplifting . as a result , the decay of the uplifted ads vacuum to the collapsing space with a negative vacuum energy usually occurs much faster than the typical ds rate of the uplifted minkowski vacuum @xmath10 . under some conditions",
    ", the decay rate can be quite large , with the suppression factor @xmath11 being replaced by @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 is the depth of the ads minimum prior to the uplifting , which may be a hundred orders of magnitude greater than @xmath8 . in the kklt - type models ,",
    "the depth of the ads vacuum prior to the uplifting is of the same order as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the gravitino mass after the uplifting @xcite .",
    "therefore in the class of models studied in section 5 , the vacuum decay rate due to the tunneling to a collapsing universe is related to the gravitino mass , @xmath17 .",
    "after the tunneling , the universe within each bubble with negative vacuum energy collapses within a microscopically small time @xmath18 .",
    "the condition that the lifetime of the uplifted vacuum is greater than the age of our part of the universe may serve as a vacuum superselection rule .",
    "an important feature of the decay of ds space to a minkowski vacuum or to a collapsing universe with a negative vacuum energy density is that the part of space that experiences such a decay never returns back to ds space .",
    "this is quite different from the back - and - forth transitions between various ds vacua , which may keep the system in a kind of thermal equilibrium . in this respect ,",
    "the channels of irreversible decay of an uplifted ds vacuum to a minkowski vacuum or to a collapsing universe serve as sinks for the probability flow in the landscape .",
    "in section 6 we will show that the existence of such sinks has important implications for the calculations of the probabilities in the landscape .",
    "in particular , if one ignores the different rate of expansion of the universe in different vacua , i.e. uses a comoving volume distribution , then in the absence of the sinks , the fraction of the comoving volume of the universe in the state with a given vacuum energy density @xmath19 asymptotically approaches @xmath20 .",
    "this distribution has a sharp maximum at the smallest possible @xmath21 .",
    "meanwhile if the vacuum with the smallest possible @xmath21 is not the ground state but a sink , and the probability of tunneling to the sink is sufficiently large , then the fraction of the volume in the vacuum with the smallest @xmath21 will be exponentially suppressed , and the maximum of the probability distribution will be at larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "walls and bubbles considered in our paper interpolate between domains with different values of the scalar fields , but with the same values of fluxes . in section 7",
    "we will briefly review our results and discuss a possibility of their generalization for the transitions between vacua with different fluxes .    1 cm",
    "in this paper we are going to analyze the domain wall solutions interpolating between different supersymmetric vacua of the landscape of string theory flux compactifications to 4 dimensions .",
    "we will focus on the case of @xmath3 supergravity .",
    "bps domain wall solutions with 1/2 of unbroken @xmath3 supersymmetry in the minimal 4-dimensional supergravity have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the equations presented there refer to the case of a single scalar field . here",
    "we are going to extend this analysis to a more general setup allowing for the possibility of many moduli fields with generic metric in the moduli space .",
    "of course , in any sufficiently small patch , there is a possible reparametrization of the moduli space so that there is a single scalar field supporting the domain wall . in a rather generic setup ,",
    "however , this is not possible globally , and therefore the equations we will propose in the following are more useful in this respect .",
    "the analysis presented here is mainly based on the approach presented in @xcite for the domain wall solutions of the minimal 5-dimensional supergravity .",
    "we briefly recall the main ingredients needed in order to discuss supersymmetric bosonic configurations of n=1 supergravity coupled to chiral multiplets .",
    "the bosonic sector of the action is @xmath22 where the potential can be expressed in terms of a superpotential @xmath23 as @xmath24 or , in terms of the covariantly holomorphic superpotential @xmath25 , as @xmath26 the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath27 on holomorphic quantities ( like @xmath28 ) and as @xmath29 on covariantly holomorphic quantities ( like @xmath30 ) .",
    "we will not consider vector multiplets and possible d - term extensions here .",
    "the relevant supersymmetry transformations ( of the gravitino and modulini ) are @xmath31 \\delta\\chi^{i}_{l } & = & \\frac12 \\gamma^{\\mu }   \\partial_{\\mu } z^{i}\\epsilon_{r } - \\frac12 g^{i\\bar\\jmath}{\\rm e}^{k/2 } \\overline{d_{j}w}\\epsilon_{l } , \\label{deltachi } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the @xmath33 khler connection .      in the following",
    "we will consider flat space - like domain wall solutions of the supersymmetry conditions and of the supergravity equations of motion .",
    "for this reason we are going to use the following metric ansatz @xmath34 given the domain wall structure , we split the indices @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "for the metric ( [ typei ] ) there is only one non - trivial component of the spin connection @xmath37 where @xmath38 , leading also to the ricci scalar ( which will become useful later ) @xmath39 . \\label{scalari}\\ ] ] plugging ( [ typei ] ) into the supersymmetry equations ( [ deltapsi])([deltachi ] ) and assuming that also the scalars @xmath40 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath41 , one obtains @xmath42 \\delta \\psi_{i l } & = & \\frac{a^\\prime}{2 } \\gamma_{\\underline i}\\gamma_{\\underline r } \\epsilon_l + \\frac12 { \\rm e}^{k/2 } w \\gamma_i \\epsilon_r \\label{delpsiii } \\\\[2 mm ] \\delta \\chi_l & = & \\frac12 \\gamma^r z^{i\\prime}(r ) \\epsilon_r - \\frac12 { \\rm e}^{k/2 } g^{i\\bar \\jmath } \\overline{d_j w } \\epsilon_l , \\label{delchii } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 was assumed . using also @xmath44 , one can start solving the various equations . from ( [ delpsiii ] ) , splitting the complex superpotential into norm and phase @xmath45 we get the projector condition @xmath46 from which the bps equation follows @xmath47 the condition ( [ proj0 ] ) can be assembled into a real projector @xmath48 ( satisfying @xmath49 ) acting on the full spinor as @xmath50 : @xmath51 . \\label{projectori}\\ ] ]    the radial equation on the gravitino gives a differential equation on the spinor parameter @xmath52 here , the projector condition was used .",
    "moreover , one can use the projector condition inside ( [ diffeps ] ) , or take the charge conjugate ( using the majorana condition ) .",
    "the two resulting equations are @xmath53 \\epsilon_r^{\\prime } & = & \\frac{i}{2}a_r^b \\epsilon_r \\pm \\frac12 { \\rm e}^{k/2 } |w| \\epsilon_r , \\label{majorana } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose consistency implies @xmath54    the solution is given in terms of an arbitrary constant left - handed spinor parameter @xmath55 ( hence the 1/2 supersymmetry preserved ) : @xmath56 the bps equation ( [ bpsi1 ] ) has been used to express the integration over the superpotential in terms of the warp factor and ( [ bpsextra ] ) for the integration over @xmath57 . in the last formula we have used the definition of the charged conjugate spinor @xmath58 that follows from choosing the charge conjugation matrix @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . in this way",
    "the spinor @xmath61 satisfies the relation ( [ proj0 ] ) .    finally , using again the projector condition in the modulini equations",
    ", one finds the bps equation for the scalar fields @xmath62 we can now also remove the dependence on the phase @xmath63 , by using the holomorphicity of the superpotential : @xmath64 this implies that the bps equations for the scalars can take the form : @xmath65 summarizing , the supersymmetry conditions that have to be satisfied in order to specify the domain wall solutions are @xmath66      z^{i \\prime } & = & \\mp 2 g^{i\\bar \\jmath }       \\partial_{\\bar \\jmath } |{\\cal z}| . \\end{array } $ } \\label{summary}\\ ] ] the other consistency condition we derived from the solution of the supersymmetry equations , namely ( [ bpsextra ] ) , is identically satisfied .",
    "this can be seen by using the fact that @xmath63 is the phase of the superpotential , and by equating with ( [ bpsextra ] ) the condition coming from its definition , @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting equation is an identity upon using ( [ summary ] ) .",
    "domain walls in @xmath3 supergravity were studied before in @xcite in a more restrictive setting , so we compare our results . first there is a change in the signature .",
    "this implies that one should change the sign for every upper index and put an @xmath68 for each gamma matrix in the supersymmetry equations .",
    "this can be re - absorbed in sending @xmath69 .",
    "then there is a difference in the metric . on the solution they have @xmath70 , but also their radial coordinate @xmath71 is related to ours by @xmath72 .",
    "also , the decomposition of the superpotential in norm and phase implies that @xmath73 .",
    "altogether the equations in @xcite become @xmath74 t^{\\prime } & = & -\\zeta { \\rm e}^{k/2+i \\theta } g^{t\\overline t } \\overline{d_t w } , \\label{cv2 } \\\\[2 mm ] \\theta^{\\prime } & = & \\frac{i}{2 } \\left(t^{\\prime }   \\partial_{t } k - \\overline t^{\\prime }   \\partial_{\\bar t } k\\right ) .",
    "\\label{cv3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that these equations are equivalent to the ones presented above , when restricted to a single scalar field flowing .",
    "we find it useful to present the domain wall equations in the form of renormalization group equations .",
    "for this purpose we will describe the flow not as a function of @xmath41 coordinate but as a function of the warp factor .",
    "we multiply eq .",
    "( [ bpsi2a ] ) on @xmath75 and find , using the eq .",
    "( [ bpsi1 ] ) @xmath76 and @xmath77 we will find below that in certain cases the domain wall bps equations in the form ( [ summary ] ) are useful . sometimes we will use equations in the form ( [ renorm1 ] ) , particularly in the case of many moduli participating in the flow and @xmath28 not crossing zero .",
    "a careful inspection of the bps conditions ( [ summary ] ) shows that we can associate to the domain wall solutions a monotonic function , which therefore specifies the direction of the flow .",
    "as it is known since the analysis of the 5-dimensional domain walls and the interpretation of such solutions as renormalization group flows in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , there is a c - function that is given by the first derivative of the logarithm of the warp factor @xmath78 @xcite . by using the bps equations we easily see that @xmath79 where the last inequality follows from the properties of the scalar metric",
    ".    there is , however , another interesting quantity that in most cases works as a c - function .",
    "this is the square of the covariantly holomorphic superpotential , which is related to the square of the mass of the gravitino at a generic point of the moduli space @xmath80 we can now look at the variations of @xmath81 along the flow . in order to compute it , we actually evaluate @xmath82 and use the bps equation ( [ bpsi2 ] ) .",
    "after some easy algebra we get that @xmath83 due to the positive definiteness of the metric of the scalar fields , this expression is clearly either always increasing , or always decreasing along the flow , depending on the sign of the bps equation , unless the flow crosses points where the superpotential vanishes .",
    "for these special cases the bps equations change sign as we cross the zeros of the superpotential and therefore @xmath81 is first decreasing until it reaches zero and then starts increasing again .      the supersymmetric domain walls studied above are static 1/2 bps configurations of @xmath84 supergravity . in an analogous situation for static 1/2 bps cosmic strings in n=1",
    "supergravity @xcite it was possible to rewrite the gravitational action , including the boundary terms , in the bps form .",
    "the action therefore was given by some squares of the bps conditions and total derivative terms .",
    "a saturation of the bps bound is equivalent to solving first order differential equations for unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "the on shell action therefore is equal , up to a sign , to the total energy of the string .",
    "therefore the tension of the string , the energy per unit area , can easily be derived from the bps action .",
    "the metric of the cosmic string is @xmath85 and the relation between the @xmath86 on shell and a tension @xmath87 is @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a fi term in the action .    for flat domain walls",
    "the metric is @xmath91 .",
    "therefore one would expect the following relation between the action and the tension ( the energy per unit of area ) @xmath92 in the case of cosmic strings @xmath93 and @xmath71 have flat metric , therefore the volume of the area is just @xmath94",
    ". however , for our domain walls we have to distinguish the physical volume from coordinate volume and we have to ignore ( divide by ) the physical volume which is @xmath95 .    in @xcite the tension of the bps domain walls was calculated using a rather complicated nester construction .",
    "the formula for the tension / energy density of the wall between two ads critical points is given for two cases : in one case the superpotential does not vanish between critical points , in the other case it vanishes at some intermediate point :    * 2 ads vacua , @xmath96 in between @xmath97 * 2 ads vacua , @xmath98 in between @xmath99    here we show that for domain walls we can put the supergravity action in the standard bps form , namely as the integral of the square of the bps conditions plus boundary terms .",
    "we start with the gravitational action supplemented by the gaussian curvature at the boundaries .",
    "@xmath100 here @xmath101 is the metric at the boundaries . in our case",
    "the boundaries are at @xmath102 surface",
    ". therefore @xmath103 and @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "one starts by plugging ( [ scalari ] ) in the einstein term and using that all the quantities depend only on the radial coordinate .",
    "then , we try to re - combine the various terms in the form of the bps equations ( [ bpsi1])([bpsi2a ] ) plus some boundary term .",

    "thus when @xmath115 does not vanish between fixed points and the bps equation of motion are satisfied with the upper sign the energy density of the wall is given by @xmath116 note that @xmath117 .",
    "so our answer is exactly as in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "it was explained in @xcite that the bps domain walls with this tension are related to cdl bubbles with infinite radius .",
    "now we assume that there is a solution of the bps equations where the superpotential vanishes at some point @xmath118 between the ads critical points .",
    "the boundary integral in eq .",
    "( [ bpsformi ] ) must be split into two terms since one part of the flow proceeds with one sign in the bps equations and for the other part , after @xmath119 point , the sign is flipped .",
    "therefore the answer for the energy density in this case is @xmath120 noting that @xmath117 , we have derived the correct tension as in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) in agreement with @xcite .",
    "this case , according to @xcite is not related to cdl tunneling .",
    "we would like to conclude this subsection by the observation that our new derivation of the bps domain wall tension follows the pattern discovered for the bps cosmic string in @xcite .",
    "we find the derivation using the bps form of the action significantly more elegant than using the nester construction .",
    "in this section we are going to give some examples of supersymmetric domain wall solutions for some of the generic models which capture the most important features of the landscape of flux vacua .",
    "we start with the simple scenario with just one khler modulus and all the complex structure moduli frozen : the kklt model @xcite .",
    "this model has one supersymmetric ads vacuum at a finite point of the volume modulus and a minkowski vacuum at infinite value of the volume modulus .",
    "we will solve the bps equations numerically and display the corresponding domain wall .",
    "after this simple example we show a more involved setup where also the complex structure moduli and the axion - dilaton are allowed to flow : the @xmath121 models .",
    "these include a wide variety of models ( and also the kklt model ) as a special case . the case which we will solve numerically has two different ads critical points at finite distance in the moduli space and three scalars are flowing between the critical points , two of them proportional to each other .",
    "finally we focus on a model where the effect of the khler deformations is neglected , but the form of the complex - structure deformations is more involved .",
    "the flux vacua in such models are described by a simple set of `` new attractor equations '' @xcite relating the points in the moduli space where the moduli are stabilized by fluxes .",
    "these flux vacua attractors have some resemblance as well as some differences with the black hole attractor equations @xcite .",
    "we will focus here on a model of a calabi ",
    "yau threefold obtained as a hypersurface in @xmath122 .",
    "this model has two different ads critical points @xcite at finite distance in the moduli space .",
    "we will find out how four scalars in this model are flowing from the landau ",
    "ginsburg ads critical point towards the near conifold region of the moduli space .",
    "the kklt model @xcite suggests a way to generate meta - stable de sitter vacua in string theory starting from supersymmetric anti de sitter minima with all moduli stabilized due to fluxes and using non - perturbative effects , such as gaugino condensation and/or d3-instantons .",

    "before uplifting , has one ads supersymmetric critical point at finite volume and an asymptotic minkowski vacuum at infinity of the volume .",

    "this example shows that the landscape attractors are different from the black - hole attractors . for the latter ,",
    "supersymmetry vacua are always minima of the superpotential @xmath28 and therefore one always has clear distinct basins of attractions and there are no repeller - like vacua . moreover ,",

    "these models are particularly relevant even for a single deformation parameter because of the results obtained in @xcite showing that , quite unexpectedly , the density of flux vacua is not uniform in moduli space , but rather it peaks around the conifold singularity , @xmath206 .",
    "indeed , upon extensive numerical computations , it has been shown that the conifold region plays the role of  attractor \" basin and it serves as accumulation region for flux vacua .",
    "this supports the analytic predictions made in @xcite . on the other hand , also the landau ",
    "ginzburg singularity at @xmath207 enjoys very peculiar properties , deriving from it being a fixed point of the modular group . in general",
    ", it is the special point in moduli space where the number of vacua with vanishing superpotential @xmath208 and discrete symmetries can be of the same order as the total number of vacua ( when non - zero ) @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", it will be convenient for computations because of our need to use perturbative expansions for the cy periods , that are known around this point @xcite .",
    "thus , in spite of neglecting the khler structure moduli that in principle would be present in these systems , this case is particularly interesting as a representative of the large amount of possible flux vacua that are making the landscape so rich .",
    "another important related feature is that one may encounter multiple attraction basins @xcite .",
    "these consist of distinct supersymmetric vacua that can be found within a finite region in moduli space , or `` area code '' , for fixed values of the @xmath209 and @xmath210 fluxes .",
    "we thus proceed to identify such a situation and to construct the domain wall solution interpolating between different area codes . as a start",

    "the probability distribution @xmath439 coincides with the square of the hartle  hawking wave function describing the ground state of the universe @xcite .",
    "it has a simple physical meaning : the universe wants to be in the ground state @xmath308 with the lowest possible value of @xmath440 , and the probability of the deviations from the ground state is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this probability distribution also has a nice thermodynamic interpretation in terms of ds entropy @xmath441 @xcite : @xmath442 here , as before , @xmath443 .",
    "this result and its thermodynamic interpretation played a substantial role in the discussion of the string theory landscape @xcite .    unfortunately , there are some problems associated with this result .",
    "it suggests that the universe is similar to a pond filled with still water , where all things accumulate at the bottom : the fraction of the comoving volume with the smallest possible vacuum energy must be overwhelmingly large , @xmath444 . for a discussion of paradoxes associated with this conclusion and their possible resolution in the kklt scenario see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "investigation of the stationary probability distribution alone does not give us a full picture .",
    "for example , the probability distribution ( [ e38a ] ) tells us about the fraction of the comoving volume of the universe in a given state , but it tells us nothing about the evolution towards this state . a partial answer to this question",
    "can be given by investigation of the stochastic diffusion equations describing the evolution of the scalar field in the inflationary universe .",
    "but now , instead of looking for the most probable outcome of the evolution , one should follow the evolution backwards and look for the initial condition @xmath308 for the trajectories which bring the field to its final destination @xmath130 . in the stationary regime",
    "considered above , the corresponding solution looks very similar to ( [ e38a ] ) @xcite : @xmath445 in this equation , however , @xmath308 is not the position of the ground state , but a position of an arbitrary initial point for the diffusion process which eventually brings us to the point @xmath130 . as we see",
    ", the probability is maximized by the largest possible value of @xmath446 .",
    "interestingly , expression @xmath447 describing the probability of initial conditions coincides with the expression for the square of the tunneling wave function describing creation of a closed ds universe `` from nothing '' @xcite , whereas the second term looks like the square of the hartle - hawking wave function describing the ground state of the universe . in the stationary regime",
    "the squares of these two wave functions coexist in the same equation , but they provide answers to different questions .    here",
    "we should note that it is far from being clear whether the simplest probability distribution which we studied so far should be used in anthropic considerations .",
    "indeed , the probability that something happen at a given _ point _ , which is described by the probability distribution in the _ comoving volume _ as discussed above , does not take into account the exponential growth of the _ physical volume _ of the universe , which is the main property of inflationary models .",
    "for the discussion of the volume - weighted probability measure , see e.g. @xcite .    despite this reservation , it is quite important to study the probability distribution in the comoving volume since its investigation is an essential step in several different attempts to calculate the probabilities in the landscape .",
    "here we would like to discuss another problem with the stationary probability distribution described above : this stationary distribution is not very useful during inflation when one can ignore the existence of the lowest ds space with @xmath335 ; in order to obtain a stationary distribution one should take into account the growth of the physical volume of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we are going to show now , this distribution does not necessarily apply to the string theory landscape , simply because in the kklt scenario there are no stable ds vacua that could serve as a ground state of the universe .",
    "metastability of ds space in the kklt construction was emphasized in @xcite and in many subsequent papers .",
    "here we would like to look at this issue in a more detailed way .",
    "stationarity of the probability distribution ( [ weinb2 ] ) was achieved because the lowest ds state did not have any further way to fall .",
    "meanwhile , in string theory it is always possible for the metastable ds state to decay .",
    "it is important that if it decays by production of the bubbles of 10d minkowski space @xcite , or by production of bubbles containing a collapsing open universe with a negative cosmological constant @xcite , the standard mechanism of return back to the original ds state does not operate any longer .",
    "these processes work like sinks for the flow of probability in the landscape .",
    "the fraction of the comoving volume in ds vacua will decrease in time .    to get a visual understanding of this process ,",
    "assume that we are looking at the universe in the comoving coordinates , and paint black all of its parts corresponding to one of the two ds states , and paint white the parts in another ds state .",
    "then the stationary regime which we discussed so far would imply that eventually the whole universe in average becomes gray , and the level of gray asymptotically will remain constant .",
    "suppose now that some parts of the universe may tunnel to a state with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "these parts will collapse , so they will not return to the initial ds vacua .",
    "if we paint such parts red , then the universe , instead of reaching the constant gray level , eventually will look completely red .",
    "this does not mean that eventually all parts of our universe will end up in the sink .",
    "due to the exponential expansion of the universe in various ds vacua , the universe eternally rejuvenates , and the total volume of the universe in different ds states continues to grow exponentially @xcite .",
    "however , if one wants to find the ratio of the comoving volume of the universe in different states , then instead of solving the detailed balance equation ( [ balance ] ) , one should solve the `` vacuum dynamics '' equations @xmath448 @xmath449 here @xmath450 is the probability current from the lower ds vacuum to the sink , i.e. to a collapsing universe , or to a minkowski vacuum , @xmath451 is the probability current from the upper ds vacuum to the sink , @xmath452 is the probability current from the lower ds vacuum to the upper ds vacuum , and @xmath453 is the probability current from the upper ds vacuum to the lower ds vacuum . combining this all together , gives us the following set of equations for the probability distributions : @xmath454 @xmath455 since the entropy is inversely proportional to the energy density , the entropy of the lower level is higher , @xmath456 .",
    "since the tunneling is exponentially suppressed , we have @xmath457 , so we have a hierarchy @xmath458 .",
    "we will associate the lower vacuum with our present vacuum state , with @xmath459 , and therefore in what follows we will often have in mind the regime @xmath460 .    for simplicity",
    ", we will study here the possibility that only the lower vacuum can tunnel to the sink , i.e. we will take the limit @xmath461 and drop the term @xmath462 in eq .",
    ". we will analyze more general solutions of equations ( [ v1 ] ) , ( [ v2 ] ) in a separate publication @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we will keep in mind the results of the previous section , where we have found that typically the probability of the decay of a metastable ds vacuum to a sink can be quite high , @xmath463 .",
    "therefore we expect that @xmath464",
    ". other mechanisms of a relatively fast vacuum decay have been discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions to be obtained in this section will be valid for any of these mechanisms .    by solving equations ( [ v1 ] ) , ( [ v2 ] )",
    ", one can show that @xmath465 and @xmath466 exponentially decrease in the course of time due to the existence of the sink ( the term @xmath467 ) , but the corresponding physical volume of the universe exponentially grows , and the ratio @xmath468 approaches a stationary regime @xmath469 . in order to find @xmath470 , one can add to each other our equations ( without the term @xmath471 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath472 the solution is @xmath473    as for the ( asymptotically ) constant ratio @xmath474 , from eqs .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) , ( [ v3 ] ) one finds @xmath475    one may consider two interesting regimes .",
    "suppose first that @xmath476 , i.e. the probability to fall to the sink from the lower vacuum is smaller than the probability of the decay of the upper vacuum . in this case one",
    "recovers the previous result , eq .",
    "( [ weinb2 ] ) , which is related to the square of the hartle - hawking wave function : @xmath477    now let us consider an opposite regime , and assume that the decay rate of the uplifted ds vacuum to the sink is relatively large , @xmath478 ( which automatically means that @xmath479 ) . in this case the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) is @xmath480 i.e. one has an inverted probability distribution .",
    "this result has a simple interpretation : if the `` thermal exchange '' between the two ds vacua occurs very slowly as compared to the rate of the decay of the lower ds vacuum , then the main fraction of the volume of the ds vacua will be in the state with higher energy density .",
    "note that the total fraction of the comoving volume remaining in both of the ds spaces exponentially decreases in time due to the existence of the sink in the lower ds vacuum : @xmath481 this result may have interesting methodological implications .",
    "in many recent discussions of the probabilities in the landscape the authors consider the world as seen by an imaginary eternal observer . in the context of the stringy landscape",
    "such considerations are problematic , because every would - be eternal observer living in the landscape ( unlike an observer in an eternally existing ds space ) begins his life in a cosmological singularity and ends up in a sink , within the typical time determined by eq .",
    "( [ sinkpower ] ) . moreover , if the sinks occur in the higher ds vacua ( see below ) , then the `` eternal observers '' , or markers , will have a good chance to die well before reaching the thermalized regions produced after inflation .",
    "introduction of a finite lifetime of such observers may result in the modification of the probability measure as suggested in @xcite .    here",
    "we should make an important clarification .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath431 describes the fraction of the volume of the universe in a particular ds state .",
    "however , when the bubbles of a new phase expand , their interior becomes an empty ds space .",
    "if we are usual observers which are born after reheating of the universe , then one may argue that the probability _ to live _ in the bubble @xmath482 is proportional not to the relative volume of the bubbles @xmath483 but to the frequency of their production , i.e. to the ratio of the probability currents @xmath484 @xcite . in the absence of the sink ,",
    "the fraction of the comoving volume which flows to the lower ds vacuum due to the tunneling from the upper ds vacuum is equal to the fraction of the volume jumping upwards from the lowest vacuum to the higher vacuum .",
    "in other words , the two probability currents are exactly equal to each other , j_01 = j_10  , which is the essence of the detailed balance equation ( [ balance ] ) .",
    "interestingly , our new results imply that this regime remains approximately valid even in the presence of the sink , under the condition @xmath485 .    on the other hand , in the regime described by eq .",
    "( [ ooo ] ) , which occurs if the decay rate to the sink is large enough , @xmath486 , one has a completely different result : @xmath487 thus we have a crucial regime change at the moment when the decay rate of the lower vacuum to the sink starts competing with the decay rate of the upper ds vacuum .",
    "now we will compare the probability current to the sink , @xmath488 , and the probability current from the lower ds upwards , @xmath489 . in the absence of the sink",
    ", @xmath488 was zero , so every point falling to the lower ds vacuum eventually jumps up to the higher ds vacua .",
    "this leads to eternal recycling of ds vacua @xcite , and to the problems discussed in @xcite : in the absence of the sinks ( i.e. in the models with eternal ds space ) each point in the comoving volume would indefinitely wonder between different ds spaces . in this scenario , it would be more probable that our part of the universe was formed as a result of a large quantum fluctuation upwards from an empty ds space , instead of being formed at the stage of inflation .",
    "this would leave the homogeneity of our universe , and the origin of perturbations of metric unexplained @xcite .",
    "invention of the kklt mechanism demonstrated that all ds vacua in string theory are metastable @xcite , with the lifetime smaller than the recurrence time @xmath490 .",
    "this means that we do not have much time for the incredibly improbable jumps upwards to happen @xcite .",
    "however , the time necessary for the improbable fluctuations upwards , which could re - create conditions for the existence of life , is also somewhat smaller than the recurrence time @xcite .",
    "therefore in order to make sure that the universe does not recycle back from our ds state we would need to double - check that the probability to jump upwards is indeed strongly suppressed as compared to the probability to tunnel to the sink .",
    "the estimates of the decay probability of ds vacuum contained in our paper confirm that this is indeed the case . indeed ,",
    "investigation of the tunneling in several models discussed in our paper suggests that the probability that any given part of ds space with @xmath491 will jump upwards and participate in the process of recycling of the universe is suppressed by a factor of @xmath492 .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the probability current from the lower ds vacuum to the upper vacuum @xmath489 with the probability current from the lower ds vacuum to the sink @xmath488 : @xmath493 the last part of this equation follows from the condition @xmath460 , and from the estimate of the decay rate obtained in the previous section , which suggests that in many cases this rate is quite high , @xmath464 .",
    "despite this fact , recycling may still be possible , since for @xmath485 one has @xmath494 . on the other hand , for @xmath486 one has @xmath495 .",
    "this suggests that in this regime the probability that our universe was created due to the jumps up @xcite becomes exponentially small as compared with the probability that it was formed as a result of inflation . using our results",
    ", one can easily check that this is indeed the case if the rate of spontaneous formation of the parts of the universe of our type in the vacuum @xmath496 is smaller than the decay rate of the vacuum @xmath496 to the sink . for wide sinks",
    ", this condition can be easily satisfied .",
    "this conclusion is closely related to the inversion of the probability distribution for @xmath486 ( wide sink regime ) , see eq .",
    "( [ ooo ] ) .",
    "note that inverted probability distributions in the presence of the sink represented by minkowski vacuum naturally appear in the simplest chaotic inflation scenario with the volume - weighted probability measures proposed in @xcite ; see figs . 10 and 12 in @xcite , where the basic theory of the volume - weighted distributions in the inflationary cosmology was developed . with the first of the two volume - weighted probability measures proposed in @xcite the problem of non - inflationary jumps up does not appear at all ; the growth of the total volume of the universe ( and the corresponding fluxes ) is predominantly determined by the exponential expansion of domains with larger vacuum energy and by the subsequent inflation on the way down .",
    "in our investigation so far we considered the simplest model with two ds vacua , with the probability leak in the lower ds vacuum . on the other hand ,",
    "if the probability leak occurs only in the upper ds vacuum , one may ignore the term @xmath497 in eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) but keep the term @xmath498 in eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", for @xmath499 one again recovers the distribution ( [ hheq ] ) , whereas for @xmath500 one finds @xmath501 note that in this regime we have a flat probability distribution , which does not depend on @xmath502 .",
    "more generally , one should consider a dynamical equilibrium of a system of many ds , minkowski and ads vacua , where the probability leaks may occur at each level .",
    "the fraction of the comoving volume occupied by different metastable vacua in such a universe will be exponentially sensitive to the decay modes for each of these vacua .",
    "this makes the investigation of the probabilities in the landscape much more involved , but also much more interesting .",
    "previously we were trying to construct the wave function of the ground state of the universe .",
    "now we should learn how to study the universe with the holes in the ground .",
    "there are two possible approaches to string theory landscape .",
    "the first one is based on the calculation of the wave function of the universe , which may describe all branches of the wave function corresponding to all possible vacua . in fact , the first two proposals for the anthropic solution of the cosmological problem in the context of inflationary cosmology were based on the investigation of quantum creation of the universe with various values of scalar fields and fluxes @xcite , or with different types of compactification @xcite .",
    "another approach is to consider an inflationary universe consisting of many parts corresponding to all possible vacua @xcite , which allows , in particular , to consider a single universe divided into parts corresponding to all possible values of scalar fields , fluxes and compactifications , and look for the anthropic solution of the cosmological constant problem in this context , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "conceptually , this approach is much simpler than the approach based on quantum cosmology , but in order to make it sufficiently general one must find a way to describe the universe consisting of many different parts and describe possible transitions between them .",
    "this was the goal of our paper .",
    "one of the problems here is that a fully consistent `` landscape action '' with the bulk and brane sources is not known @xcite .",
    "however , one can hope that such action can be constructed at least in the case of unbroken supersymmetry following the `` supersymmetry in singular spaces '' proposal @xcite .",
    "this strategy was already applied in examples of fully consistent supersymmetric bulk and brane actions in @xcite which include the d8 domain walls with the piece - wise constant @xmath503 flux . in a more general situation with moduli stabilization when various fluxes may jump due to brane sources , the corresponding construction has still to be developed .",
    "therefore in the current project we restricted ourselves to studies of the regions of the landscape where stabilization of the moduli is under control and fluxes are fixed . even in this restricted and simplified situation",
    "we were able to find multiple vacua and bps domain walls separating them .",
    "in the first part of this paper we concentrated on the stringy landscape prior to the uplifting and found many bps domain wall solutions separating different parts of the stringy landscape from each other .",
    "we did it using the methods developed earlier in @xcite , and also more recent methods based on the `` new attractor equations '' @xcite .    in the second part of the paper we studied what happens with the domain walls after the uplifting . in general , potentials of many moduli before and",
    "after uplifting may have many different ads minima of the moduli potential , for the same values of fluxes . before the uplifting ,",
    "the tunneling between these minima was forbidden by supersymmetry .",
    "one could expect , therefore , that after the uplifting the rate of tunneling may be related to the degree of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , in the particular examples that we have studied the probability of the decay of the uplifted vacuum to the remaining ads vacuum was suppressed by a factor @xmath504 , where @xmath505 is the gravitino mass .",
    "this decay probability is much greater than @xmath506 .",
    "one of the interesting features of the decay of ds vacua to minkowski or ads vacua is that this decay is irreversible .",
    "this process is substantially different from the stationary `` thermal exchange '' between various ds vacua .",
    "the existence of the channels of the irreversible vacuum decay , which serve as sinks for the flow of probability , is a distinguishing new feature of the stringy landscape which deserves further investigation .",
    "as we show in section 6 of our paper , the existence of the sinks strongly affects the probability distributions in string cosmology .",
