    "there has been considerable effort in trying to understand the forces between quarks in terms of strings and several models have been proposed with different degrees of success .",
    "the nambu - goto model [ 1 ] , which is a direct generalization of the covariant action for a relativistic point particle moving in space - time , describes the evolution of a string . when this string evolves sweeps out a two - dimensional world sheet surface embedded in a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the area of this surface is precisely the nambu - goto action .",
    "close to this are the generalized eguchi models [ 2 ] of which schild s [ 3 ] is a particular case .",
    "the functional - integral quantization of these models has been studied by lscher , symanzik and weisz [ 4 ] and by alvarez [ 5 ] who calculated the static potential in the large - d limit , where d is the number of dimensions of the embedding space .",
    "the result obtained by alvarez turned out to be correct for any d as shown latter by arviz [ 6 ] .",
    "the nambu - goto string model gives qualitatively encouraging results as a large - n qcd string i.e. , the interquark potential is linear for large distances which is understood as a signal of confinement , it also has linear regge trajectories and presents a transition to a deconfined phase with vanishing string tension at certain temperature [ 7 ] .",
    "quantitatively , however , this model is not in very good shape with numerical values closer to those obtained in monte carlo simulations of an su(2 ) lattice gauge theory rather than su(3 ) [ 8 ] .",
    "also it has been shown [ 9 ] that agreement of the nambu - goto string with a calculation of the high - temperature partition function of a qcd flux tube would require an infinite number of massive world - sheet degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the model has been modified by populating the string with scalar an fermi fields improving some of the quantitative results [ 10 ] .",
    "however the prize to pay is too high since the conformal invariance of the theory is explicitly broken [ 11 ] .",
    "it seems that the nambu - goto string or naive modifications of it will not give us the qcd string .",
    "still the nambu - goto model remains very useful as the simplest string model where some calculations can be done without undue effort and mathematical methods as well as new physical ideas can be tested .",
    "more elaborated extensions of nambu - goto have incorporated an extrinsic curvature term in the action ( the so - called rigid or polyakov - kleinert string [ 12 ] ) and several properties of interest have been investigated [ 13 ] .",
    "rigid strings coupled to long range kalb - ramond fields have been also studied [ 14 ] , and more recently `` confining strings '' [ 15 ] seem to be very promising models for the qcd string . in all of these models one important problem is to determine the potential between two sources i.e. , the so called interquark static potential .",
    "this potential has been calculated by various perturbative and non - perturbative methods .",
    "the common feature has been , however , the assumption of infinitely massive quarks at the ends of the string which is equivalent to impossing fixed ends boundary conditions . in a recent series of papers",
    "a consistent method has been proposed to study the effects of finite point masses attached to the ends of the string [ 16 ] .",
    "in particular a variational estimation of the nambu - goto string potential has been worked out although with some simplifying assumptions[17 ] . here",
    "we reconsider this problem and present the solutions to the gap equations and determine the interquark potential as well as other quantities of interest exactly .",
    "we also provide a discussion of lscher term and argue that it remains universal with no mass contributions coming from the point particles attached to the ends of the string . in section ii we present the model and equations for the lagrange multipliers and metric components .",
    "we also obtain a very simple looking formula for the interquark potential .",
    "the numerical analysis of the equations and various quantities of interest is carried out in section iii .",
    "we also compare with the approximated results of [ 17 ] .",
    "finally section iv comprises a discussion of lscher term and argue that it remains universal .",
    "we conclude with a brief account of our results .",
    "at the quantum level the nambu - goto model is given by the following functional integral @xmath0 e^{-s},\\ ] ] in euclidean space , the action s is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the string tension , @xmath3 are the world trajectories of the string massive ends and @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric @xmath5 the @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the string coordinates and @xmath8 is the embedding euclidean metric of the space where the string evolves , @xmath9 is thus the induced metric on the world sheet swept out by the string .",
    "to study the model further it is convenient to specify a gauge , we choose the `` physical gauge '' or monge parametrization @xmath10 where the @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the @xmath13 transverse oscillations of the string .",
    "we further introduce composite fields @xmath14 given by @xmath15 the metric @xmath16 and string coordinates @xmath17 become independent fields by introducing eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) as a constraint .",
    "this requires the use of lagrange multipliers @xmath18 which also become independent variables .",
    "the functional integral eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) then becomes @xmath19[d\\alpha][d\\sigma ] e^{-s(\\vec{u},\\alpha,\\sigma)},\\ ] ] where the action eq .",
    "( 2.2 ) is now given by @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\sum_{a=1}^2 m_a\\int dt\\sqrt{1+\\dot{\\vec{u}^2}(t , r_a ) } \\qquad r_1=0 , \\qquad r_2=r.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it has been shown by alvarez that , at the saddle point , the lagrange parameters @xmath18 as well as the metric components @xmath14 become symmetric constant matrices with no dependence on @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ". thus while @xmath23 is in general a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath24 becomes , at the saddle point , a constant .",
    "this fact simplifies the problem considerably .",
    "since the action is quadratic in the string oscillations @xmath25 we can do the gaussian integral inmediately . the resulting action , in the particular case where @xmath26 , can be written as @xmath27 + 2m\\beta.\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is related to the casimir energy @xmath29 as follows @xmath30 and the last term in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) is the contribution to the action due to the point masses at the ends of the string .",
    "this term can be set to zero with an appropriate redefinition of @xmath31 .",
    "thus we ignore this term in what follows .",
    "the casimir energy @xmath32 depends on the eigenmomenta @xmath33 which on its turn depend on the boundary conditions imposed on the system . for a string with infinitely heavy quarks attached to its ends",
    "we impose fixed ends boundary conditions , in this case @xmath34 and the casimir energy is @xmath35 where the last term was obtained by the use of riemann s @xmath36-function i.e. , @xmath37_{\\nu=-1}=\\zeta ( -1)=-\\frac{1}{12}.$ ] in the case of finite quark masses the problem becomes increasingly difficult to dealt with even when @xmath38 . it can be shown that in this case @xmath39 the casimir energy is given by [ 17 ] @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dimensionless quantities corresponding to the ( extrinsic ) length and point masses attached to the ends of the string , respectively . the equation for @xmath28 eq .",

    "thus when writing the equations for the lagrange multipliers and metric components derivatives of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath46 should appear .",
    "these are given by    [ 2.18 ] @xmath49    where , in eq .",
    "( 2.18a ) , @xmath50 has been replaced by @xmath51 the potential @xmath52 is obtained in the usual way @xmath53 , @xmath54 and is given by the simple looking formula @xmath55 which follows from eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) and the gap equations ( 2.18 ) .",
    "the potential @xmath56 is also a dimensionless quantity , @xmath57 .",
    "of course there is no way to solve eqs .",
    "( 2.18 ) analytically thus eq .",
    "( 2.20 ) is only a formal expression for @xmath56 .",
    "one can play with eqs .",
    "( 2.18 ) and write down an expression for @xmath46 @xmath58 which will be useful for discussing some limiting situations in the last section .",
    "for the numerical analysis of the problem it is more convenient to write eqs .",
    "( 2.18 ) in the form    [ 3.1 ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 @xmath61 combining eqs .  ( 3.1a ) and ( 3.1b ) we get @xmath62 or @xmath63 where @xmath64 we can now solve eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) in terms of @xmath65    [ 3.7 ] @xmath66    thus at the end everything depends now on @xmath48 and @xmath67 . from eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) we can recover the @xmath68-dependence .",
    "in figures @xmath69 to @xmath70 we have the behavior of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 as functions of @xmath48 for various values of the mass parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we see in fig.1 that @xmath75 presents a maximum for @xmath76 , at this point @xmath77 vanishes and the problem can be solved exactly .",
    "this point corresponds to the maximum value of the casimir energy eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) for a given length @xmath68 . in this point @xmath78 and from eq .  ( 3.5 ) @xmath79 .",
    "thus the solution to the gap equations is    [ 3.8 ] @xmath80    from eqs .",

    "( 3.11 ) implies that there is a minimum value of @xmath67 for which the potential exists at @xmath85 , denoting this value by @xmath86 we see that it is given by @xmath87 the general solution of the problem is given by eqs .",
    "( 3.5 ) and ( 3.7 ) .",
    "fig.4 shows the behaviour of @xmath46 , @xmath88 , @xmath47 and @xmath89 as functions of @xmath68 for various values of the mass parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we see that for large @xmath68 , @xmath46 and @xmath88 tend to one while @xmath47 and @xmath89 approach zero . thus from eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) we see that for finite @xmath67 large-@xmath68 is equivalent to large-@xmath48 , this will be of interest when discussing lscher term in the following section . in fig.5",
    "we show the behaviour of the potential @xmath56 for several values of the mass @xmath67 .",
    "we see that for big and small values of @xmath67 the curves come close together in agreement with eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) approaching the nambu - goto result for @xmath90 .",
    "we also see that the small bump in fig.2 of [ 17 ] for @xmath91 is not present .",
    "this being probably a numerical artefact .",
    "we next show in fig.6 the so called deconfinement radious @xmath92 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath68 for which the potential vanishes and probably signals the presence of the tachyon in string models . comparing with fig.3 of [ 17 ]",
    "we see that the behaviour is very similar avoiding , however , the numerical trick of [ 17 ] at @xmath93 .",
    "we have obtained exact results to the problem of quark mass corrections to the string potential for the nambu - goto model in the case where the masses attached to the ends of the string are equal .",
    "these results are similar to those presented by lambiase and nesterenko [ 17 ] obtained under some symplifying assumptions .",
    "there is , however , a subtle point concerning the lscher term which we would like to discuss . for a string with fixed ends",
    "lscher term has a contribution to the potential of the form @xmath94 the importance of this term is that it is universal i.e. , independent of the details of a whole class of models , in particular , independent of the parameters of the model under consideration . in the one - loop approximation to the problem discussed above the potential",
    "becomes @xmath95 where @xmath32 is given by @xmath96 and @xmath32 depends on the mass @xmath67 through @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) ) thus apparently giving lscher term a mass dependence .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that this coulomb - like term arises as a long distance ( large-@xmath68 ) effect .",
    "thus strictly speaking corrections to lscher term , if any , should be obtained after expanding eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) for large @xmath68 . from our numerical results we can see that large-@xmath68 is equivalent to large-@xmath48 for a given finite value of @xmath67 .",
    "thus for large @xmath68 , @xmath46 and @xmath88 are essentially one and from eqs .",
    "( 2.20 ) and ( 2.21 ) the potential becomes @xmath97 for large - s we can approximate the integral involved in the definition of @xmath28 eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) with the result @xmath98 thus the potential becomes @xmath99 leaving lscher term universal .    in conclusion",
    "the study of the interquark potential for string models with masses attached to its ends is of undoubted interest by itself as a mathematical problem and certainly for the possible physical applications to the low energy regime of qcd .",
    "here we have presented exact solutions to the gap equations and the interquark potential has been obtained for several values of @xmath67 .",
    "we see that having finite point masses at the ends of the string has considerable effects on the potential . also the deconfinement radious become a function of @xmath67 and its value could be fixed phenomenologically .",
    "we also discuss the universality of lscher term and argue that it remains universal if we understand it strictly as a long distance effect with mass corrections coming up at higher orders in @xmath100 .",
    "finally the tachyon problem of string theories remains unresolved although recently [ 18 ] there has been some discussion on how one can possibly avoid it .",
    "fig.1 + we show @xmath101 as a function of log(s ) eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) which essentially defines the casimir energy eq .",
    "for @xmath90 the quantity s given by eq .",

    "this value coincide with the one obtained for a string with fixed ends boundary conditions .",
