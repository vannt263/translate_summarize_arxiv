    "optical parametric oscillators are one of the most interesting and well characterized devices in nonlinear quantum optics .",
    "novel discoveries made with them include demonstrations of large amounts of squeezing@xcite , significant quantum intensity correlations@xcite together with a quadrature correlation measurement that provided the first experimental demonstration @xcite of the original epr paradox .",
    "practical applications include their use as highly efficient and tunable frequency converters . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the optimum below - threshold squeezing results , which determine the limits to squeezing obtained near the critical point , where nonlinear corrections start to dominate . in a companion paper@xcite",
    ", the related question of critical fluctuations at threshold is treated .",
    "the theory of quantum squeezing in the linear parametric oscillator is now well - developed@xcite-@xcite .",
    "excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained@xcite-@xcite , in the region below threshold .",
    "however , the usual theory is linearized , and therefore can not be used in the near - threshold region where the squeezing is largest .",
    "the drawback with linearized theories is that they predict that zero quantum noise levels are achievable at threshold .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic , since ( by the heisenberg uncertainty principle ) it necessarily requires an infinite energy in the conjugate mode .",
    "more significantly , this would imply an infinite amount of phase information - which is also impossible , since the coherent pump which drives the parametric oscillator can only supply a finite quantity of phase information .",
    "while present experiments are limited by technical noise from approaching the critical point too closely , it is reasonable to expect that progress in integrated optics will lead to more stable , highly miniaturized devices which could well operate at the quantum limit , even near threshold .",
    "accordingly , there have been a number of investigations as to the ultimate limits to the squeezing spectrum of a parametric amplifier / oscillator .",
    "this has often involved using keldysh diagrams or wyld - keldysh techniques @xcite-@xcite to extend the linear theory @xcite-@xcite , using a many - body theory analog of feynman diagrams .",
    "the two - mode hilbert space involved in these problems typically has a minimum dimension @xmath0 , even with only @xmath1 photons , and therefore would be difficult to solve using other methods that involve number - state expansions - either using a direct solution of the master equation , or stochastic wave - function methods .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix would have @xmath2 coefficients , unless simplified , with a density matrix of similar size .",
    "more typical experimental photon numbers have at least @xmath3 , with a corresponding density matrix dimension of @xmath4 - which appears completely inaccessible with number state techniques .",
    "another drawback of number - state techniques is that they usually do not permit analytic approximations , which can give more physical insight .",
    "we therefore treat these questions using the coherent - state positive p - representation @xcite , combined with an expansion technique valid below the critical point .",
    "results are also verified by the use of direct numerical stochastic equation simulations .",
    "we find an @xmath5 scaling law for the optimal squeezing predicted by plimak and walls@xcite is obtained here as well , but with a different spectrum , owing to the use of more systematic expansion techniques that result from using the positive p - representation method .",
    "our analytic results for optimal squeezing , which occurs below the critical threshold , give excellent agreement with accurate numerical simulations for the same parameter values .",
    "however , even larger noise reductions are predicted to occur simply by reducing the losses of the second - harmonic , in which case the @xmath5 scaling law no longer holds . in a companion paper",
    "we consider the related problem of the critical region , where the narrow - band squeezing is less than optimal due to the effects of critical fluctuations .",
    "we also compare the above results with a semiclassical approach , that is , a truncated wigner phase - space equation .",
    "this equation corresponds to a classical theory with added vacuum fluctuations . a comparison between the positive p - representation ( fully quantum mechanical ) and semiclassical theories permits us to see how far one can go and what is the limitation of this extended classical point of view .",
    "we find that the nonlinear corrections in the semiclassical theory are in strong disagreement with the full quantum theory far below threshold , but agree near threshold .",
    "this tells us that the semiclassical theory works surprisingly well in the threshold region , indicating that the large quantum fluctuations near threshold have a rather classical character .",
    "the model considered here is the degenerate parametric oscillator .",
    "the system of interest is an idealized interferometer , which is resonant at two frequencies , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is externally driven at the larger of the two frequencies .",
    "both frequencies are damped due to cavity losses .",
    "down conversion of the pump photons to resonant sub - harmonic mode photons occurs due to a @xmath8 nonlinearity present inside the cavity .",
    "the heisenberg picture hamiltonian that describes this open system@xcite is @xmath9 where the intra - cavity or system hamiltonian is given by : @xmath10    here @xmath11 represents the external driving field at frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the term @xmath13 describes the free evolution of the extra - cavity modes that are the loss - reservoirs of the cavity .",
    "the term @xmath14 is the coupling parameter due to a @xmath8 nonlinear medium internal to the cavity , and @xmath15 are reservoir operators that create and destroy photons in the loss - reservoir coupled to the internal mode of frequency @xmath16 .",
    "next , we wish to consider an interaction picture , obtained with the definition that @xmath17 in other words , the operators will evolve according to the relevant mode frequency , while the states evolve according to the rest of the system hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian used here then reduces to the the standard one@xcite for a non - degenerate , single - mode parametric amplifier or oscillator : @xmath18 + \\frac{i\\chi } { 2}\\left [ \\widehat{a}_{2}\\widehat{a}_{1}^{\\dagger2 } -\\widehat{a}_{2}^{\\dagger } \\widehat{a}_{1}^{2}\\right ] \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath19 are now time - independent operators representing the fundamental and second - harmonic modes respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen the field mode - functions so that @xmath11 , @xmath14 are real .",

    ", we will assume that @xmath27 , and similarly for the fundamental mode - which will be assumed to only decay through its output coupling mirror . if these conditions are not satisfied , then the coupling efficiency and maximum squeezing are reduced .",

    "they are obtained by the use of a classical decorrelation in which all operator products are assumed to factorize , so that @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the solution of these equations is immediate classically , and has the property that there is a phase transition at the critical driving field of : @xmath32 . for driving fields below this value ,",

    "classically , there are only second - harmonic photons present at this driving field , and the input photon flux is @xmath37",
    ". however , a squeezed field - with finite intensity - is actually emitted as well .",
    "this is not taken into account in the classical theory .",
    "in order to treat the full quantum evolution , we now turn to the methods of operator representation theory .",
    "these techniques can be used to transform the density matrix equations of motion to c - number fokker - planck or stochastic equations .      in the positive p - representation ,",
    "the density matrix is expanded in terms of multi - mode coherent state vectors @xmath38 : @xmath39    following standard procedures , the assumption of vanishing boundary terms allows the master equation to be re - written as a fokker - planck equation in @xmath40 and hence as a stochastic equation@xcite with real noise .",
    "the assumption of vanishing boundary terms is critical to this procedure , and we note here that this is generally valid when the ratio of nonlinearity to damping is small@xcite , ( i.e. @xmath41 ) .",
    "the stochastic procedure is best regarded as being generally an asymptotic procedure , valid for small @xmath42 - in which case the boundary terms are exponentially suppressed .",

    "the main difference between the two sets of equations is the noise terms . in the semiclassical theory",
    "the noise is universal for all modes and comes from to the vacuum fluctuations , while in the positive - p equation the pump has a noiseless amplitude and the signal noise comes from the nonlinear coupling .",
    "however , we note that the wigner equation after truncation is no longer completely equivalent to quantum mechanics , since it always leads to a positive wigner function - thus , not all quantum states can be represented .",
    "the positive - p stochastic method directly reproduces the normally ordered correlations and moments , while the wigner representation reproduces the symmetrically ordered moments",
    ". we also have to distinguish the internal and external operator moments , since measurements are normally performed on output fields that are external to the cavity . the technique for treating external field spectra",
    "was introduced by yurke@xcite , and by collett and gardiner@xcite .",
    "these external field measurements are obtained from the input - output relations of : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the input and output photon fields respectively , evaluated at the output - coupling mirror .",
    "the most efficient transport of squeezing is obtained if we assume that all the signal losses occur through the output coupler , so that @xmath56 .",
    "we will assume this to be the case .",
    "the crucial quadrature variables of the system have the definitions : @xmath57    there are also corresponding external quadrature field variables , defined as :    @xmath58    similarly , we can define c - number stochastic quadrature variables within the relevant representations , thus giving :    @xmath59    of especial interest is @xmath60 since this is the low - noise , squeezed quadrature . here",
    "we note that the instantaneous correlation functions of the intra - cavity field operators are called the moments .",
    "typically , they are not easily measurable , when compared to output moments or spectra , but they are useful in that they provide a check on the accuracy of the calculation of measurable spectra .",
    "the squeezing in terms of the intra - cavity quadrature variances corresponds to an instantaneous measurement of the field moments .",
    "if such a measurements were possible , it would include contributions from all frequencies . for measurements averaged over a long time @xmath61 , it is the low frequency part of the spectrum that is the relevant quantity , and we shall focus on this , as it usually determines the maximum squeezing possible .",
    "the output measured spectral variance @xmath62 of a general quadrature @xmath63 can be written    @xmath64    where the fluctuations @xmath65 are defined as @xmath66 and the frequency argument denotes a fourier transform : @xmath67    since the p - representation is normally ordered , it automatically provides the normally - ordered moments : @xmath68 also , the + p spectral correlations correspond to the normally ordered , time - ordered operator correlations of the measured fields .",
    "we therefore define fourier components of the normalized quadratures as : @xmath69    this leads to the following well - known result for the general squeezing spectrum , as measured in an external homodyne detection scheme : @xmath70 note that vacuum ( input ) field terms do not contribute directly to this spectrum , as they have a vanishing normally - ordered spectrum , and are not correlated with the coherent amplitudes in the + p representation .    in the case of the wigner representation",
    ", the correlations and moments are given with symmetric ordering .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath71 _ { + } /2\\right\\rangle = 1/2 $ ] in the vacuum state .",
    "the normally - ordered internal field moments are easily calculated , by using equal - time commutators to change the ordering from symmetric to normally - ordered : @xmath72    similarly , the normally - ordered squeezing spectrum , as measured in an external homodyne detection scheme is : @xmath73 it is essential here to include the vacuum field contributions from reflected input fields , as these are correlated with the internal wigner amplitudes , and hence have a significant contribution to the spectrum .",
    "in fact , these input fields can be shown to correspond directly to the noise terms in the relevant wigner equations , leading to the identification : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a c - number amplitude corresponding ( in the wigner representation ) to the quantum vacuum input field .",
    "the fundamental property of the wigner function is that the ensemble average of any polynomial of the random variable @xmath76 and @xmath77 weighted by the wigner density exactly corresponds to the hilbert - space expectation of the corresponding symmetrized product of the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "therefore , the truncated theory with a positive wigner function can be viewed as equivalent to a hidden variable theory , since one can obtain quadrature fluctuation predictions by following an essentially classical prescription ; in which even the noise terms have a classical interpretation as corresponding a form of zero - point fluctuation .",
    "this can not be equivalent to quantum mechanics in general , but may provide similar results to quantum mechanics under some circumstances .",
    "next we wish to rescale the equations . this has the merit of showing explicitly how a small noise expansion can permit us to use a type of perturbation theory",
    "whose zero - th order solution is the classical solution , rather than the feynman approach where the zero - th order solution is the free - particle case . in order to show this systematically , a formal perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath78",
    "is now introduced , where the scaling parameter @xmath78 is given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the threshold pump photon number , and a dimensionless decay ratio , @xmath81 is introduced .",
    "an equivalent definition is :    @xmath82    this clearly determines the ratio of nonlinear to linear rates of change .",
    "next , we introduce a scaled time @xmath83 and a dimensionless driving field @xmath84 , so that the equations can be expressed in terms of the three dimensionless parameters @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we expand the scaled coordinates in a power series in @xmath78 , to give : @xmath86    the expansion given here has the property that the zero - th order term corresponds to the large classical fields of order @xmath87 , while the first order term corresponds to the quantum fluctuations of order @xmath88 , and the higher order terms correspond to nonlinear corrections to the quantum fluctuations , of order @xmath78 and greater . for a given fundamental decay rate @xmath89 , the expansion coefficient @xmath90 is inversely proportional to the input photon flux required to obtain the threshold condition . thus , the smaller @xmath90 is , the larger the required input field",
