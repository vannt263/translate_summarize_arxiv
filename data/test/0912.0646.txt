    "strongly correlated fermionic systems , responsible for relevant many - body phenomena such as high - temperature superconductivity , the fractional quantum hall effect or metal - insulator transitions , represent one of the most important theoretical challenges in condensed matter physics . among the simplest possible models of interacting fermions in a 2d lattice is the hubbard model,@xcite which is believed to be one of the keys to understanding the theoretical riddle of high - temperature superconductivity,@xcite and which serves as a good example to illustrate the nature and scale of the difficulties encountered . in spite of a titanic effort by the condensed matter community spanning several decades ,",
    "still today the phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model and its relation to high - temperature superconductors remain highly controversial .    in the absence of exactly solvable models ,",
    "accurate numerical simulations are essential in order to gain further insight into the physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "while quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques are very powerful in simulating bosonic systems , they suffer from the so - called _ negative sign problem _ in the case of fermionic and frustrated models .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , generic 1d lattice systems can be accurately addressed with the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , @xcite but this approach scales inefficiently with the lattice size in 2d systems .",
    "recent progress in the simulation of 2d fermionic models has been made with a variety of methods .",
    "@xcite however , results obtained with different methods are often inconsistent , highlighting the need for further improvement and for alternative approaches .    a promising new route to studying strongly correlated fermion systems in a 2d lattice , presently under intense investigation ,",
    "@xcite is based on using a _ tensor network _ as ground state variational ansatz . for bosonic ( e.g. spin ) 2d lattice models ,",
    "tensor network anstze include _ projected entangled - pair states _ ( peps ) for inhomogeneous@xcite and homogeneous systems , @xcite and the _ _ multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz__@xcite ( mera ) .",
    "[ homogeneous peps are also known with names such as ( vertex ) _ _ tensor product states__@xcite ] .",
    "the interest in these approaches resides in the fact that they manage to retain some of the useful features of dmrg and qmc , while avoiding their main shortcomings .",
    "indeed , peps and mera approaches are free from the negative sign problem that prevents the application of qmc to fermionic and frustrated models . at the same time , and unlike dmrg , both peps and mera can efficiently represent ground states of 2d lattice models .",
    "in addition , compared to other variational approaches , peps and mera are relatively unbiased towards specific ground states .",
    "still at an early stage of development , the major limitation of these methods is that the cost of simulations increases sharply with the amount of entanglement in the ground state .",
    "this limits the range of models that can be analyzed accurately at present .",
    "nevertheless , several systems of frustrated antiferromagnets beyond the reach of dmrg and qmc have already been addressed.@xcite    in recent months , generalizations of tensor network algorithms to fermionic systems have been put forward independently by several groups.@xcite as a result , it is now possible to study interacting fermions in 2d lattices both within the context of the mera @xcite and peps .",
    "@xcite the fundamental new step , common in all the proposals , is to incorporate the fermionic character of the ground state wave function directly into the ansatz .",
    "this is accomplished by considering a _ network of fermionic operators _ , that is , a set of linear maps , made of anticommuting operators , that are connected according to a network pattern , as first proposed in refs .   for the mera and in ref .   for the peps .    in actual computations , one",
    "is still forced to store and manipulate tensors ( i.e. multi - dimensional arrays of coefficients ) corresponding e.g. to the expansion coefficients of the fermionic maps .",
    "the process of ` _ _ fermionization _ _ ' of a tensor network algorithm , i.e. its extension to fermionic systems , can in practice be achieved and visualized in a variety of ( ultimately equivalent ) ways , depending on how the underlying network of fermionic operators is translated into a set of tensors and rules for their manipulation .",
    "examples include the use of a jordan - wigner transformation , @xcite or the introduction of additional bond indices between tensors.@xcite a particularly simple form of ` _ _ fermionization _ _ ' of tensor networks was introduced in ref .  , where it was applied in the context of the mera .",
    "we emphasize that ref .",
    "is based on reformulating previous work by corboz , evenbly , verstraete and vidal on fermionic mera,@xcite which in turn had its origins in a key observation by verstraete.@xcite    the fermionization procedure of ref .  , which applies to any tensor network , is remarkedly simple .",
    "it does not require the introduction of a jordan - wigner transformation in the bond indices , or to have to explicitly keep track and dynamically modify a global fermionic order ; neither does it require the introduction of additional bond indices in the tensors . instead",
    ", the fermionic character of the tensor network is engraved in two simple rules : ( i ) use of parity invariant tensors and ( ii ) replacement of line crossings with so - called fermionic swap gates .",
    "the net result of applying these rules is a modified variational ansatz that can be manipulated using standard tensor network operations ( tensor multiplications , etc . ) , thus producing a straightforward fermionic version of existing tensor network algorithms .",
    "importantly , the computational cost of bosonic and fermionic algorithms scales in the same way with the amount of entanglement in the ground state .",
    "@xcite this remarkable result was also independently derived in ref .  .",
    "this paper has two main goals .",
    "the first is to explain how to obtain peps algorithms for fermionic systems by applying the above ` _ _ fermionization _ _ ' rules to existing bosonic peps algorithms .",
    "fermionic peps were originally proposed by kraus , schuch , verstraete and cirac in ref .   and have also been discussed by barthel , pineda and eisert in ref .  .",
    "our formulation of fermionic peps must be , at some level , equivalent to those proposals .",
    "however , the present formulation , which is based on previous independent work,@xcite is remarkably straightforward and appears to be comparatively much simpler . in particular",
    ", it allowed us to numerically implement a fermionic peps algorithm for infinite systems by only introducing a small number of changes to existing code for bosonic systems .",
    "a second main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of fermionic peps . in spite of the several existing formulations of fermionic peps , @xcite and with the exception of ref .  , where some qualitative results are reported for the @xmath0 model , no evidence has been presented yet showing that fermionic peps are a good variational ansatz for interacting fermion systems .",
    "[ notice , however , that ref .",
    "shows that gaussian fermionic peps can represent states of non - interacting fermions ] .",
    "here we do present such evidence , in the form of ground state computations for several 2d models .",
    "specifically , we use a fermionic version of the infinite peps ( ipeps ) algorithm@xcite to address models on an infinite square lattice .",
    "first , results for free spinless fermions are compared with the corresponding exact solution , showing that a peps with small bond dimension is capable of reproducing the ground state energy with several digits of accuracy .",
    "then a model of interacting spinless fermions is addressed .",
    "qualitatively , the simulation reproduces the phase diagram predicted within hartree - fock , with metal and charge - density wave phases separated by a line of first order phase transitions . at a quantitative level",
    ", however , we obtain ground state energies that are lower than those obtained with hartree - fock , and this shifts the boundary between phases significantly .",
    "finally , for the @xmath0 model , we obtain ground state energies that are close to those of a specialized gutziller - projected ansatz .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : peps ] reviews the peps formalism for bosonic systems and the general fermionization procedure of tensor networks introduced in ref .  , which is then applied to peps algorithms .",
    "[ sec : ctm ] considers in more detail the fermionic version of the ipeps algorithm for infinite 2d lattices , which was employed to obtain the benchmark results presented in this paper",
    "[ sec : results ] describes ground state calculations for systems of free and interacting fermions in an infinite 2d lattice .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains some conclusions , while appendix  [ app : genoperators ] defines generalized fermionic operators and appendix  [ app : twosite ] describes in detail one step of the update in the fermionic ipeps algorithm .",
    "_ note on terminology. _ for the purposes of this paper , a _",
    "tensor _ is simply a multi - dimensional array of complex coefficients , and a _ tensor network _ is a set of tensors some of whose indices are connected according to a network pattern , where being connected means that there is a sum or trace over that index , in the sense of tensor multiplication .",
    "accordingly , in this paper a bosonic / fermionic tensor network is a tensor network used in the context of simulating a bosonic / fermionic system .",
    "thus , in the present formulation a fermionic peps is simply a `` tensor network that serves as a variational ansatz for fermionic systems '' .",
    "it is different from a bosonic peps in the presence of special gates called fermionic swap gates ( and in that its tensors are necessarily parity preserving ) . in particular , even though the rules used to create a fermionic tensor network , as introduced in ref .   and",
    "reviewed here , were obtained by studying how to mimic a network of fermionic operators ( that is , of operators that obey anticommuting relations ) , here a fermionic peps is _ not _ a network of fermionic operators .",
    "one of the merits of the present formulation is precisely that it replaces the considerable complexity involved in dealing with a network of fermionic operators with a simple set of rules . in particular",
    ", it avoids having to explicitly define , keep track and dynamically modify a fermionic order for the bond indices .",
    "the equivalence between our formulation of a fermionic tensor network and a network of fermionic operators was already established in ref .   for the case of the mera .",
    "a general derivation of this equivalence would distract from the purpose of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the goal of this section is to introduce a fermionic version of bosonic peps algorithms,@xcite so that they can be applied to simulate fermionic systems in a 2d lattice .",
    "we start by reviewing some key aspects of the peps formalism for bosonic systems .",
    "this allows us to introduce the notation and the diagrammatic representation of tensors used throughout secs .",
    "[ sec : peps ] and [ sec : ctm ] .",
    "then we describe the fermionization rules of ref .  , which we also extensively review .",
    "we apply these rules to obtain a fermionic peps ansatz ( see also refs .  ) , and provide a discussion of how fermionic peps algorithms can be obtained by modifying existing bosonic peps algorithms .",

    "in recent months several theoretical proposals have appeared describing fermionic versions of tensor network algorithms for 2d lattice systems , namely fermionic mera@xcite and fermionic peps@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have explained how to obtain fermionic peps algorithms by applying the general fermionization procedure of tensor networks introduced in ref .  .",
    "a highlight of our formulation of fermionic peps is its simplicity : it replaces the complexity involved in dealing with a network of fermionic operators with a tensor network built by following two rules , namely the use of parity preserving tensors and the substitution of line crossings with fermionic swap gates .",
    "we have then used the fermionic ipeps algorithm to compute an approximation to the ground state of several fermionic models on an infinite lattice . by simulating an exactly solvable model of free fermions,@xcite",
    "we have been able to see that even a fermionic peps with small bond dimension @xmath43 ( @xmath310 ) is already capable of reproducing up to several digits of the exact ground state energy , as well as two - point correlators .",
    "the results also showed that , similarly to what had been observed with the fermionic mera,@xcite the accuracy of the approach depends on the amount of entanglement in the system . generally speaking , gapped systems are less entangled than critical ones and , accordingly , a fermionic ipeps with a given bond dimension @xmath43 produces better accuracies for the former .",
    "the simulation of model of interacting spinless fermions has provided us with a first clear indication of the usefulness of the fermionic peps as a variational ansatz for the ground state of systems of interacting fermions .",
    "the fermionic peps approach reproduces the hartree - fock phase diagram@xcite , with metal and charge - density wave phases ; but even with bond dimension @xmath255 and @xmath240 , it improves the ground state energies on the metallic phase and this results in a significant shift of the phase boundary .",
    "finally , results for the @xmath0 model in the relevant parameter range for cuprate superconductors are particularly encouraging , given that fermionic peps , still at an early stage of development , already produce ground state energies comparable with those of previous variational studies.@xcite    the main limitation in present calculations is due to the scaling @xmath229 of simulation costs with the peps bond dimension @xmath43 and the environment bond dimension @xmath208 , which restricts @xmath43 and @xmath208 to relatively small values .",
    "there are , however , several ways in which larger values of @xmath43 and @xmath208 could become affordable , thereby leading to more accurate results . on the one hand , one can incorporate the internal global symmetries of a model ( e.g. particle number conservation ) into the tensors and exploit their block structure to reduce computational costs.@xcite this strategy is expected to be decisive for the characterization of the phase diagram of the @xmath0 and hubbard models . on the other hand , monte carlo sampling techniques could be used to reduce the formal dependence of the simulation costs in @xmath43 and @xmath208 .",
