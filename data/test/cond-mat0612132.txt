    "1 , the double - well potential can be created by superposing a far - off blue - detuned laser beam ( which generating a repulsive optical dipole force for atoms ) upon the magnetic trap . the combined double - well potential is@xmath2 + u_{0}e^{-\\left ( x - x_{0}\\right ) ^{2}/w_{x}^{2}-\\left ( y^{2}+z^{2}\\right ) /w_{\\perp } ^{2 } } , \\label{external potential}\\]]where the first term is the trapping potential due to the magnetic trap , while the second term represents the potential due to the laser beam .        for the bose gases confined in this double - well potential",

    "( i ) if the height @xmath3 of the external potential due to the laser beam is smaller than the chemical potential of the system , the two sub - condensates can be regarded to be coherently separated after the evaporative cooling . in this situation , the two coherently - separated sub - condensates can be regarded as a single condensate .",
    "the relative phase of two sub - condensates is thus locked .",
    "( ii ) if the height @xmath3 of the laser beam is much larger than the chemical potential of the system so that the tunneling effect can be omitted safely , the two condensates are completely independent after the evaporative cooling .    for two",
    "coherently separated sub - condensates , every atom is described by the following normalization wave function @xmath4 /\\sqrt{n},\\]]where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the normalization wave functions accounting for the two sub - condensates .",

    "the average particle numbers in each condensate are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . after removing the double - well potential , the evolution of the wave function @xmath10",
    "can be obtained based on the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the density expectation value is then @xmath11 + n_{2}\\left\\vert \\phi _ { c2}\\left ( \\mathbf{r},t\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}.   \\label{coherent - density}\\end{aligned}\\]]the second term in the above equation accounts for the interference effect when there is an overlapping between two sub - condensates upon expansion .",
    "for @xmath12 satisfying the gp equation , the nonlinear effects in the interference pattern of two coherently separated sub - condensates were investigated in refs @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , if the intensity of the blue - detuned laser beam is sufficiently high so that the tunneling effect can be omitted , the two condensates can be regarded to be completely independent .",
    "in this situation , the number of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 in each of the two condensates are fixed .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath8 particles described by the wave function @xmath13 in the left well , while there are @xmath9 particles described by the wave function @xmath14 in the right well . to investigate clearly the role of the exchange symmetry of identical particles and interatomic interaction , we calculate in the following the density expectation value @xmath15 directly from the many - body wave function . in sec .",

    "we will prove in sec .",
    "iv that in the presence of the interatomic interaction , @xmath16 and @xmath17 will become non - orthogonal after the overlapping between two initially independent condensates .",
    "thus we consider here the following general case from the beginning@xmath18after removing the double - well potential , the two initially independent condensates will overlap , and thus one should consider the indistinguishability of identical particles .",

    "when the non - orthogonal property between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is considered , one should note that the normalization constant @xmath22 is relevant to the parameter @xmath26 . from the form of the many - body wave function ( [ wave - function ] ) , the quantum depletion originating from interparticle interaction is omitted .",
    "thus , this form of quantum state is valid when @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being respectively the scattering length and mean distance between particles .",
    "the role of quantum depletion will be discussed in sec .",

    "for the many - body wave function @xmath62 , in the presence of the interatomic interaction , the evolution equation can be obtained based on the standard quantum mechanical principle .",

    "we have given the evolution equations about @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , an important question emerges naturally : is it physical for @xmath37 being nonzero with the development of time ?    based on the evolution equations ( [ gp1 ] ) and ( [ gp2 ] ) given in the last section , one can understand easily that @xmath37 becomes nonzero after the overlapping between two initially independent condensates in the presence of the interatomic interaction . before removing the double - well potential , @xmath79 and @xmath80 because there is no overlapping between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "this quantum state becomes a superposition of different number of particles in the orthogonal modes @xmath13 and @xmath207 .",
    "this result is very natural because the coupling ( interaction ) between two initially independent condensates leads to the coherent transfer of particles between two condensates . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that for a single condensate , a coherent state description of the bose condensed system is a robust state in the presence of the interactions between the condensate and its environment .",
    "in the present work , our research shows that the interaction between two condensates makes each condensate become a coherent superposition of different particle number . the results in ref .",
    "barnett about the robustness of the coherent state imply that @xmath288 is a robust quantum state even when the coupling with the environment exists .",
    "in summary , upon expansion , we calculate the density expectation value of two initially independent condensates . it is found that there is a nonzero interference term when the interatomic interaction and the exchange symmetry of identical bosons are both considered carefully .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that the interaction plays an essential role in the formation of the order parameter of bose - condensed gases , i.e. the formation of a stable coherent property . here",
    ", we provide an example in which the interaction induces coherent evolution between two initially independent condensates .    in the present popular viewpoint , the high - order correlation function and quantum measurement process are used to interpret the interference patterns observed for two initially independent condensates .",
    "although we find that there is already high - contrast interference patterns in the density expectation value for the experimental parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is still possible that the high - order correlation function and thus the mechanism of the interference due to the measurement process play an important role in the emergence of the interference patterns .",
    "thus , to investigate more clearly the interference pattern due to the measurement process alone , we believe an experimental investigation of two independent ideal condensates would be very interesting , because there is no interference term for ideal condensates in the density expectation value . in the last few years ,",
    "the rapid experimental advances of feshbach resonance where the scattering length can be tuned from positive to negative make this sort of experiment be feasible .",
