    "one of the important problems in astrophysics is to trace back the galaxy evolution to the epoch at which galaxies formed .",
    "recently steidel and collaborators have pioneered and widely utilized a multicolor technique to select young galaxies by use of lyman - break dropout , and discovered a class of actively star - forming galaxies in high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) universe ( steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "some lens - magnified normal galaxies at high redshift also show rather high star formation rate ( ebbels et al . 1996 ; yee et al . 1996 ; franx et al .",
    "1997 ; trager et al .",
    "furthermore , ohta et al . ( 1996 ) and omont et al . ( 1996 ) detected co emission lines in the quasar br12020725 at redshift @xmath6 , suggesting the existence of a large amount of molecular gas and dust in the object .",
    "all of these results imply that strong star formation and synthesis of heavy elements have already occurred in such an early stage of the universe .",
    "the violent initial bursts of star formation must have produced large amount of dust , so that the optical deep surveys of protogalaxies inevitably suffer from the bias induced by severe dust extinction .",
    "the dust particles reprocess the starlight , and bulk of the bolometric luminosity of these young galaxies will be emitted at far - infrared ( fir ) ",
    "submillimeter ( sub - mm ) wavelengths .",
    "the fir emission from galaxies , especially from those are so faint that we are unable to resolve , produces the cosmic infrared background radiation ( cirb ) .",
    "therefore the cirb provides important information on the past star formation history of galaxies including the inaccessible sources ( e.g. bond , carr , & hogan 1986 ; burigana et al .",
    "the recently reported detection of an isotropic diffuse light at @xmath7 m has given this field new impetus ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; see also fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ; hauser et al . 1998 )",

    "1996 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ) .",
    "because fir is the wavelength at which dust reradiates the optical  uv radiation from young stars , the steeply increasing sfr density is expected to propose a significant increment of fir source counts , which may be related to the evolving population of star - forming galaxies discovered by _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( @xmath11 ) ( hacking & houck 1987 ( hh87 ) ; hacking , condon , & houck 1987 ; saunders et al .",

    "although this survey is much deeper than the  survey , it covers only a small solid angle of the sky ( 1600 arcmin@xmath14 ) and much wider sky coverage is necessary in the next step to obtain a huge sample .",

    "one of the main purposes of the  mission is a fir all - sky survey deeper than  surveys , and the fir instrument represents a significant improvement over , so that much higher sensitivity is achieved ( detection limit is @xmath15 mjy at @xmath16 m , @xmath17 mjy at @xmath18 m , and @xmath19 mjy at @xmath20 m ) .    in order to examine the performance of the survey",
    ", we estimated the fir galaxy counts based on a simple model with various sets of cosmological parameters and evolution types . there have been a number of attempts to predict the source counts or the cirb properties .",
    "the models of the source counts and cirb generally fall into two categories ( e.g. eales & edmunds 1997 ) : one is tied closely to the nearby observational results but makes no attempts to incorporate detailed galaxy evolution models ( e.g. beichman & helou 1991 ( bh91 ) ; pearson & rowan - robinson 1996 ) .",
    "these models are based on the local fir luminosity function ( lf ) and the observational evidence of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies in the fir  sub - mm , with the assumptions of simple functional forms for the evolution .",
    "the other is based on the models constructed by detailed physical processes related to the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. franceschini et al .",
    "1994 ; guiderdoni et al .",
    "they tend to be very complex with large numbers of parameters , which give rise to a number of related problems poorly understood .",
    "ellis ( 1997 ) names the former `` empirical approach '' and the latter `` _ ab initio _ approach '' . despite each category of models has its own merits and demerits , we preferred the `` empirical approach '' , because it is free of the parameters which are inherent in specific models and thus easy to understand the dependence on the cosmological and evolutional parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the general formulation of our model .",
    "the parameters to execute our calculations and their consistency with previous survey results are examined in section 3 .",
    "we present the _ iris_-based results and related discussions in section 4 , and our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "first we construct a model of galaxy sed from fir to sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the fir emission originates from several dust components of different grain sizes and temperatures , reprocessing the interstellar radiation ( dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) .",
    "rowan - robinson & crawford ( 1989)(rc89 ) showed that the fir spectrum of   galaxies is well fitted by the combination of two components : cool disk emission from interstellar dust ( cirrus component ) and hot starburst - induced emission , from optically thick dust clouds heated by numbers of ob stars .",
    "therefore we consider a simple model of two components , cool cirrus and hot starbursts as the components of our model seds of galaxies .",
    "we must note that we ignore the power - law component seen in agn or qso spectra , because contribution of these power - law objects is expected to be negligible in number compared with the total number of infrared ( ir ) sources , and because their luminosity contribution is also small in fir wavelength range , though it might be slightly higher in very high-@xmath4 universe ( pearson 1996 ) .",
    "we define the total ir luminosity @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the monochromatic luminosity of a galaxy , and we put @xmath24 hz ( @xmath25 mm ) and @xmath26 hz ( @xmath27 m ) .    here",
    "we assume that the ir luminosity of a galaxy less than @xmath28 is composed of the cirrus component @xmath29 only .",
    "for galaxies with @xmath30 , the ir luminosity in excess of @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , is assumed to come from the starburst component , denoted as @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the composite sed of a galaxy is expressed as follows ; @xmath34 where @xmath29 and @xmath33 are normalized as @xmath35 and @xmath36 this model formulation is in line of bh91 .",
    "so as to make our model work well , @xmath21 should be uniquely defined from the value @xmath37 at any frequency @xmath38 .",
    "the seds depend only on @xmath21 , and do not vary with redshift as long as @xmath21 of a galaxy is constant .",
    "the cirrus spectrum we used is based on the model of dsert et al .",
    "their model spectrum is the sum of three subcomponents , that are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; peaked at @xmath39 m ) , very small grains ( peaked at @xmath40 m ) , and big grains ( peaked at @xmath41 m ) .",
    "no ir emission lines are included in our model .",
    "as mentioned above , galaxies with @xmath42 only have the cirrus component in the present model . at each ir luminosity",
    ", the galaxy sed is scaled properly to yield the given @xmath21 according to eq.([cirrusspec ] ) .      as for galaxies with @xmath43 , bulk of the ir luminosity",
    "is due to dust emission from an intense starburst in giant molecular clouds ( e.g. sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "therefore we assume that , for galaxies whose ir luminosities are brighter than @xmath44 , their ir luminosities in excess of @xmath28 consist of starbursts with two different temperatures according to bh91 .",
    "we give the starburst flux @xmath33 as a superposition of thermal blackbody radiation spectrum of temperature @xmath45 ( we call it `` hot component '' of starbursts ) and that of @xmath46 ( `` cool component '' ) , multiplied with dust emissivity .",
    "we adopted the wavelength - dependent dust emissivity @xmath47 ( rc89 ) . by using the above temperatures ,",
    "@xmath33 is expressed by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the planck function with temperature @xmath50 and both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are normalizing constants ( rc89 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the starburst components are given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( bh91 ; see also rieke & lebofsky 1986 ; helou 1986 ; soifer et al .",
    "the cool component gives a good representation of the larger ( 0.010.1 @xmath0 m ) grains modeled by rowan - robinson ( 1986 ) , and the hot component gives an approximate representation of the very small grains postulated by boulanger , baud , & van albada ( 1985 ) , draine & anderson ( 1985 ) , and rowan - robinson ( 1992 ) .",
    "normalizing constants , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , are determined by the following equations ( bh91 ) : @xmath55    the model seds of galaxies with @xmath56 constructed in this manner are shown in fig .",

    "it is clearly seen that @xmath106 does not affect the number count within the detectable flux range of   as shown in fig .",
    "the effect of evolution appears most significantly at @xmath161 @xmath0 m among the assumed bands , and the total detection number becomes twice larger .",
    "thus , the determination of the amplitude of galaxy evolution is best estimated at around @xmath162 m in the wavelength and flux coverage of . with the aid of such a vast number of galaxy detections , we will be able to evaluate the evolution strength ( @xmath99 or @xmath84 ) precisely . in the case of @xmath161-@xmath0 m band ,",
    "statistical fluctuation becomes much smaller than those of previous area - limited deep surveys .",
    "consequently the errors in the estimation of @xmath99 or @xmath84 will be small enough , at least , to determine them in the relatively low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) universe .",
    "unfortunately , there exists no drastic difference between luminosity and density evolution in the behaviors of number count , and judging which evolution takes place from number count alone still remains as a difficult work .      using the  fis flux detection limits we gave in section [ fislim ]",
    ", we calculate the redshift distribution of galaxies detected by the  all - sky survey .",
    "figure 7 shows the expected redshift distribution of galaxies detected in the assumed four bands .",
    "figure 7a illustrates the prediction at 50-@xmath0 m band .",
    "figures 7b , 7c , and 7d are the same as fig",
    ". 7a , except that they show the predictions at 70- , 120- , and 150-@xmath0 m bands , respectively .",
    "solid curves denote the predictions for @xmath142 , and dashed curves , @xmath143 .",
    "larger @xmath106 leads to deeper @xmath4-distribution . in any bandpasses , the numbers of galaxies at @xmath163 are @xmath164 , and several times larger with evolution .",
    "namely , low-@xmath4 galaxies are the overwhelming majority among the detected objects . the steep increases of galaxy number at @xmath165 seen in figs . 7c and 7d",
    "are attributed to the peak at @xmath41 m , which originates from big grains , in the sed of low-@xmath21 ( @xmath166 ) galaxies .",
    "figure 8 is an example of the redshift distribution for detected galaxies with various @xmath21 ( @xmath142 , no evolution ) .",
    "such galaxies can be detected only within @xmath165 .",
    "the lf we employed makes them to be abundant ; if we use flatter faint - end slope of the lf , the increases would be less prominent .",
    "the overall shape of the redshift distribution depends on the observing bandpass wavelength .",
    "nearest galaxies ( @xmath167 ) are more likely to be detected in longer wavelength @xmath168 m , and their detection number steeply decreases with increasing @xmath4 in the longest wavelengths .",
    "galaxies which lie within the redshift range of @xmath169 are expected to be detected more at 70 @xmath0 m than at the other bands . when the galaxy redshift exceeds @xmath170 , they become harder to be detected in the shorter bands , while they remain detectable in the longer bands .",
    "the detection numbers at @xmath171 m and @xmath172 m , therefore , surpass those at @xmath173 m and 70 @xmath0 m for the furthest galaxies .",
    "this is understood as follows . at significant redshift ( @xmath5 ) , the detected objects are the most luminous starbursts , whose seds peak at around @xmath174 m in the rest frame .",
    "since the peaks of luminous starbursts shift away from their rest wavelength , they are not detected at high-@xmath4 in shorter wavelengths .",
    "instead , in the longer wavebands , redshift effect makes their observed flux density nearly constant ( known as the negative @xmath175-correction ) , and they can be still seen at high-@xmath4 .      as we saw in section [ reddist ] , most of the objects detected in the  galaxy survey are nearby ones . hence , when we focus on the very young or primeval galaxies , an efficient method to pick up such candidates without knowing their spectroscopic redshifts will be very useful .",
    "we , here , make attempts to utilize the peaks of the seds to estimate the redshifts roughly from their fir colors alone .",
    "we suppose that all the galactic objects are taken away by certain methods .",
    "this may well be possible at high galactic latitudes .",
    "figure 9 shows the loci of galaxies with various @xmath21 on the fir color  color ( @xmath176  @xmath177 ) plane , where @xmath178 is the detected flux density of galaxies at wavelength @xmath145 [ @xmath0 m ] in unit of @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "filled symbols are put on every @xmath180 interval from @xmath181 .",
    "when the sources fade away from the  detection limits , we do not show their loci and symbols .",
    "red filled squares represent the colors of the low-@xmath4 ( @xmath182 ) galaxies , green filled squares the intermediate-@xmath4 ( @xmath183 ) , and blue filled circles the high-@xmath4 ( @xmath184 ) ones .",
    "because of the way of the construction of our model seds , galaxies with @xmath185 have the same colors ( the red filled square at the top - right ) .",
    "to see how the existence of starburst component changes the color of cool cirrus galaxies , we put the galaxies of @xmath186 with an interval of @xmath187 ( denoted by open squares from the top - right to down - left ) .",
    "they correspond to the galaxies whose ir luminosity fraction of the superposed starburst is 20.6 , 36.7 , 50.0 , 60.2 , 68.4 , 74.9 , 80.0 , 84.2 , and 87.4 % , respectively .",
    "when we consider the color selection criteria , the intrinsic scatter of galaxy color has to be taken into account .",
    "schmitt et al . ( 1997 ) proposed the template seds of various classes of galaxies .",
    "their seds show that the dispersion at fir wavelength is an order unity .",
    "the scatter of  @xmath188 is also known to be an order of magnitude ( rc89 ) . considering these scatters",
    ", we can estimate the domains where galaxies locate on the fir color - color plane .",
    "we show the the domains of low- ( @xmath182 ) , intermediate- ( @xmath183 ) and high-@xmath4 ( @xmath189 ) galaxies with a red dashed rhomboid , a green solid rectangle , and a blue solid rectangle , respectively .",
    "the high-@xmath4 and mid-@xmath4 regions are well separated on this diagram .",
    "we must think of the overlap between low-@xmath4 and mid / high-@xmath4 domains . the low-@xmath4 population creeping in the mid / high-@xmath4 domain consists of only low-@xmath21 galaxies ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "as we have seen in section [ reddist ] , such galaxies quickly become undetectable with increasing redshift and reside in @xmath191 .",
    "the expected optical magnitude based on seds extended to optical region ranges from @xmath192 mag to @xmath193 mag ( hirashita et al .",
    "since the positional accuracy of the  survey is quite good ( @xmath194  @xmath195 ) and surface density of such bright galaxies is low enough , these galaxies would be identified easily with optical counterparts .",
    "on the contrary , the high-@xmath4 galaxies are expected to have fainter magnitudes ( @xmath15 mag ) ( hirashita et al .",
    "thus the cross correlation with optical survey data such as poss , or forthcoming sdss would identify most of the low-@xmath4 ir - galaxies .",
    "evolutionary effect makes the mid / high-@xmath4 galaxy more abundant , and the fraction of such objects in the overlapped region will be higher .",
    "thus , color classification of galaxy redshift can be practicable using sets of bandpasses @xmath196 , and @xmath172 m with the aid of present and future optical surveys .",
    "in this paper we examined the performance of the  fir all - sky survey , one of whose main purposes is to study galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "we used a simple empirical model for galaxy number count estimation , by adopting a multicomponent sed model which consists of cirrus and starburst components , and the nearby fir luminosity function derived from that of _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "a few @xmath197 galaxies will be detected by the  all - sky survey , which is 100 times larger number of detection than that of .",
    "2 .   shorter wavelength bandpass ( @xmath198 m ) is suitable for intermediate-@xmath4 ( @xmath183 ) galaxy detection , while longer wavelength ( @xmath199 m ) one is for high-@xmath4 ( @xmath184 ) and nearby ( @xmath182 ) galaxies .",
    "we will detect the effect of galaxy evolution and can evaluate the amplitude of evolution at least in the nearby universe in the   survey , but still it is difficult to constrain which type of evolution takes place , from the number count alone . on the contrary , the intensity of the cirb complementarily provides us much tighter constraint on the form of galaxy evolution at very high-@xmath4 .",
    "4 .   redshift estimation using galaxy fir colors can be practicable using sets of bandpasses @xmath196 , and @xmath172 m with the aid of present and future optical surveys .",
