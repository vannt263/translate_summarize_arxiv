    "there is a resurgence of interest in such theories which naturally arise in string - theoretic considerations ( cf .",
    "brane models with gauss - bonett terms @xcite )",
    ". an interesting feature of higher order theories is that inflation emerges in these theories in a most direct way . in one of the first inflationary models , proposed in 1980 by starobinsky @xcite",
    ", inflation is due to the @xmath1 correction term in a gravitational lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "the dynamics of higher order cosmologies is closely related to scalar - field cosmologies in general relativity because of their conformal equivalence @xcite .",
    "there are certain limitations to this procedure related to the issue of physical reality of the two metrics involved @xcite and to the fact that the conformal transformation may fail to be regular at all points of the spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , it is practically useful and investigations in the conformal frame have given some interesting results , e.g. the cosmic no - hair theorem in quadratic cosmologies @xcite .",
    "most of the studies of scalar - field cosmologies with the dynamical systems methods are restricted to frw models ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , although there are important investigations in spatially homogeneous bianchi cosmologies with an exponential potential @xcite .",
    "in particular , for flat frw models with a scalar field there are some general results which do not rely on the particular properties of the potential @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is more delicate for positively curved frw models with a scalar field having a potential with a zero local minimum .",
    "the main problem which confronts us is the following : can a closed universe filled with ordinary matter and a scalar field avoid recollapse ?    in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of positively curved frw models with a scalar field having the potential which arises in the conformal frame of the @xmath0 theory in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this choice is presented in section iii .",
    "the dimension of the dynamical systems involved in such models is greater than two and the usual methods of phase plane analysis can not be applied .",
    "in particular , for nonhyperbolic equilibrium points the linearization theorem does not yield any information about the stability of the equilibria and therefore , more powerful methods are needed .",
    "the center manifold theorem shows that the qualitative behavior in a neighborhood of a nonhyperbolic equilibrium point @xmath4 is determined by its behavior on the center manifold near @xmath5 since the dimension of the center manifold is generally smaller than the dimension of the dynamical system , this greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "the other general method for simplifying the dynamical system is the normal form theory , which consists in a nonlinear coordinate transformation that allows to simplify the nonlinear part of the system .",
    "both methods are used in sections iii and iv respectively .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we write down the field equations assuming an arbitrary potential , as a constrained four - dimensional dynamical system . in section",
    "iii , we use the constraint equation to reduce the dimension of the system to three and after a suitable change of variables we find the equilibrium points of the system and discuss the physical meaning of these particular solutions .",
    "in particular we show using the methods of the center manifold theory that , the equilibrium corresponding to the de sitter solution is asymptotically unstable . in section",
    "iv we find the so - called normal form of the dynamical system , which greatly simplifies the problem , since two of the equations decouple .",
    "we study the qualitative behavior of the resulted two - dimensional system and analyze the late time evolution of the model .",

    "v we apply the same techniques to flat frw spaces filled with a barotropic fluid in the conformal frame of the @xmath6 theory and study the detailed evolution of the models .",
    "in general relativity the evolution of frw models with a scalar field ( ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 ) are governed by the friedmann equation , @xmath9 the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath10 the equation of motion of the scalar field , @xmath11 and the conservation equation , @xmath12 we adopt the metric and curvature conventions of ref .",

    "@xmath17 the dimension of the dynamical system reduces to four .    in the literature of scalar - field cosmologies the exponential potential function _",
    "viz_. @xmath18 , is the most popular not only because of the variety of alternative theories of gravity which predict exponential potentials , but also due to the fact that this potential has the nice property that @xmath19 which allows the introduction of normalized variables according to the formalism of wainwright _ et _ _ al _ @xcite . in flat , @xmath20 frw models for example with a scalar field having an exponential potential , introducing the variables @xmath21 and the time coordinate @xmath22 ,",
    "enables the evolution equations to be written as a two - dimensional dynamical system ( cf .",

    "if we set @xmath23 the evolution equations ( [ fri2jm])-([conssfjm ] ) in vacuum become@xmath24 subject to the constraint @xmath25 therefore , the phase space of the dynamical system ( [ k1 ] ) is the set @xmath26",
    "in the remainder of the paper we assume that the potential function of the scalar field is @xmath27 which arises in the conformal frame of the @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "this potential has a long and flat plateau . for large values of @xmath28 the potential , @xmath29 is almost constant , @xmath30 thus @xmath31 has the general properties for inflation to commence . in @xcite",
    "it was proved a cosmic no - hair theorem , i.e. bianchi models with ordinary matter satisfying the strong energy condition and a scalar field with potential ( [ pote ] ) , asymptotically isotopize . according to this picture ,",
    "the universe started in a homogeneous state and during inflation it had enough time to isotropize .    in order to reduce the dimension of the dynamical system ( [ k1 ] ) we use the constraint ( [ constk ] ) to eliminate @xmath32 the evolution equations become@xmath33 linearization of ( [ sys1 ] ) near the equilibrium point @xmath34 shows that the jacobian matrix at that point has one zero and two purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "consequently the hartman - grobman theorem does not apply .",

    "the center manifold theorem implies that there exists a local 2-dimensional stable manifold through @xmath4 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "that means that all trajectories asymptotically approaching @xmath4 as @xmath51 lie on a 2-dimensional invariant manifold . since @xmath4 is a nonhyperbolic fixed point , the topology of the flow near @xmath4 is nontrivial and is characterized by a one - dimensional local center manifold intersecting @xmath52 in the appendix we prove the following result .",
    "the equilibrium point @xmath50 of ( [ sys3 ] ) is locally asymptotically unstable .",
    "it is easy to see that at the equilibrium point , @xmath53 the eigenvalues of the jacobian of ( [ sys3 ] ) are @xmath54 and therefore , we can not infer about the stability of the equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , it is the most interesting case , because in all other equilibria the scalar field reaches the flat plateau , which is impossible if we restrict ourselves to initial values of @xmath55 smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "the study of the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium point is difficult even in two dimensions .",

    "it is easy to obtain the phase portrait of ( [ 2dim ] ) via numerical integration .",
    "however , we can analyze the qualitative behavior of the trajectories using theoretical arguments .",
    "firstly , ( [ 2dim ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath76 @xmath77 ( which implies that all trajectories are symmetric with respect to the @xmath78 axis ) and the line @xmath79 is invariant .",

    "note that @xmath55 is always decreasing along the orbits while @xmath78 is decreasing in the first quadrant .",
    "since no trajectory can cross the line @xmath86 all trajectories starting above this line , approach the origin asymptotically . on any orbit starting in the first quadrant below",
    "the line @xmath86 @xmath55 becomes zero at some time and the trajectory crosses vertically the @xmath87axis . once the trajectory enters the second quadrant , @xmath78 increases and @xmath55 decreases .",
    "the phase portrait is shown in figure 1 .    at first sight",
    ", it seems probable that an initially expanding universe may recollapse .",

    "any trajectory spirals clockwise in the @xmath72 plane while both @xmath55 and @xmath90 are decreasing . in physical terms",
    "this means that the scalar field oscillates around the minimum of the potential with a decreasing amplitude , @xmath55 is always decreasing and , in view of ( [ constk ] ) , the curvature decreases . a typical trajectory of ( [ cartesian ] ) is shown in figure 2 .",
    "consider a flat frw model containing a barotropic fluid with an equation of state @xmath91 where @xmath92 and a scalar field having the potential ( [ pote ] ) .",
