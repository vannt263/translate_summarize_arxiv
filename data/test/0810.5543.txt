    "many nonequilibrium systems typically exhibit currents of different observables ( e.g. , mass , energy , spin , etc . ) which characterize their macroscopic behavior .",
    "these currents fluctuate , and the ( large deviation ) functional which determines the probability of these fluctuations is a natural candidate to generalize the concept of _ free energy _ to nonequilibrium systems . in this way ,",
    "understanding how microscopic dynamics determine the long - time averages of these currents and their fluctuations is one of the main objectives of nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "an important step in this direction has been the development of fluctuation theorems @xcite , which relate the probability of forward and backward currents reflecting the time - reversal symmetry of microscopic dynamics .",
    "these are relations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the probability of observing a time - integrated current @xmath2 after a long time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is some constant such that @xmath5 corresponds to the rate of entropy production @xcite . despite this progress , we still lack a general approach based on few simple principles to understand current statistics in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "this has triggered an intense research effort in recent years .",
    "for instance , bertini , de sole , gabrielli , jona - lasinio and landim @xcite have recently introduced a hydrodynamic fluctuation theory ( hft ) to study both current and profile large dynamic fluctuations in nonequilibrium steady states , providing a variational principle which describes the most probable ( possibly time - dependent ) profile responsible of a given current fluctuation .",
    "simultaneously , bodineau and derrida @xcite have conjectured an additivity principle for current fluctuations which enables one to explicitely calculate the current distribution for 1d diffusive systems in contact with two boundary baths .",
    "this principle , which is equivalent within hft to the hypothesis that the optimal profile is time - independent @xcite , has been recently confirmed in a model of heat conduction @xcite .",
    "the predictions derived from the additivity principle and the hydrodynamic fluctuation theory have been tested in few models for which the exact current distribution can be calculated . for more general cases in which no exact solutions are available ,",
    "new algorithms that allow the direct evaluation of large deviation functions in computer simulations have been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on a modification of the microscopic dynamics , so that the rare events responsible of the current large deviation are no longer rare .",
    "though successful , the new algorithms seem to suffer from finite - size effects when measuring the probability of extreme current deviations @xcite . here again the existence of simplified models for which exact solutions can be obtained is essential to elucidate the origin and importance of these finite - size corrections in simulations .    the aim of this paper is to present one of these simplified models , i.e. a toy model of heat transport between two thermal baths at different temperatures .",
    "the simplicity of this model allows us to gain a better understanding of : ( i ) system statistics during a large deviation event and how it reflects the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics , and ( ii ) finite - size corrections to the direct evaluation of large deviation functions .",
    "the model and the calculation of its current large deviation function are presented is section ii .",
    "the probabilities of having certain configuration at the end of a large deviation event and for intermediate times are calculated in section iii , while section iv is devoted to analyze their relation in terms of the reversibility of microscopic dynamics .",
    "simulation results are described in section v , together with an analysis of finite - size corrections affecting the direct evaluation of large deviation functions .",
    "this analysis provides a deep understanding of the range of validity of this simulation method , which otherwise can be determined using the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem .",
    "finally , section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "our toy model consists in a single lattice site characterized by an energy @xmath6 .",
    "this site is coupled to two thermal baths at different temperatures , @xmath7 ( left ) and @xmath8 ( right ) , and we assume @xmath9 without loss of generality .",
    "dynamics is stochastic and proceeds as follows : ( i ) with equal probability , we randomly choose the system to interact with one of the heat baths , @xmath7 or @xmath8 ; ( ii ) a new energy @xmath10 is drawn from the distribution @xmath11 corresponding to the ( inverse ) temperature of the selected heat bath , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of a temperature gradient then forces the system out of equilibrium .",
    "the transition rate @xmath14 from configuration @xmath15 to @xmath10 interacting with bath @xmath13 can be written as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the transition rate is normalized , @xmath18 , thus guaranteeing the conservation of probability during the stochastic evolution .",
    "this model can be regarded as the single - site version of the one - dimensional kipnis - marchioro - presutti ( kmp ) model of heat conduction @xcite . having",
    "a single site then implies that no energy diffusion takes place , but only energy exchange with the thermal reservoirs .",
    "associated to the interaction with the baths there is an energy current through the system , @xmath19 .",
    "we may define this current at the microscopic level in different ways . for the time being , let us define @xmath19 in a symmetric way @xmath20 in this way , positive currents correspond to the transport of energy from the left to the right reservoir . in the steady state ,",
    "the probability density for having an energy @xmath15 can be trivially calculated @xmath21 and hence local equilibrium does not hold for this toy model .",
    "notice that @xmath22 , despite being non - gibbsian , can be related to the transition rate @xmath23 via detailed balance .",
    "the mean energy is @xmath24 , while the average current is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore fourier s law trivially holds in this system for arbitrarily large temperature gradients , @xmath26 , with a thermal conductivity @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , in equilibrium ( @xmath28 ) , current fluctuations have a variance @xmath29 .",
    "these values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 agree with the thermal conductivity and current variance of the spatially - extended kmp model @xcite , reinforcing the view that this model is just the single site version of the kmp process .",
    "let now @xmath32 be the probability of having the system in configuration @xmath15 with a total _ time - integrated _ current @xmath33 after a long time @xmath3 , starting from a configuration @xmath34 .",
    "this probability depends also on the temperatures of the boundary thermal baths , but we drop this dependence here for notation convenience .",
    "@xmath32 obeys the following master equation in a general context , meaning `` sum over configurations '' , independently of whether configuration space is discrete or continuous .",

    "the function @xmath41 is typically everywhere negative except for @xmath42 , for which it is zero , meaning that current fluctuations away from the average are exponentially unlikely in time . in most cases it is convenient to work with the moment - generating functions of the above distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for long @xmath3",

    "therefore the interval @xmath241 $ ] defines the range of validity of the method of ref .",
    "for a high confidence level @xmath242 and @xmath243 clones ( as used in our simulations ) , we find @xmath244 and @xmath245 , in excellent agreement with the observed deviation from the exact result , see inset to left panel in fig .",

    "[ finitesize ] ( left ) .    an important consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ lcrit ] ) is that the range of validity of the algorithm , @xmath241 $ ] , increases _ logarithmically _ with the number of clones used in the simulation .",
    "therefore an appreciable increase of this range of validity in @xmath91-space demands an exponential increase in the number of clones , which is unfeasible in most situations of interest .",
    "we conjecture that this logarithmic increase of the range @xmath241 $ ] is not particular of our toy model , but a general feature for models with bounded values of @xmath91 .",
    "however , this shortcoming does not forbid in practice to push the algorithm far enough to observe very large current deviations .",
    "indeed , the current @xmath90 conjugate to parameter @xmath91 increases very rapidly as @xmath91 approaches its bounds ( -@xmath246 and @xmath114 in this model ) , so a small ( logarithmic ) increase of the validity range @xmath241 $ ] for @xmath73 is translated into a large increase of the range of current values for which we can measure with confidence the current ldf , @xmath41 . for most many particle non - trivial systems of interest",
    "we usually do nt know the analytical form of the large deviation function to be measured in simulations .",
    "it is hence necessary to develop a reliable method to determine the range of validity of our numerical measurements .",
    "it is at this point where the symmetries of the large deviation function play a prominent role . in particular ,",
    "most systems of interest obey the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem which results from the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics .",
    "this relation can be stated as @xmath81 for the legendre transform of the ldf , with @xmath4 some constant , see also eq .",
    "( [ fth ] ) . for our toy model , @xmath82 .",
    "violations of this fluctuation symmetry are expected whenever finite - size corrections induce a bias in the measurement of @xmath73 , and therefore the gallavotti - cohen symmetry of the current ldf can be used to numerically bound the range of validity of simulation results .",
    "this is confirmed in figs .",
    "[ muss1 ] and [ finitesize ] ( right panels ) , to be compared with their corresponding left panels .",
    "in this paper we studied a toy model of heat transport between two thermal baths at different temperatures .",
    "the model is simple enough so the exact current large deviation function can be analytically calculated , as well as the full system statistics associated to a large deviation event . in this way we find a relation between system statistics at the end of the large deviation event and for intermediate times , which shows that important configurations at intermediate times are those with a significant probabilistic weight at the end of both the large deviation event and its time - reversed process .",
    "thus midtime statistics turns out to be independent of the sign of the current , a reflection of the time - reversal symmetry of microscopic dynamics , while endtime statistics does depend on the current sign , and also on the microscopic definition of the current .",
    "the relation between midtime and endtime statistics is a general property for systems obeying the local detailed balance condition , which guarantees the time - reversibility of the dynamics .",
    "we also compared our exact results with simulation data to analyze the range of validity of a recently proposed computational scheme to directly evaluate large deviation functions .",
    "this comparison offers insights into the finite - size corrections associated to this simulation method .",
    "in particular , we were able to calculate the range of validity of the numerical results for our simplified model , finding that this range grows logarithmically with the number of clones involved in the evaluation of the current large deviation function .",
    "we conjecture that such slow growth , which impedes in practice obtaining reliable results for extreme current fluctuations , is a general feature of the simulation method .",
    "finally , for more general systems for which we do not know the analytical form of the large deviation function , we show that violations of the gallavotti - cohen symmetry can be used to bound the range of validity of numerical results .",
