    "in the search for the origins of ultra  high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , a variety of strategies have been employed to detect deviations from isotropy in event arrival directions .",

    "galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields are expected to produce large perturbations in the arrival directions of charged particles : a proton of energy @xmath0  ev may be deflected by several tens of degrees as it traverses the disk of the milky way galaxy , with a typical magnetic field of order 1  microgauss  @xcite .",
    "a compact arrival direction excess at these energies would therefore suggest neutral primaries .",
    "neutrons however possess a lifetime of @xmath3 seconds at @xmath0  ev , and therefore can not have originated more than 30 kpc from earth .",

    "we count the fraction of bins @xmath21 having a @xmath18 value greater than some threshold @xmath22 . the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath22 are chosen to optimize the signal size , and a cut is chosen on the fraction @xmath21 which reduces the false positive probability to an acceptable level .",

    "an attempt is then made to reconstruct the monte carlo event with the profile  constrained fitting technique .",
