    "gauge theories with groups larger than su(3 ) , or with light fermions in representations higher than the fundamental , are a staple of theories that go beyond the standard model @xcite . among the mechanisms proposed to connect these theories to the standard model at low energies are technicolor @xcite and tumbling @xcite , with many associated variants .",
    "both of these depend largely on weak - coupling pictures for their dynamics : a perturbative @xmath2 function to take technicolor from weak to strong coupling as the energy scale drops , and a most - attractive - channel argument for scale separation and selection of the condensed channel in tumbling .",
    "nonperturbative tests of these pictures are long overdue . while some lattice studies have been carried out on su(3 ) gauge theories with @xmath3 fundamental flavors @xcite , scant attention has been paid to more general alternatives where a richer set of phenomena may be sought  @xcite .",
    "a number of ideas focus on the behavior of the gauge theory s @xmath2 function and the possibility of an ir - attractive fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the infrared limit of the massless theory is then scale - invariant and probably conformal , devoid of confinement and of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the near - appearance of a fixed point makes the @xmath2 function hover near the axis without crossing it ; this is the scenario of `` walking ''  @xcite , wherein enormous scale ratios are generated before confinement finally sets in at large distances .",
    "let us describe the perturbative picture of the theory we have studied .",
    "this is the su(3 ) gauge theory with @xmath4 fermions in the symmetric two - index representation @xcite , which for this group is the sextet .",
    "consider varying @xmath4 upwards from zero . at",
    "first , the one- and two - loop terms in the @xmath2 function  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are both negative : this is like ordinary qcd .",
    "when @xmath4 passes @xmath7 , the two - loop coefficient in the @xmath2 function becomes positive and hence the two - loop @xmath2 function acquires a zero at positive coupling @xmath8 . for the @xmath9 theory studied in this paper ,",
    "this zero is at the very large coupling @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath4 grows @xmath11 becomes weaker , lending perhaps more credibility to the perturbative prediction @xcite .",
    "it should be kept in mind , though , that when one - loop and two - loop effects compete , there are usually similar - size contributions coming from higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "an infrared fixed point generally requires nonperturbative confirmation .",
    "we have begun a study of the su(3 ) lattice theory with @xmath9 wilson fermions in the sextet representation . since the @xmath2 function gives the most direct approach to all these scenarios , we chose it as our first object of study .",
    "we apply the schrdinger functional ( sf ) method @xcite , wherein we impose a background gauge field and calculate directly the running coupling as the scale of the background field is changed .",
    "since we change the scale by a discrete amount , we obtain the discrete beta function ( dbf ) , analogous to the usual @xmath2 function .",
    "we find that the dbf of the massless theory crosses zero at @xmath12 , far short of the perturbative prediction .",
    "if the full renormalization - group flow of the theory can indeed be summed up by this single coupling constant , then this is an ir - attractive fixed point , implying scale invariance in the ir physics of the strictly massless lattice theory defined in the fixed point s catchment basin . at the same time , the zero of the dbf allows for more complex possibilities stemming from more complex rg flows , as discussed below .    in order to judge the significance of the zero of the dbf , as well as to study the physics of the theory in its vicinity ,",
    "we have also calculated observables connected with the @xmath13 potential and with chiral symmetry . while our presentation here is brief , we wish to place it in its proper context .",
    "a simple and general argument shows that the formation of any bound states made out of light fermions in a gauge theory ( without scalars ) necessitates the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "thus , if the infrared limit is a confining theory , chiral symmetry must be broken spontaneously at an energy scale at least as high as the confinement scale  @xcite .",
    "if the two scales are indeed separated , the intermediate region breaks chiral symmetry but does not show confinement ; and an entirely nonconfining theory can still break chiral symmetry spontaneously . a conformal theory , on the other hand , is inconsistent with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry since the breaking creates a mass scale .",
    "in order to introduce the sf running coupling @xmath14 , we begin with the gauge theory defined in a small euclidean box of volume @xmath15 .",
    "we can consistently choose the coupling in this volume to be small ; asymptotic freedom ensures that there is only one effective coupling , that it runs with the perturbative @xmath2 function , and hence that at yet smaller distances , the coupling is even smaller . in determining the running coupling _",
    "non_-perturbatively , virtually any observable can in principle be used to extract it . for consistency",
    ", we require that a perturbative calculation of the same observable will indeed reproduce the running coupling at this small scale .    the sf definition of the running coupling @xmath14 is an application of the background field method .",
    "consider a background field calculation in the classical field strength @xmath16 . if by construction the only distance scale that characterizes the background field is @xmath17 , the @xmath18-loop effective action @xmath19 gives the running coupling via @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath14 is the result of integrating the @xmath18-loop @xmath2 function .",
    "the sf defines the background field by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary values are chosen such that the classical action has a unique , nontrivial minimum , and the configuration at this minimum is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the effective action @xmath24 is then calculated and compared via eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to @xmath25 , which in turn is to be evaluated for the classical field that minimizes it with the given boundary conditions .",
    "if the effective action is calculated nonperturbatively , this procedure gives a nonperturbative definition of @xmath14 .    at short distances ,",
    "the static potential between color sources is a coulomb potential .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath26 provides a small correction .",
    "we postulate that this is true when the volume is small enough that confinement is not evident .",
    "in large volumes , on the other hand , the static potential can be qualitatively different ; the notion of a unique effective coupling that depends only on the overall scale may no longer be tenable .",
    "the upshot is that one must be cautious in drawing conclusions from the running of a single coupling constant .",
    "we bear this in mind as we take eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to define of @xmath14 beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the continuum framework carries over to the lattice with minor adaptations .",
    "a technical obstacle is that monte carlo methods do not allow for the direct computation of the effective action .",
    "this is solved by considering a family of gauge - field boundary values that depend on a continuous parameter @xmath27 . by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) we obtain @xmath28 the derivative of @xmath24 gives an observable quantity , while @xmath29 is just a number @xcite .",
    "our lattice theory is defined by the single - plaquette gauge action and a wilson fermion action with added clover term  @xcite .",
    "our choice of @xmath9 ensures positivity of the fermion determinant , which in turn allows use of the standard hybrid monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we eschew perturbative corrections @xcite to the parameters and operators in this exploratory study , but we do modify the clover term s coefficient via self - consistent tadpole improvement , @xmath30 . the quantum correction @xmath31 is known to be nonperturbative and large for fundamental fermions @xcite , where it serves to bring the theory closer to the continuum limit ; the tadpole estimate supplies a large portion of the correction .",
    "the sf boundary conditions take the form of fixed , spatially constant values for the spacelike links @xmath32 on the top and bottom layers of the lattice .",
    "these links enter into the gauge plaquette and into the clover term of the fermion action .",
    "thus the @xmath27 derivative of the effective action is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the complete wilson - clover fermion action .",
    "( the appearance of @xmath35 indicates that @xmath9 ; we evaluate the functional trace with a noisy estimator @xcite . )",
    "the boundary fields are chosen as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the parameter @xmath27 enters linearly into phase angles so the derivatives on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deta ] ) are implemented by putting the appropriate fixed values in place of the boundary links @xcite . with these boundary values",
    "the coefficient sites .",
    "there is a tiny dependence on the lattice size , which we safely neglect . ]",

    "we study herein the scaling of only the massless theory . in the case of wilson fermions , where the quark mass is unprotected against additive renormalization",
    ", this means fixing the hopping parameter to its critical value , @xmath47 , at each value of the bare lattice coupling @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to locate @xmath49 when sf boundary conditions are used , since these boundary conditions ( and the spatial twists ) limit the condition number of the fermion matrix even when there is no mass , and hence we can carry out simulations precisely at @xmath50 . a straightforward way of finding @xmath50 is to calculate the quark mass as defined by the lattice approximation of an axial ward identity ( awi ) , @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the time component of the local axial vector current with flavor @xmath53 , taken at zero spatial momentum on the time slice @xmath54 ; @xmath55 is the local pseudoscalar density . the operator @xmath56 is defined by introducing spatially constant ( grassmann ) dirichlet boundary conditions for the fermions , differentiating with respect to these boundary values , and finally setting them to zero @xcite .",

    "in addition , we neglect the mixing of @xmath59 with @xmath60 , which is known to be a small effect for fundamental fermions @xcite .",
    "we list the values of @xmath50 and the tadpole coefficient @xmath61 in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "[ fig : beta ] ]    for an indication of the dependence of the result on the lattice spacing @xmath44 , we have carried out a parallel calculation of @xmath81 with @xmath46 .",

    "we have also carried out calculations on lattices of volume @xmath84 for @xmath85 and  12 with ordinary boundary conditions , at several values of @xmath86 in the same range of @xmath2 .",
    "these calculations show that @xmath87 , with @xmath47 , lies well on the weak - coupling side of the finite - volume crossover associated with confinement physics : the average polyakov loop is large and the static @xmath13 potential is entirely coulombic in the range allowed by the volume .",
    "this means that the lattices of size @xmath88 are not large enough to contain the physics of confinement . as discussed above , this is essential for interpreting @xmath14 as an effective coupling that characterizes the theory .    by qcd standards ,",
    "a coupling @xmath89 is perturbative .",
    "this is in line with the lack of confinement in our @xmath73 lattices .",
    "nevertheless , this coupling may not be weak when considering the possibility of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for higher - representation fermions .",
    "indeed , a quenched study with color - sextet fermions found that the finite - temperature chiral transition occurs at @xmath90 with @xmath91 , a far larger @xmath2 value than that of the deconfinement transition @xcite . with our dynamical fermions , however , things are different . on lattices with @xmath92 sites , with @xmath85 , we find the chiral restoration crossover at @xmath66 close to , but definitely below @xmath49 .",
    "thus the coupling at the zero of the dbf does nt break chiral symmetry either .",
    "the simplest explanation of the zero of the dbf is that the strictly massless theory with two color - sextet fermions has an infrared - attractive fixed point , leading to conformal physics without chiral symmetry breaking and without confinement .",
    "accepting this conclusion , a major goal of further lattice studies would be to understand the behavior of the same theory at nonzero fermion mass . in a truly conformal theory ,",
    "the introduction of a fermion mass provides the only scale ; that scale can sometimes play the role of an effective ultraviolet cutoff , and sometimes the role of an infrared cutoff .",
    "this is an unfamiliar territory that contains many interesting questions .",
    "our results clearly do not allow for a continuum extrapolation .",
    "more lattice volumes are needed , and it is also desirable to compute the dbf for more scale ratios . such detailed information would allow the reconstruction of a continuous @xmath2 function .",
    "appelquist , fleming , and neil @xcite have recently presented an extensive sf analysis of the su(3 ) gauge theory with @xmath93 and  12 flavors of fundamental fermions .",
    "their results are based on larger statistics as well as a detailed continuum extrapolation .",
    "this allows them to conclude with certainty that the @xmath94 theory has an infrared fixed point .    our results for",
    "the dbf of the color - sextet theory do not preclude more elaborate scenarios whereby the dynamics generates new effective degrees of freedom at some nonperturbative scale .",
    "this would typically lead to new relevant and/or marginal couplings ; our single - parameter dbf would result from projecting the multiparameter rg flow into a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "a concrete scenario in this direction was proposed by one of us in ref .",
    "one supposes that chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously when the interaction is still coulombic .",
    "this allows for the existence of colored excitations .",
    "the fermion condensate is then polarized in response to an applied color field .",
    "as we move down in energy scale across the chiral transition , the effective gauge coupling is screened by the collective response of the fermion condensate .",
    "this effect , if found , would be the relativistic counterpart of the familiar dielectric polarization .",
    "the scenario is described by an effective lagrangian that indeed contains new couplings @xcite . for a short while",
    ", the running of the gauge coupling _ reverses its direction _ from that of an asymptotically free theory ; a discrete sampling of this running can result in a zero of the dbf , imitating a fixed point .",
    "whatever the scenario , our dbf flatly contradicts continuum perturbative estimates . if confirmed by a true scaling study",
    ", it would show that this theory is not like qcd with a small number of fundamental fermions , where the beta function is always negative ; and it is not like theories where the fermions condense and decouple from the gauge fields , since in that case the beta function would behave as if @xmath95 , becoming even more negative than that of the fully coupled theory . the simplest explanation of our dbf is still an infrared - attractive fixed point , at an unexpectedly weak coupling .",
    "this would place the massless theory squarely in the conformal window : it would prevent confinement and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , and remove the theory from the list of candidates for walking .",
    "we thank f.  sannino and r.  hoffmann for discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us department of energy and by the israel science foundation under grant no .",
