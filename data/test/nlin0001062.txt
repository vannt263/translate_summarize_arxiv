    "it is generally assumed that diffusion in macroscopic systems is a result of chaos on a microscopic scale , following einstein s 1905 explanation for brownian motion , that is , the movement of a colloidal particle due to thermal fluctuations in the surrounding fluid .",
    "we describe chaos , diffusion and related properties in detail in sec .",
    "[ s : fund ] .",
    "we define microscopic chaos ( usually shortened to just `` chaos '' ) in terms of unpredictability as quantified by positive lyapunov exponents or a positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy ; later we will find that properties based on periodic orbits also provide a useful description of chaotic aspects of the microscopic dynamics . note that we restrict the use of the term `` chaotic '' to its usual meaning , that is a positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy ; while the properties of periodic orbits are important , we do not classify systems as chaotic or nonchaotic based on these properties .",
    "we call a system diffusive when the mean square displacement of a particle is proportional to the time , or a distribution of particles satisfies the diffusion equation",
    ".    a recent experiment of gaspard et al  @xcite , described below , purports to show that the diffusion of a brownian particle is due to microscopic chaos . while we believe that brownian motion ( including both the brownian particle and the solvent ) is most likely chaotic , our simulations using nonchaotic models , in a brief comment  @xcite and in greater detail here lead to the same results as found in the experiment , so that no experimental proof of microscopic chaos has been given in  @xcite . here",
    "we explore the question of what kind of experimental measurements or data analysis might be required to identify microscopic chaotic dynamics , and the connection between microscopic chaos and diffusion .",
    "we consider generalizations of models of diffusion due to lorentz and ehrenfest ( figs .",
    "[ f : fix]-[f : lor ] ) , where a single point particle undergoes elastic collisions with a fixed arrangement of circular or square scatterers in two dimensions , respectively .",
    "collisions with the circular scatterers of the ( chaotic ) lorentz gas lead to exponential separation of nearby trajectories , that is , a positive lyapunov exponent , while collisions with the square scatterers of the ( nonchaotic ) ehrenfest model lead to at most linear separation of nearby trajectories , and the lyapunov exponents are all zero .",
    "actually , we consider models with three types of scatterers , all of which are non - overlapping : circles as in the lorentz gas , squares oriented such that their diagonals are parallel to the coordinate axes and with only four particle velocity directions as in the ehrenfest wind - tree model , and squares of arbitrary orientations with arbitrary particle velocity directions as a generalization of the ehrenfest model .",
    "( 280,280)(-50,0 ) ( 40,10 )    ( 280,280)(-50,0 ) ( 40,10 )    ( 280,280)(-50,0 ) ( 40,10 )    for each of these three models , we consider the following three cases : an infinite number of randomly placed fixed scatterers as in the original models of lorentz and ehrenfest , a small number of fixed scatterers in an elementary cell subject to periodic boundary conditions , and an arrangement of a finite number of fixed scatterers enclosed by absorbing boundaries .",
    "note that a model with periodic boundary conditions can be viewed as an infinite periodic system .",
    "for the purposes of studying properties such as the mean free time , it is better to view the model as a finite system with periodic boundaries , but to compute the diffusion coefficient in terms of the growth of the mean square displacement with time , it is necessary to view the model as an infinite periodic system .",
    "a link between chaos and diffusion involves a fundamental question of statistical mechanics , since one has to make a connection between the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of large systems .",
    "the models we consider here are very special from a physical point of view , but very attractive from a mathematical point of view , because there is only one moving particle , rather than a large number as in , for example , brownian motion .",
    "these can be considered bona fide statistical mechanical models if the large number of scatterers are included , as long as their lack of motion is irrelevant to the questions we ask .",
    "we believe that our models incorporate the essential features needed for a discussion of microscopic chaos and diffusion .",
    "we now describe the experiment and analysis of gaspard et al . in more detail .",
    "the position of a brownian particle in a fluid was measured at regular intervals of @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental time series data was then interpreted using standard techniques of chaotic time series analysis , suggesting a positive lower bound on the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , hence microscopic chaos .",
    "the method they used , due to cohen and procaccia  @xcite was adapted from an approach pioneered by grassberger and procaccia  @xcite . in this method one",
    "analyzes the distribution of recurrences , _",
    "i.e. _ instances where the system approximately retraces part of its previous trajectory in phase space for a certain length of time , leading to a determination of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "there is detailed mathematical justification for the method ( under assumptions such as the length of the data set being sufficient to approximate infinite time limits , see sec .",
    "[ s : gp ] ) , but the idea is very simple : recurrences give useful information about the predictability of the system . if long recurrences occur very often , it is easy to predict the future of the system from previous instances similar to the recent part of the trajectory , so the system has a small or zero kolmogorov - sinai entropy , whereas a rapid decay of the frequency with length of the recurrences indicates a high degree of microscopic chaos . thus , the cohen - procaccia method used by gaspard can be used to calculate the kolmogorov - sinai entropy from a time series in principle , but certain mathematical conditions and limits apply , sometimes restricting its applicability in practice .",
    "gaspard et al .",
    "concluded from their analysis that the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of the system containing the brownian particle was positive , and hence that the microscopic dynamics was chaotic .",
    "subsequently , we showed  @xcite that the same approach applied to an `` identical '' time series generated by a numerical simulation of the nonchaotic ( infinite , fixed orientation ) ehrenfest model yielded virtually identical results .",
    "this is surprising , since the collisions with the flat sides of square scatterers do not lead to positive lyapunov exponents , as described above . in ref .",
    "@xcite we attributed the discrepancy to the physical issue of time scales  the time interval between measurements ( @xmath0 ) was vastly greater than the typical collision times of the brownian particle with the solvent particles in the fluid ( approximately @xmath1 ) . while this is certainly an experimental problem , it leaves open the question of whether in principle a similar analysis with a much higher resolution could ever prove from experimental data that the microscopic dynamics is chaotic or not .",
    "one aim of the current work is to shed light on this , and related questions .",
    "we perform the same cohen - procaccia analysis on all the models mentioned above , finding that the same results are obtained even for a model with a periodic array of squares .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the apparently positive value of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy is due to a loss of information associated with the randomness of the many scatterers .",
    "we discuss the relevant time scales in our models , finding a single microscopic time scale , and we can then qualitatively explain the results of the cohen - procaccia algorithm when the time step is shorter or longer than this time . we conclude that due to the rarity of recurrences in a diffusive system , the determination of chaoticity in such a system requires vastly longer time series than are practical for experimental or computational work , even when the measurements are taken at microscopic time and distance scales .    at that point",
    "we return to the question of how microscopic dynamics manifests itself in a time series , as well as in the macroscopic behavior .",
    "we develop a new method which we call `` almost periodic recurrences '' that selects a particular class of recurrences different from those used in the cohen - procaccia method .",
    "our approach is designed to distinguish systems based on their periodic orbit properties , which are related to , but not equivalent to the usual definition of chaos as positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "we find that , in contrast to the cohen - procaccia method , this method can distinguish between the chaotic lorentz model and the nonchaotic ehrenfest model and thus reveals at least one way in which microscopic chaos is manifest , although on macroscopic scales both models exhibit diffusion .",
    "the basic idea of our method is simple : almost periodic recurrences are related to periodic orbits which have very different properties in chaotic and nonchaotic systems , so a search for periodic orbits using recurrences may distinguish between the two classes of systems .",
    "the periodic orbits of chaotic systems ( such as the lorentz gas ) are exponentially unstable , so many repetitions close to a periodic orbit are unlikely . in contrast , the periodic orbits of nonchaotic systems ( for example our wind - tree models ) can be power law unstable , allowing many repetitions .",
    "the markedly different properties of periodic orbits in the lorentz and ehrenfest models leads to the following important observations about diffusion in finite geometries .",
    "solutions of the diffusion equation with absorbing boundaries exhibit exponential decay , corresponding to the probability of a particle remaining in the system for a given time .",
    "the randomly oriented wind - tree model has periodic orbits with power law escape , so that the escape from the whole system can not be exponential at long times .",
    "the fixed orientation wind - tree model has no periodic orbits at all , so the particle can not remain in the system longer than a fixed maximum time .",
    "both of these are examples of situations in which the infinite model satisfies the diffusion equation by having a gaussian distribution with the mean square displacement proportional to the time , but the corresponding finite model does not satisfy the diffusion equation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : first we introduce our models ( sec .  [",
    "s : mod ] ) , and discuss in detail their relevant time scales and chaotic and diffusive properties ( sec .",
    "[ s : fund ] ) .",
    "then we discuss the cohen - procaccia method and its inability to distinguish chaotic from nonchaotic dynamics in our case ( sec .",
    "[ s : gp ] ) .",
    "finally we introduce our alternative `` almost periodic recurrence '' method and discuss the properties of the periodic orbits ( sec .",
    "[ s : isr ] ) , and their consequences for finite systems ( sec .",
    "[ s : esc ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results and some open questions ( sec.[s : conc ] ) .",
    "the ehrenfest wind - tree model describes a point `` wind '' particle moving in straight lines in the plane punctuated by elastic collisions with fixed square scatterers , the `` trees '' . in the original model ( fig .",
    "[ f : fix ] ) , the trees are oriented with their diagonals along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes , and the wind particle moves with a fixed velocity in only four possible directions , along these axes .",
    "the trees are located at random positions , with a given number density , and not overlapping .",
    "there is an overlapping version we will not consider ; it exhibits anomalous ( sub)-diffusion and non - gaussian distributions  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we consider the case of randomly oriented scatterers ( fig .",
    "[ f : ran ] ) , which allows all possible wind particle directions . in both the fixed and randomly oriented cases all lyapunov exponents are zero , because a collision from a flat scatterer causes only a linear separation of nearby trajectories ; it does not cause the exponential separation associated with convex curved scatterers .",
    "thirdly , we consider the ( two dimensional ) lorentz gas ( fig .",
    "[ f : lor ] ) , that is , a model where the scatterers are circular , and we choose the area and number density of the scatterers to correspond to the wind - tree models .",
    "this model is known to have normal diffusive properties  @xcite and is used here as a comparison to examine the effects of positive versus zero lyapunov exponents .      for the numerical simulations , we take the velocity of the wind particle to be @xmath4 . for the wind - tree models we take the side length @xmath5 equal to @xmath6 .",
    "this is done for computational convenience ; space is divided into unit squares ( of side length 1 ) aligned with the coordinate axes , so that at most one scatterer can be contained in each unit square . for the lorentz gas",
    "the circular scatterers have a radius @xmath7 to give them the same area @xmath8 as the squares . in all cases",
    "the total area considered has a number of unit squares , @xmath9 , up to @xmath10 in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions , and periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "to simulate an infinite system , a large value of @xmath9 ( up to 3500 ) is used ; for the maximum time of @xmath11 time units the particle never travels far enough to sample the periodic boundary conditions . to simulate a periodic system , a small size such as @xmath12",
    "is used ; we always consider the case of finite horizon , so that the time between collisions is bounded . to simulate a system with absorbing boundaries , an intermediate size such as @xmath13",
    "is used ; the absorbing boundaries are one distance unit inside the edge of the system to avoid the possibility of the particle colliding with a scatterer as well as with its periodic image .",
    "we use a number of scatterers @xmath14 equal to @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the number density @xmath16 is @xmath17 in all cases and the proportion of the total area covered by the scatterers is @xmath18 .",
    "thus we have an intermediate density of scatterers , which is most convenient from the point of view of the simulations and also the time scales . for a significantly lower density ,",
    "an infinite horizon is much more likely in all but the largest systems . for a significantly higher density ( limited by a maximum of @xmath19 ) the metropolis algorithm ( see below ) used to position the scatterers is very much slower .",
    "also , both for low and high density systems , there is an additional time scale ( see section  [ s : time ] ) , which complicates the analysis .",
    "we now describe the method used to position the fixed scatterers .",
    "each configuration of random positions and orientations is obtained from a version of the metropolis algorithm , used in  @xcite .",
    "the square scatterers of the wind - tree models are placed initially at points belonging to a square lattice defined such that they do not overlap , that is , with their centers at integer coordinates @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is even , and their orientation as in fig .",
    "[ f : fix ] .",
    "not every lattice site is then occupied , depending on the number density .",
    "each scatterer is shifted and rotated a small random amount in turn , typically a few tenths of a distance unit and of order ten degrees respectively .",
    "if the shift causes an overlap , the move is rejected and the previous configuration is used .",
    "the procedure is repeated with different shifts and rotations .",
    "a large fixed number of shifts are attempted , sufficient for reasonable measures of the correlation between scatterers to have long converged to their final values .    if the circles of the lorentz gas are placed on the same lattice as the squares they overlap slightly",
    "; at the chosen density of @xmath22 there is enough freedom to allow them to find non - overlapping locations , so that the final configuration is non - overlapping , as we could check . at higher densities circles",
    "may not find non - overlapping locations , and a close packed triangular lattice should then be used instead .",
    "we now define the notation we will use to distinguish between the various models .",
    "there are a very large number of possible parameters that could appear in general , referring to the shape of the scatterers ( squares , circles , etc . ) , different densities and different shaped boundary conditions to name a few , but for conciseness we limit the notation to include only those models we use here , in particular keeping the areal density always at @xmath22 . using square brackets [ , ] to denote different cases ,",
    "our notation is [ f , r , l][@xmath23,[p , a]@xmath9 ] .",
    "the first symbol [ f , r , l ] denotes the type and orientation of the scatterers , f for fixed oriented squares , r for randomly oriented squares and l for circles ( the lorentz gas ) .",
    "the next symbol [ @xmath23,p , a ] gives information about the boundary conditions , either @xmath23 , that is , no boundaries , or p for periodic boundary conditions or a for absorbing boundaries .",
    "the symbols p and a are followed by the size of the system , @xmath9 , which is an even integer .",
    "thus the original ehrenfest model is denoted f@xmath23 , while a periodic lorentz gas with @xmath25 ( containing @xmath26 scatterers at the density used in our simulations ) is denoted lp8 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : lor ] ) .",
    "the latter model is generated by random shifts of the scatterers as above , ensuring that periodic images of the scatterers do not overlap .",
    "when no confusion can arise , we will sometimes refer to classes of models with a simplified notation , for example we denote all randomly oriented wind - tree models as r , and all lorentz models with absorbing boundaries as la .",
    "this section collects a number of fundamental properties and results that form a basis for sections  [ s : gp ] ,  [ s : isr ] and  [ s : esc ] .",
    "first we consider the important issue of _ time scales _ , which puts the time series analysis methods of sections  [ s : gp ] and  [ s : isr ] into a physical context .",
    "then we consider _ chaotic properties _ , giving known results and conjectures for our models ; all of the following sections use this .",
    "after this we study _ diffusive properties _",

    "these are of direct importance to sec .",
    "[ s : esc ] ; the time series analysis methods are applied only to our diffusive models , . ] but the diffusion is somewhat incidental as the methods can be applied to arbitrary time series . at the end of this section",
    "we relate the chaotic and diffusive properties of our models .",
    "one of our difficulties of the gaspard et al experiment  @xcite is that the interval between their measurements ( 1/60 s ) is so much greater than the relevant time scale ( @xmath1 ) of the dynamics , that is the time interval determined by collisions between the brownian particle and the other particles in the fluid .",
    "it is thus important to clarify the issue of what time scales are relevant in our models , so that the simulation results can be put in context .",
    "there are three relevant time scales here , the time taken for the particle to traverse the length of a scatterer ( defined to be of order one time unit ; see sec .",
    "[ s : comp ] ) , the mean free time between collisions @xmath27 , and the time at which the particle begins to notice the finite size @xmath9 of the system ( when it is not infinite ) .",
    "it turns out ( see sec .  [",
    "s : diff ] ) that all the random and periodic models except fp have a well defined diffusion coefficient @xmath28 , so in these cases the time taken to reach the boundary is of order @xmath29 .",
    "the mean free time can be calculated exactly ( see the appendix ) and is given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the f , r , and l models respectively , independent of the size of the system ( ignoring the case of absorbing boundaries ) .",
    "we have checked these values numerically , and the results agree within their uncertainties of about @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that all the time scales in these models are of order one time unit , except those defined by the boundary .",
    "this means that a time step of one time unit should be sufficient to observe effects due to the microscopic chaos in the time series analysis methods of sections  [ s : gp ] and  [ s : isr ] .",
    "we began with the notion of microscopic chaos as the presence of a positive lyapunov exponent arising from collisions with strictly convex scatterers , or as a positive kolmogorov - sinai entropy quantifying the lack of predictability of a chaotic system .",

    "we have explored the connections between microscopic chaos and diffusion . on a superficial level ,",
    "the details of the microscopic dynamics seem to have little effect on the diffusion process : gaussian diffusion is observed in our rp4 model , which has scatterers with flat sides ( hence no exponential separation of nearby trajectories ) and is periodic ( hence there is no source of randomness from a disordered environment ) .",
    "in addition , the grassberger - procaccia method of time series analysis can not distinguish our chaotic and nonchaotic diffusive models because it would require impractically long data sets . on a deeper level , however , the subtle differences between chaotic and nonchaotic diffusion are quite apparent if you know where to look : our time series analysis method based on periodic orbits has no trouble distinguishing between the chaotic and nonchaotic models , and the long time behavior of escape from an open system is also determined by the properties of the chaotic versus nonchaotic periodic orbits .    in the light of our results , we can make a few concrete suggestions for an experimental determination of the chaotic or nonchaotic properties in a diffusive system .",
    "firstly , as we remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is necessary to make measurements on the distance and time scales relevant to the microscopic dynamics . in our models ,",
    "this question is simplified by the fact that all microscopic time scales are of order one in our units , sec .",
    "[ s : time ] .",
    "once this is achieved , one could use an approach based on the method of almost periodic recurrences , which searches for periodic behavior ; alternatively the late time decay of particles from an open system can also elicit the chaotic or nonchaotic nature of the dynamics .",
    "this raises again the question of exactly what dynamical properties would be measured ; there are systems with the positive ks entropy of the lorentz gas as well as the power law unstable periodic orbits of the wind - tree models .",
    "we will now make some remarks about such systems , although we make no attempt to enumerate all degrees and classes of chaotic dynamics .",
    "our example in this discussion is a model containing both circular and randomly oriented square scatterers .",
    "the circular scatterers lead , as in the lorentz gas , to a positive lyapunov exponent , while the square scatterers lead , as in the randomly oriented wind - tree model , to power law unstable periodic orbits , using the same argument as in sec .",
    "[ s : npo ] .",
    "we have not simulated such a model numerically ; however the arguments used in the previous sections may be applied , leading to the following predictions :    sec .",

    "s : esc ] : such a system with absorbing boundaries will exhibit power law escape at long times , again due to the periodic orbits , as in the r model .",
    "the different conclusions reached by the gp and apr methods exemplify the fact that these methods are based on different dynamical properties ; for diffusion in an open system , it is clear that the mixed model is most similar to the r model , and hence that the apr method distinguishes the relevant dynamical property in this case .",
    "we conclude with some open questions and possibilities for further work . in terms of _",
    "microscopic chaos _",
    ", we have studied only a few models .",
    "we note that there are examples of lack of chaoticity we have not considered , such as the coexistence of chaotic and nonchaotic regions found in kam theory . in terms of _ diffusion _ , we note that in the light of sec .",
    "[ s : esc ] the diffusion equation is not a complete macroscopic description of nonchaotic diffusion . in terms of _ time series analysis _ , our apr method , while sufficient for our purposes here , could be much more developed and applied . with regard to _ periodic orbit theory _",
    ", the methods developed for exploiting the importance of periodic orbits to compute properties of chaotic systems  @xcite do not apply to nonchaotic systems , and yet we have seen that periodic orbits also play an important role in nonchaotic systems .",
    "we note that our infinite models , while sharing some of the properties of corresponding finite billiards , appear to fall outside the domain of current mathematics .",
    "for example , a recent study of infinite billiard systems  @xcite is mostly restricted to cases with finite areas that are finitely connected ; our models obey neither of these conditions .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it is possible to rigorously determine the status of our models , particularly their ergodic properties , rate of decay of correlations and kolmogorov - sinai entropy within the framework of some mathematical theory of infinite nonchaotic systems .",
    "more generally , a mathematical understanding of statistical mechanics including the thermodynamic limit naturally leads to the study of infinite systems .",
    "finally , we remark that all the models we have considered  with the exception of one ( fp4 )  are diffusive , limiting our investigation as to the presence of microscopic chaos or not to such systems .",
    "in addition , the precise role played by microscopic chaos  as represented by the lyapunov exponents  and `` macroscopic chaos '' , as embodied by the randomly placed scatterers for the existence of a diffusion process and the value of the diffusion coefficient , remains open .",
    "a similar but more complicated situation obtains when diffusion of momentum ( viscosity ) or energy ( heat conduction ) and other transport processes are considered .",
