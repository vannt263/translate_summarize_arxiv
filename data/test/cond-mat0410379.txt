    "many networks in nature and technology are sparse , _",
    "i.e. _ , the average node degree is much smaller than the total number of nodes @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "widely studied classes of networks , such as regular grids , random graphs , and scale - free networks , are maximally sparse , as the average node degree remains finite as @xmath1 . however , in other examples of real sparse networks , such as the internet , the average node degree grows , albeit very slowly , with system size .",
    "motivated by this observation , we introduce a simple network growth mechanism of copying that naturally generates sparse networks in which the average node degree diverges logarithmically with system size .",
    "we dub these log - networks .",
    "related results appear in previous investigations of related models @xcite , while models where a slowly increasing ratio of links to nodes is imposed externally have also been considered @xcite .    to motivate the copying mechanism for log - networks let us recall the growing network with redirection ( gnr ) @xcite .",
    "the gnr is built by adding nodes according to the following simple rule .",
    "each new node initially selects an earlier `` target '' node at random . with a specified probability a link from the new node to the target node",
    "is created ; with a complementary probability , the link is re - directed to the ancestor node of the target . although the target node is chosen randomly , the redirection mechanism generates an effective preferential attachment because a high - degree node is more likely to be the ancestor of a randomly - selected node . by this feature",
    ", redirection leads to a power - law degree distribution for the network .",
    "the gnr thus provides an appealingly simple mechanism for preferential attachment , as well as an extremely efficient way to simulate large scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "the growing network with redirection is a simplification of a previous model @xcite which was proposed to mimic the copying of links in the world - wide web . in this web model ,",
    "a new node links to a randomly - chosen target node and also to its ancestor nodes ( subject to a constraint on the maximum number of links created ) . in the context of citations ,",
    "copying is ( regrettably ) even more natural , as it is easier merely to copy the references of a cited paper , rather than to look at the original references @xcite .",
    "as the literature grows , the copying mechanism will necessarily lead to later publications having more references than earlier publications .    in the following sections , we analyze a growing network model with copying ( gnc ) .",
    "we consider a model with no global bound on the number of links emanating from a new node .",
    "we shall see that this simple copying mechanism generates log - networks .",
    "we will use the master equation approach to derive basic geometric properties of the network .",
    "we then compare our prediction about the logarithmic growth of the average degree with data from physical review citations .",
    "we now define the gnc model precisely .",
    "the network grows by adding nodes one at a time .",
    "a newly - introduced node randomly selects a target node and links to it , as well as to all ancestor nodes of the target node ( fig .",
    "[ c ] ) .",
    "if the target node is the initial root node , no additional links are generated by the copying mechanism .",
    "if the newly - introduced node were to always choose the root node as the target , a star graph would be generated .",
    "on the other hand , if the target node is always the most recent one in the network , all previous nodes are ancestors of the target and the copying mechanism would give a complete graph .",
    "correspondingly , the total number of links @xmath2 in a network of @xmath0 nodes can range from @xmath3 ( star graph ) to @xmath4 ( complete graph ) .",
    "notice also that the number of outgoing links from each new node ( the out - degree ) can range between 1 and the current number of nodes .",
    "we now study geometric properties of the gnc model by the master equation approach .",
    "we determine how the total number of links @xmath5 grows with @xmath0 , as well as the in - degree , out - degree , and the joint in / out - degree distributions .",
    "let @xmath6 be the average value of the total number of links in a network of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "if a newly - introduced node selects a target node with @xmath7 ancestors , then the number of links added to the network will be @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the average total number of links satisfies @xmath9 the factor @xmath10 in the first line assures that a target node @xmath11 is selected uniformly from among all @xmath0 nodes , and we obtain the second line by employing the sum rule @xmath12 .    dividing eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) by @xmath13 gives @xmath14 and then summing both sides from 1 to @xmath3 gives the solution @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the harmonic number .",
    "( for concreteness , we assume that the network starts with a single node , so that @xmath17 . )   using the asymptotics of the harmonic numbers @xcite we find @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the euler constant .",
    "the leading asymptotic behavior of @xmath20 can also be obtained more easily from eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) by taking the continuum approximation and solving the resulting differential equation .     for @xmath21 realizations of a gnc of @xmath22 sites .",
    "shown are both the raw data and the result of averaging the data over a 1% range . for this value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the mean number of links is 6485.56 , while eq .",
    "( [ ln - sol - asymp ] ) gives 6485.47  .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    thus we conclude that the average degree of the network grows logarithmically with the system size ; that is , the copying mechanism generates a log - network .",
    "this simple phenomenon is one of our major results .",
    "we now briefly discuss the probability distribution of the total number of links @xmath23 for a network of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "simulations show that the distribution is asymmetric and quite broad ( fig .",
    "[ pl ] ) . to understand the origin of the asymmetry , notice that both the extreme cases of the star graph ( @xmath24 ) and the complete graph ( @xmath25 ) each occur with probability @xmath26 because each new node must select one specific target node",
    ". therefore the distribution of the total number of links vanishes much more sharply near the lower cutoff .    near the peak however , the distribution @xmath23 is symmetric about the average .",
    "more precisely , when the deviation from the average @xmath27 is of the order of @xmath28 ^ 2\\,p_n(l)}$ ] , the distribution approaches a symmetric gaussian shape .",
    "the value of the standard deviation as @xmath1 is @xmath29 as derived in appendix [ ap ] .",
    "the relative width of the distribution is measured by the standard deviation @xmath30 divided by the average @xmath6 ; this ratio approaches zero as @xmath31 when @xmath1 , so that fluctuations die out slowly .",
    "this slow decay of fluctuations explains why the distribution ( fig .  [ pl ] )",
    "remains wide for large @xmath0 and why it looks asymmetric near the peak",
    ".    the gnc model can be extended to allow for wider copying variability .",
    "for example , instead of linking to one initial random target node , we can link to @xmath32 random initial targets .",
    "further , we can link to each target node with probability @xmath33 and to each of the corresponding ancestors with probability @xmath34 . for this general @xmath35 model , the analog of eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) is @xcite @xmath36 which reduces to @xmath37 in the continuum approximation .",
    "the asymptotic growth of the average total number of links crucially depends on the parameter @xmath38 : @xmath39 thus incomplete copying leads to an average node degree that is independent of @xmath0 when @xmath40 , while marginal logarithmic dependence is recovered when @xmath41 .",
    "there is also a pathology for @xmath42 , as the number of links in the network would exceed that of a complete graph with the same number of nodes . in this case",
    ", it is not possible to accommodate all the links specified by the copying rule without having a multigraph , _",
    "i.e. _ , allowing for more than one link between a given pair of nodes .      we now present empirical data from the citation network of physical review to test whether the average degree of these networks grows with time , and if so , whether the growth is consistent with log - networks .",
    "data from all issues of physical review journals is available , encompassing a time span of 110 years @xcite . from this data",
    ", we have the following evidence that citations may be described as a log - network .",
    "specifically , the average number of references in the reference list of each physical review paper grows systematically with time and is consistent with a linear increase ( fig .",
    "[ ref - compare ] ) .",
    "additionally , the number of physical review papers published in a given year roughly grows exponentially with time @xcite .",
    "thus the cumulative number of physical review papers up to a given year also grows exponentially . as a result ,",
    "the number of references should grow logarithmically with the total number of available papers .",
    "this behavior is reasonably consistent with the data of fig .",
    "[ ref - compare ] .    ) . also shown as",
    "a smooth curve is the logarithm of the cumulative number of physical review papers that were published up to each year .",
    "the value 5 is subtracted from the latter data to make the two datasets lie in the same range.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in a related vein , the average number of coauthors per paper has grown slowly with time , due in part , to the growing trend for collaborative research and the continuing ease of long - distance scientific interaction . while co - authorship and other collaboration networks have recently been investigated ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , the analysis has primarily been on network properties at a fixed time .",
    "there is , however , one study of the number of mathematics papers with 1 , 2 , and more authors since 1940 @xcite .",
    "this data shows that the fraction of singly - authored papers is decreasing systematically , while the number of multiple - authored papers is steadily growing .",
    "thus it should be interesting to track the time dependence of the number of co - authors in scientific publications from the current studies of collaboration networks .",
    "interestingly , the internet and the world wide web exhibit certain similarities with log - networks . for example , the total number of links exceeds the total number of nodes in the world wide web by about an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "similarly for the internet , specifically for the autonomous systems ( as ) graph , the average number of links per node is also growing slowly but systematically with time @xcite .",
    "qualitatively these behaviors are consistent with our expectations from log - networks .",
    "it is not still possible to reach definitive conclusions about the precise growth rate on @xmath0 since the available data for the as graph @xcite covers a time period when the total number of ases has increased only by a factor of 4 ( from @xmath43 in 1997 to @xmath44 in 2001 ) .      by its very construction , the links of the gnc network are directed and thus there is an in - degree @xmath45 and an out - degree @xmath7 for each node ( fig .",
    "[ degrees ] ) , and thus two distinct corresponding degree distributions . in this subsection ,",
    "we study the in - degree distribution .",
    "let @xmath46 be the average number of nodes with in - degree @xmath45 in a network consisting of @xmath0 total nodes .",
    "this distribution satisfies @xmath47 the loss term accounts for the following two processes : ( a ) either a node of in - degree @xmath45 , or ( b ) any of its @xmath45 daughter nodes was chosen as the target .",
    "either of these processes leads to the loss of a node with in - degree @xmath45 .",
    "the total loss rate of @xmath46 is thus @xmath48 .",
    "the gain term is explained similarly , and the last term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) describes the effect of the introduction of a new node with no incoming links .",
    "finally , notice that eqs .",
    "( [ pi ] ) hold for @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , there is no longer a loss term and the master equation reduces to @xmath51 .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the root node is necessarily linked to all other nodes and therefore there is one node with degree @xmath3 in a network of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "we compute the in - degree distribution by induction . solving for the first few @xmath46 for small @xmath45 directly",
    ", we find a simple form for the general case that we then check solves the master equation ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "we thus find @xmath52 while @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath55 decay agrees with the logarithmic divergence for the average node degree from the previous section , and perhaps explains the proliferation of exponent values close to 2 for the in - degree distribution that are observed in empirical studies of collaboration networks @xcite and in the world wide web @xcite .",
    "in particular , a comprehensive study by by broder et al .  @xcite reports an exponent value 2.09 , while a recent work by donato et al .",
    "@xcite ( relying on the webbase project at stanford @xcite ) quotes an exponent value 2.1 .      , with nodes arranged in layers left to right according to their out - degree .",
    "the initial layer contains only the root node .",
    "the number of nodes in subsequent layers increases as the network grows .",
    "the initial links are shown as solid arrows and the copied links as dashed arrows.,scaledwidth=32.5% ]    to determine the out - degree distribution , it is helpful to think of the network as a genealogical tree , as illustrated in fig .  [ out ]",
    "( see also @xcite for this construction ) .",
    "initially the network consists of one root node .",
    "subsequent nodes that attach to the root node will have out - degree 1 and lie in the first layer .",
    "similarly , a new node that attaches to a node with out - degree 1 lies in the second layer . by the copying mechanism",
    ", nodes in this second layer also link to the root and therefore have out - degree 2 .",
    "nodes in the @xmath56 layer directly attach to a node in the @xmath57 layer and , by virtue of copying , also attach to one node in every previous layer .",
    "thus @xmath56 layer nodes have out - degree @xmath58 .",
    "we now use this genealogical tree picture to determine the out - degree distribution of the network .",
    "let @xmath59 be the average number of nodes with out - degree @xmath7 in a network consisting of @xmath0 nodes . by definition @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", the number of nodes with out - degree @xmath61 grows each time a node with out - degree @xmath62 is selected as the target node .",
    "the out - degree distribution thus satisfies the master equation @xmath63 this equation applies even for @xmath64 if we set . using the recursive nature of these equations , we first solve for @xmath65 , then @xmath66 , _ etc _ , and ultimately the out - degree distribution for all @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath67 equivalently , we can recast the @xmath7-fold sums into simple sums , although the results look less neat .",
    "for example , @xmath68\\ ] ] where @xmath69 . the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and",
    "other generalized harmonic numbers are known @xcite , and the resulting asymptotics of the out - degree distribution are @xmath72+\\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and analogous results hold for @xmath59 for larger @xmath7 .",
    "if we merely want to establish the leading asymptotic behavior , we can replace the summation in ( [ qj - sol ] ) by integration .",
    "this then leads to the simple result @xmath73 alternatively , we can derive this result within a continuum approach by replacing finite differences by derivatives in the large-@xmath0 limit of eq .",
    "( [ qj ] ) .",
    "the procedure recasts the discrete master equations into the differential equations @xmath74 whose solution is indeed ( [ qj - sol - cont ] ) .",
    "the poisson form of the out - degree distribution contradicts the commonly presumed power - law form .",
    "there is previous literature by broder _",
    "that suggested that the out - degree distribution has a power - law tail , with exponent close to 2.7 @xcite .",
    "however , this work also noted that a power - law is not a good fit to the data and that the out - degree distribution may possibly follow a poisson distribution .",
    "in fact , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite that is based on more recent data on the structure of the web @xcite convincingly shows that a power law does not fit the out - degree distribution .",
    "we define the joint degree distribution @xmath75 as the average number of nodes with in - degree @xmath45 and out - degree @xmath7 in a network of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "the in- and out - degree distributions can then be distilled from the joint distribution via @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , the average number of nodes with total degree @xmath78 is simply given by @xmath79 .",
    "the joint degree distribution satisfies @xmath80 which is an obvious generalization of the governing equations ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ qj ] ) for the separate in- and out - degree distributions .",
    "because of the presence of the last out - degree term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ nij ] ) , the scaling of the joint degree distribution with system size does not hold",
    ". therefore we can not reduce ( [ nij ] ) to an @xmath0-independent recursion .",
    "nevertheless , eqs .",
    "( [ nij ] ) still have the important simplifying feature of being recursive and thus soluble in an inductive fashion .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath82 we have @xmath83 from which @xmath84 for @xmath85 , we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ nij ] ) in the form @xmath86 now the substitution @xmath87 reduces ( [ nij1 ] ) to the constant - coefficient recursion @xmath88 that allows us to express @xmath89 via @xmath90 : @xmath91    from ( [ aij - def ] ) we find @xmath92 which , in conjunction with ( [ n0j ] ) , gives @xmath93 therefore starting with @xmath94 from eq .",

    "( [ aij - sol ] ) by integration .",
    "these two replacements are justified when @xmath98 . finally , using ( [ qj - sol - cont ] ) and after some algebra , we find the leading behavior @xmath99 and more generally @xmath100^{i+1}.\\ ] ] because the poisson form the out - degree distribution holds only when @xmath101 , the generalized poisson form ( [ qj - sol - cont ] ) for the joint degree distribution is also valid only for @xmath102 .    finally , although the total degree distribution @xmath103 does not satisfy a closed equation , we can obtain this distribution indirectly . when @xmath78 is of the order of @xmath104 or smaller , we can use ( [ nij - sol - cont ] ) to find @xmath103 .",
    "the situation in the range @xmath105 is even simpler : in this region , the total degree distribution essentially coincides with the in - degree distribution and therefore @xmath106 ( fig .  [ deg - dist ] ) .",
    "we introduced a growing network model that is based on node addition plus a simple copying mechanism  the gnc  that leads to an average node degree growing logarithmically with the total number of nodes @xmath0 .",
    "this feature may account for the intriguing phenomenon observed in many real networks that the number of links increases slightly faster than the number of nodes .",
    "copying arises naturally in the context of citations ; a not untypical scenario is that an author will be familiar with a few primary references , but may simply copy secondary references from primary ones .",
    "we solved the underlying master equations for the gnc model and showed that the in - degree distribution is a power - law over its entire range , while the out - degree distribution is asymptotically poissonian .",
    "the total degree distribution is consequently a hybrid of the power - law and poisson forms .",
    "there is , on average , one node with total degree equal to 1 , and there is always one node  the root  that has in - degree equal to @xmath3 .",
    "thus the node degree ranges from one to @xmath3 .",
    "since the distribution of @xmath5 has a width that scales linearly with @xmath0 while @xmath6 grows as @xmath20 , fluctuations in node degree are appreciable even for very large networks .",
    "finally , each node is connected to the root , so that the network diameter equals 2 , independent of @xmath0 .    from long - term physical review publication data ,",
    "the average number of references per paper ( the out degree ) grows slowly with the total literature size , consistent with the logarithmic growth predicted by the gnc model .",
    "however , this growth in the gnc model is not robust when parameters that quantify the extent of copying are varied .",
    "the apparent logarithmic growth for the average number of references per paper in the physical review is thus a bit surprising and it will be worthwhile to test whether logarithmic growth arises in a wider range of empirical networks .",
    "in this appendix , we find the variance in the distribution of the number of links @xmath23 .",
    "we start by computing the first two moments of the out - degree distribution , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we then use these results to derive the variance of @xmath23 .    to determine @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    ", we can in principle use eq .",
    "( [ qj - sol ] ) .",
    "however , a direct approach is more useful . starting with @xmath111",
    ", we find that adding a new node leads to the recursion relation @xmath112 which is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ ln ] ) . in a similar manner",
    ", we derive a recursion relation for @xmath113 @xmath114 which reduces to @xmath115 the variance @xmath116 therefore satisfies @xmath117 from this simple recursion we get @xmath118 the relative magnitude of fluctuations die out slowly , as the standard deviation , @xmath119 divided by the average @xmath120 , approaches zero as @xmath121 .",
    "consider now the average number of links in the network @xmath122 and the corresponding second moment @xmath123 .",
    "after the addition of a new node , the second moment changes according to @xmath124 now we use @xmath125 to write the square of eq .",
