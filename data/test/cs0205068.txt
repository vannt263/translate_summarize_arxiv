    "this paper presents a post - mortem analysis of the english and spanish lexical sample tasks of senseval-2 .",
    "two closely related questions are considered . first , to what extent did the competing systems",
    "did systems tend to be redundant and have success with many of the same test instances , or were they complementary and able to disambiguate different portions of the instance space ?",
    "second , how much did the difficulty of the test instances vary ? are there test instances that proved unusually difficult to disambiguate relative to other instances ?",
    "we address the first question via a series of pairwise comparisons among the participating systems that measures their agreement via the kappa statistic .",
    "we also introduce a simple measure of the degree to which systems are complementary called _ optimal combination_. we analyze the second question by rating the difficulty of test instances relative to the number of systems that were able to disambiguate them correctly .",
    "nearly all systems that received official scores in the spanish and english lexical sample tasks of senseval-2 are included in this study .",
    "there are 23 systems included from the english lexical sample task and eight from the spanish .",
    "table [ tab : sum ] lists the systems and shows the number of test instances that each disambiguated correctly , both by part of speech and in total .",

    "if several systems are largely in agreement , then there is little benefit in combining them since they are redundant and will simply reinforce one another .",
    "however , if some systems disambiguate instances that others do not , then they are complementary and it may be possible to combine them to take advantage of the different strengths of each system to improve overall accuracy .    the kappa statistic @xcite is a measure of agreement between multiple systems ( or judges ) that is scaled by the agreement that would be expected just by chance .",

    "an _ optimal combination _ is the accuracy that could be attained by a hypothetical tool called an _ optimal combiner _ that accepts as input the sense assignments for a test instance as generated by several different systems .",
    "it is able to select the correct sense from these inputs , and will only be wrong when none of the sense assignments is the correct one .",
    "thus , the percentage accuracy of an optimal combiner is equal to one minus the percentage of instances that no system can resolve correctly .",
    "of course this is only a tool for thought experiments and is not a practical algorithm .",
    "an optimal combiner can establish an upper bound on the accuracy that could reasonably be attained over a particular sample of test instances .",
    "tables [ tab : eng - opt ] and [ tab : spa - opt ] list the top system pairs ranked by optimal combination ( 1.00 - value in zero column ) for the english and spanish lexical samples .",
    "kappa scores are also shown to illustrate the interaction between agreement and optimal combination .",
    "optimal combination is maximized when the percentage of instances where both systems are wrong is minimized .",
    "kappa agreement is maximized by minimizing the percentage of instances where one or the other system ( but not both ) is correct .",
    "thus , the only way a system pair could have a high measure of kappa and a high measure of optimal combination is if they were very accurate systems that disambiguated many of the same test instances correctly .",
    "system pairs with low measures of agreement are potentially quite interesting because they are the most likely to make complementary errors . for example , in table [ tab : spa - opt ] under nouns , the alicante system has a low level of agreement with all of the other systems . however , the measure of optimal combination is quite high , reaching 0.89 ( 1.00 - 0.11 ) for the pair of alicante and jhu .",
    "in fact , all seven of the other systems achieve their highest optimal combination value when paired with alicante .",
    "this combination of circumstances suggests that the alicante system is fundamentally different than the other systems , and is able to disambiguate a certain set of instances where the other systems fail .",
    "in fact the alicante system is different in that it is the only spanish lexical sample system that makes use of the structure of euro - wordnet , the source of the sense inventory .",
    "the difficulty of disambiguating word senses can vary considerably .",
    "a word with multiple closely related senses is likely to be more difficult than one with a few starkly drawn differences .",
    "in supervised learning , a particular sense of a word can be difficult to disambiguate if there are a small number of training examples available .",
    "table [ tab : instbytrain ] shows the distribution of the number of instances that are successfully disambiguated by a particular number of systems in both the english and spanish lexical samples .",
    "the value under the # column shows the number of systems that are able to disambiguate the number of noun , verb , adjective and total instances shown in the row .",
    "the average number of training examples available for the correct answers associated with these instances is shown in parenthesis .",
    "for example , the first line shows that there were 59 noun instances that no system ( of 23 ) could disambiguate , and that there were on average 16 training examples available for each of the correct senses for these 59 instances .",
    "two very clear trends emerge .",
    "first , there are a substantial number of instances that are not disambiguated correctly by any system ( 262 in english , 228 in spanish ) and there are a large number of instances that are disambiguated by just a handful of systems . in the english lexical sample , there are 1,277 test instances that are correctly disambiguated by five or fewer of the 23 systems .",
    "this is nearly 30% of the test data , and confirms that this was a very challenging set of test instances .",
    "there is also a very clear correlation between the number of training examples available for a particular sense of a word and the number of systems that are able to disambiguate instances of that word correctly .",
    "for example , table 6 shows that there were 174 english verb instances that no system disambiguated correctly . on average",
    "there were only 6 training examples for the correct senses of these instances .",
    "however , there were 28 instances that all 23 english systems were able to disambiguate .",
    "for these instances an average of 47 training examples were available for each correct sense .",
    "this correlation between instance difficulty and number of training examples may suggest that future senseval exercises provide a minimum number of training examples for each sense , or adjust the scoring to reflect the difficulty of disambiguating a sense with very few training examples .",
    "finally , we assess the difficulty associated with word types by calculating the average number of systems that were able to disambiguate the instances associated with that type .",
    "this information is provided for the english and spanish lexical samples in tables [ tab : eng - words ] and [ tab : spa - words ] .",
    "each word is shown with its part of speech , the number of test instances , and the average number of systems that were able to disambiguate each of the test instances .",
    "the verb _ collaborate _ is the easiest according to this metric in the english lexical sample .",
    "it has 30 test instances that were disambiguated correctly by an average of 20.2 of the 23 systems .",
    "the verb _ find _ proves to be the most difficult , with 68 test instances disambiguated correctly by an average of 4.2 systems . a somewhat less extreme range of values is observed for the spanish lexical sample in table [ tab : spa - words ] . the adjective _ claro _ had 66 test instances that were disambiguated correctly by an average of 7.6 of the 8 systems .",
    "the most difficult word was the verb _ conducir _ , which has 54 test instances that were disambiguated correctly by an average of 3.8 systems .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the results from the english and spanish lexical sample tasks of senseval-2 .",
    "the analysis is based on the kappa statistic and a measure known as optimal combination .",
    "it also assesses the difficulty of the test instances in these lexical samples .",
    "we find that there are a significant number of test instances that were not disambiguated correctly by any system , and that there is some correlation between instance difficulty and the number of available training examples .",
