    "are the realization of quantum teleportation @xcite , as well as quantum cryptography protocols , which rely on states defined in a continuous variables representation @xcite .",
    "universality for manipulation of continuous variables quantum states was defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently measurement based quantum computation was generalized from the discrete to the continuous realm @xcite .",
    "manipulating quantum information in continuous or discrete variables , on its usual circuit based formulation , involves the application of unitary gates . while such gates , in the discrete variable ( dv ) case can be expressed in terms of su(2 ) transformations , a general unitary in cv is composed by polynomials of conjugate operators with a continuous unbounded spectrum , such as position and momentum of a particle , or the electromagnetic field quadratures .",
    "even though , in the general case , a direct correspondence between universal operations in dv and cv has not been established , it was shown by gottesman , kitaev and preskill ( gkp ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , that such a correspondence exists for a family of states that , while being defined in cv , can be used to encode a qubit . moreover , the gkp encoding is also at the heart of the demonstration showing that fault - tolerant measurement - based quantum computation with cv cluster states is possible @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this encoding is that it relies on non - physical states .",
    "furthermore , physical states that are close to them are of extremely challenging experimental realization with optical field quadratures . in addition , the gkp encoding has the specific purpose of quantum computation applications . in the more general context of quantum mechanics ,",
    "quantum computing presents the particular aspect of requiring measurements realized in the computational basis only .",
    "however , a number of important quantum mechanics or quantum information related tasks , such as bell inequalities violation @xcite , quantum state tomography @xcite , and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite , rather rely on the recovery of binary information through the measurement of different mutually unbiased bases . for",
    "these applications , one should build a formalism offering an analogy of pauli matrices in phase space not only from the operational point of view , as proposed in @xcite , but also from a measurable perspective .",
    "moreover , in order to build a complete toolbox to manipulate and measure discrete quantum information encoded in cv , one should also define how to perform rotations between different measurement bases .",
    "in the present article we create a framework to manipulate and measure binary quantum information encoded in continuous variables using the formalism of modular variables ( mv ) @xcite , which allows us to naturally identify discrete structures in continuous variable states .",
    "we further introduce adapted operations and observables which enable us to manipulate and readout the encoded discrete quantum information in terms of the corresponding cv logical states .",
    "our formulation shows that , if one is interested in recovering quantum information by measuring binary observables defined in cv , one can loosen the requirements imposed on the gkp states .",
    "our results have immediate experimental impact which we demonstrate by applying them to the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons .",

    "in the modular variables ( mv ) formalism , pairs of canonically conjugate observables are expressed in terms of modular and integer parts , respectively . in the case of the position and momentum operators this leads to @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) has integer eigenvalues , and @xmath4-\\ell/4 $ ] ( @xmath5-\\pi/\\ell$ ] ) is the modular position ( momentum ) operator with eigenvalues in the interval @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ( see fig .",

    "the separation ( [ eq : defmodvar ] ) , in modular and integer parts , proved itself useful for the detection of entanglement in spatial interference patterns @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurements of more general modular variables , namely periodic functions of position and momentum operators , have been used recently in proposals to test the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite , the leggett - garg @xcite and noncontextuality inequalities @xcite .",
    "later on , in sec .",
    "[ sec : readoutmodvar ] , we provide a general framework suitable to deal with measurements of such modular variables based on the above introduced modular representation .",

    "consequently , in terms of the modular basis we can write @xmath19 , with a normalized wave function @xmath20 written in the modular representation . the modular representation is especially convenient when dealing with periodically symmetric states , _",
    "e.g. _ the gkp states . as a matter of fact , using the definition of @xcite and the notation @xmath21 for the logical gkp qubits , one has simply that , in the modular basis : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , showing that the gkp states naturally emerge from the modular basis . a formal definition of the modular basis and related expressions , as well as an example of @xmath20 will be discussed in the next section .",

    "inversely , we can define the position and momentum eigenstates in terms of the new modular eigenstates , as : @xmath34 hence , an arbitrary state in position representation @xmath35 transformed to the modular representation , reads : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is called modular wave function of @xmath38 .",
    "the same representation was introduced by j. zak in 1967 under the term @xmath39-representation @xcite .",
    "the modular variables representation is particularly well suited for wave functions that obey a certain periodicity in position or momentum space .",
    "for example , the state @xmath40 , representing a comb of @xmath31 functions with distance @xmath14 in position space , becomes in the modular representation @xmath41 , namely a single @xmath31 peak at the origin , if we set @xmath42 .",

    "is given by the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) .",
    "labeling quantum states using bounded continuous variables enables the definition of two disjoint sets of equal size for each one of the variables . such a splitting can be done in infinitely many ways , and in order to illustrate the principles of our ideas we discuss in detail the splitting of the domain of the variable @xmath8 into two subintervals @xmath55 and @xmath56 . as a consequence ,",

    "the same functions with switched roles of @xmath77 and @xmath78 represent the logical states @xmath79 . ]      in this section , we introduce some single qubit logical operations acting on the qubit structure ( [ app : eq : contqubitrep2 ] ) that is naturally embedded in every state @xmath38 .",
    "we start by expressing the single mode phase space displacement operator @xmath80 in the modular representation .",
    "to do so , we calculate first its action on a modular eigenstate ( [ app : eq : modvareigenstates ] ) , yielding : @xmath81 over - lined expressions denote the corresponding modular parts in position or momentum , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ app : eq : dispop ] ) shows that a phase space displacement by @xmath82 leads to a displacement of the corresponding modular position and momentum accompanied by the generation of additional phase factors .",
    "the latter encode information about the change of the discrete position and momentum values , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , induced by the displacement .",
    "now , by setting the displacements in eq .",
    "( [ app : eq : dispop ] ) equal @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , respectively , and by splitting the @xmath8-integration we reveal the following two operators : @xmath89 where @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "we thus see that the weyl - heisenberg operators act as ordinary pauli operators ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) on each of the qubit subspaces defined by @xmath94 .",
    "the analog of the third pauli operator @xmath95 can be obtained from the product of the former two @xmath96 , yielding : @xmath97 with @xmath98 on the other hand , using the commutation rules for the phase space displacement operator , we find that @xmath99 , yielding @xmath100 .",
    "thus , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) , the three displacements implementing the logical pauli operations ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmay ] ) , form a triangular in phase space that encloses an area of @xmath101 . the latter is closely related to the fact that the anti - commutators between the displacements ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmay ] ) , vanish @xcite , yielding the anti - commutation relations of our logical pauli operators : @xmath102 as expected form the algebra of pauli matrices .    however , despite the similarities , the logical operations defined above are not completely equivalent to a pauli algebra in the general case .",
    "this becomes apparent from their commutation relations which are found to be @xmath103=2i\\hat z^\\dagger$ ] , @xmath104=2i\\hat y^\\dagger$ ] and @xmath105=2i\\hat x^\\dagger$ ] .",
    "they resemble those of the pauli matrices , but since the operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not hermitian , they deviate in the fact that the commutator between each of them yields the adjoint of the third one .",
    "we further note that , in the subspace spanned by the gpk states @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath108 are hermitian ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) .",
    "hence , in this subspace , the above commutation relations become equal to those of a real pauli algebra .",
    "the fact that we are dealing with a nonperfect pauli algebra has some consequences .",
    "for instance , if we calculate the square of one of the logical pauli operators we get : @xmath112 with @xmath113 , which differs from an identity through the appearance of an @xmath8 dependent phase factor under the integral .",
    "similarly , such phase factors also appear when manipulating the states @xmath114 and @xmath115 with one of the logical operations ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) or ( [ eq : sigmay ] ) .",
    "we will see later on that these phase factors become irrelevant if one considers only protocols involving a specific class of modular variables as readout observables . in light of the definition of these readout observables , which will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : readoutmodvar ] , we will also introduce appropriate rotation operators allowing to perform measurements according to different mutually unbiased bases of the logical space ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : modularrotations ] ) .",
    "consequently , the logical states and pauli operations , together with the modular readout observables and the corresponding rotations ( see secs .",
    "[ sec : readoutmodvar ] and [ sec : modularrotations ] ) , establish a solid framework to handle cv quantum information from a quantum measurement point of view .",
    "a qubit phase gate @xmath116 can be realized using the shear operation @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "it transforms the logical pauli operators , ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) , as : @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in this case , the shear implements a rotation of @xmath11 around the @xmath121-axis of the bloch sphere .",
    "further on , the hadamard gate @xmath122 can be directly realised using a rescaled fourier transform @xmath123 , with @xmath124 chosen as above , which transforms the logical pauli operators as @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in combination with the above defined logical phase - gate , we can define the fourier transformed shear @xmath127 which then implements a @xmath101-rotation of @xmath13 around the @xmath25-axis , namely @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the two - qubit clifford generator @xmath130 can be realized by the two - mode gaussian unitary @xmath131 which implements the operations @xmath132 and @xmath133 , with @xmath134 .",
    "note , that the logical controlled - phase gate @xmath135 follows from @xmath130 by an additional application of @xmath136 on the second mode .",
    "note that these logical operations implement the desired clifford group operation only when acting on perfect gkp logical states @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the finite squeezing of the logical states @xmath114 and @xmath72 leads to a faulty implementation of the above defined logical clifford operations which manifests itself by a washing out of the signal @xcite .",
    "in order to circumvent such errors one can apply gkp error correction to the encoded states @xcite , which keeps the squeezing on a tolerable level .",
    "this problem does not occur if we manipulate our logical qubits with the rotation operator defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : modularrotations ] .",
    "an experimental implementation of these rotations using the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons will be discussed later on in sec .",
    "[ sec : expproposal ] .",
    "we will move on now and show how measurements of suitably defined modular variables allow to retrieve binary quantum information that is encoded in terms of our modular logical states .",
    "we start by defining the observables @xmath137 , which are the analogous to the pauli matrices from the point of view of a measurement : @xmath138 with @xmath139 , @xmath140 a real and bounded function and @xmath141 defined as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigz ] ) , ( [ eq : sigx ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmaxpy ] ) .",

    "moreover , restricted to our logical space , defined by @xmath114 and @xmath72 , these expectation values can be expressed as @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "hence , we find that the expectation values of the observables ( [ eq : gammas ] ) are proportional to the bloch vector of the encoded qubit states , whereas the proportionality factors are determined by the overlap of @xmath147 with @xmath140",
    ". we can also define spatial and temporal correlators among observables of the kind of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammas ] ) , which have already been proven to be useful in the context of testing quantum mechanical properties in cv in @xcite .",
    "all these works involve measurements of particularly chosen modular variables that can be expressed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammas ] ) .",
    "the form of the operators ( [ eq : gammas ] ) is chosen so as to be operationally analogous to the logical pauli operations , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmay ] ) .",
    "interestingly , unwanted phase factors , appearing when manipulating the states @xmath114 and @xmath115 with some logical operation , disappear .",
    "for instance , if we consider the operator @xmath148 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : logicalzsquared ] ) ) and apply it to an arbitrary state of the logical space @xmath149 , we obtain @xmath150 , where @xmath151 differs from @xmath38 by a modular position ( momentum ) dependent phase factor , but we have @xmath152 , for all @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , for implementations of protocols involving measurements of the expectation values @xmath153 , the @xmath148 operator acts as the identity .",
    "similarly , phase factors that appear due to the application of the logical pauli operations ( [ eq : sigmaz ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmax ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmay ] ) to a logical state @xmath38 , are invisible to measurements of the expectation values of ( [ eq : gammas ] ) .",
    "consequently , this allows one to establish a solid framework for handling discrete quantum information encoded in the cv logical states @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    in appendix",
    "[ app : conditions ] , we discuss the conditions a general phase space observable @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a real - valued function , has to fulfill such that it can be written in the form ( [ eq : gammas ] ) . in general , we find that the observables ( [ eq : gammas ] ) are given by periodic phase space observables , meaning observables that can be expressed as : @xmath156 where @xmath157 are complex fourier coefficients obeying the normalization condition @xmath158 , and @xmath14 and @xmath159 denote to the periodicities in position and momentum of the corresponding phase space representation of @xmath154 . all three observables ( [ eq : gammas ] ) can be expressed as ( [ eq : doublefourier ] ) with different choices of @xmath157 , @xmath14 and @xmath159 ( see appendix  [ app : conditions ] ) .",
    "examples of such observables are , for instance , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "we note that the general definition of the observables ( [ eq : gammas ] ) leads only in the case @xmath166 , for all @xmath142 , to a real set of pauli operators .",
    "however , if one wants to favour the experimental accessibility of such observables via positive operator valued measurements ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : measurementpovm ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is desirable to keep the freedom of choice of the functions @xmath140 .",
    "this leads , in the general case where @xmath140 is given by a continuous function , to an operator with a continuous spectrum .",
    "once we have created the possibility of retrieving quantum information through measurement of binary observables defined in cv , one can complete the set of qubit like operations by defining arbitrary rotations on the encoded subspaces .",
    "however , since the operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unitary but not hermitian , arbitrary rotations can not be generated by simply exponentiating them with the proper multiplicative factors , as is true for the pauli matrices @xcite .",
    "this can be done only if we consider the operators ( [ eq : gammas ] ) in the special case , @xmath166 , for all @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath142 ( in the following denoted by @xmath167 ) , which then can be used to define @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 indicates the axis of rotation . equation ( [ eq : rotations ] ) allows to perform rotations of the general observables ( [ eq : gammas ] ) without changing the function @xmath140 and thus to implement measurements in different mutually unbiased bases of the corresponding logical space .",
    "note that , in contrary to logical operations introduced in @xcite , the operators ( [ eq : rotations ] ) perform well not only on the subspace spanned by perfect gkp states but also on the space spanned by the more general logical states @xmath114 and @xmath72 .",
    "a proposal of an experimental implementation of these rotation operations using the spatial distribution of single photons is discussed in sec .",
    "[ app : implementationlogops ] .",
    "in the following , we assume that the coordinates @xmath171 and @xmath172 refer to the transverse position and momentum of a single photon . these variables are related to the object or source plane ( position plane ) and the fourier plane ( momentum plane ) of a single - photon field . if we remain in the paraxial approximation , @xmath173 ( see fig .",

    "hence , by by adjusting the slit widths and distances of the grating , we can produce the logical qubit states @xmath178 and @xmath179 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , the photons are sent through a lens system before the grating in order to prepare them in approximate plane waves .",
    "this allows us additionally to adjust the width @xmath71 of the gaussian envelope of the wave function ( [ app : eq : approxgkp ] ) , which corresponds to the quality of the prepared plane waves .",
    "experimentally gratings are often realized using spatial light modulators ( slms ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) ) .",
    "note that the free propagation of the diffracted photons will lead to a blurring in the photon s transverse wave function .",
    "this effect is mainly due to the finite envelope of the photons transverse wave function and can be minimized by improving the quality of the prepared plane waves before the grating .",
    "the dependency of the blurring on the number of irradiated slits was studied in @xcite by calculating the fidelity of the initially prepared wave function with its revivals after multiples of a specific propagation distance , referred to as talbot distance .",
    "it was shown that , for currently available diffraction gratings , a fidelity higher than @xmath180 can be maintained for a propagation distance of about 10 times the talbot distance . for larger propagation distances one could possibly improve the fidelity using the earlier mentioned gkp error correction procedure to the transverse field of the photons .",
    "once it is known how to prepare single photons in the corresponding logical states @xmath114 and @xmath72 , we can try to entangle a pair of photons and further use it for the realization of quantum information protocols .",
    "one possibility to do so is by producing polarization entangled states in a type-2 parametric down - conversion process and subsequently swapping the polarization entanglement to the spatial distributions of the two photons , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the photons are sent through a mach - zehnder interferometer made up of polarization dependent beam - splitters , half- and quater - wave plates and diffraction gratings .",
    "the output states of the interferometers will yield to 50% the desired spatially entangled photons , while the other half of the emerging photons has to be discarded .",
    "details of the procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "all our following discussion about experimental implementations of single qubit rotations or measurements of readout observables rely on an optical element , called spatial light modulator ( slm ) .",
    "a slm consists usually of some transparent or reflective screen that is divided into a certain number of pixels whose diffraction index can be adjusted individually . in this way , one can impose spatial phase or amplitude modulations on a light beam that is transmitted or reflected by the slm . in particular , it is possible to implement operations of the form @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is an arbitrary user - defined function .",
    "similarly , one can implement phase modulations in momentum space by combining a slm with the fourier transform @xmath123 , which itself is realized optically with lenses , where @xmath124 is related to the focal length @xmath183 of the lens and the wave length @xmath184 through the relation @xmath185 ( see also fig .",
