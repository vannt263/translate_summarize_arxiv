    "over the past few years , the prospect of realizing majorana bound states ( mbss ) in superconducting hybrid devices has attracted a lot of attention , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "mbss are predicted to emerge , for instance , as end states in proximitized one - dimensional rashba nanowires in a magnetic zeeman field , where signatures for their existence have already been reported in transport experiments @xcite . for these topologically superconducting ( ts ) nanowires , mbss",
    "are located at the respective ends of the wire , and the overlap between their wavefunctions becomes exponentially small for large nanowire length @xmath0 .",
    "mbss can then intuitively be thought of as spatially separated `` half fermions '' .",
    "they are under discussion as basic ingredients for `` topological '' qubits in quantum information applications , where information is nonlocally stored and , thus , should be quite robust against local decoherence processes .",
    "systems with mbss are also predicted to allow for non - abelian ising anyon braiding statistics . since ising anyons",
    "do not allow for universal quantum computation by themselves , it is essential to thoroughly understand the physics of majorana states coupled to conventional qubits , where the latter can be realized in terms of nanoscale quantum dots @xcite .",
    "majorana bound states are described by self - adjoint operators , @xmath1 , which anticommute with each other , @xmath2 , and with all other fermion operators .",
    "a pair of mbss effectively forms a single nonlocal fermion with annihilation operator @xmath3 where the eigenvalue @xmath4 of the number operator @xmath5 describes the state of the mbs pair @xcite . for large @xmath0",
    ", the hybridization energy between the mbss forming this pair becomes exponentially small , @xmath6 the length @xmath7 refers to the spatial size of a mbs and is related to the superconducting coherence length in the proximitized nanowire @xcite . for @xmath8 , the mbs pair is then equivalent to a single zero - energy fermion .    in this work , we consider the simplest case of a single mbs pair and study the concurrence of entanglement , @xmath9 , between two single - level quantum dots @xcite tunnel - coupled to the mbss , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a schematic illustration of the setup .",
    "entanglement is a key concept in quantum mechanics and represents an essential resource for many quantum computation schemes @xcite .",
    "two spatially separated systems are said to be entangled when their quantum states can not be described independently .",
    "one may naively expect that because each mbs amounts to half of the same fermion state , the mbss themselves are strongly entangled .",
    "however , this is a meaningless statement since only the mbs pair has a well - defined state representation , see eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlocality of the @xmath10 fermion level suggests that the two dots coupled to the mbss could be fully entangled .",
    "for a grounded superconducting island , where the charging energy @xmath11 is negligible , this question has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and one finds that precisely the opposite statement holds true in the long - distance limit @xmath12 , i.e. , both dots are perfectly disentangled .",
    "this result is consistent with the absence of correlations among currents flowing through normal - conducting leads in contact to different mbss @xcite .",

    "large circles correspond to two quantum dots ( qd@xmath13 and qd@xmath14 ) , where gate voltages @xmath15 allow one to vary the energy levels @xmath16 .",
    "a rashba nanowire is deposited on a superconducting island with charging energy @xmath11 , where the proximity effect in combination with a zeeman field induces a ts phase .",
    "the dimensionless gate parameter @xmath17 ( see main text ) is proportional to a gate voltage @xmath18 regulating the average charge on the ts island .",
    "small ( red ) circles represent mbs operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the corresponding wavefunctions are located near the ends of the nanowire and the hybridization @xmath21 corresponds to the distance @xmath0 between both mbss , see eq .  .",
    "tunnel couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 connect the dots to the respective mbss .",
    "in addition , the josephson energy @xmath24 describes the coupling to another grounded bulk superconductor ( sc ) .",
    ", width=283 ]    in what follows , we are especially interested in the possibility of long - range entanglement generation , such that the concurrence @xmath25 does not decay up to very long dot distance @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we shall determine the detailed conditions for the realization of such a `` majorana entanglement bridge '' in the setup shown in fig .",
    "in particular , we find that the charging energy @xmath11 plays an important role in allowing for long - range entanglement generation , i.e. , one should work with a mesoscopic floating ( not grounded ) superconducting island .",
    "we note in passing that standard notions of long - range entanglement refer to an exponential decay , @xmath26 , and merely require that the lengthscale @xmath27 is long @xcite . in particular",
    ", for the topologically trivial limit of our setup , i.e. , when the superconducting island does not host mbss , such an exponential decay of @xmath25 is expected , see also ref .",

    "the length - independence of @xmath25 predicted for the device in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] holds as long as the charging energy , which scales approximately as @xmath28 in the ts nanowire geometry , remains the dominant energy scale .",
    "in particular , @xmath11 should exceed both the thermal energy @xmath29 and the mbs hybridization scale @xmath21 in eq .  .",

    "[ fig1 ] but with normal - conducting leads replacing the dots . for large @xmath11 and",
    "when the gate voltage is tuned to a coulomb blockade conductance peak , i.e. , the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 regulating the average island charge is half - integer , only two degenerate island charge states are accessible and the model effectively maps to a spinless resonant tunneling problem . in a slight abuse of terminology , the resulting nonlocal phase - coherent transfer of electrons from one lead to the other",
    "has been dubbed `` teleportation '' ( tp ) by fu @xcite , see also refs .",
    "however , it has been argued that entanglement may be achieved more efficiently under coulomb blockade valley conditions , i.e. , when @xmath17 stays close to an integer @xcite .",
    "as we discuss in detail below , entanglement is then a consequence of elastic cotunneling @xcite processes . in our setup ,",
    "elastic cotunneling has a strongly nonlocal character due to the underlying mbs realization of the @xmath10 fermion , and therefore this process has also been referred to as `` teleportation '' @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] below .",
    "when more than two mbss are present on the superconducting island , a nonperturbative version of the tp mechanism triggers the so - called topological kondo effect @xcite .",
    "however , in the present work we shall focus on just one mbs pair , where topological kondo physics is absent .",
    "besides tp processes , however , it is well - known that entanglement can also be generated through crossed andreev reflection ( car ) processes .",
    "so far , car - induced entanglement in a system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has only been discussed for the grounded device , where @xmath30 . as mentioned above ,",
    "when also @xmath31 , the dots will be perfectly disentangled , but for finite @xmath21 ( and hence not too large @xmath0 ) , car processes generate entanglement both for the case of normal - conducting leads @xcite and for the dot case at hand @xcite .",
    "this entanglement can be probed through the violation of bell inequalities when several mbs pairs are present @xcite . in general terms",
    ", car refers to the splitting of a cooper pair on the island which produces entangled electrons on different dots ( or leads ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the reverse process , a cooper pair is created by the combined in - tunneling of electrons from different sides . for normal - conducting leads",
    ", local andreev reflection competes with car , since both electrons can be created ( or annihilated ) also in the same lead , and hence perfect entanglement is not possible @xcite . for the single - level dots studied here ,",
    "however , local andreev reflection is absent and perfect entanglement due to car processes may be realized .",
    "below we address the fate of car - generated entanglement as well as the interplay of car and tp processes when interactions ( @xmath32 ) are important .",
    "in addition , we have also studied the time - dependent concurrence , @xmath33 , found after one tunnel coupling is suddently switched on .",
    "such a `` quench '' can be experimentally implemented by changing the voltage on a finger gate in close proximity to the respective tunnel contact , cf .",
    "@xcite . by monitoring the time - dependent concurrence",
    ", one can achieve a better understanding of the timescales on which entanglement is built up in such a setting @xcite . for the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with @xmath30 , this problem has recently been studied in ref .",

    "@xcite for the noninteracting case .",
    "more importantly , we also address the entanglement dynamics for finite charging energy , and reveal the underlying timescales governing this interacting case .    before going into a detailed discussion ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the main results of our work : ( i ) we consider the full crossover behavior of the concurrence all the way from vanishing to large charging energy , ( ii ) allow for arbitrary @xmath17 , ( iii ) carefully address issues related to fermion parity , ( iv ) include the effects of a josephson coupling @xmath24 to an additional bulk @xmath34-wave superconductor , ( v ) address the @xmath0-dependence of the concurrence by including the direct overlap @xmath21 between the mbss , and ( vi ) study the timescales of entanglement generation after the sudden change of a tunnel coupling .",
    "throughout the paper , we provide closed analytical expressions for the concurrence valid in different parameter regimes , both for the static and the time - dependent case , which are shown to give highly accurate approximations for our numerically exact results .",
    "importantly , our results can be quantitatively interpreted in terms of an interplay of tp and car processes , thereby providing a comprehensive physical framework to describe entanglement in mbs devices .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we provide a rather complete analysis of this problem , including both tp and car processes , and providing detailed analytical results for the concurrence .",

    "[ fig1 ] . for the detailed derivation of the model ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "we then turn to a discussion of the entanglement - generating tunneling mechanisms in sec .",
    "the concurrence , @xmath9 , provides a quantitative measure for entanglement of the two dots .",
    "we compute @xmath9 analytically in several parameter regimes of interest , and validate the results by comparing to exact numerical diagonalization in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . the time - dependent concurrence obtained after a quench of tunnel couplings",
    "will then be studied in sec .",
    "finally , we offer some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we focus on the most interesting zero - temperature limit and use units with @xmath35 .",
    "we start by briefly summarizing the low - energy hamiltonian , @xmath36 , describing the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , see also refs .",
    "@xmath37 contains ( i ) the part @xmath38 for the central ts island , where a mesoscopic superconductor with charging energy @xmath11 causes proximity - induced pairing in the nanowire , ( ii ) the josephson term @xmath39 coupling the ts island to a second bulk superconductor , ( iii ) the dot hamiltonian @xmath40 , and ( iv ) a tunneling hamiltonian @xmath41 connecting the dots and the island .",
    "we consider energy scales well below the proximity - induced superconducting gap , such that it is justified to neglect quasiparticle excitations of the ts ( see also the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] ) .",
    "the state of the island is then fully described by specifying the integer cooper pair number @xmath42 on the central island , where the number operator @xmath43 is canonically conjugate to the superconductor s phase , @xmath44_-=-i$ ] , and the occupation number @xmath45 for the @xmath10 fermion built from the mbs pair , see eq .  .",
    "including the mbs hybridization ( [ epsfl ] ) and a coulomb charging term , with the single - electron charging energy @xmath11 and a dimensionless gate - voltage parameter @xmath17 , the island hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the nonlocal @xmath10 fermion representing the mbs pair thus couples to the condensate dynamics through coulomb charging effects .",
    "furthermore , the josephson coupling @xmath24 to another bulk superconductor ( which is held at constant phase @xmath48 and different from the superconductor responsible for the proximity - induced pairing in the nanowire ) is described by @xmath49 where the operator @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) raises ( lowers ) the cooper pair number by one unit , @xmath52 .",
    "next , each quantum dot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is assumed to be in the coulomb blockade regime such that the two dots can be modeled as single fermion levels at energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 , see ref .",
    "these levels can be tuned by electrostatic gates ( @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and by the zeeman field which induces the ts phase of the wire and also breaks spin degeneracy on the dots . as a consequence",
    ", we can use the effectively spinless fermion annihilation operator , @xmath56 , which is connected by a tunnel coupling @xmath57 to @xmath58 , see eq .",
    "this tunnel coupling also captures a possible spin dependence of microscopic transition amplitudes and can be taken as real - valued positive , see ref .",
    "the hamiltonian describing both dots then reads @xmath59 where the number operator @xmath60 has eigenvalues @xmath61 .",
    "equation represents a pair of charge qubits that can be entangled through the majorana island . while charge qubits are more susceptible to detrimental noise than spin qubits @xcite , it is more transparent to analyze the concurrence within the present formulation .",
    "the extension of the above model to the case of spin qubits , where local qubit operations are also easier to implement , is rather straightforward by following the route sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , this case is considerably more involved on a technical level , since one then effectively needs two ts nanowires .",
    "we here discuss the simpler spinless case , but due to the spatial separation of the dots , the results reported below represent `` useful entanglement '' @xcite that could be exploited in quantum computation schemes .    finally , we come to the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath41 . note that within our low - energy model , no ts quasiparticles are available for single - electron tunneling processes , and tunneling therefore has to involve mbss .",
    "we consider sufficiently large @xmath0 such that @xmath62 is tunnel - coupled only to the mbs described by @xmath63 , see eq .   and fig .",
    "similarly , the mbs coupled to @xmath64 corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "it is now crucial to take into account charge conservation , since a floating mesoscopic superconductor can not simply absorb or emit charge @xmath66 without energy cost  this is possible only in the grounded case where @xmath30 .",
    "this consideration implies that tunneling terms @xmath67 must include a factor @xmath51 , which annihilates a cooper pair and thus restores charge balance . with the gauge choice in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath68 + { \\rm h.c .",
    "} , \\ ] ] where `` normal '' tunneling terms like @xmath69 do not affect the condensate but `` anomalous '' tunneling terms such as @xmath70 change the cooper pair number by one unit .    in what follows , it will be convenient to choose occupation number basis states , @xmath71 to represent the hamiltonian .",
    "for this basis choice , the quantum numbers take the values @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 restricts the number of cooper pairs . here",
    "@xmath74 is taken relative to @xmath75 , and the @xmath76 limit of interest is rapidly approached when @xmath11 is finite . the basis size is then @xmath77 , and @xmath37 becomes a @xmath78 matrix .",
    "diagonalization of this matrix yields the ground state @xmath79 , which in turn determines the amount of entanglement between the two dots as explained below .      in order to quantify entanglement",
    ", one has to identify a suitable measure . for our bipartite case with two single - level quantum dots , a convenient and reliable measure is given by the concurrence , even though its construction is rather formal and abstract @xcite .",
    "the concurrence is expressed in terms of the reduced density matrix @xmath80 for the dots , which follows from the full density matrix after tracing over the island degrees of freedom . in the zero temperature limit , this yields the hermitian @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 with trace equal to unity .",
    "the concurrence is then defined by @xcite @xmath83 with the eigenvalues @xmath84 of the matrix @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath87 and the @xmath88 pauli matrices act in the respective @xmath89 ( with @xmath61 ) space corresponding to each of the two dots .",
    "equation implies @xmath90 , with @xmath91 for separable ( non - entangled ) states and @xmath92 for maximally entangled states .",
    "we note that the concurrence defined in eq .",
    "is a gauge - invariant quantity , i.e. , we can use the above gauge choice with real - valued @xmath57 in eq .  .",
    "we have also computed the negativity @xcite , which is an alternative measure for entanglement . while detailed results for the negativity differ from those for the concurrence , the physical conclusions are the same . from now on ,",
    "we therefore discuss the concurrence only .",
    "numerically , @xmath9 follows from eq .",
    "once the full ground state of the total system , @xmath79 , has been determined by diagonalization of the @xmath78 hamiltonian matrix .",
    "analytical progress is possible when @xmath79 has a simple form .",
    "an important example is given by @xmath93 with arbitrary cooper pair numbers @xmath94 and complex coefficients @xmath95 subject to normalization , @xmath96 . calculating @xmath9 in eq .   for this state",
    ", we find that at least one pair of number states in eq .",
    "must have identical @xmath97 in order to produce entanglement .",
    "there are two such possibilities , ( i ) @xmath98 with @xmath99 , or ( ii ) @xmath100 with @xmath101 . in both cases , the concurrence is given by @xmath102 see also ref .",
    "@xcite . suppressing the @xmath97 indices , maximally entangled states with @xmath92 thus correspond to the bell states @xmath103 .",
    "let us now address symmetries and conserved quantities for our model .",
    "we first note that the total fermion parity defined as @xmath104 is a conserved quantity since @xmath37 contains no terms mixing states with even and odd total electron number .",
    "the even - parity ( odd - parity ) sector has @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , where the parity - resolved ground states , @xmath107 , follow by diagonalization of a hamiltonian matrix of size @xmath108 only .",
    "conservation of @xmath109 will generally be weakly broken in concrete physical realizations due to quasiparticles neglected in our model . in the presence of parity relaxation",
    ", the true ground state then corresponds to the @xmath107 state with lower energy .",
    "however , we here assume that @xmath109 is conserved on all timescales of interest , such that both states @xmath107 are experimentally relevant and the concurrence depends on total fermion parity , @xmath110 .",
    "although this assumption represents an experimental challenge due to the inevitable presence of residual quasiparticle poisoning , very recent experiments indicate that the corresponding timescales may reach minutes in similar devices as considered here @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath17-dependence of the parity - constrained concurrence , @xmath111 .",
    "since a shift @xmath112 can be absorbed by shifting @xmath113 in the hamiltonian , see eq .",
    ", all observables have to be periodic in @xmath17 with period @xmath114 .",
    "( in the presence of parity relaxation , the period will in general be reduced to @xmath115 . )",
    "we thus obtain a first symmetry relation for the concurrence , @xmath116 this relation allows us to restrict @xmath17 to the window @xmath117 throughout .",
    "a second relation follows from an electron - hole - like symmetry property of @xmath37 which relates the odd- and even - parity concurrences , @xmath118 in order to derive eq .  , we first note that @xmath37 is invariant under the replacement @xmath119 with @xmath120 , accompanied by a `` particle - hole transformation '' @xmath121 that exchanges creation and annihilation operators , @xmath122 etc . , and @xmath123 yielding @xmath124 .",
    "this symmetry implies that if we have the ground state @xmath125 , we obtain another ground state from the relation @xmath126 now the point is that these two ground states have different total parities .",
    "indeed , the original state has @xmath127 , while the transformed one has @xmath128 .",
    "we thus arrive at eq .  .",
    "in passing we note that for an island hosting more than one pair of mbss , if an odd number of dots is tunnel - coupled to mbss , we instead would have @xmath129 , and eq .",
    "does not connect different parity sectors anymore .",
    "moreover , the above arguments also show that the relative sign between @xmath42 and @xmath45 in eq .",
    "is irrelevant .    for our island with a single mbs pair , eq .",
    "states that the concurrence in the odd - parity sector directly follows from the even - parity result by simply inverting the energy scales @xmath130 and letting @xmath131 . from now on , unless noted otherwise , we therefore describe results for the even - parity sector @xmath105 only , where it is sufficient to consider gate - voltage parameters in the window @xmath117 .",
    "before turning to detailed results for the concurrence of the two dots in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , let us first discuss the entanglement - generating processes at work in such a system , where the nonlocality of the @xmath10 fermion built from the mbs pair turns out to be crucial . when searching for maximally entangled states of the two dots , eq",
    ".   suggests two candidate sets for suitable superpositions of dot states @xmath132 , @xmath133 in this section , we shall focus on the large-@xmath11 case , assuming that @xmath17 is not half - integer such that the equilibrium island state is uniquely defined .",
    "hence the cooper pair number corresponds to @xmath134 , and for @xmath105 , we have @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) for set a ( b ) .    to realize the maximally entangled bell states , ( virtual ) tunneling processes through the island now have to provide the necessary coupling between states within a given set .",
    "the resulting superpositions should ideally have equal weight , which is possible when the dot energy levels are adjusted to fulfill the condition @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) for states in set a ( b ) .",
    "perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes then shows the existence of two different entanglement - generating mechanisms , namely elastic cotunneling ( i.e. , tp ) and car .",
    "in fact , our quantitative results will find a natural interpretation in terms of these two mechanisms .",
    "the tp mechanism refers to the nonlocal transfer of an electron across the ts island .",
    "for example , let us consider the state @xmath139 , where an electron resides in the left dot and the right dot is empty .",
    "we now study how a coupling to the partner state @xmath140 in set a is established by @xmath41 . after the in - tunneling process from the left dot ,",
    "the island charge will change by one unit .",
    "however , this change typically comes with an energy cost of order @xmath11 and , therefore , is possible only as a virtual process .",
    "the corresponding out - tunneling event restores the equilibrium charge state again and thereby may transfer an electron to the right dot . in effect , this process is similar to elastic cotunneling @xcite but with two major differences .",
    "first , tp has a highly nonlocal character inherited from the nonlocality of the @xmath10 fermion .",
    "second , because of the existence of `` normal '' and `` anomalous '' tunneling terms in @xmath41 , there are two different contributions . using the notation in eq .",
    "( [ statelabel ] ) , the first one ( denoted by tp@xmath141 ) proceeds solely by `` normal '' tunneling ( @xmath142 ) , while the second contribution ( tp@xmath143 ) only employs `` anomalous '' tunneling processes , @xmath144 by virtue of the processes in eq .  , the @xmath139 and @xmath140 states are coupled together . for @xmath137 , both states enter the superposition with equal weight .",
    "they may then form the maximally entangled bell state @xmath145 in eq .  , where tp is responsible for long - range entanglement .",
    "finally , we note that the tp phenomenon discussed by fu @xcite is a resonant version of the above process , which takes place near half - integer values of @xmath17 .",
    "we will address this case in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] , where we show that perfect entanglement is not possible under coulomb blockade peak conditions .",
    "car provides a distinct second entanglement - generating mechanism , where for @xmath138 , the two dot states in set b enter the superposition with equal weight and may yield the bell state @xmath146 in eq .  .",
    "since entangled states have to involve a pair of number states with matching @xmath97 entries , see eq .  , the two states of interest now correspond to @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "their total particle numbers are different , and hence not only the tunnel couplings @xmath149 , but also a finite josephson coupling @xmath24 to another bulk superconductor is needed in order to yield non - zero concurrence .",
    "we now show that this condition arises even though car processes can connect states with different island particle number @xmath150 already for @xmath151 . indeed ,",
    "starting from @xmath147 , there are six different car transitions corresponding to all permutations of the three elementary transfer processes @xmath152 . as an example",
    ", we show two of these car sequences , @xmath153 where the first ( second ) step for the car@xmath13 ( car@xmath14 ) process describes anomalous tunneling , the respective third step corresponds to normal tunneling , and the second ( first ) step involves the josephson coupling in eq .  . in the latter step ,",
    "a cooper pair is transferred to the ts island .",
    "it is only because of this step that the two states @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be connected .",

    "we thus have complemented our picture of the system in fig .",

    "such an analysis of the entanglement dynamics becomes more difficult for other parameters within the large-@xmath11 regime , we here briefly consider the case @xmath318 with @xmath365 , where car processes can establish entanglement .",
    "the josephson coupling now makes the inclusion of higher - energy states with different total particle numbers necessary , and exact expressions for the envelope curves as in eqs .   and are more challenging to obtain .",
    "nonetheless , analytical estimates are still possible in the perturbative regime , where we obtain @xmath351 as in eq .   but with @xmath366 , using @xmath324 in eq .  .",
    "the car - induced entanglement dynamics at @xmath165 is thus characterized by a sinusoidal envelope function again but has the rather long timescale @xmath367 .",

    "in this paper , we have provided a detailed study of entanglement in a floating topological superconducting island hosting a pair of mbss , each of which is tunnel - coupled to a single - level dot .",
    "the concurrence then provides a convenient measure to quantify entanglement of the two dots .",
    "we have shown that this setup offers a robust route towards the implementation of a `` majorana entanglement bridge '' where the concurrence does not exhibit any decay with increasing separation of the mbss . the only restriction for the separation of the quantum dots",
    "then is given by requiring a finite charging energy on the island , yielding much longer ranges of entanglement than in usual notions of exponential decay .",
    "this unique behavior is due to the intrinsic nonlocality of the fermion state representing the pair of mbss .",
    "the underlying mechanisms for entanglement generation have been identified in an intuitive yet quantitative manner . in particular , we have shown that entanglement is created by the interplay of teleportation and crossed andreev reflection processes . with this understanding , we were then able to discuss the more complicated entanglement dynamics after the quench of a tunnel coupling in terms of simple envelope functions .",
    "we have studied entanglement for the majorana device in fig .",

    "although the concurrence has a rather formal definition , the predicted entanglement features should be observable in mesoscopic transport experiments , where the two dots are weakly coupled to additional leads as described , e.g. , in ref .  @xcite . since current - current correlation functions",
    "can detect the violation of bell inequalities @xcite , signatures of entanglement are expected to appear in shot noise measurements , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for related proposals . in principle",
    "also suitably designed conductance measurements could probe entanglement @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work @xcite indicates that devices corresponding to the model studied here are in close reach .",

    "@xcite , where quantum dots can be formed spontaneously near the ts wire ends when contacting them by au leads @xcite .",
    "in order to reach the regime @xmath377 assumed in our model , the charging energy could be lowered by simply increasing the wire length . on the other hand , it may be possible to achieve significant entanglement between the dots even when @xmath378 , where fermionic ts quasiparticles should be taken into account .",
    "when such states are localized in the bulk of the ts such that they do not have significant overlap with the majorana bound states , they have no effect on entanglement .",
    "when low - lying quasiparticle states are localized near the ts nanowire ends , the physics discussed here may change , but entanglement may nonetheless be possible according to our preliminary analysis , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . using nbtin @xcite or inas / al @xcite to proximity - induce superconductivity in a device similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , extremely small poisoning rates have been reported as well . in any case , a detailed study of quasiparticle effects on entanglement is beyond the scope of the present work .",
