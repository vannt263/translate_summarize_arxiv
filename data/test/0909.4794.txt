    "the top quark s large mass , by far the heaviest fundamental particle known , makes it a unique probe of physics at the natural electroweak scale .",
    "although the top quark mass is consistent with other precision electroweak measurements within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) , no fundamental explanation exists for the reasons why top quarks should be so massive .",
    "the large mass of the top quark arises from its large couplings to the symmetry breaking sector of the sm .",
    "precision measurements of the top mass , width and couplings may therefore lead to a deeper understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass .",
    "such measurements are possible in part because the top quark s natural width of @xmath11 is much greater than the hadronization timescale set by @xmath12 , causing the top quark to decay to a real @xmath13 boson and a bottom quark before hadronization .",
    "the top quark can therefore be completely described by perturbative qcd , and studied as a bare quark .",
    "the sm predicts that top quarks are created via two independent production mechanisms in hadron colliders .",
    "the primary mode , in which a  pair is produced from a @xmath14 vertex via the strong interaction , was used by the d0 and cdf collaborations to establish the existence of the top quark in 1995  @xcite , and measure its mass .",
    "the second production mode of top quarks at hadron colliders is the electroweak production of a single top quark from a @xmath15 vertex .",
    "the predicted cross section for single top production is about half that of  pairs , but the signal - to - background ratio is much worse ; measurement of the single top quark production cross section has therefore until recently been impeded by its low rate and difficult background environment compared to the top pair production .    extracting a single top signature would be an independent confirmation of the top quark existence and a means to measure the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath16 , and study the @xmath15 coupling .",
    "measuring the single top quark production cross section is also crucial in understanding the backgrounds to searches for the higgs boson and new physics beyond - the - sm . in this paper",
    "i describe the analysis that led to the observation of single top production  @xcite by the d0 collaboration , and the measurement of the corresponding production cross sections .",
    "in the sm , single top production at hadron colliders provides an opportunity to study the charged - current weak - interaction of the top quark .",
    "figure  [ fig : feynman ] shows representative feynman diagrams for single top quark production at hadron colliders for @xmath8-channel ( fig .",
    "1a ) , and @xmath7-channel production ( fig .",
    "a third process , usually called `` associate production '' , in which the top quark is produced together with a @xmath13 boson , has negligible cross section at the tevatron .",
    "-channel and ( b ) @xmath7-channel single top quark production.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the sm predicts that the top quark decays almost exclusively to a @xmath13 boson and a bottom quark with @xmath17 .",
    "the rate for the process leads to a firm prediction for the top quark decay width @xmath18 .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath18 is of great importance , because the width would be affected by any non - expected decay modes of the top quark , whether they are observed or not .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath18 can not be directly measured in the  sample at hadron colliders , but its main component can be accessed through single top processes . if there are only three generations , the unitarity constrain of the ckm matrix implies that @xmath19 is very close to unity .",
    "but , the presence of a heavy fourth generation quark with a large ckm coupling to the top quark could be consistent with large values of @xmath20 , while resulting in an almost entirely unconstrained value for @xmath19 .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath19 can therefore explore the possibility of a fourth generation , and confirm that the top quark discovered at the tevatron is indeed the su(2 ) partner of the bottom quark .    as can be seen from the feynman diagrams ,",
    "the single top production cross section is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "a measurement of the single top quark production cross section therefore provides the only known way to directly measure @xmath19 at a hadron collider .",
    "the d0 detector  @xcite is a multi - purpose apparatus designed to study  collisions at high energies .",
    "it consists of three major subsystems . at the core of the detector ,",
    "a magnetized tracking system precisely records the trajectories of charged particles and measures their transverse momenta .",
    "a hermetic , finely - grained uranium and liquid argon calorimeter measures the energies of electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "a muon spectrometer measures the momenta of muons .",
    "the result presented in this document is based on @xmath1 of data recorded using the d0 detector between 2002 and 2007 .",
    "the data were collected with a logical or of many trigger conditions that results in a fully efficient trigger selection for the single top signal .",
    "events are selected containing exactly one isolated high @xmath22 electron or muon , missing transverse energy , and at least two jets , with at least one jet being identified as originating from the fragmentation of a @xmath2 quark .",
    "the @xmath23 is required not to be aligned with the direction of the lepton or the leading jet to limit the number of events originating from qcd multijet production entering our candidate samples .",
    "the data are divided into 24 mutually exclusive subsamples to take advantage of the different signal : background ratios and dominant sources of background .",
    "the sample is divided based on the tevatron running period ( run iia or run iib ) , the lepton flavor ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , the jet multiplicity ( 2 , 3 jets or 4 jets ) , and the number of jets identified as originating from @xmath2 quarks ( 1 or 2 @xmath2-tags ) . in each case , the leading @xmath2-tagged jet is required to have @xmath26 .",
    "the efficiency of this selection is @xmath27 for @xmath8-channel and @xmath28 for @xmath7-channel single top production .",
    "single top signal events are modeled using the comphep - based next - to - leading order ( nlo ) monte carlo ( mc ) event generator singletop  @xcite .",
    "the singletop generator is chosen as it preserves the spin information for the decay products of the top quark and resulting @xmath13  boson .",
    "pythia  @xcite is used to model the hadronization of any generated partons .",
    "we assume sm production for the ratio of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 cross sections .",
    "the , @xmath13+jets , and @xmath31+jets backgrounds are simulated using the alpgen leading - log mc event generator  @xcite , with pythia used to model hadronization .",
    "the background is normalized to the predicted cross section for a top quark mass of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the @xmath32+jets background is obtained by scaling the alpgen cross sections by factors derived from calculations of nlo effects  @xcite . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are scaled by 1.47 , and @xmath35 by 1.38 .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are scaled by 1.52 and 1.67 .",
    "diboson backgrounds are modeled using pythia .",
    "all mc events are passed through a geant - based simulation  @xcite of the d0 detector .",
    "small additional corrections are applied to all reconstructed objects to improve the agreement between collider data and simulation .",
    "in particular , we correct mismodeling of the pseudorapidity of the jets , and the distance between the two leading jets in the @xmath13+jets sample .    the multijet background is modeled using collider data containing leptons that are not isolated . in the electron channel ,",
    "the transverse momentum of the lepton is reweighted to properly match the shape of the background events passing the candidate selection . to increase the statistics in the muon channel , the jet closest to the muon",
    "is removed and recalculated .",
    "cuts on the total transverse energy of the event ( @xmath38 ) ensure that the multijet background is a small ( less than 5% ) contribution to the candidate sample . the overall normalization of the multijet and the total @xmath13+jets background is obtained by comparing the background expectation to collider data in three sensitive variables : @xmath39 , , and the @xmath13  boson transverse mass .",
    "this normalization is done after subtracting from the data sample the contributions from the small backgrounds (  , @xmath31+jets , and dibosons ) separately for each running period ( run iia or run iib ) , leptonic channel ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , and jet multiplicity bin ( 2 , 3 , or 4 jets ) .",
    "the normalization is performed before @xmath2-tagging , when the expected signal to background ratio is on average s : b=1:260 .",
    "the probability of the @xmath2-tagging algorithm to identify a jet as originating from a @xmath2-quark is measured in data containing jets and muons , and is parametrized as a function of jet flavor , @xmath22 , and @xmath40 with so - called tag - rate - functions .",
    "we find that after @xmath2-tagging , an additional empirical correction needs to be applied to the normalization of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 samples .",
    "the correction factor of @xmath41 is derived from the two - jet data sample and applied to all jet multiplicity bins ; the overall @xmath13+jets normalization remains unchanged .",
    "after @xmath2-tagging the expected s : b=1:21 for the sample with 1 @xmath2-tag and 1:15 for the sample with 2 @xmath2-tags .",
    "using @xmath1 of data we selected 4,519 events , and expect @xmath42 single top quark events .",

    ".number of expected and observed events in 2.3  fb@xmath43 of d0 data . in the table , the event yields for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and 1 and 2 @xmath2-tagged jets have been combined . [",

    "figure  [ fig : xsecsum ] summarizes the cross sections measured by each of the mva techniques and compares them to theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section measured the combined single top cross production section assuming the ratio between the @xmath8- and @xmath7-channel production modes to be fixed , and given by the sm .",
    "however , this ratio could be modified by beyond - the - sm physics processes , for instance additional quark generations , new heavy bosons  @xcite , flavor - changing neutral currents  @xcite , or anomalous top quark couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to measure the two production modes individually , and compare them to theoretical predictions .    in this section",
    "i present a recent d0 analysis  @xcite that uses the same dataset , event selection , and signal / background modeling as the observation analysis presented in the previous section , but the mva filters are specifically trained to extract the single top quark events produced via the @xmath7-channel mode .",
    "this results in a measurement of the @xmath7-channel cross section that is independent of the @xmath8-channel cross section model .",
    "even though we use the same set of variables as in the observation analysis , only @xmath7-channel single top events are considered signal during the optimization .",
