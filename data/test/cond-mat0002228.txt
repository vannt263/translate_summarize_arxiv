    "the current understanding of the details of quantum hall effect relies crucially on the composite fermion picture @xcite .",
    "an important step in the development of this understanding was the introduction of statistical gauge fields and the rle they play in the landau - ginsparg effective action , @xcite .",
    "in fact the law of corresponding states of reference @xcite has an interpretation as a beautiful and extremely powerful generalisation of kramers - wannier duality , @xcite @xcite , though references @xcite and @xcite were completely independent of one another and appeared almost simultaneously .    kramers - wannier duality is a discrete @xmath0 map of the partition function for the 2-dimensional ising model at one temperature to the same partition function at a different temperature .",
    "its power lies in the prediction of the critical temperature without having to solve the model . since its discovery however other techniques have proven more useful",
    " not only because the model has since been solved exactly in 2-dimensions but also because , being a discrete symmetry , duality is all or nothing affair .",
    "there is no algorithm for finding such symmetries  it is hit and miss guesswork .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the renormalisation group approach has proven more powerful as a technique for understanding the physics at and near critical points associated with second order phase transitions  not only for the 2 and 3-dimensional ising models in the presence of an external magnetic field but also for many other models .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) approach can not really be called an algorithm ( it has many different manifestations all of which come under the same general heading of `` rg '' ) but it is nevertheless algorithmic in nature  given a field theoretical model one can perturb around free field theory and hope to apply some version of the rg to extract physical information without actually having to solve the model .",
    "nevertheless interest in duality has never died perhaps because of the elegance of the idea but also because , if one _ can _ find a duality , one can obtain exact results whereas the perturbative rg is always an approximation . with duality",
    "the chances of success are smaller but the payoff is greater .",
    "a @xmath0 duality for massive maxwell - chern - simons theory was discovered in @xcite which necessitated the introduction of a complex coupling with positive imaginary part .",
    "a generalisation of kramers - wannier duality from @xmath0 to an infinite discrete non - abelian group ( called the modular group , which is defined in the next section ) was discovered for a coupled clock model in @xcite .",
    "being a larger group this leads to a much more complicated phase diagram and it has been suggested that a version of this duality applies to potts models with a complex temperature , @xcite .",
    "the importance of the modular group , and some of its sub - groups , for the quantum hall effect was realised in @xcite and @xcite and this led to the development of the phase diagram compatible with modular symmetry first presented in @xcite .",
    "interest in duality has also seen a major revival recently in the context of super - symmetric gauge theories and string theory ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "very strong results can be obtained by combining duality symmetry ( when one can be derived ) with rg techniques .",
    "this was first done for the quantum hall effect in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the duality map should commute with the rg flow which puts very strong constraints on the @xmath1-functions of the theory .",
    "for example fixed ( i.e. self - dual ) points of duality symmetry correspond to fixed points of the rg and therefore the @xmath1-functions would be expected to vanish at these points  even if they correspond to strongly coupled theories in the field theoretic sense .",
    "since @xcite appeared a number of authors has examined the constraints put on the rg flow by modular symmetry under various other assumptions , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed one can use this approach , together with particle - hole symmetry , to derive the semi - circle law for transitions for quantum hall transitions very generally without any recourse to a specific microscopic model  it follows very generally from the duality symmetry , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore further the consequences of this infinite generalisation of kramers - wannier duality for the quantum hall effect . in particular electron spin",
    "is incorporated into the duality picture and it is argued that when the splitting of the landau levels due to electron spin is small compared to the cyclotron energy the relevant duality symmetry is smaller than when the landau levels are all well separated . technically speaking",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath2 in the former case and @xmath3 in the latter ( these groups are defined in the next section ) .    in order to compare this prediction with experiment some extra assumptions about the form of the @xmath1-functions",
    "are necessary and here the analysis of @xcite is applied to the case of small spin splitting .",
    "this involves a very specific assumption concerning the form of the @xmath1-functions  that they are meromorphic in the sense of a natural complex conductivity , @xmath4 ( throughout this paper units are used in which @xmath5 ) .",
    "unfortunately this assumption has no microscopic justification to date , rather it is made on the basis of analogy with other models with modular symmetry as a duality , @xcite .",
    "however it leads to such specific predictions that is easily falsifiable , though comparisons with experimental data show that its predictions agree very well with the currently available data lending some confidence that a justification may be found in the future .",
    "the available data to date , at strong fields and at low enough temperatures for the law of corresponding states to represent a symmetry , seem to be compatible with @xmath3 when the meromorphic ansatz is used , so it is not possible to test the specific predictions made here concerning the @xmath2 case .",
    "this must wait for future experiments .",
    "an important aspect of the comparison with experimental data made in section six is the normalisation of the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath6 .",
    "this is a problem for experiment , which in reality measures the longitudinal resistance @xmath7 , and it is usually assumed these are related by @xmath8 in a rectangular sample of length @xmath9 and width @xmath10 .",
    "the assumptions that go into this relation are examined in section five where it is argued that a better formula is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an undetermined sample dependent function with the universal property that @xmath13 .",
    "the duality symmetry of the quantum hall effect however suggests an alternative method for extracting @xmath6 from the experimental @xmath7 , at least for hall - hall transitions .",
    "given that the duality group , together with particle - hole symmetry , predicts the semi - circle law one can use this to determine the normalisation of @xmath7 by _ assuming _ the semi - circle law at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "this technique can not determine the normalisation by using a laughlin state - insulator transition because these correspond to vertical lines in the complex @xmath14-plane , which remain vertical under any re - scaling of @xmath6 .",
    "however this very fact dictates that laughlin state - insulator crossovers should be semi - circles in the @xmath15-plane for any normalisation of @xmath6 and this gives a quantitative method of determining when the temperature is ` low enough ' for the infinite duality symmetry to be valid  the laughlin state - insulator transitions must be semi - circles in the complex @xmath15-plane . when this is the case the normalisation of @xmath6 for a hall - hall transition can be extracted from the experimental data by choosing the normalisation so as to get as close as possible to a semi - circle for the crossover in the complex @xmath14-plane .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section two the definition of the modular group and its various relevant sub - groups is reviewed together with its action in the quantum hall effect ; section three discusses the relation between the modular group and scaling ; section four introduces the specific ansatz of meromorphic @xmath1-functions ; section five is devoted to the relation between the longitudinal resistance and resistivity while section six compares the predictions of section four to existing experimental data .",
    "finally section seven contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the law of corresponding states @xcite was originally proposed on the basis of an effective field theory  maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
    "it provides a powerful method for classifying quantum hall states and transitions between them , both integral and fractional , as well as for hall - insulator transitions .",
    "the law is expressed by writing the conductivities ( both longitudinal @xmath16 and transverse @xmath17 ) as functions of the filling factor @xmath18 .",
    "then the following transformations were defined in @xcite :    * landau level addition transformation ( * l * ) @xmath19 * flux attachment transformation ( * f * ) @xmath20 * particle - hole transformation ( * p * ) @xmath21    as discussed in @xcite under certain circumstances the arrows above can be replaced by equalities and then these transformations become _",
    "symmetries_. this is not expected to be true in general but should hold , for example , as the temperature @xmath22 tends to zero .    at almost exactly the same time , but from a completely different perspective , the modular group @xcite or some of its sub - groups @xcite were also implicated as being relevant to these phenomena . in this approach",
    "one defines a _ complex _ conductivity , @xmath23 , which by necessity lives on the upper - half complex plane since @xmath24 , and a group action @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are any four integers satisfying @xmath28 .",
    "this condition can re - written by defining a @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 and demanding that @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to check from the definition ( [ gammadef ] ) that , for any three such matrices satisfying @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 .",
    "thus the group multiplication law is given by matrix multiplication .",
    "note that for any given matrix @xmath34 the matrix @xmath35 gives the same transformation since the minus signs cancel above and below in ( [ gammadef ] ) .",
    "the resulting group is called the modular group in the mathematical literature , sometimes denoted @xmath36 , and it is related to @xmath37 .",
    "matrices of real numbers with unit determinant ( @xmath38 ) obtained by restricting to integral entries .",
    "] they are not quite the same group because @xmath37 distinguishes between @xmath34 and @xmath35 whereas @xmath36 does not , so @xmath36 is obtained from @xmath37 by identifying @xmath34 and @xmath35 as group elements , or in other words projecting out by a @xmath0 factor , so @xmath39 .",
    "any element of the modular group can be obtained by taking a string of products of the two generators @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in this matrix notation landau level addition and flux attachment",
    "are represented by @xmath42 and @xmath43 and these two transformations generate an infinite discrete group , which is a sub - group of @xmath36 , often denoted by @xmath44 in the mathematical literature ( see @xcite for example , another notation commonly used is @xmath45 , @xcite ) . any element @xmath46 can be represented by some string of products of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this sub - group is most succinctly described by restricting the integer @xmath49 in the matrix @xmath34 to be even .",
    "the particle - hole transformation @xmath50 is an outer auto - morphism of the modular group and also of the sub - group , @xmath3 .",
    "the hypothesis that these transformations represent a symmetry can now be expressed as @xmath51 ( flux attachment is easily transcribed from resistivities to conductivities , in complex notation , by @xmath52 , with @xmath53 ) .    other sub - groups of @xmath36 have been proposed in the literature as being relevant to the quantum hall effect , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and it shall be argued here that the group proposed in @xcite is relevant when spin splitting of the electrons results in the landau levels that are not very well separated . obviously the zeeman effect would result in landau levels that are split but it is also argued in @xcite the exchange energy between electrons of opposite spin in electron - electron interactions can be larger than the zeeman energy .",
    "thus , despite the difference in philosophy , the two approaches in @xcite and @xcite give the same results at zero temperature , where the law of corresponding states becomes a symmetry in @xcite which is precisely the symmetry group @xmath44 in @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is in many ways more powerful however since , once one realizes that the law of corresponding states is a group , one can bring the full machinery of group theory to bear on the problem  indeed there is a very highly developed and beautiful mathematical literature on the modular group and its sub - groups and the transformation properties of functions of @xmath15 under this group action , @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , one can deduce the selection rule @xmath54 for transitions between two states with filling factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 odd , @xcite .",
    "however the law of corresponding states does serve to highlight the physics of the problem  in particular the landau level addition symmetry assumes that the physics at any partially filled landau level is independent of how many lower landau levels are completely full .",
    "while this seems a reasonable assumption when the landau levels are well spaced it is not so reasonable if any two landau levels get close to one another .",
    "spin splitting is important here : if one ignores electron spin the landau levels of the unperturbed hamiltonian are all evenly spaced , but including spin and a land @xmath59-factor could result either in well spaced landau levels ( if the landau splitting is comparable to the cyclotron energy ) or in landau levels occurring in pairs which are close to one another ( if the spin splitting is very small ) .",
    "some possibilities are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the important parameter here is the ratio of the spin splitting energy to the cyclotron energy .",
    "if this ratio is precisely @xmath60 then all the split landau levels are evenly spaced  at exactly half the cyclotron energy of the spinless case .",
    "experimentally the value is often near @xmath60 , @xcite .",
    "however if the ratio of the spin splitting energy to the cyclotron energy is either very small or near a half ( more generally near an integer or a half integer ) , then the landau levels lie very close to each other in pairs . in this latter case the physics in the upper member of a pair",
    "could well be influenced by the presence of electrons in its lower member .",
    "however , when the pairs are well separated it would seem reasonable to assume that the physics of any _ pair _ is independent of how many pairs below are filled .",
    "this is tantamount to replacing the landau level addition transformation with @xmath61 : @xmath62    there does not seem to be any reason to expect flux attachment to be modified when the spin splitting is small and we shall therefore concentrate on the group generated by @xmath48 and @xmath61 .",
    "this sub - group of @xmath3 is usually denoted by @xmath2 in the mathematical literature and it can can also be described by demanding that both @xmath63 and @xmath49 in ( [ gammadef ] ) be even integers . this group has already received some attention in relation to the quantum hall effect , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is our intention to explore the differences between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , as applied to the quantum hall effect and to the scaling flow of the conductivities in particular . to this end",
    "the next section deals with the relation between the modular group and scaling .",
    "very powerful predictions can be made by combining the two parameter scaling hypotheses of khmelnitskii @xcite , as implemented in @xcite , with modular symmetry of the quantum hall effect .",
    "one assumes that there is a physical length scale , @xmath9 , upon which the conductivities depend  @xmath9 could be the electron scattering length , for example , which diverges as @xmath64 in an infinite system .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that @xmath9 should depend on the external magnetic field @xmath65 and the temperature @xmath22 through a single scaling variable @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the deviation of the external magnetic field from the critical value @xmath68 and @xmath69 is an anomalous dimension .",
    "the derivatives @xmath70 give flow equations for the conductivities , whose integral curves , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are the scaling functions of @xcite .",
    "more generally one would expect the conductivities to depend on more parameters , such as the density of impurities ( integer effect ) or the charge carrier density ( fractional effect ) .",
    "scaling arguments would then lead to the form @xmath73 and @xmath73 for some exponent @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the charge carrier density , for example . thus varying @xmath65 and @xmath22 independently , while keeping @xmath75 fixed , gives two free parameters with which to explore the whole upper - half @xmath15-plane .",
    "alternatively one could keep @xmath65 fixed and vary @xmath22 and @xmath75 .",
    "pruisken s scaling form is recovered at low temperatures , provided the conductivities are well behaved functions of the second argument , which tends to zero as @xmath64 if the exponent @xmath74 is negative and diverges as @xmath64 if @xmath74 is positive . in the following",
    "it shall be assumed that @xmath22 is low enough that the second argument here can be ignored and the conductivities are functions of a single scaling variable , @xmath76 .",
    "more generally one could define @xmath1-functions to be derivatives with respect to a function of @xmath63 , or alternatively one could use filling factors , @xmath77 , and consider derivatives with respect to a function @xmath78 of @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 these latter are clearly not the same as the @xmath1-functions in ( [ betal ] ) .",
    "indeed it may be an abuse of language to call them @xmath1-functions  the integrated form @xmath82 and @xmath83 might be more correctly called scaling functions but we shall continue to use the notation of equation  ( [ betas ] ) since these functions are somewhat analogous to callan - symanzik functions of relativistic quantum field theory",
    ". one of the principle assumptions used in the following is that the action of @xmath3 ( or @xmath2 ) should commute with the flow equations  ( [ betas ] ) , @xcite .",
    "when spin splitting leads to well separated landau levels ( @xmath3 case ) one can make predictions about the global phase diagram in the complex @xmath15-plane and the positions of the critical points in the crossover between two hall plateaux and between a laughlin state and the insulator , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover one can deduce the semi - circle law , @xcite , without making any further assumptions  indeed without recourse to any specific microscopic model .",
    "this law was proposed on the basis of an analysis of a specific microscopic model in @xcite and has strong experimental support @xcite .",
    "there is also a duality for any transition between two hall plateaux at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 odd . and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "in the sequel any mention of a hall - hall transition is implied to include the laughlin state - insulator transition , unless otherwise stated explicitly . ]",
    "this duality is given by parameterizing the semi - circle by @xmath88 in @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 ) and inverting @xmath91 .",
    "for the laughlin state ",
    "insulator transition , this @xmath91 inversion leads to the observed experimental duality @xmath92 under @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "in particular a general formula for the values of the conductivities at the critical points is given by setting @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xcite  these are fixed points of @xmath3 in the sense that there exists an element of @xmath3 that leaves these points invariant .",
    "they are the only such points above the real axis in the complex @xmath15-plane .    by making further assumptions about the form of the scaling functions one can make much more specific predictions about the form of the crossover between two hall states for the @xmath3 case , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "for the @xmath2 case , when spin splitting does not separate the landau levels completely , there has been an analysis of the possible scaling flow too , @xcite,@xcite . though in this case there is no prediction of the critical conductivities for any transitions because the group @xmath2 has no fixed points above the real axis .",
    "however one can still derive the semi - circle law using exactly the same techniques as in @xcite , except applied to @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 , provided one assumes a generalisation for particle - hole symmetry for @xmath2 , @xmath96    to go further in the analysis of a flow compatible with @xmath2 we need to make further assumptions about the form of the @xmath1-functions in  ( [ betas ] ) and in the next section the assumptions and techniques adopted in @xcite for the @xmath3 case will be adapted and modified to further the analysis of @xcite .",
    "in terms of the complex conductivity , equation  ( [ betas ] ) can be written as @xmath97 demanding that the flow described in  ( [ generalbeta ] ) commute with the action of @xmath3 or @xmath2 requires that @xcite @xmath98 this equation follows easily from ( [ gammadef ] ) and the fact that @xmath31 .",
    "to go any further requires making some further assumptions .",
    "various possibilities have been suggested in the literature , @xcite  @xcite , and the line we shall follow is to investigate further the consequences of the assumption that the @xmath1-functions are _ meromorphic _ functions of @xmath15 . unfortunately this assumption has no microscopic justification at the moment , rather it is made on the basis of experience with super - symmetric qcd where the groups @xmath3 and @xmath2 also appear and the @xmath1-function for @xmath99 super - yang - mills theory are meromorphic functions of a complex coupling with positive imaginary part , @xcite @xcite .",
    "there is certainly no evidence for any real connection between the quantum hall effect and super - symmetric qcd , beyond the observation that the same discrete groups crop up as symmetries of the physics in both cases , but it is interesting to apply expertise gained from the occurrence of these groups in the latter framework to the former , just to see what happens .",
    "the occurrence of meromorphic @xmath1-functions in super - symmetric qcd is intimately related to super - symmetry and it is possible that super - symmetry may have a rle to play in the quantum hall effect , @xcite , but this is as yet unclear",
    ". however it may be worth noting in passing that the modular group was discovered in a statistical mechanical model prior to its use in the quantum hall effect @xcite  indeed this work analysed a model which was motivated by ordinary qcd ( i.e. not super - symmetric ) .",
    "a second motivation for the meromorphic assumption , and perhaps more important from a practical point of view , is that there is a very highly developed mathematical literature on the theory of meromorphic functions satisfying equation  ( [ modform ] )  such functions are called modular forms of weight @xmath100 in the mathematical literature  and this puts very strong restrictions on the form of the @xmath1-functions .",
    "thus even though the meromorphic assumption lacks any physical foundation the predictions are extremely strong and thus the assumption is easily falsifiable by experiment  an important aspect of any theoretical analysis .",
    "we shall see , in fact , that experiment agrees surprisingly well with the consequences of this assumption .    for the @xmath3 case it is shown in @xcite that @xmath1-functions satisfying @xmath101 ( with @xmath49 even ) and subject to some further reasonable physical restrictions , must have a precise analytic form in terms of well known classical functions called jacobi @xmath102-functions , @xcite .",
    "the further restrictions are : that the @xmath1-functions should vanish at @xmath103 and @xmath104 as fast as possible in order to explain the fantastic stability of the hall plateaux , which must be attractive fixed points of the flow ; that the @xmath1-functions should be finite as @xmath105  the weak coupling regime of field theory models ; and finally that there are no fixed points other than those mentioned above and those representing the critical point in the transition between any two plateau .",
    "a further assumption used in @xcite , that @xmath17 should be constant as @xmath105 , is in fact not necessary since this is actually a consequence of the other assumptions , @xcite .",
    "the jacobi @xmath102-functions are defined either as infinite sums or as infinite products in the variable @xmath106 , which converge for @xmath107 : @xmath108 and satisfy the identity @xmath109 there is a very special meromorphic function that is _ invariant _ under @xmath3 and is the simplest such function , in the sense that it has the fewest possible number of zeros and poles : @xmath110 satisfies @xmath111 for any @xmath112 .    the unique form of the @xmath1-function ( up to a positive constant ) that is compatible with the above assumptions is obtained in @xcite and is @xmath113 where @xmath114 . of course to make any contact with physics we still have to specify the unknown function @xmath78 that is used to define the @xmath1-functions in ( [ betas ] )  we shall say more about this later .    these ideas were applied to @xmath1-functions compatible with @xmath2 in @xcite but the resulting flow had no evidence of any critical point point in the crossover between two plateau .",
    "we shall therefore re - examine this flow , with a view to introducing such a critical point . to do this recall the physical picture that @xmath3 is the relevant symmetry group when",
    "the landau levels are all well separated .",
    "now imagine varying the relative magnitudes of the spin splitting and the cyclotron energy , for example by varying the land @xmath59-factor or by varying the effective mass of the charge carriers , until the landau levels are paired off into close pairs which are well separated from other pairs , as in figure 1 . in this latter case",
    "the relevant group is @xmath2 .",
    "we thus have a continuous deformation from @xmath3 symmetry to @xmath2 symmetry , and it should be possible to deform the @xmath1-functions for @xmath3 continuously to those for @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis in @xcite requires using the function @xmath115 rather than @xmath116 , since @xmath117 is the appropriate invariant function for @xmath2  @xmath116 is certainly invariant under @xmath2 , since @xmath118 and @xmath116 is invariant under @xmath3 , but it is not the simplest such function .",
    "of course since @xmath116 is invariant under @xmath2 it can be expressed in terms of @xmath117 , explicitly @xmath119 where ( [ thetaidentity ] ) has been used  but one can not express @xmath117 in terms of @xmath116 without introducing branch cuts .",
    "one can thus write the @xmath3 symmetric @xmath1-functions ( [ analyticbeta ] ) in terms of @xmath117 , @xmath120 this has a pole in @xmath117 at @xmath121 , which corresponds to @xmath122 for the transition between the integer quantum hall state at @xmath103 and the insulator at @xmath123 .",
    "of course this pole is reflected at every image of @xmath124 under the action of @xmath3 and thus all the critical points for every quantum hall transition are generated from this one in the transition @xmath125 by the symmetry group .",
    "as discussed at length in @xcite this pole is not a disaster , but is a perfectly regular manifestation of the critical point in the crossover , at @xmath126  this will be discussed in more detail a little later .",
    "the pole at @xmath122 is a feature specific to @xmath3 , it must be there because @xmath124 is a fixed point of @xmath3 , but there is nothing about @xmath2 that dictates the position of the critical point .",
    "it would therefore seem natural to postulate the @xmath2 @xmath1-functions to be the following deformation of the @xmath3 @xmath1-functions : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a sample specific constant .",
    "for well separated , spin split landau levels @xmath129 giving the @xmath3 @xmath1-functions ( [ analyticbeta ] ) , but when pairs of landau levels lies close to each other @xmath128 can deviate from the more symmetric value of @xmath130 . if one assumes particle - hole symmetry @xmath131 of equation ( [ ph2 ] ) the semi - circle law follows and the critical point must lie on the semi - circle spanning @xmath132 and @xmath133 . now",
    "the function @xmath117 is real on this curve and therefore @xmath128 must be real .",
    "in fact @xmath134 on this semi - circle and so @xmath135 for the critical point to lie between @xmath123 and @xmath103 .",
    "equation ( [ betag2 ] ) is easily integrated with respect to @xmath136 to give @xmath137 where @xmath138 is an arbitrary integration constant ( complex in general ) .",
    "since the function @xmath78 is assumed to be real along any flow line the complex phase of the right hand side of the above equation must be constant and equal to the phase of @xmath138 .",
    "thus the trajectory is determined by the phase of @xmath138 and we can easily plot the integral curves of ( [ betag2 ] ) by doing a contour plot of the complex phase of the right hand side of ( [ exps ] ) .",
    "two such plots are shown in figure 2 , the first is for the @xmath3 case , @xmath129 , and has already been presented in @xcite , while the second corresponds to the choice @xmath139 .",
    "the distortion of the flow away from the ideal @xmath3 flow is manifest in the lower figure ( khmelnitskii s original analysis , @xcite , is only compatible with @xmath3 ) .",
    "one of the main points of this paper is to suggest that such a distortion is an inevitable consequence of having landau levels that are not completely spin split .",
    "some such distortion is a likely consequence of any flow , including those that are not meromorphic .",
    "although the quantitative shape of the flow shown in figure 2 does not depend on the unknown function @xmath78 , provided only that it is monotonic , this function must still be specified in order to make further progress . in order to pin this function down , at least for hall - hall crossovers",
    ", consider the semi - circular arches on which @xmath117 is real and greater than unity .",
    "we can always choose @xmath140 at the critical point where @xmath141 , so @xmath142 in ( [ exps ] ) . now note that the flow diagrams in figure 2 are completely unaffected by a rescaling of @xmath78 .",
    "it is @xmath143 that is the physical parameter , so consider @xmath144 .",
    "a rescaling of @xmath136 should not affect the flow diagram therefore @xmath144 must be a scale invariant function of @xmath136 and the only such function is a power law @xmath145 , and so one concludes that @xmath146 , for some real constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this relates to the earlier observation that the @xmath1-functions ( [ analyticbeta ] ) have a pole at the critical values of @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",
    "navely this looks disastrous  a critical point should be associated with a zero of the @xmath1-function not a singularity ! indeed experimentally @xmath17 and @xmath16 are perfectly finite and smooth as the magnetic field passes through @xmath68 ( for finite @xmath22 ) , and @xmath151 is finite at @xmath152 .",
    "however , as emphasised previously , these are not wilsonian @xmath1-functions and the resolution of this problem lies in the exponent @xmath147 . with @xmath153 and @xmath154",
    "we have @xmath155 so , with @xmath151 finite at @xmath152 , @xmath1 will diverge if @xmath156 .",
    "indeed a careful analysis of the analytic form of @xmath1 in equation ( [ analyticbeta ] ) shows that @xmath157 near the critical point @xmath122 and @xmath158 .",
    "this is also true for the spin degenerate form ( [ betag2 ] ) .    the explicit analytic form of @xmath159 , within the framework of the meromorphic ansatz ( [ betag2 ] )",
    "can now be obtained using the same methods as in @xcite .",
    "first express the invariant function @xmath115 in terms of elliptic integrals of the second kind @xmath160 using the classical formulae @xcite @xmath161 ( where the modulus @xmath162 is related to @xmath15 by @xmath163 and @xmath164 , with @xmath165 the complementary modulus ) .",
    "this gives @xmath166 and equation ( [ exps ] ) reads , with @xmath142 , @xmath167 which , for a fixed @xmath128 , defines @xmath168 in terms of @xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath3 , with @xmath129 , this is easily solved to give @xmath169 explicitly , but for a more general value of @xmath128 the relation must remain implicit .",
    "since @xmath170 on the semi - circle spanning @xmath123 and @xmath103 the elliptic integrals for the crossover are complex when written in terms of @xmath162 , which makes it difficult to pick out the real and imaginary parts of @xmath15 from the relation @xmath163 .",
    "so , as in @xcite , this relation is re - expressed in terms of @xmath171 , so that @xmath172 and @xmath173 and @xmath174 are then real , @xmath175}.\\ ] ] this equation , together with the implicit definition of @xmath176 @xmath177 and the relation derived earlier for @xmath136 on the semi - circle @xmath178 completely determine the crossover conductivities as functions of the scaling variable @xmath179 in terms of two unknown , sample specific , constants , @xmath148 and @xmath128 . the exponent @xmath69 is believed to be universal and has been measured to be @xmath180 , @xcite .",
    "the conductivities , and corresponding resistivities , for the integer transition @xmath181 in the @xmath3 case ( @xmath129)were first derived in @xcite and are reproduced here in figure 3 , with the choice @xmath182 and @xmath183 , as functions of @xmath184 at the four different temperatures used in @xcite for this transition .    before comparing these analytic expressions with the experimental data we must address the issue of how the experimental longitudinal conductivity is related to its theoretical cousin",
    "experimentally the longitudinal conductivity can not be measured directly . what is actually measured is the longitudinal and transverse resistances",
    "from which are inferred the longitudinal and transverse resistivities . in two dimensions , of course , resistivities and resistances have the same dimensions but they can still differ by dimensionless geometric factors .",
    "the transverse resistivity and the transverse resistance are identical , independent of any such geometrical factors  a fact which is essential for the accuracy of the hall quantization  but this is not the case for the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath6 and resistance , @xmath7 . when experimental resistivities are quoted it is actually @xmath7 that is measured , together with the length @xmath9 and width @xmath10 of a rectangular sample , and the formula @xmath185 is used to determine the experimental longitudinal resistivity , @xmath186 . as fabrication techniques improve @xmath10 and @xmath9 become more accurately determined and so @xmath186 becomes more accurately measured .",
    "however let us examine equation ( [ rhoexp ] ) carefully and ask what assumptions go into the derivation and how @xmath187 might be related to the @xmath6 that a theoretician might quote .",
    "the derivation of ( [ rhoexp ] ) is extremely simple because the assumptions are grossly over simplified , @xcite . in the absence of any magnetic field",
    "consider a rectangular slab carrying current density @xmath188 running parallel to its long axis , where @xmath189 is the longitudinal voltage driving the current .",
    "using @xmath190 as a cartesian co - ordinate along the width the total current is @xmath191 so @xmath192 , which is equation ( [ rhoexp ] ) .",
    "some important assumptions that go into this derivation are :    * a perfectly rectangular sample .",
    "* electron trajectories which are classical , linear and parallel . *",
    "no perturbations due to source and drain contacts or hall voltage probes .",
    "* neglect of any magnetic fields generated by the currents themselves .",
    "* electrons scatter before reaching the drain .",
    "as fabrication techniques improve the first assumption may be getting better and better but the others are somewhat questionable .",
    "impurities or electron - electron interactions are liable to make electron trajectories deviate from straight lines and the last assumption may break down for very pure samples at low temperatures , for example . a more correct relation between longitudinal resistance and resistivity would read : @xmath193 where @xmath12 is some function of the geometry that tends to unity as @xmath194 , and this is all one can really say . a relation similar to ( [ rhoth ] ) has been studied when an external magnetic field is present in @xcite",
    ", however this analysis suffers from the same difficulties as listed above , and indeed some of these are discussed in that reference .",
    "if @xmath195 is not small we should expect differences between the experimentalist s @xmath186 in equation ( [ rhoexp ] ) and the theoretician s @xmath6 in equation ( [ rhoth ] ) .",
    "if there is such a renormalisation of @xmath6 how can this be reconciled with the experimentally observed semi - circle law , @xcite ? would this not be modified if the experiment had used the wrong normalisation for @xmath6 ?",
    "the answer is yes , in general , but no for laughlin - insulator transitions only  and in fact the best experimental data for the semi - circle law come from the laughlin - insulator transitions , @xcite . rescaling @xmath6 for the laughlin - insulator transitions ( @xmath196 , with integral @xmath197 ) does not affect the semi - circle law because these transitions are described by the semi - circle @xmath198 , @xmath199 , which is mapped to a vertical line @xmath200 in the @xmath14-plane by @xmath52 .",
    "rescaling @xmath201 does not change the nature of these vertical lines and so merely serves to re - parameterise the semi - circle in the @xmath15-plane , but it is still a semi - circle .",
    "this is not true for hall - hall transitions , such as @xmath202 for example .",
    "the semi - circle @xmath203 is mapped to @xmath204 which is also a semi - circle . rescaling @xmath6",
    "would distort this semi - circle into an ellipse in the @xmath14-plane which would then correspond to an ellipse in the @xmath15-plane .",
    "indeed this suggests an alternative technique for determining @xmath6 from the experimental data , which does not rely on ( [ rhoexp ] ) .",
    "if one assumes the law of corresponding states , including the particle - hole transformation , to be a symmetry at low temperatures ( possibly a more plausible assumption than classical , linear trajectories for electrons ) then the semi - circle law follows @xcite . for a hall - hall transition",
    "it has just been shown that there is at most one normalisation of @xmath6 that leads to a semi - circular transition  so if we _ assume _ a semi - circular transition we can use this to determine the normalisation of @xmath6 for a hall - hall transition .",
    "this provides a technique for determining @xmath6 from the resistance @xmath7 which is completely independent of any geometrical factors or assumptions  the only assumption is that the law of corresponding states is a symmetry at low enough temperatures , which is well motivated @xcite .",
    "this will not work for laughlin state - insulator transitions since these correspond to straight vertical lines in the @xmath14-plane , which are always semi - circles in the @xmath15-plane regardless of the normalisation of @xmath6 , but this very fact can be turned to our advantage .",
    "any deviation from a semi - circular arch in the @xmath15-plane for a laughlin state - insulator transition can be interpreted as a sign that the temperature is not yet low enough for the law of corresponding states to be a valid symmetry and this gives a quantitative measure of when the temperature is `` low enough '' for the normalisation of @xmath6 to be fixed for a hall - hall transition .    in the following section we shall compare the analytic predictions of the previous section with the available experimental data , allowing for the possible ambiguity in the normalisation of the experimentally determined value of @xmath186 in laughlin - insulator transitions discussed above .",
    "the analytic prediction of section 4 for @xmath3 , based on the assumption of meromorphicity and derived in @xcite , is reproduced for the transition @xmath205 in figure 3 .",
    "the values of @xmath148 and @xmath69 , as well as the values of the temperature , used here were specially chosen to give a good fit to the data of @xcite and the analytic curves are displayed in conjunction with the experimental data in figure 4 .",
    "the agreement appears to be quite good without any rescaling of @xmath6 , despite the lack of any physical justification for the meromorphic ansatz .",
    "it is to be stressed that there is really only _",
    "one _ adjustable parameter in this fit , the value of the constant @xmath148 which is just a choice of scale for the horizontal axis .",
    "the exponent @xmath69 is not independent , but is measured in this experiment to be @xmath206 so there is only a small leeway available to vary it to fit the curves .",
    "the fit is not perfect but it seems remarkable that it is so good with only one parameter at our disposal ! for the laughlin - insulator transition @xmath207 the theoretical prediction is that the critical resistivity is @xmath208 while the experimental data indicate a value some 30% larger than this .",
    "so we use the freedom to re - scale @xmath186 discussed in the last section to argue that the true normalisation for @xmath6 is such that the critical point _ should _ be at unity and re - scale the theoretical @xmath6 by @xmath209 to obtain figure 5 , which is super - imposed on the experimental data in figure 6 . again",
    "the temperatures are chosen to agree with those used in the actual experiment , but this time the value @xmath210 is found to give the best fit ( there is no reason to expect @xmath148 to be universal ) .",
    "the same sample was used in these two experiments , so the interpretation suggested here requires a different normalisation for @xmath6 in the two transitions .",
    "this could be accommodated , for example , by postulating a @xmath65 dependence in the geometrical function @xmath116 of equation ( [ rhoth ] ) , causing @xmath116 to vary by 30% as @xmath65 is increased by a factor of three , which is the ratio of the critical fields in the two transitions , but with @xmath116 being fairly constant under variations of @xmath65 of order 10% , which is the range depicted in the experimental transitions .",
    "a second experiment , with excellent support for a semi - circular transition , is that of hilke et al . , @xcite .",
    "in this experiment the critical point in the @xmath211 transition is most certainly not at @xmath212 .",
    "two possible explanations of this are are : i ) the landau levels come in closely related pairs , so that the symmetry group is @xmath2 with @xmath213 and not @xmath3 ; ii ) the group is @xmath3 but the experimental @xmath186 differs from the theoretical one by a factor of @xmath214 .",
    "using the predictions of the meromorphic ansatz we can test these two hypothesis and by far the most successful is the latter  it is simply impossible to get a good fit with the former assumption while the theoretical curves for the latter , after increasing @xmath6 by 1.7 , are shown in figure 7 and compared to the experimental data in figure 8 .",
    "the data here are plotted against @xmath65 rather than @xmath18 and converting @xmath18 to @xmath65 requires knowing the charge carrier density . in terms of the magnetic field , @xmath215 , equation ( [ sdef ] )",
    "gives the relation between @xmath65 and the scaling variable @xmath136 @xmath216 where @xmath217 is related to the constant @xmath148 in equation ( [ sdef ] ) by @xmath218 , with @xmath219 the critical filling factor .",
    "the best value of @xmath217 to fit the data of @xcite is @xmath220 while the optimal value of @xmath69 is @xmath221 which is certainly a little low for comfort , but is just compatible with three standard deviations of the value in @xcite ( no experimental value for @xmath69 is quoted in the paper @xcite , so we work with the value given in @xcite , because this is believed to be universal ) .",
    "the highest temperature at @xmath222k is a very poor fit , but all the experimental evidence is that this temperature is too high for @xmath3 symmetry to be valid  there is strong deviation in the experimental data away from the semi - circle law at this temperature too .",
    "so again the agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions of the meromorphic ansatz is very good , provided one re - scales @xmath186 and assumes @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the actual values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in this sample are @xmath223 m and @xmath224 m so @xmath225 is small but not really close to zero .    of course just because one analytic suggestion appears to give a good fit to the experimental data",
    "does not mean that it has to be the correct one .",
    "the experimental data for the transition @xmath226 can also be fitted by an exponential , @xcite , but when this is done it appears to indicate that scaling , and therefore super - universality , may be in trouble .",
    "the authors of @xcite fit the form @xmath227 to their experimental data , where @xmath228 is a function of @xmath22 to be determined .",
    "they find that @xmath229 is incompatible with the data for any @xmath69 and suggest instead a linear form , @xmath230 with @xmath231 and @xmath232 non - zero constants .",
    "since @xmath233 gives the best fit this is interpreted as a violation of the scaling hypothesis .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that it may be possible to recover scaling with a different functional fit  in particular the form suggested here in terms of elliptic integrals seems promising  but a definitive answer would require a quantitative analysis , such as a @xmath234-fit , which would require access to the actual experimental numbers rather than just the figures in @xcite",
    ". an important difference between the exponential and the elliptic integral forms is that , near the hall plateau at which @xmath235 , @xmath236 for the former while @xmath237 in the latter .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish visually between these two possibilities with the current data .",
    "returning to the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 all the experimental data considered here are well described with @xmath3 .",
    "it would be very interesting to see good experimental crossover curves at different temperatures for samples with very small spin splitting , at temperatures low enough for the semi - circle law to be valid over a range of temperatures .",
    "the arguments given in section two would imply that it may be @xmath2 that is relevant then rather than @xmath3 and the sample dependent parameter @xmath128 , which parameterizes the position of the critical point , would have to be taken from experiment rather than coming as a prediction from the symmetry .",
    "it has been argued that the rich duality structure of the quantum hall effect , as embodied in the infinite order discrete non - abelian group @xmath3 , which is the mathematical description of the law of corresponding states , should be modified when the landau levels are organized into close pairs , for example when the spin splitting is small relative to the cyclotron energy .",
    "this modification requires replacing @xmath3 with the smaller , but nevertheless still infinite order , group @xmath2 . in terms of the law of corresponding states",
    "this replacement is equivalent to replacing the landau level addition transformation , @xmath238 , with @xmath239 .",
    "the derivation of the semi - circle law from duality symmetry is still valid if one assumes that the particle - hole transformation of the spin split case , @xmath240 , is replaced with @xmath241 .",
    "the main difference between the groups @xmath3 and @xmath2 is that for the later the critical point in the crossover between two hall plateaux ( or between a laughlin state and the insulating phase ) is no longer fixed by duality , as it is in @xmath3 case , but can be anywhere on the semi - circle spanning the two states in the complex @xmath15-plane .",
    "this results in a distortion of the flow diagram shown in the lower diagram of figure 2 .",
    "the experimental data often show a critical point in the crossover which is not at the point predicted by @xmath3 symmetry , i.e. at @xmath242 for the hall - hall transition @xmath202 .",
    "two possible causes of this are investigated here : i ) it is due to the breaking of @xmath3 to @xmath2 or ii ) it is due to a renormalisation of the experimentally determined longitudinal resistivities so that they do not coincide with their theoretical values . without any further assumptions one can not distinguish between these two possibilities .    with the added assumption that the @xmath1-function described in section three",
    "are meromorphic functions of the complex conductivity an analytic form is obtained for @xmath243 and @xmath244 . for the @xmath2 case",
    "there are two free parameters in the resulting expression , equations ( [ analyticba])-([sdef ] ) , apart from the exponent @xmath69  these correspond to the normalisation of the horizontal axis in figure 3 and the angular position of the critical point in the crossover",
    ". for integer transitions the critical point lies at the top of the semi - circle when the larger symmetry @xmath3 is relevant but can be anywhere on the arch for the smaller group @xmath2 .",
    "however a simplified analysis of the relation @xmath245 , used to determine the longitudinal resistivity from the experimentally measured longitudinal resistance , shows that it should only be considered to yield the correct normalisation for @xmath6 in the limit @xmath246 .",
    "it is suggested that a more reliable technique for determining the correct normalisation is to ascertain the temperature range for which the laughlin - insulator transition is semi - circular and to assume that the semi - circle law is also valid for hall - hall transitions in this regime .",
    "this would then fix a unique value for the ratio @xmath247 for the hall - hall transitions .",
    "a comparison with some of the available experimental data , gives very good fits ( figures 4 , 6 , and 8) for @xmath3 duality  provided one renormalises the experimental value of @xmath6 , at least for the laughlin - insulator transitions .",
    "this author is not aware of any experimental data in support of the breaking of @xmath3 to @xmath2 but , if the ideas presented here are correct , it ought to be possible to see this breaking in samples where the spin splitting is small and the temperature is low enough for the semi - circle law to be valid .",
    "the main difficulty with the present analysis is of course the ad hoc assumption of meromorphic @xmath1-functions .",
    "there is no theoretical justification for this assumption , either microscopic or mesoscopic , but in view of the remarkable agreement with experiment that it produces ( figures 4 , 6 , and 8) it would seem to merit some consideration .",
    "the assumption of complex analyticity is a very natural one in the context of super - symmetric gauge theories , where the groups @xmath3 and @xmath2 also manifest themselves as duality symmetries , but this is a consequence of super - symmetry in these models .",
    "while it is not impossible that super - symmetry may be relevant to the quantum hall effect it is certainly not established and probably not accepted by most workers in the field .",
    "the original motivation for testing an analytic ansatz was simply mathematical elegance and it is certainly a surprise that it seems to give answers that agree so well with experiment .",
    "nevertheless it seems worthwhile pursuing this hypothesis in the light of said agreement and a possible physical justification for complex analyticity of the @xmath1-functions is currently under investigation .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the theoretical physics group , institute for nuclear physics , orsay , where most of this work was carried out , for their hospitality and in particular yvon georgelin for useful discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank cliff burgess for helpful discussions on crossover in the quantum hall effect .",
