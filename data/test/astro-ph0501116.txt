    "the process of backscattering and fluorescence of x - rays from cosmic matter known as x - ray reflection is commonly observed throughout astronomy .",
    "we are concerned here with the situation where the x - ray irradiation is so intense that it determines the ionization state of the material .",
    "this occurs in accreting x - ray sources such as galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and may also be relevant to gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "the irradiated gas is compton thick , which requires that comptonization of the radiation as well as the necessary atomic physics be dealt with .",
    "results of such computations have been published over the last ten years , first for constant - density atmospheres ( ross & fabian 1993 ; ycki et al .",
    "1994 ; ross , fabian & young 1999 ) and more recently for density structures in hydrostatic equilibium ( nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ; raska et al .  2002 ; mauche et al .",
    "reasonable agreement is found between most of these results ( pquignot et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "most methods are computationally very time consuming , so only limited regions of parameter space have been explored .",
    "our method runs relatively rapidly , on the other hand , when the illuminated gas is assumed to have constant density .",
    "such models are still useful for several reasons .",
    "the overall geometry is still not understood for many sources .",
    "even when a simple accretion - disc structure is assumed , detailed calculations of hydrostatic equilibrium are subject to uncertainties in the total thickness of the disc ( and hence the vertical component of the local gravitational field ) , the boundary condition ( either pressure or height ) at the base of the illuminated layer , the external pressure exerted by the corona , the geometry of the illumination , the influence of magnetic fields , etc .",
    "furthermore , ballantyne et al .  ( 2001 ) found that models for reflection by atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium could be fit by diluted versions of constant - density reflection models .",
    "we have now assembled an extended grid of models for which the ionization parameter , irradiating spectral index and iron abundance are free parameters . at the same time",
    "the original code has been expanded to include further ionization species .",
    "all abundant species and their important transitions are now included .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present example spectra from across this grid which can be used as a guide to the interpretation of agn , bhc and grb x - ray spectra .",
    "our calculations extend and improve on the models discussed by ross , fabian & young ( 1999 ) . now",
    "the illuminating radiation is assumed to have a cutoff power - law spectrum , @xmath3 that extends to higher photon energies .",
    "different values of the photon index @xmath4 are treated , while the cutoff energy is fixed at @xmath5 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath6 is chosen so that the total illuminating flux , @xmath7 , corresponds to a desired value of the ionization parameter , @xmath8    the illumination is incident on the upper surface of a plane - parallel slab representing the top layer of an optically thick medium such as an accretion disc .",
    "the slab has hydrogen number density @xmath9 and thomson depth @xmath10 .",
    "( larger thomson depths are treated for larger values of @xmath11 , since the illumination can penetrate to greater depths when the gas is more highly ionized . )",
    "no net flux is allowed to enter the slab from below , so that the emergent radiation is due entirely to reprocessed illumination ( `` reflection '' )",
    ". additional radiation from beneath the surface layer could be approximated by adding a soft blackbody spectrum to the calculated reflection spectrum ( see section 4 ) .",
    "as described by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) , the penetration of the illuminating radiation is treated separately from the transfer of the diffuse radiation produced via scattering or emission within the gas . in order to extend the treatment of the diffuse radiation to photon energies above 100 kev",
    ", compton scattering is treated using the fokker - planck equation of cooper ( 1971 ) : @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the photon occupation number , @xmath13 is the photon energy , @xmath14 is the free - electron number density , and @xmath15 . here",
    "the fokker - planck equation of kompaneets ( 1957 ) has been modified by the term @xmath16 with @xmath13 in kev and with @xmath17 equation  ( 3 ) is applicable for @xmath18 .",
    "the diffuse radiation field is taken to satisfy the steady - state fokker - planck / diffusion equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vertical height within the slab , @xmath21 is the spectral emissivity , @xmath22 is the total opacity ( per volume ) , @xmath23 is the absorption opacity , and @xmath24 is the klein - nishina opacity for compton scattering .",
    "we apply equation  ( 6 ) to radiation with @xmath25 .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath26 throughout the 0.110 kev spectral range ( except for a resolution of 70 around the iron k@xmath27 lines ) , with somewhat lower resolution outside that range .",
    "as the radiation field is relaxed to a steady state , the local temperature and fractional ionization of the gas are found by solving the equations of thermal and ionization equilibrium , as described by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) .",
    "for this non - lte calculation , we have extended the number of elements and the range of ions treated , and we have updated much of the atomic data employed .",
    "in addition to fully - ionized species , the following ions are included in the calculations : ciii  vi , niii ",

    "we employ the probabilities for multiple auger ionization calculated by kaastra & mewe ( 1993 ) , and a generalization of the method of weisheit ( 1974 ) is used to calculate the resulting effect on the ionization balance .    for all elements except iron ,",
    "total recombination rates as functions of density and temperature are derived from the tables of summers ( 1974 ) .",
    "these rates include two effects that are important at high densities : the increase in the recombination rate at low temperatures due to three - body recombination and the reduction in the dielectronic recombination rate at high temperatures due to collisional ionization of the highly excited states that follow radiationless recombination ( burgess & summers 1969 ) . at low densities , these rates are in reasonable agreement with more modern fits for combined radiative and dielectronic recombination ( arnaud & rothenflug 1985 ) . for iron , rates for radiative and dielectronic recombination",
    "are calculated using the fits of arnaud & rothenflug ( 1985 ) and verner & ferland ( 1996 ) .",
    "three - body recombination of iron is neglected , since it is unimportant at the densities under consideration ( jacobs et al .",
    "rates for radiative recombination directly to ground levels are calculated using the milne relation ( e.g. , bates & dalgarno 1962 ) .",
    "the most important emission lines for each ion are treated in the calculations . since the illuminated atmosphere is thick and dense , resonance lines are assumed to be optically thick ( `` case b '' ) , greatly reducing the number of important lines .",
    "a total of 274 multiplets are included ; individual lines within a multiplet are not resolved .",
    "line energies and oscillator strengths for resonance lines are taken from the results of the opacity project ( verner , verner & ferland 1996 ) .",
    "excitation and line energies of nonresonance lines , as well as collision strengths for all lines , are derived from the chianti database ( dere et al .",
    "parameter values missing from these databases are taken from kato ( 1976 ) , raymond & smith ( 1977 ) , gaetz & salpeter ( 1983 ) , or landini & monsignori fossi ( 1990 ) , as necessary .",

    "xxii is assumed to be suppressed by autoionization ( auger effect ) during resonance trapping ( ross , fabian & brandt 1996 ) .",
    "recombinations to excited levels of fexvii  xxii are assumed to result ultimately in @xmath28 line emission ( liedahl et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "resonance lines require special attention .",
    "resonance - line photons can avoid destruction during resonance trapping by two mechanisms : compton scattering out of the narrow line core between resonance scatterings and reemission in the far line wings during resonance scattering .",
    "the fraction avoiding destruction is taken to be @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the thomson opacity , @xmath31 is the total continuum opacity at the line energy , @xmath32 is the probability per resonance scattering that the photon undergoes a continuum process ( absorption or compton scattering ) , and @xmath33 is the probability per resonance scattering that collisional deexcitation occurs instead of reemission ( hummer 1968 ) .",
    "the escape probability @xmath34 due to reemission in the far line wings ( hummer & rybicki 1971 ) is calculated using the approximation for the @xmath35 function given by hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) . a doppler line profile is assumed for all resonance lines except the fe k@xmath27 line , where a lorentz profile is assumed due to the importance of the damping wings .",
    "line photons that avoid destruction during resonance trapping are added to the continuum by means of the local emissivity .",
    "elements lighter than iron are assumed to have solar abundances ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , while the abundance of iron is set to a factor @xmath36 times its solar value .",
    "models are generated with underabundances as well as overabundances of iron .",
    "on the one hand the x - ray spectra of some seyfert galaxies appear to require high abundance of iron , for example mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( fabian et al .  2002 ) and 1h0707 - 49 ( boller et al .",

    "they point out that their code has the drawback of being time - consuming , which precludes it from easily generating large grids of models for fitting data .",
    "in particular , they have applied their method to an _ isolated _ slab that is illuminated on one side .",
    "the total thomson depth of the slab is @xmath45 , and the illuminating flux corresponds to @xmath46 ergcms@xmath47 . as a test of our method",
    ", we have performed our own computation for this situation .",
    "we can not expect complete agreement because our calculations assume that helium is always fully ionized .",
    "normally our interest is in reflection by a highly optically - thick medium . in order for all of the incident energy to escape back out the illuminated surface , the total radiative energy density increases with thomson depth to such a degree that the assumption that helium is fully ionized should be satisfactory .",
    "when radiation is free to leave the far surface of a marginally thick slab , however , helium need not be fully ionized throughout .",
    "dumont et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a large fraction of he@xmath48 ions at depths @xmath49 .",
    "our calculation of the isolated slab serves mainly as a test for the lyman-@xmath27 lines of hydrogen - like ions , which are produced in the hotter layers nearer the illuminated surface .",
    "0.25 cm     the biggest change required for this model is in the boundary condition at the far side of the slab .",
    "diffuse radiation is allowed to emerge there , with the escaping flux calculated in the same way as at the illuminated surface ( see foster , ross & fabian 1986 ) .",
    "other changes must also be made to the method described previously .",
    "the gas density is reduced to @xmath50 .",
    "the illuminating spectrum is a simple power law with photon index @xmath51 extending from 0.1  ev to 100  kev , and the energy resolution is fixed at @xmath52 .",
    "the metal abundances are set to the values of allen ( 1973 ) , which differ slightly from those of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature structure and the ion fractions for oxygen and silicon that we calculate for the isolated slab .",
    "for @xmath53 , our results are in good agreement with those of dumont et al .",
    "the differences at greater thomson depth are presumably due to the lack of he@xmath48 in our model .    the reflected spectrum that we calculate for the isolated slab is shown in figure  2 .",
    "dumont et al .",
    "( 2003 ) concluded that use of the escape probability must result in a drastic overestimation of the strength of the lyman-@xmath27 lines of hydrogen - like ions .",

    "in particular , the o  viii line has an equivalent width of 27  ev with respect to the total ( incident plus reflected ) continuum , compared to their value of 28  ev . for the si  xiv line , which is complicated by a steeper underlying continuum and blending with the he - like line",
    ", we estimate an ew of 14  ev compared to their value of 9.5  ev . in our calculations , compton scattering of resonance - line photons out of the narrow line core turns out to be much more important than reemission in the far line wings . that is , the first term of the numerator in equation  ( 7 ) completely dominates over the second term .",
    "the fe k@xmath27 line is somewhat stronger in our calculation .",
    "since it is dominated by the fe  xxv intercombination line ( 6.7 kev ) , however , this is probably due to different approximations in treating the atomic physics .",
    "curiously , we find the lyman-@xmath27 line of n  vii ( 0.50 kev ) to be weaker than found by dumont et al .",
    "differences can be seen in other emission lines , but these are produced deeper within the slab , where he@xmath48 could be a factor .",
    "2 also shows the calculated spectrum emerging from the far side of the slab . because of the lack of he@xmath48 , the euv portion of the transmitted spectrum cuts off at a higher energy than found by dumont et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "overall , our method appears to give reasonably accurate results , with computing times short enough to allow the production of a large grid of reflection models for fitting to observed x - ray spectra .",
    "for an optically - thick medium , we have calculated model reflection spectra covering a range of values for the ionization parameter ( @xmath54 , 100 , 300 , 1000 , 3000 , and 10000 ergcms@xmath47 ) , the photon index ( @xmath55 to 3.0 in steps of 0.2 ) , and the iron abundance ( @xmath56 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 5.0 , and 10.0 ) relative to its solar value .",

    "more euv radiation emerges than for pure reflection , as expected , but the x - ray spectrum is essentially unchanged .",

    "<S> x - ray ionized reflection occurs when a surface is irradiated with x - rays so intense that its ionization state is determined by the ionization parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the incident flux and @xmath2 the gas density . </S>",
    "<S> it occurs in accretion , onto compact objects including black holes in both active galaxies and stellar - mass binaries , and possibly in gamma - ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> computation of model reflection spectra is often time - consuming . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the results from a comprehensive grid of models computed with our code , which has now been extended to include what we consider to be all energetically - important ionization states and transitions . </S>",
