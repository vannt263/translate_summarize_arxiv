    "superposition of states and entanglement make quantum information processing much different from its classical counterpart .",
    "but a quantum state would unavoidably interact with its environment , resulting in a degradation of coherence and entanglement .",
    "for example , spontaneous emission in atomic qubits @xcite would spoil the coherence of quantum states and limit the entanglement time .",
    "recent experimental advances have enabled individual systems to be monitored and manipulated at quantum level @xcite .",
    "this makes the quantum feedback control realizable . among the feedback controls ,",
    "the homodyne - mediated feedback @xcite and quantum - jump - based feedback controls have been proposed to generate steady state entanglement in a cavity @xcite .",
    "these two feedback schemes are markovian , namely , a feedback information proportional to the quantum - jump detection is synchronously used . besides , these control scheme can also be used to suppress decoherence @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , researchers are looking for proper systems for experimental implementation of quantum information processing . among the various candidates , solid - states quantum devices based on superconductors @xcite and lateral quantum dots @xcite are promising ones , however , the decoherence from intrinsic noise originating from two - level fluctuators is hard to engineered @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the nuclear spins have attracted considerable attention @xcite due to its long coherence times @xcite .",
    "but their weak interactions to others make the preparation , control , and detection on them difficult .",
    "thanks to its intrinsic interactions with electron spins , electron spin can be used as an ancilla to access single nuclear spin .",
    "this naturally leads us to rise the following question : can feedback strategy be used to suppress decoherence , prepare and protect entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins by controlling the electron spin ? in this paper , we will study this problem by considering a nuclear spin ( as a qubit ) coupled to electron spin ( as the other qubit ) that is exposed to its environment .",
    "we show that a markovian feedback based on quantum - jump can be used to suppress decoherence , produce entanglement and protect it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we describe our model and present the dynamics in absence of feedback . in sec.iii",
    ", we introduce the quantum - jump - based feedback control and give the dynamical equation under the feedback control .",
    "the effect of feedback control on decoherence and entanglement is discussed in sec.iv and sec.v , respectively .",
    "sec.vi concludes our results .",
    "our system consists of a pair of two - level systems , called qubit 1 and qubit 2 , where only the qubit 2 interacts with its environment .",
    "we present a scheme employing quantum - jump - based feedback control on the qubit 2 to affect the decoherence of the qubit 1 and increase entanglement between the two qubits .",

    ". the decoherence process can be showed by the decay of off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix for the first qubit .    in order to investigate this decoherence",
    ", we calculate the evolution of system density operator @xmath8 and then trace out the second qubit to get the reduced matrix @xmath16 the diagonal elements are the populations in the excited and ground states of the first qubit . and the off - diagonal elements represent the coherence of the qubit 1 .",

    "the second qubit is used as an ancilla through which the feedback can affect the dynamics of the first qubit , i.e. , by employing a feedback control on the second qubit , we control the first qubit .",
