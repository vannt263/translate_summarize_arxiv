    "barred spiral galaxies are ideal laboratories for the study of star formation because they host a variety of environments with distinctive star formation activity and gas dynamics .",
    "these environments include the circumnuclear , inner and outer rings ( see discussion of rings in @xcite ) , the bar ends , and the bar region itself , located in between the bar ends and the nucleus . from region to region , the star formation activity can vary dramatically : bars have star formation rates of @xmath10.10.4 @xmath2yr@xmath3  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas in circumnuclear rings , in an area 10 - 30 times smaller , star formation rates may be as high as 1 @xmath2yr@xmath3(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "since star formation occurs in molecular clouds , comparative studies of the distribution of molecular gas and star formation activity in different environments can shed light on how star formation may be induced or inhibited .    along the spiral arms , for example",
    ", observations find that the molecular gas and hii regions are usually not co - spatial ; hii regions are preferentially offset towards the leading side of the molecular gas or dust lanes @xcite .",
    "this offset is interpreted as evidence of star formation induced by a spiral density wave @xcite .",
    "however such offsets are not universally present . in m100 ,",
    "@xcite find that the offset is absent , or even inverted , along the spiral arms .",
    "still , in other cases , the offset is more pronounced between the hii regions and the dust lanes as the molecular gas and dust lanes diverge ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "attribute the divergence to heating of the gas by young stars or cosmic rays , or to a two - phased molecular gas medium , but admit that neither of these explanations works satisfactorily .    in barred spirals ,",
    "most previous studies comparing the molecular gas distribution and star formation activity have focused on the highly active circumnuclear region ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , we focus on the unique region between the bar ends and the nucleus .",
    "this region is unlike any other in the galactic disk because it is dominated by highly elliptical stellar orbits ( see reviews by @xcite ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to it simply as the _ bar_.    only one previous study has studied the location of hii regions relative to the stellar bar @xcite ; they found that the `` h@xmath0  bar '' was usually offset towards the leading side of the stellar bar with misalignments as large as 15@xmath4 .",
    "studies of molecular gas or dust in bars have found that the gas and dust are also on the leading side of the stellar bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the relationship between the molecular gas ( or dust ) and star formation has only been studied in a few cases . in m101 , for example , @xcite note that the molecular gas and h@xmath0  emission are at the same position angle .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that the hii regions in the bar of ngc 5383 are offset towards the leading side of the bar dust lanes .",
    "it is unclear whether such offsets are common in bars .",
    "since bars have distinctive ( and well - studied ) gas kinematics , a study of the relative distribution of the gas and stars can further elucidate the complex phenomenon of star formation . with this goal ,",
    "we have studied six barred spirals from the recently completed bima survey of nearby galaxies ( song ) @xcite .    the sample selection is discussed in  [ sample ] , and the observations and data reduction in  [ obs ] . using the co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission line to trace the molecular gas , and the ionized hydrogen ( h@xmath0  ) line to trace recent star formation activity , we compare the relative distribution of the two in  [ qual ] . in all six galaxies",
    "we find that the majority of the h@xmath0  emission is offset towards the leading side of the molecular gas .",
    "we quantify the offset using one and two dimensional cross - correlation analysis in  [ quant ] .",
    "the co - h@xmath0  offset constrains how stars may form depending on the gas flow into the dust lane .",
    "we discuss the results of the cross - correlation analysis in the framework of the two main classes of bar gas flow models ( the n - body sticky particle and hydrodynamic models ) in  [ disc ] , and summarize our results in  [ conc ] .      in bima song ( see details of the survey in @xcite ) , we detect co emission in 27 of the 29 barred spirals ( e.g. , figures a1 and a2 in @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the emission is detected in the circumnuclear region , where it is usually the brightest . in some bars",
    ", co emission is also detected at the bar ends , along the bar , and even in inner rings @xcite .",
    "since we are mainly interested in studying star formation in the bar region we limit ourselves to those bima song galaxies in which _ both _ co and h@xmath0  emission are clearly detected over a significant portion of the bar .",
    "six galaxies satisfy this criterion : ngc 2903 , ngc 3627 , ngc 4321 , ngc 5457 , ngc 6946 and ic 342 .",
    "global properties of these six are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "though small , our sample spans a range of hubble types with 1 sb , 2 sbc and 3 scd galaxies .",
    "this range may be important because most of the observed differences in star formation activity in bars occur between early and late hubble type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , early hubble type bars have low star formation activity along the bar and high star formation activity at the bar ends , whereas late hubble type galaxies have higher star formation activity in the bar , but have a gap in star formation at the bar ends @xcite .",
    "all the galaxies in our sample are classified as sab in the rc3 catalog .",
    "however this does not mean that they are all weak bars because the hubble classification of sab types is not rigorous ; in fact , a recent analysis of infrared data has shown that the true fraction of strong bars may be as high as 56% , higher than the typically quoted 33% in the rc3 @xcite .",
    "the strength of a bar may be correlated with its hubble type .",
    "@xcite concluded that early hubble type galaxies have stronger bars because these bars are longer , relative to their disks , and have flat profiles ; these galaxies also have strong spiral arm patterns .",
    "however , bar strength is a difficult parameter to quantify ; other structural properties such as the bar ellipticity and bulge size are also important ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a good indicator of the bar strength is the shape of the bar dust lanes because it reflects the gas response to the stellar bar .",
    "@xcite showed that strong bars have relatively straight dust lanes whereas weaker bars have curved dust lanes . extending her analysis to our sample , we infer that ngc 2903 and ngc 3627 are strongly barred because of their straight dust lanes .",
    "ngc 5457 and ngc 4321 with slightly curved dust lanes are weaker bars .",
    "ic 342 has an even more curved dust lanes indicating an even weaker bar . in ngc 6946",
    ", the northern dust lane appears to be straight but the southern dust lane is curved so it is difficult to classify this bar solely on the shape of the dust lanes .",
    "@xcite suggest that if there is bar in ngc 6946 , it is rather weak . using bar dust lanes as a measure of bar strength , we find that the three latest hubble types in our sample are classified as relatively weak bars . in summary",
    ", our sample contains a broad range of bar strengths , from strong bars in ngc 2903 and ngc 3627 , to intermediate strength bars in ngc 4321 and ngc 5457 , to relatively weak bars in ngc 6946 and ic 342 .",
    "all six galaxies were observed in the co ( j=10 ) emission line with the bima ( berkeley - illinois - maryland association ) array and the nrao 12 m single dish telescope as part of the bima song key project .",
    "the 44 galaxy song sample was chosen with the following criteria : heliocentric velocity , v@xmath5 @xmath6 2000 km  s@xmath3 , declination , @xmath7 -20@xmath8 , inclination , @xmath9 70@xmath8 , and apparent magnitude , b_t@xmath6 11 .",

    "further details of the data acquisition and reduction can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc  2903 , ngc  3627 and ngc  4321 at the 0.9 m telescope at kitt peak on the nights of 46 april 1999 , with the t2ka 2048@xmath122048 ccd camera in f/13.5 direct imaging mode . in this mode",
    "the camera has a 13@xmath131 field of view with 0@xmath14384 pixels . in the broad band r - filter",
    ", we took three exposures of 180s each , and in the h@xmath0  filter ( @xmath15 = 6573  , @xmath16 = 67  ) we took three exposures of 100140s each .",
    "we divided each frame by a normalized flat - field frame and combined the resulting frames into one single image for each corresponding filter .",
    "then from these images we subtracted the mean sky brightness , and removed cosmic rays using standard routines in the noao / iraf software package .",
    "we also corrected all images for atmospheric extinction .",
    "finally , we registered foreground stars in each image with the hubble guide star catalog ( gsc ) and determined astrometric solutions for each image .",
    "the residuals in determining absolute positions were smaller than 0@xmath142 ; however , systematic errors in the gsc prevent us from achieving an accuracy @xmath6 1@xmath10 .",
    "we used the r - band image to subtract the underlying continuum from the h@xmath0  image .",
    "we observed ic  342 at the 1.5 m telescope at palomar on the night of 19 november 1999 with the maryland - caltech fabry - perot camera .",
    "these data were reduced and calibrated using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0  image for ngc 6946 is also a similar velocity - integrated h@xmath0  fabry - perot map obtained previously at palomar .",
    "a broadband continuum image and a continuum - subtracted h@xmath0  image for ngc 5457 were supplied to us by r. kennicutt ; these images have 2@xmath146 pixels compared to 0@xmath1438 pixels for the other optical images .",
    "we first consider the relative distribution of the molecular gas and star formation activity in the six galaxies by overlaying the co emission on the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0  images ( figures [ 2903olay][ic342olay ] ) .",
    "our goal is to learn where the stars may be forming by comparing the relative locations of molecular clouds and hii regions .",
    "since any image is only a snapshot in time it is difficult to assign a star forming region to its parent molecular complex .",
    "we make the usual assumption that co traces regions most prone to star formation , and h@xmath0  traces young stars most likely to have formed in molecular gas complexes traced by the co.    in every image we show the extent of the stellar bar , as determined by @xcite , with an ellipse .",
    "the ellipse corresponds to the outermost bar isophote and was determined from fitting ellipses to optical or near - infrared images following a method devised by @xcite .",
    "the width of a bar is a difficult parameter to measure accurately because contamination by bulge light tends to make the fitted ellipses wider @xcite . since the minor axis length is not relevant for the study presented here , we chose a representative minor axis that is one - quarter that of the major axis for all bars except ic 342 , which has a small , oval bar for which we chose a minor axis that is one - half that of the major axis .",
    "in each image ( figures [ 2903olay][ic342olay ] ) we show co contours overlaid on a grey - scale image of the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0  emission .",
    "we describe the distribution of h@xmath0  and co using approximate position angles because their morphology is often curved .",
    "compact h@xmath0  structures are labeled with a prefix h , and co features are labeled with a prefix c. we also show the direction of rotation of the bar with a curved arrow symbol in the lower right hand corner ; the direction is based on the assumption that spiral arms trail in galaxies . all the galaxies in our sample rotate counter - clockwise except for ngc 6946 .    in all six galaxies",
    "we find that the co emission is brightest on the leading side of the stellar bar .",
    "overlays of the co maps on optical - infrared color maps ( not shown ) confirm that the molecular gas generally coincides with the bar dust lanes @xcite . in five out of the six galaxies ,",
    "weak spurs of co emission are seen on the trailing ( upstream ) side of the dust lanes . at",
    "the bar ends , bright co emission is present on the leading and trailing sides ; this gas is most likely associated with inner rings , which often encircle bars @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission is distributed in bright , compact structures and weak , diffuse emission .",
    "the differences in bar star formation activity noted by @xcite are not always present .",
    "for instance , both the early hubble type bar in ngc 3627 and the late hubble type bar in ngc 5457 have relatively little star formation activity , whereas strong activity can be seen in the bar of ngc 2903 .",
    "but such differences across hubble type are difficult to quantify with this small sample . in these six bars , while there are a few cases where h@xmath0  is coincident with , or on the trailing side of co , _ all six _ show that majority of the h@xmath0  emission is offset towards the leading side of the co emission .",
    "we describe these results for each individual galaxy in detail below :    _ ngc 2903 ( figure [ 2903olay ] ) _ : the stellar bar in ngc 2903 is oriented at a position angle ( pa ) of 24@xmath4 east of north .",

    "the solid circles on the deprojected h@xmath0  and co images are the boundaries within which the cross - correlation is done . the inner radius is chosen to best avoid the circumnuclear emission and the outer radius is at the end of the bar ( corresponding to the bar ellipse in figure [ 2903olay][ic342olay ] ) .",
    "the dashed circles are typically spaced at integral multiples of 10@xmath10 and the corresponding radius is shown with a solid , horizontal line in the one dimensional cross - correlation diagrams in the right hand panel .    the cross - correlation result can be affected by systematic dust extinction . for example , consider a barred spiral where the h@xmath0  emission is distributed evenly on the trailing and leading sides .",
    "the cross - correlation peak of such a distribution should not show any azimuthal offset .",
    "however , if the h@xmath0  on the trailing side of the dust lane is obscured by a screen of dust , then the cross - correlation diagram would show that the h@xmath0  is preferentially on the leading side of the dust lane .",
    "but as noted earlier in [ qual ] this is unlikely because the dust extinction on the trailing side is very low as gas piles up in the dust lanes .",
    "note that any extinction suffered by the h@xmath0  in the dust lane only increases the observed offsets ; so the co - h@xmath0  offsets calculated here are upper limits .",
    "it is important to understand whether the cross - correlation peak depends on small , bright structures , like the h@xmath0  and co peaks , or on large , diffuse , and dim features .",
    "we performed two tests to address this question .",
    "first , we flagged all low level emission in the co and h@xmath0  maps of ngc 2903 and cross - correlated the images in radius and azimuth .",
    "we found that the cross - correlation peak was essentially unchanged .",
    "the main difference was that a background of small but non - zero correlation values , present in the original cross - correlation diagram , was now removed .",
    "the diffuse emission , therefore , is analogous to a constant offset contributing to the correlation diagram , but at no particular lag .",
    "this test indicates that the cross - correlation peak is determined primarily by the bright peaks in the maps .    as a second test",
    ", we set all emission above an arbitrary bright signal value to that signal value in the h@xmath0  and co maps for ngc 2903 , approximating the removal of bright peaks . in the resulting correlation diagram",
    "there was a trend of h@xmath0  offset azimuthally towards the leading side from the co but the cross - correlation peak moved significantly from its original location and became broader .",
    "the larger width of the peak was expected because we removed the sharpness inherent in the maps being correlated .",
    "the shift , once again , showed that the location of the correlation peak is primarily determined by bright h@xmath0  and co peaks . assuming that these peaks trace regions most prone to star formation , and recently formed ob associations respectively",
    ", the correlation peak effectively quantifies the offset between parent molecular gas complexes and newly formed stars .      in every bar ( right hand panels in figures [ n2903all][ic342all ] )",
    ", we find that the peak of the cross - correlation shows h@xmath0  azimuthally offset towards the leading side of the co emission , consistent with the discussion in  [ qual ] . in these panels , we have annotated the correlation peaks with the notation used in figures  [ 2903olay][ic342olay ] for the corresponding co and hii regions .",
    "the offset between the annotated regions varies from 0800 pc with a range of offsets in any given bar .",
    "we find that the largest offsets are generally seen in the strongest bars .",
    "for instance , in ngc 2903 , offsets of @xmath1800 pc are seen in the northern half between c2 & h5 , and between h4 , h5 & the northern part of c1 . in the same bar ,",
    "smaller offsets are also present between c3 & h6 ( @xmath1400 pc ) , and between c1 & h1 ( @xmath1200 pc ) . in the slightly weaker bars ,",
    "ngc 4321 and ngc 5457 , the hii regions are typically offset 200 - 500 pc ( e.g. , c1 & h1 in figure [ n4321all ] ) , and in the weakest bars , ngc 6946 and ic342 , the offsets are even smaller , typically less than 400 pc .    at some radii ,",
    "the cross - correlation peak is at larger distances , exceeding a kiloparsec in some cases .",
    "these are instances where only weak , and diffuse h@xmath0  emission is being correlated with the co emission .",
    "an example of this is seen between 2025@xmath10 in ngc 3627 ( figure [ n3627all ] ) . in a few cases we get non - physical values for the cross - correlation peaks",
    "; this occurs when we correlate either noise features or weak emission that is well outside the bar .",
    "the arrows point towards the non - physical value of the cross - correlation peak , off the scale shown in these figures .",
    "though there appears to be a relationship between the bar strength and the co - h@xmath0  offset , there is no _",
    "systematic _ pattern in the offset as a function of the galacto - centric radius .",
    "we often see a trend of increasing offsets of h@xmath0  from co over radial extents of 510@xmath10 , e.g. , the radial bins between 3842@xmath10 ( c2 & h5 ) in figure [ n2903all ] .",
    "this trend is due to beam smearing and subsequent deprojection of the images .",
    "these results are discussed further in  [ disc ] .",
    "the two - dimensional correlation results are plotted in the bottom panel in figures  [ n2903all][ic342all ] . in these panels ,",
    "the intersecting straight lines indicate the 0,0 lag position .",
    "positive ( negative ) correlation values indicate h@xmath0  offset radially inwards ( outwards ) or azimuthally leading ( trailing ) the co. unlike in the one - dimensional analyses , where we only correlated 1@xmath10 annuli , the location of the cross - correlation maximum ( or maxima ) in the two - dimensional analyses is susceptible to bright emission near the circumnuclear or bar - end regions because we sum over the whole bar region .",
    "while we did our best to choose an inner boundary to avoid most of the circumnuclear emission , the outer boundary sometimes included bar - end / spiral arm emission ( for instance , in ngc 2903 ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the two dimensional cross - correlation results are less reliable than the other analyses presented here .",
    "another is the possibility of getting incorrect results because we may correlate physically unrelated peaks .",
    "suppose the brightest hii region is at the outer bar end whereas the brightest co peak is at the inner bar end .",
    "then the cross - correlation peak will be at the radial lag at which these peaks overlap .",
    "but these regions are most likely unrelated .",
    "though we restricted the radial lag space to avoid such extreme situations , one must treat the two dimensional cross - correlation results with caution",
    ".    in all six galaxies , the h@xmath0  is leading the co emission in the azimuthal direction .",
    "in other words , the correlation values are higher on the right hand side of the bottom panel .",
    "this is consistent with the overlays (  [ qual ] ) and the one - dimensional cross - correlation analyses (  [ oned ] ) .",
    "we also find that , in almost all cases , there are higher cross - correlation values for h@xmath0  offset radially outwards from the co. in four galaxies ( ngc 2903 , ngc 3627 , ngc 6946 and ic 342 ) , the maximum of the cross - correlation values is located at outward radial lags of @xmath17 - 10@xmath10 .",
    "these large offsets are not obvious in the overlays of co and h@xmath0  images , and may not be physically meaningful because , as discussed above , the correlation is between h@xmath0  and co peaks along the dust lane .",
    "how can one explain the co - h@xmath0  offset ?",
    "if there was no relative motion of the gas and stars , then the co and h@xmath0  should be co - spatial .",
    "however , since the majority of the h@xmath0  emission is preferentially on the leading side of co in all six bars , gas dynamics must play a role .",
    "hence , we consider the two main classes of bar gas flow models : a ) n - body / sticky particle models which treat the gas as a collection of sticky particles , reacting to a gravitational field , and exchanging angular momentum and energy upon collisions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and b ) grid - based hydrodynamic models which treat the gas as an isothermal , ideal fluid obeying standard hydrodynamic equations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the framework provided by these models to understand the observed co - h@xmath0  offsets .",
    "the addition of single dish ( nrao 12 m ) on - the - fly data to the bima interferometric observations greatly reduced the problem of spatial filtering . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the combined data , such as those presented here , recovers 80 - 90% of the flux density for all sources of size @xmath6 10@xmath10 , with the recovery improving for smaller scales . at the mean distance to these six galaxies ( 8.25 mpc ) ,",
    "10@xmath10 subtends a linear scale of 400 pc , much larger than a typical giant molecular cloud ( @xmath14050 pc , @xcite ) , and larger than most giant molecular complexes or associations ( @xmath1100 - 400 pc , @xcite ) .",
    "so these data do not suffer greatly from the spatial filtering of an interferometer .",
    "the sensitivity of these observations is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we summarize the main points here . given our typical rms noise of 58 mjy beam@xmath3 , we have a rms column density sensitivity of 4.6 @xmath2  pc@xmath20 , using a co / h@xmath21 conversion factor of 2@xmath1210@xmath22 cm@xmath20 ( k km  s@xmath3)@xmath3 in a 10 km  s@xmath3channel .",
    "the data quality is such that the edges of extended emission are probably reliable at 2@xmath24 or 9.1 @xmath2  pc@xmath20 , and isolated points are reliable at 3@xmath24 or 13.7 @xmath2  pc@xmath20 . for comparison ,",
    "the mean surface density of a galactic giant molecular cloud in the solar neighborhood is 50100 @xmath2  pc@xmath20 @xcite , within an area of 2.1 @xmath12 10@xmath25 pc@xmath26 . assuming that this surface density is typical for molecular gas",
    ", we are sensitive to clouds with typical masses @xmath1 10@xmath27 @xmath2  in a single beam , or in other words , we would detect large molecular clouds in a single beam but our observations would not detect a 10@xmath28 @xmath2cloud . hence it is possible that we are not detecting molecular gas from small , weak clouds that may be associated with the observed hii regions .",
    "this caveat applies throughout our discussion .",
    "our analysis is focussed on the observed offset between the co and h@xmath0  emission .",
    "the basic assumption is that these observations trace the highest surface density co emission , i.e. , the regions most prone to star formation activity . in the next two sections ,",
    "we discuss how star formation may occur given the gas flow in the n - body / sticky particle and hydrodynamic models .",
    "the n - body / sticky particle simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) are designed to emulate the behavior of bound , molecular clouds , the basic organizational unit of the molecular interstellar medium . however , these models parameterize the physics involved by using ad  hoc equations for simulating the collisions and energy exchange . though they have been successful at reproducing curved dust lanes and rings @xcite , they are unable to reproduce the sharp velocity jumps and straight dust lanes observed in strongly barred spirals .    in these models ,",
    "the bar dust lane results from orbit crowding , similar to a spiral arm dust lane ( see figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "gas clouds in these models crowd together and probably form giant molecular complexes in the dust lane ; they eventually leave the dust lane diverging outwards on the leading side of the bar . if stars form in the molecular complexes , as suggested for the spiral arm of m51 @xcite , then we naturally expect h@xmath0  emission to be both in the dust lane and downstream from it .",
    "thus , these models naturally fit the observed co - h@xmath0  offset seen in our sample .",
    "they may also explain the presence of h@xmath0  emission on the trailing side of the dust lane by arguing that , as the clouds gradually converge on the trailing side they may collide , form complexes , and form stars .",
    "also as noted by @xcite , the molecular gas clouds are difficult to detect on the leading ( downstream ) side of the dust lane because the average gas surface density decreases as the clouds diverge outwards from the dust lane .",
    "these models can not easily explain the radially outwards h@xmath0  offset seen in the two dimensional cross - correlation diagrams because , over most of the bar , the cloud orbits have a radially inwards component as clouds converge towards the dust lane .",
    "in contrast to the n - body / sticky particle models , hydrodynamic simulations use standard fluid equations to model the gas but the gas is usually an isothermal , ideal fluid .",
    "though self - gravity and magnetic fields have not been included in the past , newer models have begun to incorporate these as well ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the n - body / sticky particle models , the hydrodynamic models have been successful , not only at reproducing the observed gas kinematics @xcite , but also the entire range of observed bar dust lane shapes , from curved to straight @xcite .",
    "the gas kinematics in these models are dramatically different ( see figure 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "the gas streamlines diverge as they approach the dust lane @xcite . at the dust lane ,",
    "_ all _ of the gas is redirected inwards by a hydrodynamic shock such that _ none _ of the gas crosses the dust lane .",
    "historically , the bar dust lanes , despite their high gas density , are regarded as inhospitable environments for star formation because of high shear ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite have also argued that the diverging streamlines on the trailing side of the dust lane can tear apart molecular clouds , or at least prevent molecular complexes from forming ( but note that self - gravity can counteract this effect , see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "these studies argue effectively for reduced star formation efficiency in the dust lanes .",
    "even if stars form in the dust lane , the gas flow dictates that stellar clusters travel down the dust lane .",
    "thus these models can not naturally explain the azimuthal offset between the h@xmath0  and the co. in this model gas flow , the only way for the hii regions to appear on the leading side of the dust lanes is to form stars on the trailing side while the gas still has tangential motion .",
    "such a mechanism was proposed in a previous study of the barred spiral ngc 5383 . in that bar",
    ", @xcite noted that the limited number of hii regions , all on the leading side of the dust lane , were directly across from faint dust spurs .",
    "they proposed that , in this bar , stars were forming in spurs because spurs were regions of high gas density and low shear .",
    "spurs are faint and difficult features to detect . though we see some spur - like co features , the correlation between hii regions and spurs requires more sensitive co observations . a more practical approach would be to first trace the spurs with high quality ( resolution and sensitivity ) optical - infrared color maps to understand their locations , structure , and frequency .",
    "then a targeted study with sensitive co observations can help us better understand the relationship between spurs , co and h@xmath0  . though possible , we feel that it is unlikely that all star formation in bars occurs in spurs",
    ". however we note that , if stars form in the spurs , then the radially outwards offset can be naturally explained because the gas streamlines diverge outwards on the trailing side of the dust lanes in this model .    in summary",
    ", both gas flow models can explain the co - h@xmath0  offsets but neither is satisfactory , especially when we consider these and previous observations of bars .",
    "one possible improvement , especially to the hydrodynamic models , could be the use of a multi - phased molecular medium , consisting of a diffuse , gravitationally unbound phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the usual dense , bound phase made of giant molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in a bar , diffuse gas may be formed by the disruption of clouds by the tidal field of a bar , or by off - center cloud - cloud collisions @xcite . at least in one bar ,",
    "ngc 7479 , tentative evidence of diffuse gas has been presented @xcite .",
    "the diffuse gas has a higher velocity width than the bound phase , and so it may dominate the co kinematics . perhaps this is why studies of gas kinematics in the dust lane have been consistent with the hydrodynamic models ( e.g , @xcite ) . and",
    "it may be that the star forming component of the gas , the dense , bound clouds , behaves more like the sticky particles in n - body simulations .",
    "previous spiral arm studies found h@xmath0  offset from the co by a few hundred pc @xcite .",
    "vogel et al . (",
    "1988 ) immediately recognized that this offset was too large given that typical `` drift '' velocity of a cloud across a spiral arm is @xmath1 10 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "they suggested that stars may be forming after a `` gestation '' period of a few million years following the compression of clouds by the spiral density wave .",
    "the situation is different in the bar environment . in the n - body / sticky particle model for bars ,",
    "the orbit crowding is much more severe than for a spiral arm shock , and it is non - trivial to calculate an equivalent `` drift '' velocity across the bar dust lane .",
    "the offsets observed along most of the bar dust lanes ( 0500 pc ,  [ onedres ] ) are similar to those observed along spiral arms . therefore if the drift velocity in bars is similar to that in spiral arms , similar `` gestation '' periods are necessary in the framework of the n - body / sticky particle gas flow model .",
    "however in one or two locations along bars in ngc 2903 and ngc 3627 , we measure offsets as large as @xmath1 800 pc .",
    "then for the star formation scenario presented here in the framework of n - body / sticky particle gas flow model , either unusually large gestation periods and/or large drift velocities are required .",
    "one observational test may be to measure speeds of newly formed clusters using stellar absorption lines to better understand the dynamics .",
    "another possibility is that for these particular cases , our basic assumption that these stars formed in the dust lanes is not applicable ( see caveat in  [ det ] ) .    in the framework of the hydrodynamical models there is no `` drift '' velocity because all of the gas is redirected inwards by the shock .",
    "suppose the newly formed stars inherit the speed of their parent molecular clouds .",
    "then to traverse the _",
    "entire _ range of offsets seen in these bars ( 0800 pc ,  [ onedres ] ) , the velocity for a stellar cluster must be 080",
    "km  s@xmath3 , assuming a time scale of 10 myr for the h@xmath0  peaks .",
    "individual hii regions have lifetimes @xmath1 3 myr @xcite but since we do not resolve individual hii regions at these distances , we assume a larger lifetime for the h@xmath0  peaks because they are most likely a collection of hii regions .",
    "the relative speed of clouds entering the bar pattern is high . though difficult to quantify ,",
    "a few direct measurements of bar pattern speeds indicate values between 5065 km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic models which try to reproduce observations use a bar pattern speed of 3035 km  s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 @xcite , but these bars are longer than typically observed . in any case , both the models and observations indicate that bars end at @xmath180% of their co - rotation radius , consistent with the findings of @xcite .    using this empirical relationship , and deprojected bar lengths ( table 5 from @xcite )",
    ", the bar pattern speeds in 5/6 galaxies were measured using co rotation curves by @xcite to be : 68 km  s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 ( ngc 2903 ) , 55 km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 ( ngc 3627 ) , 35 km  s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 ( ngc 4321 ) , 71 km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 ( ngc 5457 ) , and 55 km  s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 ( ngc 6946 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the direct measurements of bar pattern speeds in other galaxies .",
    "the pattern speed of the bar in ic342 is difficult to estimate because the bar parameters are not well - known .",
    "we estimated a bar length of @xmath158@xmath10 ( 0.6 kpc ) .",
    "for this bar length , the pattern speed from the co rotation curve is 196 km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , an unrealistically high value .",
    "if instead we use a length of 4@xmath11 as suggested by @xcite , and assume that the rotation curve remains flat at @xmath1 141 km  s@xmath3 , then the bar pattern speed would be a more reasonable 81 km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 .",
    "we do not use ic 342 in the ensuing discussion .",
    "the speed at which a molecular cloud enters is the difference between the disk and bar pattern speeds .",
    "hence , at the mid - points of these bars , cloud speed varies from 4999 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "so in the context of the hydrodynamical models , if a stellar cluster forms from clouds upstream of the shock , it would inherit a velocity of this magnitude .",
    "the velocity of the clouds upstream of the shock is primarily tangential to the bar dust lane .",
    "hence , while the gas is redirected inwards down the dust lane , newly formed stellar clusters continue on the original orbits , and the observed range of offsets is consistent with the expected cloud speeds . however , we emphasize that the range of co - h@xmath0  offsets in a bar is not correlated with the galacto - centric radius .",
    "this suggests that star formation is not a simple function of the parent cloud speed , or alternatively a function of the shock strength .",
    "consistent with this conclusion is the range in offsets observed in a single bar which suggests that star formation depends on other factors , e.g. , gas surface density , and/or local shear .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of molecular gas and star forming regions in the bars of six spirals from the bima survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows : + 1 .",
    "the co emission is brightest along the leading edges of the bar .",
    "weak spurs of co emission are seen on the trailing side of the dust lanes .",
    "these spurs may play a role in star formation upstream of the dust lane . at",
    "the bar ends , strong co and h@xmath0  emission are seen on the trailing and leading sides ; these may be the beginnings of inner rings .",
    "the h@xmath0  emission is distributed in compact and diffuse structures .",
    "there are a few instances where the h@xmath0  is coincident with , or on the trailing side of the co emission .",
    "but the main result is that in all six cases , the majority of the h@xmath0  emission is offset towards the leading side of the co.    \\3 .",
    "we quantify the offsets using a cross - correlation analysis and find a range of 0800 pc , with larger offsets in stronger bars .",
    "however , in a given bar there is a range of offsets and there is no systematic pattern as a function of the galacto - centric radius .    \\4 . in the two dimensional cross - correlation analysis",
    ", there is a tendency for the h@xmath0  emission to be offset radially outwards from the co emission .",
    "however , this trend is less significant than the azimuthal offsets because correlations in two - dimensions can be between physically unrelated hii and co regions .",
    "the observed co - h@xmath0  distributions may be explained by either the n - body / sticky particle models or the hydrodynamic models with different , plausible , star formation scenarios . in the context of the n - body simulations",
    ", stars may form via cloud - cloud agglomeration in the dust lanes . in the context of the hydrodynamic models ,",
    "the stars could form in dust spurs on the trailing side of the dust lane .",
    "we suggest that addition of a two - phased or multi - phased molecular medium can improve the agreement between these and previous observations , and gas flow models in bars .",
