    "the effect of pressure on the propagation of elastic waves in materials is essential for understanding interatomic interactions , mechanical stability of solids , phase transition mechanisms , material strength , and the internal structure of the earth and other planets .",
    "however , little is known of the elasticity of solids at high pressure .",
    "the experimental study of the elasticity of materials under high pressure is challenging , as traditional methods have been applied only to moderate pressures .",
    "ultrasonic measurements are generally limited to a few gpa @xcite , while brillouin spectroscopy has been applied up to 25 gpa @xcite .",
    "we investigate the elasticity of three hexagonal transition metals at high pressure : iron , rhenium , and cobalt .",
    "high pressure properties of iron are of considerable geophysical interest as the earth s solid inner core is composed primarily of this element .",
    "the elasticity of hcp iron is important for understanding the elastic anisotropy of the inner core @xcite , and its super - rotation @xcite .",
    "rhenium is the strongest metal known at high pressure @xcite and is widely used as a gasket material in diamond anvil cell experiments .",
    "we have chosen cobalt for this study because of its proximity to iron in the periodic table and as an example of a ferromagnetic hcp metal .",
    "all three of these metals have been studied experimentally under high pressure and their equations - of - state are well known .",
    "iron transforms from the bcc phase at ambient conditions to hcp near 13 gpa @xcite ; the equation - of - state of the hcp phase has been measured up to 300 gpa @xcite . recent advances in diamond anvil cell techniques",
    "have made it possible to evaluate the lattice strain in a polycrystal subjected to a non - hydrostatic stress field which can be associated with elastic constants .",
    "the elasticity of iron has been inferred by this method at high pressure ( up to 210 gpa ) @xcite .",
    "the equation - of - state of cobalt has been measured up to 80 gpa @xcite and its elastic constants were obtained at zero pressure using traditional ultrasonic methods@xcite . in the case of rhenium the equation - of - state is known to 215 gpa @xcite , its elastic constants and their pressure derivatives have been ultrasonically measured at low pressure@xcite . the same experimental method for evaluating lattice strains as in hcp iron has been applied to rhenium in the pressure range 18 - 37 gpa @xcite .    iron has been studied widely with first - principles theoretical approaches because of its geophysical importance and the well known failure of the local density approximation ( lda ) to the exchange - correlation potential to predict the ferromagnetic bcc ground state @xcite .",
    "this failure was a major impetus in the development of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "the equation - of - state of hcp iron under lda and gga is well known to high pressures@xcite and its elastic constants have been calculated by the full - potential linearized muffin - tin orbital method ( fp - lmto)@xcite , and a total energy tight - binding ( tb ) method @xcite . for hcp cobalt calculations",
    "have been performed with the lmto method in the atomic sphere approximation for lda @xcite and the linearized combination of atomic orbital method ( lcao ) for gga @xcite .",
    "there is no previous theoretical work on the elastic constants of hcp cobalt . for rhenium",
    "only one study has focused on the hcp phase at high pressure @xcite ; using fp - lmto with lda the equation - of - state and the elastic constants at zero pressure have been calculated .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "section [ meth ] elaborates the computational details of our first principles calculations and our approach to calculating the elastic constants , the elastic wave velocities , and the acoustic anisotropy .",
    "it is followed by a section presenting our results on the magnetic state of the materials studied , their @xmath0 ratios , the equation - of - state , and the elastic constants as functions of pressure .",
    "we compare our results in terms of the elastic wave velocities to high pressure experiments and the earth s inner core . in section [ dis ]",
    "we analyze the elastic anisotropy resulting from our calculations , recent experimental and theoretical results , and the predictions from a central nearest neighbor force model",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "we investigate the energetics of hcp iron , cobalt , and rhenium using the full - potential linearized - augmented plane - wave method ( lapw ) @xcite with both lda and gga approximations to the exchange - correlation potential . for lda the form of hedin and lundquist @xcite and von barth and hedin @xcite",
    "are used for non - magnetic and spin - polarized calculations , respectively . for gga",
    "we adopt the efficient formulation of perdew , burke , and ernzhofer @xcite .",
    "core states are treated self - consistently using the full dirac equation for the spherical part of the potential , while valence states are treated in a semirelativistic approximation neglecting spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we investigate ferromagnetic alignment in spin - polarized calculations for all metals and antiferromagnetism for iron . for consistency of the results",
    "all parameters in the calculations except for spin - polarization are kept fixed .    for the @xmath1 metals @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and",
    "@xmath5 states are treated as valence electrons for all volumes .",
    "for rhenium we treat all electrons up to @xmath6 as core , @xmath7 and @xmath8 as valence states . for rhenium",
    "we also have tested other configurations , such as including the @xmath6 as valence states , which did not change our results significantly .",
    "the muffin - tin radii @xmath9 are 2.0 bohr for the @xmath1 metals , and 2.3 bohr for rhenium . as spin - orbit coupling of the valence electrons is important for the band structure and other properties of heavy elements ,",
    "we consider the influence of the spin - orbit term on the equation - of - state for re by including it in a variational step@xcite .",
    "we carry out total energy calculations over a wide range of volumes for all three metals ( 0.7 @xmath10 - 1.2 @xmath10 , with @xmath10 the zero pressure volume ) . at each volume",
    "we determine the equilibrium ratio of the lattice constants @xmath0 by performing calculations for several different values of this ratio .",
    "the equation - of - state is obtained by describing the energy - volume curve with a third order expansion in the eulerian finite strain@xcite .",
    "we have performed convergence tests with respect to brillouin zone sampling and the size of the basis set , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the largest reciprocal space wave - vector in the basis set .",
    "converged results are achieved with a 12x12x12 special k - point mesh @xcite , yielding 114 k - points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone for the hcp lattice , and up to 468 k - points for the monoclinic lattice used in elastic constants calculations .",
    "the number of k - points in the full brillouin zone is well above the convergence criterion for elastic constant calculations established by fast et al .",
    "the size of the basis set is given by @xmath13 , yielding 158 to 311 basis functions , depending on volume .",
    "careful convergence tests show that with these parameters relative energies are converged to better than @xmath14 mry / atom , magnetic moments to better than @xmath15 @xmath16/atom , and @xmath0 to within 0.025 .",
    "we calculate the elastic constants as the second derivatives of the internal energy with respect to the strain tensor ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we choose the applied strains to be isochoric ( volume - conserving ) which has several important consequences : first , we assure the identity of our calculated elastic constants with the stress - strain coefficients , which are appropriate for the calculation of elastic wave velocities ; this identity is non - trivial for finite applied pressure @xcite .",
    "second , the total energy depends on the volume much more strongly than on strain ; by choosing volume conserving strains we obviate the separation of these two contributions to the total energy .",
    "third , the change in the basis set associated with the applied strain is minimized , thereby minimizing computational uncertainties .",
    "we obtain the elastic constants at the equilibrium relaxed structure at any volume @xmath18 by straining the lattice , relaxing the symmetry allowed internal degrees of freedom , and evaluating the total energy changes due to the strain as a function of its magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath20 is calculated by differentiating the equation - of - state . for hexagonal crystals @xmath20",
    "is the combination of elastic constants @xmath21/c_s,\\ ] ] with @xmath22 the volume dependence of the optimized @xmath0 is related to the difference in the linear compressibilities along the @xmath23- and @xmath24-axes ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath27 describes this as @xmath28 in terms of the elastic constants , @xmath29 we calculate @xmath30 by varying the @xmath0 ratio at a given volume , according to the isochoric strain @xmath31 the corresponding energy change is @xmath32 in the expressions for @xmath30 , @xmath20 , and @xmath27 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 occur only as a sum . to separate these constants we determine their difference , @xmath35 by applying an orthorhombic strain , space group _",
    "cmcm_. for the strained lattice we use the two atom primitive unit cell , with the atoms in the wyckoff position @xmath36 , coordinates ( @xmath37,@xmath38,1/4 ) .",
    "the strain is @xmath39 leading to a change in total energy : @xmath40 in the unstrained lattice the atomic coordinate is @xmath41 , but varies under strain@xcite .",
    "we relax our calculations with respect to this internal degree of freedom .    to determine @xmath42 we use a monoclinic strain , space group @xmath43 .",
    "the atomic positions in the two atom primitive unit cell are @xmath44 .",
    "the strain applied @xmath45 results in an energy change @xmath46 the equilibrium positions of the atoms are unaffected by this strain and do not need to be redetermined.@xcite    while for @xmath47 and @xmath42 the leading error term is of the order @xmath48 , for @xmath30 it is of third order in @xmath19 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to include positive and negative strains in the calculation for @xmath30 .",
    "the strain amplitudes applied are typically nine values of @xmath19 covering @xmath49 4% for @xmath30 ; for @xmath47 and @xmath42 , seven values of @xmath19 ranging to 6% are applied .",
    "the elastic constants are then given by the quadratic coefficient of polynomial fits to the total energy results ; the order of the polynomial fit is determined by a method outlined by mehl @xcite .",
    "from the full elastic constant tensor we can determine the shear modulus @xmath50 according to the voigt - reuss - hill scheme@xcite and hence the isotropically averaged aggregate velocities for compressional ( @xmath51 ) and shear waves ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 the density .",
    "more generally , the acoustic velocities are related to the elastic constants by the christoffel equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fourth rank tensor description of elastic constants , @xmath57 is the propagation direction , @xmath58 the polarization vector , @xmath59 is the modulus of propagation and @xmath60 the velocity .",
    "the acoustic anisotropy can be described as @xmath61}{m_i[100]},\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the extremal propagation direction other than @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 is the index for the three types of elastic waves ( one longitudinal and the two polarizations of the shear wave ) . solving the cristoffel equation for the hexagonal lattice one can calculate the anisotropy of the compressional ( @xmath65 ) wave as @xmath66 for the shear waves the wave polarized perpendicular to the basal plane ( @xmath67 ) and the one polarized in the basal plane ( @xmath68 ) have the anisotropies @xmath69 while for @xmath68- and @xmath65-waves the extremum occurs along the @xmath24-axis , for @xmath67 it is at an angle of 45@xmath70 from the @xmath24-axis in the @xmath23-@xmath24-plane .",
    "we note that an additional extremum may occur for the compressional wave propagation at intermediate directions depending on the values of the elastic constants .",
    "we find a stable ferromagnetic state only in cobalt .",
    "it is stabilized over a wide volume range with the magnitude of the moment decreasing with pressure in agreement with previous theoretical results on the pressure dependence of magnetic moments @xcite in other transition metals . only at the smallest volume considered ( 50 bohr@xmath71 , 180 gpa )",
    "is the moment vanishingly small ( fig .",
    "lda and gga yield consistent results and predict a zero pressure magnetic moment of 1.55 @xmath72 , in excellent agreement with experiment ( 1.58 @xmath72 @xcite ) .    in the case of hcp iron ,",
    "we also investigate two antiferromagnetic states .",
    "the first consists of atomic layers of opposing spin perpendicular to the @xmath24-axis ( afmi ) .",
    "the other arranges the planes of opposite spins normal to the @xmath63 $ ] direction in the hcp lattice ; this can be described by the orthorhombic representation of the hcp unit cell ( space group @xmath73 ) with spin up in the @xmath74 and spin down in the @xmath75 position ( afmii ) .",
    "we find that both structures are more stable than the non spin - polarized state and that afmii is energetically favored over afmi . for both antiferromagnetic states the moment is strongly pressure dependent . for afmi it vanishes at volumes larger than @xmath10 ( fig .  [ mm ] ) , in excellent agreement with results of asada and terakura @xcite .",
    "the other structure , afmii , possesses a magnetic moment well into the stable pressure regime of hcp iron , up to @xmath76 40 gpa .",
    "[ mm ] ) . because of frustration on the triangular lattice , it is possible that more complex spin arrangements such as incommensurate spin waves as for fcc iron @xcite or a spin glass are still more energetically favorable than afmii .    diamond anvil cell in situ mssbauer measurements of hcp iron@xcite have shown no evidence of magnetism in the hcp phase .",
    "the low antiferromagnetic moment we calculate in the stable hcp regime and the significant hysteresis of the bcc - hcp transition @xcite might explain that no magnetism in hcp iron has been detected in the high pressure mssbauer experiment . in this context",
    "it may be relevant that indirect evidence for magnetism exists at low pressure .",
    "epitaxally grown iron - ruthenium superlattices have shown magnetism occurring in hcp iron multilayers@xcite .",
    "its character , however , is still controversial @xcite",
    ".      for all materials studied the @xmath0 ratio agrees with experimental data to within 2% and is essentially independent of the exchange correlation potential ( gga or lda ) .",
    "ratios for iron range from 1.58 at zero pressure to 1.595 at 320 gpa .",
    "this is consistent with experimental measurements@xcite in the range of 15 to 300 gpa , which have shown considerable scatter . for cobalt",
    "the zero pressure @xmath0 ratio is calculated as 1.615 , increasing to 1.62 at a pressure of almost 200 gpa .",
    "the zero pressure @xmath0 is slightly lower than the experimental value of 1.623 @xcite .",
    "diamond anvil cell experiments have found a higher value of @xmath0 , as much as the ideal value ( 1.633 ) @xcite , this discrepancy might be due to the coexistence of hcp and metastable fcc cobalt in the polycrystalline sample @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio for rhenium ( 1.615 ) does not change over the whole pressure range studied - and is in good agreement with experimental results ( 1.613)@xcite .      for the equation - of - state of rhenium",
    ", lda shows better agreement with experimental data than does gga ( fig .",

    "gga overestimates the zero pressure volume and softens the bulk modulus , supporting a general pattern seen in prior density functional calculations using gga for other @xmath7 metals @xcite .",
    "including spin - orbit coupling in the calculation has little effect on the equation - of - state parameters , resulting in less than 1% change in the zero pressure volume and 2% in the bulk modulus . for cobalt ,",
    "as for other @xmath1 metals gga is superior to lda and reproduces the experimental equation - of - state to within 2% in volume and 10% in bulk modulus ( fig .",

    "the discrepancy in the equation - of - state parameters of hcp iron between non spin - polarized calculations and experiment is significantly larger than for the other two metals studied here ( table [ eos_table ] ) or other transition metals @xcite .",
    "the zero pressure volume is underestimated by @xmath76 9% , and the zero pressure bulk modulus is too stiff by 75% ( table [ eos_table ] ) . especially at low pressure",
    "the non - magnetic equation - of - state deviates considerably from experimental values , while at high pressure the agreement is very good ( fig .",
    "[ eos ] ) .",
    "the stabilization of antiferromagnetic states at low pressure can account for some of the discrepancy .",
    "for afmii magnetism persists to volumes smaller than @xmath10 , resulting in a larger zero pressure volume , reducing the difference with experiment to 5% , and lowering the bulk modulus considerably ( table [ eos_table ] ) .",
    "this is still larger than the difference in @xmath10 for cobalt and for cubic iron phases ( @xmath77 3% ) @xcite .",
    "we attribute the remaining discrepancy between low pressure experimental data and the afmii equation - of - state ( fig .",
    "[ eos ] ) to the approximations in gga and the possible stabilization of more complex spin arrangements than those considered here .",

    "this is partly related to the overestimated bulk modulus in the calculations .",
    "the largest discrepancy , as in the case of rhenium , occurs in the shear elastic constants ( @xmath42 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "aggregate properties such as the bulk and shear modulus , and the compressional and shear wave velocity are in somewhat better agreement between the theoretical results and the lattice strain experiment for both rhenium and iron ( figs .",
    "[ re_v_p ] and [ v_p ] ) . for rhenium , theory and experiment differ by less than 15% in bulk and shear modulus ( fig .  [ re_v_p ] ) . for iron",

    "the shear modulus differs by 25% even at high pressure .    for iron the comparison with previous theoretical results",
    "gives a more coherent picture . while the longitudinal elastic constants from our calculations are larger by 10 - 20% compared to tb@xcite and fp - lmto results @xcite ( table [ fe_cij ] ) , the elastic anisotropy is similar : the pairs of longitudinal , shear , and off - diagonal elastic moduli display similar values . for the tb study",
    "this is true over the whole pressure range considered , for the fp - lmto calculations only at low pressure ; the ratio of the off - diagonal constants ( @xmath80 ) is strongly pressure dependent in that study , varying from 0.9 at zero pressure to 0.6 at 400 gpa .",
    "we find that the elastic anisotropy ( eqs .  [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) is similar for all three metals studied here .",
    "the magnitude of the anisotropy is 10@xmath492% for the longitudinal anisotropy and @xmath81 , and 30@xmath493% for @xmath82 and is nearly independent of pressure ( fig .",

    "this is consistent with the experimentally observed behavior of other hcp transition metals , all of which - except for the filled @xmath83-shell metals zinc and cadmium - show anisotropy of similar magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ aniso ] ) .    these results can be understood by comparison to a hcp crystal interacting with central nearest neighbor forces ( cnnf ) @xcite . for this model",
    "the elastic anisotropy is independent of the interatomic potential to lowest order in @xmath84 , hence the anisotropy is dependent on the symmetry of the crystal only .",

    "the experimentally determined elastic anisotropies of rhenium and hcp iron at high pressure from lattice - strain measurements differ substantially from our theoretical predictions , previous theoretical calculations , the behavior of all other hcp transition metals , and the simple cnnf model ( fig .  [ aniso ] ) .",
    "the shear anisotropy in particular is very different in the high pressure experiments as compared with all other relevant results .",
    "we suggest that this discrepancy may arise from assumptions made in the data analysis .",
    "in particular , the assumption that the state of stress on all crystallographic planes is identical@xcite . this condition may not be satisfied in a material undergoing anisotropic deformation ( e.  g.  dominated by basal slip ) , behavior that is observed for many hcp transition metals .",
    "theory shows much better agreement with lattice - strain experiments in terms of the isotropically averaged moduli .",
    "even so , the agreement in the case of rhenium is much better than for iron . in this context",
    "it is important to point out that part of the discrepancy in the case of iron is due to the mutual inconsistency of the experimentally reported elastic constants and isotropic moduli .",
    "we have found that the elastic constants reported in ref .",
