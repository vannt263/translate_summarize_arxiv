    "from time to time people get excited about the question as to whether the classic one - loop triangle abj anomaly @xcite obtains higher - order loop corrections . if so , what are the consequences of this modified anomaly for the @xmath0 decay mode which is stated to one - loop order in form of a local action term @xcite @xmath1 it is almost thirty years ago that lester l. deraad , kim milton , and wu - yang tsai @xcite challenged the prevalent view that the abj triangle anomaly is an exact statement . that no further corrections are expected is claimed by the so - called adler - bardeen theorem @xcite .",
    "adler and bardeen considered ultraviolet regularization and showed that three - particle exchange processes are not divergent and therefore do not contribute to the anomaly .",
    "but there is also the two - particle intermediate state with the pseudoscalar form factor to be taken into account .",
    "this contribution can not be regularized in a chiral invariant way and so allows for a certain freedom in choosing a normalization point .",
    "hence the occurrence of an anomaly correction depends crucially on the way the infrared regularization is performed .",
    "the anomaly as a short - distance or high - energy phenomenon with cutoff @xmath2 has to be supplemented with the lower end of the momentum scale , @xmath3 .",
    "source theoretical calculations show explicitly that it is indeed not sufficient to merely consider an ultraviolet regularization but an infrared regularization as well .",
    "incidentally , this fact was known a long time ago to the late j. schwinger who showed in the last chapter of his monograph , ref .",
    "@xcite , how the equivalence theorem on the next dynamical level becomes modified by the replacement @xmath4 in the original one - loop triangle diagram .",
    "more recently corrections to the one - loop chiral anomaly were also discussed by v.i .",
    "zakharov @xcite and by the authors in ref .",
    "the greatest impetus on the matter came , however , from a new approach via the so - called average - effective action which m. reuter published in ref .",
    "although we do not have the time to enter this subject , the reader is invited to consult that paper ( especially the appendix ) for further details .",
    "in his seminal work , schwinger @xcite proved the `` equivalence theorem '' which states that in the low - energy regime , a pseudoscalar interaction between a spinless neutral meson and a fermion leads to the same result for the meson decay into two photons as a pseudovector interaction .",
    "for the pseudoscalar interaction between a neutral meson field @xmath5 and a fermion field @xmath6 , the lagrangian is simply given by @xmath7 .",

    "the emphasis is still on electrodynamics .",
    "the only explicit assumption of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 particles enters through the restriction @xmath8 .    in order to describe the decay of the pion into two photons , we replace the fermion fields by their vacuum expectation value in the presence of an external electromagnetic field :    @xmath9 \\rangle^a \\nonumber\\\\ & = & g\\ , \\phi(x)\\ , { \\text{tr}}\\ , \\gamma_5 g(x , x|a ) .",

    "therefore , the electromagnetic fields associated with the photons vary slowly compared to the length scale set by the compton wavelength of the proton . as a consequence",
    ", the constant - field approximation for the proper - time transition amplitude appears to be appropriate in the present situation .    so assuming that a heavy fermion ( proton ) runs in the loop we simply proceed with the constant - field / low - photon - energy approximation . for this limiting situation",
    "( [ 5 ] ) yields @xmath17 this is the famous formula ( 5.25 ) in schwinger s paper @xcite of 1951 .",
    "note that although we included the coupling of the loop - fermion to all orders to the external field , the final result ( [ 6 ] ) is only of second order in the electromagnetic field strength .",
    "hence , if we had expanded the loop perturbatively in @xmath18 , then only the graph with two external photons would have contributed to the final result .",
    "note also that we did not encounter any singular terms while calculating @xmath19 ; the dangerous terms vanished by dirac @xmath20-algebraic arguments .",

    "\\label{10}\\ ] ] now we could follow schwinger and evaluate the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) in the weak - field limit , i.e. , up to second order in the field strength .",
    "this would again correspond to the triangle graph , which is known to contribute solely to the axial - vector anomaly to any finite order of perturbation theory .",
    "instead , we will try to maintain the coupling to the external field to all orders in order to pursue the question of possible non - perturbative contributions to the meson - photon interaction .",
    "of course , the price we have to pay is that we are strictly tied to the slowly varying ( constant ) field approximation .",
    "so , let us employ the representation of the fermionic green s function in an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field : @xmath27_{\\mu\\nu } ( x\\!-\\!x')^\\nu \\right ]    \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\quad\\times \\exp\\left[-{\\text{i}}m^2 s -l(s ) + \\frac{{\\text{i}}}{4 }    ( x\\!-\\!x')\\mathsf{f}(s)(x\\!-\\!x')\\right]\\ , \\exp\\left({\\text{i}}\\frac{e}{2 }    \\sigma fs\\right)\\ ! ,    \\label{11 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28    \\label{14 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] completely carries the gauge dependence of the propagator .",
    "having separated the gauge dependence in this way , we may also write @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the green s function evaluated in the schwinger  fock gauge and depends only on the field strength : @xmath31 .    substituting all these results back into the starting point , i.e. , into the effective lagrangian in eq .",

    "\\right\\}\\!.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing this with our result for the pseudoscalar interaction in ( [ 6 ] ) , it is obvious that an equivalence exists between the two different interactions on the quantum level if the limiting expression in ( [ 16 ] ) finally reduces to 1 for any kind of constant electromagnetic field . by construction",
    ", the proper - time integration has to be performed before the limit @xmath33 can be taken .",
    "e.g. , if we interchanged these processes in ( [ 16 ] ) , then we would find a zero result , since @xmath34 .",
    "to further study the integral in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) we give an explicit expression of the function @xmath35 : @xmath36 for small values of @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 and since the weak - field expansion of @xmath35 coincides with the small-@xmath37 expansion it is here that we can make contact with schwinger s original calculation and so produce an effective lagrangian of a pseudovector interaction between a spinless meson and a heavy fermion field in the presence of a slowly varying _ and _ weak external electromagnetic field : @xmath39 this is identical to the outcome for the pseudoscalar interaction and constitutes the essence of schwinger s equivalence theorem for the low - energy regime . in this sense",
    ", the terminology `` low energy '' refers to the energy of the outgoing photons ( variation of the field strength ) as well as the strength of the field .",
    "now we could go one step further and prove the validity of the equivalence theorem without the weak - field assumption .",
    "details of the proof can be found in our monograph @xcite .",
    "our result is that eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) holds for arbitrary electromagnetic field strengths as long as the fields vary slowly compared to the compton wavelength of the fermionic loop particle .",
    "it has often been emphasized in the original literature @xcite that the discovery of the abj axial - vector anomaly has its roots in schwinger s work . the abj anomaly states that the axial - vector current is not conserved , not only because of an explicit breaking of the axial symmetry by a mass term , but also due to the appearance of the @xmath40 term induced by quantum vacuum effects .",
    "the celebrated result reads : @xmath41 employing the equivalence theorem , we can prove eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , but only for constant external fields .",
    "hence schwinger s work on the constant - field case is only capable of deriving the anomaly in a certain energy regime , namely , the low - energy domain . within the usual diagrammatic approach , adler @xcite and zumino @xcite",
    "arrive at eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , but this time without assuming that the electromagnetic field has to be constant .",
    "this restriction has also been given up in the source approach for the one - loop anomaly as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us conclude this chapter with an interesting observation for the constant - field case . inserting the expression for @xmath42 for constant fields , @xmath43 into eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , we find that the divergence of the axial - vector current vanishes : @xmath44 .",
    "this result appears to be a bit unfamiliar , because it signals the conservation of the axial - vector current at the quantum level , although this current is not conserved at the classical level due to the breaking of the axial symmetry by the mass term .",
    "therefore , the constant - field case is an exceptional situation which creates an `` inverse anomaly '' : a classically and explicitly broken symmetry is restored by quantum effects .",
    "our considerations so far are strictly at the one - loop level .",
    "similarly to the fujikawa @xcite or any other method , photonic fluctuations have not been taken into account .",
    "this will be done in the next chapter , in which we want to challenge the correctness of the adler - bardeen theorem @xcite .",
    "let us begin by looking again at the lowest - order triangle process .",

    "the goal is to compute the vacuum persistence amplitude @xmath52 as for feynman diagrams there are also standard techniques for computing causal diagrams .",

    "in the situation under consideration @xmath58 , so that with @xmath59 the correction is about @xmath60 .",
    "hence for @xmath61 or @xmath57 we again obtain the low - energy result corresponding to a local effective - action term for the pion - photon coupling : @xmath62 which is schwinger s result from 1951 ( with slowly varying fields ) and is the anomaly .",
    "had we treated instead of the pseudoscalar coupling the pseudovector coupling , i.e. , @xmath63 , our calculation would have again resulted in expression ( [ 27 ] )  in accordance with the equivalence theorem .    in eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) we met the expression @xmath64 we also found that for the lowest - order result @xmath65 , and this is intimately related to the anomaly equation .",

    "now , since the two - particle exchange contribution ( with the form factor @xmath66 and massive photon ) can not be regularized in a chiral invariant way , it would appear that an arbitrary normalization point for @xmath86 is allowed .",

    "however , if @xmath98 , one can obtain finite @xmath72 s , e.g. , @xmath99 , which produces no correction .",
    "but then we would have to normalize the pseudoscalar form factor at an infrared sensitive point .",

    "( [ 27 ] ) : @xmath101 we have seen that there exist two mass scales in the theory , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , the two ends of a momentum flow .",
