    "spheroidal stellar populations , such as elliptical galaxies and the halos and bulges of spiral galaxies , contain a significant fraction of all stars in the local universe .",
    "the ages and metallicities of halo stars in these galaxies provide some of the most important observational clues to the formation and earliest evolution of galaxies , whether through studies of globular star clusters ( gcs ) or , in more nearby galaxies , the individual halo stars .",
    "below , we broadly summarize what is currently known about the ages and metallicities of stars in the spheroids of nearby galaxies .",
    "the spheroid of the milky way has two components , a centrally concentrated bulge composed of more metal - rich stars , and an extended , lower density halo consisting of more metal - poor stars .",
    "the halo of the galaxy shows substructure , with ( at least ) two chemically distinct components .",
    "stars of the ` inner halo ' have a mean [ fe / h]@xmath2 @xcite , while stars in the ` outer halo ' ( r@xmath315 kpc ) are more metal - poor , with a mean [ fe / h]@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "the globular clusters in the galaxy have a weak metallicity gradient inside @xmath510 kpc , with no such trend apparent beyond 10  kpc out to the most distant cluster located at @xmath6120 kpc @xcite .",
    "the stars and gcs in the halo of the milky way appear to be mostly old , with ages between 11 and 13  gyr @xcite , indicating that the dominant era of accretion in the milky way took place soon after formation @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the stars in m31 suggest that this galaxy has had a more active , recent accretion history when compared with the milky way .",
    "m31 has a markedly metal - rich inner spheroid component @xcite that is dominated by substructure @xcite .",
    "m31 accreted a relatively massive satellite galaxy only @xmath7  gyr ago @xcite , and has had other many more minor interactions @xcite as well .",
    "deep images taken with the _ hst _ , which reach below the main sequence turnoff region for ancient stars in m31 , indicate the presence of metal - rich , intermediate age stars ( @xmath8  gyr ) in fields located at deprojected distances of 11 , 20 , and 35 kpc , with a larger contribution from older , more metal - poor stars increasing at larger distances @xcite .    beyond @xmath9  kpc and extending out to at least @xmath10  kpc ,",
    "the halo of m31 is dominated by metal - poor stars with [ fe / h]@xmath11 @xcite , and this component too has copious substructure @xcite .",
    "little is known about the ages of these stars except for the recent work of @xcite who studied the m31 gc mgc1 , which is located at a projected galactocentric distance of @xmath12120 kpc .",
    "the cmd of this cluster reveals a metal abundance of [ m / h]@xmath122.3 and a horizontal branch morphology that is consistent with those of milky way gcs at this metal abundance , suggesting a similar age .",
    "studies of stars in the spheroids of several more distant elliptical galaxies suggest that metal - rich stars dominate out quite far , probably to at least 10 - 15@xmath13 .",
    "ngc  5128 has a largely metal - rich population at radii of 8 - 33  kpc @xcite .",
    "even further out , an analysis of the colors of rgb stars , which are sensitive to metallicity , and the colors and luminosities of the agb bump and the rc , which are sensitive to both metallicity and age , suggests that stars in ngc  5128 at @xmath14  kpc have largely intermediate to old ages , with @xmath15  gyr @xcite .",
    "the halos of ngc  3377 and ngc  3379 have a wide range of metallicity , with a significant fraction of metal - rich stars , although metal - poor stars begin to dominate the spheroid of ngc  3379 beyond @xmath16 .",
    "the lack of stars brighter than the rgb suggests that ngc  3377 and ngc  3379 contain few young , bright agb stars @xcite . like ngc  3379 , a dominant population of metal - poor stars have been found in the spheroid of the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  891 @xcite .",
    "m81 is an earlier - type spiral ( sab ) than either the milky way or m31 .",
    "however , studies of the resolved stars in the outskirts of m81 have already shown that it too is a complex mix of stellar populations . @xcite",
    "used 9 archival wfpc2 images of m81 to show that the number density of rgb and agb stars decreases with galactocentric radius , eventually flattening out at a ( deprojected distance ) of @xmath17  kpc .",
    "they attribute the stars interior to this as part of the thick disk , and stars beyond this as part of the halo .",
    "cmds of fields interior to 25  kpc reveal relatively young stars @xcite , and older rgb stars with a relatively large range in metallicity ( @xmath18 < 0 $ ] ; mouhcine  2005 , williams  2009 ) .",
    "these stars are likely located in the disk , either thin or thick , of m81 .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a flattending of the stellar density profile beyond @xmath19  kpc ( deprojected ) from m81 , with more metal - poor stars ( [ m / h]@xmath20 ) than in the interior fields , again indicating that the halo dominates at these distances .",
    "the only constraint on the _ ages _ of stars in the halo of m81 comes from the measurement of absorption line strengths in globular clusters , which suggest ages that are indistinguishable from the gcs in the galaxy , within the significant uncertainties ( @xmath21  gyr ) @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the metallicities and ages of stars in a field in m81 that lies at a projected distance of 19  kpc , using observations taken with the advanced camera for surveys on @xmath0 .",
    "these data are among the deepest available for a portion of m81 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section  2 presents the data and reduction ; section  3 presents the cmd for our field and discusses general features ; section  4 presents a new determination of the distance to m81 from the tip of the rgb , and averages this with previous distance determinations to give our adopted value ; section 5 discusses the red clump , and section  6 presents an estimate of the metallicities and ages of stars in our m81 field . section  7 presents some new results on a small population of blue stars discovered in our field , and section  8 discusses the results in terms of the formation of m81 , as well as our main conclusions .",
    "observations of m81 were obtained with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on - board the @xmath0 , for program go-10604 ( pi : sarajedini ) . a single acs / wfc pointing covering @xmath22",
    "was centered at @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( j2000.0 ) , at a projected distance of 18  from the center of m81 , or 19 kpc at the adopted distance of 3.7  mpc ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the specific pointing was chosen to lie along the southwestern semi - minor axis , beyond the radius suggested as the edge of m81 s thick disk @xcite , where the surface brightness of m81 is still high enough that we can determine a meaningful metallicity distribution from rgb stars .",
    "figure  1a shows the location of our acs pointing .",
    "it also shows the wfpc2 field studied by @xcite , which falls on the edge of the suggested thick disk in m81 , at a projected distance of 12.8  ( 14 kpc ) from the center of m81 .",
    "figure  1b shows our pointing superposed on hi contours from @xcite ; while our field is outside of m81 s purported thick disk ( at a deprojected distance of 30 - 34 kpc ) , it still lies along the line - of - sight with some of the many hi filaments that exist outside m81 s optical disk @xcite .",
    "while some of this hi has been tidally stripped from m81 by encounters with m82 and ngc  3077 , probably @xmath25  myr ago @xcite , velocities of the hi towards our field are consistent with rotation of the m81 disk ( m.yun , private communication ) .",
    "our field was observed on 2005 sept .",
    "11 - 13 for 5 orbits ( 2 images per orbit ) in the f606w filter and 9 orbits ( 2 images per orbit ) in the f814w filter , using a standard 4-point dither pattern .",
    "each individual exposure had an exposure time of 1247s , leading to a total exposure time of 12470s in the f606w filter , and 22446s in the f814w filter .",
    "we retrieved the pipeline flatfielded images from the @xmath0 archive as well as the pipeline - processed multidrizzled combined images from subsets of the data .",
    "photometry was performed with the acs module of the dolphot software package @xcite , which is specifically designed for point - source photometry of objects in the individual flt images , which were taken directly from the @xmath0 archive .",
    "object detection and photometry was performed on all exposures simultaneously , using one of our deep @xmath26 drizzled images ( derived from a subset of 8 images ) as the reference frame .",
    "the dolphot parameters were set to the recommended values given in the dolphot user s guide , which includes psf - fitting using pre - derived psfs , as well as the calculation and application of cte correction @xcite and aperture corrections .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were converted to the vegamag @xmath0 photometric system by adopting the revised zeropoints ( for data taken before july 4 , 2006 ) of 26.420 for f606w and 25.536 for f814w , which differ by @xmath27 mag from the values originally published by @xcite .",
    "we refer to magnitudes in this system by their filter name ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , and in cases when we need to convert to the johnson - cousins systems refer to the filters as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we determined the photometric completeness limits and associated errors in our point - source photometry by adding and remeasuring 60,000 artificial stars in the acs images .",
    "the artificial stars have a range of magnitude ( 24 @xmath32 31 ) and color ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the pritchet interpolation function @xcite    @xmath34    was used to fit the binned completeness fractions @xmath35",
    "( @xmath36 number of stars detected / number of stars added ) as a function of magnitude . here",
    ", @xmath37 is a parameter that measures the rate of decline of @xmath38 at @xmath39 , and @xmath39 is defined as the 50% completeness limit . to account for completeness variations in both color and magnitude , we used only the bluest stars ( @xmath40 ) to determine the f814w completeness fraction @xmath41 , and redder stars ( @xmath42 ) to derive @xmath43 . the limiting magnitude ( @xmath44 ; * ? ? ? * ) for each filter is @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we selected point sources in our field as follows .",
    "first , we restricted our sample to objects with a dolphot category consistent with stars ( obtype=1 )",
    ". of the sources that met this criterion , only those that were measured on at least 8 of the 10 individual f606w images , and on at least 15 of the 18 individual f814w images were retained , yielding a list of 13,858 sources over the entire acs field . to remove remaining , slightly resolved objects",
    ", we applied the following cuts : @xmath47 ( from the psf fitting ) , and a crowding parameter crowd @xmath48 mag , where the latter rejected objects whose magnitudes are likely to be affected by neighboring sources .",
    "finally , we kept only those objects with sharpness values within an empirically - derived hyperbolic function : @xmath49 .",
    "all of these criteria were chosen based on visual inspection of sources on the acs images .",
    "the @xmath28@xmath29 versus @xmath29 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the 9081 remaining objects ( representing our ` cleaned ' sample of stellar objects in the m81 field ) is shown in the left panel of figure  2 , with the cmd of all objects _ rejected _ by the chi / sharp / crowd cuts plotted in the right hand panel .",
    "the photometric errors derived from the artificial star experiments , as well as the 50@xmath50 photometric completeness levels , are also plotted in the left - hand panel .",
    "comparison of the two plots shows that the vast majority of rejected objects do not correspond to the sequences visible in the ` clean ' cmd , lending credence to our choice of classification criteria .",
    "we note that some true stellar sources will be removed by our somewhat stringent selection criteria , but since we are most interested in those objects with the best quality photometry , these are acceptable ` losses ' .",
    "the cleaned cmd extends from above the tip of the first ascent red giant branch ( trgb ) to one magnitude below the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "stars on the red giant branch are older than a few gyr .",
    "the hb has a morphology which is predominantly redward of the rr lyrae instability strip , although we can not unambiguously detect an extended blue horizontal branch due to the presence of a small population of blue stars ( @xmath28@xmath510 ) , which will be discussed in section 7 .",
    "in fact , the red hb resembles a red clump ( rc ) most commonly seen in relatively young ( down to @xmath52  gyr ) and/or metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "an analysis of the rgb and rc stars is presented in section 5 .",
    "there is a small but noticeable population of stars above the trgb , likely asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars of intermediate age ( @xmath125 to 10 gyr ) . from the besanon galaxy model of @xcite",
    ", we estimate that there should be @xmath53 ( foreground ) stars from the milky way with @xmath54 and @xmath55@xmath56 in our field of view , so the vast majority of stars in our m81 field in this color and magnitude range belong to m81",
    ". we will explore these populations in more detail in the upcoming sections .",
    "we determine the luminosity function of the rgb stars in our field by defining an ` rgb zone ' and thereby excluding stars far from the rgb sequence .",
    "we use the z=0.0001 and z=0.004 models of @xcite to provide a general guide to the shape of the rgb in both color and luminosity , after first making the models redder and bluer by 0.05 mag to accomodate photometric uncertainties ; see figure 3 .",
    "however , we explicitly include stars brighter than the tip of the rgb , likely to be agb stars , by allowing a larger range of magnitudes than the model predictions .    in figure  4",
    ", we show the @xmath29 luminosity function of the rgb in our field for those objects in the extraction region with @xmath57 , with a bin width of 0.08 , and uncertainties given by @xmath58 .",
    "we do not make a correction for foreground stars , because we found in  3 that these are very sparse in this direction .",
    "the red clump is clearly present at @xmath59 ; we will return to this feature in section 5 .      in order to interpret our cmd",
    "further , we need to know the distance to m81 . here , we determine the distance from the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) in the @xmath31-band , which has proven to be an excellent distance indicator for metal - poor , old stellar populations @xcite . visual inspection of our cmd shows a transition in the number counts at @xmath60 , albeit with a small number of stars . while a small number of stars in the upper part of the rgb ( there are @xmath61 in our cmd ) can lead to a possible systematic bias in the determination of @xmath62 , @xcite have shown that with at least @xmath63 stars in the top magnitude of the rgb ( as is the case for our luminosity function ) , such biases are expected to be small .    to derive a quantitative estimate of the location of the rgb tip ,",
    "we have employed the sobel edge - detection filter @xcite in order to find the strongest discontinuity in the bright part of our lf in figure 4 ( for the relatively small number of stars in the upper rgb , this simple edge - detection method should suffice for our purposes ) .",
    "each object in the lf is modelled as a gaussian distribution with a dispersion equal to the expected photometric error .",
    "we use the dispersion in the mean of the individual dolphot magnitudes as our photometric error . the resulting luminosity function @xmath64 is plotted at the top of figure 5 . to determine the location of the rgb tip",
    ", we applied to this lf the edge - detection algorithm    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the mean photometric error defined from our artificial star experiments @xcite .",
    "the resultant response function is plotted in the bottom of figure 5 , and shows a peak at @xmath67 , where the small formal uncertainty reflects only the width of the sobel function peak .",
    "converting to the @xmath31-band via the synthetic transformations of @xcite ( and using the revised zeropoints , as noted above ) , we find @xmath68 , where we have adopted an uncertainty of 0.03 mag in the transformation from @xmath29 to @xmath31 .",
    "the true uncertainty in @xmath62 is almost certainly larger than that given above , since they do not include any uncertainties in the photometry itself .",
    "the distance to m81 is determined by comparing the measured magnitude for the tip of the rgb found above with the predicted intrinsic magnitude , @xmath69 ( for [ fe / h]@xmath70 ) from @xcite .",
    "this predicted value is very similar to @xmath71 ( random error ) derived by @xcite , and to @xmath72 ( for [ fe / h]@xmath73 ) from @xcite .",
    "a comparison between observed and predicted @xmath74 magnitudes gives an observed distance modulus of @xmath75 for m81 , or an intrinsic value of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 mpc ) , where we have assumed a foreground extinction of @xmath78 ( using @xmath79 ; * ? ? ? * ) and adopted a 0.02 uncertainty in the foreground reddening to m81 .",
    "this is consistent with determinations from independent trgb estimates and other methods , as discussed below .",
    "several different techniques have been used previously to estimate the distance to m81 , leading to distance modulus estimates that differ by approximately 0.1  mag .",
    "the period - luminosity relationship for cepheid variables is a robust way to determine the distance to nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite determined a value of @xmath80 for m81 , based on 30 cepheids discovered in m81 by @xcite , using @xmath0 observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite determined a distance modulus of @xmath81 based on 11 cepheids , in good agreement with the distance determined by ferrarese et al . here , we adopt the mccommas   value as the cepheid based distance to m81",
    ".    estimates of the distance to m81 based on the tip of the rgb method tend to give a range of values .",
    "we found @xmath82 above , and @xcite derived a mean value of @xmath83 , based on fields which are interior to that used here .",
    "however , @xcite derive a much shorter distance modulus of @xmath84 from their detection of the trgb in an m81 disk field , and @xcite derived a value of @xmath85 from deep photometry of an acs field in m81 s disk .    for this work ,",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath86@xmath87@xmath88@xmath89 ( @xmath90 mpc ) to m81 , which is the mean value of the five distance determinations described above ( 4 trgb values and the cepheid value ) .",
    "the quoted error is the dispersion of the input values ( each of the individual distance determinations have similar uncertainties ) .",
    "inspection of figure 2 shows a well - populated horizontal branch , indicating a population of relatively old stars .",
    "while our data do not allow for a clean detection of a blue horizontal branch , the magnitude and color of the red clump ( rc ) allows us to estimate the age and metallicity of the dominant stellar population in our field , as shown in the next section .    to derive the photometric properties of the rc , we use only those stars with colors in the range @xmath91 ; a close - up of this part of the cmd is shown in figure 6 , along with the luminosity function of stars in this color range , where the rc is clearly visible . to derive the mean magnitude of this feature",
    ", we fit the ` background ' lf immediately brighter and fainter than the rc as a linear function , and fit a single gaussian to the lf once the linear background has been subtracted off .",
    "we note that the choice of bin size and the exact background fit have negligible effect on the mean magnitude determined for the rc clump .",
    "the resulting fit ( and 1@xmath92 uncertainties ) yields @xmath93 . the gaussian width of @xmath94 , while consistent with the expected photometric errors from the artificial star experiments , does allow for some intrinsic spread in age and/or metallicity .",
    "given our adopted distance modulus of @xmath86@xmath87@xmath88@xmath95 , the i - band absolute magnitude in this region of m81 is @xmath96 = 0.21 @xmath1 0.10 .",
    "the location of the rc in our dataset is also consistent with the value derived by @xcite for their m81 outer disk field while we get @xmath97 .",
    "the williams  field exhibits a mean age of 2 - 3 gyr and a metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath98 . in our field",
    "( see next section ) we find a mean age of 9 gyr and a [ m / h]@xmath99 .",
    "our m81 field is @xmath100 gyr older and @xmath101 dex more metal - poor than the williams field .",
    "a change of @xmath102 dex makes the red clump 0.15 mag brighter and a change of + 6 gyr makes the red clump 0.17 mag fainter ( based on fig .",
    "8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so they offset each other resulting in a rc absolute magnitude that is essentially unchanged . ] .",
    "we note the presence of a small positive feature at @xmath103 ( adopted error based on the bin size used ) in the lf in figure 6 .",
    "this feature is very likely the faint signal from the rgb bump  mag @xcite .",
    "we do not see strong evidence for an agb bump here because of the relatively low number of stars in our field .",
    "@xcite do see an agb bump , because their field contains many more stars , but do not observe an rgb bump , likely because their significantly larger range of metallicities and ages washes out this feature . ] , the location on the rgb where the hydrogen - burning shell crosses the discontinuity in chemical abundances remaining from the stars convective envelope @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the rgb bump depends on both the metallicity and the age of the stars , and will be used as a consistency check on our results in the next section .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the red clump , as well as the shape ( slope ) and location ( color ) of the rgb are both sensitive to the age and metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "however , the rgb is more sensitive to metallicity than to age , and the magnitude of the rc is more sensitive to age than to metallicity , so it is possible to use both features together to constrain the age and metallicity of the dominant population .",
    "we compare the observations with the theoretical isochrones of @xcite , assuming scaled - solar abundance .",
    "cmd as this makes use of the well - determined photometric zeropoints for the acs / wfc instrument .",
    "however , the theoretical dependence of the red clump magnitude on metallicity and age is performed in the ground - based system as it requires knowledge of the median i - band rc magnitude for a population of stars , and these have only been constructed for the ground - based filters .",
    "this is unlikely to introduce a significant systematic effect because the acs / wfc f814w passband closely matches its ground - based @xmath31-band counterpart .",
    "we also note that the rgbs of the @xcite isochrones are identical to those of @xcite . ]",
    "we first correct the colors and magnitudes using the values for reddening and distance noted above .",
    "next , we assume an age and use the colors of rgb stars with @xmath104@xmath1052.0 to determine metallicity based on an interpolation within the @xcite grid of theoretical isochrones with 2.3@xmath106[m / h]@xmath1060.0 . figure 7 shows these theoretical rgbs overplotted on our m81 cmd for an age of 9 gyr .",
    "the @xmath104@xmath1052.0 magnitude range is chosen to minimize the effect of asymptotic giant branch stars on the blue side of the rgb @xcite .",
    "the resultant mean metallicity and the i - band absolute magnitude of the rc derived above , @xmath96 = 0.21 @xmath1 0.10 , are used in conjunction with the @xcite models for the median magnitude of the red clump stars to infer the age of the population .",
    "this age estimate @xmath107 is then used to redetermine the mean metallicity from the rgb stars and the process is repeated .",
    "this iterative procedure converges quickly and yields a mean metallicity of [ m / h ] @xmath108 ( random ) , @xmath10.11 ( systematic ) , where the latter value includes the influence of errors in the distance modulus and reddening .",
    "the mean age of the dominant population is then @xmath86@xmath107@xmath88 = 9 @xmath1 2 gyr , where the quoted uncertainty reflects the error in the red clump magnitude , which is the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "the resultant metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) is shown in fig .",
    "8 wherein the fitted gaussian profile gives a 1-@xmath92 width of 0.39 dex in [ m / h ] .",
    "the dominant signal in the mdf is due to stars around @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",

    "this suggests a significant fraction of the @xmath112}$ ] exhibited by the mdf is due to an intrinsic range in metallicity among the m81 stars in our field . in particular , subtracting the dispersion due to errors from the measured dispersion in quadrature yields an intrinsic abundance spread of @xmath112}$]= 0.37 dex .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that we have used scaled - solar isochrones for the determination of the mdf shown in fig .",
    "the degree to which field stars in the m81 halo are enhanced in the @xmath37-capture elements is currently not known .",
    "we can estimate the effect of such an enhancement on our mdf using the formalism of @xcite :    @xmath113 = [ fe / h ] + log(0.638f_{\\alpha } + 0.362)\\ ] ]    where @xmath114 represents the factor by which the @xmath37-elements are enhanced .",
    "thus , if @xmath115$]=@xmath116 , then @xmath114=2 and our computed scaled - solar [ m / h ] values are larger than [ fe / h ] by @xmath117 dex .",
    "we conclude this section by providing a series of consistency checks on our principle result , which is that the mean metallicity and age of stars in our m81 field are [ m / h]@xmath118 and @xmath119  gyr , respectively .",
    "first , the location of the weak rgb bump ( described in the previous section ) at @xmath120 can be used to provide an independent estimate of the age / metallicity of the m81 field stars .",
    "indeed , the rgb bump lies above the hb / rc for primarily old , more metal - poor populations @xcite . from our adopted distance modulus , an assumed mean color @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", we find @xmath123 . from the relations in @xcite ( and adopting an additional 0.1 dex uncertainty in those relations ) , this translates to a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath124 for an old , 12 gyr population , or a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath125 for a 9 gyr population . while the uncertainties in these results are large , and the @xmath37 enhancement unknown , the age and metallicity derived from the rgb bump are broadly consistent with what we find from the location of the rc .",

    ", we compare our cmd with that for the galactic globular cluster ngc  362 , studied as part of the @xmath0 treasury project go-10775 @xcite .",
    "this cluster has a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath128 ( on the @xcite scale ) , and an age of @xmath1210.5 gyr @xcite , and therefore provides a good reference for our field .",
    "figure 9 shows our m81 photometry compared with the ngc 362 fiducial sequence derived from the hst treasury project data .",
    "the latter has been shifted by @xmath129=13.12 and @xmath130=0.05 .",
    "these are based on adopted values of @xmath131 and @xmath132 for ngc 362 @xcite and @xmath133 and @xmath134 for m81 .",

    "the color distribution of m81 rgb stars is slightly bluer than the ngc 362 rgb fiducial , and is most evident within one magnitude of the m81 rgb tip .",
    "this could be due to ngc 362 being slightly more metal - rich ( @xmath120.05 dex ) and somewhat older ( 1 to 2 gyr ) than the mean properties of the m81 field . taken together , these could account for a color difference of @xmath120.03 mag in @xmath135 on the rgb .",
    "our cmd of the m81 halo field shows a ( small ) population of blue stars with @xmath136 , properties expected for young ( @xmath137  yr ) stars , but not for the stars in the halo of a spiral galaxy .",
    "we have checked that these are genuine sources with blue colors .",
    "they are clearly point - like and not obvious background galaxies , and are scattered throughout our acs field .",
    "we conclude that these are likely individual , young stars associated with m81 .",
    "furthermore , the rather sudden appearance of these objects at @xmath138 blueward of the dominant rgb suggests that these are not rgb or rc stars in m81 scattered due to large photometric errors .",
    "an overlay of metal - rich ( z=0.008 ; [ m / h]@xmath139 ) isochrones from @xcite onto our cmd is shown in fig .",
    "10 , and suggests that these blue stars have ages between @xmath140-@xmath141  myr .",
    "what is the origin of these stars ?",
    "they have colors and magnitudes similar to a stellar population seen in the cmd of an outer disk field in m81 ( figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "potentially then , there is a sparse outer disk in m81 , which contributes a very small fraction of the stars observed in our field .",
    "if these stars are an extension of the true outer disk of m81 , then the disk plane extends out @xmath634 - 40 kpc from m81 .",
    "a second possibility is that these stars formed in the disk of m81 or in one if its companions , and then were carried to this location along with the hi tidal debris that is coincident with our field , likely as a result of the most recent galactic interactions between m81 , m82 and ngc 3077 , which occurred @xmath142 myr ago ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also weisz   2008 ) .",
    "the observed hi gas along the line - of - sight to our acs field has a column density of only @xmath143@xmath144 @xcite .",
    "recent ( @xmath145 myr ) star formation has been found not only in the outskirts of m81 itself @xcite but also in nearby tidal dwarf galaxies such as holmberg ix @xcite , bk3n @xcite , and in other nearby tidal debris @xcite .",
    "however , in all of these cases , the recent star formation has occurred in areas with higher hi column densities ( @xmath146@xmath144 ) than that observed in our field , and is thus consistent with the lack of _ recent _ ( i.e. @xmath147  yr ) star formation in our field .",
    "this is also consistent with the findings of @xcite , who find recent low - level star formation at levels @xmath148@xmath144 ) .",
    "we note that while recent episodes of star formation in the outermost regions of late types galaxies have been observed at column densities similar to that in our field ( @xmath149@xmath144 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we do not see evidence of this in our ( small ) field .",
    "we conclude that while we do see evidence for blue stars in our field , these make only a small contribution to the stellar population in our m81 field .",
    "the main result from our analysis of a field at a ( projected ) distance of @xmath150 ( 19 kpc ) from the center of m81 , just beyond the suggested edge of the thick disk , is that the dominant population has a mean age of 9@xmath12 gyr and a peak metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath151 0.11 .",
    "below , we discuss these results in the context of the formation history of m81 , and compare with results from the spheroids of other nearby galaxies .",
    "the color distribution of stars on the rgb in our m81 field is relatively blue and rather narrow .",
    "we derived the metallicity distribution of these rgb stars by comparing with theoretical isochrones , and find a mean [ m / h ] of 1.15 , with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.37 dex as shown in figure  8 .",
    "our field is dominated by stars that are more metal - poor than stars located closer to the center of m81 ; indeed , our acs field contained the most metal - poor stars in any m81 field observed thus far . in figure  11 , we compare our mdf ( for an assumed age of 9 gyr ) with that determined by @xcite ( for globular cluster - like ages ; @xmath152  gyr for a field that is also along the southwest minor axis , but somewhat closer to the center of m81 with a projected distance of @xmath1214  kpc ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "while the general shape for the mdf is similar in both fields , the mouhcine  field is clearly dominated by stars which are more metal - rich by @xmath153  dex than the stars studied here ( where we have already accounted for the differences in the assumed ages of the mdfs  adopting a slightly older ( by @xmath154  gyr ) age would effectively _ decrease _ the mean metallicity of our mdf by @xmath155  dex ; making the difference between the mdfs larger ) .",
    "this metallicity difference is not likely to be due to uncertainties in the colors or in the adopted reddening values ; to match a 0.4 dex difference in [ m / h ] , our mean rgb would need to be redder by @xmath155 in ( @xmath156 . similarly , the mdfs of @xcite are more metal - poor than the outer ( thick ? ) disk field presented by @xcite , a field dominated by relatively old ( 2/3 of stars formed more than @xmath12 8 gyr ago ) but relatively metal - rich stars .",
    "this sequence of declining metallicity with location indicates that either there is a strong metallicity gradient in the disk of m81 , or that our field ( as well as the mouhcine  field ) samples a different structural component of m81 than @xcite .",
    "the markedly lower metallicity between our field and that of the outer disk of m81 , combined with the relatively old ages inferred for these stars ( discussed below ) and the lack of ( much ) recent star formation , provide tentative evidence that our field is largely dominated by stars in the _ halo _ of m81 , rather than in a thick disk .    in a recent wide - field study of bright stars in m81 s outer regions @xcite suggest the presence of a faint , structurally distinct component surrounding m81 with a mean metallicity [ m / h]@xmath157 ;",
    "the large uncertainty is due to the rather limited part of the rgb observable in their ground - based data .",
    "this metallicity is slightly higher than ( but consistent with ) the value found here .",
    "dex ] our field is not located within the region surveyed by @xcite , but lies at a deprojected distance of 34 - 40  kpc from m81 , comparable to the distance of the fields used for their metallicity estimate .",
    "this extended component has properties similar ( but not identical ) to either the milky way thick disk or the halo , making the exact nature of this structure somewhat uncertain .",
    "future deep observations of m81 s outer regions will be needed to help establish the true nature of this feature .",
    "we can compare the mdf that we derive for our 20  kpc field in m81 with the metallicities found for the spheroids / halos of other nearby galaxies . at galactocentric radii of @xmath158 kpc ,",
    "similar to the location of our m81 pointing , the spheroid of m31 is dominated by a largely metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath159 ) population @xcite .",
    "the stars in the halo of the milky way are metal - poor , with typical [ fe / h ] values of @xmath160 to @xmath161 for the inner halo ( out to @xmath162  kpc ) @xcite and @xmath163 beyond this ( * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "the halo of the e / s0 galaxy ngc 3379 ( at a galactocentric distance of 33 kpc ) shows a broad metallicity distribution with a significant number of metal - poor ( [ m / h]@xmath164 ) stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the large elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 has a metal - rich halo with [ m / h]@xmath165 to @xmath166 at _ all _ locations studied thus far , from 8 - 38 kpc @xcite .",
    "similarly , the elliptical galaxy ngc 3377 also shows a largely metal - rich population at small galactocentric radii @xcite .    taken together , large , nearby galaxies exhibit a wide diversity of halo metallicities , showing no clear trends with parent galaxy mass or morphological type ( although there are suggestions that halo metallicity increases with galaxy mass , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indeed , it appears that variations in the metallicity of halo stars _ even at different locations within a given ` halo ' _ could make any trends with parent galaxy properties difficult to quantify .",
    "for example , the metallicity of stars in our single m81 field are similar to that of the ` halo ' of ngc 3379 , the ` outer halo ' of m31 , and the ` inner halo ' of the milky way ( assuming @xmath115\\sim + 0.3 - 0.4 $ ] ) .",
    "if we have indeed sampled the halo of m81 , an open question is whether an even more metal - poor population exists at larger galactocentric radii ; again , future studies of more distant m81 field would be worthwhile .",
    "while our cmd does not reach the main sequence turnoff region , the most reliable age - sensitive feature in the cmd , it still holds clues to the dominant age of the stars in this region of m81 .",
    "formal fits to the rc , rgb , and rgb bump give consistent estimates for the mean age of the stars of @xmath167  gyr .",
    "the fact that we do not observe a strong population of blue horizontal branch stars is also consistent with these results .",
    "we can compare the ages estimated for stars in the spheroids of different galaxies , although it should be noted that these estimates come from different techniques .",
    "the dominant population of our m81 field is slightly younger but consistent with the mean ages ( 9.7 , 11.0 , and 10.5 gyr , for fields at distances of 11 , 21 , and 35 kpc from m31 ) of the m31 halo fields studied by ( * ? ? ? * and references within ) .",
    "the halo of m31 also harbors globular clusters as old as those in the milky way @xcite ; however , the presence or absence of any radial age trends among this population is still largely an open question .",
    "in contrast , the stars in our m81 field appear to be slightly younger ( by @xmath168  gyr , but just within the age uncertainties ) , than the oldest stars in the milky way halo @xcite , as our comparison with the globular cluster ngc 362 illustrated above . while there is an age spread of a few gyr among the milky way gcs with the inner halo clusters being older in the mean than those of the outer halo @xcite , the ages of globular clusters in m81 ( estimated from integrated spectra ) are indistinguishable from galactic globular clusters ( within the sizeable uncertainties * ? ? ? * ) . it should be noted that these clusters are all projected at smaller distances in m81 than the location of our field .",
    "we note that our data do _ not _ rule out the presence of a minority population of older stars , as ancient as the majority galactic globular cluster system , in this region of m81 .    in the case of ngc 5128",
    ", @xcite investigated the ages of field stars at a distance of 38  kpc using the magnitude of the rc , and found that it is consistent with an old population with a mean age of @xmath169 gyr , very similar to the ages that we observe in the m81 halo .",
    "our age and metallicity results for halo stars in m81 are in broad agreement with predictions from some @xmath170cdm models @xcite , where the outer ( @xmath171 kpc ) halos of @xmath172 galaxies are expected to be formed from the accreted ( over a relatively long timescale ) debris of somewhat lower - mass progenitor galaxies than the more metal - rich systems that ( for instance ) resulted in the formation of the more metal - rich giant southern stream in m31 @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the outer halos of luminous galaxies like m81 will have more metal - poor and somewhat younger combined stellar populations than that of the ( slightly ) older , more metal - rich inner halo / spheroid .",
    "our results are broadly consistent with these predictions .",
    "we have presented deep photometry of a field located 20 kpc from the center of m81 , believed to be dominated by halo stars .",
    "the resulting cmd , based on hst / acs imaging , reveals a relatively blue rgb and a hb populated predominantly redward of the instability strip ( i.e. , a red clump ) . from the shape of the rgb ,",
    "the magnitude of the red clump , and the location of the rgb bump , we derive a mean metallicity of [ m / h ] = 1.15 @xmath1 0.11 and an age of 9 @xmath1 2 gyr for the dominant population in this region of m81 s halo .",
    "this is the lowest metallicity found for stars in any portion of m81 , almost certainly because our field is more distant than any other portion of m81 studied to date .",
    "our age and metallicity results are broadly consistent with the predictions from @xmath170cdm models , which predict lower metallicities and younger mean ages for outer halos of spiral galaxies than for inner halos .",
    "future studies that probe the metallicities and ages of stars even further out in the halo of m81 will allow for better constraints on the early formation of this galaxy .    a.s . and p.r.d . were supported through funds provided by nasa through grants ( go-10604.01-a and go-10604.02.a , respectively ) from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",

    "<S> we present a deep color - magnitude diagram for individual stars in the halo of the nearby spiral galaxy m81 , at a projected distance of 19  kpc , based on data taken with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cmd reveals a red giant branch that is narrow and fairly blue , and a horizontal branch that has stars that lie mostly redward of the rr lyrae instability strip . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a mean metallicity of [ m / h ] = 1.15 @xmath1 0.11 and age of 9 @xmath1 2 gyr for the dominant population in our field , from the shape of the red giant branch , the magnitude of the red clump , and the location of the red giant branch bump . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our metallicity and age results with those found previously for stars in different locations within m81 , and in the spheroids of other nearby galaxies . </S>"
