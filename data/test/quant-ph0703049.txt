    "motivated by the fact that all realistic quantum systems are coupled to their surrounding environments , many researchers have paid their attention on the study of geometric phase in open systems since 1980s@xcite . from the perspective of application , the use of geometric phase in the implementation of fault - tolerant quantum gates @xcite also requires the study of geometric phase in open systems , because the system which needs to be manipulated may decoher from a quantum superposition into statistical mixtures due to coupling to its environment . despite of extensive studies that have been performed in this direction , investigation into the effect of correlation among the environmental systems on the induced geometric phase in open systems",
    "is lacking .",
    "geometric phases have been shown to associate with a variety of condensed matter phenomena @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their connection to quantum phase transitions has only been given recently in @xcite , where it has been shown that the berry s phase can be used to signal the critical points of the spin chain@xcite , the critical exponents were evaluated from the scaling behavior of geometric phases@xcite , and the geometric phase can be considered as a topological test to reveal quantum phase transitions@xcite . in these works , the geometric phase analyzed is acquired by the ground state ( or the low lying excited states ) of the many - body system .",
    "this gives rise to the following question , whether the geometric phase induced in an auxiliary system by the many - body system has connection to the critical points of the many - body system . in this paper",
    ", we shall try to answer this question by examining the geometric phase induced in a qubit by the many - body system .",
    "this makes our study different from that in @xcite .",
    "two kinds of coupling between the auxiliary qubit and the many - body system are considered .",
    "the first kind of coupling commutes with the free hamiltonian of the auxiliary qubit , leading to dephasing in the qubit . whereas the second one commutes with the free hamiltonian of the many - body system , which causes energy loss ( dissipation ) of the qubit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present a general formulism to calculate and analyze the reduced density matrix of the auxiliary qubit , and establish a connection of the reduced density matrix to the critical points . as an example",
    ", we calculate the geometric phase induced in the auxiliary qubit taking the xy spin chain as the many - body system in sec.iii . and",
    "finally we conclude our results in sec.iv .",
    "in this section , we will give a general formalism to analyze the reduced density matrix of a qubit coupled to a quantum many - body system , and establish a connection between the reduced density matrix of the qubit and the criticality in the quantum system .",
    "we restrict ourself to consider the following qubit to many - body system couplings .",
    "first we consider the case where the coupling conserves the energy of the qubit",
    ". then we analyze the case where the energy of the qubit does not conserve , but the energy of the quantum many - body system conserves .",
    "the first case corresponds to dephasing in the qubit , while the second kind of coupling results in dissipation in the qubit .",
    "consider a qubit coupled to a quantum many - body system .",
    "the hamiltonian that governs the evolution of the whole system may have the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the free hamiltonian of the qubit , @xmath2 stands for the free hamiltonian of the quantum many - body system , and @xmath3 represents the coupling between them .",
    "@xmath4 is an arbitrary operator of the many - body system .",
    "it is clear that @xmath5=0 $ ] , therefore the energy of the qubit conserves .",
    "the quantum system described by @xmath2 undergoes a quantum phase transition for parameter @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to show that the time evolution operator for the whole system may be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are eigenstates of @xmath14 for the qubit . having these expressions ,",
    "we now show that the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the qubit change drastically in the vicinity of critical points . to this end , we assume that the qubit and the quantum many - body system are initially independent , such that we take the following product state as the initial state of the whole system @xmath15 where @xmath16 represent the ground state of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . by a standard calculation ,",
    "one obtains the reduced density matrix of the qubit @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 this is the survival probability of the ground state of the quantum system under the action of the hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "the leading term @xmath23 of this equation represents the overlap function between two ground states @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath25 denotes the ground state of @xmath22 .",
    "this overlapping function was shown @xcite to take extremal values in the vicinity of critical points .",
    "in fact , @xmath20 represents the loschmidt echo which goes exponentially to zero as the many - body system approaches the regions of criticality@xcite .",
    "this give us the behavior of @xmath20 in the vicinity of critical points @xmath26 as @xmath27 , leading to a dramatic change in the induced geometric phase near this point @xmath26 .",
    "we would like to notice that the above discussions hold for a general coupling between the spin and the quantum system , provided the coupling is weak .",
    "next we turn to study the case when the energy of the qubit does not conserve , but the energy of the many - body system conserves instead .",
    "this implies that @xmath28\\neq 0,$ ] but @xmath29=0.$ ] without loss of generality , we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath30 @xmath31 are pauli operators of the qubit .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath32 can be rewritten as @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 the fact that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath32 commutes with @xmath17 enables us to write the time evolution operator of the whole system as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are eigenstates of @xmath17 with corresponding eigenenergies @xmath38 , and we assume that they are nondegenerate .",

    "having established this linkage , we claim that the final state of the qubit @xmath44 and the geometric phase acquired by this state can signal quantum critical points in the many - body system , provided the initial state of the many - body system is a superposition of @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and at least two @xmath48 including @xmath49 are not zero .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the geometric phase in this case can not signal the critical points , if the many - body system is initially in the ground state with probability 1 .",
    "this is because the qubit - system interaction could not excite the many - body system in this situation . in other words ,",
    "if the couplings between the qubit and the many - body system commute with the free hamiltonian of the many - body system , the many - body system would remain in its initial state if the initial state is one of the eigenvalues of the free hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the many - body system would make no effect on the qubit during the dynamics , and consequently the geometric phase acquired by the qubit could not signal the critical points of the many - body system .",
    "in this section , we will present an example to illustrate the claim . taken a spin - chain described by the one - dimensional xy model as the quantum many - body system",
    ", the hamiltonian for the whole system ( spin+chain ) may be given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes spin operator of the qubit which couples to the chain spins @xmath53 @xmath54 located at the lattice site @xmath55 .",
    "the spins in the chain are coupled to the qubit through a constant @xmath56 .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath57 for the whole system may be written as @xmath58 it is easy to show that @xmath59 satisfy @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "if the auxiliary qubits are initially in state @xmath63 , the dynamics and statistical properties of the spin chain would be govern by @xmath64 , it takes the same form as @xmath17 but with modified field strengths @xmath65 .",

    "the operators @xmath71 parameterized by @xmath78 clearly do not commute with each other , this will leads to nonzero geometric phase in the auxiliary qubits as shown later on . before going on to calculate the reduced density matrix",
    ", we present a discussion on the diagonalization of @xmath64 .",
    "for a chain with periodic boundary condition , i.e. , @xmath79 boundary terms @xmath80[exp(i\\pi m)+1]$ ] have to be taken into acount@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would work with @xmath81 ignored , because we are interested in finding a link between the criticality of the chain and the entanglement in the auxiliary qubits .",
    "in fact , the boundary effect can be ignored provided @xmath82 , this is exactly the situation we consider in this paper .    having given an initial product(separable ) state of the total system , @xmath83",

    ", we now turn to study the geometric phase of the open system . for an open system ,",
    "the state in general is not pure and the evolution of the system is not unitary . for non - unitary evolution as shown in eq.([stateab ] ) , the geometric phase can be calculated as follows .",
    "first , solve the eigenvalue problem for the reduced density matrix @xmath92 and obtain its eigenvalues @xmath93 as well as the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath94 secondly , substitute @xmath93 and @xmath95 into    @xmath96    here , @xmath97 is the geometric phase for the system undergoing non - unitary evolution @xcite , @xmath98 is the total evolution time . the geometric phase eq .",
    "( [ gp5 ] ) is gauge invariant and can be reduced to the well - known results in the unitary evolution .",
    "it is experimentally testable .",
    "the geometric phase factor defined by eq.([gp5 ] ) may be understood as a weighted sum over the phase factors pertaining to the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix , thus the detail of analytical expression for the geometric phase would depend on the digitalization of the reduced density matrix eq.([stateab ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are readily calculated @xmath99 in order to calculate the geometric phase , we only need the eigenvalue @xmath100 and its corresponding eigenvector @xmath101 since @xmath102 here @xmath103 and @xmath104 i.e. , the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part of @xmath105 having these results , we obtain the geometric phase , @xmath106 we would like to notice that the geometric phase vanishes with @xmath107 because @xmath108 at this point .",
    "@xmath108 results in @xmath109 in eq.([gp6 ] ) , this together with that @xmath110 is real yield zero geometric phase at this critical point .",
    "now we turn to study the criticality in the transverse ising model(@xmath111 in the xy model ) .",
    "the ground state structure of this model change drastically as the parameter @xmath112 is varied .",
    "we first summarize the ground states of this model in the limits of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the ground state of the spin - chain approaches a product of spins pointing the positive / negative @xmath116 direction in the @xmath113 limit , whereas the ground state in the limit @xmath115 is doubly degenerate under the global spin flip by @xmath117 . at @xmath114 ,",
    "a fundamental transition in the ground state occurs , the symmetry under the global spin flip breaks at this point and the chain develops a nonzero magnetization @xmath118 which increases with @xmath119 growing . the above mentioned properties of the ground state",

    "the difference between @xmath107 and @xmath111 is that @xmath108 for @xmath107 , but it does not hold for @xmath111 .",
    "this is the reason why the geometric phase takes different values at these critical points , as figure [ fig1 ] shows .",
    "the ground state of the xy model is really complicated with many different regime of behavior@xcite , these are reflected in sharp changes in the geometric phase across the line @xmath114 regardless of @xmath112 ( as shown in figure 1-(a),(b ) and ( c ) ) , indicating the change in the ground state of the spin - chain from paramagnetic phase to the others . instead of discussing the scaling behavior of the induced geometric phase , we consider the scaling property of @xmath126 given in eq.([stateab ] ) in the vicinity of the critical points . noticing that @xmath126 is a function of @xmath127 @xmath128 , the scaling behavior of @xmath126 may be characterized by @xmath129 , and @xmath130@xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the vicinity of criticality for the one - dimensional xy model .",
