    "linear chains of scatterers represent a useful model of macroscopic structures like multi - layered structures , real - life wires , nano - tubes etc .",
    "this is the reason that the scattering chains have attracted a lot of scientific attention from the early 1980s to the present time .",
    "past studies mainly focused on the chain of randomly chosen scatterers and its average properties . for good reviews on this topic",
    "see @xcite , where the main approach of theoretical analysis is the transfer matrix formalism @xcite .",
    "some other interesting articles discussing linear chain of scatterers with some disorder using the same approach are @xcite .",
    "there were also attempts to understand the chains using purely scattering matrix approach , although they have only partially used its advantages .",
    "for original references along these lines see refs .",
    "a considerable breakthrough in understanding of localisation in disordered wires was made using the dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) scaling equation @xcite , which gives the scaling of the distribution of transmission - like - quantities of individual modes with the chain length .",
    "more recently there was some renewed interest in scattering formalism , for example in the stability analysis of scattering matrix merging procedures @xcite , and the random walk in the scattering chains @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the scatterers on the chain can be any conservative open quantum systems generating wave - dynamics , and having two identical waveguides attached on the left / right side which connect to the previous / next scatterer ( see figure [ pic : cell ] ) .",
    "we shall leave out from discussion all geometric parameters of the systems and the wave - guides and work purely algebraically to make results as general as possible .",
    "we are interested in general _ on - shell transport properties _ of these chains in the process of lengthening , namely in what we shall refer to as _ the dynamical approach to scattering_. we work within the scattering matrix formalism in order to avoid divergences present in e.g. transfer matrix formalism , and to take advantage of the compactness of the phase space manifold of scattering matrices .",
    "the presented dynamical approach enables intuitively clear insight into the finite and infinite chains . in the following sections , besides discussing dynamical properties of lengthening",
    ", we also derive some interesting transport properties of the chain in three different cases : translationally invariant chain , chain with weak disorder and chain with strong disorder .",
    "some of our results can be understood as re - derivation of known transport properties of one - dimensional lattices from a simple new dynamical perspective , in particular for the case of single - channel scatterers .",
    "however , in case of multi - channel scatterers we report some new - numerical - results on the scaling of haar measures of scattering matrices corresponding to ballistic and localised dynamics .",
    "in this section we give a short sketch of scattering formalism in quantum chains , but the reader can see @xcite for details . the stationary schr \" odinger equation for the open quantum problem composed of the scatterer and two infinite wave - guides is written symbolically as h = e , where @xmath0 represents the hamiltonian of the system .",

    "in particular we give accurate numerical results on the scaling of haar volumes of the sets of scattering matrices corresponding to totally localised , and ballistic transport .",
