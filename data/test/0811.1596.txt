    "decoherence is a nearly universal effect in quantum systems , and one which plays a central role in the quantum to classical transition .",
    "however , the word `` decoherence '' is often used to denote several related , but distinct concepts .",
    "the first is dephasing , the loss of definite phase relations between different components in a superposition state .",
    "these phase relationships are essential for quantum interference , which can be regarded as the key phenomenon which distinguishes the quantum world from the classical world . in general , interaction of a quantum system with its environment can lead to dephasing .",
    "the second , closely related concept , is that of entanglement between the quantum system and its environment .",
    "entanglement by itself need not lead to decoherence , but often the variables of the environment are too numerous or complex to be readily measured .",
    "it is when one gives up on any attempt to keep track of the environmental degrees of freedom that decohenece arises .",
    "the third concept associated with decoherence is the revelation of `` which path '' information .",
    "any measurement in a double slit interference experiment which reveals the path taken by the particles will destroy the interference pattern .    here",
    "we will consider a specific example of a quantum system , coherent electrons coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field . an electron interference experiment , such as that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] , deals with one of the simplest possible quantum systems , but also one in which many beautiful experiments have been performed in recent years@xcite .",
    "the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field allows for photon emission by the electrons , leading to decoherence .",
    "this example illustrates all three of the versions of decoherence discussed above . as will be shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : ab ] , the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field produces dephasing , or a loss of contrast in the interference pattern as a result of aharonov - bohm phase fluctuations .",
    "the emission of photons leads to entanglement between the quantum state of the electrons and that of the photons . finally , photon emission is capable of revealing `` which path '' information . if the wavelength of an emitted photon is less than the separation of the two electron paths in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] , then detection of that photon reveals the path taken by a given electron . in the cleanest version of the electron interference experiment , the flux of electrons may be made so low that only one electron is in the interferometer at any one time .",
    "consider a double slit interference experiment in which coherent electrons can take either one of two paths , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] .",
    "first consider the case of no field fluctuations .",
    "if the amplitudes for the electrons to take path @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , to point @xmath4 , then the mean number of electrons at @xmath4 will be proportional to @xmath5 in the presence of a classical , non - fluctuating electromagnetic field described by vector potential @xmath6 , there will be an aharonov - bohm phase shift of the form@xcite .",
    "@xmath7 where the integral is taken around the closed path @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath9 is the electron s charge .",
    "we will use lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath10 .",
    "the phase shift alters the locations of the interference minima and maxima , but does not alter their relative amplitudes , the contrast .",
    "if the electromagnetic field undergoes fluctuations , then the situation is different . in the case of gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the fluctuating aharonov - bohm phase causes a change in the contrast by a factor of @xmath11 where we define the _ coherence functional _ by @xmath12 with the angular brackets denoting averaging over the fluctuations .",
    "this functional can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath15 if the initial quantum state of the electromagnetic field is the vacuum , then @xmath16 is the vacuum hadamard function .",
    "note that the hadamard function itself is gauge dependent , but that @xmath17 is gauge invariant .",
    "in general , @xmath18 , leading to a reduction in contrast or dephasing . at the same time , the coherence functional reflects the effects of photon emission . if the electromagnetic field is initially in its vacuum state , @xmath19 , then after an electron traverses path @xmath20 , it will be in the state @xmath21 which is a superposition of photon number eigenstates .",
    "thus the descriptions in terms of a fluctuating aharonov - bohm phase or in terms of photon emission are complementary viewpoints .",
    "various aspects of decoherence associated with fluctuating or time - dependent electromagnetic fields have been discussed by numerous authors in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the connection between aharonov - bohm phase fluctuations and decoherence was discussed in by stern _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "the effects of boundaries , such as a plane mirror , were considered by ford@xcite .",
    "some of these estimates for the magnitude of the effects were criticized by mazzitelli _",
    "@xcite as being too large .",
    "the discrepancy is likely due to the sharp corners in the electron paths used@xcite ; when smooth paths are employed@xcite , the effects are much smaller .",
    "this can be understood because sharp boundaries cause large amounts of photon emission , which can in turn be modified by a perfectly reflecting boundary .",
    "a different effect was discussed by anglin _",
    "et al_@xcite and machnikowski@xcite , who considered the effect of an imperfect conductor . here",
    "the motion of electrons over the conductor can cause excitations inside the metal , resulting in decoherence .",
    "this type of decoherence was recently observed by sonnentag and hasselbach@xcite .",
    "the initial quantum state of the electromagnetic field need not be the vacuum .",
    "the case of a thermal state , and the resulting increased decoherence , was discussed by breuer and petruccione@xcite .",
    "another possibility is a time - dependent classical electromagnetic field@xcite .",
    "here one really has aharonov - bohm phase variations rather than fluctuations .",
    "however in most experiments , one would average over the emission time of the electrons and effectively lose the information carried by this time - dependent phase , leading to decoherence .",
    "now we consider the situation when the initial state of the photon field is not the vacuum , but rather a squeezed state@xcite .",
    "such states have the property that they can temporarily suppress the quantum fluctuations in a given variable below the vacuum level . for example , the local energy density in such a state can be negative , although the total energy is always positive .",
    "the effects of squeezed states of photons on coherent electrons were recently analyzed by us@xcite . in this section , we will give a summary of the results found there .",
    "consider the special case where the quantized electromagnetic field is in a state in which one mode is excited to a squeezed vacuum state , and all other modes remain in the ground state .",
    "we take the excited mode to be a plane wave in a box with periodic boundary conditions , with wave vector @xmath22 and polarization @xmath23 , so the quantum state may be denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "this is a one complex parameter family of states , labeled by @xmath25 .",
    "take the plane wave to be travelling in the @xmath26-direction , with linear polarization in the @xmath27-direction . for electrons emitted at @xmath28",
    ", we take the paths @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be given by @xmath29 ^ 2 \\,.\\ ] ] that is , the electrons start at @xmath30 at @xmath28 , reach their maximum separations where @xmath31 at @xmath32 , and finally return to @xmath30 at @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 can be thought of as the effective flight time and path separation , respectively .",
    "electrons which start from the source at different times will experience different fluctuations .",
    "we are interested in the change in the coherence functional due to the non - trivial state of the photon field , so define a renormalized coherence functional @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the functional in the minkowski vacuum state . in our case , one finds that @xmath38 where @xmath14 is the fine structure constant , @xmath39 is the normalization volume , and @xmath40 is the frequency of the excited photon mode . in addition , @xmath41 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] which does not depend on the electron emission time @xmath42 and is always positive definite . thus the sign of @xmath43",
    "is solely determined by the quantity @xmath44\\ , ,     \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47    the behavior of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath42 for fixed @xmath49 is illustrated in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fi : squeezed_state ] .",
    "the key feature is that @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "this means that for electrons emitted during this interval , we have @xmath52 , an increase of contrast compared to the photon vacuum state .",
    "this is the phenomenon of _ recoherence_. the minimum value of @xmath53 in the interval @xmath51 is @xmath54 , plotted in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fi : squeezed_state ] , form which we see that @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the averages of @xmath48 and of @xmath43 , respectively , over the interval @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 upon @xmath49 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fi : squeezed_state1 ] , where we see that @xmath58 .",
    "this bound limits the degree of recoherence , and is analogous to the quantum inequalities which limit the magnitude and duration of negative energy densities in quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "marecki@xcite has recently derived variants of the quantum inequalities for limiting the amount of squeezing which might be observed in photodetection experiments in quantum optics .",
    "the bounds on @xmath56 and on @xmath59 are sufficient to ensure that unitarity is always preserved , so that @xmath18 . thus the recoherence effect can never be greater in magnitude that the decoherence in the vacuum state .",
    "the bound given above may be used to make estimates of the maximum recoherence .",
    "if we assume that @xmath59 attains its maximum value , then for a single mode in a box , we find @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the wavelength of the excited mode .",
    "this estimate was derived assuming non - relativistic motion and periodic boundary conditions . however , it should serve as a rough estimate for more realistic cavities . for a rough estimate ,",
    "let us take @xmath62 and @xmath63 , corresponding to the lowest frequency mode in the cavity and a path separation of the order of the cavity size .",
    "this leads to @xmath64 non - relativistic motion requires @xmath65 .",
    "if , for example , we take @xmath66 , we would get the estimate @xmath67 .",
    "the case where a finite bandwidth of modes is excited is treated in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "if @xmath68 is the bandwidth of excited modes and @xmath69 is the solid angle within which they lie , then one finds the estimate @xmath70 all of the factors in the above expression , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath69 , should be small compared to unity for our analysis to be strictly valid . if we take all three of these factors to be of order @xmath73 , then we would obtain @xmath74 .",
    "in this article , we have reviewed selected aspects of decoherence , using coherent electrons coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field as our model quantum system .",
    "this system exhibits all three forms of decoherence , dephasing , entanglement , and `` which - path '' information .",
    "the basic effect of the photon field can be described either as photon emission or as aharonov - bohm phase fluctuations .",
    "if the photon field is not in its vacuum state , then the decoherence is typically larger than in the vacuum .",
    "however , we have discussed how this can be reversed for selected quantum states , resulting in recoherence .",
    "the phenomenon of recoherence is a sub - vacuum phenomenon , similar to quantum violations of the weak energy condition .",
    "both effects are limited in magnitude by quantum inequalities .",
    "although the effect of recoherence is small , its eventual measurement is a possibility .",
