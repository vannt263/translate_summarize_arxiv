    "different approaches for the quantum gravity have been proposed to provide a set of predictions for a minimum measurable length , a maximum observable momentum and an essential modification of the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on modification in the fundamental commutation relation @xmath1 $ ] . according to string theory ( st ) and black hole physics ( bhp ) , the modification is proportional to a quadratic moment @xcite . based on doubly spacial relativity ( dsr ) ,",
    "a proportionality to first order momenta ( linear ) has been suggested @xcite .",
    "different minimal length scale scenarios inspired by various approaches to the quantum gravity have been reviewed in @xcite .",

    "@xcite , which shall be utilized in this work , predicts maximum observable momenta and minimal measurable length .",
    "it is consistent with dsr , st and bhp .",
    "furthermore , it ensures that @xmath2=0=[p_i , p_j]$ ] through jacobi identity .",
    "accordingly , a modification of the uncertainty principle near the planck energy scale reads & = & i . [ comm01 ] apparently",
    ", this suggests a modification of the physical momentum @xcite p_i = p_0i ( 1 - p_0 + 2 ^ 2 p_0 ^ 2 )  , [ mom1 ] while @xmath3 with @xmath4 satisfying the canonical commutation relations @xmath5 = i \\hbar~\\delta_{ij } , $ ] such that , where @xmath6 is the momentum at low energy satisfying eq .",

    "the planck mass and length are given as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the dispersion relation is modified to the first order of @xmath14 as follows .",
    "e^2 = p_0 ^ 2 c^2 ( 1 - 2p_0 ) + m^2 c^4 .",
    "together with the modified energy - momentum conservation used in @xcite , this equation introduces a deformation of local lorentz invariance .",
    "this means that the bounds predicted from the effective field theory framework @xcite will not apply in our considered model .    the upper bounds on the parameter @xmath14 has been derived in @xcite and it was found that it could predict an intermediate length scale between planck scale and electroweak scale .",
    "it was suggested that these bounds can be measured using quantum optics techniques in @xcite which is considered as milestone in the quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "because of the modified physical momentum of eq.([mom1 ] ) , the classical hamiltonian as well as the quantum hamiltonian should be modified which affects a lot of quantum phenomena , and we think it is important to make a quantitative study of these effects which would open an interesting window for quantum gravity phenomenology especially if the gup parameter @xmath0 would take values between planck scale and electroweak scale . in a series of papers , the effects of gup on atomic , condensed matter systems , quark gluon plasma , preheating phase of the universe , inflationary era of the universe and black holes production at lhc have been investigated @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our investigations to study the impact of quantum gravity effects on the ground state properties of a fermi gas composed of @xmath15 ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "it was found by chandrasekhar @xcite that the white dwarfs can be described by ultra - relativistic ideal fermi gas at which quantum gravity effects could be considerable .",
    "therefore , we study the effect of gup on the number density , energy density and pressure . we discuss two kinds of the compact stars . the first one is a white dwarf , in which the mass contribution is mainly from the cold nuclei .",
    "the second kind is where the mass is mainly constituted of fermi gas . in context of compact stars , the earliest proposal on subatomic stars dates to 1970 , when it was proposed that there might exist compact stellar objects that might entirely made of very massive quarks , rather than confined baryons @xcite .",
    "for an isolated macroscopic body consisting of @xmath15 non - interacting and ultra - relativistic particles , the background of the particles motion is assumed to be flat .",
    "we study the ground state properties of a fermi gas composed of @xmath15 ultra - relativistic electrons , for which the state energy @xmath16 is entirely given by @xmath17 i.e. , temperature is much larger than the particle s rest mass .",
    "however , at vanishing or very low temperatures , the vacuum effect of fermions can be neglected i.e. , the total particle number is conserved . on the other hand , based on gup",
    "the particles move in quantized gravitational background",
    ". the modified state density due to gup has been derived using liouville theorem @xcite .    at vanishing temperature",
    ", the modified number of particle of fermi gas can be given as [ eq : pfermi1 ] n(p ) & = & v _ 0^p_f , where @xmath18 gives the fermi momentum .",

    "the white dwarfs have two properties @xcite ; the first one is that the electrons are described by relativistic dynamics and the second one is that the electron gas is completely degenerate .",

    "( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) , @xmath9 is normally assumed to be @xmath47.this can be thought of as the lower bound ( the physics becomes even more ill understood for sub - planckian , @xmath48 regimes ) .",
    "our analysis uses an upper bound , and hence a length scale @xmath49(planck length ) which is intermediate between the planck and the electroweak scale ( which it can not exceed on phenomenological grounds ) .",
    "we used the bound @xmath50 gev@xmath51 ( i.e. @xmath52 ) depending on the derived bounds on the parameter @xmath9 in @xcite .",
    "this bound was derived by calculating the effect of quantum gravity with non relativistic heavy meson systems like charmonium @xcite which may be a relevant example for the white dwarfs which is constituted mainly from non - relativistic nuclei .    based on these values , the quantum gravity correction to the mass of the white dwarf is given by    m_gup= m_0(1 + 10 ^ -5 ) .",
