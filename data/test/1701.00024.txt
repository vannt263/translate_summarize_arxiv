    "the interaction between high - energy jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their surroundings has long been a topic of great astrophysical interest .",
    "it is well known that agn feedback can control the size of a galaxy by influencing star formation , but the mechanism behind this is not well understood .",
    "several recent observations @xcite , as well as numerical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have demonstrated that agn feedback can be `` negative '' or `` positive . ''",
    "the exact astrophysical conditions in the jet and cloud are important in determining what direction feedback takes .",
    "jets can be roughly divided according to their fanaroff - riley classification @xcite .",
    "fast , energetic frii jets seem more likely to result in negative feedback . negative feedback curbs or even halts star formation , and is thought to result from the extreme radiative and kinetic energies of the jet , which heat and disperse the star - forming gas . additionally , the kinetic energy of a jet creates turbulence that can prevent ambient gas from cooling and subsequently coalescing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a study of the system 3c 326 by @xcite found that , despite the strong h@xmath1 line emission and an inferred molecular gas mass of 2 @xmath2 m@xmath3 , the star formation is 20 times lower than predicted by the kennicutt - schmidt law .",
    "they infer that turbulent heating from the jet is inhibiting star formation .",
    "other studies , though , suggest increased star formation may be seen in the cocoon of such jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , fri jets propagate through the ism / igm with energies high enough to create compression in the surrounding gas , but low enough to reduce the chance of significant turbulent heating .",
    "these jets are observed in positive feedback cases , wherein the effect of the jet serves to enhance star formation , including centaurus a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , 4c 41.17 @xcite , and minkowski s object ( hereafter m.o . )",
    "* hereafter c06 ) .",
    "we give more details on both positive and negative feedback in section [ sec : jetcloud ] .    in this paper , we focus on the case of m.o . , a peculiar star forming object located at a redshift of @xmath4 ( c06 ) that is currently being bombarded by a fr i radio jet from the nearby galaxy ngc 541 .",
    "system is of particular interest due to the lack of evidence for an especially dense ism or igm .",
    "there is also not much evidence for cold gas outside of the jet interaction site as is the case in centaurus a. as a result , it is unlikely that significant star formation would proceed in m.o . without the interaction of the jet .    a strong argument in favor of jet - induced star formation in m.o .",
    "is the morphology of the jet - cloud interaction site . outside of the jet interaction , the gas in m.o .",
    "is warm ( @xmath5 k ) and clumpy . near the jet interaction site",
    "there is a double structure of gas wrapped around the jet and numerous h@xmath1 regions ( c06 ) .",
    "c06 thus determined that it is likely that the jet interaction in m.o .",
    "caused the warm gas to cool into the h@xmath0 regions straddling the jet , in contrast to the pre - existing cold gas regions in centaurus a. also , the star forming regions in m.o . correlate with the jet - cloud morphology ; the region where the star formation is the highest is the center of the jet - cloud interaction , and the star formation rate ( sfr ) decreases laterally from this point ( c06 ) . unless m.o . happens to be a very unique system",
    ", then it may be that jet - induced star formation is a more general phenomenon than previously thought .",
    "the present work can be viewed as an extension of our earlier study of the interactions of radiative shocks with clouds @xcite .",
    "that work focused mostly on the effects of planar shocks overtaking individual ( or small collections of ) warm clumps on the scale of @xmath6 pc . in the current work ,",
    "we explore the much richer problem of a full jet intersecting an inhomogeneous intergalactic cloud on the scale of tens of kpc .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : section 2 covers the theory behind jet - cloud interactions , section 3 describes the numerical models used to capture the m.o .",
    "system , section 4 details the simulation results , and section 5 concludes the findings .",
    "the basic idea of jet - induced star formation ( i.e. positive feedback ) is that the collision of the jet with the cloud will trigger a series of shocks within the cloud .",
    "the immediate effect of these shocks will be to compress and heat the gas . depending on how the radiative processes scale with density and temperature",
    ", the net result can be to dramatically increase the radiative efficiency within the cloud .",
    "if the temperature dependence is shallower than the density dependence , the cloud can enter a phase of runaway cooling .",
    "this process occurs most quickly in relatively over - dense regions of the original cloud .",
    "these over - dense regions then proceed to collapse at an accelerating pace .",
    "provided some of these clumps start sufficiently close to the jeans limit , this collapse will push them beyond this limit , such that gravitational collapse can take over and the clump will proceed to form stars .",
    "the properties of the jet and cloud are key to controlling this process . for positive feedback to be important",
    ", the initial cloud must be dense enough for some parts to be reasonably close to the jeans limit .",
    "the temperature must also be such that any increase in temperature is met with a dramatic increase in cooling ( the hydrogen cooling edge at @xmath5 k is a good example ) .",
    "it generally helps for the jet to be significantly less dense than the cloud .",
    "finally , the jet velocity needs to be fast enough to trigger shocks in the cloud , yet not so fast that the cloud is disrupted before cooling can have much of an effect .",
    "our numerical simulations are performed using the well - tested _",
    "cosmos++ _ computational astrophysics code @xcite , specifically its newtonian hydrodynamics solvers .",
    "_ cosmos++ _ carries over many of the multi - physics capabilities found in its predecessor code _",
    "cosmos _ @xcite .",
    "the newtonian solvers have previously been utilized to study the bar mode instability in magnetized , rotating neutron stars @xcite and the galactic center g2 event @xcite .",
    "the current work uses the high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) scheme , which was described in its relativistic form in @xcite .",
    "as there are few differences between the relativistic and newtonian forms , we do not give a full presentation here , focusing instead on the packages that are most important to this paper : chemistry , cooling , and star formation .",
    "note that , although magnetic fields can play an important role in shock - induced star formation ( cf .",
    "* ) , they are not considered in this work .",
    "most prior numerical studies of stimulated star formation from jet - generated shocks have been hampered by the resolution of the computational mesh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the present work ,",
    "we significantly improve on previous resolution limitations by employing the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capabilities of _ cosmos++_. _ cosmos++ _ employs a _",
    "amr scheme , in which refinement and de - refinement decisions are made on a cell - by - cell basis , using an oct - tree network to traverse the grid hierarchy .",
    "each level of refinement doubles the spatial resolution in each dimension within a given parent cell .",
    "this style of local amr scheme ensures that the refinement and de - refinement conform as closely as possible to the shape of the region of interest , in this case the shocks and unstable cooling fronts triggered inside the cloud by the jet .    in this work",
    ", we present an idealized case of a direct , axially symmetric collision between a jet and a pre - existing spherical cloud . as such , it is a simple , and well controlled , test simulation , though its correspondence with m.o .",
    "is imperfect . in the case of m.o . , it is thought that the collision was between a jet and a stellar bridge connecting the elliptical galaxy , ngc 541 , with the interacting galaxies , ngc 545/547 ( c06 ) .",
    "there is also evidence that the jet is slowly sweeping across m.o .",
    "( c06 ) . despite these differences , the correspondence in parameters between our simulation and m.o .",
    "ensure that our results are applicable and the simulation can be used to better understand the dynamics of this particular object and of jet - induced star formation more generally .",
    "although we performed some two - dimensional simulations to test different code options and explore our parameter space , we mostly focus on reporting the results of our 3d simulations .",
    "the 3d simulations have a base resolution of either @xmath7 or @xmath8 zones to cover a domain that is approximately @xmath9 with reflection boundaries applied in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-directions , so that we only simulate one quadrant of the full problem .",
    "the finest spatial resolution achieved is 19.5 pc per zone , reached by including 2 levels of refinement on top of the @xmath8 base mesh , equivalent to a uniform mesh of @xmath12 zones .",
    "the criterion used for refinement is that any zone with @xmath13 @xmath14 is kept at the maximum refinement , while zones that fall below @xmath15 @xmath14 are allowed to de - refine , provided neighboring zones never differ by more than one level of refinement and no zone is allowed to drop below the base resolution .",
    "zones are checked against the refinement and de - refinement criteria once every ten evolution steps in the numerical code .",
    "we find that a minimum resolution close to our base value is required even in the background in order to get reasonable convergence in the star formation rate ( as will be discussed in section [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "the cloud , which represents the parent object of m.o .",
    ", is initialized with a radius of @xmath16 pc .",
    "it is , therefore , somewhat smaller , in terms of projected area , than the real value of 275 kpc@xmath17 ( c06 ) .",

    "this gives a value around @xmath27 k. each simulation is run for five sound - crossing - times , @xmath28 , of the cloud , which corresponds to about 73 myr total . to avoid numerical problems caused by the background gas density dropping too far below its initial value",

    "since the amount of gas is comparable , this suggests that the cooling and star formation in the simulations are not nearly as efficient as they are in m.o . the sizable discrepancy in h@xmath0 could be reduced if we included the effects of self - shielding , which would reduce the amount of photodissociation and increase the yield of h@xmath0 . however , even in simulations where we completely ignore photodissociation , we still find the h@xmath0 mass to be at least two orders of magnitude too low .",

    "in this work , we use 2d and 3d simulations to model the evolution of a radio jet impacting a single , dwarf - galaxy - scale cloud in a direct , axially - symmetric collision .",
    "our intention is to use these simulations to better understand observations of m.o . , the peculiar starburst galaxy located at the termination point of the radio jet from ngc 541 .    our first , main conclusion is that jet - induced star formation ( i.e. positive feedback ) is possible under this scenario .",
    "figures [ fig : sfr][fig : history ] all show dramatic increases in star formation attributable to the jet interaction .",
    "interestingly , we find that most of the star formation in our 3d simulations takes place in a propagating ring centered about the jet axis ( figure [ fig : formation ] ) .",
    "the ring lies at the intersection of a forward propagating shock driven into the cloud by the jet and a spherical compression shock driven by the over - pressure cocoon ( figure [ fig : slices ] ) .",
    "these rings may potentially explain the torus of star formation observed in m.o .",
    "importantly , this star formation is occurring upstream of an ring ( compare figures [ fig : volume ] and [ fig : formation ] ) , also consistent with observations ( c06 ) .    additionally , the velocity histogram of our star particles peaks at @xmath122 km s@xmath34 ( left panel of figure [ fig : histogram ] ) , which is again consistent with observations ( c06 ) . the spatial distribution of the star particle velocities is also interesting .",
    "the fastest moving star particles are found furthest downstream ( figures [ fig : stars_2d ] and [ fig : stars ] ) .",

    "is imperfect .",
    "the main discrepancy is that our measured star formation rate is about a factor of 6 lower than the observed value .",
    "c06 also suggested that the star formation rate in m.o . may have been even higher in the past .",
    "along with not producing the expected mass of stars , our simulations also fall short on the amount of h@xmath0 they produce .    in the paper ,",

    ", increasing the jet velocity by a factor of 5 actually lowered the s.f.r . and destroyed the cloud on a relatively short timescale .",
    "a similar strong sensitivity to the shock velocity was seen in our earlier work @xcite . going the other direction and significantly lowering",
    "the jet velocity would introduce a different problem ",
    "star formation would likely proceed too slowly .",
    "once the first generation of massive stars form , there is only a limited amount of time ( of the order a few myr ) for star formation to continue before negative feedback , in the form of heating from the first massive stars , would effectively shut it off @xcite .",
    "this effect might explain why the s.f.r . in m.o .",
    "appears to be lower now that it was in the past  negative feedback may already be kicking in .",
