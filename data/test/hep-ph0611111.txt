    "we comment on other possible sources of gravitinos .",

    "it is diluted by a factor of @xmath186 where @xmath187 the temperature at which @xmath3 oscillation starts to dominate ( see discussion in the subsection  [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "if @xmath3 oscillation starts during the reheating process after inflation , which is the case in our scenario in order not to thermalize the messenger fields , the amount of thermal gravitinos does not depend on the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "it is given in terms of the parameters of the model and the initial amplitude @xmath188 by @xmath189 this is sub - dominant when @xmath190 .",

    "again entropy production reduces the amount of nlsps by a factor of @xmath191 $ ] , where @xmath192 is the freezing out temperature of pair annihilation processes  @xcite .",
    "the superwimp component of gravitino dark matter is therefore negligible in the parameter regions of our interest",

    "the gravitinos need to be sufficiently non - relativistic before the structure formation to start .",
    "the free - streaming scale of the dark matter is constrained to be less than @xmath78  mpc by the matter power spectrum inferred from lyman-@xmath193 forest  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the free - streaming scale @xmath194 of the gravitinos .",
    "we find that it is sufficiently small , but interestingly it may be large enough to be distinguished from that of cold dark matter . the free - streaming scale at the time of matter - radiation equality @xmath195 is defined by @xmath196 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are scale factors at matter - radiation equality and at the time of @xmath3 decays , respectively .",

    "up to logarithmic dependence , we obtain @xmath200    for case ( b ) , @xmath201 is in an interesting range for the small - scale structure problem in @xmath38cdm model .",
    "although not conclusive , it has been reported that there are discrepancies between simulations of structure formation in the cold dark matter scenario and observation at a small scale .",
    "the observed number of galactic satellites in the inner region ( @xmath202 ) of halo is an order of magnitude smaller than results of simulations  @xcite .",
    "also , simulation of the structure formation predicts a cuspy profile in the central region of halo  @xcite whereas observations such as studies of gravitational lensing  @xcite and rotation curves  @xcite indicate nearly uniform density core structure .",
    "it has been studied that dark matter with free - streaming scales of @xmath203  mpc may resolve these issues because it can smear out the density fluctuation in small scale  @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for recent proposals of particle physics models which realize large @xmath201 via non - thermally produced dark matter . )",
    "a free - streaming scale of @xmath204  kpc means that there is a cut - off in matter power spectrum below that scale . it might be possible to probe this small - scale structure in future experiments by using strong gravitational lensing  @xcite such as in lsst  @xcite and snap  @xcite , and also by observations of 21 cm fluctuations in high red - shift region  @xcite .      in the previous section",
    ", we have assumed that the oscillation energy density dominates over the universe before it decays .",
    "we discuss the amount of entropy production and possible baryogenesis scenarios here .",
    "as we have discussed , the @xmath3 field starts to oscillate when the hubble parameter becomes smaller than @xmath205 .",
    "there are two cases which we need to consider separately .",
    "if the oscillation starts during the reheating process after inflation ( the inflaton oscillation era ) , @xmath3-domination happens when : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "a different result is obtained if @xmath3 starts to oscillate in a radiation - dominated era ( after reheating ) .",
    "the temperature at which @xmath3 starts to oscillate is given by @xmath208 in this case , @xmath187 is @xmath209 the dilution factor @xmath210 is then @xmath211 the primordial radiation and matter are diluted by this amount .",
    "( @xmath3-domination does not happen if @xmath210 is larger than unity . ) with the low decay temperature @xmath212 , dilution effects are quite large .",
    "for example , if @xmath213 and @xmath214 , the dilution factor is @xmath215 .",
    "this dilutes unwanted relics such as thermally produced neutralinos to a negligible level .",
    "since baryon asymmetry is also diluted , primordial baryon asymmetry needs to be larger such as @xmath216 .",
    "it is a non - trivial task to obtain such a large asymmetry under a condition that the reheating temperature can not be too high in order not to thermally produce the messenger particles ( min@xmath217 \\ll \\lambda \\langle s \\rangle$ ] ) .",
    "examples of possible scenarios for baryogenesis are the right - handed sneutrino inflation scenario  @xcite and scenario with right - handed sneutrino dominated universe  @xcite . in those scenarios , baryon asymmetry is generated via leptogenesis  @xcite after the decay of right - handed sneutrinos as follows : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is an effective cp violating phase and @xmath220 corresponds to the heaviest neutrino mass , and @xmath207 denotes the decay temperature of the right handed sneutrino .",
    "after dilution by the @xmath3 decay , it reduces to @xmath221 independent of @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the observed baryon asymmetry @xmath224  @xcite can be consistently explained with a slightly suppressed initial amplitude @xmath225 .",
    "note here that if the initial amplitude @xmath91 is suppressed to this level , thermally produced gravitinos can give a non - negligible contribution to the matter density ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : thermal ] ) ) , and also the decay of thermally produced nlsps during bbn may put constraints on species of the nlsp and/or @xmath222 .",
    "taking into account gravity effects in supersymmetry breaking / mediation models opens up a possibility of very simple gauge mediation .",
    "we have considered the simplest model of gauge mediation , in which we have only two parameters .",
    "one combination of the parameters needs to be fixed so that we obtain the gaugino masses to be @xmath6  gev , and the other has preferable range from a simple solution to the @xmath0-problem and grand unification , i.e. , 10  mev @xmath226  gev .",
    "this is the simplest model of gauge mediation , but amazingly free from problems .",
    "we have shown that @xmath3 rolls into the supersymmetry breaking vacuum with generic initial conditions .",
    "the entropy production by the @xmath3 decay dilutes gravitinos and neutralinos which are thermally ( over)produced .",
    "supersymmetric particles do not cause the fcnc or cp problems as the gravitino mass is small enough .",
    "of the most amazing is the consistency of the dark - matter abundance .",
    "we can calculate the abundance of the non - thermally produced gravitinos from @xmath3 decays in terms of the two parameters in the model . within the parameter region of our interest ,",
    "the calculated amount can account for the dark matter of the universe .",
    "we thank ted baltz and masamune oguri for useful discussion on dark matter .",
    "r.k . would like to thank paddy fox , hitoshi murayama and yasunori nomura for stimulating discussion and jay wacker for discussion on non - perturbative particle production during the @xmath3 oscillation .",

    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : evolution ] , the minimum of the scalar potential during inflation is likely to be around @xmath227 .",
    "the singlet field @xmath3 may couple to the inflaton sector in the superpotential , @xmath228 where @xmath229 is a coefficient of @xmath230 , and @xmath231 denotes the superpotential of a inflaton sector .",
    "the scalar potential of @xmath3 during inflation is then given by @xmath232 where the first term originates from the khler potential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the second term from the superpotential in eq .  ( [ eq : stoinf ] ) . in the above expression",
    ", we have used the hubble equation , @xmath233 assuming that the @xmath1-component of the inflaton dominates the energy density during inflation .",
    "this potential has a minimum at @xmath234 .    in principle",
    ", the @xmath229 parameter can be much larger than @xmath78 depending on a uv completion of the theory .",
    "for example , in a model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the theory above the scale @xmath38 is a strongly coupled conformal field theory , and the @xmath229 parameter is enhanced to be @xmath235 . if this is the case , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubblemass ] ) pushes the minimum to the planck scale .",
    "however , the effective theory in terms of @xmath3 does not make sense for @xmath236 , and it is more appropriate to consider the dynamics in terms of the constituent field @xmath41 .",
    "the constituent field @xmath41 , in contrast to @xmath3 , may have a positive hubble mass squared around the symmetry enhancement point at @xmath237 .",
    "this hubble mass term attracts @xmath41 to the origin , and it prevents @xmath238 from going to the planck scale .",
