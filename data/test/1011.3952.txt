    "understanding transport of charged solutes across the cell membrane is a problem of paramount importance in biophysics , since it is crucial to regulate many cell functions @xcite .",
    "this task is undertaken by transmembrane channels , so the characterization of the permeation of charged particles , ions in particular , is essential .",
    "in addition , recently there has been a renewed interest to comprehend transport through biological nanochannels for possible applications in biotechnology @xcite .",
    "bacterial porins are macromolecular proteins located at the outer membrane that enable the diffusion of small molecules through the lipid bilayer .",
    "as porins are well characterized , both structurally and functionally , they represent model systems to study transport through biological nanochannels . in particular , the ionic transport properties of the ompf porin have been extensively studied since the determination of its x - ray structure @xcite .",
    "the simplest description of the complex problem of ionic transport across channels is based on the classical diffusion - advection transport equations : @xmath2 @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the flux of particles of a given ion of charge @xmath5 and @xmath6 its concentration profile , @xmath0 is a constant diffusion coefficient characterizing the brownian motion ( with a value in principle different from bulk diffusion coefficient ) and @xmath7 is a deterministic force . in the classical nernst - planck equations ,",
    "the deterministic force arises from the mean - field electrostatic potential , @xmath8 @xcite , whereas in more advanced approaches it may contain steric or entropic forces @xcite .    in some cases ,",
    "integrated solutions of eqs.([cons],[np ] ) under suitable boundary conditions and appropriate assumptions are employed . the goldman - hodkin - katz equation or the henderson equation",
    "are well - known examples , being extensively used in the literature to understand the conductance , reversal potential , and other measurable quantities of nanochannels @xcite . in other cases , it is solved self - consistently in combination with poisson s equation of electrostatics , forming the so - called poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) equations .",
    "this approach allows the analysis of electrically charged nanochannels in a consistent fashion @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "a continuous mean - field approximation is assumed , i.e. ions are treated not as discrete entities but as continuous charged densities that represent the space - time average of the microscopic motion of the ions .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of ions , @xmath0 , characterize their motion within the channel , representing a spatial average over the region considered . in analyzing experiments ,",
    "diffusion coefficients are often given bulk values when the comparison with experiment is qualitative or are treated as free parameters to adjust by fitting experimental data @xcite . + in recent years , the increase in computer power and the development of new algorithms have permitted the study of ion transport through certain nanochannels employing all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "such analysis captures all the atomic detail of the system ( including the water molecules present ) , which in some cases is necessary to properly account for the interactions of the ions with the interior of the channel .",
    "however , these md simulations still remain computationally very expensive , so its use is hindered by limitations in the size of the system ( @xmath9 nm ) and the duration of the processes ( @xmath10 ns ) that such calculations are capable of tackling .",
    "nevertheless , even for the analysis of larger systems or longer processes , all - atom md simulations can be used to obtain parameters that coarser ( less detailed ) models employ in their description of the system . in particular ,",
    "md simulations can be used to obtain diffusion coefficients of ions in the interior of nanochannels , which are central input parameters in many theoretical descriptions of ion permeation ( like , e.g. , brownian dynamics simulations @xcite or approaches based on the nernst - planck equation @xcite ) .",
    "tieleman and berendsen @xcite characterized the diffusive dynamics of water molecules in the ompf porin by using the einstein relation for the mean square displacement ( msd ) .",
    "they calculated local diffusion coefficients which they averaged out over slices perpendicular to the axis of the pore to obtain the variation of the diffusion coefficient along the axis of the channel .",
    "a similar approach was used with the ompf porin @xcite and other channels@xcite to determine the dependence of ionic diffusion coefficients along their axial direction .",
    "such approaches , however , do not provide global diffusion coefficients to describe the entire channel , and it is not clear how they can be determined . to circumvent that limitation , hijkoop et al .",
    "@xcite , inspired on the work of munakata and kaneko @xcite , used a method based on a first passage time ( fpt ) analysis to compute a global diffusion coefficient of water in the interior of an artificial ( uncharged ) ompf porin .",
    "their analysis , however , ignores the influence of free energy barriers and wells on the local movements of water molecules at a specific position along the axis of the pore .    in this paper",
    ", we use a method based on a first passage time ( fpt ) analysis of the particles trajectories to study the transport of potassium and chloride ions through the ompf porin .",
    "this procedure allows us to obtain the effective diffusion coefficients of the ions in the channel from all - atom md simulations @xcite . on the one hand , from the trajectories of the ions provided by the simulations one can calculate several fpt quantities that characterize their passage through the channel .",
    "note that such quantities are produced taking into account all the complexity of the all - atom description . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to derive analytical expressions of such fpt quantities for a model based on the 1d diffusion - advection equations with constant parameters , eqs.([cons],[np ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the fpt quantities obtained from the md simulations with the analytical formulas give answer to two relevant questions for the characterization of the channel .",
    "first , it determines whether the one - dimensional description of the dynamics of the ions in the channel based on eqs.([cons],[np ] ) is valid .",
    "second , in case such a description is accurate , we can obtain the diffusion coefficients and effective forces that best define the channel by fitting the fpt quantities calculated from the md simulations with their corresponding analytical expressions .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ompf + simulation methods ] we describe the structure of the ompf porin and discuss the model and the details of the md simulations . in section",

    "effective diffusion coefficients and forces are obtained for the different regions . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , the conclusions of the study are given , as well as a table with the obtained diffusion coefficients that characterize the ionic transport of the channel .",
    "the biological nanochannel considered here , the outer membrane protein f ( ompf porin ) , is a transmembrane channel located at the outer membrane of the bacteria _ escherichia coli_. the structure of the wt ompf channel is illustrated in figure [ channel ] .",
    "the crystallographical structure of the wild type ompf channel is well known from long ago @xcite .",

    "let us consider a diffusing brownian particle under the action of an external force in a one dimensional interval @xmath18 $ ] . to characterize its dynamics in the interval one can compute first passage quantities , which deal with the event of the particle reaching for the first time any of the boundaries ( first passage event ) .",
    "the central magnitude that characterizes these events ( from which other first passage quantities can be calculated ) is the distribution of first passage times , given a starting position of the particle within the interval .",
    "this is obtained from the probability that the particle reaches for the first time any of the boundaries at a given time @xmath19 .",
    "this first passage problem is , thus , approximately equivalent to the problem of a diffusing particle in an interval @xmath18 $ ] with absorbing boundaries @xcite .",
    "the analysis based on a first passage approach is well suited to characterize the dynamics of the ions in the channel from the results of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "one can easily calculate the different first - passage quantities characterizing the ions dynamics inside a given interval within the channel from inspection of the individual trajectories provided by the simulations results .",
    "a first passage quantity that we employ in our analysis is the _ hitting probability_. it is defined as the probability that a particle which starts at an initial position @xmath20 reaches for the first time either the lower boundary at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or the upper one at @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath20 is determined by the presence of free energy barriers and external forces acting on the ions .",
    "the calculation of the hitting probability from the md trajectories of the ions is simple . at each timestep of the simulation",
    "we identify the ions contained within the layer @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 nm ( thiner layers were tested with identical results ) .",
    "we then trace all those particles until they reach for the first time any of the virtual boundaries of the interval , moment at which they loose their identity ( although they are not physically removed from the system ) . by keeping track of the number of ions that reach each boundary",
    "we can compute , once we have gone through all the simulation , the hitting probabilities of each type of ion for a given initial position @xmath20 . the same procedure is repeated for different starting points @xmath20 ( separated by @xmath28 ) until the whole interval is covered to obtain the hitting probabilities from md simulations , @xmath29 .",
    "another magnitude of interest in the application of the fpt approach to the analysis of ionic dynamics in the channel is the _",

    "it is defined as the average time taken for a particle to reach for the first time any of the boundaries given that its initial position is @xmath20 . to calculate the met from the md simulations results we divide the system into layers of width @xmath28 as done before , and at each timestep identify the ions within the layer centered at @xmath20 .",
    "those particles are tracked until they reach either boundary and the time elapsed is recorded . from the collection of residence times of the particles starting at @xmath20",
    "we compute the average time to reach either boundary .",
    "this is repeated for all @xmath20 in the interval to obtain the met from md simulations , @xmath31 .",
    "the other fpt quantity that we use in the characterization of ion dynamics in the channel is the _ survival probability _ , @xmath32 .",
    "it gives the probability at time @xmath19 of finding a particle within the domain @xmath33 $ ] that will cross the domain from one boundary to the other without crossing the entrance at intermediate times . for the calculation of this quantity , at each timestep of the simulation we identify those ions that enter the considered interval and , for each particle , we record the time of entrance into the interval and a tag which specifies the boundary of entrance . as done in the previous cases , we track those particles until they reach any of the boundaries , where they loose their identity .",
    "if the boundary of exit is the same as the boundary of entrance the trajectory is discarded . if the particle exits through the opposite boundary , the exit time is recorded so we can compute the time taken by that particle to cross the interval . from the collection of the crossing times",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the survival probability from md simulations , @xmath34 . in the presence of an external effective force dragging the ions",
    ", there are many more events of ions crossing the interval in the direction of the dragging force than in the opposite direction . in order to provide statistically meaningful results ,",
    "only the survival probability corresponding to the passage of ions in the direction of the dragging force will be considered .",
    "the fpt quantities obtained from the md simulations can be used to check the validity and to extract the parameters of a certain theoretical model .",

    ", we can test the applicability of the model and also , under favorable conditions , determine the parameters @xmath36 that define such model .",

    "note also that eq.([jfj ] ) is a particular case of eq.([cons],[np ] ) with a deterministic force arising from free energy barriers , @xmath109 .    from eq.([jfj ] ) we can infer that the effective forces obtained in the vestibules from the analysis of first passage quantities can be decomposed into two additive contributions : @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the component of the force arising from electrostatic interactions , whose sign depends on the charge of the ion under consideration .",
    "@xmath112 accounts for the effective entropic force , which depends solely on the shape of the channel and which points towards the direction that maximizes the available space .",
    "hitting probability , , @xmath113 , of reaching the upper boundary for water particles in ( a ) vestibule1 ( b ) vestibule2.,width=321 ]    with the help of eqs.([feff ] ) , we can obtain the two contributions , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , from the values of the total effective force computed from the first passage analysis , @xmath114 in vestibule1 , the resultant effective electrostatic force is @xmath115 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm , and the entropic part is @xmath116k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm . in vestibule2 , the resultant electrostatic component is @xmath117 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm , and the entropic part is @xmath118 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm .    to confirm the existence of a charge independent entropic force arising from the variation of the available space along the axis of the channel",
    ", we have also analyzed the first passage properties of water molecules at both vestibules ( see figs.([pvestaigua_hittingprob ] ) ) .",
    "in this case , the only contribution to the effective force is entropic .",
    "for vestibule1 we find @xmath119 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm , and for vestibule2 we find @xmath120 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm .     survival probability of ions in ( a ) vestibule1 ( b ) vestibule2.,width=321 ]    at this point we can interpret qualitatively the results obtained from the analysis of the hitting probabilities at the two vestibules . in vestibule1 , the effective section of the channel decreases along the @xmath14-axis , which induces the appearance of an _ entropic force _ in the same direction as the external electric field ( antiparallel to the @xmath14-axis ) .",
    "thus , for cations both contributions to the effective force have the same direction whereas for anions they have opposite directions .",
    "as the entropic part is dominant , the effective force on both ions is directed towards decreasing @xmath14 values , although its magnitude is larger on potassium ions than on chloride ions . in vestibule2 , on the contrary , the effective section of the channel increases along the @xmath14-axis , so the _ entropic force _ is directed towards increasing @xmath14 values , and the two contributions of the effective force have the same direction for anions and opposite directions for cations .",
    "hence , in this case the total effective force is in the direction of the @xmath14-axis and its magnitude is larger for chloride ions than for potassium ions .",
    "mean exit time of ions in ( a ) vestibule1 ( b ) vestibule2 as a function of their initial position.,width=321 ]    the entropic force can be independently estimated using eqs.([jfj ] ) from the dependence of the effective radius of the channel on the @xmath14-coordinate , as computed from the md simulations .",
    "we obtain an average @xmath121 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm at vestibule1 and an average @xmath122 k@xmath89t@xmath90/nm at vestibule2 .",
    "the discrepancies in the precise values obtained for the entropic forces were expected , since the expressions used are only valid for smoother changes of the section of the channel along the @xmath14-coordinate .",
    "once the effective forces have been determined we can obtain the values of the diffusion coefficients .",
    "the logarithmic fit of the time dependence of the survival probabilities , @xmath34 , provides the diffusion coefficients @xmath123 nm@xmath95/ns and @xmath124 nm@xmath95/ns in vestibule1 , and @xmath125 nm@xmath95/ns , @xmath126 nm@xmath95/ns in vestibule2 ( see figs.([pvest_survp ] ) ) .",
    "independently , from the analysis of the mean exit times , we obtain @xmath127 nm@xmath95/ns , @xmath128 nm@xmath95/ns in vestibule1 and @xmath129 nm@xmath95/ns , @xmath130 nm@xmath95/ns in vestibule2 ( see figs.([pvest_met ] ) )",
    ". again , such an agreement of the parameters , obtained from two independent methods , shows the consistency and robustness of the fpt procedure employed to extract the values of the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the diffusive dynamics of chloride and potassium ions in the interior of the ompf porin under the influence of an external electric field directed along its axis . from the results of extensive all - atom molecular dynamics simulations of the system we computed several first passage time quantities to characterize the dynamics of the ions in the interior of the channel .",
    "such quantities , calculated considering all the complexity of the system , provide valuable information on the residence times and presence of free energy barriers for ions in the interior of the ompf porin .",
    "these fpt quantities were also used to test the validity of simplified 1d descriptions of the dynamics of the ions in the interior of the channel based on the use of constant diffusion coefficients for the ions .",
    "overall , our results show a slow and complex dynamics for the ions inside the channel .",
    "the sluggish ionic dynamics inside the channel is characterized by large residence times ( @xmath131 0.8 ns for cl@xmath60 and @xmath132 ns for k@xmath61 ) and very large mean exit times with peaks around @xmath133 ns , see figure [ pall_met ] , which indicate a strong interaction of the channel with the ions .",
    "the complexity of the dynamics is demonstrated by the fact that it is not possible to characterize chloride and potassium ions in the interior of the channel with a single diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , it is possible to find well - defined diffusion coefficients for some regions of the protein channel .    based on its x - ray structure , we have divided the channel into three different regions : constriction , vestibule 1 and vestibule 2 . employing the same fpt analysis",
    "we demonstrate that each of such regions is describable by a simple model characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and a constant deterministic force @xmath1 acting on the ions .",
    "the diffusion coefficients @xmath0 which characterize the dynamics of chloride and potassium ions in the different regions , obtained by two independent methods , are given in table [ table : results ] .",
    "let us remark that these diffusion coefficients vary by almost an order of magnitude from the bulk to the interior of the constriction .",
    "the physical origin of the effective force @xmath1 is also different in the different regions of the channel .",
    "the effective forces on the ions at the constriction , as inferred from the fpt results of the md simulations , correspond to the presence of an intense local electric field directed along the applied electric field which drags potassium ions along and chloride ions in the opposite direction . in the vestibules ,",
    "the effective forces observed on the ions are consistent with the expected effect of entropic forces which arise from the variation of the available space along the axis of the channel ( see eq.([jfj ] ) ) .",
    "cc|c|c| & & + & & survival prob .",

    ". such models ( like , e.g. , the pnp approach ) are based on the classical 1d transport equations @xcite ( see eq.([cons],[np ] ) ) and heavily rely on the existence of a well - defined diffusion coefficient .",
    "our work strongly suggests that in general a direct use of a constant diffusion coefficient for the whole channel is not justified .",
    "however , it also shows the plausibility of a multi scaling approach , in which these models would play an important role . the idea is to take into account the complexity of the structure of the protein by obtaining diffusion coefficients from detailed md simulations in regions of different geometrical properties .",
    "the coefficients thus obtained can be used in the classical 1d descriptions of ionic channels , such as the pnp approach .",
    "also , we recall that our work further demonstrates that in such 1d descriptions , entropic forces such as those described in refs.@xcite must be taken into account . work in this direction of a multi - scaling approach",
