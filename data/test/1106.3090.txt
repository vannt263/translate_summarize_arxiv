    "the fundamental magnetic behavior at the nanoscale has attracted considerable attention due to potential technological applications such as magnetic data storage@xcite and energy storage lithium ion batteries.@xcite because of the finite size of nanoscale magnetic materials , the large surface - to - core ratio becomes significant and , in some cases , explains the fascinating nanoscale behavior . the number of nearest neighbors for an atom at the surface is significantly reduced compared to the bulk with the consequence that the magnetic exchange is lessened .",
    "consequently , the magnetization and the transition temperature to magnetic order may be substantially reduced when compared to the bulk .",
    "theoretical calculations have predicted this behavior.@xcite experimentally , this behavior has been observed in both 3@xmath4 metals@xcite and oxide samples such as mno@xcite and nio.@xcite in contrast , an increase has been observed in the magnetic ordering temperature and magnetic moment in several nanoscale materials.@xcite for example , in some nanoscale 3@xmath4 metals , the moment is enhanced as a result of band narrowing at the surface resulting from the reduced coordination number .",
    "this behavior has been observed experimentally in iron , cobalt and nickel clusters@xcite and has been supported by theoretical calculations.@xcite on the other hand , in ionic oxide compounds , due to the relatively localized electronic distribution the moment is less affected by the surface and surface disorder results in a reduced average moment.@xcite a reduced moment and enhanced transition temperature have been observed in mno particles@xcite and in the spinel ferrites ni(mn)fe@xmath5o@xmath6.@xcite in either case , the origin of the moment and ordering temperature enhancement or reduction is unclear and , consequently , further study of magnetic nanoparticles is important .",
    "the classic antiferromagnetic ( afm ) oxide compound mno is a good candidate for studying finite size effects due to its relatively simple structure and well - studied bulk properties .",
    "bulk mno shows an afm transition at @xmath0 @xmath7 118 k-120 k@xcite that occurs concomitantly with a rhombohedral structural distortion from the high temperature nacl structure.@xcite previous studies have shown that the antiferromagnetic order and structural transition of mno survive into the nanoscale regime.@xcite the nature of the effect and its root cause remain unresolved because in some studies an enhanced @xmath0 has been observed for confinement particles@xcite and core - shell particles@xcite while a suppressed @xmath0 is reported in so - called ultrafine particles.@xcite in another example of mno nanoparticles , only short range afm order is reported.@xcite the degree to which this difference in behavior is related to the magnetic domain size or to the surface preparation remains unclear .",
    "hence , studies that compare multiple sizes of nanoscale mno with similar surface preparations can shed light on the intrinsic magnetic behavior that results from size confinement .",
    "in this paper we report neutron diffraction measurements on two different sizes ( 8 nm and 13 nm ) of monodisperse spherical mno nanoparticles .",
    "the 8 ( 13 ) nm sample is denoted as sample a ( b ) in the following discussion .",
    "our results show that in sample a the afm transition temperature @xmath0 is suppressed while in sample b , @xmath0 is almost the same as bulk mno .",
    "the mn magnetic moment is similar in both samples and is about 80@xmath3 of the bulk value of 4.89 @xmath2/mn.@xcite from polarized neutron diffraction data we estimate that the surface to total ratio is about 20 % which appears to explain the reduction in the moment .",
    "monodisperse mno nanoparticles were synthesized through a modification of non - injection synthetic schemes.@xcite an important aspect of the synthesis process is the attachment of capping ligands which provides size control , minimizes interparticle interactions , and passivates the surface . to minimize difficulties associated with the large incoherent neutron scattering cross - section of hydrogen , deuterated capping ligands",
    "were used .",
    "approximately 10 batches for each sample size were combined to produce samples large enough for neutron scattering experiments(@xmath8 0.5 g each ) .",
    "two distinct sizes were studied , an 8 nm sample ( sample a ) and a 13 nm ( sample b ) .",
    "these particle sizes are determined from transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) of @xmath850 - 100 particles per sample . as will be discussed further below",
    ", a limitation of tem is the low number of particles sampled , however despite this limitation the tem can provide some information concerning the polydispersity of the samples studied here .",
    "the tem results on sample a give a particle size of 7.9 @xmath1 1.6 nm ( ref .",
    "25 ) and for sample b give a particle size of 13 @xmath1 2 nm ( see insets fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the shape of nanoparticle samples is an important consideration . aside from the difficulty in forming anisotropic particles of mno using our methods",
    ", there are two primary lines of evidence for the production of spherical particles .",
    "the first comes from tem images .",
    "if other shapes are formed , projection in two dimensions will reveal other geometries .",
    "for example , cubic nanoparticles will occasionally ( for suitable orientation ) reveal hexagonal shapes based on the 2d projection . additionally , if plates are formed , these are generally transparent in tem imaging and this was not the case here .",
    "furthermore , if growth occurs along a particular crystallographic face , this will be revealed in x - ray and neutron diffraction patterns .",
    "indeed , preferred growth directions will be associated with different peak widths for different reflections . in this case , no such divergence was found , consistent with the formation of isotropic ( _ i.e. _ , spherical ) particles , in strong corroboration of our tem results .",
    "x - ray diffraction with cu @xmath9 radiation ( @xmath10=1.5406  ) , and polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction experiments were performed .",
    "the neutron diffraction experiments were performed on several instruments : the hb1a triple - axis instrument with @xmath10 = 2.364  at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) , oak ridge national laboratory ; the c2 diffractometer at the canadian neutron beam centre ( nbc ) in chalk river , canada , with neutron wavelength of @xmath10 = 1.3306  and 2.3721  ; the general purpose neutron polarization analysis spectrometer , d7 , with @xmath10 = 3.073  at the institut laue - langevin in grenoble , france ; and the dns polarized diffuse scattering instrument with @xmath10 = 4.74  operated by the jlich centre for neutron science ( jcns ) at the forschungsneutronenquelle heinz maier - leibnitz ( frm ii ) , tu mnchen , germany .    to carefully extract the particle size as well as the magnetic domain size from a diffraction pattern ,",
    "it is important to properly account for instrumental resolution",
    ". a standard run on a mixture of nist si 640c and annealed yttria was performed to determine the instrumental resolution of c2 .",
    "similarly , a y@xmath11fe@xmath12o@xmath13 standard was used to determine the instrumental resolution of the d7 .",
    "for hb1a the instrumental resolution was obtained by comparing with a si standard and with a sample of bulk mno . the particle size and magnetic domain size",
    "were obtained from analysis of the ( 1 1 1 ) and ( 1/2 1/2 1/2)(pseudo cubic notation ) peak width using the standard scherrer formula@xcite and refinement of the diffraction pattern using fullprof.@xcite in particular , two methods were used to extract the particle size and magnetic domain size from the neutron diffraction data . in the first method , the instrumental resolution obtained as described above was convolved with the fitted gaussian peak width . in the second method ,",
    "the instrument resolution peak shape parameters were fixed and a peak broadening parameter , to account for finite size effects , was included in the fullprof refinements of the data .",

    "is required .",
    "previous polarized neutron scattering data on average 7 nm confinement geometry nanoparticles indicated that only 40@xmath3 of the mn atoms were ordered.@xcite however , the average magnetic moment is not reported . in the polarized data presented here on sample b at 1.5 k , from the peak - to - diffuse scattering ratio we can estimate that about 80 - 85@xmath3 of the mn atoms in a nanoparticle are magnetically ordered . assuming the actual magnetic moment of mn atoms in the nanoparticle is identical to the bulk value and scaling by the percent of the particle that actually participates in magnetically ordered state , the expected average moment in this sample would be 3.9 - 4.1 @xmath2/mn .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the nature of the surface spins has been discussed frequently in the literature .",
    "in particular , magnetic susceptibility measurements have been interpreted in terms of weak ferromagnetism and related superparamagnetic like behavior of uncompensated surface spins.@xcite however , the size dependence of the superparamagnetic behavior appears to be inversely related to particle size in contrast to the direct relationship expected for a superparamagnetic particle .",
    "morales , _ _ et al.__@xcite have proposed that the mn residing on the surface is subject to a noncubic crystalline electric field and this provides an additional source of anisotropy effecting the superparamagnetic behavior . in this lower symmetry crystal field environment ,",
    "a low - spin configuration is energetically favorable resulting in a moment of @xmath21 on the surface mn atoms .",
    "unfortunately , the neutron scattering data here can not contribute significantly to the discussion concerning the nature of the surface spins . the diffuse magnetic scattering in the polarized neutron scattering data ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) shows a weak magnetic diffuse component that suggests the presence of disordered spins , but we stress though that the measurement itself provides no information whether or not these spins are on the surface .",
    "moreover , if there were significant ferromagnetic moments we would expect depolarization of the neutron beam .",
    "no obvious depolarization of the neutron beam was observed , but it is difficult make a quantitative estimate on a limit of the a ferromagnetic moment size without further systematic measurements .",

    "suppression of @xmath0 is also observed in ultrafine mno particles @xcite as well as in other nanoscale afm compounds such as nio and coo thin films,@xcite and nio disc shaped nanoparticles.@xcite a mean field approach with finite size effects for the magnetic transition has been used for the explanation of the suppression of @xmath0 . in this theory ,",
    "the transition temperature is suppressed when the sample size / thickness decreases to small value . for mno a prism model of ultrafine particles ,",
    "the calculations predict @xmath0 will be suppressed at small size due to the decrease of the average coupling constant which is induced by the decrease of coordination number on the surface.@xcite similar arguments are likely to apply to the nanoparticles studied here and thus @xmath0 suppression is likely due to decreases in the coordination number and the average coupling constant . in sample b , @xmath0 remains the same as bulk material suggesting that size confinement effects in mno nanoparticles appear at only relatively small sizes . in apparent contradiction to the preceding arguments , an enhanced @xmath0 is reported in confined geometry nanoparticles.@xcite for these nanoparticle systems the worm - like particle morphology@xcite and the surface interface of glass@xcite or another magnetic species@xcite is the likely cause of the differences in behavior with those studied here .",
    "as mentioned above , the coordination number on the surface affects the transition temperature and by adjusting the coordination number t@xmath22 can be increased or decreased.@xcite    the effect of size confinement on the order of the magnetic / structural phase transition is another interesting issue in nanoscale mno .",
    "it has been suggested in the confined geometry mno nanoparticles that the afm transition is a continuous phase transition.@xcite in these samples the critical exponent @xmath23 describing the ordered magnetic moment , m(t ) @xmath8 ( 1-@xmath24)@xmath25 , ranges from 0.3 up to almost the mean field value of 0.5 .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with monte carlo simulations for the finite size ising model and heisenberg model where @xmath23 is 0.3258 and 0.3616 , respectively.@xcite in the reduced temperature range of 1-@xmath26/@xmath0= 0.02 - 0.5 , fitting our temperature dependent moment to a power law of ( 1-@xmath26/@xmath0)@xmath27 yields a much smaller @xmath23 of 0.24@xmath10.02 for sample a and 0.22@xmath10.02 for sample b. this could be interpreted as lower dimensional critical behavior but is more likely the result of a discontinuous phase transition .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied two different sizes of monodisperse mno nanoparticles using unpolarized and polarized neutron diffraction . both the magnetic and crystal structure are similar to the bulk , but with substantially reduced average magnetic moment .",
    "moreover , the results show that in the 8 nm sample the antiferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath0 is suppressed while in the 13 nm sample , @xmath0 is comparable to bulk .",
    "the suppression of @xmath0 is attributed to the exchange coupling reduction induced by the finite size effect .",
