    "the direct algebraic method is the use of the first order polynomial differential equation , which solutions are elementary or elliptic functions , to transform the initial differential system in a nonlinear algebraic system in coefficients of this first order equation and parameters of the initial system .",
    "it has been proved that any finite system of algebraic equations can be solved by the grbner ( groebner ) basis method  @xcite , but calculations for a sufficiently complex algebraic system can be very difficult and expensive . in this paper",

    "<S> the painlev test is very useful to construct not only the laurent series solutions of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations but also the elliptic and trigonometric ones . </S>",
    "<S> the standard methods for constructing the elliptic solutions consist of two independent steps : transformation of a nonlinear polynomial differential equation into a nonlinear algebraic system and a search for solutions of the obtained system . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated by the example of the generalized hnon  </S>",
    "<S> heiles system that the use of the laurent series solutions of the initial differential equation assists to solve the obtained algebraic system . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure has been automatized and generalized on some type of multivalued solutions . to find solutions of the initial differential equation in the form of the laurent or puiseux series we use the painlev test . </S>",
    "<S> this test can also assist to solve the inverse problem : to find the form of a polynomial potential , which corresponds to the required type of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the five  dimensional gravitational model with a scalar field to demonstrate this .    </S>",
