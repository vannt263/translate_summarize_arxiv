    "dynamical processes evolving on complex networks are of current interest of research @xcite . in networks with large topological dimension defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes within the ( chemical ) distance @xmath2 , the dynamics is expected to be exponentially fast . however , there are observations showing the appearance of generically slow time evolution .",
    "for example in working memory of the brain @xcite or in recovery processes following a virus pandemic @xcite power - law type of time dependencies have been found , resembling of dynamical critical phenomena @xcite . in social networks",
    "the occurrence of generic slow dynamics was suggested to be the result of bursty behavior of agents connected by small world networks @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is related to the emergence of arbitrarily large , rare - regions ( rr ) that can change their state exponentially slowly as the function of their sizes .",
    "near phase transitions from active to inactive states in disordered system @xcite a so called griffiths phase ( gp ) @xcite can develop , characterized by non - universal , power - law dynamics .",
    "griffiths singularities affect the dynamical behavior both below and above the transition point and can be best described via renormalization group methods in networks @xcite .",
    "it has been been conjectured @xcite that such slow dynamics can occur only in finite dimensional networks as the consequence of heterogeneity : explicit reaction or purely topological disorder .",
    "this is based on optimal fluctuation theory and simulations of the contact process ( cp ) @xcite on erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite and on generalized small world networks @xcite . in case of networks with infinite topological dimension , like the barabsi - albert ( ba)@xcite graph slow dynamics",
    "has be found only in tree networks and weighting schemes , that suppress the information propagation among hubs @xcite .",
    "the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model @xcite is another fundamental system to describe simple epidemic ( information ) possessing binary site variables : infected / active or healthy / inactive .",
    "infected sites propagate the epidemic ( or active ) all of their neighbors with rate @xmath3 or recover ( spontaneously deactivate ) with rate @xmath4 .",
    "sis differs from the cp in which the branching rate is normalized by @xmath5 , the number of outgoing edges of a vertex , thus it allows an analytic treatment , using symmetric matrices . by decreasing the infection rate of the neighbors",
    "a continuous phase transition occurs at some @xmath6 critical point from a state with finite activity density @xmath7 to and inactive steady state with @xmath8 .",
    "the latter is also called absorbing , because no spontaneous activation of sites is allowed . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a dissortative weighing scheme of the edges @xmath9 can effectively slow down the information propagation in sis model and result in long living rare regions , causing slow dynamics .",
    "heterogeneous mean field ( hmf ) theory represents an exact result in annealed networks and provides a good approximation in networks with high @xmath10 , when the dynamical fluctuations are irrelevant @xcite . to describe quenched heterogeneity of the network the so - called quenched mean - field ( qmf ) approximation",
    "is introduced @xcite .",
    "in @xcite i compared density decay simulation results of the sis model with the qmf approximations . here",
    "i show further evidences for the agreement of qmf and dynamical simulations in case of certain er and ba graphs .",
    "in particular , i investigate the prediction of qmf for the interaction weight scheme of @xcite applied for er graphs .",
    "this kind of disorder on interactions is important , because face - to - face experiments @xcite resulted in such distribution of connect intensities that can be modeled with it . in @xcite",
    "@xmath5 dependent weights were applied on the edges , while in @xcite the infection probability of nodes were reduced to slow down the fast epidemic spreading in small world networks .",
    "now i apply qmf for @xmath5 independent weights , distributed and frozen on the graph edges before the start of the epidemic process .    in the original ba graph construction one",
    "starts from a single connected node and add new links with the linear preferential rule .",
    "this causes initial nodes with high connectivity and those are attached at step @xmath11 will have a vanishing average degree @xmath12 . in various network studies , like article citations @xcite and model calculations the degradation of connection capability of aging nodes have been analyzed .",
    "it is well known that in neural networks this happens indeed . in this paper",
    "i investigate a generalized model , in which fraction of edges of the aging nodes are removed by a random , linear preferential rule @xcite . in this case",
    "the edge distribution of the ba graph @xmath13 will be cut off by an exponential factor for large @xmath5-s and the qmf suggests gp behavior in agreement with the dynamical simulations .",
    "a mean - field theory of the sis model @xcite , capable of taking into account the topological heterogeneity in a network of size @xmath1 is based on the rate equation of @xmath14 , the infection probability of node @xmath11 at time @xmath15 : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is an element of the adjacency matrix assigned with @xmath4 , if there is an edge between nodes @xmath11 and @xmath18 or @xmath19 otherwise and @xmath20 describes the possibility of weights attributed to the edges . for large times",
    "the sis model evolves into a steady state , with and order parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this equation with symmetric weights under the exchange of @xmath22 can be treated by a spectral decomposition ( sd ) on an orthonormal eigenvector basis .",
    "furthermore the non - negativity of the @xmath23 matrix involves a unique , real , non - negative largest eigenvalue @xmath24 . in the qmf approximation",
    "one can find @xmath6 and @xmath25 around it by taking into account the principal eigenvector only .",
    "using the linear superposition expansion of @xmath7 one can solve eq .",
    "( [ qmfsis ] ) , which provides @xmath26 , i.e. a stable @xmath27 ( active ) solution for @xmath28 and an inactive one for @xmath29 .",
    "the order parameter near , above @xmath6 can be approximated via @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the coefficients @xmath32 \\ , \\label{epsilon}\\ ] ] are functions of eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalues .",
    "this expression is exact if there is a gap between @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite and tested on weighted ba models @xcite that the localization of activity in the active steady state can be characterized by the inverse participation ratio ( @xmath35 ) , related to the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue @xmath36 as @xmath37 this quantity remains small : @xmath38 in case of homogeneous eigenvector components and takes the maximal value @xmath4 if all activity is concentrated on a single node .",
    "i used the sparse matrix package octave @xcite for generating and diagonalizing @xmath39 and calculating @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 for network sizes up to @xmath43 . in the numerical analysis i extrapolated and fitted the @xmath40 data assuming a power - law form @xmath44 containing the free parameters : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it was derived by @xcite , that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath17 of general random graphs is determined by the maximum degree @xmath47 @xmath48 where the @xmath49 term tends to zero as the limiting values @xmath50 diverge to infinity .    for the classical , random er graph case , with finite connection probability : @xmath51 we have @xmath52 , therefore @xmath53 although in the @xmath54 limit the first term dominates the maximum and predicts a divergence @xmath55 this function grows so slowly , that even for extremely large sizes : @xmath56 and practically one observes a constant value .",
    "thus , for @xmath57 and for @xmath58 graphs considered here the largest eigenvalue seems to tend to the finite value @xmath59 in agreement with the hmf theoretical value @xcite : @xmath60 and with recent simulation results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the random , unweighted sf networks , with power - law degree distribution @xmath13 the largest eigenvalue diverges and follows the finite size scaling law @xmath61 deduced in @xcite .",
    "generally , in the numerical analysis of the qmf results least - squares fitting with the simple power - law form @xmath62 was applied , but in the er case the logarithmic convergence of the largest eigenvalue ( [ l11scal ] ) has been tested .",
    "simulations of the sis model were performed in such a way that in a given time step either a deactivation at site @xmath11 , with probability : @xmath63 or activation of all neighboring inactive sites with probabilities : @xmath64 were attempted . here",
    "@xmath65 is the number of neighboring , inactive sites , which was computed when the node @xmath11 was selected randomly .",
    "these reaction steps were iterated @xmath66 times , where @xmath66 is the number of active sites at time @xmath15 . following this system update , which selects each node once in average the time was incremented by @xmath67 monte carlo step ( msc ) . throughout the paper the time is measured by mcs . the density of active sites @xmath68 was calculated and stored at exponentially growing time steps : @xmath69 .",
    "the system was initialized from a fully active state and the graph updates were repeated until @xmath70 or in case of extinction of activity .",
    "the maximum simulation time depends on the system size , ranging from @xmath71 for @xmath72 to @xmath73 for @xmath74 . to obtain good statistics",
    "the simulations have been repeated for @xmath75 independent graph realizations and @xmath68 averaged over them .    to explore in more detail the decay of the density functions ,",
    "i have computed effective decay exponents of the power - laws @xmath76 , defined as the local slopes @xmath77 }     { \\ln(t / t^{\\prime } ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath78 was chosen in such a way that the discrete approximate of the derivative is sufficiently smooth .",

    "it has been conjectured @xcite that in this case the epidemic spreading is too fast to let the formation of active rrs of size @xmath81 with the lifetime : @xmath82 , hence gp can not occur .",

    "it was also hypothesized @xcite and shown by simulations of the cp @xcite , that in the fragmented phase strong rare - region effects and gp dynamics can be observed .",

    "<S> the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model is one of the simplest memoryless system for describing information / epidemic spreading phenomena with competing creation and spontaneous annihilation reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of quenched disorder on the dynamical behavior has recently been compared to quenched mean - field ( qmf ) approximations in scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> qmf can take into account topological heterogeneity and clustering effects of the activity in the steady state by spectral decomposition analysis of the adjacency matrix . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it can provide predictions on possible rare - region effects , thus on the occurrence of slow dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> i compare qmf results of sis with simulations on various large dimensional graphs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , i show that for erds - rnyi graphs this method predicts correctly the epidemic threshold and the rare - region effects . </S>",
    "<S> griffiths phases emerge if the graph is fragmented or if we apply strong , exponentially suppressing weighting scheme on the edges . </S>",
    "<S> the latter model describes the connection time distributions in the face - to - face experiments . in case of generalized barabsi - albert type of networks with aging connections strong rare - region effects and numerical evidence for griffiths phase dynamics </S>",
