    "for many spintronics applications it is not the bulk , but the surface or interface electronic structure at the fermi energy given by the difference of the normalized total number of spin up and spin down electrons of the involved materials , which is relevant for applications .",
    "however , theoretical predictions for this sample region are much more demanding compared with calculations of bulk properties .",
    "a key property for spintronics is the spin polarization at the fermi level .",
    "concerning surface and interface states it is necessary to distinguish between materials with a finite total spin polarization at the fermi energy and materials with zero total but momentum dependent spin polarization , which is nonzero for specific k values .",
    "examples for the second class of materials are topological insulators like bi@xmath0se@xmath2 @xcite , but also simple materials like bismuth @xcite and tungsten @xcite .",
    "however , the first class of materials , i.e. with a nonzero total spin polarization , can be realized by ferro- or ferrimagnetic materials only .",
    "accordingly , in the following the term spin polarization is always used for the total spin polarization at the fermi energy . by surface sensitive",
    "spin and angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( sr - arpes ) values of the spin polarization close to 100@xmath1 at room temperature were observed for metastable cro@xmath0 @xcite and for fe@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , but no corresponding state - of - the - art photoemission calculation and no discussion of possible surface states exists up to now .",
    "furthermore , these materials did not allow for large spin transport effects and are not compatible with other materials relevant for applications .",
    "for these reasons intermetallic heusler compounds @xcite with their predicted half - metallic properties @xcite moved into the focus of interest @xcite .",
    "in addition to being interesting for applications , intermetallic heusler materials represent a test for modern electronic structure calculations for materials with electronic correlations of moderate strength @xcite .",
    "in fact , by means of various band structure methods many heusler compounds have been predicted to be 100@xmath1 spin - polarized in the bulk .",
    "however , the first direct observation of a huge surface spin polarization in any heusler compound by photoemission spectroscopy was possible only very recently @xcite . in our preliminary work we identified a 93@xmath1 polarized surface resonance investigating the heusler compound co@xmath0mnsi at room temperature .",
    "this represents the first example for such a resonance in any ferromagnetic metal . within this work",
    "we investigate in more detail the occupied as well as the unoccupied electronic structure of co@xmath0mnsi .",
    "furthermore , we compare our spectroscopical analysis to corresponding experimental data , with special emphasis on surface - related features of the electronic structure .",
    "experimentally , the interesting valence band region around the fermi energy is accessible by means of ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) @xcite and inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ipe ) @xcite . from the theoretical point of view the most successful theoretical approach to deal with photoemission",
    "is the so - called one - step model as originally proposed by pendry and co - workers @xcite .",
    "a review on the various developments and refinements @xcite of the approach can be found in ref .  .",
    "as the most recent development our spectroscopic analysis is based on the fully relativistic one - step model , in its spin - density matrix formulation .",
    "this approach allows describing properly the complete spin - polarization vector of the photo current .",
    "the corresponding spin - density matrix of the photocurrent is defined by the following equation @xcite : @xmath4 it follows then for the spin - density matrix @xmath5 : @xmath6 the intensity of the photocurrent results in : @xmath7 and the corresponding spin - polarization vector is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the vector of the three pauli spin matrices .",
    "finally , the spin - projected photocurrent is obtained from the following equation : @xmath10 the spin polarization is calculated with respect to the vector * n*. this , for example , allows the complete calculation of all three components of the spin - polarization vector for each pair of ( k@xmath11,k@xmath12 ) values which define the coordinate system for momentum images . within this formalism i@xmath13 denotes the elastic part of the photocurrent .",
    "vertex renormalizations are neglected .",
    "this excludes inelastic energy losses and corresponding quantum - mechanical interference terms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the rest system is not accounted for , which means that the so - called sudden approximation has been applied .",
    "this approximation is expected to be justified for not too small photon energies .",
    "the initial and final states are constructed within spin - polarized low - energy electron diffraction ( spleed ) theory where the final state is represented by a so - called time - reversed spleed state @xcite .",
    "many - body effects are included phenomenologically in the final - state calculation , using a parameterized , weakly energy - dependent and complex inner potential as in ref .  .",
    "this generalized inner potential accounts for inelastic corrections to the elastic photocurrent @xcite as well as the actual ( real ) inner potential , which serves as a reference energy inside the solid with respect to the vacuum level @xcite . due to the finite imaginary part ,",
    "the inelastic mean free path ( imfp ) is accounted for and thus the amplitude of the high - energy photoelectron state can be neglected beyond a certain distance from the surface .",
    "the self - consistent electronic structure calculations were performed within the ab - initio framework of spin - density functional theory , in a fully relativistic mode by solving the corresponding dirac equation . for the exchange and correlation potential the perdew - burke - enzerhof parametrization",
    "was used @xcite . to account for electronic correlations beyond the local spin - density approximation ( lsda )",
    "we employed a self - consistent combination of the lsda and the dynamical mean field theory .",
    "this computational lsda+dmft scheme , self - consistent in both the self - energy calculation and the charge - density calculation is implemented within the relativistic spr - kkr formalism @xcite .",
    "the effective dmft impurity problem was solved through the spin polarized t - matrix fluctuation - exchange ( sptf ) solver @xcite , working on a matsubara energy grid corresponding to a temperature of 400 k. the sptf solver is accurate for moderately correlated systems as it was shown in several successful applications for various materials @xcite .",
    "simultaneous convergence of the electronic charge - density and the self - energy had been achieved by use of 4096 matsubara frequencies .",
    "the double counting was corrected using the fully localised limit ( fll ) scheme ( for details concerning dc corrections within kkr calculations see @xcite ) .",
    "the ffl was succesfully applied to co@xmath0mnsi recently within lsda+u calculations @xcite , where we used the fully rotationally invariant u - matrix with u - parameters u@xmath14=3.0 ev and u@xmath15=1.5 ev for mn and co. the exchange parameter @xmath16 was chosen to 0.9 ev for both mn and co.    additionally , for the photoemission calculations , we account for the surface barrier by use of a rundgren - malmstrm - type surface potential @xcite , which can be easily included into the formalism as an additional layer .",
    "this procedure allows for the correct description of its asymptotic behavior . as this surface barrier represents a z - dependent potential , a surface contribution as part of the total photocurrent results , which accounts explicitly for the energetics and dispersion of all surface features .",
    "furthermore , the relative intensities of surface - related spectral distributions are quantitatively accounted for by calculating the corresponding matrix elements in the surface region .",
    "this procedure is described in detail , for example , in refs .  . also ,",
    "energy and momentum conservation are naturally included in the formalism @xcite . to take care of impurity scattering ,",
    "a small constant imaginary value of v@xmath17 = 0.05 ev was used for the initial state , this way describing the finite life - time of the initial state .",
    "life - time effects in the final state are accounted for by the imaginary part of the inner potential ( see above ) . a constant imaginary value of v@xmath18 = 1.5 ev has been chosen again in a phenomenological way for excitation energies in the arpes regime .",
    "according to the experimental setup the spectroscopic calculations were performed for linearly p - polarized light .",
    "the high reactivity of heusler materials makes photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) , the most powerful method for investigations of the electronic band structure of solids , challenging .",
    "sample degradation is a major problem and often results in missing fermi edges in the photoemission spectra and unexpectedly small experimentally obtained spin polarizations , such as 12@xmath1 for the predicted half - metal co@xmath0mnsi @xcite .",
    "sputter cleaning of the samples prior to pes yields slightly increased spin polarization values , for instance 20@xmath1 for co@xmath0cr@xmath19fe@xmath20al @xcite .",
    "however , in these and many other cases neither the observed spin polarization nor the overall energy dependence of the total intensity resembles the results of band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "generally three issues result in poor agreement of theory with experiment : imperfect surface preparation often leads to disorder , aging of the sample results in surface oxidation , and the discrepancies with calculated spectra may arise from shortcomings of the calculations themselves , e.g. the neglect of surface states .",
    "however , calculations of surface states of non - stoichiometric co@xmath0mnsi(100 ) thin films are available @xcite , which were used to explain the low spin polarization of about 20@xmath1 measured by ups ( h@xmath21=5.9 ev ) on ex - situ prepared and in - situ sputter cleaned co@xmath0mn@xmath22si@xmath23 thin films .",
    "fetzer et al .",
    "@xcite published experiments of ex - situ prepared stoichiometric co@xmath0mnsi(100 ) capped by 20 monolayers of mgo through which they obtained spin resolved ups data ( h@xmath21=5.9 ev ) .",
    "they identified no interface states , which they attributed to defects at the co@xmath0mnsi / mgo interface .",
    "a spin polarization of about 40@xmath1 was obtained .",
    "another way to avoid spurious photoemission results due to degraded sample surfaces is the use of less surface - sensitive hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( haxpes ) .",
    "the identification of several experimentally obtained intensity features with the density of states ( dos ) was possible for materials like niti@xmath24sc@xmath25sn , nimnsb or co@xmath26mn@xmath27ge@xmath28 ( x : z = 2 : 0.38 ) thin heusler films @xcite . however , due to the low intensities of haxpes experiments no spin resolved results are available up to now .",
    "we demonstrated that by in - situ ups with highly efficient spin - filtering @xcite on epitaxial heusler thin films the problem of surface degradation can be solved and a spin polarization of 55@xmath1 investigating co@xmath0mnga could be obtained @xcite .",

    "the co@xmath0mnsi - films are magnetized in - plane along the @xmath29-@xmath30 line of the surface brillouin zone .",
    "however , we have calculated additionally the bulk - band dispersions for a magnetization direction perpendicular to the surface to demonstrate that the dispersion strongly depends on the magnetization direction . this behavior results from the interplay between spin - orbit - coupling ( soc ) and magnetic exchange interaction and depends on the band symmetry @xcite . here , the magnetization direction perpendicular to the surface is indicated by black color and the in - plane direction as given from the experimental conditions is marked by green ( light ) color .",
    "as the underlying symmetry is different for these two cases the spin - orbit coupling causes pronounced changes in the dispersion and energetic position of nearly all bands , if the magnetization is switched from in - plane to out - of - plane direction .",
    "the corresponding energy - band splittings and hybridization gaps typically range from some mev up to about 100  mev . in contrast the calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( mae ) , which is defined as the energy difference between @xmath31e@xmath32 = e@xmath33}$]-e@xmath34}$ ] of bulk co@xmath0mnsi results to @xmath31e@xmath32 = 0.4 @xmath35ev",
    ". this should be expected for bulk co@xmath0mnsi due its cubic structure .",
    "the reason for the different energy scales appearing here is found in the fact that the soc - split energy - band regions only contribute to the mae if they are located in the vicinity of the fermi level , where they induce significant deformations of the fermi surface as a consequense they do not contribute to the mae if they appear at finite binding energies . note that similar effects can be observed for a magnetization which is directed parallel to the ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) crystallographic axis .",
    "the energetic difference vanishes for the bulk system because these two axis are equivalent . in this case",
    "the electronic band structure is invariant under rotations of the quantization axis together with the magnetization direction @xcite . as discussed before",
    ", this means that all these modifications cancel each other after integration over all occupied states and do not contribute ( as in the cases of ( 100 ) and ( 001 ) directions ) or only create very small contributions ( in the present case of ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) directions ) to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "one should expect that also surface - related features of the electronic structure will be significantly influenced if the magnetization direction changes .",

    "first , one may observe that for all photon energies the spin polarization reaches nearly 100@xmath1 in the vicinity of the fermi level .",

    "the spin polarization at the fermi level is reduced to values significantly smaller than the pure bulk value .",
    "the origin for this peculiar behavior is found in the very different electronic structures , which result for in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization directions of the sample surface .",

    "it remains to remind to the fact that our self - consistent electronic structure calculation leads to a half - metallic band structure with a total gap located around e@xmath37 in the minority spin - projected states .",

    "6 , the inclusion of the complete surface - related photoexcitation in the ups calculation results in nearly perfect agreement with experiment .",
    "if the surface resonance were not present , half - metallic behavior would persist , but the finite experimental resolution in photoemission would hinder the observation of a high spin polarization . as mentioned before , the theoretical analysis reveals an experimental resolution limited spin polarization lower than 50@xmath1 for a pure bulk - like calculation .",

    "if one compares first the pure bulk - like theoretical spectrum with the calculated dos the correspondence between these two intensity distributions is obvious .",

    "a well known example for such a surface feature is the shockley state dispersing on the cu(111)-surface @xcite .",

    "<S> the magnitude of the spin polarization at the fermi level of ferromagnetic materials at room temperature is a key property for spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> investigating the heusler compound co@xmath0mnsi a value of 93@xmath1 for the spin polarization has been observed at room temperature , where the high spin polarization is related to a stable surface resonance in the majority band extending deep into the bulk . in particular , we identified in our spectroscopical analysis that this surface resonance is embedded in the bulk continuum with a strong coupling to the majority bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance behaves very bulk - like , as it extends over the first six atomic layers of the corresponding ( 001)-surface . </S>",
    "<S> our study includes experimental investigations , where the bulk electronic structure as well as surface - related features have been investigated using spin - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( sr - ups ) and for a larger probing depth spin - integrated high energy x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( haxpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are interpreted in comparison with first - principles band structure and photoemission calculations which consider all relativistic , surface and high - energy effects properly . </S>"
