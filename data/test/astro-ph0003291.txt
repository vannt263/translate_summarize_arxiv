    "activity is an important parameter in the study of stellar populations .",
    "numerous investigations of late - type ( f - m ) stars have shown correlations between emission ( e.g. , ca ii h & k , mg ii h & k , balmer series , etc . ) and fundamental parameters such as age , rotation , and metallicity @xcite . it is generally believed that the majority of this optical emission occurs in the chromosphere via collisional heating by ions and electrons along magnetic field lines . indeed , this hypothesis is supported by the observed correlation of activity and rotation in late - type stars @xcite , which is expected if magnetic fields are generated by an internal dynamo ( e.g.  @xmath0-@xmath7 dynamo ; parker 1955 ) .",
    "decrease in activity as stars age can be attributed to spin - down due to angular momentum loss in stellar winds @xcite .",
    "as we examine cooler m and l dwarfs , however , these relations begin to break down . as stars become fully convective ( @xmath5 0.3 m@xmath8 ) , the @xmath0-@xmath7 dynamo mechanism becomes ineffective , as it requires a low - buoyancy , radiative / convective boundary to anchor flux lines @xcite .",
    "however , the observed activity level remains roughly constant around this transition point @xcite , suggesting a turbulent dynamo as an alternate magnetic field source @xcite .",
    "indeed , flaring activity , which is magnetically driven , is seen in objects as late as m9.5 @xcite , supporting the existence of substantial magnetic fields beyond the convective cut - off . alternately , acoustic heating could sufficiently heat the chromosphere @xcite to produce a `` basal flux '' of h@xmath0 emission . in either case ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the fraction of objects with measurable emission rises to 100% at spectral type m7 , then rapidly declines , so that no emission is seen in types l5 or later @xcite .",
    "the decrease in ( steady ) activity even encompasses objects with rapid rotation @xcite , at odds with trends in hotter stars .",
    "whether this drop in emission is due to ineffective chromospheric heating , decreased magnetic activity , or some other mechanism is unclear , but the end of the main sequence appears to mark a change in activity .    based on the results of @xcite , we would not expect significant activity in t dwarfs , brown dwarfs that show ch@xmath9 absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we have observed h@xmath0 in emission in the t dwarf 2massw j1237392 + 652615 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* herefter 2mass j1237 + 65 ) , identified from the two micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "we describe the optical observations of this and two other t dwarfs in @xmath112 ; in @xmath113 we discuss the h@xmath0 detection in 2mass j1237 + 65 and possible emission mechanisms ; in @xmath114 we compare 2mass j1237 + 65 to the unusual m9.5ve pc 0025 + 0447 ; we summarize our results in @xmath115 .",
    "2mass j1237 + 65 was observed on three consecutive nights , 1999 july 16 , 17 , and 18 ( ut ) using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lris ) on the keck ii 10-meter telescope . on each occasion , conditions were transparent with seeing of 0@xmath128 to 1@xmath120 , and we employed a 1@xmath13 wide slit . the target was acquired via blind offset from field stars , as it was invisible in the guiding imager .",
    "the july 16 and 17 observations were made using the 400 lines mm@xmath14 grating blazed at 8500  , covering the wavelength range 6300 to 10100  at 9  resolution .",
    "total integrations of 4800 ( 1800 + 1800 + 1200 ) and 1800 s were obtained , respectively .",
    "the july 17 observation was plagued by poor target centering , reducing the observed flux by a factor of @xmath5 2 ; the data for this night are thus omitted , although h@xmath0 was detected .",
    "the july 18 observation was an 1800 s exposure using the 300 lines mm@xmath14 grating blazed at 5000  , covering 3800 to 8600  at 12  resolution .",
    "additional 3600 and 2700 s observations ( total integration time ) of t dwarfs sdssp j162414.37 + 002915.6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss 1624 + 00 ) and sdssp j134646.45 - 003150.4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss 1346 - 00 ) were made on july 16 and 17 , using the 400 lines mm@xmath14 grating blazed at 8500  .",
    "the data for all three objects were reduced and calibrated using standard iraf routines .",
    "a one - second dark exposure was used to remove the bias , and quartz - lamp flat - field exposures were used to normalize the response of the detector .",
    "the individual spectra were extracted using the apextract routine , allowing for slight curvature of the point - source dispersion line viewed through the lris optics . due to the low flux levels of the t dwarf targets",
    ", we used an extraction template derived from observations of standard stars .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using hg - ne - ar arc lamp exposures taken after each object exposure . finally , the spectra were flux calibrated using observations of the dc white dwarf standard ltt 9491 @xcite .",
    "data have not been corrected for telluric absorption , so the atmospheric h@xmath15o bands at 8161 - 8282 , 8950 - 9300 , and 9300 - 9650  are still present in the spectra ( telluric h@xmath15o and o@xmath15 bands are not visible shortward of 8000  due to low flux levels ) .",
    "spectra from 6300 - 10100  for all three objects are shown in figure 1 .",
    "data blueward of 6300  are not shown , as our july 18 observations failed to detect any flux , continuum or emission , in this regime .",
    "features identified by @xcite in gl 229b are indicated .",
    "the optical spectrum of sdss 1624 + 00 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "cs i lines at 8521 and 8944  are seen strongly in sdss 1624 + 00 , while both sdss 1346 - 00 and 2mass j1237 + 65",
    "have progressively weaker lines . broadened h@xmath15o at 9250  and a weak ch@xmath9 feature centered near 8950  are noted , both of which are stronger in 2mass j1237 + 65 and sdss",
    "1346 - 00 than in sdss 1624 + 00 .",
    "the pressure - broadened resonant k i doublet at 7665 and 7699  , which is prominent in the spectra of l dwarfs @xcite , is masking most of the flux between 7300 and 8100  in all three objects @xcite .",
    "we note a feature in sdss 1624 + 00 centered around 9900  which we identify as the 9896  0 - 0 a@xmath16@xmath17-x@xmath16@xmath17 band of feh , a feature that weakens from l6v and later @xcite .",
    "this detection supports the claims of @xcite and @xcite that sdss 1624 + 00 is probably warmer than gl 229b , which shows no feh band .",
    "hydride bands in sdss 1346 - 00 and 2mass j1237 + 65 are either weak or absent , suggesting that they in turn are cooler than sdss 1624 + 00 . the remaining feature of interest , h@xmath0 emission at 6563  in 2mass j1237 + 65 , is the subject of the remainder of this article .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission seen in 2mass j1237 + 65 ( figure 2 ) is quite unexpected given the cool nature of this object , and great care was taken to verify its presence over three nights of observation .",
    "the emission spike was clearly seen in the raw data and is not spatially extended , thus ruling out the possibility of a background hi region or telluric emission .",
    "h@xmath0 emission was detected in five observations , spanning three nights and two different instrument settings , with the emission full - width at half - maximum equivalent to the instrumental resolution ( @xmath5 5 pixels ) .",
    "hence , we can rule out the possibility of a chance cosmic ray .",
    "finally , since no emission at 6563  is seen for the other t dwarfs , which were reduced using the same bias and flat - field exposures , we can rule out detector features .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line is thus quite real .",
    "measurements of the h@xmath0 line for all three t dwarfs are given in table 1 .",
    "the integrated line luminosity at 6563  averaged over the three july 16 observations is @xmath18 = ( 6.6@xmath190.6 ) @xmath20 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 .",
    "an equivalent width measurement is not possible as no continuum flux was detected in this spectral region .",
    "note that there appears to be an increase in h@xmath0 flux on july 18 to @xmath18 = ( 8.5@xmath190.3 ) @xmath20 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 .",
    "we estimate the bolometric flux of 2mass j1237 + 65 using the 2mass j - band magnitude of 15.90@xmath190.06 and assuming a gl 229b bolometric correction of bc@xmath23 = 2.3 @xcite .",
    "this yields m@xmath2 = 18.2 and f@xmath2 @xmath24 1.3 @xmath20 10@xmath25 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 ; thus , log(@xmath18/@xmath26 ) = log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) @xmath24 @xmath34.3 .",
    "a limit on h@xmath27 emission at 4861  is estimated at @xmath28 @xmath29 2.0 @xmath20 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 , resulting in a balmer emission ratio on 1999 july 18 ( ut ) of @xmath28/@xmath18 @xmath29 0.24 .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0 is clearly inconsistent with the emission trend seen in objects later than l5v and indeed in brown dwarfs in general @xcite .",
    "the level of activity for 2mass j1237 + 65 can be placed in context with other late - type emission - line objects by comparing relative flux emitted through the h@xmath0 line .",
    "@xcite find a mean log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) @xmath24 @xmath33.8 for field dme stars with m@xmath2 @xmath30 12 ( spectral type m5v or earlier ) , while @xcite show that this falls to below @xmath35 for l dwarfs .",
    "hence , even the activity level of 2mass j1237 + 65 is inconsistent with these trends , while sdss 1346 - 00 and sdss 1624",
    "+ 00 have upper limits of log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) @xmath24 @xmath35.3 and @xmath35.7 , respectively .",
    "does 2mass j1237 + 65 have an unusually strong magnetic field , perhaps powered by a dynamo mechanism different than that of m and l dwarfs ?",
    "further examination of activity statistics in this cool regime are clearly needed .",
    "while sustained activity may appear to diminish toward later spectral types , flaring does not .",
    "a good example of this is bri 0021 - 0214 , a rapid m9.5v rotator @xcite which in quiescence shows little or no h@xmath0 emission @xcite , yet was seen to flare by @xcite with log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) = @xmath34.2 , similar to 2mass j1237 + 65 .",
    "the bri 0021 - 0214 flare also showed no continuum emission , again similar to the activity in 2mass j1237 + 65 .",
    "while flaring has not yet been observed in l dwarfs , the occurrence of flares in the latest m dwarfs @xcite suggests that they may simply have not yet been observed .",
    "however , most strong m - dwarf flares persist only a few hours @xcite , while smaller flares ( which would show weaker continuum emission ) have timescales on the order of minutes @xcite .",
    "thus , prolonged emission of 2mass j1237 + 65 requires either a continuous flaring mechanism or fortuitous timing on our part .",
    "further observations of the emission line are warranted to investigate more fully the temporal behavior of this emission .",
    "@xcite first pointed out that a minimum `` basal flux '' seen in late - type stars could be attributed to chromospheric heating from acoustic waves .",
    "we can estimate the amount of acoustic flux from 2mass j1237 + 65 by extrapolating the models of @xcite , which improved on pivotal work done by @xcite .",
    "estimating t@xmath31 @xmath24 1000 k , log g(cm s@xmath32 ) @xmath24 5 , and using the scaling f@xmath33",
    "@xmath5 t@xmath31@xmath34 from the coolest points in their table 1 , we estimate f@xmath33 @xmath24 4 @xmath20 10@xmath35 erg @xmath22 s@xmath14 , or log(l@xmath33/l@xmath2 ) @xmath24 @xmath315 , well below the observed activity level . as such , acoustic energy is not likely the source of activity in 2mass j1237 + 65 .      finally , it is possible that 2mass j1237 + 65 is active as a result of a binary interaction with an equal magnitude or fainter companion .",
    "the binarity of brown dwarfs is well established , @xcite , and the identification of three equal magnitude binaries in an l dwarf sample of ten by @xcite is consistent with the binary fraction seen in late main sequence stars ( @xmath5 35% ; fischer & marcy 1992 ; henry & mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to consider that 2mass j1237 + 65 could itself be double . in this case",
    ", the companion would have to be equal - mass or smaller , as the optical continuum shows no evidence of a warmer component nor any significant variation over three days .",
    "an unusual feature of brown dwarf binaries is the possibility of sustained roche lobe overflow . because of its degenerate interior , if a brown dwarf loses mass on a dynamical timescale ( @xmath36 @xmath5 ( @xmath37 @xmath5 1 hr ) , its radius increases approximately as dlnr / dlnm @xmath24 -@xmath38 when its mass lies in the range 5 - 70 m@xmath6 = 1.9 @xmath20 10@xmath39 g = 0.00095 m@xmath8 , r@xmath6 = 7.1 @xmath20 10@xmath40 cm = 0.10 r@xmath8 @xcite . ]",
    "sustained conservative mass transfer then occurs if the change in the roche lobe of the secondary satisfies    @xmath41    we have taken @xmath42 = @xmath43 as the mass fraction , @xmath44 and @xmath45 the primary and secondary masses , and @xmath46 the secondary roche lobe radius , as approximated by @xcite    @xmath47    here @xmath4 is the binary separation . equation ( 1 ) is satisfied when @xmath42 @xmath30 0.63 .",
    "we have calculated possible brown dwarf binary separations , periods , and edge - on primary radial velocities as a function of @xmath42 ( figure 3 ) for primary masses @xmath44 = 30 and 70 m@xmath6 and @xcite    @xmath48    m@xmath49 and r@xmath49 are the mass and radius of the secondary in units normalized to jupiter .",
    "this rough model shows that sustained outflow requires a separation @xmath4 @xmath29 4 - 20 r@xmath6 ( figure 3a ) .",
    "this close separation may seem problematic ; however , the brown dwarf spectroscopic binary ppl 15 has been shown to have an orbital separation of about 60 r@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "note that this scenario results in at least partial eclipsing for orbital inclination @xmath50 @xmath29 6 - 30@xmath51 , suggesting that photometric monitoring could detect a transit event in a period of @xmath5 1 - 10 hours . alternatively , radial velocity monitoring of the h@xmath0 line can produce a measurable variation ( v@xmath52 @xmath24 10 - 90 cos(@xmath50 ) km s@xmath14 ) over this period .",
    "the emission mechanism from overflow accretion is uncertain , as a hot accretion disk is ruled out by the lack of thermal continuum .",
    "ionization along a shock front or magnetic streaming onto the primary s pole are possibilities .",
    "nonetheless , we find this an intriguing and , more importantly , observationally constrainable hypothesis .",
    "a possible analogue to 2mass j1237 + 65 is the much warmer m9.5ve pc 0025 + 0447 , which was identified by @xcite in a search for high redshift quasars due to its unusually strong balmer line emission . the contribution of h@xmath0 luminosity to total luminosity ( log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) = @xmath33.4 ; schneider et al .",
    "1991 ) is a full order of magnitude stronger in this object than 2mass j1237 + 65 , and appears to be steady over a timescale of at least 7 - 8 years with no indication of flaring activity @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite argue that pc 0025 + 0447 is a young ( 600 myr ) brown dwarf ; if this were the case , then it is possible that 2mass j1237 + 65 is an evolved version of this object that has slowly declined in activity with age .",
    "@xcite propose various mechanisms for the activity in pc 0025 + 0447 , including sustained flaring and emission from a highly active , low - density corona .",
    "@xcite , however , argue against pc 0025 + 0447 being a brown dwarf based on significant li depletion , and propose that it is a hyades - age ( @xmath5 700 myr ) main sequence star with normal photospheric thermal emission .",
    "we propose a scenario in which pc 0025 + 0447 is itself an interacting binary , consisting of a @xmath5 0.1 m@xmath8 m dwarf and a brown dwarf companion losing mass to the primary .",
    "this scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed phenomena : roche lobe overflow from the companion provides a steady h@xmath0 emission source , accretion may lead to the observed variable veiling of the m dwarf spectrum @xcite , and the accreted material from the brown dwarf companion may retain lithium at primordial abundance , leading to the intermittent appearance of li 6707  absorption seen by @xcite , without requiring modification of the measured trigonometric parallax .",
    "extrapolation from figure 3 leads to similar maximal separations ( 3 - 25 r@xmath6 ) and periods ( 1 - 14 hours ) as for 2mass j1237 + 65 . unfortunately ,",
    "despite many photometric and spectroscopic observations of pc 0025 + 0447 , no time - resolved data is available to constrain this hypothesis .",
    "more detailed modeling is required to determine the feasibility of these mechanisms .",
    "we have reported the detection of h@xmath0 emission in the t dwarf 2mass j1237 + 65 , at a level of log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) = @xmath34.3 .",
    "this emission is intriguing , as it is a salient exception to the cool dwarf temperature - activity relations identified thus far .",
    "we have proposed various activity mechanisms , including a strong magnetic field , continuous flaring , and an interacting brown dwarf binary , but these are speculative guesses at best .",
    "comparison can be drawn with the m9.5ve pc 0025 + 0447 , which , if it is a brown dwarf , could be a warm analogue to 2mass j1237 + 65 .",
    "both objects could also be close binary systems with lower - mass brown dwarf companions , which are steadily transferring mass to their primaries by roche lobe overflow .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanism for both objects remains unclear .",
    "further investigation of the temporal stability of the h@xmath0 line in 2mass j1237 + 65 and searches for emission in other t dwarfs is clearly warranted .",

    "<S> we report the detection of h@xmath0 emission in the t dwarf ( methane brown dwarf ) 2massw j1237392 + 652615 over three days using the keck low resolution imaging spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> the measured line flux , log(l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) = @xmath34.3 , is roughly consistent with early m dwarf activity levels and inconsistent with decreasing activity trends in late m and l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> similar emission is not seen in two other t dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on several mechanisms that may be responsible for emission , including a strong magnetic field , continuous flaring , acoustic heat generation , and a close ( @xmath4 @xmath5 4 - 20 r@xmath6 ) interacting binary , with the cooler component overflowing its roche lobe . </S>",
