    "@xcite , are in preparation to attain microarcsecond ( @xmath2 ) level of accuracy in absolute positional measurements of stars and other celestial objects .",
    "this unprecedented accuracy of astrometric observations makes it necessary to account for many subtle effects which were totally negligible before .",
    "a practical model for astrometric observations with an accuracy of @xmath3 has been formulated by _",
    "@xcite , where the influence of the gravitational fields inside the solar system were taken into account .",
    "furthermore , a number of additional effects potentially observable at this level of accuracy due to various gravitational fields generated outside of the solar system were also briefly discussed in that investigation .",
    "one of them is the gravitational light deflection of one companion of a binary system in the gravitational field of the other companion ( without loss of generality , throughout the investigation the light deflection of component b at component a is considered , hence , component a is considered to be the massive body , while component b is the light - source ) .",
    "this effect would change the apparent position of one component of a binary system . while it is clear that this effect is relatively small and even at the level of @xmath3 observable only for edge - on binary systems ,",
    "the huge amount of binaries generate some hope that there are relevant systems where this light deflection effect becomes detectable .",
    "for instance , gaia will observe @xmath4 stars brighter than @xmath5 apparent magnitude .",
    "detailed numerical simulations predict the detection of about @xmath6 ( resolved , astrometric , eclipsing , spectroscopic ) binary systems by gaia mission , see _ zwitter & munari _",

    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider this argument a bit more quantitatively .",

    "it can be written as follows : @xmath8    here , @xmath9 is the light deflectin angle , @xmath10 is the inclination , @xmath11 is the semi - major axis and @xmath12 is the distance of center - of - mass of the binary system from the observer , and the schwarzschild radius is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant and @xmath15 is the speed of light , and @xmath16 is the stellar mass of component a of the binary system . from ( [ classical_lens_1 ] )",
    "one obtains the maximal possible light deflection for edge - on binaries , i.e. attained for the case when the inclination is exactly @xmath17 : @xmath18    here , @xmath19 is the astronomical unit , @xmath20 stands for parallax of one arcsecond , and @xmath21 is the solar mass . according to this formula",
    ", the choice of moderate values like @xmath22 and @xmath23 would result into significant light deflection effect on microarcsecond level even at large distances of about @xmath24 .",
    "a meaningful value for the density of stars in the solar neighborhood , @xmath25 , implies already @xmath7 binaries inside a sphere of @xmath26 .",
    "thus , one might conclude among them there are a few relevant edge - on binary systems .",
    "however , in order to estimate quantitatively the number of relevant systems , one needs to know the probability for the occurrence of such edge - on binaries which have a given light deflection depending on their orbital parameters like inclination , mass , distance and semi - major axis .",
    "such a relation between a given light deflection and orbital parameters is given by a so - called inclination formula .",
    "since the inclinations of binary systems are of course randomly distributed , it is meaningful to resolve such an inclination formula in terms of inclination . as it has been shown by _",
    "klioner , et al .",
    "_ @xcite ( see appendix [ appendix_kms ] for some basic steps ) , such an inclination formula can be obtained by means of the analytical solution of light deflection in standard post - newtonian approach , and is given as follows : @xmath27    for a better illustration of the inclination formula , relation ( [ kms_d ] ) is rewritten in terms of angular degrees instead of radians : @xmath28    where also @xmath29 has been used . according to this relation , the inclination @xmath10 of a binary system with stellar mass @xmath16 and at distance @xmath12 must not deviate from the edge - on value @xmath17 too much in order to have a given light deflection @xmath9 .",
    "for example , for a hypothetical binary star with @xmath22 situated at a distance of @xmath30 the light deflection effect attains @xmath3 only if @xmath31 , which means that the probability to observe this binary at a favorable inclination is only about @xmath32 .    but even this estimation is still much too optimistic . as a concrete example of todays high - precision astrometry ,",
    "let us consider one important parameter about the astrometric accuracy of the gaia mission : the accuracy of one individual positional measurement in the most ideal case ( bright star , i.e. @xmath33 magnitude ) amounts to be @xmath34 , which implies @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , inside a sphere of @xmath36 around the sun almost every star and binary system is known already by the data of _ research consortium on nearby stars ( recons ) _ @xcite . since inside that sphere there is no binary system having a light deflection on microarcsecond level",
    ", one has to take at least @xmath37 . by taking into account these both remarks",
    ", one obtains @xmath38 in relation ( [ condition_0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , even in the best case one has to conclude @xmath39 , that means ( for @xmath22 ) , the probability to observe such a binary at a favorable inclination is practically only about @xmath40 . and the binaries must be , in fact , almost edge - on in order to have a light deflection which can be detected by todays astrometry .",
    "accordingly , while relation ( [ classical_lens_2 ] ) triggers the hope about the existence of many relevant binary systems , from relation ( [ condition_0 ] ) one concludes that the number of relevant binary systems is considerably reduced .",
    "an estimation of the total amount of binaries depends on many different parameters , like mass , semi - major axis , inclination and distances of the binaries .",
    "therefore , a simple estimation is not so straightforward as one might believe .",
    "moreover , the relation ( [ classical_lens_2 ] ) has been obtained with the aid of classical lens equation , while relation ( [ condition_0 ] ) has been obtain by means of standard post - newtonian approach .",
    "these both approaches have different regions of validity .",
    "however , a rigorous treatment of the problem of light deflection in binary systems implies the need of an analytical formula which is valid for such kind of extreme astrometric configurations like the binary systems are .",
    "recently , a generalized lens equation has been derived by _",
    "zschocke _ @xcite , which allows to determine the light deflection of binary systems on microarcsecond level .",
    "one aim of this study is , therefore , to reobtain the criteria ( [ classical_lens_2 ] ) and ( [ condition_0 ] ) as stringent conditions from one and the same approach , i.e. with the aid of generalized lens equation .",
    "this is possible , because in the corresponding limits the generalized lens equation agrees with the classical lens equation and the standard post - newtonian solution .",
    "another aim is , to derive an inclination formula like ( [ kms_d ] ) for binary systems which allows to determine the needed inclination for a given light deflection angle and as a function of the orbital parameters . for that one",
    "has to take into account the distribution of stellar masses and the distribution of semi - major axes in binary systems .",
    "finally , the aim of this study is , to determine the total number of relevant binaries having a light deflection on microarcsecond level , and to investigate the possibility to detect this effect of light deflection by todays high precision astrometry .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ section1 ] some basics about orbital elements of binary systems are given . the generalized lens equation and the inclination formula",
    "are presented in section [ section2 ] . in section [ condition1 ] two stringent conditions on the orbital elements of binary systems ( astrometric , spectroscopic , eclipsing and resolved binaries )",
    "are presented , which allow to determine whether or not the binary system will have a light deflection of a given magnitude .",

    "the existence of such exotic binaries is , however , highly improbable .    in summary ,",
    "the main results are presented by the inclination formulae ( [ inclination_30_a ] ) and its simplified version ( [ inclination_50 ] ) , the stringent conditions ( [ condition_1 ] ) and ( [ condition_2 ] ) and by the diagrams fig .  [",
