    "objects have been classified as eros when they had redder colors than late type galaxies ( with negligible dust extinction ) at any redshift .",
    "however , depending on the depth of the photometry and on the available filters , different selection criteria have been used to select eros . in this paper",
    ", eros are defined as objects with @xmath55 ( see sect . 5 for more details on this choice ) .",
    "the red colors of eros are consistent with two classes of galaxies : they could be old , passively evolving elliptical galaxies at @xmath10 which are so red because of the large @xmath7correction .",
    "eros may also be strongly dust  reddened star  forming galaxies or agn .",
    "the observational results of the last few years showed that both classes of galaxies are indeed present in the ero population : on one hand , a few objects were spectroscopically confirmed to be @xmath11 ellipticals ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 , spinrad et al .",
    "1997 , liu et al .",
    "2000 , and marginally , soifer et al .",
    "1999 ) , or to have surface brightness profiles consistent with being dynamically relaxed early type galaxies ( e.g. stiavelli et al .",
    "1999 , benitez et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand",
    ", other eros have been detected in the sub ",
    "mm ( cimatti et al . 1998 , dey et al . 1999 , smail et al . 1999 ,",
    "andreani et .",
    "al . 2000 ) , thus providing examples of high  redshift starburst galaxies reddened by strong dust extinction and characterized by high star formation rates .",
    "the relative contribution of the two classes of objects to the whole ero population is still unknown , but there are preliminary indications , based on near - ir and optical spectroscopy and on surface brightness analysis , that ellipticals may represent the largest fraction of this population ( e.g. cimatti et al . 1999 , 2000 ; liu et al . 2000 ; moriondo et al . 2000 ) . a small fraction of low - mass - stars and brown dwarfs among eros is also expected in case of unresolved objects ( e.g. thompson et al . 2000 , cuby et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the importance of studying eros is clear especially for the clues that they could provide on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "for instance , existing realizations of hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict a significant decline in the comoving density of the ellipticals with @xmath9 , as they should form through merging at @xmath12 ( kauffmann 1996 , baugh et al .",
    "1996a ) , so that a measure of a decline of their comoving density would provide a stringent proof of these models .",
    "conflicting results have been found so far about such issue : some works claim the detection of a deficit of @xmath11 ellipticals ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "1996 , zepf 1997 , franceschini et al .",
    "1998 , barger et al . 1999 ,",
    "menanteau et al . 1999 ) , whereas others find that a constant comoving density of ellipticals up to @xmath13 is consistent with the data ( totani & yoshii 1997 , benitez et al . 1999 , broadhurst & bowens 2000 , schade et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a potentially serious problem in these studies is suspected to be the influence of the field - to - field variations in the density of eros due to the small fields of view usually covered in the near - infrared .",
    "for instance , barger et al . ( 1999 ) found a very low surface density of eros in a 60 arcmin@xmath2 survey to @xmath14 , while on a similar area mccracken et al .",
    "( 1999 ) observed a density three times larger at the same @xmath7 level .",
    "similar uncertainties have been found in the attempts of deriving the fraction of high redshift galaxies among ir selected samples , which is believed to be a stringent test for the formation of the massive galaxies ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1992 , kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "fontana et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using photometric redshifts , found that the fraction of high@xmath9 galaxies in a collection of small deep fields complete to @xmath15 was low and comparable with the predictions of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , but not with passive evolution ( ple ) models .",
    "the preliminary results of eisenhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , suggesting a much higher fraction of high@xmath9 galaxies , are instead consistent with both cdm and ple models .",
    "the main aim of our survey was to encompass the difficulties induced by the cosmic variance , obtaining a sample of eros on a large area , at moderately deep @xmath7 levels , in order to minimize and possibly to detect the effects of their clustering , and to compare the observed density with that expected in the case of passive evolution of ellipticals .",
    "our survey is larger by more than a factor of four than the thompson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) survey , and by more than an order of magnitude than all the other previous surveys for eros , at the same limiting magnitudes . with",
    "the large area covered we aimed also to detect a sample , or place limits to the surface density of the very rare class of extreme eros with @xmath16 .    in this paper , the observational results of this survey and their main implications are presented .",
    "a more detailed interpretation of our findings will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( daddi et al .",

    "the @xmath0 observations were made with the eso ntt 3.5 m telescope in la silla , during the nights of 2730 march 1999 , using the sofi camera ( moorwood et al .",
    "1998 ) with a field of view of about 5@xmath195@xmath20 .",

    "the observed field is one of the fields described in yee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to which we refer for details about its selection .",
    "the main criteria were not to have any apparent nearby clusters and to be at high galactic latitude .",
    "the images were taken with a pattern of fixed offsets of 144@xmath21 ( about half of the sofi field of view ) over a grid of 9@xmath3013 pointings .",
    "the total area covered by the observations was about 24@xmath3034 arcmin , with a local integration time of 12 minutes in the central deepest region of the field . in the shallower region , the effective integration time is reduced to not less than 6 minutes .",
    "the total amount of time required to cover the whole field was about 5.5 hours .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the iraf software .",
    "the images were flat - fielded with twilight flats .",
    "the sky background was estimated and subtracted for each frame using a clipped average of 68 adjacent frames ( excluding the central frame itself ) .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved each night with the observation of 5 - 7 standard stars taken from persson et al .",
    "the zero - points have a scatter of @xmath31 0.015 magnitudes in each night and a night - to - night variation within 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "each frame was scaled to the same photometric level correcting for the different zero - points and airmasses .",
    "accurate spatial offsets were measured for each frame using the area in common with the adjacent frames .",
    "the images were then combined , masking the known bad pixels , in order to obtain the final mosaic .",
    "the cosmic rays were detected and replaced by the local median using the task _ cosmicrays _ of the iraf package _",
    "ccdred_. the effective seeing of the final coadded mosaic ranges from 0.9@xmath21 to 1.1@xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath1-band data were taken in may 1921 1998 with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "the observations were done using the prime focus camera , equipped with a thinned 2048x4096 pixels eev10 chip , with a scale of 0.237@xmath21/pixel .",
    "this gives a field of view of about 8.1@xmath32 .",
    "a standard johnson @xmath1filter was used .",
    "the whole field has been covered by a mosaic of 6 pointings . each pointing consisted of at least 3 exposures of 1200s taken with small offsets .",
    "the total integration times per pointing was therefore 3600s , with the exceptions of two pointings with 4800s and 6000s .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved with standard stars taken from landolt ( 1992 ) with a scatter in the zeropoints , from the different stars used , below 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "the images were de - biased and then flatfielded , using a master flatfield constructed from the science exposures , scaled to the same zeropoint and then combined .",
    "the seeing of the final @xmath1-band mosaic was between 0.7@xmath21 and 0.8@xmath21 .",
    "the software sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was run on the @xmath0 mosaic with a background weighted threshold in order to take into account the depth variations across the area , as defined by sextractor . among the detected objects ,",
    "all those with s / n@xmath33 in a 2@xmath34 circular aperture ( twice the average seeing fwhm ) were selected and added to the catalog .",
    "a few spurious detections ( e.g. close to image defects ) have been excluded after a visual inspection of the image .",
    "the final catalog includes 4585 objects . in the central deepest region ,",
    "the 5@xmath35 limiting aperture magnitude is @xmath0(2@xmath34)=19.6 , whereas in the remaining area such limit is @xmath0(2@xmath34)19.2 because of the reduced integration time .",
    "isophotal magnitudes were measured with a limiting threshold of about 0.7@xmath36 corresponding in the central area to a surface brightness limit of about @xmath37 mag arcsec@xmath38 . the aperture correction from 2@xmath34 to total magnitudes",
    "was estimated throughout the area by measuring the difference between the isophotal and the 2@xmath21 aperture magnitudes for the stars with @xmath3916 .",
    "a differential correction , in the range of 0.160.30 magnitudes , was measured for different regions of the mosaic with a typical scatter less than 0.03 magnitudes . for the bright objects the isophotal magnitudes were on average consistent with the kron automatic aperture magnitudes .",
    "however , we adopted the isophotal magnitudes because the kron magnitudes are rather unstable at faint flux levels , where the low signal often does not allow to define the correct automatic aperture .",
    "the total @xmath0 magnitudes were then defined as the brightest between the isophotal and the corrected aperture magnitude .",
    "this allowed to safely assign a total magnitude for both the faint and the bright objects .",
    "the typical @xmath0 magnitude where the corrected aperture magnitude begins to be adopted as the total one is @xmath0@xmath3118 in the central deepest region .    the completeness of our catalog has been estimated by adding artificial objects to the @xmath0 mosaic in empty positions , using the iraf package _",
    "artdata_. point - like sources as well as objects with de vaucouleurs and exponential profiles ( convolved with the seeing psf ) were simulated , and sextractor was run with the same detection parameters as for the real data .",
    "the 85% completeness magnitude for the deepest area is @xmath40 for point - like sources .",
    "the completeness decreases to @xmath31  70% for the worst case that we have tested , i.e. for exponential galaxies with 0.7@xmath21 half  light radius . in the shallower area",
    "the corresponding limiting magnitude is @xmath3 .",
    "most of the @xmath41 galaxies are anyway expected to be only barely resolved with the @xmath0 1@xmath21 seeing ( saracco et al .",
    "1997 ) , and this certainly occurs for the distant @xmath10 ellipticals , and thus their completeness limits can be assumed to be similar to those for stars .      in order to recover the @xmath1-band counterparts of the @xmath0-selected objects , a coordinate mapping between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 images",
    "was derived .",
    "sextractor was then run in assoc mode with a search box of 2@xmath30 fwhm@xmath42 .",
    "the regions around bright stars or defects in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 band images were excluded from this analysis . the final effective area is 701 arcmin@xmath2 at @xmath3 and 447.5 arcmin@xmath2 at @xmath43 .    whenever an object had s / n@xmath443 in the @xmath1-band image 3@xmath35 limits were assigned .",
    "the 3@xmath35 limiting magnitude in a 2@xmath21 diameter aperture is @xmath45 for most of the area , reaching @xmath46 in the deepest pointing . when s / n@xmath473 , 2@xmath21 diameter corrected aperture magnitudes were assigned to each object .",
    "the aperture correction was derived in the same way as for the @xmath0-band , with slightly smaller corrections because of the better @xmath1-band seeing .",
    "the magnitudes were dereddened for galactic extinction . at the galactic coordinates of the center of our field ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , the extinction coefficients from burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) and from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "since the two values are derived in different ways , neither of the two can be discarded .",
    "the average was therefore adopted , obtaining a correction of 0.052 magnitudes in @xmath1 and negligible in @xmath0 .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty of @xmath31 0.03 magnitudes in the dereddened @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "finally , the @xmath8 colors are defined for all the objects as the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 corrected aperture magnitudes .",
    "thanks to the depth of the @xmath1-band data , colors as red as @xmath52 could be measured down to the @xmath0 magnitude limits of our survey . because of the long integrations used in the @xmath1-band the objects with @xmath53 were saturated .",
    "this effect is obviously more important for stars than for galaxies ; moreover , since we are interested in the extremely red galaxy population , the effects due to saturation have no impact on our results .      the star",
    " galaxy ( s / g ) separation was done by means of the sextractor class_star parameter in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 band .",
    "this classification was found to be reliable for objects with @xmath5417.5 and @xmath5524 . because of the seeing variations through the area in both bands , a variable class_star threshold was adopted in different subareas .",
    "given the better seeing of the @xmath1-band , the classification was based mostly on that band , switching to the @xmath0 class_star for objects close to the saturation level in @xmath1 .",
    "objects which are fainter than @xmath0 = 17.5 and @xmath1 = 24 have not been classified and have been considered to be galaxies .",
    "this means that a s / g separation can be provided only for objects with colors @xmath565 at @xmath0=19 , @xmath566 at @xmath0=18 , and so on ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] and the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccdiag ] ) . from the small number of objects classified as stars which are close to the diagonal straight line which indicates our s / g classification limit in the color - magnitude plane",
    ", we can safely conclude that our inability to properly classify very red , faint objects has almost no effect on the total star number counts and , therefore , on the galaxy number counts .",
    "in addition , it is possible that near the faint limit of our survey a very small fraction of very compact , blue galaxies , such as for instance agn or compact narrow emission line galaxies ( e.g. koo & kron 1988 ) , could have been incorrectly classified as stars .",
    "galaxy number counts in the @xmath0 band can provide more advantages in studying galaxy evolution and cosmological geometry than optical counts because they are much less sensitive to the evolution of stellar population and to the dust extinction .",
    "our survey , which covers the magnitude range @xmath57 , represents the widest among the previous deep surveys at levels fainter than @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig : roche ] ) , we can exclude the presence of measurable biases coming from the selection of the sample .    regarding the color measuraments ,",
    "since eros are the tail of objects in the @xmath8 color distribution , systematic variations of the photometric zeropoints across the area could have the effect of creating artificial ero overdensities and voids . to exclude this possibility we verified that the blue tail of the @xmath8 distribution is homogeneously spread across our survey , with a very low clustering amplitude . in case of zeropoints variations these should produce the same effect in both the tails of the color distribution .",
    "moreover , to test the reality of the large void of eros clearly seen in the bottom region of our survey ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib_sky ] ) , the @xmath8 color distribution of the galaxies inside and outside this large void were compared by means of a kolmogorov - smirnov test , selecting only the galaxies with @xmath1314 in both regions .",

    "all these tests strongly suggest that the inhomogeneous ero distribution is a real effect .",
    "the strong clustering signal that we find to increase with the @xmath8 threshold and to reach very high values for the eros is potentially capable of giving insight about the nature of these objects .",
    "the main possible source of objects that may contribute to the ero population , as discussed in the introduction , are old passively evolving @xmath10 ellipticals , dust - reddened starburst galaxies and , in case of unresolved objects , low - mass stars or brown dwarfs . our field being at high galactic latitude ( @xmath49 )",
    ", stars are expected to have no clustering , and to be homogeneously distributed , and certainly not to give the strong clustering signal detected . as for the starburst galaxies",
    ", it must be noted that in such galaxies the red colors are mainly driven by the amount of dust extinction and not by the redshift , as in the case of ellipticals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : color_fig ] ) , and therefore a wide redshift distribution is expected which should dilute their intrinsic clustering .",
    "moreover , it is known that the iras  selected galaxies ( which are typically star  forming galaxies ) have very low intrinsic clustering ( e.g. fisher et al .",
    "we can therefore reasonably conclude that the observed signal is due to the clustering of high redshift ellipticals .",
    "this is also suggested by studies of the local universe which have shown that early - type galaxies are much more clustered than late - type galaxies ( e.g. guzzo et al .",

    "these considerations strongly suggest that eros are mainly composed by @xmath10 ellipticals , confirming the previous indications that had been found on this issue .    as the elliptical galaxies are the dominant population of galaxy clusters , we investigated the possibility that the detected clustering of eros could be the result of a few massive clusters at @xmath133 present in our field .",

    "<S> we present the results of a wide  field survey for extremely red objects ( eros hereafter ) , the widest so far , based on @xmath0 and @xmath1 band imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers 701 arcmin@xmath2 and it is 85% complete to @xmath3 over the whole area and to @xmath4 over 447.5 arcmin@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the wide field covered , a complete sample of about 400 eros with @xmath55 was selected . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the eros on the sky is strongly inhomogeneous , being characterized by overdensities and large voids . </S>",
    "<S> we detect at the @xmath6 level a strong clustering signal of the eros which is about an order of magnitude larger than the clustering of @xmath7-selected field galaxies in the same magnitude range . a smooth trend of increasing clustering amplitude with the @xmath8 color is observed . </S>",
    "<S> these results are strong evidence that the largest fraction of eros is composed of high@xmath9 ellipticals , of which we detect for the first time the @xmath10 large scale structure clustering signal . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the surface density variations of the ero population found in our survey can explain the highly discrepant results obtained so far on the density of @xmath11 ellipticals , and we briefly discuss the main implications of our results for the evolution of elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the number counts and the colors of the @xmath7-selected field galaxies are also presented and briefly discussed . </S>"
