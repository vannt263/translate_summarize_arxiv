    "the interpretation of the kohn - sham orbital energies as quasiparticle energies also turns out to be successful and particular attention has been paid to the  lda , due to its numerical simplicity . however , in insulating materials , the lda tends to underestimate the band gap , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "as is well known , it is difficult to improve band structure calculations based on density functional theory .",
    "this is in particular the case when electron correlations are strong such that in quite some cases  @xcite the one - electron picture becomes inappropriate and corrections are needed .",
    "nevertheless , a number of ingenious methods have been devised to improve band structure results based on density functional theory .",
    "for example , the calculations have been supplemented by a gw  treatment , e.g. , refs  , or the so - called lda+@xmath1 method .",
    "@xcite other improvements concern the use of optimized effective potentials  @xcite such as the exact exchange potential  @xcite instead of its local , simplified form .",
    "time - dependent dft is another route to treat excited states more rigorously .",
    "furthermore , lda calculations have been coupled with various extensions of the coherent potential approximation  ( cpa ) like the dynamical cpa  @xcite or dynamical mean field theory  ( dmft ) .",

    "@xcite the same holds true for different forms of the projection operator technique .",
    "@xcite yet one must face the fact that the various approximations remain uncontrolled and therefore have to be reconsidered from case to case .",
    "when one is aiming at controlled approximations , two different routes offer themselves .",

    "it suffers from one serious shortcoming , the so - called sign problem when treating fermions .",
    "therefore , we are pursuing the second route .",
    "it starts from hartree - fock band structures and improves them by including correlations by means of many - particle techniques similar to the ones employed for molecules .",

    "@xcite the basic properties of the adc scheme and their derivations , as applied to molecules , are found in refs .  .",
    "among those size - extensivity is an important one since it is crucial when solids are considered .",
