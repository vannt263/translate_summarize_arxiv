    "essentially , two methods are known by which energy can be extracted from black holes .",
    "one is the classical method that is based on the existence of ergospheres of rotating black holes .",
    "it includes the penrose mechanism of test particles @xcite , the superradiance of an electromagnetic field , @xcite and the blandford - znajek effect of accretion disks with magnetic field @xcite for kerr black holes .",
    "moreover , it is possible to extract energy from reissner - nordstrom charged black holes because ergosphere - like structures of the black holes appear for charged particles @xcite .",
    "even though energy can be extracted from black holes using these classical methods , the horizon areas of the black holes do not decrease . if the quantum effect of matter is taken into account , energy extraction with a decrease in horizon area is possible .",
    "this is the second method of energy extraction , called the hawking effect @xcite , which describes black hole evaporation .",
    "black holes emit thermal radiation , accompanied by generation of negative energy flux that falls into the black holes .",
    "the hawking effect takes place spontaneously outside the horizon and can not be stopped artificially . in this paper , a new quantum mechanical method of energy extraction from black holes is proposed .",
    "this method is based on a gedanken experiment on quantum energy teleportation ( qet ) , which has been recently proposed in quantum information theory @xcite@xcite . in this method ,",
    "energy is extracted by a local quantum operation after a quantum measurement of quantum fluctuation of fields outside the horizons ; thus , it is not a spontaneous phenomenon like the hawking process . besides , the time scale of the qet process is very short compared to the hawking - process time scale of order of inverse of black - hole temperature .    the protocols of qet consist of local operations and classical communication .",
    "by measuring the local fluctuation induced by a zero - point oscillation in the ground state of a many - body quantum system and by announcing the measurement result to distant points , energy can be effectively teleported without breaking any physical laws including causality and local energy conservation .",
    "the key point is that there exists quantum correlation between local fluctuations of different points in the ground state .",
    "therefore , the measurement results of local fluctuation in a region include information about fluctuations in other regions . by selecting and performing a proper local operation that is based on the announced information ,",
    "the local zero - point oscillation of a place far from the measurement point can be squeezed , yielding negative energy density . during the local operation",
    ", surplus energy of the local fluctuation is emitted to the external systems and can be harnessed .",
    "we consider this qet protocol for @xmath0 massless fields in the near - horizon regions of large - mass black holes with near - horizon geometry described by the minkowski metric .",
    "the hartle  hawking state of the fields in the black hole spacetime , which is the thermal equilibrium state with the hawking temperature @xcite , is reduced to the minkowski vacuum state in flat spacetime . for each field ,",
    "a two - level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside the horizon during a short time period .",
    "the spin is measured to give 1-bit information about the fluctuation . after the measurement of @xmath0 fields , @xmath0-bit information , denoted by @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , is obtained .",
    "the post - measurement quantum states outputting @xmath1 are not the vacuum states but the states excited by the measurement devices .",
    "positive - energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole .",
    "the amount of excitation energy is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "after absorption of the wave packets and increase in the black hole mass , a @xmath1-dependent local operation of the @xmath4fields is performed outside the horizon .",
    "then , along with the extraction of positive energy from the fluctuation by the operation , negative - energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole . the mass of the black hole decreases due to absorption of the negative flux .",
    "this means that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the measurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the measurement results .",
    "though energy extracted by qet does not exhibit thermal property like hawking radiation , the energy extraction process involving measurement and the local operation , which generates a pair of excitations with positive and negative energy , is regarded as a controlled hawking process .",
    "it is noteworthy that if a unitary operation corresponding to a different @xmath0-bit sequence @xmath5 is performed , the amount of energy extracted by qet decreases . without any information about the correct @xmath1 , a unitary operation corresponding to a random @xmath0-bit sequence does not extract energy from the fields , but gives energy to the fields on average .",
    "this implies that a black hole , which swallows the wave packets generated by the measurement with output @xmath1 , remembers the information about @xmath1 .",
    "thus , black holes absorbing quantum states with different @xmath1 are physically different even though their classical geometries are the same .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the horizon shift of large - mass black holes in classical theory , using the cghs model . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze a gedanken experiment on qet in a near - horizon region .",
    "the summary and discussion are provided in section 4 .",
    "we adopt the natural unit @xmath6 .",
    "to briefly review the property of horizon shift in classical gravity , we adopt a two - dimensional soluble dilaton gravity model called the cghs model @xcite for simplicity . for higher - dimensional spherically symmetric black holes with large masses , we obtain essentially the same conclusion by treating falling matter with a spherically symmetric distribution . in the cghs model , the action is given by @xmath7{c}e^{-2\\varphi}\\left (   r+4(\\nabla\\varphi)^{2}+4\\lambda^{2}\\right ) \\\\",

    "the static black hole solutions are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the black hole mass .",
    "the horizon radius is given by @xmath13 .",
    "using new coordinates defined by @xmath14 , the metric is rewritten as@xmath15 the future horizon stays at @xmath16 in the new coordinates . because the scalar curvature on the horizon is proportional to @xmath17 , a very small @xmath9 yields the minkowski spacetime as the near - horizon geometry . in the near - horizon region with @xmath18 , the metric is reduced to @xmath19 .",
    "the matter field @xmath10 obeys the equation @xmath20 in the region and can be decomposed into left- and right - moving solutions as follows : @xmath21 .",
    "solutions with falling matter into the black hole with mass @xmath12 are also analytically obtained @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the incoming energy flux and is given by @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the metrics of general solutions in the @xmath25 coordinates also become the flat metric @xmath19 when @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the horizon shift due to absorption of matter can not be observed in these coordinates of the near - horizon region .    in order to observe the horizon shift , rescaled coordinates are available ; these are given by @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the metric is then rewritten as @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , the horizon shift is completed soon after the falling matter passes .",
    "if the support of @xmath23 is given by @xmath30 , the horizon stops soon after @xmath31 .",
    "the metric in the region with @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the enlarged black hole mass and the shifted future horizon stays at @xmath35 . even for higher dimensional spherically symmetric black holes of einstein gravity",
    ", the horizon also stabilizes soon after the falling matter passes if the matter takes the shape of spherical shells .",
    "this is because any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the einstein equation is static and equal to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "after the horizon is shifted , the classical geometry of the black holes holds no information except the total energy .",
    "however , as explained in the next section , the black hole remembers more information quantum mechanically .",
    "the horizon of the initial black hole stays at @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 quantum fields @xmath36 in the near - horizon region with the @xmath25 coordinates . because the fields are @xmath0 copies of a massless scalar field , we can concentrate on one of the fields and disregard the index @xmath37 for the time being .",
    "we consider a qet process with a time scale much shorter than inverse of the black hole mass which is the time scale of generation of the hawking radiation .",
    "thus , the hawking process can be neglected in the later discussion .",

    "because falling matter with the same mass , charge , and angular momentum generates the same geometry in classical theory , classical black holes forget the information after the shifted horizon stabilizes . meanwhile , many physicists believe , respecting the unitarity of theory , that quantum black holes do not forget the information and that the detailed memory is stored in some quantum mechanical ways . however , though many efforts to understand the quantum memory storage mechanism have been made so far , the complete resolution remains elusive . even in the case of large - mass static black holes , the question as to where the information is stored in the black - hole spacetimes has not been completely resolved . the information might be stored inside the horizons , on the horizons , or even outside the horizons .",
    "this is the so - called black hole entropy problem . from the results of this paper",
    ", we can conclude that some memories of absorbed quantum matter remains outside the horizon for a while , even after the shifted horizons are completely settled .",
    "the reason is following .",
    "if the unitary operation in eq .",
    "( [ 509 ] ) corresponding to a different @xmath0-bit sequence @xmath5 is performed after the black - hole absorption of wave packets with information @xmath1 , the amount of energy extracted by qet always decreases .",
    "any quantum operation @xmath209 with a wrong bit number @xmath80 does not generate negative energy ; instead , it generates positive energy of the field .",
    "hence , this execution of @xmath209 needs work .",
    "the amount of energy is @xmath210 .",
    "figure 5 shows a schematic diagram for the case of a wrong @xmath0-bit sequence @xmath211 .",
    "thus , if the wrong bit number per @xmath0 exceeds @xmath212 , there is no energy gain from the black hole on average by the qet process for the @xmath0 fields . in an extreme case , a random choice of @xmath209 yields @xmath213 energy input to the field on average .",
    "the black hole returns the maximum amount of energy by qet if the unitary operation obeying the correct @xmath1 is performed on the @xmath0 fields .",
    "therefore , the black hole remembers which @xmath1 state was absorbed .",
    "this implies that the black holes absorbing quantum states with different @xmath1 are physically different even though their black - hole geometries are the same outside the horizons . in this case , the information of @xmath1 is imprinted in the quantum fluctuation of the fields outside the horizon .",
    "in fact , in the region out of the horizon , the one - point function of @xmath131 depend on the measurement result @xmath1 as seen in eq .",
    "( [ 778 ] ) .",
    "though this observation is of much interest , these memories may be , in a precise sense , not black hole hairs contributing to the black - hole entropy .",
    "this is because the memories are not stored eternally , but may decay in time @xmath123 as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ 777 ] ) .",
    "this loss of memories over time suggests that the black - hole qet can be used as a probe for the thermal relaxation process of the black hole to a true quantum thermal equilibrium state .    before closing this discussion",
    ", i would like to add a comment about the unruh effect in the rindler spacetime @xcite @xcite .",
    "if we consider a detector coupled with quantum fluctuation of fields and uniformly accelerated in the vacuum , we observe thermal excitation in the detector as the unruh effect .",
    "this effect is artificially caused by measurements and not a spontaneous effect .",
    "the artificially induced effect is similar to the qet method described in this paper .",
    "however , the qet method is completely different from the unruh effect .",
    "the detector of our povm measurement is coupled with quantum fluctuation for a very short duration , though detectors used for observation of the unruh effect must be coupled with fluctuation over a very long period of time and should be simultaneously accelerated uniformly .",
    "the detector for qet is not accelerated at all . moreover , the measurement results read out of the detector are essential for qet .",
    "we give a quantum feedback to the field based on the measurement result . because of the dependence on the measurement result , the local operation given in eq .",
    "( [ 509 ] ) can generate negative energy on average of the field with extraction of positive energy outside the horizon .",
    "however , the measurement result in the unruh effect is not reused to give any feedback to the field .",
    "this is a quite different point from our model . in the reference @xcite ,",
    "unruh and wald also discussed a correlation of response of a particle detector with energy generated in a causally disconnected region from the detector of the rindler spacetime .",
    "this causally disconnected region corresponds to inside an eternal black hole when the detector is located outside the horizon .",
    "interestingly , positive energy density is induced in the causally disconnected region when the particle detector outside the  horizon is observed in the excited state . when the detector is observed in the ground state ,",
    "negative energy is induced in the region such that the average energy density in the causally disconnected region remains zero which is equal to the vacuum - state value .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the energy induced by the detector is located inside the horizon and can not be used for a person who stays outside the horizon .",
    "moreover , the average energy ( mass ) of the black hole does not change at all after the outside - horizon measurement .",
    "this feature is completely different from that of our qet model . in the qet model",
    ", the person outside the horizon can effectively get positive energy from the black hole via quantum fluctuation of the field outside the horizon .  the negative energy given by eq .",
    "( [ 701 ] ) is generated outside the horizon by the measurement and falls into the black hole so as to decrease the black hole energy .",
