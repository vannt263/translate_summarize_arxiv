    "the investigation of relativistic quantum information not only supplies the gap of interdiscipline refer to quantum information and relativity theory , but also has a positive promotion on the development of them . as a result of that , this domain has been paid much attention in the last decade @xcite . among them , most papers have focused on quantum resource , e. g. , quantum entanglement @xcite and discord @xcite , because the quantum resource plays an very important role in the quantum information tasks such as teleportation @xcite and computation @xcite , and studying it in a relativistic setting is very closely related to the implementation of quantum tasks with observers in arbitrary relative motion .",
    "in addition , extending this work to the black hole background is very helpful for us to understand the entropy and paradox @xcite of the black hole .",
    "despite much effort has been paid to extend quantum information theory to the relativistic setting , most papers are limited to entanglement and discord , another foundation of quantum mechanics ",
    "nonlocality is barely considered .",
    "recently , nicolai friis @xmath0 firstly studied the nonlocality in the noninertial frame , and they pointed out that residual entanglement of accelerated fermions is not nonlocal @xcite . following them ,",
    "alexander smith @xmath0 studied the tripartite nonlocality in the noninertial frames @xcite , and daekil park considered tripartite entanglement - dependence of tripartite nonlocality @xcite .",
    "generally , most researchers analyzed the quantum nonlocality by means of bell s inequalities @xcite for bipartite system and svetlichny inequality for tripartite system @xcite , respectively . because , these inequalities are satisfied by any local hidden variable theory , but they may be violated by quantum mechanics . however , shunlong luo and shuangshuang fu have introduced a new way to quantify nonlocality by measurement , which is called the min @xcite , and following their treatise , a number of papers emerged to perfect its definition @xcite and discussed its properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , some authors have analyzed its dynamical behavior and compared it with other quantum correlation measurements such as the geometric discord @xcite .",
    "however , all of these studies do nt involve the effect on the min resulting from relativistic effect .",
    "in fact , the study that how the unruh effect @xcite affects the min can help us implement the quantum task better and more efficient .",
    "inspired by that , in this paper we analyze how the unruh effect affects the min for both the dirac and bosonic fields and find some new properties .",
    "our paper is constructed as follows . in section",
    "[ definition of min ] we simply introduce the definition of the min . in sections [ dirac fields min ] and [ bosonic fields min ]",
    "how the unruh effect affects the min for dirac and bosonic fields is respectively studied .",
    "and we summarize and discuss our conclusions in the last section .",
    "recently , luo @xmath0 @xcite have introduced a way to quantify nonlocality from a geometric perspective in terms of measurements , which is called the min . for a bipartite quantum state @xmath1 shared by subsystem @xmath2 and @xmath3 with respective system hilbert space @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we can find the difference between the overall pre- and post - measurement states by performing a local von neumann measurements on part @xmath2 . to capture the genuine nonlocal effect of measurements on the state ,",
    "the key point is that the measurements do not disturb the local state @xmath6 .",
    "based on this idea , the min can be defined by @xmath7 for a general @xmath8 dimensional system @xmath9 its min is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a @xmath12 dimensional matrix , @xmath13 is its minimum eigenvalue , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "two sets of modes named rindler and minkowski modes are corresponding to the solutions of dirac equation in rindler and minkowski space - time , respectively .",
    "it is found that the combinations of minkowski modes called unruh modes can be transformed into monochromatic rindler modes .",
    "besides , they share the same vacuum state as the standard monochromatic minkowski modes .",
    "therefore , the annihilation operators of unruh modes can also annihilate the minkowski vacuum , and they are give by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote that particle and antiparticle operators in region @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath22 is unruh temperature .",
    "going beyond the single mode approximation @xcite , we consider a general unruh mode being an arbitrary combination of the independent unruh modes ( [ annihilation operators ] ) such as @xmath23 by using the creation operator to act on the vacuum , the associated single particle state is easily obtained .",
    "it is needed to note that the unruh modes are spatial delocalized , so can not be completely measured .",
    "additionally near the acceleration horizon they are highly oscillatory from the inertial observer s viewpoint .",
    "this implies that they are physically unfeasible states .",
    "however , using the unruh modes , we can get a family of solutions only depending on the parameterized acceleration @xmath24 ( or the unruh temperature @xmath22 ) .",
    "the entangled state constructed by them will be the maximally entangled in the inertial limit , and from the perspective of accelerated observers it is single - frequency entangled state .",
    "moreover , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of unruh modes to extract conclusions regarding fundamental physics can be justified according to some desirable features , such as they are purely positive frequency linear combinations of minkowski modes , and share the same vacuum with minkowski monochromatic modes , and so on .",
    "these features ensure that the parameterized acceleration dependent states can describe the behavior of maximally entangled states in small acceleration limit , and they also yield the correct behavior for physical states in the large acceleration limit , so a main result ( different behaviors between the bosonic fields and dirac fields in the infinite accelerated limit ) in our paper can also applies to the physical states .",
    "furthermore , such results qualitatively describe the behavior for the relevant states as a function of the acceleration . for these reasons ,",
    "the unruh modes are commonly used in literatures .",
    "usually , the unruh monochromatic mode @xmath25 , from the non - inertial observers perspective , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath26 where the notation @xmath27 is used .",
    "likewise , the particle state of unruh mode @xmath28 in the rindler basis is found to be @xmath29    noting that different ordering of operators leads to fermionic entanglement ambiguity in non - inertial frames because of the anticommutation relation satisfied by fermionic operators .",
    "however , only one of these ordering gives physical results , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the physical ordering in our paper .",
    "we now assume that alice and rob share a x - type initial state @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the identity operator in subspace @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the pauli operator in direction @xmath34 acting on the subspace @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , eq . ( [ initial states ] ) represents a class of states including the well - known initial states , such as the werner initial state ( @xmath39 ) , and bell basis state ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "after the coincidence of alice and rob , alice stays stationary while rob moves with an uniform acceleration @xmath41 . to describe the states shared by these two relatively accelerated observers in detail",
    ", we must use eqs .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) and ( [ particle state ] ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ initial states ] ) in terms of minkowski modes for alice , rindler modes i for rob and rindler modes ii for anti - rob , which implies that rob and anti - rob are respectively confined in region @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the regions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are causally disconnected , and the information which is physically accessible to the observers is encoded in the minkowski modes @xmath2 and rindler modes @xmath42 , but the physically unaccessible information is encoded in the minkowski modes @xmath2 and rindler modes @xmath43 .",
    "so we must trace over the rindler modes @xmath43 ( modes @xmath42 ) when we only consider the physically accessible ( unaccessible ) information .",
    "we first consider the min between modes @xmath2 and particle modes in region @xmath42 . by taking the trace over the states of region @xmath43 and antiparticle states of region @xmath42 , we obtain the reduced density matrix of alice - rob modes @xmath44 where @xmath45 . for convenience to calculate the min , we rewrite the state @xmath46 in terms of bloch representation , which is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . from eq .",

    "otherwise , the min decays monotonously as the temperature increases .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , if @xmath70 , we have a monotonic decay of @xmath68 .",
    "the decrease of the min means that the difference between the pre- and post - measurement states becomes smaller , i.e. , the disturbance induced by local measurement weaken .",
    "if we understand the min as some kind of correlations , this decrease means that the quantum correlation shared by two relatively accelerated observers decreases , i.e. , less quantum resource can be used for the quantum information task by these two observers .",

    "a distinctly distinguishable property of the min in non - inertial frames is that the min between dirac fields remains non - zero in the infinite acceleration limit , while for bosonic fields it vanishes . which indicates that the min between dirac fields is more robust than bosonic fields case when they undergo unruh effect .",
    "furthermore , for dirac fields there is no fundamental difference of degradation ( increase ) of min between alice - rob modes ( alice - antirob modes ) when we takes different @xmath63 .",
    "however , for bosonic fields different @xmath63 will lead to different dynamic behaviors of its min .",
    "different statistics for dirac and bosonic fields directly result in these distinctions . which suggests fundamental differences between infinite and finite dimensional system min in relativistic settings .",
    "our discussion can be extended to the background of black hole by assuming that rob locates at the event horizon , while alice freely falls into the black hole .",
    "therefore , by replacing the unruh temperature with hawking temperature , our result shows that the min for dirac fields persists in the infinite hawking temperature limit , while that for bosonic fields vanishes .",
    "it is believed that further investigation of relativistic quantum information may have implications for the problem of black hole information loss .",
