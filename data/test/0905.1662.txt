    "usually , equilibrium isotope effects are computed only approximately:@xcite in particular , effects due to indistinguishability of particles and rotational and vibrational contributions to the eie  are treated separately .",

    "none of the contributions , not even the indistinguishability effects can be separated from the others.@xcite however , at room temperature or above the nuclei can be accurately treated as distinguishable , and the indistinguishability effects can be almost exactly described by symmetry factors . on the other hand",
    ", the effective coupling between rotations and vibrations , anharmonicity of vibrations , and non - rigidity of rotations can in fact become more important at higher temperatures .",
    "for simplicity , from now on we denote these three effects together as  anharmonicity effects  and the approximation that neglects them the  harmonic approximation  ( ha ) . in some cases",

    "therefore , two approximations that we make are the born - oppenheimer approximation and the distinguishable particle approximation ( we treat indistinguishability by appropriate symmetry factors ) .",
    "the error due to the born - oppenheimer approximation was studied for h / d eie by bardo and wolfsberg,@xcite and by kleinman and wolfsberg,@xcite and was shown to be of the order of 1 % in most studied cases . since we assume that nuclei are point charges , the born - oppenheimer approximation implies that the potential energy surface is the same for the two isotopomers .",
    "the differences of born - oppenheimer surfaces due to differences of nuclear volume and quadrupole of isotopes can be important for heavy elements@xcite , but these are not studied in this work .",
    "symmetry factors themselves result in an eie equal to a rational ratio , which can be computed analytically . in order to separate the symmetry contributions from the mass contributions to the eie , it is useful to introduce the reduced reaction free energy,@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the symmetry factors discussed in more detail in sec .",

    "the ultimate goal would be to combine the path integral methodology with _ ab initio _ potentials .",
    "however , since millions of samples are required , the computational expense results in the following  compromise :  first , the equilibrium isotope effects are computed using _ ab initio _ potentials , but as usual , within the ha . then all anharmonicity corrections are computed using the pi methodology , but with semiempirical potentials .",
    "in other words , we take advantage of the higher accuracy of the _ ab initio _ potentials to compute the harmonic contribution to the eie and then make an assumption that the anharmonicity effects are similar for _ ab initio _ and semiempirical potentials .    after describing theoretical features of the method",

    "to determine the suitability of semiempirical methods used in our pimd calculations , we first compared values of the eie in the ha .",

    "so is the difference between am1 and b98 methods . on the other hand , the scc - dftb method clearly overestimates the extent of eie compared to both higher level methods .",
    "a very similar trend was observed in all examined reactions .",
    "other semiempirical methods tested were pm3@xcite and scc - dftb - mwm , which are not included in fig . 6 in the paper for clarity",
    "the pm3 method overestimates the eie similarly to scc - dftb , whereas the scc - dftb - mwm curve is somewhat closer to _ ab initio _ curves than the scc - dftb one . to conclude , from this point of view am1 is the preferred semiempirical method .",
    "during simulations , the pentadiene molecule often passes two potential energy barriers .",
    "these are the barrier for the hindered rotation of the methyl group and the barrier for the rotation of the vinyl group , which connects s-_trans _ and s-_cis _ conformations .",
    "relaxed potential energy scans of these two motions were employed as the second criterion to assess the relevancy of semiempirical methods .",
    "methods tested were mp2 , b98 , am1 , scc - dftb , scc - dftb - mwm , pm3 , rm1,@xcite pm3carb-1,@xcite pddg / pm3,@xcite and pm6.@xcite potential surface scans with pm3carb1 , rm1 , pm3/pddg methods were calculated using the public domain code mopac 6 .",
    "pm6 potential surface scans were performed in mopac 2007.@xcite results for the methyl group rotation are shown in fig .",

    "the height of the am1 barrier is only 0.005 @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , positions of minima do not agree with b98 and mp2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scc - dftb method matches higher level methods closely . from other semiempirical methods pm3 performs best in this aspect .",
    "the height of the barrier is relatively well reproduced also by pddg / pm3 , rm1 and scc - dftb - mwm methods , but positions of extrema of the potential energy surface are incorrect .",
    "figure [ fig : vinyl_scan ] shows potential energy scans of the s-_trans_/s-_cis _ rotation of the vinyl group .",
    "again , the scc - dftb method matches higher level methods closely .",
    "all other methods ( with the exception of dftb ) give too low barrier heights as well as too low energy differences between s-_trans _ and s-_cis _ conformations .",
    "also note that the potential energy surfaces of pm3 and related methods ( pddg / pm3 and pm3carb-1 ) are not smooth in the gauche region .",
    "this peculiarity of the pm3 potential surface can be seen also in the potential surface scan performed by liu _ _ et al.__@xcite      based on these results we concluded that none of the semiempirical methods except for scc - dftb is able to sufficiently improve the am1 potential energy surface .",
    "whereas the frequency optimized variant of the scc - dftb method ( scc - dftb - mwm ) improves the eie in the ha , it does not retain the scc - dftb accuracy in the potential surface scans .",
    "hence we decided to use the am1 and scc - dftb potentials for pimd calculations .",
    "to conclude , am1 performs very well in ha , but it can not properly describe potential surfaces of the two rotational motions realized during simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "scc - dftb gives worse results in ha , but it reproduces both barriers very well ."
