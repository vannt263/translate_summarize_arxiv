    "quantum many - body systems of one - dimensional ( @xmath1 ) interacting particles have attracted an enormous interest for more than fifty years  @xcite and are nowadays available in a large number of different laboratory systems ranging from single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite to semiconductor nanowires  @xcite , conducting molecules  @xcite , chiral luttinger liquids at fractional quantum hall edges  @xcite , and trapped atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "regardless of statistics , the effective low - energy description of these systems is based on a harmonic theory of long - wavelength fluctuations  @xcite , _ i.e. _ on the  luttinger liquid \" model  @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the luttinger liquid is that its low - energy excitations are independent collective oscillations of the charge density _ or _ the spin density , as opposed to individual quasiparticles that carry both charge and spin .",
    "this leads immediately to the phenomenon of spin - charge separation  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the fact that the low - energy spin and charge excitations of @xmath1 interacting fermions are completely decoupled and propagate with different velocities .",
    "this behavior has been recently demonstrated by kollath _",

    "the possibility of studying these phenomena experimentally in @xmath1 two - component cold fermi gases  @xcite , where  spin \" and  charge \" refer , respectively , to two internal ( hyperfine ) atomic states and to the atomic mass density , was first highlighted by recati _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite two of us have pointed out a new aspect of spin - charge separation : namely , spin excitations are intrinsically damped at finite temperature , while charge excitations are not .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is easy to grasp . in a pure spin pulse",
    "the up - spin and down - spin components of the current are always equal and oppositely directed , so that the density remains constant .",
    "the relative motion of the two components gives rise to a form of friction known , in electronic systems , as ",
    "_ spin coulomb drag _ \"  @xcite .",
    "this is responsible for a hydrodynamic behavior due to a randomization of  spin momentum \" deriving from excitations in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 regions .",
    "in the course of time this leads to diffusive spreading of the packet .",
    "no such effect is present in the propagation of pure density pulses , which are therefore essentially free of diffusion in the long wavelength limit  @xcite ( by contrast , a density pulse in a normal fermi liquid is always expected to decay into particle - hole pairs  a process known as landau damping  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of ref .   was limited to spin - compensated ( unpolarized ) systems .",
    "in particular , the calculation of the spin - drag relaxation time @xmath0 was done only for unpolarized systems .",
    "it is of great interest to extend the calculation to spin - polarized systems .",
    "first , a finite degree of spin - polarization is the most general situation in experiments .",
    "second , and most important , any attempt to study the dynamics of spin packets beyond the linear approximation will have to take into account the spin - polarization of the liquid within the packet .",
    "this is particularly crucial in the time - dependent spin - current - density functional approach  @xcite , which treats spin - current relaxation through a local spin - drag relaxation rate .",
    "calculations done by this method will therefore require knowledge of @xmath0 as a function of the local spin polarization and temperature . finally , our study is relevant to the closely related problem of the regular coulomb drag ( no spin involved ) between two semiconductor wires with different carrier densities .",
    "here the two wires play formally the role of the two spin orientations , and the difference in density corresponds to the spin polarization .",
    "our careful analysis of the low temperature regime yields a new formula for the temperature and polarization dependence of @xmath0 , which is completely different from the one that was obtained previously by a qualitative method  @xcite .",

    "<S> spin propagation in systems of one - dimensional interacting fermions at finite temperature is intrinsically diffusive </S>",
    "<S> . the spreading rate of a spin packet is controlled by a transport coefficient termed  spin drag \" relaxation time @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present both numerical and analytical calculations of @xmath0 for a two - component spin - polarized cold fermi gas trapped inside a tight atomic waveguide . at low temperatures we find an activation law for @xmath0 , in agreement with earlier calculations of coulomb drag between slightly asymmetric quantum wires , but with a different and much stronger temperature dependence of the prefactor . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a fundamental input for microscopic time - dependent spin - density functional theory calculations of spin transport in @xmath1 inhomogeneous systems of interacting fermions . </S>"
