    "the current understanding of topological matter @xcite is mostly based on a single - particle description .",
    "a paradigmatic example is the integer quantum hall effect : in the absence of interactions , the hall conductivity has a deep topological interpretation@xcite , which explains its quantization and stability .",
    "a more recent example is provided by the classification of time - reversal invariant insulators @xcite , which , again , relies on the properties of the noninteracting bloch functions .",
    "understanding the effect of interactions on topological matter has become a very active area of research @xcite .",
    "a natural model in which to explore such issues is the _ haldane - hubbard model_. the haldane - hubbard model describes spin-1/2 electrons on the honeycomb lattice , interacting via a local hubbard interaction of strength @xmath0 .",
    "the electrons hop between nearest neighbor sites with hopping strength @xmath1 , and between next - to - nearest neighbor sites with alternating hopping parameters @xmath2 : the phases @xmath3 describe a transverse magnetic field , with zero net flux through the honeycomb plaquette .",
    "finally , the system is also exposed to a staggered chemical potential , with strength @xmath4 on the two triangular sublattices . in the absence of interactions",
    "@xcite this model shows , depending on the value of its parameters , a trivial insulating phase with vanishing transverse conductivity @xmath5 , or a quantum hall phase with @xmath6 .",
    "these topological phases are separated by two critical curves in the @xmath7 plane , intersecting at the crossing points @xmath8 and @xmath9 . along the critical curves ,",
    "the energy bands touch at a conical intersection ; at the crossing points , there are two such conical intersections , as in standard graphene . indeed if @xmath10 the system describes graphene with short range interaction .    from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the haldane topological phases have been argued to emerge in pure graphene sheets by spontaneous mass generation , due to the strong , unscreened coulomb repulsion @xcite . from an experimental viewpoint , the haldane model has been realized in ref.@xcite , and the topological phase transition has been observed .",
    "the inclusion of a tunable hubbard interaction seems to be accessible by the present technology .",
    "therefore , studying its effects on the transport coefficients is of fundamental importance for the next generation of cold atom experiments .",
    "so far , the properties of the haldane - hubbard model have been investigated mostly via mean - field , variational and numerical analyses@xcite .    concerning the _ transverse conductivity _ , topological arguments for interacting systems@xcite",
    "ensure that , away from the critical curves , @xmath11 can only take integer values , in units of @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 are the elements of the conductivity matrix , in the limit of zero frequency and zero temperature ) .",
    "however , its specific value at a given point in the phase diagram can be different from the corresponding non - interacting value , in particular in the vicinity of the critical curves ( at weak coupling , far from the critical lines , the conductivity is known to be independent of the interaction @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant question here is to distinguish between two scenarios : the first , in which small interactions are not able to generate new phases and their main effect is a shift of the critical curves , as found in certain 3d topological insulators @xcite ; and a second one , characterized by the emergence of a novel , interaction - induced , topological phase , like the one corresponding to @xmath14 , predicted for the haldane - hubbard model in ref.@xcite .",
    "regarding the _ longitudinal conductivity _",
    ", in the absence of interactions it is equal to @xmath15 , for all the values of @xmath16 _ on _ the critical lines , with the exception of the crossing points @xmath17 , where it is equal to @xmath18 ( of course , away from the critical lines @xmath19 ) .",
    "there are no topological arguments ensuring that the _ critical _ longitudinal conductivity should remain quantized when the interaction is switched on : therefore , the relevant question here is whether the interaction introduces corrections breaking this exact quantization or not .",
    "this question is related to a similar one discussed in the context of graphene , in which recent experiments @xcite showed that the optical longitudinal conductivity is essentially universal , and in excellent agreement with the value computed for the non - interacting model @xcite ; on the contrary , the interaction produces dramatic effects on other physical quantities , such as the fermi velocity @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the universal behavior in graphene is still not completely understood @xcite , see , in particular , ref.@xcite for a recent review .",
    "a rigorous result for short range interaction @xcite showed that , in order to get exact universality of graphene s longitudinal conductivity , one needs to fully take into account the non linear correction to the bands , even if such terms are irrelevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense .    in this paper",
    "we compute the conductivity matrix of the haldane - hubbard model via exact rg methods , close to and at the critical lines , for weak interactions .",
    "we take lattice effects into account , and we exploit _ lattice _ symmetries in order to reduce the number of independent running couplings , in a way similar to ref.@xcite for graphene .",
    "the use of exact rg methods is motivated by the fact that the computation of conductivity is extremely sensitive to the choice of the regularization scheme@xcite . even though they are irrelevant in the rg sense , lattice and interaction effects produce , in general , _ finite corrections _ to the physical observables , and they must be taken into account in order to prove or disprove the emergence of new interaction - induced topological phases , as well as to address the issue of universality of the critical longitudinal conductivity .    by choosing the chemical potential @xmath20 so to fix the fermi energy half - way between the valence and conduction bands , the band gap can only close at the two fermi points @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the _ valley _ index .",
    "we prove that , close to criticality , the interacting euclidean two - point function is : & & s_2(k_0,p_f^+k ) = + & & = -    ik_0 z_1,r - m_r & v_r(-ik_1+k_2 ) + v_r(ik_1+k_2 ) & ik_0",

    "the parameters @xmath27 , depend non - trivially on the valley index @xmath28 and on the interaction .",
    "in particular , the renormalized mass @xmath29 reads : [ fpm ] m_r,=w 3t_2-f_(u , w , ) where @xmath30 is the valley index , and @xmath31 is expressed in the form of a _ convergent _ renormalized series , whose first non - trivial order is given by eq .",
    "the dressed critical lines , defined by the condition that the renormalized mass vanishes , are also modified by the interaction , see fig.[figaltezza ]",
    ". similarly , the fermi velocity @xmath32 and the wave function renormalizations @xmath33 have non - trivial interaction corrections and , remarkably , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are _ different _ , as shown in fig.[fig1 - 2 ] .",
    "all these non - universal renormalizations are _ absent _ in effective relativistic descriptions : by neglecting the ( irrelevant ) non - linear corrections to the energy bands , one would obtain a nambu - jona lasinio model , in which lorentz and chiral symmetry would imply the invariance of @xmath32 , the invariance of the critical lines and @xmath36 .",
    "however , these extra symmetries are broken by the lattice , and the renormalization of the effective parameters is a physical signature of many body interaction that should be visible in real systems , e.g. , in cold atom experiments .",
    "these non - universal parameters also enter the computation of the conductivity : remarkably , they are related by exact _",
    "lattice ward identities _ , which induce non - trivial cancellations and imply subtle universality properties , as stated in the following theorem .",
    "we recall that @xmath13 are the elements of the kubo conductivity matrix , in the limit of zero frequency and zero temperature .",

    "_ there exists @xmath43 such that for @xmath44 , the system is massless if and only if the right side of eq .",
    "this condition defines two renormalized critical curves intersecting at @xmath17 , separating two non - trivial topological phases , characterized by transverse conductivity @xmath45 , from two standard insulating phases , see fig.[figaltezza ] . on the renormalized critical curves ,",
    "the critical longitudinal conductivity @xmath46 , @xmath47 , is quantized : if @xmath48 , _ ii^ = , while @xmath49 at @xmath17 . _",
    "thus , the critical lines acquire non - universal , interaction - dependent corrections , but they still separate topological regions labelled by @xmath50 from the trivial ones , labelled by @xmath51 , see fig.[figaltezza ] .",
    "new intermediate phases characterized by the quantum number @xmath52 are _ rigorously excluded _ at weak coupling : the universality class of the topological transition remains unchanged .",
    "the effect of the repulsive interaction is to _ enlarge _ the topologically non - trivial region , see fig.[figaltezza ] .",
    "this enhancement agrees with the numerical findings of ref.@xcite and is presumably a sign that repulsive interactions in graphene - like systems can favor the spontaneous generation of the topological insulating phase @xcite .",
    "even if not protected by any topological argument , the critical longitudinal conductivity @xmath53 is _ exactly universal _ and equal to half the one of graphene , on the whole critical line , with the exception of the special crossing points @xmath8 and @xmath9 , at which the value of @xmath53 is the same obtained for interacting graphene@xcite , namely @xmath54 : each dirac cone contributes with a universal quantity @xmath55 to the critical longitudinal conductivity . of course , away from the critical curves , the longitudinal conductivity is exactly zero .",
    "our results are in agreement with a low energy description in terms of an effective action that includes a non - trivial chern - simons term , whose coefficient ( the hall conductivity ) is proportional to the difference of the signs of the renormalized masses , @xmath56 , rather than the bare ones , as one would get in the relativisitic approximation @xcite .    the theory that we develop is _ non perturbative _ , in the sense that it allows us to express all the correlations and transport coefficients in terms of _ convergent _ series .",
    "as it will appear from the analysis , our non - perturbative bounds on the correlation functions , once combined with ward identities , allow us to conclude the universality of the conductivity , without exploiting explicit cancellations at all orders .",
    "we have not tried to optimize the estimate for the radius of the convergence domain , which , therefore , is expected to be far from the values of @xmath0 where interaction - induced phase transitions might take place .",
    "however , we believe that the range of validity of our convergent expansions could be improved by combining our analysis with numerical techniques , as it is done , for instance , for the stability of kam tori in classical mechanics .",
    "finally , we stress that our analysis only requires the interaction to be short - ranged , we considered the hubbard interaction just for the sake of definiteness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the haldane - hubbard model , and derive the exact lattice ward identities for its correlation functions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we perform an exact renormalization group analysis for the correlations , we classify the allowed running coupling constants by the exact lattice symmetries of the system , and we compute the decay of the correlations at large distances , as well as the renormalized critical line . in section [ sec4 ]",

    "we expect such effects to have profound implications for the haldane - hubbard model , especially in the proximity of the critical lines separating the different topological phases .",
    "we plan to investigate this issue in future work .",
    "the work of a.g . has been carried out thanks to the support of the a*midex project hypathie ( no anr-11-idex-0001 - 02 ) funded by the `` investissements davenir '' 25 french government program , managed by the french national research agency ( anr ) , and by a c.n.r.s .",

    "we denote by @xmath363 the modified hamiltonian , and let the ( paramagnetic ) current be @xmath364 , where @xmath47 label the two ( orthogonal ) coordinate directions @xmath365 and @xmath366 . an explicit computation leads to , with @xmath367 and , defining @xmath368 , & & m_11(k ,",

    "in this appendix , we discuss some of the details of the numerical computations from which figs.[figaltezza]-[fig1 - 2 ] were produced .",
    "the program used to carry them out is available online @xcite , has been named hhtop , and is released under an apache license .",
    "the source code includes a documentation file , in which the computations are described in greater detail .",
    "the numerical computations carried out in this work involve numerical evaluations of integrals .",
    "the algorithm that was used to carry these out is based on _ gauss - legendre _ quadratures , by which , given an integer @xmath371 , an integral is approximated by a discrete sum with @xmath372 terms : @xmath373 where @xmath374 are the roots of the @xmath372-th legendre polynomial @xmath375 , and @xmath376    if @xmath118 is an analytic function , then one can show that the remainder @xmath377 decays exponentially in @xmath372 .",
    "however , in order to compute the difference of the wave - function renormalizations , we need to compute the integral of an integrand that , instead of being analytic , is a class-2 gevrey function ( a class-@xmath378 gevrey function is a @xmath379 function whose @xmath216-th derivative is bounded by @xmath380 , so that analytic functions are class-1 gevrey functions ) .",
    "the remainder @xmath377 can be shown to be bounded , if @xmath118 is a class-@xmath378 gevrey function with @xmath381 and @xmath372 is large enough ( independently of @xmath118 and @xmath378 ) , by @xmath382 for some @xmath383 , that only depend on @xmath118 . for a proof of this statement ,",
    "see lemma  a3.1 in the documentation of hhtop@xcite . in short , this estimate is obtained by expanding @xmath118 in chebyshev polynomials , and using a theorem of a.c .",
    "curtis and p. rabinowitz@xcite that shows that , if @xmath118 is the @xmath384-th chebyshev polynomial , then @xmath377 is bounded uniformly in @xmath384 .",
    "the decay of the coefficients of the chebyshev expansion of class-@xmath378 gevrey polynomials allows us to conclude .",
    "there is a single , minor , pitfall in the numerical evaluation of @xmath387 : we wish to use gauss - legendre quadratures ( see app.[app.gauss_legendre ] ) to carry out the computation , but the integrand in ( [ eq.fnumeric ] ) is not smooth : indeed , if @xmath388 , then its second derivative diverges at @xmath389 due to the divergence of the derivative of @xmath390 .",
    "however , by switching to polar coordinates @xmath391 , this singularities is regularized , that is , the integrand becomes a smooth function of @xmath392 and @xmath393 . at this point",
    ", there is yet another danger to avoid : while the integrand is smooth , the upper bound of the integral over @xmath392 is a function of @xmath393 , which is , due to the rhombic shape of @xmath394 , only smooth by parts .",
    "the integral over @xmath393 must , therefore , be split into parts in which the bounds of the integral over @xmath392 are smooth .",
    "this can be done very easily using the @xmath395 rotation symmetry .",
    "once both of these traps have been thwarted , gauss - legendre quadratures yield very accurate results .    in order to compute the correction to the critical line",
    ", we solve @xmath396 for @xmath397 and @xmath398 . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we have made the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath387 explicit . to solve ( [ eq.mass1 ] ) , we fix @xmath398 , and use a newton algorithm to compute the critical value of @xmath397 : we set @xmath399 , and compute @xmath400 provided @xmath401 is not too far from the solution of ( [ eq.mass1 ] ) , @xmath402 converges _ quadratically _",

    ", @xmath320 is @xmath405 where @xmath406 the computation is carried out on the critical line , that is , when @xmath407 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath350 and @xmath408 can be carried out explicitly : @xmath409\\hskip15pt\\cdot      \\left(\\frac{(\\xi_p+\\xi_q+\\xi_f)(\\frac{m_p}{\\xi_p}+\\frac{m_q}{\\xi_q}-\\frac{m_f}{\\xi_f}-\\frac{m_pm_qm_f}{\\xi_p\\xi_q\\xi_f})z}{(z^2-(\\xi_p+\\xi_q+\\xi_f)^2)^2}\\right )    \\end{array }    \\label{eq.z1-z2}\\ ] ] where , using the definitions of @xmath317 , @xmath410 and @xmath109 after and after , @xmath411 , @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , @xmath415 and @xmath416 , @xmath417 , @xmath418 .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the integral in ( [ eq.z1-z2 ] ) involves a similar difficulty to that in ( [ eq.fnumeric ] ) : the integrand has divergent derivatives if any of the following conditions hold : @xmath419 , @xmath420 or @xmath421 .",
    "these singularities can not be regularized by changing @xmath422 and @xmath423 to polar coordinates , since @xmath424 is a singular function of the polar coordinates of @xmath422 and @xmath423 ( due to the fact that it behaves , asymptotically , as @xmath425 approaches @xmath426 , as @xmath427 , which has divergent second derivatives ) . however , there are coordinates , which we call _ sunrise coordinates _ ( since @xmath428 is the value of the so - called _ sunrise _ feynman diagram ) , which regularize these singularities .",
    "their expression is rather long , and will not be expounded here ; the interested reader is invited to consult the documentation file bundled with the source code of hhtop@xcite . once written in terms of the sunrise",
    "coordinates , the integral in ( [ eq.z1-z2 ] ) can be computed using gauss - legendre quadratures very accurately .        c. l. kane and e. j. mele , phys .",
