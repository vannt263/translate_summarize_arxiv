    "virtual knots and virtual links are a generalisation of classical knots and classical links . they were introduced by l.  kauffman . they can be seen as a combinatorial interpretation of copies of @xmath0 embedded in thickened surfaces with genus @xmath1 instead of copies of @xmath0 embedded in @xmath2 .",
    "virtual link diagrams are four valent graph embedded into @xmath3 together with a decoration of every vertex .",
    "the decorations are either _ overcrossings _ @xmath4 , _ undercrossings _ @xmath5 or _ virtual crossings _ , latter are marked with a circle .",
    "a virtual link is an equivalence class of virtual link diagrams modulo the _ generalised reidemeister moves _ in figure [ figure0 - 1 ] and isotopies .",
    "the notion of _ oriented _ virtual link diagrams and an _ oriented _ virtual links are equivalent , but latter modulo _ oriented _ generalised reidemeister moves and isotopies .",
    "we call the moves rm1 , rm2 and rm3 the _ classical moves _ , the moves vrm1 , vrm2 and vrm3 the _ virtual moves _ and the move mrm the _ mixed move_.        in this paper we are also interested in _ virtual tangle diagrams _ and _ virtual tangles_. the first ones are graphs embedded in a disk @xmath6 such that every vertex is either one valent or four valent .",
    "the four valent vertices are , like before , labeled with an _ overcrossing _",
    "@xmath4 , an _ undercrossing _ @xmath5 or a _ virtual crossing_.",
    "the one valent vertices are part of the boundary of @xmath6 and are called _",
    "boundary points_. we call a virtual tangle diagram with",
    "@xmath7 one valent vertices a virtual tangle diagram with _",
    "@xmath7-boundary points_.    a virtual tangle with @xmath7-boundary points is an equivalence class of virtual tangle diagrams with @xmath7-boundary points modulo the generalised reidemeister moves and boundary preserving isotopies .",
    "we note that every of the moves of figure [ figure0 - 1 ] can be seen as a virtual tangle diagram .",
    "moreover , examples are pictured in section [ v - tangles ] , e.g. in figure [ figure1 - 1 ] .",
    "the notions of _ oriented _ virtual tangle diagrams and an _ oriented _ virtual tangles can be defined analogous , but latter modulo _ oriented _ generalised reidemeister moves and boundary preserving isotopies .",
    "we use the short hand notation c- and v- for everything that starts with classical or virtual , e.g. c - knot means classical knot and v - crossing means virtual crossing .    if the reader is unfamiliar with the notion v - link or v - tangle , we refer to some introduction papers of l.  kauffman and v.  manturov , e.g. @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a well - known invariant of v - links is the _ virtual jones polynomial _ , i.e. an extension of the jones polynomial from c - links to v - links .",
    "moreover , m.  khovanov published in @xcite a _ categorification _ of the jones polynomial , i.e. a @xmath8-graded chain complex whose homotopy type is a c - link invariant and whose graded euler characteristic is the jones polynomial .",
    "this categorification is called _ khovanov ( co-)homology_.    the khovanov complex is a highly studied invariant of c - links .",
    "d.  bar - natan gave a cobordism based exposition of this categorification in @xcite .",
    "d.  bar - natans picture has many nice properties , e.g. it can be done _ local _ , i.e. it works for c - tangles as well .",
    "it is a natural question if the khovanov complex extents from c - links to v - links .",
    "the answer is positive , i.e. there is more then one _ categorification of the virtual jones polynomial _",
    ", one over @xmath9 given by v.  manturov in @xcite , one over @xmath10 given by v.  manturov in @xcite and one over @xmath10 using cobordisms in the spirit of d.  bar - natan in @xcite .",
    "the case of v - links is more difficult ( combinatorial ) then the classical case .",
    "that is a reason why in @xcite the d.  bar - natan approach was not extended to v - tangles .",
    "this is the main goal of the paper .    in this paper",
    "we will answer the question if the categorification extends from c - tangles to v - tangles positive , i.e. it is trivial to extend the notions over @xmath9 or in a trivial way ( by setting open saddles to be zero ) .",
    "latter has an obvious disadvantage , i.e. it is neither a `` good '' invariant of v - tangles nor can it be used to calculate bigger complexes by `` tensoring '' smaller pieces .",
    "but we give a local notion that is a strong invariant of v - tangles ( see section [ v - tangles ] ) and allows `` tensoring '' of smaller pieces ( see section [ circuit ] ) .    as an application of this construction we prove in section [ leedeg ] that the degenerations of lee s variant ( see her paper @xcite ) , i.e. that the homology in her case just `` counts '' the number of components , also extents to v - links . note that latter result is quite surprising",
    "since the complex will contain lots of @xmath11-morphisms ( our main observation is that it will also contain many isomorphisms ) .",
    "we note that , given the semi - local properties of our construction , it is possible to write a `` fast computation '' algorithm in the sense of d.  bar - natan in @xcite",
    "before we give a brief summary we recall the main ideas of the cobordism based construction of virtual khovanov homology in @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of the classical khovanov complex , e.g. the construction of the khovanov cube based on so - called _ resolutions of the crossings_. there are many good introduction to classical khovanov homology , e.g. a nice exposition of the classical khovanov homology can be found in d.  bar - natan s paper @xcite .",
    "moreover we assume that the reader is familiar with the cobordism based construction of the classical khovanonv complex of d.  bar - natan in @xcite .",
    "recall that latter involves the _ local relation _ in figure [ figure0 - 2 ] .     should be zero , a cobordism that contains a torus @xmath12 should be two times the cobordism without the torus and the four tubes relation . ]    to maintain readability , we repress in this short summary the more technical points about the construction , e.g. the placement of the signs . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that this technical points are a main reason for the length of the paper .",
    "the following table shows the connection between the classical and the virtual case .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     hence , a main point in the construction of the virtual khovanov complex is to say which saddles , i.e. morphisms , are orientable and which are non - orientable , how to place the decorations and how to place the signs .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "* every saddle either split one circle in a resolution ( orientable , called _ comultiplication _ , denoted @xmath13 .",
    "see figure [ figure1 - 2 ] - upper row , fourth morphism ) , glues two circles in a resolution ( orientable , called _ multiplication _ , denoted @xmath14 .",
    "see figure [ figure1 - 2 ] - upper row , fifth morphism ) or does not change the number of circles at all ( non - orientable , called _ mbius cobordism _",
    ", denoted @xmath15 .",
    "see figure [ figure1 - 2 ] - upper row , last morphism ) .",
    "* every saddle can be local denoted ( up to a rotation ) by a formal symbol @xmath16 ( both smoothings are neighbourhoods of the crossing ) . the _ glueing numbers _ ,",
    "i.e. the decorations , are now spread by _ choosing a formal orientation _ for the resolution .",
    "we note that the construction will not depend on the choice .",
    "* after all resolutions have an orientation , a saddle could for example be of the form @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "this is the _ standard form _ ,",
    "i.e. in this case every glueing number will be @xmath19 .",
    "* now spread the decorations as follows .",
    "every boundary component gets a @xmath19 iff the orientation is like in the standard case and a @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "the _ degenerated _ cases ( everything non - alternating ) , e.g. @xmath21@xmath18 , are the non - orientable surfaces and do not get any decorations .",
    "* there is a relation how the saddles behave if one changes the decorations .",
    "see for example figure [ figure1 - 3 ] bottom row and figure [ figure1 - 4 ] right part . because of this relations we say that @xmath14 is of type @xmath22 , @xmath13 of type @xmath23 and @xmath15 of type @xmath11 . *",
    "the signs are spread based on numbering of the circles in the resolutions and on a special x - marker for the crossings ( rather technical , see @xcite for details or definition [ defin - saddlestructure ] for a short introduction ) .",
    "a x - marker is for example pictured in figure [ figure0-main ] .    to construct the virtual khovanov complex for v - tangles we need to extend the notions above in such a way that they still work for open cobordisms .",
    "a first generalisation is easy , i.e. we will still use immersed possible non - orientable surfaces with boundary decorations , but we allow vertical boundary components , e.g. the three v - reidemeister cobordisms vrm1 , vrm2 and vrm3 cobordisms in figure [ figure0 - 3 ] .",
    "one main point is the question what to do with the _",
    "open saddles _ , i.e. saddles with no closed boundary .",
    "see bottom row in figure [ figure1 - 2 ] . a possible solution is to define them to zero .",
    "but this has two major problems .",
    "first the loss of information is big and second we would not have local properties like in the classical case ( `` tensoring '' of smaller parts ) since an open saddle can , after closing some of his boundary circles , become either @xmath14 , @xmath13 or @xmath15 . see figure [ figure0 - 4 ] .",
    "hence , an information mod 3 is missing .",
    "we therefore consider morphisms with an _ indicator _ , i.e. an element of the set @xmath24 , e.g. see figure [ figure1 - 2 ] .",
    "then , after taking care of some technical difficulties , the concept extens from c - tangles to v - tangles",
    ".    the outline of the paper is as follows .    * in section [ v - tangles ]",
    "we define the notions of a _ v - tangle ( diagram ) _ with @xmath7-boundary points .",
    "moreover , we define the geometric category we are working in and define _ two different _ versions of the virtual khovanov complex .",
    "we show in theorem [ theo - geoinvarianz ] that both are invariants of v - tangles and we show in theorem [ theo - marker ] that both versions are equal for c - tangles and v - links . * in section [ circuit ]",
    "we discuss the local properties of the construction .",
    "we define the notion of a _ decorated circuit diagram _ ,",
    "i.e. the virtual analogon of a planar diagram , and we show in theorem [ theo - semiloc ] that the construction has semi - local properties , i.e. the classical notion extents to a certain class of v - tangle diagrams .",
    "a main tool is the _ dot - calculus _ which is sketched in figure [ figure0-main ] , i.e. change the decorations iff the orientations of the input diagram and the local piece mismatch ( red dot ) , do not change them iff they match ( green dot ) and add in a bolt symbol ( non - orientable ) iff at the top and the bottom one gets a green and a red dot . * in section [ leedeg ]",
    "we show that the extension of lee s variant of khovanov homology still has the same `` degeneration '' as in the classical case , i.e. the homology just `` counts '' the number of v - link components .",
    "see theorem [ theo - leedeg ] . note that this is rather surprising since the map @xmath15 will be a @xmath11-morphism if @xmath25 is invertible .",
    "our main observation why the degeneration still holds is explained in example [ beisp - leedeg ] . in order to prove theorem [ theo - leedeg ] we use a special trick ,",
    "i.e. we define two idempotents called _ down _ and _ up _ , go to the _ karoubi envelope _ and prove that there , using the semi - local construction of section [ circuit ] , the question simplifies to the case of counting _ non - alternating resolutions_. see figure [ figure4 - 2 ] .",
    "for a v - tangle diagram @xmath26 we call @xmath27 the _ @xmath11- _ and @xmath28 the _ @xmath29-resolution _ of the crossing @xmath4 . for an oriented v - tangle diagram @xmath26",
    "we call @xmath30 a _ positive _ and @xmath31 a _ negative _ crossing",
    ". the _ number of positive crossings _ is called @xmath32 and the _ number of negative crossings _ is called @xmath33 .    for a given v - tangle diagram @xmath26 with @xmath34-numbered crossings",
    "we define a collection of closed curves and open strings @xmath35 in the following way : let @xmath36 be a word of length @xmath34 in the alphabet @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath35 is the collection of closed curves and open strings which arise when one performs a @xmath38-resolution at the @xmath39-th crossing of @xmath26 for all @xmath40 .",
    "we call such a collection @xmath35 the _ @xmath36-th resolution _ of @xmath26",
    ".    we can choose an orientation for the different components of @xmath35 .",
    "we call such a @xmath35 an _ orientated resolution_.    if we ignore orientations , then there are @xmath41 different resolutions @xmath35 of @xmath26 .",
    "we say a resolution has length @xmath14 if it contains exactly @xmath14 1-letters .",
    "that is @xmath42 .    for two resolutions",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 for one fixed @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 we define a _ saddle between the resolutions @xmath49_. this means : choose a small ( no other crossing , classical and virtual , should be involved ) neighbourhood @xmath50 of the @xmath46-th crossing and define a cobordism between @xmath35 and @xmath43 to be the identity outside of @xmath50 and a saddle inside of @xmath50 .",
    "sometimes we need a so - called _ spanning tree argument _",
    ", i.e. choose a spanning tree of a cube ( like in figure [ figure0 - 5 ] ) and change e.g. orientations such that the edges of the tree change in a suitable way , starting at leafs and remove them and repeat .",
    "note that any v - tangle diagram should be oriented in the usual sense .",
    "but with a slight abuse of notation , we will repress this orientation throughout the whole paper .",
    "recall that these orientations are needed for the shifts in homology gradings , see for example @xcite .",
    "i wish to thank v.  manturov for corrections and many helpful comments .",
    "moreover i wish to thank a.  kaestner and l.  kauffman for suggestions and helpful comments helping me to write a computer program for calculations in the future .",
    "in this section we describe how the virtual khovanov complex can be extended in such a way that it also works for v - tangles and not just for v - links .",

    "for an example see figure [ figure1 - 1 ] .",
    "there are exactly two , maybe non equivalent , closures of any v - tangle diagram . in the figure below the two closures",
