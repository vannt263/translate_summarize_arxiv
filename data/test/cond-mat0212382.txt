    "recently , the theoretical and empirical foundations of the physics of traffic flow ( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) has come into the focus of the physical community .",
    "the motion of individual cars has many peculiarities , since it is controlled by motivated driver behavior , together with some physical boundaries .",
    "nevertheless , on macroscopic scales the vehicle ensembles displays phenomena like phase formation and phase transitions widely met in physical systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "so , the cooperative behavior of cars treated as active particles seems to be of a more general nature than the mechanical laws and constructing a consistent theory of traffic flow `` from scratch '' is up to now a challenging problem .    to describe individual car dynamics a great variety of microscopic models",
    "have been proposed .",
    "these models differ in the details of the interaction between cars and the time update rule , ranging from differential equations to cellular automata  @xcite .",
    "there has been a big deal of work on the macroscopic behavior emerging from the microscopic dynamics when exploring the behavior of systems of interacting cars . however , there is still a lot of controversy in both the macroscopic behavior when compared to reality @xcite , and in the microscopic foundations of the individual car dynamics itself @xcite .",
    "one currently adopted approach to specify the microscopic governing equations of the individual car motion is the so - called social force model .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ; here only the basic ideas are touched on . at each moment @xmath0 of time , a driver @xmath1 changes the speed @xmath2 of her car depending on the road conditions and the arrangement of the neighboring cars : @xmath3 the term @xmath4 describes the motion of car @xmath1 on the empty road , whereas the term @xmath5 allows for the interaction of car @xmath6 with car @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the interaction is due to the necessity for driver @xmath6 to keep a certain safe headway distance between the cars .",
    "all the models mentioned above use various _ anstze _ for the last term .",
    "the most interesting special case , which covers the majority of all traffic flow situations , is that of single - lane traffic . here , all cars can be ordered according to their position on the road in the car motion direction @xmath9 , here @xmath10 .",
    "most models take into account solely nearest neighboring cars @xmath6 and @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 for @xmath13 and , may be , @xmath14 only . however , more complicated models exist that can be described as models with anticipation @xcite or the so - called intelligent driver model @xcite .",
    "the earliest `` follow - the - leader '' models @xcite relate the acceleration @xmath15 of car @xmath1 to the velocity difference @xmath16 only , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the characteristic time scale of the velocity relaxation . in subsequent generalizations of this model",
    "@xmath18 became a function of the car motion state , in particular , of the current velocity @xmath19 and the headway @xmath20 ( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , @xmath21 is the car length . in refs .",
    "@xcite another approach called the optimal velocity model is proposed that describes the individual car motion by @xmath22\\ , ,   \\label{int.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the steady - state velocity ( the optimal velocity ) chosen by drivers as function of the headway @xmath24 between the cars .",
    "it should be noted that this approach is related to much earlier safety distance models @xcite .    concerning the fundamentals of approximations such as @xmath25 , it is noted that there are actually two stimuli affecting the driver behavior .",
    "one of them is the necessity to move at the mean speed of traffic flow , in the given case at the speed @xmath26 of car @xmath11 .",
    "so , first , driver @xmath1 should control the velocity difference @xmath16 .",
    "the other is the necessity to maintain a safe headway distance @xmath27 depending on the current velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the `` following - the - leader '' models mainly take into account the former stimulus . the optimal velocity model , conversely , allows for the latter stimulus only .",
    "more sophisticated approximations , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite to name but a few , allow for both stimuli .",

    "@xcite used a linear _ ansatz _ for @xmath33 . later",
    "@xcite , this model was generalized to allow for the dependence of the kinetic coefficients on the motion state .    however , the question whether a collection of variables such as @xmath35 specifies the acceleration @xmath36 completely is not trivial",
    ". drivers are characterized by the motivated behavior rather than physical regularities .",
    "for example , memory effects may be essential and can destroy the direct relationship @xmath37 . up to now , memory effects in car following modelling have been treated only in a simplified version .",
    "this has been done by relating the current acceleration @xmath38 to the velocities @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the headway distance @xmath41 taken at a previous moment ( @xmath42 ) of time ( for a review of such an approach concerning with the `` following - the - leader '' models see refs .",
    "@xcite , regarding the optimal velocity model see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is the formal delay time in the driver response which is treated as a constant .",
    "such an approach , however , is rather formal , because , first , it is not clear why the memory effects relate only two moments of time instead of a certain interval as a whole .",
    "second , a simple physiological delay in the driver response as well as the mental driver estimation of the surrounding situation should contribute to the value of @xmath43 . if the latter contribution is essential the delay time @xmath43 is to depend substantially on the state of car motion .",
    "moreover , from our point of view the memory effects stem from the fact that the description of individual car motion is a boundary value problem rather than an initial value problem .",
    "indeed , at the current moment of time the headway distance and the car velocity are quantities given for the driver beforehand . correcting the car motion she should choose such a driving strategy that in a certain time interval the car velocity and headway distance attain their optimal stationary values , at least , approximately .",
    "these memory effects are the topic of this paper .",
    "we propose that drivers plan their behavior for a certain time in advance  @xcite instead of simply reacting to the surrounding situation .",
    "similar ideas related to the optimum design of a distance controlling driver assistance system are discussed in ref .",
    "mathematically , the driver s planning of the further motion is just to find extremals of a certain priority functional that ranks outcomes of different driving strategies .",
    "the derivation of microscopic governing equations for systems with motivated behavior based on a certain `` optimal self - organization '' principle has been discussed recently @xcite .",
    "the assumption adopted in these works is that individuals try to minimize the interaction strength or , equivalently , to optimize their own success and to minimize the efforts required for this .",
    "the approach discussed here applies to the concepts of mathematical economics , namely , to the notion of preferences and utility ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a specific form of the priority functional has been proposed . from that , a certain _ ansatz _ like the combined model  ( [ cm ] ) or the helly model  ( [ helmod ] ) could be _",
    "derived_. nevertheless , the question how to find the priority functional `` from scratch '' remains open .    in the present paper the priority functional",
    "is constructed by applying to general properties of the driver behavior for a simplified situation .",
    "a car following ( no overtaking allowed ) a lead car which is driven with constant speed @xmath44 is considered .",
    "the task is to derive governing equations for the following car motion specified by the time dependence of the velocity @xmath45 and the headway distance @xmath46 .",
    "assuming a driver to be able of comparing any two states @xmath47 , @xmath48 , the phase plane @xmath49 can be ordered by a preference relation @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the existence of a cost function @xmath51 may be assumed such that : @xmath52 typically , @xmath53 is called the utility function and ( for it ) the relation @xmath50 matches the inequality @xmath54 . here , the use of condition  ( [ 1.1 ] ) is preferred , because then the cost function @xmath51 is similar to the free energy of physical systems , with the minima as the stationary states .",
    "obviously , the cost function @xmath51 can not be specified completely because a composite function @xmath55 $ ] also meets condition  ( [ 1.1 ] ) for any increasing function @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "therefore , at the current stage of the theory development any approximation or _ ansatz _ adopted for the cost function @xmath51 has no meaning .    to overcome this problem and to fix a certain class of the cost functions the preference relation defined on a set of car motion paths",
    "@xmath57 is considered .",
    "a car moving from one point to another can meet different states of traffic flow .",
    "it enables one to unite various points on the phase plane in an element treated as a whole with respect to the driver preference , reducing the numerical uncertainty in their evaluation .",
    "these parts are supposed , first , to connect the same origin - destination pair @xmath58 and , second , to go through a traffic flow pattern whose structure is known to the driver beforehand .",
    "such a set obviously can be ordered by the driver preference and the corresponding cost functional @xmath59 is assumed to exist . here",
    ", only the fact that a car motion path can consist of various fragments of the phase plane is concerned with .",
    "analysis of the real car dynamics is postponed to the following section .     and @xmath60 illustrating the property of the cost functional with respect to path partitioning .",
    "letters @xmath61 and @xmath62 stand for the origin and destination points , respectively , and the symbols @xmath63 denote the local states of traffic flow.[f2],width=264 ]    figure  [ f2 ] shows two paths @xmath1 and @xmath60 which are equivalent with respect to the driver preference .",
    "they differ from each other only in the order of passing through the traffic states , @xmath64 for the path @xmath1 and @xmath65 for the path @xmath60 .",
    "it demonstrates the fact that if a path goes through a certain small neighborhood of the point @xmath66 one or many times then only the cumulative time interval @xmath67 during which the system was located in the given neighborhood contributes to the cost functional .",
    "the corresponding weight coefficient @xmath51 obviously plays the role of a certain cost function for the given traffic state .",
    "the resulting cost functional for the whole path is @xmath68dt\\ , .",
    "\\label{1.2}\\ ] ] if the driver has incomplete information about the traffic flow pattern ahead she plans the further motion only within some limits , spatial and temporal ones .",
    "this can be taken into account by introducing a certain cofactor in front of the function @xmath51 which depends on spatial coordinates or time .",
    "the initial introduction of the cost function remains the freedom of its choice too `` wide '' , as was noted above .",
    "the constructed form of the cost functional reduces this freedom substantially .",
    "namely , let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be two functions entering a cost functional similar to ( [ 1.2 ] ) with the prediction effect such that they preserve the preference relation with respect to the car motion paths on an one - lane road . then , as shown in appendix  [ appp : a ] , these cost functions are related by the expressions    @xmath71    depending on the spatial or temporal limitation in the driver prediction . here",
    "@xmath72 is an arbitrary positive constant and @xmath73 , @xmath74 are some functions of the headway distance @xmath24 or the time @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "relations  ( [ cf.4 ] ) , ( [ cf.11 ] ) specify the family of the admissible type of cost functions preserving the driver preference relation and , in addition , correspond to linear transformation of the cost functional ( appendix  [ appp : a ] ) .    for example ,",
    "@xmath75^{2}$ ] is also a cost functional .",
    "however , formula  ( [ 1.2 ] ) enables us to fix its specific form being linear with respect to time integration along car motion paths .",
    "we note that this construction conforms with regarding the motion cost as the `` physiological '' cost of driving per time , i.e. , having the meaning of a rate .",
    "both of these families possess the same freedom in choosing a specific form of the cost function especially dealing with the extremals of the cost functional .",
    "in fact , the type  ( [ cf.11 ] ) is chosen in the following .      in the following , the priority function of the car motion state with respect to the velocity @xmath34 and the reciprocal value @xmath76 of the headway distance will be characterized .",
    "note , that the value @xmath77 is not the real car density on a highway .",
    "the present analysis ignores the car length , so we have preferred to use the value @xmath77 defined as above .",
    "the most preferable state is the motion on an empty road ( @xmath78 ) at maximum speed @xmath79 .",
    "this maximum speed is determined by external factors .",
    "so , at @xmath80 the cost function @xmath81 has its global minimum : @xmath82 set equal to zero keeping in mind the aforesaid about the freedom in specifying the cost function . since there is no other minimum for the motion on an empty road,@xmath83 can be fixed .",
    "because of the car construction a driver can visually control the headway distance within some value @xmath842  m. when the headway distance @xmath24 attains such values a driver has to stop her car because of possible collision even at sufficiently slow velocities .",
    "so , @xmath85 coincides with the characteristic headway distance in dense jams where the car density attains the possible maximum . in the following ,",
    "all headway distances are related to the scale @xmath85 and the dimensionless variable @xmath86 is used .",
    "when not moving at all ( @xmath87 ) and the density of cars surrounding the given car does not come close to the limit values , i.e. , @xmath88 , it does not matter how many cars are located in the vicinity .",
    "so the assumption that at @xmath87 and for @xmath89 the cost function is independent of @xmath77 can be used : @xmath90 in all other cases , @xmath91 depends on certain combinations of @xmath77 and @xmath34 rather than on @xmath77 individually , at least when @xmath92 .    considering the behavior of @xmath91 for a fixed speed @xmath34",
    "it can be stated that driving with small values of @xmath24 ( large values of @xmath77 ) requires a lot of effort .",
    "thus , @xmath91 increases with @xmath77 .",
    "the opposite case of small values of @xmath77 ( large values of @xmath24 ) deserves special attention . without the possibility of overtaking no especially attractive headway distance",
    "can be marked .",
    "therefore , we assume that the cost function @xmath93 possesses the only one minimum attained at the boundary point @xmath94 provided the velocity @xmath34 is fixed .    keeping in mind the aforesaid it is reasonable to write @xmath95 for @xmath96 . here",
    "the exponent @xmath97 is a constant and the function @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "since the cost function attains its minimum at the boundary point we may set @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the latter term on the right - hand side of exp .",
    "( [ 1.6na ] ) can be interpreted as a certain `` interaction '' potential between the following and lead cars which is long - distant one for @xmath100 . a detailed analysis of effects caused by the value of the exponent @xmath97 requires an individual study .",
    "here the value @xmath101 is actually chosen as just a simple reasonable assumption . since the effect of the surrounding cars is depressed for small values of the car velocity @xmath34 the function @xmath102 is also to attain its minimum at @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 as @xmath105 should hold . in other words , inside a certain neighborhood of the origin",
    "@xmath106 the following expansion @xmath107 can be adopted .    ) .[f3 ] ]    taking into account these speculations about the behavior of the cost function @xmath108 caused by variations of both its arguments , the following simple _ ansatz _ will be used subsequently : @xmath109 figure  [ f3 ] displays this function .",
    "it has only one global minimum at @xmath78 and @xmath110 . for a fixed velocity @xmath34 it attains a local minimum at the boundary @xmath78 .",
    "_ ansatz _  ( [ 1.7 ] ) generalizes the adopted assumptions about the cost function .",
    "the former term takes into account relations  ( [ 1.3 ] ) , ( [ 1.4 ] ) , the latter one is based on approximation  ( [ 1.6n ] ) .",
    "of course , the parabolic _ ansatz _  ( [ 1.7 ] ) is approximate only in the limit @xmath111 .",
    "since this is the main region of interest , this does not constrain its usefulness . to deal with the car dynamics",
    "we should construct the cost functional @xmath112 for the car motion paths @xmath113 treated now as continuous functions of time @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the time dependence of headway distance @xmath46 gives us the complete information about the car dynamics due to the relationship @xmath114 .",
    "leaping ahead , we say that facing this problem it is necessary to introduce additional notions .",
    "first , we should expand the phase space in describing the car motion state because transient processes are now the subject of consideration .",
    "second , drivers plan their behavior for a certain time in advance instead of simply reacting to the surrounding situation .",
    "so we should specify the region inside which a driver can monitor the traffic flow evolution and , thus , plan driving her car .",
    "a priority functional similar to eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) must span the time interval corresponding to this region .",
    "beyond it the contribution of the path fragments to evaluating the car motion quality at the given moment of time has to be fairly minor .",
    "dealing with transient processes in the car motion we should consider once more the collection of phase variables characterizing the cost of car motion at the current moment of time .",
    "keeping in mind conventional driver experience , we will expand the current state of car motion given by headway @xmath24 and velocity @xmath34 with the car acceleration @xmath115 .",
    "this is essential because a driver can not change the position and velocity of her car immediately , they vary continuously in time and contain no sharp jumps .",
    "conversely , a driver controls the acceleration directly governing the car motion . besides , she can change the acceleration practically without delay because in the present analysis it is quite reasonable to ignore time scales related to physiological properties of the driver or to the mechanical properties of the car .",
    "so , the cost function @xmath116 for the motion state @xmath117 can be written : @xmath118 where the time scale @xmath119  s characterizes the acceleration capability of the car . in writing",
    "this expression we have assumed that driving without acceleration is preferable .",
    "then , the cost function @xmath120 had been expanded into a taylor series with respect to @xmath115 , keeping the leading term only . according to the result to be obtained the time scale @xmath121 entering expression  ( [ 2.1 ] ) and the one used in equation  ( [ cm ] ) are practically the same .",
    "it should be noted that confining ourselves to expansion  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with respect to @xmath115 the difference between acceleration and deceleration processes has been lost . in reality , they are different . ignoring this difference leads to models where cars can crash .",
    "it is possible to take into account this effect using the approach under development , which , however , is worthy of individual investigation and will be done somewhere else .     and",
    "its relationship with the limit angle of perception @xmath122.[f4 ] ]    for a real driver , various thresholds in the driver recognition of hazards and obstacles exist @xcite .",
    "one of them is the distance @xmath123 at which a driver can recognize the behavior of other objects .",
    "this distance is usually related to the threshold of the visual angle @xmath122 subtended , for example , by vehicles ahead ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . the value of @xmath122 can be estimated as @xmath12430  min of arc @xcite . the critical angle @xmath122 , the characteristics height @xmath125 of cars , and the corresponding mean distance @xmath123 are related by @xmath126 this allows for the estimation of the recognition distance as @xmath127400  m setting @xmath128  m and @xmath12915  minutes of arc .",
    "as previously  @xcite , we relate the driver anticipation with the region of size @xmath123 in front that is clearly observable and where she can recognize the car behavior .",
    "a driver plans her motion based on the information received by monitoring traffic flow inside the observable region . under normal conditions",
    "this region should enable her to govern the motion effectively , for example , to decelerate in advance avoiding a possible accident . therefore its size @xmath123 has to meet the inequality @xmath130 .",
    "leaping ahead , we introduce the value @xmath131 treated as a small parameter in the theory to be developed . in particular , for @xmath132  s , @xmath133  km / h , and @xmath134  m we have @xmath135    the size @xmath123 of the recognition distance can be estimated using another argumentation .",
    "if @xmath136  s is the typical deceleration time from the velocity @xmath79 attained on the given empty road to zero value then the estimate @xmath137 should hold . for @xmath138",
    "km / h we have again @xmath139  m. now the cost functional of car motion can be written in an integral form as expression  ( [ 1.2 ] ) containing the integrand  ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "the car is assumed to be located at point @xmath140 along the road and to move with speed @xmath34 at the current moment @xmath0 of time .",
    "the possible paths of further motion @xmath141 form the set @xmath142 on which the cost functional is defined .",
    "here and below gothic letters will be used to label the path variables .",
    "the function @xmath143 allows for a derivation of all the dynamical variables , the headway distance @xmath144 , the car velocity @xmath145 , and the acceleration @xmath146 of the trial car path .",
    "the cost functional evaluating the quality of the path @xmath143 can be written as    @xmath147      \\mathcal{f}^d(\\mathfrak{h},\\mathfrak{u},\\mathfrak{a})\\,d\\mathfrak{t}\\,,\\\\ \\intertext{or }      \\mathcal{l}\\{\\mathfrak{h}\\ } & =      \\int_t^\\infty \\exp\\left[-\\frac{v}{\\lambda}(\\mathfrak{t}-t ) \\right ]      \\mathcal{f}^d(\\mathfrak{h},\\mathfrak{u},\\mathfrak{a})\\,d\\mathfrak{t}\\ , .",
    "\\label{2.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    forms  ( [ 2.4n ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) correspond to the driver prediction with spatial or temporal limitations , respectively .",
    "the cost functional of form  ( [ 2.4n ] ) was used in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , functional  ( [ 2.7 ] ) is used because its form simplifies the mathematical manipulations when the velocity @xmath44 of the lead car is fixed .",
    "in particular , dealing with functional  ( [ 2.7 ] ) we can specify directly the set of trial paths @xmath148 using solely the time dependence of @xmath149 of the headway distance .",
    "the path variables @xmath150 , @xmath151 are completely determined by the dependence @xmath149 : @xmath152 furthermore , the cost functional  ( [ 2.7 ] ) matches the driver prediction with temporal limitation , the mechanism which also allows for the interpretation of the recognition region size in terms of @xmath153 .",
    "however , both of the cost functionals lead practically to the same results for the analyzed situation .",
    "each one of trial paths originates at time @xmath0 and starts from @xmath154 on the phase plane determined by the headway distance and velocity of the car at the current time @xmath0 .",
    "since we investigate the car motion inside traffic flow but not processes of leaving it we assume that time variations @xmath46 of the headway distance are bounded .",
    "therefore the trial paths fulfil @xmath155 and do exhibit bounded variations only as time goes to infinity .",
    "in other words , there is a constant @xmath156 with @xmath157    in what follows , the driver behavior will be described by the extremals of the cost functional  ( [ 2.7 ] ) . using the standard variational technique and taking into account conditions  ( [ 2.5 ] ) , ( [ 2.6 ] ) the governing equation for these extremals",
    "can be derived : @xmath158    to study the spectral properties of eq .",

    ", these divergent eigenfunctions describe the process of a driver leaving traffic flow , for example , to stop the car .",
    "such processes are not under consideration . the former pair of eigenvalues are given by : @xmath167^{\\tfrac{1}{2}}.      \\label{2.804}\\ ] ] so , in a small neighborhood of the stationary point @xmath159 of equation  ( [ 2.8 ] ) any extremal @xmath168 can be written as @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are some constants .    equation  ( [ 2.8 ] ) is of fourth order , so its general solution is specified by four conditions .",
    "solutions that diverge as time goes to infinity have to be omitted ( they are related to @xmath165 ) .",
    "their divergence is due to the exponential cofactor in integral  ( [ 2.7 ] ) so it is retained beyond a small neighborhood of the stationary point @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , only two conditions are needed to specify the desired solution of eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the initial headway distance @xmath24 and the car velocity @xmath34 determine it completely .",
    "the latter statement can also be proved for the more general form  ( [ 2.4n ] ) of the cost functional @xcite .       containing the current time @xmath0 as its argument .",
    "so the found optimal paths @xmath168 depend on the time @xmath0 when the driver plans the further motion .",
    "the right panel presents the ideal case where the driver is able to evaluate the motion cost precisely and the corresponding cost function @xmath173 does not contain the time @xmath0 .",
    "so , the optimal path family degenerates into one curve .",
    "it should be noted that the latter is correct even if the time @xmath174 enters the cost function via variations of the lead car velocity .",

    "should be described ( fig .",

    "a variational approach to the description of car dynamics has been developed in case of a car following a lead car moving at a constant speed . to derive governing equations for the following car motion",
    "the driver preference has been used to construct a cost functional .",
    "its extremals specify the optimal paths of the further motion for the following car . applying to the general properties of the driver behavior we analyzed the basic properties of the cost function and proposed a simple parabolic _ ansatz _ , which , nevertheless , catches typical features of traffic properties .",
    "the concept of a rational driver is formulated .",
    "it comprises the assumptions that the driver follows the optimal paths and corrects the car motion continuously . in this case",
    "the optimal path is a nash equilibrium of the system , which is defined as follows .",
    "if the driver has chosen an optimal path at a certain moment of time then no further correction of the car motion is necessary because it leads to the same result . as the consequence of the nash equilibrium the extremals of the cost functional",
    "specify the real dynamics of cars with rational drivers although originally they determine only the imaginary paths in the driver s mind when planning the further motion . in this way we obtained several results .",
    "the optimal velocity approximation has been derived .",
    "the weight coefficient entering a car following model combining the `` following - the - leader '' model and the optimal velocity model has been found depending on the headway distance . as an important result",

    "first , we have shown that there can be two types of the car relaxation towards the stationary motion , the mono - scale dynamics and the `` fast - and - slow '' dynamics .",
    "second , we singled out the quasi - free motion and the dense traffic mode .",
    "the variational technique for the latter mode can be simplified essentially .",
    "namely , it is possible to reformulate the cost functional so that it does not contain a time dependent cofactor . as a result",

    "in particular , different conservation laws for this stages have been found .",
    "a generalized principle of adequate car motion control has been proposed .",
    "we assumed that the lead car moves at a fixed speed .",
    "if it is not the case two different situations should be singled out . for perfect drivers who can predict rigorously the motion of the car ahead the main results still hold .",
    "otherwise the cost function will depend not only on the current time but also , what is crucial , on the time when the driver has started to evaluate the further car dynamics .",
    "this disturbs the nash equilibrium and the car correction should be carried out continuously .",
    "briefly this problem was studied in  @xcite but it actually requires a more detailed investigation .",
    "real drivers have certain limitations .",
    "they are not capable of finding the optimal path precisely and they can not correct the car motion continuously .",
    "so , the concept of rational driver behavior is just the first approximation of the real situation and deviations from this perfect behavior should be analyzed consistently .",
    "a first step towards this problem can be found in ref .",

    "( [ br.1 ] ) by parts , assuming @xmath369 , and dropped terms like @xmath370 where ever possible .",
    "when the driver plan her further motion the current values of the headway @xmath24 and the velocity @xmath34 are regarded as the initial conditions .",
    "so , when choosing the optimal path she can minimize only the first term @xmath371 of expression  ( [ br.2 ] ) .",
    "this optimization is implemented through the adequate control over the car acceleration @xmath115 , so , exactly the acceleration plays the role of the control parameter available for the driver actions .",
    "a real driver can only approximately evaluate the quality of motion .",
    "let us describe the threshold in the driver perception of the motion quality by @xmath372 where @xmath373 is a small constant , @xmath374 , because definitely a driver can recognize the difference in the state of staying and freely motion on an empty road .",
    "when the controllable part @xmath375 of the cost motion is much smaller then the threshold  ( [ br.4 ] ) the driver actually has no information of how to govern the car motion . in this case",
    "it is natural to assume that he will not do anything with respect to the car driving and , so , will fix the car motion at the current state , including the current acceleration @xmath115 . thereby the inequality @xmath376 determine the region in the phase space @xmath295 inside which the driver can not control the car motion . in evaluating such a driver behavior with expression  ( [ br.2 ] ) we can formally treat @xmath377 , @xmath378 , and @xmath379 as constants independent of one another . so setting @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 and taking into account the relation between @xmath196 and @xmath44 we get from condition  ( [ br.5 ] ) the approximate boundary of this region in the following form @xmath383 we recall that the parameter @xmath214 entering eq .",
    "( [ lge ] ) coincides with @xmath384 .",
    "so we reproduced here the expression for the rational driving boundary as has been introduced in paper  @xcite by a different line of reasonings .",
    "these investigations were supported in part by rfbr grants  01 - 01 - 00389 , 00439 , ur grant  01.03.005/2 , intas grant  00 - 0847 , and russian program `` integration '' project  b0056 , during a stay of one of the authors ( il ) at the institute for transport research of the german aerospace centre .",
    "a set @xmath385 of one - dimensional paths @xmath386 of car motion is considered .",
    "all the paths are supposed to originate from one point @xmath387 at the initial time @xmath388 , i.e. @xmath389 , and to go to infinity , @xmath390 , as @xmath312 such that the car velocity @xmath391 is bounded during the motion , @xmath392 ( here @xmath62 is some constant ) .",
    "it is assumed that the set @xmath385 is ordered by a certain preference relation @xmath393 and there is a functional @xmath394 of the form @xmath395 measuring numerically the preference relation , i.e. meeting the condition @xmath396 here , first , the integrand @xmath397 depends on the car position on the road @xmath398 , the velocity @xmath45 , and , may be , the current moment @xmath0 of time .",
    "it plays the role of cost function , i.e. evaluates the quality of the car motion state at current time .",
    "second , the weight factor takes one of the forms @xmath399 where @xmath400 and @xmath401 as @xmath402 or @xmath403 . the functions @xmath404 and @xmath405 describe the spatial or temporal limitations in the driver prediction , respectively .",
    "the examples @xmath406 where @xmath407 and @xmath44 are some constants , enable us to relate the cost functional  ( [ appp1 ] ) to ones used in the main text . the specific form of @xmath404 and @xmath405",
    ", however , does not affect the results to be obtained in this appendix .",
    "let @xmath408 be another cost functional of form  ( [ appp1 ] ) with its own integrand @xmath409 that also describes the same preference relation .",

    "is divided into classes @xmath410 of equivalent paths , i.e. @xmath411 if @xmath412 or , what is the same , @xmath413 .",
    "the cost functional @xmath414 based on the integrand @xmath409 has to preserve this class partition .",

    "let us show that the value of @xmath425 is constant for _ all _ the points of the phase plane .",
    "the cost functions @xmath409 , @xmath397 are chosen , thereby , if the _ quasi - local _ equation  ( [ appp4 ] ) holds , the value of @xmath426 must be determined by any fragment of the path @xmath398 under consideration , for example , by a fragment @xmath427 . for @xmath428 and @xmath429",
    "any point @xmath430 can be joined to the fragment @xmath431 by a certain path @xmath432 which must be characterized by the same value of @xmath425 .",
