    "one of the greatest challenges of particle physics is to understand the dynamics and mass spectra of hadrons in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and a concept of diquarks  quark - quark bound states  has been playing an important role towards these goals . for example , diquark - quark models of baryon @xcite are used to reproduce the mass spectra , the decay rates , the magnetic moments , the ratio of the axial - vector coupling to the vector coupling , the charge radius , and the processes of deep - inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "another example is phenomenology of recently confirmed exotic hadrons @xmath0 , etc .",
    "it is proposed that a diquark - antidiquark description of such exotic hadrons can explain observed properties of those states , especially the narrow width and decay properties @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a functional method using the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation with the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation has been considered to have no diquark bound - state solutions . in the case of mesons , a consistent scheme which preserves the nambu - goldstone nature of pions",
    "is established for the extensively used rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation @xcite and its extension @xcite , and the resulting bs eq .",
    "has bound - state solutions in both truncations .",
    "however , in the diquark channel of the bs equation , a certain kind of beyond - rl contributions have been found to remove the bound - state solutions @xcite , in contrast to the rl truncation @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the differences among previous studies @xcite which make the diquark bound - state solutions absent , and propose another approximation scheme in which diquark bound - state solutions exist . to this end",
    "we employ the same qcd model as refs .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the munczek - nemirovsky model @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this model enables one to take higher loop diagrams into the bs kernel @xcite , leading the previous studies to find that a certain crossed ladder diagram gives a large repulsive contribution in the diquark bs equation due to its enhanced color factor @xcite .",
    "we point out that this enhancement is not peculiar to the diagram considered in these studies , but common among a class of diagrams  the completely crossed ladder diagrams .",
    "then we perform a resummation of these diagrams adopting large-@xmath1 counting as a criteria for the truncation @xcite , finding bound - state solutions to the diquark bs equation .",
    "although our calculation is based on a specific model with a specific truncation scheme , we believe that our result is at least a counterexample of the previous arguments that the bs eq . has no solutions in the diquark channel .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_dse ]",
    ", we introduce the ds eq . for quarks , and explain the model we adopt .",
    "next in section  [ sec_bse ] , we introduce the bs eq . for mesons and diquarks , and discuss the type of diagrams which give the leading contribution to the bs kernel .",

    "dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations are functional relations @xcite which are derived from a functional change of variables in the path integral in a modern point of view .",
    "they include information on non - perturbative effects in principle , and provide us a useful way to study the infrared behavior of qcd . the ds eq . of the quark propagator",
    "takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dressed quark propagator , @xmath4 the quark self - energy , @xmath5 the dressed gluon propagator , @xmath6 the dressed quark - gluon vertex , @xmath7 the bare mass of the current quark , @xmath8 the generator of su(3)@xmath9 , the gluon momentum @xmath10 , @xmath11 is su(3)@xmath9 gauge coupling constant , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the renormalization factors of the quark - gluon vertex and the quark propagator , respectively . the general form of the dressed quark propagator is given as @xmath14 the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath15 is omitted for simplicity .",
    "here we use the euclidian metric and the gamma matrices satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "the dressed quark propagator is renormalized by the following condition : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the current quark mass at the scale @xmath15 .",
    "equation becomes a self - consistent equation of the quark propagator @xmath3 when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are modeled as some known functions of @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "this method can realize large quark mass at low energy , which is considered to be a consequence of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the munczek - nemirovsky model @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionful parameter which determines the scale of this model .",
    "in addition , the projection operator @xmath24 becomes @xmath25 due to the spherical symmetry of the model . in this model ,",
    "the three - point vertex of gluon vanishes because of its derivative coupling property , but the four - point vertex still remains . here and in what follows , we assume that the effects of the gluon self - coupling interactions are not crucial for the calculation of the bound - state mass .",
    "the validity of this assumption is not obvious especially when we consider large-@xmath1 counting since vertex corrections due to these interactions are known to be enhanced in the large-@xmath1 counting @xcite .",
    "we consider that the assumption is partially supported by the success for reproducing meson mass spectra in this setup as shown in refs.@xcite and in table [ tab_bound ] of this paper .",
    "we take the renormalization scale @xmath15 to be large enough ( @xmath26 gev ) , and we can set the renormalization constants to @xmath27 and need not to specify the regularization scheme in the practical calculation since the model has no uv divergence .",
    "the dimensionful parameter @xmath28 can be fitted to reproduce the observed mass spectrum well , and the value @xmath29 gev is found to satisfy this requirement @xcite . the @xmath30-function behavior in eq .",
    "is considered to be a realization of the property of hadrons dominated by the infrared dynamics of quarks and gluons inside them . here",
    "the infrared region means the energy scale smaller than @xmath31 .    in the munczek - nemirovsky model ,",
    "the self - consistency equation becomes simple algebraic equations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and thus can easily be solved once the self - energy @xmath4 is specified .",

    "the quark propagator functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are evaluated by solving eq .   with the self - energy eq .  , and",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig_dse ] .",
    "we take the current quark mass to be @xmath37 [ gev ] in the plot , which is consistent with previous studies . with this choice , we obtain reliable masses of pion and rho mesons if we set @xmath29 gev ( see table  [ tab_bound ] ) .",
