    "fidelity is a standard benchmark in quantum information , and plays a relevant role in discussions on quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fidelity amplitude can be interpreted as the overlap between two wave functions obtained from the propagation of the same initial state with two different time evolutions or , alternatively , as the overlap of the initial state with itself after being propagated forward in time with one evolution and backward in time with the other . in the latter case one",
    "often speaks of loschmidt echo .",
    "fidelity contains information on both eigenfunctions and spectra of the original and perturbed systems in a non - trivial way .",
    "one can show , however , that there exists a profound relation @xcite between fidelity decay and purely spectral universal parametric correlations @xcite in chaotic and disordered systems .",
    "the connection holds in quite general settings @xcite .",
    "efforts to measure fidelity are therefore very important .",
    "there was an early proposal ( without the name fidelity ) in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "along these lines the perturbation of a kicked rotor was discussed in great detail @xcite .",
    "a realization of that idea is not available today , although an experiment of this type , but with a more complicated process , was conducted @xcite .",
    "experiments with microwave cavities or elastic bodies seem to provide good options to study the decay of fidelity @xcite , but a difficulty arises .",
    "fidelity implies an integration over the entire space . in two - dimensional microwave billiards",
    "the antenna always represents a perturbation , and thus moving the antenna defeats the purpose of a fidelity measurement , as the wave - function taken at any point is that of a slightly different system .",
    "in contrast to wave function measurements , in fidelity experiments we are precisely interested in such differences , and thus wave functions measured with moveable antennas @xcite or a moveable perturbation body @xcite are not appropriate . in elastic experiments on solid blocks @xcite or three - dimensional ( 3d ) microwave billiards the wave function inside the volume seems to be inaccessible anyway @xcite .",
    "this leads to the development of the concept of scattering fidelity @xcite which tests the sensitivity of @xmath1-matrix elements to perturbations .",
    "this is also of intrinsic interest since the scattering matrix may be considered as the basic building block at least in the case of quantum theory @xcite .    in former studies",
    "the scattering fidelity has been investigated in chaotic microwave billiards by considering a perturbation of the billiard interior .",
    "it can be shown that in such a case the random character of wave functions causes the scattering fidelity to represent the usual fidelity , provided that appropriate averaging is taken @xcite .",
    "scars and parabolic manifolds will obviously change that correspondence , but their effect can be avoided in experiment .",
    "specifically , two different types of interior perturbations were experimentally studied . in the first set of experiments a billiard wall",
    "was shifted , realizing the so - called global perturbation @xcite , meaning that there is a total rearrangement of both spectrum and eigenfunctions already for moderate perturbation strengths .",
    "good agreement with prediction from random matrix theory ( rmt ) , expecting gaussian or exponential decay depending on perturbation strength , was found . in the second experiment",
    "a small scatterer was shifted inside the billiard , the wave function being influenced only locally @xcite . using the random plane wave conjecture ,",
    "an algebraic decay was predicted and confirmed experimentally .",
    "actually , any measurement opens the system .",
    "coupling to the continuum changes drastically the system properties by converting discrete energy levels into unstable resonance states .",
    "the latter reveal rich dynamics when the coupling strength to the scattering channels is varied @xcite , see also @xcite for relevant microwave studies .",
    "since the time evolution operator is subunitary in this case , there appears the leakage of the norm inside the scattering system @xcite .",
    "this decay is fully controlled by the degree of system openness and may also be considered as a remote analog of fidelity decay for open systems . in the framework of the scattering fidelity coupling to the continuum can be taken into account naturally .",
    "it seems therefore attractive to study the sensitivity of @xmath1-matrix elements to perturbations in the coupling between the scattering system and decay channels",

    "this complements previous experiments of our group , where the fidelity decay under the influence of various types of geometrical perturbations was studied @xcite but for closed systems exclusively .",
    "to get rid of an overall absorption we used the concept of scattering fidelity introduced by us previously @xcite , defined as the parametric cross - correlation function of @xmath1-matrix elements normalized to the corresponding autocorrelation function .    on the theoretical side we have developed a model description of the fidelity decay in terms of a modified vwz approach .",
    "the parametric cross - correlation function of @xmath1-matrix elements for two different @xmath139 can be reduced to an autocorrelation function with a complex effective transmission coefficient [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : teff ] ) ] , thus expressing coupling fidelity in terms of a modified vwz integral .",
    "this theory holds for an arbitrary number of channels and describes the experimental coupling fidelity results well .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate , whether it is possible to relate coupling fidelity obtained via the vwz ansatz to an approximation using the random plane wave conjecture , as used to explain the local fidelity @xcite .",
    "we have found two additional important result .",
    "first , a smooth variation of the coupling , e.g.  by varying the coupling to an attached wave guide will not easily yield the information about the effect of coupling to the continuum on the scattering fidelity .",
    "each geometric variation will give rise to both a change of coupling and internal scattering properties , thus screening the purely external effect , as is also discussed in appendix  [ app : exp ] .",
    "second , we have included closed channels within the description of vwz .",
    "the speed of the fidelity decay for the open - end and hard - wall reflection oscillates with frequency due to the corresponding variation of the phase with frequency . an important relation ( [ eq : s15 ] ) between the coupling constants of the antenna terminations has been established , enabling us to connect the results found for the closed channel ( @xmath118 , @xmath117 ) to those for the open channel ( @xmath134 ) . in all cases",
    "the fidelity decay for at least one of the reflecting antennas is faster than for the open channel , showing the strong influence of the imaginary part on the coupling constant @xmath44 .",
    "one of us ( d.v.s . ) is grateful to i.  smolyarenko for useful discussions of the results .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the generous hospitality of cic ( cuernavaca , mexico ) during our stay there at the program rmt - mex09 , where this work has been partly completed .",

    "in our first approach we used the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] where the opening of the variable slit plays the role of the fidelity parameter .",
    "the setup is based on a quarter sinai shaped billiard with length @xmath140 , width @xmath141 and a quarter - circle of radius @xmath6 , and an attached channel .",
    "the channel has a total length @xmath142 and a width @xmath143 . at position @xmath8 and @xmath7",
    "two antennas were fixed and connected to the vna .",
    "the complete @xmath1-matrix was measured in a frequency range from @xmath144 to @xmath145 with a resolution of @xmath11 , where the wave guide only supports a single propagating mode , i.e.  it acts as a single channel .",
    "the perturbation of the system was achieved by opening the channel from @xmath146 mm in steps of 0.1 mm using a slit diaphragm at the point of attachment .",
    "an ellipse insert with semiaxis @xmath147 and @xmath148 mm was rotated to get an ensemble of 20 different systems for averaging .",
    "additional elements were inserted into the billiard to avoid bouncing - ball resonances .",
    "the wave guide was terminated by a perfect absorber , which according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : s13 ] ) should correspond to a purely imaginary coupling . as before the coupling constant @xmath104",
    "could be determined directly from a reflection measurement at antenna @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath104 could be varied from @xmath149 ( no coupling ) to @xmath150 ( perfect coupling ) by increasing the opening @xmath151 of the slit .",

    "the frequency window of the fourier transform of the measured @xmath159 was 13 to @xmath160 and the transmission coefficient for antenna @xmath8 was @xmath161 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] the coupling fidelity decay is shown for two different perturbation strengths .",
    "the solid lines show the experimental results . with the formulas derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we calculated the expected theoretical fidelity decay assuming that the channel is totally open , i.e.  the coupling is purely imaginary ( dotted lines ) .",
    "there is obviously no agreement .",
    "this shows that something is wrong in the argumentation . for a further check we removed the absorbing end and the antenna in the channel and replaced it by a reflecting end thus closing the system .",
    "we did not find any noticeable difference to the case with the absorbing end and the antenna in the channel experimentally .",
    "so there is only one explanation : by far the major part of the wave is reflected directly at the slit , and only a minor part really penetrates into the channel .",
    "this means that the coupling is not imaginary but mainly real ( up to perhaps a minor imaginary contribution ) , and we should use eq .",

    "( [ eq : s13 ] ) for the interpretation of our results . the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig:05 ]",

    "( [ eq : s14 ] ) . now a perfect agreement between experiment and theory is found .    as a resume we can state that the variable slit works essentially as a scattering center leading to partial masking of the change of coupling by the change of scattering properties in the fidelity decay .",
    "the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ss_ft ] ) proceeds along the same lines as in @xcite , hence we indicate below only the main steps and essential differences .",
    "first , we make use of the representation of resolvents and thus @xmath1-matrix elements [ eq .  ( [ eq : s_cc1 ] ) ] in terms of gaussian integrals over auxiliary `` supervectors '' consisting of both commuting and anticommuting ( grassmann ) variables .",
    "this allows us to perform statistical averaging over goe exactly .",
    "then in the rmt limit @xmath38 , the remaining integration over the auxiliary field can be done in the saddle - point approximation .",
    "it turns out that there exists a nontrivial saddle - point manifold @xcite over which one has to integrate exactly . as a result",
    ", the two - point correlation function of the @xmath1-matrix elements in the energy domain acquires the form of a certain expectation value in field theory ( nonlinear supersymmetric @xmath162-model ) , @xmath163e^{\\mathcal{l}(\\varepsilon)}\\mathcal{f}_{m}(\\cdots)$ ] , cf .",

    "the pre - exponential terms omitted above depend on the coupling constants in the channels @xmath8 and @xmath169 ( @xmath51 ) , being thus the same as considered in @xcite .",
    "they finally correspond to the expressions appearing explicitly in eqs .",

    "its typical behavior is @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is for the present case of time - invariant systems whereas @xmath181 is for the case of broken time invariance ( gue ) .",
    "the case of the coupling variation in the channel @xmath7 amounts then to replacing in this expression @xmath69 with @xmath71 .",

    "we stress , however , that there is no control on approximations involved to derive this expression .",
    "one should generally expect that surmise ( [ eq : app2 ] ) coincides closely with the exact result at small times ( when it is given by an exponential dependence ) , while the exact asymptotic behavior at large times is reproduced up to a factor of the order of unity ( as was indeed confirmed numerically ) .",

    "( [ eq : ss_ft ] ) , since it is finally canceled due to the normalization in definition ( [ eq : f_ab ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in the case of the pure imaginary @xmath183 , i.e.  a closed channel , expression ( [ eq : app1 ] ) is reduced to the action derived in @xcite for the case of localized perturbations in closed systems , @xmath184 being then expressed in terms of the reactance matrix of the scattering centre ."
