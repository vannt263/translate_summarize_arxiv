    "[ sec : intro ]    the collapsar model @xcite was originally proposed as an explanation for common , `` long - soft '' gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with durations near 20 s. this is a typical time scale for the gravitational collapse of the carbon - oxygen core of a massive star and the congruence of these time scales was an argument in favor of the model .",
    "it is well known , however , that forming a disk so quickly requires an unusually large amount of angular momentum to be stored in the core up to the point when the star dies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is presumably one reason why grbs are rare compared with supernovae .",
    "black holes are expected to form in a significant fraction of massive star deaths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it seems possible that , in at least some of these , the black hole will form without generating an outgoing shock . what observable signal would accompany such an event ?",
    "would they all be `` un - novae '' @xcite , stars that simply suddenly disappear from view ? or will some sort of transient display announce the birth of any black hole ? here",
    "we explore the possibility that these black hole systems form an accretion disk , but only after almost all of the star has accreted into the hole .",
    "torques in differentially rotating contracting stars tend to concentrate angular momentum in the star s outer layers .",
    "the surface will also have a large angular momentum in a tidally locked system . on the other hand",
    ", stellar mass loss preferentially removes these same layers , so , just as in the usual collapsar model , reducing mass loss , e.g. , by reducing the metallicity , favors the retention of high angular momentum at the stellar surface .    because the outer layers of the star take longer to fall in - months to years in the case of a red supergiant -",
    "the duration of the transient produced by accretion through a disk in these cases is much longer than for the common grbs studied so far .",
    "they might even be confused with other forms of gamma - ray transients like those arising from super - massive black hole accretion in active galaxies @xcite .    here",
    "we shall consider four varieties of long duration transients categorized by the kind of system where they occur : 1 ) single supergiants with metallicity less than about @xmath4 and low mass loss (   [ sec : bsg ] ) ; 2 ) red or blue supergiants in tidally - locked , or nearly tidally - locked binaries (   [ sec : rsg ] ) ; 3 ) pair - instability induced collapse to a black hole (   [ sec : pair ] ) ; and 4 ) helium stars in tidally locked binaries (   [ sec : helium ] ) . in each case , the duration of the transient that is produced is correlated with the radius of the presupernova star , hence shortest for the helium stars , while the luminosity is inversely correlated with the radius , hence faintest for the red supergiants . as with common grbs , we are unable to predict _ ab initio _ the spectrum of these transients or the efficiency for converting black hole accretion rate into electromagnetic radiation . presumably , as in other forms of transients powered by very rapidly accreting , rotating black holes , accretion energy and black hole spin energy power relativistic bi - polar outflows .",
    "poynting flux , shocks within these outflows , and shocks with the circumstellar medium make x - rays and gamma - rays .",
    "it is common to take an efficiency of @xmath5 to @xmath6 times @xmath7 for the efficiency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) thus suggesting an integrated power of @xmath8 per solar mass accreted .",
    "interestingly these `` failed supernovae '' @xcite are far more brilliant and powerful than their ( model - wise ) more successful cousins , ordinary supernovae .    the idea that late time accretion in supernovae that make black holes might power long gamma - ray ( or hard x - ray ) transients",
    "was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the transients discussed there , referred to as `` type 2 collapsars '' , were produced because of fall - back in an explosion that launched a relatively strong outgoing shock in a red supergiant progenitor .",
    "two dimensional models explored jet propagation and break out for a variety of fall - back rates , but little attention was given to the angular momentum distribution necessary to form a disk . here we consider a wider variety of progenitors and pay closer attention to the angular momentum , especially in the outer layers .",
    "@xcite also discussed the possibility of very - long duration x - ray transients powered by fall back and accretion through a disk .",
    "he suggested these might look like `` ultra - luminous x - ray sources '' seen in nearby galaxies . these would be much longer in duration ( thousands of years ) and have much lower luminosity than the events considered here , but are an example of the same general idea .    more recently @xcite and @xcite suggested that fallback or a failed explosion in a red supergiant could give a long duration gamma - ray transient that might be confused with a gamma - ray blazar .",
    "quataert and kasen , in particular , suggest this as an alternate interpretation of swift transient sw-1644 + 57 @xcite .",
    "woosley s paper was accepted prior to the discovery of this event .",
    "a variety of other models may lead to long duration bursts .",
    "for example a white dwarf @xcite or helium star merging with a black hole or neutron star @xcite . a neutron star or black hole merging with a a giant star might give a thorne - zytkow object @xcite or a black hole accreting at a rapid rate @xcite .",
    "helium star merger with a compact object also gives a long transient of some sort @xcite .",
    "here we consider only those transients coming from stars that are not actively merging with a companion .",
    "[ sec : black ]    a black hole will form inside a massive star when a sufficient concentration of matter and energy accumulates to form an event horizon .",
    "the simplest possibility is that some portion of a massive star experiences an instability and falls freely , or almost freely , until it reaches such a high density that a trapped surface is formed .",
    "this rarely happens in nature though . only in the most massive stars experiencing a pair instability @xcite or a general relativistic instability @xcite can a trapped surface form before the center reaches nuclear density and bounces .",
    "that is , black hole formation in a massive star is almost always preceded by protoneutron star formation @xcite .    for stars in the range @xmath9 ,",
    "however , the protoneutron star that is formed experiences rapid accretion from the surrounding layers of heavy elements - silicon , oxygen , etc .",
    "if rotation , magnetic fields and neutrinos do not readily produce an outgoing shock , the hot protoneutron star grows beyond a critical mass and collapses to a black hole . the accretion rate is larger for more massive helium cores @xcite , and",
    "black hole formation without an outgoing shock may be a frequent occurrence in stars with main sequence masses over about @xmath10 @xcite . whether _ all _ stars above about @xmath10 produce black holes without outgoing shock waves is uncertain , but the possibility is not precluded by observations or theory",
    ". `` prompt ''",
    "black hole formation is probably more likely in very low metallicity stars that have experienced little mass loss and thus have especially large helium cores , but it could occur for solar metallicity stars , depending upon the uncertain mass loss rate @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that such a weak outgoing shock is generated that most of the star fails to explode and a black hole is made by fall back @xcite .",
    "these were the systems explored by @xcite .",
    "the ones treated here differ in assuming that any outgoing shock is insufficient to eject more than a small fraction of the surface layers of the star .",
    "we shall call such events , where only the surface layers have enough rotation to form a disk and a shock so weak that these layers are not ejected `` type 3 collapsars '' .",
    "this is to distinguish them from ordinary grbs where the disk forms promptly from material deep inside a highly differentially rotating helium core ( type 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from systems where longer duration transients result from the delayed fall back of other material also deep inside the star ( type 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ sec : stars ]    the preservation of angular momentum in the surface layers of the star can occur either because mass loss is inefficient in a single star or because of tidal interaction with a close companion .",
    "here we consider examples of both sorts .",
    "[ sec : bsg ]    a paucity of metals in a star affects its evolution in several ways - reduced energy generation by the cno cycle in the hydrogen burning shell , reduced opacity , and reduced mass loss . of these effects",
    ", the reduction in mass loss is least well understood , but the lack of atomic lines in the atmosphere on the main sequence and of grains as a red giant seems certain to lead to some reduction .",
    "a common assumption is that the mass loss for massive main sequence stars depends upon some fractional power of the metallicity @xcite . more important and less certain",
    "is the dependence of mass lost as a red or blue supergiant on metallicity .",
    "it is thought that mass loss from cool giants is more dependent upon pulsations and grain formation @xcite .",
    "one might expect therefore a rapid fall off in mass loss below some value necessary for significant grain production .",
    "it has been estimated that red giant mass loss will be significantly less below @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "if stars do not lose mass then they conserve angular momentum .",
    "since the natural course of evolution leads to the contraction and spin up of the inner star , shear instabilities and magnetic torques will concentrate an increasing amount of angular momentum in the outer regions of the star .",
    "whereas the inner part does spin faster due to contraction , it actually loses most of its initial angular momentum by the time it reaches central carbon burning .",
    "@xcite surveyed the evolution of non - rotating zero - metal massive stars from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . in a parallel study currently underway @xcite",
    ", we are surveying the evolution of rotating stars in the same mass range with metallicity @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 that of the sun .",
    "the two stars discussed here are extracted from that survey and are typical in the way that they accumulate large amounts of angular momentum in their outer layers before dying as supergiants .",
    "all calculations of stellar evolution presented here used the kepler code @xcite and included angular momentum transport by magnetic torques @xcite .",

    "both stars rotated rigidly on the main sequence with a moderate speed of about @xmath19 which is about @xmath20 of the keplerian value .",
    "both presupernova stars had hydrogenic envelopes that were , throughout most of their mass , radiative .",
    "model v36 , however , had a low mass surface convection zone that included @xmath21 .",
    "model v36 was consequently a yellow supergiant at death ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) .",
    "model v24 was a rather large blue supergiant ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ) .",
    "these two stars ended their lives with cores of helium and heavy elements of @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively and angular momentum distributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsg ] . whereas the lack of sufficient angular momentum within the helium core precludes making a disk around a black hole within that mass",

    "this could be a very common occurrence . from the survey of @xcite , the total angular momentum of a massive star at birth that has an equatorial rotation speed of about @xmath20 keplerian on the main sequence is @xmath30",
    "if the star does not lose mass , most of this angular momentum becomes concentrated , in the presupernova star , in a nearly rigidly rotating hydrogenic envelope with radius either @xmath31 ( blue supergiant ) or @xmath32 ( red supergiant ) . whereas the density declines with radius in the actual envelope",

    "these can be compared with the angular momentum required to make a disk around a non - rotating black hole , @xmath39 or @xmath40 for a maximally rotating hole ( kerr parameter @xmath41 ) .",
    "all massive stars that do not lose mass have sufficient angular momentum in their outermost layers to make a disk around any black hole formed in their collapse .",
    "of course stars do lose mass and the fact that , for constant @xmath42 , @xmath43 means that the first mass to be lost contains most of the angular momentum . in practice , we find that a red supergiant that loses more than a few percent of its total mass before dying will probably not make a black hole - disk system .",
    "this sensitivity to mass loss is illustrated by the evolution of a @xmath44 model , o25 , with @xmath6 solar metallicity in a calculation that included mass loss at one - half the standard value for that metallicity .",

    "a stellar merger could lead to a rapidly rotating envelope @xcite , but such mergers probably lead to ejection of a common envelope .",

    "the mass of the envelope that is convective at any one time , however , is only about @xmath66 and the star loses more than this in its lifetime .",
    "a more appropriate time scale might be the time the star spends losing its last @xmath66 , which is about @xmath67 .",
    "the mass of the star when it becomes a supernova is @xmath52 and we assume a companion mass of , e.g. , @xmath68 .",
    "the luminosity of the star as a red supergiant is @xmath69 and its moment of inertia is approximately @xmath70 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : circ ] ) then implies that during its last @xmath67 , orbits with radius @xmath71 will circularize .",

    "longer period systems will still transfer significant rotation to the envelope , however .",
    "this is about four orders of magnitude more angular momentum in the outer envelope than in the case of the single star .",
    "since the outer several solar masses of the presupernova star is convective , this rotation rate will persist to some depth .",
    "all of that mass would have sufficient angular momentum to form an accretion disk if its helium core collapsed to a black hole . even then though",
    ", the total angular momentum of the envelope , @xmath80 , would be a small fraction of the orbital angular momentum of the binary pair of stars .",
    "the addition of only @xmath5 of the angular momentum estimated here would still result in large quantities of material forming a disk , so the range of binary separations allowed is actually larger , perhaps by a factor @xmath81 , or about two .",
    "since the time scale for material to fall in from @xmath82 is longer than any realistic viscous time scale for the disk , the accretion rate will be given by the collapse timescale of the envelope .",

    "whereas the focus here is on red supergiants because they give the longest transients , tidal locking would also occur in blue supergiants with smaller radii .",
    "the key point is that forced co - rotation with a body in keplerian orbit gives , for a large range of orbital separations , envelope material that is rotating too fast to accrete , without hindrance , into a stellar mass black hole .",
    "since the time scale for accretion is set by the collapse time for the outer part of the star , not the viscous time of the disk , a transient from a tidally locked blue supergiant would be similar in duration within a factor of a few to those studied for single blue supergiants in   [ sec : bsg ] .",
    "blue supergiants , however , will have less mass in the outer layers of the envelope and hence should have less powerful outbursts ( appendix  [ sec : append ] and @xcite ) .",

    "unless it is very rapid and highly differential , does not change this mass limit greatly since the instability exists in the deep interior where the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity is small .",

    "unlike in @xcite however , none of these helium cores had sufficient angular momentum to make a disk around a black hole anywhere in their interior . because mass loss was neglected in these models , the angular momentum lost from the helium core due to magnetic coupling instead ended up concentrated in the outer part of the hydrogen envelope .",

    "rotationally induced mixing , the envelopes of all three models were appreciably enhanced in c , n , and o and thus were red supergiants when they died . neglecting mass loss in such a situation is probably not justified .",

    "that is the rotation rate of the surface layers was allowed to adjust to be consistent with whatever angular momentum was transported to them . without mass loss ,",
    "the star was forced to conserve angular momentum overall and the very outer layers ended up rotating very rapidly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binaryjfin ] ) . the angular speed , rather than being @xmath140 was @xmath141 .",
    "in fact the outer tenth of a solar mass rotated so rapidly that it would be centrifugally ejected . in a realistic calculation , this matter and more underlying matter would probably have been ejected as a disk or a centrifugally boosted wind .",
    "the deep interior still lacked sufficient angular momentum to form a disk around a black hole , but the amount of surface material that could form a disk ( if mass loss did not remove it ) was significant , about 2 @xmath142 , comparable to that in model 8b .",
    "two other models like 8c were calculated that included mass loss appropriate for a wolf - rayet star at solar metallicity and one - tenth that value .",
    "the first ended up with a final mass of @xmath143 and no surface layers with sufficient angular momentum to form a disk .",
    "the second ended up with a mass of @xmath144 and still had enough angular momentum in its outer solar mass to make a disk .",
    "so the major role of the close companion in the calculations done here is to preserve the angular momentum in the outer layers that might otherwise be removed by mass loss .",
    "a companion may also be essential so that the helium core rotates rapidly in the first place , following the loss of the star s hydrogen envelope .",
    "when magnetic torques are included in the calculation , the helium cores of supernova progenitors that are red and blue supergiants rotate too slowly for any portion of that core to make a disk .",
    "a close companion could either preserve angular momentum in the core by removing the envelope very early in the evolution or add angular momentum by tidal locking later on .",

    "[ tab : models ] @xmath145 is the amount of mass capable of forming a centrifugally supported disk around a black hole with a kerr parameter given by accreting all the mass interior to @xmath145 and @xmath59 is the range of stellar radii where that mass exists . the accretion time scale has been estimated using the radius for the center of mass of @xmath145 . the luminosity has been estimated by multiplying the effective accretion rate ( mass / time scale ) by @xmath146 .",
    "this assumes @xmath6 efficiency for making a jet and @xmath6 efficiency for converting jet energy into hard radiation .",
    "most models produce extreme kerr black holes ( @xmath41 , table  [ tab : models1 ] ) , so the radiative efficiencies may be higher than assumed here @xcite .",
    "the numbers in the table are only order of magnitude estimates .",
    "table  [ tab : models1 ] gives the the estimated pulsar period formed in the stellar collapse assuming the angular momentum that exists in the inner @xmath129 of the core , a final gravitational mass of @xmath130 , and a moment of inertia of @xmath147 @xcite . if a black hole forms before the protoneutron star has radiated away most of its gravitational binding energy , the rotation rate will be slower as will the rotational kinetic energy available for explosion . @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the masses of the presupernova star and its helium core respectively and @xmath150 is the lagrangian mass coordinates of the stellar layers that can form a centrifugally supported disk .",
    "the kerr parameter , @xmath151 , is what would develop if the entire presupernova , including its rapidly rotating outer layers , collapsed to a black hole . in case where it exceeds unity",
    "it has been capped at @xmath152 .",
    "the kerr parameter for the helium core alone is @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath154 is the net binding energy , in units of @xmath155 , of the material that could form a disk .",
    "a range of masses can form disks and a large range of time scales characterize the accretion , hence the possible luminosities span many orders of magnitude .",
    "the shorter brighter transients from wolf - rayet stars in tidally locked binaries might comprise an interesting subset of long , but otherwise ordinary grbs , as others have noted .",
    "this channel could be especially important in regions where high metallicity and high mass loss preclude the production of grbs by solitary stars .",
    "the mass of @xmath156ni produced in the collapsar model is sensitive to the temperature , density , time scale , and ejection fraction of the disk and is difficult to estimate .",
    "the lower accretion rate , larger black hole mass , and smaller kerr parameter for the models presented here , however , will give lower temperatures and densities in the disk @xcite .",
    "below about @xmath157 , the nature of the accretion changes and the disk is no longer neutrino dominated .",
    "a thicker disk might qualitatively change the nature of the transient ( macfadyen , private communication ) .",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that the @xmath156ni production , per solar mass of material accreted , will be different here and perhaps much smaller .",
    "these bursts might not be accompanied by supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the longer end , blue and red supergiants will produce transients of order @xmath158 and @xmath159 respectively .",
    "these could result from either tidally locked systems or more distant systems with low metallicity and mass loss .",
    "these fainter and potentially more common systems may not have been detected yet and certainly should be searched for .",
    "they could easily be confused with flaring gamma - ray blazars @xcite , but would differ in that they only happen once and would be associated with regions of massive star formation , not particularly galactic nuclei .",
    "they too would probably not be accompanied by supernovae and might have a different beaming factor and spectrum from ordinary grbs .",
    "the black holes produced in these supergiant progenitors would frequently be rotating at near the maximum value ( fig .  [",
    "fig : bsg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rsg ] ) .",
    "an exciting prospect is that the first generations of stars , those with metallicities from zero to @xmath160 solar might be studied directly using the hard x - rays they emit when they die . whereas predictions are still clouded by the vagaries of mass loss and the explosion mechanism ,",
    "our studies predict that the fraction of massive stars emitting such bursts could be substantial , essentially limited only by the fraction that make black holes promptly .",
    "if none make black holes promptly , then the death of every massive star must make a supernova , though perhaps a faint one .",
    "this too is an interesting possibility worth further exploration .    because of their long duration and potentially high event rate , it is possible that several type  3 collapsars will be visible in distant galaxies at any one time .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath161 core - collapse supernovae occur each year in a field of view @xmath162 in the redshift range @xmath163 .",
    "this is about @xmath164 supernovae per second spread over the whole sky .",
    "the observation of grbs beyond redshift @xmath165 shows that massive stars were dying at an even earlier time .",
    "black hole formation probably occurs in a significant fraction of these supernovae @xcite , perhaps all those with mass over @xmath10 and metallicity less than @xmath6 solar . in order to estimate , crudely",
    ", an event rate , assume that prompt black hole formation occurs in @xmath6 of core collapses and @xmath5 of these stars either have such low mass loss rates or close companions that their outer layers make a disk .",
    "then @xmath18 of all massive star deaths would make type  3 collapsars . for low metallicity stars",
    ", the latter could be an underestimate .",
    "the universal supernova rate of @xmath164 per second then implies a gamma - ray transient event rate of @xmath166 per second .",
    "if each event lasted @xmath158 , there would @xmath167 events in progress at all times .",
    "most of these would be at high redshift ( low metallicity ) and the spectrum would be softer and duration longer than in the lab frame , so the number of active sources could be higher .",
    "on the other hand , beaming could increase the brightness and decrease the event rate significantly .    in an extreme limiting case where @xmath6 of all massive star deaths made type  3 collapsars with duration @xmath159 with negligible beaming",
    ", one would have @xmath168 active sources at any one time , or about @xmath152 per square degree .",
    "if each source radiated @xmath169 , this could potentially contribute to a `` diffuse '' cosmological background of soft gamma - rays .",
    "the greatest uncertainty in these results is whether the matter with high angular momentum will get ejected , by mass loss either before the explosion or during the explosion , without falling to the center of the star .",
    "as table  [ tab : models1 ] shows , the binding energy of the critical material is very much less than the kinetic energy of a typical supernova ( @xmath170 ) , so a weak explosion or even strong pulsations during silicon burning could eject it .",
    "it seems unlikely that this would happen all of the time in all sorts of models , so perhaps this enters in chiefly as a major uncertainty in the event rates .",
    "we also note that the converse problem , the optical appearance of a `` supernova '' exploding with only @xmath171 of kinetic energy is an interesting one too .",
    "one way or another , it seems unlikely that these stars will all disappear without a trace .",
    "the authors appreciate valuable discussions with christian ott regarding core - collapse in massive stars and with ron taam on tidal interaction in close binaries . this research has been supported by at ucsc by the national science foundation ( ast 0909129 ) and the nasa theory program ( nnx09ak36 g ) .",
