    "( [ efunc ] ) is exactly that of the schrdinger equation if there are no limitations on the hilbert space spanned to search for the minimum of the energy functional . in our approach",
    "we search for the minimum within a subspace composed by states of the form @xmath1 is a slater determinant , formed by a set of orthonormal single particle wave functions , and @xmath2 is a many  body correlation function .    the quantities to be compared to the experiment are calculated by evaluating the mean value of the corresponding operators between the states of eq .",
    "( [ ansa1 ] ) fixed at the minimum of the energy functional : @xmath3 where we have indicated with @xmath4 a generic operator associated to an observable .",
    "a good variational ansatz for realistic calculations requires that the correlation function @xmath2 has the same operatorial dependence of the hamiltonian . in this report , however , we assume that the many  body correlation is a scalar function which can be written as a product of two - body correlation functions : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance between the nucleons @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the choice ( [ cormany ] ) of the correlation function leads to the following expression for the energy functional : @xmath9 & = &   \\frac { \\langle\\phi_0 |h \\prod_{i < j}^a f^2(r_{ij } )    { \\langle\\phi_0|\\prod_{i",

[ 1+h(r_{23 } ) ] ... |\\phi_0\\rangle }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation we have used the function @xmath10 to show the mechanism of the cluster expansion .",
    "the simplest term is the mean value of the hamiltonian between two uncorrelated states , which is obtained by picking up all the `` ones '' in the various terms in eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) .",
    "more complicated terms are obtained considering a single @xmath11 function multiplying the `` ones '' .",
    "the procedure continues considering terms with two , three , etc .",
    "@xmath11 functions .",
    "we make a classification of the various terms based upon their topology . with the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) technology",
    "we calculate all the terms of a certain type .",
    "details of the application of the fhnc to the description of the ground state of doubly closed shell nuclei can be found in refs .",
    "the recent progresses of these calculations , done with state dependent correlations , are presented in another contribution to this conference @xcite .",
    "in the theoretical framework we have presented , the evaluation of an operator mean value , eq .",
    "( [ ave ] ) , requires the use of the full fhnc computational scheme . for the evaluation of the one  body density distribution , defined as @xmath13 we have developed a simplified model @xcite . after performing the cluster expansion of both numerator and denominator to eliminate the so - called unlinked diagrams",
    ", we retain the terms with a single correlation function @xmath14 .",
    "the expression for the density obtained in this approximation is : @xmath15_l \\phi_0({\\bf r}_1, .... ,{\\bf r}_a)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subindex @xmath16 indicates that only the linked diagrams have to be calculated .",
    "the diagrams representing the terms considered in our model are shown in fig .",

    "the white circles represent the point @xmath17 which is not integrated , the black circles the points @xmath18 and @xmath19 which are integrated in eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) , the dashed line the function @xmath11 and the oriented lines are related to the single particle wave functions .    the density calculated in our model is correctly normalized .",
    "this can be seen considering that , since the uncorrelated term , corresponding to the diagram @xmath20 of fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] , is already correctly normalized , the contribution to the normalization of the other terms should be zero . in the diagrammatic picture of fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] the integration on @xmath17 transform in black the white dot . since in the three point diagrams @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the figure the white circles are not reached by the correlation line @xmath23 , the integration implies that the single particle wave functions connected to these points should be the same .",
    "therefore the contribution of the diagram @xmath21 cancel that of the diagram @xmath24 as well as the contribution of the diagram @xmath22 that of the diagram @xmath25 .",
    "we checked the validity of our model by comparing the density distributions we have obtained with those produced by a fhnc calculation .",

    "the comparison between the results of the fhnc calculation and those of our model is done in fig .",
    "the one  body densities are compared in the upper panels for calculations done with both kinds of correlations .",
    "the agreement between the result of the two calculations is very good . since the one  body densities are the diagonal part of the density matrix , in order to test our model also on the off diagonal part of this matrix , the comparison with the full calculation has been done also for the momentum distributions .",

    "the description of nuclear responses in the quasi  elastic region is based upon the approach developed by fantoni and pandharipande @xcite and applied to nuclear matter .",
    "the basic ansatz consists in assuming that the nuclear excited states can be described as a product of a slater determinant and a many  body correlation function which is the same correlation function describing the ground state : @xmath28 indicates a slater determinant which differs from @xmath29 by the fact that a certain number of hole single particle states have been substituted with particle wave functions .",
    "the many  body nuclear response at energy @xmath30 and momentum transfer @xmath31 to a an external field @xmath32 can be written as : @xmath33 where the sum is understood to run on all the nuclear excited states .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ resp ] ) requires the calculation of the full cluster expansion @xcite .    like in the case of the density distribution , instead of performing the full expansion , after the elimination of the unlinked diagrams , we consider only the terms containing a single correlation function @xmath11 .    in the case",
    "the nuclear final state is characterized by one particle above the fermi surface , the matrix element to be calculated are of the kind : @xmath34 where we have indicated with @xmath35 the slater determinant where the hole single particle wave function @xmath14 has been substituted by the particle wave function @xmath36 .    if the @xmath4 operator is the charge operator , eq .",
    "( [ 1p1h ] ) represents , in the limit for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the normalization condition of the density .",

    "the effect of the inclusion of the three point diagrams has opposite sign with respect to that of the two points diagrams .",
    "this fact is not surprising since , in the normalization of the charge , the contribution of the the three points diagrams cancels exactly that of the two points diagrams .",
    "the finite size effect do not modify this conclusion as one can observe in the three right panels of the figure .",
    "the calculation of the transverse response has been done by considering only the one - body magnetization current .",

    "points diagrams has opposite sign with respect to that of the two - points diagrams .",
    "we observe that the final response is extremely close to the uncorrelated response .",
    "the different behavior with respect to the case of the longitudinal response is produced by the fact that , for the nuclear matter transverse response , the diagrams @xmath21 and @xmath39 of fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] do not contribute .",
    "this is strictly true only for the infinite system . in finite systems ,",
    "only the diagram @xmath40 is zero .",
    "the right panels of fig . 7 show that this is the main responsible for the different behavior of the correlations in the longitudinal and the transverse response .",

    "[ rl2ph ] we show the longitudinal 2p-2h responses for three different values of the momentum transfer .",
    "the dashed lines have been obtained considering only the two points diagrams , while the full lines show the results obtained considering both two and three points diagrams .",
    "also in this case the contribution of the three - points diagrams is relevant , close to the 40% for some value of the excitation energy .",
    "it is necessary to remark that the absolute value of the response is three order of magnitude smaller than the 1p-1h response .",

    "we have developed a model to describe nuclear responses taking into account short  range correlations . we have shown that mean values of the density operator can be calculated with minimal error by using a cluster expansion truncated up to the first order terms in the function @xmath11 .",
    "this truncation should be properly done to maintain the correct normalization of the wave function .",
    "this implies that both two and three points diagrams should be considered .",
    "we have shown that in both 1p-1h and 2p-2h responses the quantitative contribution of the three - point diagrams is relevant and can not be simulated by multiplying the responses by a constant renormalization factor .",
