    "since its discovery in 1974 @xcite , the charmonium system has become the prototypical ` hydrogen atom ' of meson spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the experimentally clear spectrum of relatively narrow states below the open - charm dd threshold of 3.73  gev can be identified with the 1s , 1p and 2s levels predicted by potential models , which incorporate a color coulomb term at short distances and a linear scalar confining term at large distances .",
    "spin - dependent interquark forces are evident in the splittings of states within these multiplets , and the observed splittings are consistent with the predictions of a one gluon exchange ( oge ) breit - fermi hamiltonian , combined with a linear scalar confining interaction .",
    "discussions of the theoretical importance and experimental status of heavy quarkonium , including recent experimental results for charmonium , have been given by quigg @xcite , galik @xcite , the cern quarkonium working group @xcite , seth @xcite and swarnicki @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a resurgence of interest in charmonium , due to the realization that b factories can contribute to the study of the missing states @xcite , and to high - statistics experiments at bes @xcite and cleo @xcite and the planned gsi @xmath3 facility @xcite .",
    "the possibility of contributions from b factories was dramatically illustrated by the recent discovery of the long missing @xmath4 @xmath5 state by the belle collaboration @xcite , which has since been confirmed by babar @xcite , and has also been observed by cleo in @xmath6 collisions @xcite .",
    "additional interest in spectroscopy has followed the discovery of the remarkable x@xmath7 by belle @xcite and cdf @xcite in b decays to @xmath8 ; assuming that this is a real resonance rather than a threshold effect , the x@xmath7 is presumably either a dd@xmath9 charmed meson molecule @xcite or a narrow @xmath10 d - wave state @xcite .",
    "very recent observations of the x@xmath7 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 by belle support a @xmath13 dd@xmath9 molecule assignment @xcite .",
    "there has also been experimental activity in the spin - singlet p - wave sector , with recent reports of the observation of the elusive @xmath14 @xmath15 state by cleo @xcite .",
    "finally , the surprisingly large cross sections for double charmonium production in @xmath16 reported by belle @xcite suggest that it may be possible to study c @xmath17 @xmath0 states in @xmath16 without using the higher - order @xmath18 two - photon annihilation process .",
    "one open topic of great current interest in spectroscopy is the search for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 states , which are expected to be quite narrow due to the absence of open - charm decay modes .",
    "a second topic is the lorentz nature of confinement ; in pure models this is tested by the multiplet splittings of orbitally - excited states .",
    "for example , with pure scalar confinement as is normally assumed there is no spin - spin hyperfine interaction at o@xmath21 , so the masses of spin - singlets ( such as the @xmath22 @xmath15 ) are degenerate with the corresponding triplet c.o.g .",

    ", at 3525  mev . in the original cornell model",
    "@xcite it was assumed that confinement acts as the time component of a lorentz vector , which lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath15 and the @xmath1p@xmath23 c.o.g .",
    "another possibility is that confinement may be a more complicated mix of scalar and timelike vector @xcite .",
    "of course these simple potential model considerations may be complicated by mass shifts due to other effects , such as couplings to open - flavor channels @xcite .",
    "a third topic is the search for exotica such as hybrids ; the level of mixing between conventional quarkonium and hybrid basis states falls rapidly with increasing quark mass , which suggests that nonexotic hybrids may be more easily distinguished from conventional quarkonia in charmonium than in the light quark sectors . since lgt ( lattice gauge theory ) predicts that the lightest hybrids lie near 4.4  gev @xcite , there is a strong incentive to establish the  background \" spectrum of conventional states up to and somewhat beyond this mass .",
    "a final topic of current interest is the importance of mixing between quark model @xmath24 basis states and two - meson continua , which has been cited as a possible reason for the low masses of the recently discovered d@xmath25 states @xcite .",
    "the effects of  unquenching the quark model \" by including meson loops can presumably be studied effectively in the system , in which the experimental spectrum of states is relatively unambiguous .",
    "the success of the @xmath24 quark model is surprising , in view of the probable importance of corrections to the valence approximation ; the range of validity of the naive  quenched \" @xmath24 quark model is an interesting and open question @xcite .",
    "motivated by this revived interest in spectroscopy , we have carried out a theoretical study of the expected properties of charmonium states , notably the poorly understood higher - mass levels above dd threshold .",
    "two variants of potential models are used in this study , a conventional nonrelativistic model based on the schrdinger equation with a coulomb plus linear potential , and the godfrey - isgur relativized potential model .",
    "we give results for all states in the multiplets 1 - 4s , 1 - 3p , 1 - 2d , 1 - 2f and 1 g , comprising 40 resonances in total .",
    "predictions are given for quantities which are likely to be of greatest experimental interest , which are the spectrum of states , e1 ( and some m1 ) electromagnetic transition rates , and strong partial and total widths of states above open - charm threshold .",
    "similar results for many of the electromagnetic transition rates have recently been reported by ebert _",
    "the @xmath26 leptonic and two - photon widths are not discussed in detail here , as they have been considered extensively elsewhere ; see for example @xcite and @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "as a minimal model of the charmonium system we use a nonrelativistic potential model , with wavefunctions determined by the schrdinger equation with a conventional quarkonium potential .",
    "we use the standard color coulomb plus linear scalar form , and also include a gaussian - smeared contact hyperfine interaction in the zeroth - order potential . the central potential is v_0^(c|c)(r ) = - + br + _ ( r ) _ c _ |c where @xmath27 .",
    "the four parameters @xmath28 are determined by fitting the spectrum .",

    "we treat the remaining spin - dependent terms as mass shifts using leading - order perturbation theory .",

    "details of the model and the method of solution may be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of a relativistic kinetic term and a generalized quark - antiquark potential , = h_0 + _ q|q ( , ) where _ 0 = +  . just as in the nonrelativistic model ,",
    "the quark - antiquark potential v@xmath39 assumed here incorporates the lorentz vector one gluon exchange interaction at short distances and a lorentz scalar linear confining interaction .",

    "note that the string tension and quark mass ( @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and @xmath45 gev ) are significantly larger than the values used in our nonrelativistic model .",
    "one important aspect of this model is that it gives reasonably accurate results for the spectrum and matrix elements of quarkonia of all @xmath46 quark flavors , whereas the nonrelativistic model of the previous section is only fitted to the system .",
    "the spectra predicted by the nr and gi models ( table  [ table_spectrum ] and fig .  [ spectrum ] ) are quite similar for s- and p - wave states , largely because of the constraints provided by the experimental candidates for these multiplets .",

    "radiative transitions of higher - mass charmonium states are of interest largely because they provide one of the few pathways between states with different quantum numbers .",
    "since typical e1 radiative partial widths of charmonia are 10s to 100s of kev , corresponding to significant branching fractions of @xmath61 to @xmath62 , large event samples of radially excited s - wave states produced in @xmath16 annihilation could be used to identify radially excited p - wave states , which are not otherwise easily produced .",
    "similarly , the e1 radiative transition of the nominally 2@xmath1d@xmath48 @xmath51 can be used to produce an f - wave state ; this multiplet would likely be very difficult to reach using other mechanisms .",

    "some e1 transitions that are of special importance for the study of higher charmonium states are discussed in the text .",
    "transitions from initial @xmath74 states are of greatest interest in this regard , since these can be studied with high statistics at @xmath16 machines",
    ". these can provide access to the spin - triplet members of the 2p and 3p multiplets in particular , starting from the @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "although m1 rates are typically rather weaker than e1 rates , they are nonetheless interesting because they may allow access to spin - singlet states that are very difficult to produce otherwise .",
    "it is also interesting that the known m1 rates show serious disagreement between theory and experiment .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that m1 transitions between different spatial multiplets , such as @xmath80 ( 2s @xmath81 1s ) , are nonzero only due to small relativistic corrections to a vanishing lowest - order m1 matrix element .",

    "although the m1 decay rates involve a relatively simple off - diagonal matrix element of the magnetic moment operator , we note that our predicted rates show considerable variation with the model assumptions , and agreement with the two known m1 rates is not good . in the off - diagonal ( 2s",
    "@xmath81 1s ) transition @xmath80 this is because the zeroth - order m1 matrix element vanishes due to orthogonality of the spatial wavefunctions , and the nonzero predicted rate results from rather model - dependent corrections to the wavefunctions and recoil effects .",
    "evidently the corrections we have included do not accurately predict the observed partial width ; for this reason the other predicted m1 rates between different spatial multiplets are suspect , and in any case are evidently strongly dependent on recoil factors .",

    "a very important test of this strong decay model and the nature of the @xmath75 follows from a simple measurement of the ratios of the three independent d@xmath9d@xmath9 decay amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath187 model predicts that the @xmath245 amplitude is zero , and the ratio of the two p - wave amplitudes is @xmath246 , independent of the radial wavefunction , provided that the @xmath75 is a pure s - wave state .",
    "similarly , the d@xmath9d@xmath9 amplitude ratios in @xmath51 decays test the decay model and the assumed @xmath247 assignment for this state .",
    "the @xmath245 d@xmath9d@xmath9 amplitude is predicted to be the largest for a pure @xmath247 @xmath51 , and the p - wave amplitude ratio is predicted to be @xmath248 , again independent of the radial wavefunction .",
    "finally , we noted that it may be possible to identify a higher - l state ( the @xmath249 @xmath232 member of the f - wave multiplet ) in e1 radiative @xmath51 decays .",
    "the @xmath76 has ten open - flavor modes , and their branching fractions have never been determined .",
    "we predict that the largest is the unusual s+p combination dd@xmath48 .",
    "it is especially notable that strong decays of the @xmath76 may provide a novel production mechanism for the enigmatic @xmath250 , through the above - threshold decay @xmath251 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4415_scan ] .",
    "one may also produce higher - mass charmonium states from the @xmath76 through electromagnetic transitions .",
    "for example , @xmath76 e1 decays are predicted to produce 3p states with branching fractions at the per mil level .",
    "these states could then be identified through their subsequent open - charm strong decays .    as discussed in section v.c , two new states near 3940  mev",
    "have recently been reported by belle .",
    "2p @xmath79 states are natural assignments , as they have theoretical quark model masses ranging from 3852 to 3972 mev and widths of 50 - 100 mev , similar to the reported values .",
    "a  measurement of the relative branching fractions to @xmath252 , @xmath151 and @xmath146 and comparisons to our @xmath1p@xmath2 decay model predictions should allow the determination of the quantum numbers of these states , and will show whether they are indeed consistent with 2p @xmath0 assignments .",
    "a better determination of the properties of conventional charmonium states at higher masses is important not only because of the improved understanding of qcd that will follow ( especially aspects of confinement and strong decays ) , but also because qualitatively different types of resonances are expected at these masses .",
    "these new states include charmed meson molecules and charmonium hybrids , and the identification of these novel excitations will obviously be easier if the conventional charmonium spectrum is well established .",
    "the recent results from b factories and new programs at bes , cleo and gsi have led to a resurgence of interest in the physics of charmonium .",
    "we argue that a detailed experimental investigation of the spectrum of excited charmonium states and their decay properties will considerably improve our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of qcd .",
