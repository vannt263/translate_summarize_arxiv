    "recent loophole free tests @xcite of bell inequalities have firmly established that certain correlations of quantum states can not be explained by a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model .",
    "bell @xcite had demonstrated that correlations in a local - realistic theory must obey an inequality  bell inequality .",
    "he considered a simple situation of two spin-@xmath1 particles in a singlet state and showed that quantum mechanics is not compatible with local - realistic theories .",
    "since then , this result has been generalized in many different directions @xcite . in the simplest scenario ( two parties , two measurement settings and two outcomes per setting ) , all bell inequalities are equivalent to the clauser - horner - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "this is because chsh inequality is the only nontrivial facet of bell polytope for such a scenario @xcite .",
    "according to gisin s theorem @xcite , all pure bipartite entangled states violate this inequality .",
    "the maximum allowed expectation value of chsh operator for a quantum system is @xmath2 .",
    "this bound is known as the tsirelson s bound @xcite .",
    "however , the violation of a bell inequality is only sufficient criteria for certifying entanglement but not a necessary one . even in the case of two - qubit states",
    ", there is a phenomena of hidden nonlocality , which is typified by werner state @xcite .",
    "however this phenomena occurs for mixed states .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider pure multipartite states .",
    "unlike a pure bipartite state , the relationship between bell nonlocality and entanglement is far from simple @xcite . for three - qubit states , we will adopt following terminology .",
    "a state @xmath3 is a pure separable or product state if it can be written in the form @xmath4 , a pure biseparable state if it can be written as @xmath5 or in other permutations and is genuinely entangled if it can not be written in a product form . above classification",
    "is based on types of entanglement present in the state .",
    "idea of non - separability according to bell locality comes from the inability of construction of a lhv model for observed correlations . in this case",
    ", the quantum mechanical description is not presupposed . for a system of three particles ,",
    "if the joint probability can be written as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the probability of yielding the result @xmath8 , when a measurement @xmath9 is done on the particle containing the local hidden variable @xmath10 , then the model is called the well known lhv model .",
    "the intermediate case is the hybrid local - nonlocal model , first considered by svetlichny @xcite , where there is an arbitrary nonlocal correlation between two of the three particles but only local correlations between these two and the third particle . and",
    "the last situation is genuine tripartite nonlocality , where three particles are allowed to share arbitrary correlations . in the case of three qubits ,",
    "violation of mermin - ardehali - belinskii - klyshko ( mabk ) inequalities @xcite gives sufficient criteria to distinguish separable states from entangled ones .",
    "but it is not a necessary condition as there are states , which do no violate mabk inequalities but have genuine tripartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite it was shown that the @xmath0-qubit state , @xmath11 would not violate mabk inequalities for @xmath12 .",
    "in general , it is very difficult to discriminate between biseparable and genuinely entangled states .",
    "mabk inequalities give a sufficient condition to distinguish them @xcite .",
    "however as the condition is only sufficient but not a necessary one , biseparable and genuinely entangled states can not always be distinguished by means of these inequalities .",
    "furthermore , they can not be used to discriminate between the correlations due to tripartite genuine entanglement and local - nonlocal hybrid model @xcite .",
    "svetlichny constructed a stronger kind of inequality @xcite , which holds for three - particle local - nonlocal hybrid model and its violation guarantees the presence of tripartite genuine entanglement . according to svetlichny s definition , genuine tripartite entanglement and genuine tripartite nonlocality",
    "are not equivalent , as there are tripartite genuinely entangled states which do not violate svetlichny s inequality @xcite , i.e they are not genuinely tripartite nonlocal . whereas svetlichny s inequality allowed arbitrary nonlocal correlation between two parties , a more refined and strictly weaker definition of genuine tripartite nonlocality",
    "was introduced in @xcite . by analyzing the no - signalling polytope",
    ", they found a set of @xmath13 inequivalent facet inequalities and conjectured that every genuine tripartite entangled states show violations within this set and hence they are also genuinely tripartite nonlocal according to their definition .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that a class of states ( generalized ghz states within a specified parameter range for odd number of qubits ) do not violate any correlation bell inequalities , werner - wolf - ukowski - brukner ( wwb ) inequalities @xcite .",
    "so , the question naturally arises whether one can construct inequalities , which will be violated by any pure three - qubit entangled states .",
    "using hardy s nonlocality argument , it has been shown that all pure entangled states violate a single bell inequality @xcite .",
    "we will now present a new set of bell inequalities suitable for three - qubit pure states , without invoking hardy s nonlocality arguments .    in this work ,",
    "we have introduced a new set of bell inequalities , such that if one or more violations from the set is obtained for a three - qubit pure state , then the state is entangled .",
    "analytically we have shown that each inequality from the set is violated by all generalized ghz states , though they do nt always violate mabk or wwb inequalities .",
    "also it has been proved that each pure biseparable state violates exactly four inequalities from the set by the same maximal amount .",
    "we have provided numerical evidence that any pure genuinely entangled state will violate one or more inequalities from the set .",
    "taking all these into account , our set of inequalities can be used to certify three - qubit pure state entanglement .",
    "also , from the pattern of violation of inequalities , we can always distinguish between a pure biseparable and a pure genuine tripartite entangled three - qubit state .",
    "thus our criteria can detect and distinguish these two different types of entanglements present in three - qubit pure states .",
    "related to this work , in a recent study @xcite , some operators have been constructed which can distinguish between six slocc ( stochastic local operation and classical communication ) inequivalent classes for pure three - qubit states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a set of bell inequalities for three - qubit states . in section iii , we show that any pure three - qubit entangled state will violate at least one of these inequalities . in section iv , we generalize these inequalities to the case of @xmath0-qubits .",
    "the last section has conclusions .",
    "we consider a three - qubit system , with each qubit with alice , bob and charlie . in the bell",
    "inequalities that we introduce , two of the parties will make two measurements , while the third party will make only one measurement .",
    "this third party can be either alice , bob , or charlie .",
    "a general state need not have any symmetry , therefore we will be considering a set of bell inequalities , rather than one inequality .",
    "the one measurement by one of the parties is necessary .",
    "we note that in the original bell inequality @xcite , one of the two parties makes only one measurement .",
    "we will first list the set of 12 inequalities , and later explain the motivation . in this list ,",
    "the left - hand side should be thought of as the expectation value of the observables . in the first and second inequality ,",
    "alice makes one measurement given by observable @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , bob measures the observables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and charlie measures observables @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ". these are dichotomic observables , with values @xmath20 . in the inequalities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , bob measures only one observable and similarly for the others .",
    "@xmath23    to find the maximal violation of these inequalities for a state , one has to consider all possible measurements .",
    "therefore , inequalities obtained by interchange of @xmath15 and @xmath14 will give identical maximal violation .",
    "same will be true for other set of observables .",
    "therefore , we do not include such inequalities in our set . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the maximal value of these bell operators can be @xmath24 . to motivate these inequalities ,",
    "our starting point will be chsh inequality .",
    "this inequality reads as , @xmath25 , where @xmath15 , @xmath14 are the measurement choices for alice , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the measurement choices for bob and @xmath26 is the local - realistic value . again in left - hand side , expectation value is implicit . from tsirelson",
    "s bound @xcite , maximum value this operator can achieve for quantum states is @xmath24 .",
    "this value is achieved for the maximally entangled states - bell states .",
    "let us consider the state @xmath27 .",
    "this state is suitable for generalization to ghz state . for a suitable choice of measurements , for example , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we obtain the maximal violation of @xmath24 . for this choice of measurements ,",
    "the chsh operator takes the form @xmath32 .",
    "the state @xmath33 is its eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath24 @xcite . with local unitary transformations",
    ", we can find other forms of this operator , of which other bell states will be eigenstates with maximal eigenvalue .",
    "now , we want to construct an operator for three - qubit pure states such that , the ghz state of three qubits will be the eigenstate of this operator with highest eigenvalue .",
    "like the chsh operator , we can construct an operator such that its maximum eigenvalue will be @xmath24 .",
    "the ghz state , @xmath34 , is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath35 with eigenvalue @xmath24 .",
    "we can write other forms of this operator where identity operator acts on other qubits .",
    "we clearly see that we have even number of @xmath36 ; here it is one fewer than the number of qubits .",
    "this suggests that we need to make only one measurement on one of the qubits . with the help of this operator",
    ", we can construct a simplest set of bell inequalities .",
    "we need a set to take care of asymmetric situations .",
    "this set is given above .",
    "to look at it from a different point of view , identity in one place of the aforementioned operator gives us hint to construct non - correlation bell inequality .",
    "also from previous discussion , it is clear that to obtain violations for all pure entangled states , correlation bell inequalities are not enough .",
    "so , it seems that non - correlation bell inequalities may work .",
    "we show below by first considering generalized ghz states and then arbitrary three - qubit states that it is indeed true .",
    "in this section , we will consider three different classes of states ",
    "product states , pure biseparable states , and states with genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "we will see how our inequalities can distinguish these classes of states .",
    "in addition , we shall consider generalized ghz states .",
    "theses states are symmetric under the permutation of particles ; so we can pick any of the inequalities .",
    "all will be violated in the same manner .",
    "+ _ * proposition 1 : * _ _ all generalized ghz states violate all twelve inequalities of this set_. + * proof : * let s consider the three - qubit generalized ghz state , @xmath37    these states have been problematic for different inequalities",
    ". however , as our bell inequalities were designed for ghz states , all of these generalized ghz states violate all our inequalities . in the spirit of generalized schmidt decomposition",
    ", we can take @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be real and positive numbers .",
    "quantification of entanglement in multipartite scenario is a messy business . unlike pure bipartite system",
    ", there is no unique measure of entanglement for multipartite states @xcite .",
    "one uses different measures depending upon different purposes .",
    "von neumann entropy uniquely captures and quantify the entanglement for a pure bipartite system in the asymptotic limit . for a pure multipartite state",
    "one can use the average of von neumann entropy over each bipartition as a suitable measure of multipartite entanglement @xcite . for three qubit pure state",
    ", there are three bipartitions namely , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "average of von neumann entropy for generalized ghz state as defined in equation ( [ gghz ] ) over these bipartitions is @xmath43 .",
    "this is also the entropy for each bipartition for these states as the states are symmetric .",
    "we have plotted this average entropy with @xmath44 with @xmath45 , in figure ( [ en ] ) .",
    "plot.,width=309,height=200 ]    since the states are symmetric under the permutations of particles , we can choose any bell inequality from the set .",
    "we choose the inequality , @xmath46 let us recall that the expectation value for the left - hand side is implicit .",
    "we choose the following measurement settings , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . for these measurement settings ,",
    "the expectation value of the above bell operator for the generalized ghz state is @xmath52 its value is @xmath53=2[2\\alpha\\beta\\cos\\theta+\\sin\\theta]$ ] .",
    "now , @xmath54 . therefore @xmath55 is less or equal to @xmath56 , which is always greater than @xmath26 for nonzero @xmath38 , @xmath39 and gives maximum value @xmath24 for the conventional ghz state .",
    "the upper bound on the expectation value can be written as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "we have also plotted the optimized expectation value of the bell operator with @xmath44 in figure ( [ non ] ) .",
    "plot.,width=309,height=200 ]    from these two plots , it is clear that , the entanglement measure ( average von neumann entropy over the bipartitions ) , we introduced and the maximum amount of bell violation for generalized ghz states are monotonically related to each other . in a different way , we can say that for the generalized ghz state , the expectation value of the bell operator depends on the amount of entanglement .",
    "the more is the entanglement of a state the more bell nonlocal it is .",
    "the quantity @xmath59 is like concurrence for a two - qubit bipartite state .",
    "this concludes the proof .    as discussed earlier , this is the class of states which was creating problem for mabk , svetlichny and moreover for all correlation bell inequalities for a particular range of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , all states in this class violate all the inequalities in our set .",
    "+ _ * proposition 2 : * _ _ any separable pure three - qubit state obeys all the inequalities within the set . _ + * proof : * our inequalities are the hybrid version of the chsh inequality .",
    "all separable pure three - qubit states can be written , after applying some convenient local unitary transformation as as @xmath60 .",
    "we will use any one of the operators , say @xmath61 , as proof will be same for all the others .",
    "we take most general quantum measurements for the five observables , as @xmath62 and similarly for other observables @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , for which the parameters are @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; @xmath65 , @xmath66 ; @xmath67 , @xmath68 ; @xmath69 , @xmath70 ; @xmath71 , @xmath72 respectively .",
    "now , we will calculate the expectation value of the operator for the separable state .",
    "putting the form of the measurement for each operator , we get the expectation value to be @xmath73 .",
    "obviously we can write this expression as the conventional chsh operator like @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "so , clearly there will be some value of these operators such that the operator takes the maximum possible value , which is @xmath26 ( in analogy with the local - realistic value of chsh operator ) .",
    "similarly , for all other inequalities in the set , we will get the optimum violation of @xmath26 for all separable states .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "+ _ * proposition 3 : * _ _ all biseparable pure three - qubit states violate exactly four inequalities within the set and the amount of violations are same for all the four . _ + * proof : * this can be proved by observing the form of the inequalities .",
    "we can rewrite any biseparable state by local unitary transformations equivalent form of @xmath80 .",
    "( we can relabel qubits such that number ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' are entangled .",
    "this state is separable in @xmath40 bipartition .",
    "so , those inequalities , which can explore the entanglement between the second and the third qubit will be violated .",
    "for example , for the above mentioned state , @xmath81 will be violated , because a chsh type operator for second and third qubits is embedded in this operator .",

    "the last important fact is that , no other states ( except biseparable pure states ) will have same kind of violations , i.e exactly four violations of the same amount .    until now , we have considered special classes of three - qubit states .",
    "one would like to show that any genuinely entangled tripartite state will violate one of our inequalities . for this , we will be presenting numerical evidence , using a general parametrized form of a three - qubit state .",

    "results are displayed in figures ( [ first]-[seventh ] ) .",
    "+ at first , bell inequality @xmath90 was tested for these randomly generated states and out of 35,000 states , 2099 states do not violate this inequality , as shown in figure ( [ first ] ) . then using the inequality @xmath91 with these 2099 states , number of states which do not violate these first two inequalities",
    "was further reduced to 120 states , as shown in figure ( [ ineq2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , applying the other bell inequalities from the proposed set one by one the number of states showing no violation for those inequalities can be reduced to zero .",
