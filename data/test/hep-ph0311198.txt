    "the search for a plausible model of fermion masses is a continuing quest in particle physics . in particular",
    ", the quark sector is a fertile ground to test various models since it is there that one has the largest amount of information : quark masses , ckm angles , cp phase , and it is in this sector that most models turn their attention to .",
    "two of us have recently constructed a model of fermion masses @xcite in which the mass matrix is almost of the pure phase form and is constructed out of four plus two extra compact spatial dimensions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , one extra compact spatial dimension was needed to give a democratic mass matrix and another one was needed to make its matrix elements complex . in @xcite ,",
    "an almost pure phase mass matrix was found to take the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , although ref .",
    "@xcite contains a more general result .",
    "our motivation for that work was based on an attempt to give a theoretical basis for the so - called pure phase mass matrix ( ppmm ) ansatz ( similar to the previous form but with @xmath7 ) of ref.@xcite which , at the time of its construction , was quite successful in fitting the various angles and masses . in so doing",
    ", we arrived at a mass matrix which contains the pure phase form as a particular limit . as we shall see below , the general result of ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to be able to fit the latest determination of the ckm elements @xcite .",
    "along the way , as stipulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found a special region , in the allowed parameter space that fits the ckm matrix , where the parameter @xmath0 of the famous strong cp problem can be found to satisfy the experimental bound @xmath8 .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since it is not at all evident that solutions of our model that fit the mass spectrum and the ckm matrix could also give values of @xmath0 below the experimental bound .",
    "this connection between weak and strong cp is certainly very intriguing and will be the subject of our focus at the end of the paper",
    ".    the organization of the paper will be as follows .",
    "we first briefly review the construction of a democratic mass matrix ( dmm ) in five dimensions .",
    "we then summarize the salient points of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite : its construction in six dimensions and the resulting quark mass matrices .",
    "next we enumerate and describe the parameters used in the numerical analysis of the mass matrices which is carried out in the section that follows .",
    "there we will show the allowed region in our parameter space where solutions are found to fit both the mass spectrum and the ckm matrix .",
    "finally , we discuss a subspace in the allowed region where the bound @xmath8 is obeyed .",
    "in particular , we present some thoughts on the possible physics which might be responsible for this behaviour .",
    "before discussing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , let us first review how a democratic mass matrix ( dmm ) @xcite arises in the case with one extra compact dimension .",
    "a dmm is a special case of an almost ppmm with @xmath9 , namely one in which all matrix elements are unity , apart from a common factor , and hence the name `` democratic '' . as described in @xcite , in order to obtain a democratic mass matrix and to avoid unwanted flavour - changing neutral current processes ( fcnc ) , we imposed the following permutation symmetries on the action : @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . @xmath14 are the five - dimensional dirac fields whose left - handed zero modes are given respectively by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",

    "the extra dimension is compactified on an @xmath19 orbifold .",
    "the action which obeys this permutation symmetry is the sum of two terms , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where    @xmath22    @xmath23    in eq .",

    "( the gauge fields are supposed to be uniformly spread along the fifth dimension @xmath25 inside the thick brane . )",
    "@xmath26 is the vacuum expectation value vev for the background scalar field @xmath27",
    ". the attractive proposal of @xcite to localize chiral zero modes at different points along the extra dimension @xmath25 was adopted in @xcite . as a result , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the five dimensional `` masses '' which determine the locations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 along @xmath25 .",
    "( as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to have an invariant `` mass term '' under the @xmath30 symmetry , one has to require a `` mass reversal '' @xmath31 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath32 under @xmath30 could come for example in a model where the `` masses '' are generated by the radiative corrections to the vev @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 being independant of @xmath25 . because @xmath36 under @xmath30 symmetry , at the same time @xmath37 originating in this `` mass reversal '' . ) in eq .",
    "( [ syuk ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the yukawa couplings in five dimensions which have been chosen real and flavor independant and @xmath40 is the five dimensional sm doublet higgs field whose zero mode @xmath41 is assumed to be uniformly spread along @xmath25 inside the thick brane .",
    "here @xmath42 is the charge conjugation operator in five dimensions .    for the purpose of keeping track of the dimensionalities of various objects ,",

    "dimensionally reducing the above action to four dimensions , the following dimensionless combination appears in the yukawa term : @xmath49    the effective action for the yukawa term of the up sector in four dimensions can now be written as    @xmath50    where a similar expression holds for the down sector . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since all the @xmath51 s are located at the same place inside the brane , and similarly for all the @xmath52 s .",

    "while hermitian mass matrices do not give a realistic scenario , they have the important property of having a real determinant .",
    "this implies that the argument of their determinant is zero .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this fact could form the seed for a solution to the strong cp problem .",

    "however this symmetry has to be broken because , as we have already mentioned , the case in which the quark mass matrices are hermitian does not reproduce the right mass spectrum and the right ckm matrix .",
    "one could imagine a scenario where the `` left - right '' symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this will induce some loop corrections that will make the mass matrices deviate from hermiticity , reproducing the right mass spectrum and right ckm matrix . at the same time",
    "the breaking of this `` left - right '' symmetry could induce at loop levels a nonvanishing @xmath0 .",
    "but one can envision a scenario were the deviation from hermiticity happens in such a way that @xmath286 and @xmath287 , each being now of @xmath172 , can cancel each other so as to keep @xmath284 .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , the solutions presented in this paper correspond to very small windows for the domain wall parameters @xmath289 s , because we wanted to put in evidence the effect of the `` left - right '' symmetry breaking , especially in the @xmath0 parameter . in searching for a quantity which could `` retain the memory '' of this `` left - right '' symmetry",
    ", we decided to plot , see fig .",
    "13 , the sum of the arguments @xmath290 versus the `` com '' , the weighted average of the `` mass '' terms along the sixth dimension , which is defined as    @xmath291    as one can notice from fig .",
    "13 , the sum of the arguments tends to go to zero for a particular @xmath292 , and this behavior is confirmed in fig . 14 .",
    "notice that , for practical reasons , we have reduced the number of points ( i.e. the number of solutions ) in figs . 13 and 14 in order to reduce the sizes of the files containing these two figures .",
    "the actual number of solutions is much larger than what is shown in these figures .",
    "now one can think that the value of @xmath293 for the `` com '' when the `` left - right '' symmetry is broken , and which corresponds to @xmath284 , was also the value for the `` com '' before the breaking , when @xmath0 was equal to zero .",
    "in other words one can imagine a scenario where the `` mass '' terms of left and right components are split such a way as to retain the same value of the `` com '' .",
    "to invent a mechanism which could break the `` left - right '' symmetry and which could reproduce the scenario mentioned above is beyond the scope of this paper , but it is one of the main topics we would like to investigate in the future .    if one now looks at fig .",
    "8 which show the solutions in the @xmath294 plane for @xmath295 in the three different ranges , one can see that the solutions corresponding to @xmath296 tend to favor a particular region of the @xmath294 plane .",
    "in particular , the region of allowed solutions shrinks down in the @xmath1 direction constraining the parameter @xmath1 in the small window @xmath297 $ ] .",
    "these solutions are within @xmath279 and @xmath280 of the so - called r - fit and bayesian fit respectively as can be seen from fig .",
    "8 . this could be an artifact of the way the minimization process works , but it could also be an indication that there is a deep connection between weak cp violation and strong cp violation in our model .    as we have already mentioned earlier , one can not exclude completely the existence of other solutions , because of the way the minimization process works , but we believe that the results obtained here can give some very good indications of how the allowed parameter space might look like .",
    "we have presented in this paper a complete phenomenological analysis of the model of quark mass matrices as derived from six dimensions by @xcite . with just 10 parameters , we have found a large number of solutions which can fit the 6 quark masses as well as the ckm matrix as can be seen in figs .",
    "( 1 - 9 ) .",
    "furthermore , we subdivide these solutions into three sets : 1 ) those that have @xmath298 , 2 ) those that have @xmath299 , and finally 3 ) those that have @xmath300 .",
    "the first two sets are given for the sole purpose of comparison with the last set which is most relevant to the strong cp problem as discussed in the last section .",
    "as one can observe from figs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , there is a deep connection between the weak cp parameters and the strong cp phase . in order to satisfy the constraint on the @xmath0 parameter , i.e. @xmath301 in our framework ,",
    "the solutions obtained for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are found to be within @xmath279 and @xmath280 of the so - called r - fit and bayesian fit respectively . as measurements of weak cp parameters",
    "become more accurate in the future , they will either rule out or confirm our predictions .",
    "we would like to thank andrzej buras and gino isidori for valuable comments .",
    "one of us ( pqh ) would like to thank the theory group of laboratorio nazionale di frascati for hospitality during the course of this work .",
    "( as ) would like to thank mike timmins for introducing the simulated annealing method and ngoc - khanh tran for usefull discussions .",
    "our work is supported in parts by the us department of energy under grant no .",
    "de - a505 - 89er40518 .",
    "as mentioned above the model we considered has @xmath302 free parameters .",
    "relying on this freedom we were able to fit the 6 quark masses evaluated at an energy scale equal to the mass of z gauge boson @xmath143 , with constraints for the two ratios @xmath228 and @xmath231 , the absolute values of the ckm matrix elements and the cp parameters @xmath294 , or equivalently the three angles and one phase of the ckm matrix standard parametrization , for a total number of 10 quantities .",
    "the approach we used to derive the parameter space consists in minimizing a particular function , built in such a way that its global minima correspond to the region defined by the experimental constraints .",
    "this function is defined in the following way :      where @xmath304 is the step function , n is the number of quantities that we want to fit , @xmath305 is the predicted value for the @xmath306 quantity , @xmath307 and @xmath308 fix the range for the @xmath306 quantity , and @xmath208 is its average value .",
    "it is immediate to verify from eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) that when all the predicted quantities @xmath305 s are contained in the proper ranges , the function @xmath275 takes its minimum value equal to zero .",
    "the set of parameters which correspond to a zero value for the function @xmath275 is called a solution . in our particular case",
    "the function we are considering is a mapping from @xmath309 to @xmath310 .",
    "the parameter space is really big and to find the solutions , which correspond to the global minima of @xmath275 , can be very challenging .",
    "the global minima of @xmath275 can be infact surrounded by a lot of local minima which most of the time can make the minimization process fail .",
    "therefore , just trying different initial conditions with the hope to find the good one that will allow the minimization process to follow the right path towards a global minimum can result quite inefficient .    it is a common belief that there does not exist a general recipe to follow for minimization problems .",
    "a minimization procedure that can be very efficient for a particular problem , can be very inefficient in an another case or even fails . in the particular case where the function that we want to minimize depends on many parameters , there is a minimization procedure , called simulated annealing @xcite@xcite , which seems to work more efficiently than others .",
    "this procedure is mostly used when the global minima are surrounded by a lot of local minima .",
    "infact this minimization process can find a global minimum also after being trapped in a local minimum .",
    "the way instead most of the minimization processes work is to go , from the starting point , immediately downhill as far as they can go , but this often leads to a local minimum .    at the heart of the method of simulated annealing",
    "is an analogy with thermodynamics , specifically with the way liquids crystallize , or metal cool and anneal .",
    "when a liquid is cooled down sufficiently slowly , the atoms are often able to line themeselves up and form a pure crystal , which corresponds to the state of minimum energy for the system .",
    "but if the liquid is cooled quickly , it does not reach this state but rather ends up in an amorphous state of higher energy .",
    "so nature , as long as the process of cooling is sufficiently slow , is able to find the minimum energy state .",
    "the way nature works is based on the fact that for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature t , the probability for the system to be in a state of energy @xmath311 is given by the boltzmann probability distribution :      this implies that even at low temperature there is a chance , albeit a tiny one , for the system to be in a high energy state",
    ". therefore , there exists the possibility for the system to get out of a local energy minimum and move towards the global one .",
    "this principle has been incorporated in what is called a metropolis algorithm @xcite . given a simulated thermodynamic system , it is assigned a probability @xmath313 to the change from a configuration with energy @xmath314 to one with energy @xmath315 .",
    "if @xmath316 , @xmath317 is greater than unity and in this case to the change is assigned a probability @xmath318 , which is equivalent to say that the system always makes such a change . in the case @xmath319",
    ", one can compare the probability @xmath313 with a @xmath320 and make the change to the new configuration only if @xmath321 .",
    "the system always takes a downhill step while sometimes takes an uphill step .",
    "the metropolis algorithm can be used for systems other than the thermodynamic ones if we give :    * a description of possible system configurations . * a generator of random changes in the configuration . * a function @xmath311 ( analog of energy ) whose minimization is the goal of the procedure . * a control parameter @xmath322 ( analog of temperature ) and an annealing schedule which tells how it is lowered , e.g. after how many random changes in configuration and with which step .",
    "going back to our particular case , the function @xmath275 we want to minimize is the analog of the energy , and each possible set of parameters correspond to a particular configuration of the system . for the algorithm to work a control parameter @xmath322 , with an annealing schedule by which it is gradually reduced ,",
    "has to be introduced , as well as a generator of random changes in the configuration , that is in the parameter space .",
    "the way these random changes are taken is the following : a positive quantity , given by @xmath323 , is added to the stored function value .",
    "the same quantity is subtracted from the function value corresponding to every new set parameters that are tried as a replacement point in the parameter space .",
    "( the new points are obtained using the downhill simplex method .",
    "the simplex is a set of @xmath324 points with n the number of parameters , and the changes happen through reflections , expansions and contractions of the simplex ) . as mentioned before , this method allowed the system to jump from a local minimum and to look for a global one .",
    "the algorithm that we have used has been taken from numerical recipes @xcite .",
    "other than the initial set of values for the parameters , also the value for the temperature and the number of iterations which determine the annealing schedule to reduce the temperature , has to be given as input .",
    "the way these last two values were chosen , as well as the initials conditions is mostly the result of different attempts .",
    "the output of our code is a patch of solutions , which have been subsequently tested using an independent code written in mathematica .",
