    "we want to understand what is the trade - off between the losses and useful properties inherited by the composite from its components .",
    "our motivation comes from a major problem in the design of such structures where a component which carries a useful property , e.g. , magnetism , has prohibitively strong losses in the frequency range of interest .",
    "often this precludes the use of such a lossy component with otherwise excellent physically desirable properties .",
    "then the question stands : is it possible to design a composite system having a useful property at a level comparable to that of its lossy component but with significantly reduced losses over a broad frequency range ?",
    "an important and guiding example of a two - component dielectric medium composed of a high - loss and lossless components was constructed in @xcite .",
    "the example was a simple layered structure which had magnetic properties comparable with a natural bulk material but with 100 times lesser losses in a wide frequency range .",
    "this example demonstrated that it is possible to design a composite material / system which can have a desired property comparable with a naturally occurring bulk substance but with significantly reduced losses .    in order to understand the general mechanism for this phenomenon ,",
    "the authors in @xcite considered a general dynamical system as the model for such a medium where the high - loss component of the medium was represented as a significant fraction of the entire system .",
    "we have found that for such a system the losses of the entire structure become small provided that the lossy component is sufficiently lossy .",
    "the general mechanism of this phenomenon , which we proved in @xcite , is the _ modal dichotomy _ when the entire set of modes of the system splits into two distinct classes , _ high - loss _ and _ low - loss modes _ , based on their dissipative properties .",
    "the higher loss modes for a wide range of frequencies contribute very little to losses and this is how the entire structure can be low loss , whereas the useful property is still present . in that work the way we accounted for the presence of a useful property was by simply demanding that the lossy component was a significant fraction of the entire composite structure without explicitly correlating the useful property and the losses .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our studies on the modal dichotomy and overdamping , which began in @xcite , but now we focus are attention on gyroscopic - dissipative systems .",
    "although our results on modal dichotomy apply to the full generality of the dynamical systems considered here , our results on overdamping in this paper will be restricted to systems without gyroscopy .",

    "we now give a concise qualitative description of the main results of this paper which are discussed next and organized under the following three topics : overdamping and selective overdamping in section [ sodan ] ; virial theorem for dissipative systems and equipartition of energy in section [ svir ] ; standard spectral theory vs. krein theory in sections [ smodel ] and [ sspan ] .",
    "* overdamping and selective overdamping*. overdamping is a regime in dissipative lagrangian systems in which some of the systems eigenmodes are overdamped , i.e. , have exactly zero frequency or , in other words , are non - oscillatory when losses are sufficiently large .",
    "the phenomenon of overdamping has been studied thoroughly but only in the case when the entire system is overdamped @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 ) , @xcite meaning all its modes are non - oscillatory . the lagrangian framework and the methods we develop in this paper are applicable to the more general case allowing for only a fraction of the modes to be susceptible to overdamping , a phenomenon we call _ selective overdamping_. our analysis of overdamping and this selective overdamping phenomenon is carried out in section [ sodan ] .",
    "our main results are theorems [ tcovd ] , [ tpovd ] , [ cpodr ] , [ thmod ] , and [ tseod ] .",
    "our interest in selective overdamping is threefold .",
    "first , as we prove in this paper the selective overdamping of the system is a rather _ universal phenomenon _ that can occur for a two - component system when the losses of the lossy component are sufficiently large .",
    "moreover , we show that _ the large losses in the lossy component _ cause not only the modal dichotomy , but also _ results in overdamping of all of the high - loss modes while a positive fraction of the low - loss modes remain oscillatory_. second , since mode excitation is efficient only when its frequency matches the frequency of the excitation force , if these high - loss modes go into the overdamping regime having exactly zero frequency these modes can not be excited efficiently and therefore their associated losses are essentially eliminated .",
    "this explains the absorption suppression for systems composed of lossy and lossless components .",
    "third , as we will show , as the losses in the lossy component increase the overdamped high - loss modes are more suppressed while all the low - loss oscillatory modes are more enhanced with increasingly high quality factor .",
    "_ this provides a mechanism for selective enhancement of these high quality factor , low - loss oscillatory modes and selective suppression of the high - loss non - oscillatory modes_.    in fact , we show that _ the fraction of all overdamped modes is exactly the loss fraction _ @xmath1 _ _  which satisfies _ _ @xmath0 , and half of these overdamped modes are the high - loss modes .",
    "thus it is _ exactly the positive fraction _ @xmath2 _ _  of modes which are low - loss oscillatory modes__. in addition , _ these latter modes have extremely high quality factor which increases as the losses in the lossy component increase_. an example of this behavior using the electric circuit in section [ scircuits ] was shown numerically in @xcite .    * virial theorem for dissipative systems and equipartition of energy*. recall that the virial theorem from classical mechanics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;  3.4 ) ( which we review in appendix [ apdxvirthm ] ) is about the oscillatory transfer of energy from one form to another and its equipartition . for conservative linear systems",
    "whose lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic and potential energy , e.g. , a spring - mass system or a parallel lc circuit , the virial theorem says that for any time - periodic state of the system , the time - averaged kinetic energy equals the time - averaged potential energy .",
    "this result is known as the equipartition of energy because of the fact that the total energy of the system , i.e. , the hamiltonian , is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energy .",
    "it is this result that we generalize in this paper for dissipative lagrangian systems and their damped oscillatory modes .",
    "in particular , we show that _ for any damped oscillatory mode of the system the kinetic energy equals the potential energy _ and so _",
    "there is an equipartition of the system energy for these damped oscillatory modes into kinetic and potential energy_. our precise statements of these results can be found in section [ svir ] in theorem [ tvir ] and corollary [ tvir_eqp ] .",
    "we have also found that the transition to overdamping is characterized by a breakdown of the virial theorem .",
    "more specifically , as the losses of the lossy component increase some of the modes become overdamped with complete ceasing of any oscillations and with breaking of the equality between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "such a _ breaking of the equipartition of the energy can viewed as a dynamical characterization of the overdamped modes ! _",
    "so we now have two different characterizations of overdamping : spectral and dynamical .",
    "the effectiveness of this dynamical characterization is demonstrated in our study of the selective overdamping phenomenon and in proving that a positive fraction of modes always remain oscillatory no matter how large the losses become in the lossy component of the composite system .    * standard spectral theory vs. krein spectral theory*. the study of the eigenmodes of a lagrangian system often relies on the fact the system evolution can be transformed into the hamiltonian form as the first - order linear differential equations .",
    "however , it is not emphasized enough that the hamiltonian setting does not lead directly to the standard spectral theory of self - adjoint or dissipative operators but that only it might be reduced to one in some important and well known cases by a proper transformation as , for instance , in the case of a simple oscillator .",
    "the general spectral theory of hamiltonian systems is known as the _ krein spectral theory _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this theory is far more complex than the standard spectral theory and it is much harder to apply .",
    "we have found , as discussed in section [ smodel ] , a general transformation that reduces the evolution equation to the standard spectral theory under the condition of positivity of the hamiltonian .",
    "the standard spectral theory is complete , well understood , and allows for an elaborate and effective perturbation theory .",
    "we used that all in our analysis of the modal dichotomy and symmetries of the spectrum in section [ sspan ] as well as the selective overdamping phenomenon in section [ sodan ] .",
    "our main results on spectral symmetries are proposition [ pssym ] and corollary [ cssym ] .",
    "our principal results on the modal dichotomy can be found in theorems [ tmdic ] , [ cpodr ] and corollaries [ cpfsp ] , [ cmdic ] .",
    "in fact , it is important to point out that the key result of this paper that leads to the modal dichotomy which is essential in the analysis of overdamping is proposition [ pevbd ] which relates to certain eigenvalue bounds .",
    "moreover , these bounds and the dichotomy come from some general results that we derive in appendix [ apxebd ] on the perturbation theory for matrices with a large imaginary part .    [ [ organization - of - the - paper . ] ] organization of the paper .",

    "sections [ svir][sodan ] are devoted to a precise formulation of all significant results in the form of theorems , propositions , and so on ( with section [ sproofs ] providing the proofs of these results ) .",
    "more specifically , section [ svir ] discusses our extension of the virial theorem and equipartition of energy from classical mechanics for conservative lagrangian systems to dissipative systems .",
    "section [ sspan ] is on the spectral analysis of the system eigenmodes including spectral symmetries , modal dichotomy , and perturbation theory in the high - loss regime .",
    "section [ sodan ] contains our analysis of the overdamping phenomena including selective overdamping .",
    "appendices [ apxsc ] and [ apxebd ] contain results we need that we believe will be of use more generally in studying dissipative dynamical systems , but especially for composite systems with high - loss and lossless components .",
    "in particular , appendix [ apxebd ] is on the perturbation theory for matrices with a large imaginary part .",
    "finally , appendices [ apenerg ] and [ apdxvirthm ] review the virial theorem from classical mechanics from the energetic point of view .",
    "the lagrangian and hamiltonian frameworks have numerous well known advantages in describing the evolution of physical systems .",
    "these advantages include , in particular , the universality of the mathematical structure , the flexibility in the choice of variables and the incorporation of the symmetries with the corresponding conservations laws .",
    "consequently , it seems quite natural and attractive to integrate dissipation into the lagrangian and hamiltonian frameworks .",
    "we are particular interested in integrating dissipation into systems with gyroscopic features such as dielectric media with magnetic components and electrical networks .",
