    "the so - called berry phase or geometric phase was first pointed out by berry@xcite when he studied a pure quantum system that undergoes an adiabatic cyclic evolution .",
    "simon gave an interpretation of this phase in the language of differential geometry and fibre bundles@xcite .",
    "since then , large numbers of work have been done to generalize the conception of berry phase .",
    "for example , aharonov and anandan extended the berry phase to the case of non - adiabatic evolution@xcite , samuel and bhandari @xcite generalized the berry phase in cyclic evolution to the case of non - cyclic evolution .",
    "another direction of the generalization is to study the geometric phase for mixed states and nonunitary evolution .",
    "this work was first done by uhlmann@xcite via the mathematical context of purification .",
    "_ gave an alternate definition of geometric phase for nondegenerate density operators undergoing unitary evolution based on quantum interferometry@xcite .",
    "this study has been extended to the case of degenerate density operators by singh _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "geometric phase in nonunitary evolution have been addressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently a kinematic approach to the geometric phase for mixed quantal states in nonunitary evolution is proposed by tong _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the conception of off - diagonal geometric phase for pure states was proposed in ref.@xcite and has been extended to mixed states in ref.@xcite .",
    "the relation of geometric phase between entangled system and its subsystem has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the intrinsic nature of geometric phase provides us an impelling tool for fault tolerance quantum computation@xcite .",
    "however , the unavoided interaction between system and environment would destroy the coherence of the quantum system and hence to limit the implementation of quantum computation .",
    "so the study of environment effects on geometric phase is highly required .",
    "geometric phases in dephasing system and spin environment were studied in ref.@xcite , which used the exact solution of the system dynamics and then it is fully non - markovian .",
    "however the exactly solvable models for open system are only few , most problems are treated with certain approximations .",
    "for instance , the finite temperature effect of environment on the mixed state geometric phases@xcite and the effects of a squeezed vacuum reservoir on geometric phases@xcite were studied within the markovian approximation .",
    "it is well known that when the dissipation is large or reservoir is finite and the initial state of the composite system(system and environment ) is entangled , the process exhibits strong non - markovian effects . in this paper",
    "we shall study the non - markovian effects on the geometric phase of a two - level atom interacting with a non - markovian environment .",
    "three kinds of methods which describe the non - markovian process , projection superoperator technique , memory kernel master equation and post - markovian master equation , are considered .",
    "we calculate the geometric phase for the system governed by these equations and discuss the results obtained with different dissipation rates and different memory effects .    throughout this paper , the geometric phases",
    "are calculated according to the formula of tong@xcite ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 are instantaneous eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath2 and @xmath3 are corresponding eigenstates .",
    "the dot on @xmath4 denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath5 , @xmath6 expresses the argument of a complex number .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss a two - level atom interacting with a two - band environment .",
    "the evolution equation is obtained via the projection superoperator methods . in sec.iii",
    ", we calculate the geometric phase in an open system governed by the memory kernel master equation and in sec.iv governed by the post - markovian master equation .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in sec.v",
    "in this section , we will calculate the geometric phase of a two - level atom(system ) coupled to a two - band environment in both markovian and non - markovian cases .",
    "the evolutions of the reduced density matrix for the atom in both cases are obtained through correlated projection superoperators method@xcite , different chosen projection operators would differentiate the markovian and non - mardovian cases . to calculate the geometric phase we solve the time evolution of the system in the interaction picture then back to the schrdinger picture according to the free hamiltonian of the system @xmath7 . in the following discussion ,",
    "the initial state is chosen as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the excited state and ground state of the atom respectively .",
    "this state corresponds to a state vector in bloch sphere with polar angle @xmath11 and azimuthal angle @xmath12 .",
    "consider a two - level atom coupled to a two - band environment @xmath13 .",
    "the environment consists of a large number of energy levels which are arranged in two energy bands with the same width(see fig.[setup ] ) .",
    "the levels of each band are equidistant .",
    "the lower energy band contains @xmath14 levels while the upper band @xmath15 levels .",
    "the transition of the atom is in resonance with distance @xmath16 between the bands ( we set @xmath17 ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian for such a system is @xcite @xmath18 , with @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where the index @xmath22 denotes the levels of lower energy band and @xmath23 the levels of upper band , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are pauli operators , @xmath26 is the overall strength of the interaction , @xmath27 are coupling constants which are independent to each other and satisfying , @xmath28    setting @xmath29 , we transform our discussion to the interaction picture that , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32      when the standard projection is used , the evolution of the reduce system must be markovian@xcite . if we project the composite system s state into the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the projection superoperator and @xmath35 , the second - order markovian master equation in the interaction picture is obtained@xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37    this equation is the same as that describes a two - level atom spontaneously decay in vacuum under the markovian approximation .",
    "the time dependent of the reduce system in the schrdinger picture may be obtained easily by a simple calculation . with the initial state eq.([initialstate ] ) , the final state follows ,    @xmath38    the two eigenvalues of @xmath2 are @xmath39 where @xmath40 it is obviously that the eigenvalue @xmath41 at @xmath42 . from the formation of eq.([tonggp ] ) , we can see that the eigenvalue @xmath43 and its corresponding eigenstate @xmath44 contribute zero to the geometric phase .",
    "this simplifies the calculation .",
    "the eigenstate correspond to @xmath45 can be written as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 obviously , for @xmath42 , @xmath48 , as expected .",
    "now we substitute eqs.([eigenvaluemarkovianp ] ) and ( [ eigenstatemarkovianp ] ) into eq.([tonggp ] ) to obtain the geometric phase at time @xmath5 ,    @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we consider the geometric phase acquired after a quasi - periods @xmath50 . in this case , we can rewrite the geometric phase as @xmath51 where @xmath52 can be obtained according to eq.([tanmarkovianp ] ) @xmath53      if we choose a correlated projection on the total system @xmath54 where @xmath55 , the evolution of the reduced system is said to be non - markovian@xcite . at this stage",
    "the master equation in the interaction picture is@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 has the similar definition to @xmath58 and the state of atom is given by @xmath59 .",
    "this equation is of a generalized lindblad form@xcite and gives an excellent approximation of the reduced system s dynamics@xcite .",
    "we assume that initially only the lower band is populated .",
    "this means @xmath60 .",
    "we also set @xmath61 .",
    "the evolution of the atom with the initial condition ( [ initialstate ] ) in the schrdinger picture is @xmath62    following the same procedure mentioned in markovian process , the geometric phase acquired after a quasi - periods @xmath50 takes the same form as eq.([gp ] ) , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined by @xmath65 @xmath66    the geometric phases as a function of initial polar angle @xmath11 in both markovian and non - markovian cases are shown in fig.[geophglindblad ] . in this figure , we have set transition frequency @xmath67 and @xmath61 .",
    "the geometric phase @xmath68 and the polar angle @xmath11 are plotted in units of @xmath69 .",
    "we see from this figure that when the dissipation is weak(@xmath70 ) , the geometric phase for both processes are similar especially when @xmath71 , whereas when the dissipation is large(@xmath72 ) , the non - markovian effect changes the geometric phase drastically , especially when @xmath73 . because the time dependent for the off - diagonal elements @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the same , we shall study the difference of diagonal elements @xmath76 in both cases .",
    "the decay functions are @xmath77 and @xmath78 for markovian and non - markovian equation respectively .",
    "when @xmath79 is small enough , we can make a taylor expansion and ignore all items higher than the second - order .",
    "then @xmath80 , i.e. the dynamics are the same for weak dissipation and short time , so it can be easily understood that the geometric phases are nearly the same .",
    "when the dissipation is large , the items higher than the second - order can not be ignored for a quasi - periods . in this case , we set @xmath73 , i.e. , the initial state vector in bloch sphere is near the @xmath81 axis . after a quasi - periods",
    ", the vector turns to the hemisphere containing the @xmath82 axis in markovian case while it remains in the initial hemisphere in the non - markovian one .",
    "this is the reason why the difference is so large between both processes with large dissipation rate at @xmath73 , with which the geometric phase is usually interpreted as the solid angle of the evolution track in bloch sphere .",
    "we also note that in the figures here and below in this paper , the left boundaries of @xmath11 are all set @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath83 , the geometric phase in all these processes are zero .",
    "the qualitative analysis ( see the solid line in the bottom figure ) is following.in the markovian case , because of the semi - positivity of @xmath64 , the two branches of the eigenvalues @xmath84 maintain the relation @xmath85 all the time for @xmath86 .",
    "the calculation of the geometric phase given above is available .",
    "when @xmath73 and @xmath87 the two eigenvalues tend to be equal , i.e. the eigenstates of the density matrix are approximately degenerate .",
    "after this critical point , the relation @xmath85 holds again in the above calculation .",
    "however , as a matter of fact , in the case of @xmath83 , the two branches should be crossing , and the relation @xmath85 should be changed after the critical point .",
    "moreover , when the degeneration occurs , the geometric phase should be calculated as discussed at the end of ref.@xcite , which in our model shows that when @xmath83 , the matrix elements of @xmath2 and the eigenvalues and as well as the coefficients of the eigenstates are all real .",
    "those facts make the geometric phase zero all the time .",
    "this results in the difference in the two cases @xmath83 and @xmath73 .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the geometric phase of a two - level atom by using a memory kernel master equation with exponential memory phenomenologically .",
    "this equation may lead to a non - positive reduced density matrix@xcite and the positivity for a qubit has been discussed in ref.@xcite . in this paper , we focus on the geometric phase only and do not take the positivity into account .",
    "we consider a two - level atom interacting with a vacuum .",
    "an integrodifferential master equation containing the memory kernel in the interaction picture is@xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the liouvillian superoperator that may take the form @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the memory kernel and here we choose an exponential memory phenomenologically @xmath92 we call @xmath93 the memory time .",
    "@xmath94 is the dissipation constant .",
    "one can solve this integrodifferential equation by taking its laplace transform , determining the poles and inverting the solution in the standard way .",
    "the analytic solution of this equation@xcite with initial condition eq.([initialstate ] ) in schrdinger representation is @xmath95 where @xmath96 is given by eq.([memeoryxi ] ) ,    @xmath97+\\cosh[\\frac{\\tau}2\\sqrt{|1 - 4r|}]\\right\\}\\label{memeoryxi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "this coefficients are valid for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the form of these coefficients",
    "are acquired by substituting @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] with @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "after the same procedure given above , we obtain the geometric phase acquired at time @xmath50 as eq.([gp ] ) with @xmath108 and @xmath109    the geometric phases of the system governed by the generalized lindblad master equation as a function of @xmath11 are shown in fig.([geophexpmemory ] ) , we plot this figure with exponential memory for different dissipation rate @xmath94 and different memory time @xmath110 .",
    "the geometric phase @xmath68 and the polar angle @xmath11 are plotted in units of @xmath69 .",
    "we see from the figure that for weak dissipation(small dissipation constant,@xmath111 ) , the three curves stand much close , even when the memory time is long(@xmath70 ) . for large dissipation rate ,",
    "long time memory lead to a large departure from the markovian process .",
    "when the memory time is shortened(@xmath112 ) , the result tends to the markovian .",
    "in ref.@xcite , a post - markovian master equation including bath memory effects via a phenomenological introduced memory kernel @xmath91 is derived .",
    "compared with the memory kernel master equation , the advantage of post - markovian master equation is that for a qubit it keeps the positivity of the density matrix for an exponential memory@xcite .",
    "the general form of post - markovian master equation for a two - level atom in zero - temperature reservoir is @xmath113 where @xmath89 is the liouvillian superoperator and @xmath91 is the exponential memory kernel .",
    "it has been proved that the memory kernel master equation is a special case of post - markovian master equation and one may derive the memory kernel master equation from the post - markovian equation in the limit @xmath114@xcite .",
    "the time dependent of the state for atom and the geometric phase after a quasi - periods have the same form as that from the memory kernel master equation , the only difference is that the quantity @xmath96 is replaced by@xcite @xmath115    the geometric phase for the post - markovian master equation is shown in fig.([geophpost ] ) .",
    "a similar feature as that from the memory kernel master equation can be seen in the figure .",
    "furthermore when the dissipation rate is small , the figure is nearly the same as that obtained from the memory kernel master equation .",
    "the difference between the two cases can be found in the large dissipation case , e.g. , the geometric phase departure from the markovian process more largely with @xmath70 than that in memory kernel master equation .",
    "in summary , we have studied the geometric phases of a two - level system coupled to a non - markovian environment .",
    "the non - markovian effects on the geometric phase are presented and discussed .",
    "we have chosen three different methods to describe the non - markovian process .",
    "the common feature is that the geometric phase tends to zero with @xmath11 approaches @xmath69 .",
    "as the memory kernel master equation can be reproduced from the post - markovian master equation in the limit of @xmath114 , the geometric phase calculated confirmed this point in this limit .",
    "our results also show that for all the methods the non - markovian effects change the geometric phase more strikingly when the dissipation rate and population of excited state in the initial state is large .",
    "this can be understood as the competition between the decoherence and the non - markovian effects in the open system .",
