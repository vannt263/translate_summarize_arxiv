    "packing problems are among the most ancient . for instance , about 2200 years ago archimedes faced the problem of counting the number of grains of the beaches of its home town , syracuse , and succeeded in demonstrating that this number is finite ( archimedes , _ the sand rockener _ ) . another eminent greek scientists , apollonious of perga , is also renowned for his works on disk and sphere packings .",
    "modern works on disordered packing of grains dates back to the experiments conducted by bernal@xcite and scott@xcite , who prepared packings of monodisperse spheres using different protocols , and were able to measure their volume fraction @xmath4 , defined as the fraction of the total volume occupied by the spheres .",
    "their results indicated the existence of an upper and of a lower bound for the volume fraction of stable disordered arrangements of spheres , named ` random close packing ' , @xmath3 , and ` loose random packing ' , @xmath2 .",
    "bernal estimated @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in the infinite system size limit . regarding the existence of any first principle definition of these two bounds , bernal@xcite speculated that ` the figure for the occupied volume of random close packing must be mathematically determinable , although so far we known undetermined ' .",
    "conversely , he questioned the existence of a first principle definition of the lower bound @xmath2 : ` the mathematical status of physical random loose packing is not so evident ' .",
    "subsequent works clarified that @xmath2 depends on the coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "onoda and liniger@xcite operatively defined @xmath2 as the smallest volume fraction attainable letting the particle sediment under gravity .",
    "this lower bound is obtained in the limit of zero sedimentation velocity , when particles fall in a very high viscous fluid .",
    "onoda and liniger@xcite estimated @xmath7 , while a more recent work@xcite suggests @xmath8 .    since @xmath2 depends on the friction coefficient",
    ", it is of interest to consider its value in the frictionless case .",
    "published results seem to indicate that , in absence of friction , @xmath9 .",
    "consider , for instance , the ` jamming phase diagram ' introduced by liu and nagel@xcite , illustrating the region of the temperature , volume fraction and stress space where jammed ( mechanically stable ) systems are found . along the volume fraction axis ,",
    "i.e. at zero temperature and zero applied stress , the transition between the unjammed and the jammed phase is marked to occur at a single value of the volume fraction , known as the j  point and later identified with the random close packing volume fraction @xmath3 .",
    "since for @xmath10 there are not jammed states , the diagram suggests that at zero friction @xmath2 coincides with @xmath3 .",
    "the same conclusion could be drawn from the results of ohern and coworkers@xcite , who numerically generated jammed packings of soft frictionless spheres using the conjugate  gradient protocol . in the hard sphere limit , they found jammed packings only at the volume fraction @xmath11 , identified with @xmath3",
    ". being the only volume fraction at which jammed packings are found , it seems obvious to also identify @xmath12 with @xmath2 , concluding that at zero friction @xmath13 .    in this manuscript",
    "we give evidence that , at zero friction , @xmath14 .",
    "an indication suggesting this possibility comes from the comparison of numerical results found by different research groups , which have used slightly different algorithms to prepare jammed packings of frictionless particles .",
    "for instance , using the conjugate gradient method@xcite , ohern et al .",
    "suggested @xmath15 , while using a packing inflation algorithm zhang and makse@xcite obtained @xmath16 ( with an error of the order of @xmath17 ) .",
    "a very close value , @xmath18 , was also reported in previous works@xcite .",
    "these estimates are close , but not consistent within the reported errors",
    ". the discrepancies could be in principle attributed to one of the following causes :    1 .",
    "finite  size effects .",
    "one or both estimates are wrong as affected by finite  size effects . 2 .   ordering .",
    "the upper bound for the volume fraction of grain packings is that of the fcc crystal , @xmath19 .",
    "one could therefore speculate that jammed packings with volume fraction above @xmath20 contains some crystalline patches .",
    "disordered jammed packings occur in a whole volume fraction range , at least varying from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the possibility a ) must be excluded , as finite  size are known to influence the jamming volume fraction leading to a smaller estimate of the critical packing fraction@xcite .",
    "however , the smaller of the above estimates , @xmath20 , has been obtained via a careful study of the infinite system size limit@xcite .",
    "here we introduce an algorithm able to generate jammed packings in a large volume fraction range ( enclosing the range @xmath21@xmath18 ) , and show that point b must also be excluded .",
    "in fact , altough the concept of random close packing of spheres is ill ",
    "defined@xcite due to the absence of precise definition of ` randomness ' , nevertheless our results indicate that it is possible to generate jammed disordered state with no cristalline patches up to the volume fraction @xmath23 , which is our estimation of the random close packing volume fraction .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that point c above is correct , i.e. that the jamming transition of frictionless spheres occurs along a whole volume fraction range . the manuscript is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] we describe our numerical model and the protocol used to generated jammed packings of frictionless spheres . in sec.[sec : rlp ] , following onoda and liniger@xcite , we define as random loose volume fraction @xmath2 the volume fraction which is attained in the limit of infinitesimally slow energy minimization , and determine its value for frictionless spheres in no gravity .",

    "in this section , we introduce the numerical model , give the definition of zero pressure jammed packings of spheres , and describe the protocols used to generate jammed packings of spheres .",
    "we consider a system of monodisperse frictionless soft spheres of diameter @xmath25 , and mass @xmath26 , interacting with an harmonic potential @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 specifies the position of particle @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the distance between particles @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath33 are our units of length , mass and energy , respectively .",

    "we consider a configuration jammed when the mean energy per particle is higher than a small threshold , @xmath38 . in principle , the definition of jamming we are considering allows for the presence of particles with no contacts ( rattlers ) .",
    "however , in the infinite system size limit their concentration is known to vanish@xcite .     illustration of the possible states resulting from an energy minimization protocol . these states can be jammed with a finite energy , jammed with zero energy ( transition states ) , or unjammed with zero energy . ]",
    "jammed packings of spheres correspond to minima of the energy of the system @xmath39 .",
    "we sample these minima solving the equation of motion of the system in the presence of a viscous damping term , as if the particles were immersed in a viscous fluid , starting from a random ( infinite temperature ) configuration .",
    "each particle evolves according to : @xmath40 where the parameter @xmath41 plays the role of a viscosity .",
    "as time goes on , the total energy of the system decreases because of the dissipative term , and the dynamics eventually stops ( the kinetic energy vanishes ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimization ] , the resulting state will be either jammed with zero energy , or jammed with a finite energy .",
    "the figure also illustrates the existence of transition states , jammed states of zero energy .",
    "energy minima may be found using other protocols , as for instance simulated annealing , in which the system is coupled to a heat bath whose temperature is decreased until it vanishes .",
    "alternatively , one could consider the minimization of the energy of the system using as initial state an equilibrium configuration at a given value of the temperature : this is the protocol used to unveil the features of the energy landscape sampled by glass  forming liquids@xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the role of the parameter @xmath41 in the energy minimization procedure is easily understood .",
    "when @xmath41 is high , the kinetic energy of the system is small , which implies that the system is less able to escape from the energy basins it visits .",
    "accordingly , the larger @xmath41 the smaller the region of the configurational space the system explores before getting trapped in a energy basin . in particular , in the limit @xmath42 the system jams in the first minimum it enters .",
    "conversely , at a finite value of @xmath41 , the system may reach a minimum of the potential energy with a finite value of the kinetic energy , and may therefore be able to escape from it overcoming the confining energy barriers .",
    "the average value of the energy of the minima reached with a given value of @xmath41 is therefore expected to decrease as @xmath41 decreases .",
    "onoda and liniger@xcite operatively defined @xmath2 as the smallest volume fraction attained via sedimentation protocols under gravity . since sedimentation is an energy ( gravitational energy ) minimization protocol , this operative definition can be extended to the absence of gravity , simply defining @xmath2 as the smallest volume fraction of jammed states obtained via energy minimization protocols , the initial state being a random one .",
    "this jammed state of large volume fraction is obtained solving the equations of motion eq .",
    "[ eq : dissipation ] in the limit @xmath42 , in the infinite time limit .",
    "operatively , this state can be also obtained via more tractable numerical procedures able to find energy minima , namely the steepest descend method , or the equivalent but computationally more performant conjugate gradient ( cg ) method .",
    "here we use the fletcher  reeves cg algorithm , as implemented in the gnu scientific library  @xcite .",
    "the cg is characterized by two parameters .",
    "first , there is a tolerance small parameter , which is used to decide when the minimization along a given direction of the configurational space stops .",
    "afterwards , the algorithm tries to minimize the energy moving the system along a conjugate direction of the phase space . in the minimization of the energy @xmath43",
    "we have not found a dependence of the results on this parameter , when this is small enough .",
    "second , there is a threshold parameter @xmath44 : the algorithm stops when the energy difference between two successive iterations is smaller than this threshold . here",
    "we set @xmath45 , meaning that the algorithm stops when the energy variation in successive iterations is smaller than our numerical precision .",
    "we note that zero  energy jammed packings obtained via the cg method have been previously@xcite identified with @xmath3 , while here we identify them with @xmath2 .",
    "we comment on this point later on .",
