    "compact stellar mass objects emit gravitational waves in the good sensitivity band of the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) during their last year of inspiral into a supermassive black hole .",
    "the gravitational waveforms of emris , extreme mass ratio insiprals , are therefore of interest , and when observed may shed light on the spacetime of the central black hole , including testing the kerr hypothesis @xcite , in addition to being a sensitive tool to measure the central black hole s parameters .",
    "this possibility makes such sources of gravitational waves extremely interesting , despite the relatively low number of sources expected during the lifetime of the lisa mission .",
    "specifically , tens to hundreds of such sources are expected to redshifts of @xmath1@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the solution of the two body problem in general relativity remains challenging , and emris orbits and waveforms correspond to its solution in the extreme mass ratio limit .",
    "construction of theoretical templates is important both for detection of emris gravitational waves and for accurate parameter estimation .",
    "numerical waveforms can be constructed using the frequency ",
    "domain ( fd ) or the time  domain ( td ) approaches .",
    "the former approach has been developed to very high accuracy , and is considered robust and accurate . on the other hand , advances to the td approach have been hindered first by the success of the fd approach @xcite , and by the crudity of the initial attempts to evolve numerically the fields coupled to a point - like source with the teukolsky equation @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough in the accuracy of td solutions of the inhomogeneous teukolsky equation , i.e. , the 2 + 1d solution of the teukolsky equation coupled to a point mass , was recently achieved in @xcite .",
    "for the first time , it was shown that td calculations can be as accurate as fd calculations .",
    "the td method of @xcite was improved with the introduction of the  discrete delta \" model of the source @xcite and an appropriate low pass filter that makes the discrete delta useful also for eccentric or inclined orbits @xcite .",
    "specifically , correlation integrals of gravitational waveforms done for the same system in the fd and td approaches show that the two agree to a high level @xcite .",
    "one may therefore argue that the two methods are comparable in the results they are capable of producing .",
    "we therefore contend that the viewpoint that the td solution of the inhomogeneous teukolsky equations is far from being competitive from the fd solution can no longer be supported .",
    "however , we believe that one should not seek competition of the two approaches , but rather how they complement each other , as either method has non - overlapping strengths . in order to achieve this goal",
    "one needs to compare the computational efficiency of the two approaches .",
    "the question of the efficiency and the computation time with which the results are obtained remains an open question though .",
    "the common wisdom is that the fd computation is more effective computationally than its td counterpart : fd approaches are particularly convenient when the system and the emitted gravitational waves exhibits a discrete set of frequencies .",
    "indeed , as shown by schmidt  @xcite and by drasco and hughes  @xcite , all bound kerr orbits have a simple , discrete spectrum of orbital frequencies .",
    "however , generic orbits and in particular high - eccentricity orbits , although in principle amenable to a fourier decomposition and a fd construction of the waveforms , require the summation of many terms in the fourier series .",
    "this problem limits the accuracy and increases the computation time in fd calculations . while this statement , or similar ones , appear in the literature @xcite , it has not been quantified .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to study the relative computational efficiency of fd and td codes for the solution of the inhomogeneous teukolsky equation .",
    "specifically , we study the question of how much computational time is needed to find the fluxes of energy and angular momentum to infinity from an eccentric and equatorial orbit around a fast spinning kerr black hole .",
    "we restrict the analysis here to equatorial orbits .",
    "analysis of equatorial orbits is non - trivial , and teaches much of the method and properties also of non - equatorial orbits .",
    "analysis of non equatorial orbits increases considerably the volume of the parameter space , and we leave its study to the future .",
    "we do , nevertheless , comment on the analysis of generic orbits .",
    "the estimation of the total needed computation time for td codes is relatively simple : after the desired accuracy level is set , one needs to estimate the number of azimuthal @xmath0 modes ( associated with the @xmath3 orbital angular frequency ) required for the total sum over @xmath0 modes to achieve the desired accuracy , and then compute each @xmath0 mode at the same accuracy level .",
    "the number of needed @xmath0 modes is not hard to estimate , because the partial fluxes approach a geometric progression in @xmath0 for large @xmath0 values , with the asymptotic factor between two successive partial fluxes depending on the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "after the needed number of @xmath0 modes is determined , one can use the td code of @xcite ( possibly with the improvements included in @xcite ) to calculate the partial fluxes and sum over them . using the asymptotic geometric progression structure",
    "one may also estimate the error associated with the summation over the partial fluxes , and verify that the desired accuracy level is indeed achieved .",
    "this is done in section [ m_modes ] .",
    "the td calculation of the individual partial fluxes can be done more efficiently than a straightforward calculation of the fields to very late times and great distances , that are required for an accurate estimate of the fluxes at infinity .",
    "specifically , one can make use of the peeling properties of the weyl scalars at great distances , and fit the fields at finite distances to that behavior .",
    "one may then use the fitted behavior to extract the behavior at infinity .",
    "this is done in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "we find this method to be cleaner and better motivated physically than the fit done in @xcite , that uses a general two ",
    "parameter fit function of a form which is not strongly motivated physically .",
    "the estimation of the total needed computation time for fd codes starts similarly to the td analysis : specifically , one needs to first determine the number of @xmath0 modes needed for the determined accuracy level .",
    "this can be done in a similar way to how it is done in the td .",
    "the calculation of each @xmath0 mode in the fd approach requires the summation over a number of @xmath4 modes , that correspond to the radial and angular ( about the equatorial plane ) orbital angular frequencies and the radiative multipole @xmath5 . because we focus attention on equatorial plane orbits , the @xmath6 modes trivialize , and in practice only the @xmath7 modes are of importance .",
    "we find in section [ k_mode ] that the number of @xmath7 modes that one needs to sum over to achieve the desired accuracy level increases with the eccentricity and with the corresponding value of @xmath0 in an intricate manner .",
    "next , in section [ comp_time ] we estimate the computation time of each @xmath7 mode , and find it is a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of the computation time of the @xmath7 mode is found to have a rather intricate dependence of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "we use this behavior to approximate the computation time over a sum of @xmath7 modes up to some @xmath8 , and argue it is approximately quadratic in @xmath8 for high @xmath8 values .",
    "then , in section [ compare ] we find the total computation time for all the fd modes on the same machine on which we perform the td computation , and compare the two .",
    "we find that the fd code is more efficient at low @xmath0 values ( for a twofold reason : because those require few @xmath7 modes , and for low @xmath0 values each @xmath7 mode takes less time to compute ) , but the computation time increases rapidly with the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we find the growth rate of the computation time with the mode number @xmath0 to increase as a power of @xmath0 , with the value of the exponent increasing with the eccentricity .",
    "finally , we estimate that for generic orbits the two methods become comparable already for moderately high values of the eccentricity , in the range of @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "higher eccentricity orbits are more efficiently calculated using the td approach .",
    "even when the calculation of the sum of all @xmath0 modes is done more efficiently using one method over the other , one may still compute the low @xmath0 modes using the fd approach and the high @xmath0 modes using the td approach .",
    "such a hybrid method may prove to be the most efficient computationally .",
    "one should also consider the fact that the total needed number of @xmath7 modes is an empirically found number .",
    "when the full parameter space is mapped , one may tabulate the numbers of required modes as functions of the orbital parameters . until this is done",
    ", extra computation time is needed to find the number of needed modes , including the computation of some modes that are found _ a posteriori _ to be unneeded .",
    "no similar problem occurs in the td approach .",
    "to obtain the sum over all @xmath0 modes we need to obtain results for high @xmath0numbers , and find a way to determine ( i ) how many @xmath0 modes we need to sum over to get the total flux to a certain pre - determined accuracy , and ( ii ) estimate the error in neglecting all the higher @xmath0 modes . in the case of circular and equatorial orbits , finn & thorne @xcite show that ( see @xcite for more details and for definitions ) @xmath11 ^ 2}\\,\\eta^2{\\tilde \\omega}^{2",

    "( notably , this property depends on the factor of @xmath14 . )",
    "we may therefore approximate the sum over infinitely many modes by taking the series to be a geometric progression .    for eccentric orbits",
    "we no longer have the finn ",
    "thorne formula , but we can do numerical experiments to test whether the same results holds also for such orbits . we first show in table [ table5 ] the average fluxes obtain for a number of eccentric orbits ( with a fixed value of the semilatus rectum @xmath15 ) as a function of the mode @xmath0 . the data presented is table [ table5 ] is intentionally coarse , and is not intended to be more accurate than at the 510% level .",
    "below , we also present similar data with higher accuracy , where the latter are needed .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xmath16 as a function of @xmath0 for several eccentric orbits .",
    "we see that for all values of @xmath17 , the drop off rate is exponential in @xmath0 for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "notably , the highest flux is in the fundamental mode , @xmath18 , and is highest for @xmath19 .",

    "another improvement of efficiency of the fd code may come from improvements of the burlisch ",

    "it is currently unknown how the computational efficiency and numerical accuracy would be affected by such a change .",
    "one factor that limits a possible reduction of the td computation time is the need to average over an orbital ( radial ) period to find the average flux per period . even for the strong field orbit considered here , with @xmath100 and @xmath128 ,",
    "the radial period is @xmath211 , which puts a lower bound on how short the computational integration can be .",
    "one could perhaps shorten the computation time if only half an orbital period is computed , but because the phase of the orbit at the end of the spurious wave epoch is arbitrary , on the average at least three quarters of an orbit need to be computed .",

    "when generic orbits are considered , finding the number of @xmath5 modes required to achieve a set accuracy level with the fd approach becomes a non - trivial problem , as is the question of finding the computational time of each @xmath5 mode as a function of the mode number .",
    "notably , the td calculations remain unchanged , as is the associated computation time .",
    "we therefore expect the fd computation time to increase significantly with the transition from equatorial to inclined and then generic orbits , an increase that has no counterpart in the td case .",
