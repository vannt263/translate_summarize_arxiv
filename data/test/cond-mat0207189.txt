    "particles which locally strongly interact with their environment polarize this latter and finish up in self - trapped states . on a local level , the environment surrounding the particles can be described in terms of a coherent superposition ( in form of glauber states ) of the elementary bosonic excitations of the bare environment . as a result , new composite entities form , given by the charge carriers and their surrounding clouds of bosonic excitations of the environment .",
    "it is at present a matter of dispute whether in the normal state such composite entities can exist as itinerant bloch - like states or are purely diffusive .",
    "the retarded interaction between the charge carriers and the bosonic excitations of the environment favors the picture of diffusive motion caused by a dephasing of the dynamics of the two constituents .",
    "the question we want to address here is whether this process of dephasing can be blocked , leading to a delocalization when such self - trapped composite entities condense into a _ macroscopic _ coherent quantum state .",
    "we investigate such a possibility in terms of a model of very general form , given by bosonic charge carriers strongly coupled to local bosonic excitations of the environment .",
    "the bosonic charge carriers can , amongst others , represent electron pairs induced by strong electron - phonon or electron - spin fluctuation interaction , electron pairs in double valence fluctuation systems ( stabilized by their ligand environment ) , frenkel excitons ( stabilized by their interaction with the surrounding lattice deformations ) and , in a more remote sense , he@xmath0 atoms in a bath of he@xmath1 with whose excitations they interact .",
    "such bosonic entities can in principle condense into a superfluid state .",
    "our interest here is to show how in such a _ macroscopic _ coherent quantum state the internal structure of the _ local _ coherent quantum state of the bosonic excitations of the environment is modified .",
    "we shall investigate this problem on the basis of a model of itinerant electrons , coupled to some purely local vibrational modes .",
    "for moderately strong and strong coupling , it results in self - trapped composite entities , given by on - site electron pairs , surrounded by local lattice deformations which are described by clouds of phonons in local coherent quantum states . in the intermediate coupling limit these localized entities can be considered as two - particle resonant states of the underlying system of itinerant electrons .",
    "they form out of pairs of such uncorrelated itinerant electrons and ultimately decay into them .",

    "this model is based on a conjecture , rather than on a derivation from an underlying basic electron - phonon hamiltonian , such as for instance the holstein model@xcite .",
    "we shall in the following develop the ideas which had initially led us to this conjecture .",
    "let us start from a simple holstein model with purely local einstein modes for the lattice vibrations .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath22 the meaning of the various operators and coupling constants is the same as in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , except for the value of @xmath23 which is equal to @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath25 denotes some effective coulomb repulsion - not to be confused with a hubbard - type on - site interaction - on the effective sites , which , we stress again , ought to be considered as being composed of small molecular clusters such as a diatomic molecular unit or similar .",
    "electrons described by this hamiltonian can gain energy either by becoming itinerant and remaining essentially uncoupled to the lattice or , alternatively , getting self - trapped . in the first case",
    "the energy gain is described by the intrinsic band dispersion @xmath26 @xmath27 denoting lattice vectors linking nearest - neighbor sites . for self - trapped polaronic states ,",
    "the local part of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be transformed by a shift in the phonon variables @xmath28 upon which it acquires the form @xmath29 with the polaron binding energy @xmath30 denoting the gain in energy by the corresponding polaron level shift .",
    "the effective on - site interaction given by @xmath31 controls the possible formation of bipolaronic states @xmath32 when @xmath33 , with the single polaron states lying above such bipolaron states . for @xmath34",
    "we have the inverse situation with the bipolaronic level lying above that of the single polarons .",
    "what we are interested here is the first case .",
    "let us begin by considering the situation of sufficiently strong interaction such that the bipolaronic level lies below the bottom of the unrenormalized electron band , i.e. , for @xmath35 , as illustrated in fig.1",
    ". in that case bipolarons can acquire itinerancy by decaying into virtual states of pairs of itinerant electrons and reassembling subsequently on some neighbouring site . within the usual lang - firsov approximation , neglecting phonon creation as well as annihilation processes during the charge transfer from one site to the other , the corresponding effective bipolaron hopping integral is then given by @xmath36@xcite . within",
    "this approximation one obtains a system of itinerant bipolarons on a lattice which , at low temperatures , can condense into a superfluid state , giving rise to what has been termed _",
    "bipolaronic superconductivity_. this theoretical proposition has ever since remained a matter of dispute , questioning if such a normal - state itinerant bose liquid can be achieved in real materials .",
    "the main arguments against it is that the stability of local bipolarons requires a relatively high value of @xmath37 for realistic values of @xmath38 , @xmath25 and @xmath14 and hence leads to exceedingly small values of the bipolaron bandwidth .",
    "a further hampering factor for the realization of such bipolaronic itinerant band states is related to the retardation effects between the motion of the charge carriers and the lattice deformations which surround them .",
    "this gives rise to dephasing between the two , as shown by exact diagonalization approaches@xcite and dmrg studies@xcite , indicating that incoherent processes in the optical conductivity are dominant .",
    "all these results suggest that coherent bipolaron motion is most unlikely to occur in real systems and it was for that reason that the boson - fermion model was initially proposed@xcite .",
    "the aim was to capture the physics outside the regime of the extreme strong coupling antiadiabatic limit and to describe the intermediate coupling case , where the bipolaron level lies inside the band of the itinerant electrons ( see fig.2 ) and where the superconducting state is controlled by the phase correlations of these resonant bosonic bipolaron states .",
    "quite generally , this model can be considered as a paradigm for cross - over situations . for the specific case",
    "we are interested here , it describes a cross - over between a bcs - type superconductor of cooper pairs in the weak coupling regime and the hypothetical , yet to be experimentally verified , _ bipolaronic superconductivity _ in the strong coupling regime . in a totally different physical situation ,",
    "namely that of a strongly correlated electron system such as described by the hubbard model , it has been recently shown that the intermediate coupling case can be mapped onto such a boson - fermion scenario@xcite .",
    "such an effective boson - fermion hamiltonian was also derived recently for the exchange interaction between spinon singlets of the rvb electron - pairs and holons@xcite .",
    "the question to what extent such a bfm can emerge from a quite general class of interacting fermion systems , has been addressed from the point of view of a bosonization procedure of an intrinsically fermionic system@xcite .",
    "the presently much discussed molecular bose - einstein condensate , involving entangled atoms in squeezed states has also recently been analyzed@xcite in the framework of such a bfm .",
    "a derivation of the bfm for moderately strongly coupled electron - phonon systems , starting from the holstein model , is so far not available . in order to provide the physically intuitive picture which initially had led us to propose this model ,",
    "let us consider the case where the local bipolaron states are stable relative to single polarons .",
    "this eventuality can only be decided on the basis of direct experimental evidence for such local bipolaronic entities .",
    "the classical cases which initially had led to consider such a situation are systems like amorphous semiconductors@xcite , ti@xmath39o@xmath40@xcite , na@xmath41v@xmath42o@xmath43@xcite , wo@xmath44@xcite and double valence fluctuation systems@xcite like pbte(tl ) , just to name a few of them , and all of which represent such bipolarons as _ exclusively _ localized self - trapped states .    when these systems are doped , the electrons responsible for pairing are at the same time responsible for the - albeit diffusive - transport .",
    "it is hence tempting to hypothesize that such bipolaronic states can occur as resonant states inside a band of itinerant electrons . in more complex systems , such as ternary and quaternary compounds , different electrons come into play .",
    "some of them are prone to form bipolarons and others will remain itinerant , but being coupled together via some hybridization term . in systems like that ,",
    "such a boson - fermion scenario imposes itself more directly .",
    "it is the eventuality of bipolaronic resonant states rather than localized states , which was at the origin of our proposal of the boson - fermion scenario@xcite .",
    "the level scheme for the local bipolaronic states inside the band of the bare itinerant electrons for this situation is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "filling up such a system gradually with electrons , it is evident from fig.2 that , as long as the fermi level remains below the level of the local bipolaronic states , the charge carriers will be essentially bare itinerant electrons . but upon further increasing the concentration of charge carriers , the itinerant electrons will eventually overlap in energy with the intrinsically localized bipolaronic level .",
    "the major supposition leading to this bfm is now to assume that this overlap can be simulated by some effective on - site hybridization describing a charge exchange between the bipolarons and pairs of itinerant electrons in the form of @xmath45 \\ ; , \\ ] ] with the itinerant electrons and the localized bipolarons , eq.(5 ) , treated as commuting fields .",
    "such a supposition is supported by the fact that the spectrum of electrons , moderately strongly coupled to local modes , is known to be given by the bare spectrum for all @xmath46-vectors , except where their energy crosses the level of localized selftrapped electrons . in this regime of energies",
    "the electron spectrum is strongly modified , as shown by exact diagonalization studies@xcite as well as variational methods@xcite , with the spectrum becoming rather flat and approaching the local level of the self - trapped polaronic states .",
    "these are features which are characteristic of systems where itinerant charge carriers are hybridized with localized charge carriers , and this was the center of our initial assumption of an effective hybridization between localized bipolarons and pairs of itinerant electrons , as given by eq.(6 ) .    on a local level the dynamics of a polaronic system , involving two - particle resonant states , is controlled by the atomic limit of such a system , which we thus propose to describe by the following hamiltonian    @xmath47 + \\sum_i \\hbar \\omega_0 \\left(a^{+}_ia_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ) \\\\ & \\equiv & ( u-2\\mu ) \\sum_i",

    "local hamiltonian the term describing the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons , leads immediately to the bfm hamiltonian given by eq.(1 ) .",
    "the basic physics contained in this bfm model originates from a competition of the local electron pairing , acting as a prerequisite for superconductivity , with the delocalizing effect of the itinerant electrons which favors non - local cooper pairing as the temperature is lowered and the superconducting phase is approached . the change - over from local pairing to cooper pairing",
    "is not only manifest in the electronic properties of such systems but is expected to be accompanied by corresponding lattice deformations , the study of which is the issue of the present paper .    we shall examine this feature for the two following extreme limits :    \\i ) the normal - state phase , characterized by the existence of a pseudogap in the density of states ( dos ) of the itinerant electrons , which will be treated here in an approximate fashion within the atomic limit of the bfm ,    \\ii ) the superconducting phase , which will be treated on a mean - field level , taking into account the phase locking of the bound electron pairs .    throughout this study",
    "we choose as a representative example a set of parameters presenting a situation close to the fully symmetric case .",
    "this implies an effective bipolaron level ( corresponding to the energy level for the bound pairs ) given by @xmath51 , resulting in a final state bipolarons level lying close to the center of the band of the itinerant electrons , after the boson - phonon coupling has been switched on . we moreover want to consider the case @xmath52 , giving a concentration of electrons @xmath53 and a concentration of bound pairs @xmath54 and choose @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "the coherent superposition of deformed and undeformed oscillator states in the ground state is a direct consequence of the macroscopic phase locking of the composite bosonic states in the superconducting phase , resulting from the variational ground state of @xmath112 of the form @xmath144 the operators @xmath145 are defined as @xmath146 and differ significantly from the usual polaron shift operators @xmath147 , characterizing the deformations of a simply shifted oscillator state .",

    "the pdf in the superconducting phase is given by @xmath153     in the superconducting phase ( full lines ) into the contributions @xmath154 coming from the ground state ( dashed ) and @xmath155 coming from the first excited state ( pointed ) of @xmath112.,width=264 ]    in fig.[pdf0 ] we compare the pdf in the normal state and in the superconducting phase for different temperatures .",
    "the features examined above on the basis of the composition of @xmath128 are perfectly reflected in the pdf . in",
    "the normal state one observes a single peak at some finite @xmath94 , indicative of well defined shifted oscillator states . in the superconducting phase , on the contrary , one observes a weakly temperature dependent double - peak structure , which , as we can see from fig.[pdf2 ] , arises essentially from two contributions associated with the ground state and the first excited state of @xmath112 . at temperatures just below @xmath140 this double - peak structure results from an incoherent superposition of these two states , corresponding to a situation where localized bipolarons are randomly distributed over the lattice .",
    "the statistical distribution of empty and doubly occupied sites will thus give rise to that double - peak structure .",
    "in the limit of low temperature , on the contrary , the pdf arises @xmath156 from the ground state , with a peak centered near @xmath101 ( being determined by the coefficients @xmath143 ) and a peak centered around a finite value of @xmath94 ( being determined by the coefficients @xmath142 ) .",
    "the appearence of a double - peak structure in the pdf has long since been recognized as a signature of delocalization of the charge carriers in polaronic systems@xcite .",
    "the present study shows that , as the superconducting state sets in and is strengthened upon lowering the temperature , the _ macroscopic _ phase coherence of the system not only involves the charge carriers but also the deformations which surround them .",
    "this is only possible if at @xmath84 these deformations are controlled by a single quantum state , i.e. , the ground state @xmath157 .",
    "the superconductivity - induced delocalization of the self - trapped entities which characterize the normal state , is caused by the locking together of the local lattice deformations in a coherent superposition of deformed and essentially undeformed oscillator states , resulting in the developement of a double - peak structure in the pdf .",
    "at least in the scenario presented here , this result does not bear out any undressings@xcite of the charge carriers , stripping off partially the phonon clouds , as one enters the superconducting phase .",
    "such an effect would show up in a pdf which , in the superconducting phase , would be given by essentially a single - peak structure centered around @xmath101 .",
    "the discussion in the previous section demonstrated the qualitative difference which exists between some basic lattice properties in the normal and the superconducting phase , and largely being controlled by the induced electron pairing in the subsystem of the intrinsically uncorrelated itinerant electrons .",
    "what results is a competition between the local pairing , characterizing the normal - state phase , and the * k*-space pairing in the superconducting phase , expected to be particularly relevant around the superconducting transition where the spatial phase fluctuations play a major role and residual local electron pairing@xcite persists in the superconducting phase .",
    "the qualitative difference in the structure of the pdf in the two phases leads us to expect squeezing effects of the local coherent phonon quantum states which are stronger in the pseudogap phase than in the superconducting phase . associated with it",
    ", one should expect larger fluctuations of the local deformations of the environment and of the momenta of the ions representing it .",
    "these fluctuations are given by @xmath158 with @xmath159    the expectation values in eq.([xp ] ) have to be calculated with respect to the eigenvectors of @xmath59 and @xmath160 for , respectively , for the normal and the superconducting phase .",
    "the results for these fluctuations in the two phases are illustrated in fig.[dxdp ] .",
    "in particular , the product @xmath161 clearly shows that the coherent phonon states in the normal state are considerably squeezed , i.e. , this product is for @xmath162 very close to the lower limit of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , equal to @xmath163 . in the superconducting phase , on the contrary , we observe practically no squeezing effect with decreasing temperature , the product @xmath164 being always bigger than what would be expected in the normal state in this temperature regime .",
    "a possible experimental verification of these features comes from neutron absorption measurements@xcite which measure the kinetic energy @xmath165 of the local lattice vibrations .",
    "indeed , the experimental results shown that , as the temperature is reduced , @xmath166 saturates in the superconducting phase and is distinctly above the values expected in the normal state at the same temperature .",
    "this fact is born out in our study , as can be seen by inspection of fig.[dxdp](b ) .",

    "( c ) degree of the squeezing of the coherent phonon states as a function of @xmath169.,width=264 ]    finally , an issue which ought to be of crucial interest in studying the lattice properties connected with the onset of the superconducting order or of the electron pairing at @xmath63 in the normal state , is the question of the changes in the phonon spectral properties upon going from one phase to the other .",
    "strong changes in the frequency of specific local modes , induced by strong electron - phonon coupling , have been well established by photoinduced infrared absorption measurements@xcite and been related to strong local displacements of the ions . in this context , the appearence of new additional modes occuring with changes from the normal into the superconducting phase have also been reported , although this is still a matter of debate@xcite .",
    "more established are the strong intensity changes of certain raman active modes and the strong frequency renormalizations and lifetime broadening occuring at such transitions@xcite .",
    "such effects can best be studied by energy loss spectra in inelastic neutron scattering or raman spectroscopy where phonons are emitted .",
    "the cross - section for it is given by @xmath170 with @xmath171        here @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonians @xmath59 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "we illustrate the results of such phonon emission spectra for the two phases in figs .",
    "[ ph1 ] and [ ph2 ] .",
    "quite generally , one observes a quasi - elastic contribution at frequency zero , which is the standard signature of coherent phonon states .",
    "as the temperature is lowered below either @xmath63 or @xmath140 and the itinerant electrons get correlated by local pairing in the normal state or by cooper pairing in the superconducting phase , the local phonon mode first splits into several modes and finally evolves into a well defined mode which is softer in the pseudogap phase and harder in the superconducting phase .",
    "these features of the phonon spectral properties are expected to hold qualitatively true .",
    "a quantitative link - up between the normal phase and the superconducting phase as the temperature is decreased , would require a full description of the local boson - fermion exchange correlations , incorporating the electron itinerancy in the normal state and allowing for local electron pairing in the superconducting phase .",
    "these are presently largely unresolved fundamental problems in such system where amplitude and phase order occur independently , as in the high - temperature superconductors with its pseudogap phase above @xmath140 where local electron pairing persists in an incoherent fashion .",
    "the present study is an attempt to examine the condensed state of a system of composite particles such as charge carriers surrounded by clouds of bosonic excitations of the neighboring environment to which they are coupled and to see to what extent a macroscopic coherent quantum state can be induced in the system of these bosonic excitations . as a specific example we chose a system of electrons ,",
    "moderately strongly coupled to local lattice deformations , which can be described in terms of resonant local - pair states ( localized bipolarons ) inside a fermi sea of essentially uncorrelated itinerant electrons with which they interact via a charge exchange term .",
    "we find noticeable qualitative differences in the structure of the local coherent quantum states of the phonons in the superconducting phase and in the phase above it which corresponds to a normal state characterized by a pseudogap in the dos of the single - particle spectrum .",
    "several measurable quantities related to static and dynamic lattice properties were examined , such as the pair distribution function , the fluctuations in the lattice positions and the corresponding ion kinetic energies of the atoms making up such a lattice and , finally , the phonon spectral properties given by energy - loss spectroscopy ( measurable by inelastic neutron scattering or raman spectroscopy ) .",
    "the difference between local electron pairing in the normal state and * k*-space pairing in the superconducting phase has noticeable consequences on such measurable quantities , resulting in ( @xmath4 ) a single - peak structure of the pdf in the normal state and a double - peak structure in the superconducting phase , ( @xmath135 ) distinctively larger positional fluctuations and kinetic energy of the atomic clusters ( making up the lattice ) in the superconducting phase than in the normal state and , ( @xmath174 ) associated with it , a more effective squeezing of the phonon coherent quantum states in that latter .",
    "for the superconducting phase , the present mean - field study is restricted to local phase fluctuations of the superconducting state given by a generalization of a phase - locked state of bosons on a lattice , eqs.(17,18,22 ) , in which these bosons correspond to composite particles in form of bipolarons [ see eq.(5 ) ] .",
    "the examination of soundwave - like collective excitations of such a system is planned for some future work . there",
    ", the question arises if the local dynamical deformations do get spatially correlated upon entering the superconducting state , as possibly suggested by ion channeling experiments@xcite .",
    "a possible approach to solve this problem could be to integrate out the fermionic sector of the bfm hamiltonian eq.(1 ) , resulting in a gross - pitaevskii lagrangian@xcite for the effective itinerant bosonic charge carriers coupled to the phonons , followed by a treatment similar to that adopted for bosons on a defromable lattice@xcite .",
