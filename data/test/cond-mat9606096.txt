    "it is very well known that the creation of a surface gives origin to new electronic states in the material , these states are called _ surface states_. the surface states are in the gaps of the projected bulk bands and have two dimensional ( 2d ) character . recently we have given a theoretical description of the @xmath0 band in cdte(100 ) ( 1 ) , and we found that this band is of 2d character but does exist in atomic layers away from the surface , it is in this sense a _ bulk band _ , not a surface state .",
    "the appearance of this band is a consequence of the creation of the ( 100 ) surface . in the present work we made a systematic study of the valence band electronic structure of the ( 100 ) surface in the iii  v zinc blende semiconductors , with the purpose to determine if the character of the 2d bulk band found in cdte(100 ) is universal .    an experimental technique capable of identifying absolute critical point energies and the dispersion of valence band is angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "arpes has been very successful in the investigation of iv , iii ",
    "vi , and iv  vi semiconductor compounds ( 2 ) .",
    "v semiconductor compounds have been subject of extensive studies in the past , in particular the ( 100 ) surface of the zinc blende compounds gaas ( 3 ) , gasb ( 4 ) , and insb ( 5 ) .",
    "the experimental reports give account of the surface states in the valence band and in some cases other structures no reported previously .",
    "it is in the last point that our work is focussed . using the tight binding method ( 6 ) ( tbm ) with the surface green s function matching method ( 7 ) ( sgfm ) we calculate the bulk band structure projected on the ( 100 ) surface and we compare it with the experimental data .",
    "the sgfm method allows us to determine the origin of all those states ( 1,7 ) .",
    "in order to study the ( 100 ) surface we use the sgfm method and calculate the ( 100 ) bulk projected ( @xmath1 ) and the ( 100 ) surface projected ( @xmath2 ) green s function . from @xmath3  we can calculate the effects on the band structure coming from the hard wall effect ( in close analogy to the hard core term in scattering theory , see ref .",
    "( 8) ) and from @xmath4  we obtain the surface band structure . to calculate these green s functions we use the known formula @xmath5 @xmath6 the way in which the hamiltonian matrices @xmath7 are related to the tbm",
    "is described in detail in ref .",
    "( 9 ) . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transfer matrices depending only on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , the principal layer projected hamiltonian matrices ( for further discussion see refs .",
    "( 7 , 8) ) .",
    "by looking at the poles of the real part of the green s function , we found the eigenvalues for each value of * k * , a vector in the brillouin zone . in this way we have calculated the surface states and the 2d bulk states in the ( 100 ) surface of the iii ",
    "v semiconductor compounds . in general , we obtain two surface resonances , the first one with anion terminated surface character and the second one with cation terminated surface character .",
    "we have three 2d bulk states and one bulk resonance state .",
    "these states appear in the band structure due to the breaking of the crystal translational symmetry in the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "the creation of the surface gives origin to new states in the electronic structure , both surface and bulk states , as those discussed in a recent work for ii ",
    "vi compounds ( 1 , 1012 ) .",
    "we present a brief discussion of our results in the gaas(100 ) , gasb(100 ) , and insb(100 ) compounds . here",
    "we only discuss the gaas(100 ) surface and for the other compounds we make a brief mention of the principal characteristics found in our calculation , a more extensive discussion will be published elsewhere .",
    "figure 1 shows our calculated band structure , in the @xmath13 direction , for gaas(100 ) . in the figure",
    "we show the bulk band structure ( solid lines ) , the surface resonances ( triangles ) , and the 2d bulk states ( points ) .",
    "epsf    projected ( 100 ) surface band structure for gaas .",
    "we show the bulk bands ,    -6pt labeled 1 , 2 , and 3 ( solid lines ) , the surface resonances ( triangles ) , and the 2d bulk states ( points ) .",
    "the broken lines are only guide to the eye .",
    "we identify the bulk bands calculated by chelikowsky and cohen ( 13 ) , by the solid lines .",
    "we found these bulk bands after the diagonalization of the bulk tight binding hamiltonian with the parameters of the ref .",
    "the surface resonances and the 2d bulk states have been obtained looking at the poles of the real part of the surface green s function ( rpsgf ) and the poles of the real part of the bulk green s function ( rpbgf ) , respectively , in the same way as is discussed in refs .",
    "the @xmath14 surface resonance , labeled @xmath15 by olde  ( 3 ) ( see fig . 1 from ref . ( 3 ) ) , appears due to the creation of the surface in the material and it is characteristic of the anion terminated surface .",
    "the state begins at the top of the valence band in @xmath16 and shows some dispersion in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the @xmath17 surface resonance , that shows larger dispersion than the @xmath14 resonance , begins at 2.9 ev in @xmath16 and reaches @xmath18 at 6.1 ev , approximately .",
    "this state is characteristic of the cation terminated surface . on the other hand , we obtain three 2d bulk states , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in the gaas(100 ) surface .",
    "the @xmath21 state is located at 2.9 ev , the @xmath22 state at 3.3 ev , and the @xmath20 state at 7.6 ev , approximately .",
    "these states do not show dispersion .",
    "the 2d bulk states appear for both , the anion terminated and cation terminated , surfaces .",
    "finally , we have the @xmath23 state at 9.9 ev , this state shows slight dispersion and we identify it as a bulk resonance state .",
    "the state is a bulk resonance because this state mixes with the projected band structure , the projection of the bulk band @xmath24 for each * k * in the surface brillouin zone , at @xmath16 and goes to the forbidden gap for * k * values near @xmath18 ( 15 ) . according to this ,",
    "we suggest the next theoretical description of the band structure reported by olde  ( 3 ) : the @xmath14 surface resonance could be the @xmath15 experimental band , one of our 2d bulk states , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , could be the @xmath25 band , the @xmath17 surface resonance could be identified as the @xmath26 band , and the @xmath20 state with the @xmath27 band . from the experimental report it is not possible to see if the bulk resonance state @xmath23 has an experimental counterpart . the calculated band structure for gasb(100 ) and",
    "insb(100 ) shows the same pattern as gaas(100 ) .",
    "we obtain the surface resonances @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the 2d bulk states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as well as the bulk resonance state @xmath32 .",
    "we could made a similar identification , as in the gaas(100 ) case , of our calculated states using the experimental reports of franklin _",
    "et al . _ ( 4 ) and middelmann _ et al . _ ( 5 ) for gasb(100 ) and insb(100 ) , respectively .",
    "however , we do not present further discussions here . a more extensive discussion will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have studied the electronic structure of the ( 100 ) surface of the zinc blende semiconductor compounds gaas , gasb , and insb that have been experimentally obtained using angle  resolved photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "we used an empirical tight binding description and the surface green s function matching method to obtain the bulk bands and the electronic structure projected on the surface . from the green s function",
    "we have established the character of the surface and bulk  states .",
    "an important point that we obtained from our calculation is the appearance of three 2d bulk states and the known surface resonances of these surfaces .",
    "the 2d bulk states appear in the electronic structure due to the breaking of the crystal translational symmetry in the ( 100 ) direction , as we have shown for ii ",
