    "the tensor model was originally considered in @xcite to generalize the matrix model , which describes the two - dimensional simplicial quantum gravity , to higher dimensional cases .",
    "while the matrix model is a successful tool to analyze the two - dimensional simplicial gravity , the tensor model has not been successful in this direction , partly because of the absence of analytical methods to solve it and of physically appropriate interpretations of its partition function .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new interpretation of the rank - three tensor model was proposed .",
    "namely , theory of a dynamical rank - three tensor may be regarded as that of dynamical fuzzy spaces .",
    "this proposal is based on the fact that a fuzzy space is described by an algebra of functions , which can be characterized by a rank - three tensor that defines multiplication , @xmath0 .",
    "this reinterpretation of the tensor model provides a new practical manner of extracting physics from the tensor model . in the original interpretation ,",
    "it is necessary to compute the tensor model non - perturbatively , since the large volume limit of spaces corresponds to the large loop - number limit of the feynman diagrams of the tensor model . on the contrary , under the new interpretation ,",
    "the semiclassical treatment of the tensor model is physically meaningful ; its classical solutions can be regarded as background fuzzy spaces , and small fluctuations around solutions as field fluctuations on fuzzy spaces .",
    "another key difference from the original proposal is that rank - three is enough as the rank of tensor to describe fuzzy spaces with arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this property drastically simplifies the structures of the tensor model , since various dimensional cases can be treated in a common framework .",
    "the rank - three tensor model has mainly been analyzed in numerical manners by the present author @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the tensor models that possess a certain gaussian type of classical solutions , it has numerically been shown that the properties of low - lying long - wavelength modes of small fluctuations around such gaussian backgrounds are in remarkable agreement with the general relativity in all the dimensional cases having been studied so far ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "namely , the general relativity was found to emerge in the tensor model as an effective long - wavelength description of the tensor model around a particular class of classical background solutions .",
    "this is also expected to be true in any other dimensions , since the framework and the procedure of analysis are common .",
    "this paper gives a summary of the results obtained so far concerning the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor model .",
    "there exist various versions of the rank - three tensor model @xcite .",
    "the simplest is the one that has a real symmetric rank - three tensor as its only dynamical variable , and has the invariance under the orthogonal group . in this paper , this simplest one is considered .",
    "the dynamical variable is a real - valued rank - three tensor @xmath2 , each index of which takes integers , @xmath3 .",
    "the number @xmath4 is the total number of linearly independent functions on a fuzzy space , or can more physically be interpreted as the number of `` points '' forming a fuzzy space .",
    "the variable @xmath2 is assumed to be totally symmetric , @xmath5 the algebra of products defined by @xmath6 is commutative but nonassociative in general .",
    "therefore the tensor model in this paper is a theory of dynamical commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy spaces .",
    "the basis of functions @xmath7 can be changed by linear transformations .",
    "a simple choice of equivalence of the basis functions is to assume that bases related by the orthogonal transformations represent equivalent fuzzy spaces .",
    "correspondingly , the tensor model must be invariant under the orthogonal transformation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an arbitrary element of the orthogonal group @xmath10 .",
    "the definition of the system is given by a partition function , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an action with the variable @xmath2 , and must be invariant under the orthogonal group transformation ( [ eq : trans ] ) . the integration measure @xmath13 must also be invariant under ( [ eq : trans ] ) , and is defined from the invariant metric in the space of @xmath2 given by @xmath14",
    "so far , the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor model has only been shown around a particular class of backgrounds in the tensor model .",
    "these backgrounds have certain gaussian forms , and the algebras defined by them represent certain simple kinds of commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy flat spaces with arbitrary dimensions @xcite . in this section , to describe such genuine gaussian backgrounds , the indices of @xmath2 are assumed to take continuous values , while they will take finite discrete values in the actual analyses of the following sections .",
    "the gaussian backgrounds have the form , @xmath15 , \\label{eq : cx}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive numerical constants , @xmath18 are @xmath19-dimensional continuous coordinates , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the algebra of functions @xmath22 defines a commutative _ nonassociative _ fuzzy @xmath19-dimensional flat space considered in @xcite . because of the translational symmetry of ( [ eq : cx ] )",
    ", it is generally more convenient to describe it in the momentum basis . by applying fourier transformation to the coordinate indices , one obtains the expression in the momentum basis because of the reality condition of the tensor in the coordinate basis , and one needs also an additional symmetric tensor @xmath23 for contracting the indices .",
    "these details are essentially important in the mode analysis of the following sections .",
    "] as @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive numerical constants .",
    "one of the motivations for considering such particular solutions is the ( partial ) computability due to the gaussian forms .",
    "another is that the fuzzy spaces are physically well - behaved , because the fuzziness is well localized and the spaces are invariant under the poincare transformation , representing fuzzy @xmath19-dimensional flat spaces .",
    "moreover , as shown in the next section , there exists a natural correspondence between the metric field in the general relativity and the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model .",
    "in fact , there exist infinitely many actions that have such gaussian backgrounds as their classical solutions .",
    "two explicit examples have been studied so far @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit forms of the actions are very complicated and unnatural .",
    "this is a serious problem , which must be investigated in future study .",
    "however , what is interesting and remarkable in these actions in common is that each of them contains all the dimensional gaussian fuzzy flat spaces as its classical solutions , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : potential ] .",
    "this means that all the dimensional spaces can be treated with one action in a unified manner .",
    "thus , for example , it is in principle possible to study transitions between spaces with distinct dimensions in the tensor model .",
    "in the physical interpretation of the tensor model , a classical solution should be regarded as a background space , and fluctuations of tensor around such a classical solution as field fluctuations on a background space .",
    "the main interest of the present study is whether such fluctuations can be identified with the general relativity or not . to check this ,",
    "the procedure carried out so far in @xcite assumes a correspondence between the tensor model around the gaussian backgrounds and the metric tensor field in the general relativity .",
    "this correspondence enables one to compute the expectations about the tensor model from the general relativity .",
    "if the expectations successfully agree with the numerical analysis of the tensor model , one may conclude that the general relativity is emergent around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model .    generalizing the gaussian backgrounds ( [ eq : cx ] ) in a coordinate invariant manner",
    ", one can derive a natural correspondence between the metric tensor field in the general relativity and the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds as @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denotes the geometric distance between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the main assumption in this correspondence is that the low - lying long - wavelength fluctuations of the tensor around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model are exhausted by the metric field in the general relativity in the manner given in ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this correspondence could be modified in higher orders of the fuzziness @xmath32 .",
    "for example , there could exist corrections such as @xmath33 in ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) .",
    "although it is certainly possible to directly use the correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) in the comparison between the tensor model and the general relativity , it is much more convenient to use a tensor with a smaller rank .",
    "let me define @xmath34 small fluctuations @xmath35 around a classical solution @xmath36 induces fluctuations of @xmath37 as @xmath38    on the other hand , if one assumes a gaussian background and puts the assumed correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) into ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) , one obtains in the lowest order @xcite @xmath39 where the momentum basis is used , and @xmath40 is the fourier transform of @xmath41 , which describes the fluctuations of the metric tensor field around a flat background .    in later sections ,",
    "the analysis of eigenvectors gives @xmath35 of each fluctuation mode in the tensor model .",
    "then one can compute @xmath42 of each mode by putting this @xmath35 and the background @xmath36 into ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) .",
    "this @xmath42 obtained from the numerical analysis of the tensor model can be compared with the fluctuation modes of the metric tensor field in the general relativity through ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) .",
    "another important fact which can be derived from ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) is that the measure which must be used in the analysis of the general relativity is uniquely determined from the measure ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) in the tensor model . by putting the correspondence ( [ eq : correspondence ] ) into ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) , one obtains the dewitt supermetric @xcite , @xmath43,\\ ] ] in the lowest order @xcite .",
    "in this section , i will study the small geometric fluctuations on @xmath19-dimensional flat tori in the general relativity to prepare for the comparison with the tensor model .",
    "the important point in the analysis is that not all of the fluctuations of the metric tensor field are the fluctuations of geometry , because of the gauge symmetry ( local translation symmetry ) in the general relativity .",
    "the relevant modes are only those which are normal to the gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the measure to be used to define this normality condition is the dewitt supermetric given in ( [ eq : supermetric ] ) , since the numerical analysis of the tensor model uses the corresponding measure ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) as shown in the following section .    for small fluctuations around a flat metric @xmath44 , the supermetric ( [ eq : supermetric ] ) is given by @xmath45.\\ ] ] on the other hand , the infinitesimal gauge transformation on a flat background",
    "is given in the momentum basis by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fourier transform of local translation vector .    at the vanishing momentum sector @xmath48 , as can be seen in ( [ eq : gaugemom ] ) , the gauge transformation is vacant , and all the components of the metric tensor are geometric degrees of freedom . by diagonalizing the supermetric ( [ eq : explicit ] ) ,",
    "the modes can be shown to be classified into the following three orthogonal classes : + ( i ) 1 conformal mode : @xmath49 .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath50 traceless diagonal modes : @xmath51 .",
    "+ ( iii ) @xmath52 off - diagonal modes .    at the nonvanishing momentum sector",
    ", one may take the momentum to be in the direction @xmath53 with obvious generalization to the other directions .",
    "then one can show that the modes normal to the gauge directions ( [ eq : gaugemom ] ) in the sense of the supermetric ( [ eq : explicit ] ) can be classified into the following three orthogonal classes : + ( i ) 1 diagonal mode : @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath57 traceless diagonal modes : @xmath58 , @xmath59 . + ( iii ) @xmath60 off - diagonal modes : @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath42 for the geometric fluctuations of each mode in the general relativity can be computed by putting these results into ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) , and can be compared with the numerical analysis of the tensor model .",
    "in this section , i will give a brief summary of the numerical analyses having been done so far on the small fluctuations around the gaussian backgrounds in the tensor model @xcite .    to unambiguously determine the spectra , the fluctuations must be normalized in a manner respecting the symmetries of the tensor model .",
    "the tensor @xmath2 is symmetric under the exchanges of the indices as in ( [ eq : csym ] ) , and the tensor model has the orthogonal group symmetry ( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "thus the independent components of fluctuations are normalized through ( [ eq : cmeasure ] ) as @xmath64\\ ,   d c_{abc}\\ , d c^{abc}=\\sum_{(abc ) } d \\tilde c_{(abc ) } \\ , d \\tilde c^{(abc)},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 denotes an order - independent set of three indices , @xmath66}\\,c_{abc}$ ] are the independent normalized components , and @xmath67 $ ] is the multiplicity defined by @xmath68=\\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ll } 1 & \\hbox{for } a = b = c,\\\\ 3 & \\hbox{for } a = b\\neq c,\\ b = c\\neq a,\\ c = a\\neq b,\\\\ 6 & \\hbox{all different}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] then the coefficient matrix for the normalized fluctuations in the quadratic order around a background @xmath69 is given by @xmath70    the numerical analysis is carried out to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ( [ eq : m ] ) , and then the results are compared with the general relativity through the procedure explained in the previous sections .",
    "the genuine gaussian backgrounds presented in section [ sec : gauss ] can not be used as a background @xmath69 , because of their infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the actual numerical analyses have been done around the backgrounds of @xmath19-dimensional fuzzy flat tori . to describe such backgrounds of fuzzy flat tori in terms of @xmath2 ,",
    "the indices are assumed to take integer momenta bounded by a cut off , and the momentum conservation , @xmath71 , is assumed on account of the translational symmetry of such flat tori .",
    "in fact , under these assumptions , one can numerically find classical solutions that resemble the genuine gaussian backgrounds @xcite .",
    "using these numerical classical solutions as backgrounds , the coefficient matrices ( [ eq : m ] ) have been analyzed for dimensions @xmath72 in @xcite , and also for @xmath1 with an approximate method explained below @xcite .",
    "the numerical analyses have shown that the spectra of the modes with long - wavelengths can roughly be classified into the following three classes .",
    "+ ( i ) the `` heavy '' modes with spectra of order 1 or larger .",
    "+ ( ii ) in @xmath73 , there exist low - lying modes with non - vanishing spectra of order much smaller than 1 .",
    "+ ( iii ) the zero modes with vanishing spectra .",
    "+ it is observed that the two classes ( i ) and ( ii ) are rather clearly separated so that they are located hierarchically .",
    "the spectra in the class ( ii ) have been shown to form trajectories of the fourth power of momenta . moreover ,",
    "the spectral patterns and the mode profiles have been shown to be in good agreement with the geometric degrees of freedom in the general relativity discussed in section [ sec : gr ] , by comparing ( [ eq : tensordk ] ) computed numerically from the tensor model and ( [ eq : metricdk ] ) from the general relativity .",
    "this shows that the general relativity is emergent around such backgrounds , and that the lowest effective actions are composed of curvature quadratic terms .    as for the class ( iii ) , by counting their numbers , these modes have been identified with the modes of the @xmath10 symmetry transformations in the tensor model spontaneously broken to the remaining symmetry @xmath74 of the torus backgrounds .",
    "therefore these zero spectra are just the gauge modes of the tensor model .",
    "the relation between these zero modes and the local gauge symmetry ( local translation symmetry ) of the general relativity has been studied in @xcite , which will be summarized in the following section .    in the approximate method used in @xcite ,",
    "the backgrounds @xmath69 in ( [ eq : m ] ) are not taken to be the classical solutions , but to be approximate ones , the gaussian backgrounds ( [ eq : cp ] ) with the modifications that the continuum @xmath75-functions are replaced with kronecker deltas , and that @xmath76 is taken in the range @xmath77 for the approximation to be good . in this approximation , it is easier to numerically analyze the cases with larger @xmath78 , and the agreement between the spectra in the class ( ii ) and the geometric degrees of freedom in the general relativity has been observed more clearly than without approximations .",
    "part of the results for @xmath79 are shown in figures [ fig : dim2l10spec ] and [ fig : dim2l10 ] . especially , figure [ fig : dim2l10 ] shows very clearly the agreement of the mode profiles between the tensor model and the general relativity .",
