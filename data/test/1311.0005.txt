    "this should be crucial to observe the supersolid state in the realistic optical lattice systems  @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the supersolid state on each layer has three - fold degeneracy for particle distributions .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ 2 ] , we introduce the bose - hubbard model for the layered optical lattice system and explain the possible particle distributions for the solid and supersolid states .",

    ", it is known that the supersolid states are realized , which are surrounded by the superfluid state in the weak coupling region and solid states with @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the strong coupling region  @xcite .",
    "note that at the particle - hole symmetric case , two supersolid states with distinct particle density are degenerate .",
    "therefore , when the system is fixed at half filling , the genuine supersolid state is not stable , but the phase separation between two supersolid states appears in the strong coupling region . when @xmath20 , the model is reduced to the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model , where no supersolid state appears  @xcite . in the paper , we study the hard - core bose - hubbard model on the layered triangular lattice to discuss how the supersolid states is realized .",

    "the other point is that the ss-@xmath28 state is always stable against the ss-@xmath29 state , in contrast to the competition between the solid states discussed above .",
