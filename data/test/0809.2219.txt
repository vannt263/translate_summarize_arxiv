    "the usual contact process @xcite is a model for nonequilibrium process composed by two subprocesses : a catalytic creation and a spontaneous annihilation . in the usual contact process , which we call single - creation contact process ,",
    "a particle is created if the site has at least one neighbor site occupied .",
    "many generalizations @xcite can be made by taking into account the basic mechanisms contained in the single - creation model . in the pair - creation contact process , for instance , at least two neighbor sites occupied are necessary to create a new particle . in the triplet - creation model one should have at least three sites occupied .",
    "all these variants of the contact process exhibit a continuous phase transition between an absorbing state and an active state that belongs to the direct percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "diffusive models are defined by permitting the diffusion of particles in addition to the catalytic creation and spontaneous annihilation .",
    "a diffusion process is done by moving a particle to an empty nearest neighbor site .",
    "the introduction of diffusion does not destroy the transition from an active state to an absorbing state giving rise to a transition line that separates the two phases .",
    "jensen and dickman @xcite have shown that for the single - creation diffusive contact process this line is always second order for any diffusion rate and belongs to the dp universality class , i. e. , the addition of the diffusion does not change the universality class nor the nature of transition .",
    "for the pair - creation the numerical results by dickman and tom @xcite show that the transition is continuous for low diffusion and they argue that there is no change in the nature of the transition for high diffusion . for the triplet - creation contact process , dickman and tom @xcite have shown that the transition becomes a first order for high enough diffusion .    in the present work ,",
    "we study conservative versions of the models mentioned above .",
    "a conservative version of a model for nonequilibrium process was introduced by ziff and brozilow @xcite , who used a constant - density ensemble to study the zgb model .",
    "a conservative version of directed percolation was used by brker and grassberger @xcite .",
    "the conservative contact process was introduced by tom and de oliveira @xcite who have shown its equivalence in the thermodynamic limit to the ordinary contact process and how to calculate the rates from averages over the constant - density ensemble .",
    "the equivalence between this ensemble and the constant - rate ensemble was later proved by hilhorst and wijland @xcite .    in the conservative versions of contact",
    "processes @xcite , an empty site becomes occupied in a way similar to the catalytic creation .",
    "but instead of creating a new particle , like in the ordinary contact processes , a randomly chosen particle of the system leaves its place and jumps into the empty site .",
    "thus , both the creation and annihilation processes are replaced with a jumping process . however",
    ", this is not an unrestricted jumping because particles are not allowed to jump to a vacant site surrounded by empty sites .",
    "it is necessary to have a neighborhood ( a set of one , two , or three sites , depending on the model ) of sites occupied .",
    "one advantage of using the conservative versions is that they allow us to study the model without the danger of falling down into the absorbing state .",
    "the conservation of particles permits us to perform numerical simulations that avoid the accidental fall into the absorbing state .",
    "although they do not have absorbing states , they are equivalent , in the thermodynamic limit , to the ordinary models .",
    "the conservative and ordinary models are versions of the same model in distinct ensembles @xcite ; the first models belonging to the constant - particle ensemble , the second models belonging to the constant - rate ensemble .",
    "another advantage is related to the expected existence of first order transition . in the ordinary models ,",
    "a very small change in the annihilation rate ( the control parameter ) , near the transition , causes a great change in the density . in the conservative models , because of the fact that the particle number is a conserved quantity ( and therefore , works as the control parameter ) , this problem does not occur .",
    "this advantage has been used by ziff and brosilow @xcite in their study first order transition in the zgb model .",
    "in the construction of conserved models we have to be concerned only with the reaction process since the diffusion process already conserves the particle number . the necessary condition to set up an equivalent conserved version of an arbitrary ordinary reaction - diffusion process in a lattice",
    "is that the reaction process be a sum of a creation subprocess and an annihilation subprocess @xcite .",
    "this is always possible do realize because these two subprocesses are mutually excludent . if a site of the lattice is empty only creation is possible ; if it is occupied , only annihilation is possible .",
    "therefore , the transition rate @xmath0 related the creation - annihilation of a particle at site @xmath1 can always be written in the form @xmath2 where the first term is related to the creation of a particle at site @xmath1 and the second to annihilation of a particle at site @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 vanishes if there is already a particle at site @xmath1 and @xmath4 vanishes if site @xmath1 is empty .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the actual parameters of the ordinary model which we call amplitudes of the creation and annihilation rates , respectively .    the conserved version is set up by replacing both the creation and annihilation subprocesses by a particle jump process @xmath7 with rate @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of sites of the lattice .",
    "one can prove @xcite that a two site process defined by this transition rate is equivalent in the thermodynamic limit to the ordinary process . to see how this come about let us look at the total rate @xmath10 in which particles jump to site @xmath11 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the sum @xmath12 approaches , by the law of large numbers , the average @xmath13 so that @xmath14 . by an analogous argument the total rate in which particles leave the site @xmath1 is @xmath15 .",
    "the averages @xmath13 and @xmath16 act then as the amplitudes of creation and annihilation rates , respectively , what allows us to write down the following relation @xcite @xmath17 between the amplitude rates of the constant - rate ensemble and averages determined in the constant - particle ensemble .    for the model we study here particles",
    "are spontaneous annihilated do that @xmath4 is 1 if site @xmath1 is occupied and 0 if it is empty .",
    "therefore @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of particles .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is 0 if site @xmath11 is occupied . since creation is catalytic , this quantity depends also on the neighborhood of site @xmath11 . for the single - creation model it equals half the number of nearest neighbor",
    "occupied sites . for the pair - creation model",
    "it equals half the number of pairs of nearest neighbor occupied sites . for the triplet - creation model it equals half the number of triplets of nearest neighbor",
    "occupied sites .",
    "it is convenient do define an active site as the site for which @xmath20 is nonzero .",
    "the number of active sites @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 we also define a quantity @xmath23 as being the right - hand side of equation ( [ tl ] ) so that , for the models studied here , @xmath24 where the averages are taken in the constant - particle ensemble . usually one defines the ordinary reaction process so that the rate amplitudes are @xmath25 and @xmath26 . therefore , according to relation ( [ tl ] ) , @xmath23 coincides with the parameter @xmath27 of the ordinary model as long as the average density of particles of the ordinary models equals the density of particle @xmath28 in the conserved models .",
    "the rules of the reaction - diffusion processes we used are such that the diffusion occurs with probability @xmath29 and the jump process with probability @xmath30 .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 and the diffusion rate @xmath31 are related by @xmath32",
    "the average number of active sites per site of the lattice equals the probabilities @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the single - creation , pair - creation and triplet - creation models , respectively .",
    "since the number o particles per site is the probability @xmath36 it follows that @xmath23 is given , respectively , by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , for the three models . in the limit of infinite diffusion rate the particles",
    "will be uncorrelated so that @xmath40 , etc .",
    "taking into account that @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we get the following exact results for the active state , valid for @xmath43 , @xmath44 for the single - creation model , @xmath45 for the pair - creation model , and @xmath46 for the triplet - creation model .",
    "these results give a continuous transition for the single - creation model .",
    "for the pair - creation and triplet - creation models , on the other hand , they give a discontinuous transition since @xmath47 does not vanishes continuously as one increases @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 has a maximum at a nonzero value @xmath48 of the density which is @xmath49 for the pair - creation model and @xmath50 for the triplet - creation .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath23 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "since there is no free energy from which we could decide at what point the jump in the density occurs one is tempted to use the maximum value of @xmath23 ( spinodal point ) .",
    "however , as we will see , our numerical results do not support this point of view . according to the numerical results ,",
    "the discontinuity occurs at a smaller value of @xmath23 .    for the single creation the diffusion does not change the nature of the transition . even at infinite diffusion rate",
    "the transition is continuous as the exact result ( [ sc ] ) shows .",
    "the critical line on the diagram @xmath29 versus @xmath23 can be obtained by a mean - field approximation . by using a two - site mean - field approximation",
    "we get a relation between @xmath47 and @xmath23 which shows a continuous transition for all values of @xmath29 and which recovers the exact result ( [ sc ] ) when @xmath43 .",
    "the critical line obtained from this approximation is given by @xmath53 showing that @xmath54 as @xmath55 in accordance with the exact result ( [ sc ] ) and , as we will see , with numerical simulations .    the exact results ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) for the pair - creation and triplet - creation models can not be used to infer that the transition will remain discontinuous for finite diffusion rate even if the rate is large .",
    "an indication that the transition is continuous at low diffusion and discontinuous for sufficiently large diffusion , giving rise to a tricritical point , comes from mean - field approximations which can be done at several levels @xcite . at the level of three sites",
    "the mean - field approximation locates the tricritical point of the pair - creation model at @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the triplet - creation model",
    "it is necessary to use a higher order of approximation . at the level of four sites",
    "the tricritical point occurs at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "although both results are in qualitative agreement with our numerical simulations they are very low when compared with the figures coming from the numerical simulations .",
    "we have simulated the conservative diffusive contact process in a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the actual simulation is performed as follows . at each time",
    "step a particle is selected at random , say a particle at site @xmath1 , and one of its neighboring sites is chosen randomly , say site @xmath11 .",
    "if this neighboring site is empty then we decide which process to perform : the diffusion of particles , occurring with probability @xmath59 , or the creation - annihilation process , occurring with probability @xmath60 .",
    "if the diffusion process is chosen then the particle at @xmath1 hops to the neighboring site @xmath11 .",
    "if the creation - annihilation process is chosen then any another particle of the system , including the one at site @xmath1 , is chosen randomly and placed at site @xmath11 . in the case of the pair - creation or triplet - creation models",
    ", however , this only happens if the chosen particle @xmath1 has at least one or two nearest neighbor occupied sites , respectively .",
    "the relation between the probability @xmath59 we use in the simulation and the actual probability of diffusion @xmath29 is @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this is so because we are choosing a particle from a list of occupied sites and then choosing with equal probability one of the neighboring sites to place the particle .                       as function of the particle density @xmath47 for several values of @xmath9 in the supercritical regime for @xmath62 for the pair - creation model . ]",
    "the simulation was performed using lattices with @xmath9 sites and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the averages of the appropriates quantities were obtained from a number of monte carlo steps ranging from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , after discarding a sufficient number of steps to reach the stationary state . in figs .",
    "[ supsingle ] , [ suppair ] and [ suptriplet ] , we show the particle density @xmath65 as a function of @xmath23 , calculated by using formula ( [ 5 ] ) , for several values of the hopping probability @xmath29 .",

    "as expected , for high diffusion rate the curves approach the exact behaviors given by equations ( [ sc ] ) , ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) .    for the diffusive single - creation contact process , the transition is found to be continuous for all values of @xmath29 .",
    "increasing the diffusion probability @xmath29 the critical value of @xmath23 increases towards the value @xmath67 when @xmath68 as expected .",
    "for the diffusive pair - creation and triplet - creation models the phase transition is continuous for low diffusion becoming discontinuous for high enough diffusion .",

    "[ suppair ] and [ suptriplet ] seems to show that this is indeed the case .    to compare the behaviors corresponding to the second and first order transitions , we simulated the pair - creation model at @xmath71 and @xmath62 for various values of the system size @xmath9 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",

    "indeed for the single - creation model and for the pair and triplet up to a certain value of @xmath29 we found a fractal dimension @xmath88 which is the expected value for a system in the dp universality class .",
    "however , for the pair and triplet creation and for sufficient large values of @xmath29 , the fractal dimension becomes the euclidean dimension @xmath89 reflecting the formation of a compact cluster whose size @xmath84 increases linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "the changing of behavior occurs at @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the pair - creation model and @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the triplet - creation model .",

    "the numerical results obtained by dickman and tom @xcite show that the transition is continuous for @xmath98 which is consistent with our results .",
    "however , they argue that the transition should remain continuous for any finite diffusion .    we argue that the formation of a compact cluster ( @xmath99 ) is a signature of a first order transition .",
    "first of all , the compact cluster has a nonzero density because @xmath100 does not vanish in the limit @xmath76 and should therefore be identified with the active phase . since the lattice is infinite the active phase is in coexistence with the frozen state ( no particles ) .",
    "this behavior is very different from that corresponding to a continuous transition . in this case , the fractal dimension is less than one which can not be identified with the active phase since the density @xmath101 when @xmath102",
    ".    when the cluster is a compact one , the ratio @xmath103 gives , in the limit @xmath104 , the density @xmath48 of the active phase in coexistence with the frozen phase .",

    "using the numerical values , we get @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the pair - creation model , and the triplet - creation model , respectively . as stated before , these values are distinct from the spinodal values coming from the exact solutions ( [ pc ] ) and ( [ tc ] ) .",
    "we remark , on the other hand , that the value of @xmath48 that we have obtained for the triplet - creation model agrees with the value @xmath109 obtained by dickman and tom @xcite for the active coexistence phase at @xmath110 .",
    "the effect of diffusion in nonequilibrium systems has been studied here for the case of three conservative contact processes . for the single - creation contact process",
    ", the diffusion does not change the nature of the phase transition , being continuous for any diffusion rate .",
    "this is expected since the usual contact process has already an intrinsic diffusion .",
    "indeed , consider the following sequence of transitions @xmath111 starting with an isolated particle .",
    "the net result is a hopping of the isolated particle to a neighboring site , or effectively a diffusion .",
    "the sequence shown is a possible sequence of states for the single - creation which is carried out by a creation followed by a annihilation .",
    "this sequence , on the other hand , is not possible for the other two models .    for the pair - creation and and triplet - creation models",
    "the transition is continuous for low diffusion and becomes discontinuous for high enough diffusion .",
    "the present approach in which the number of particles is conserved is appropriate to study first order transition because it is possible to distinguish this transition from a continuous one by measuring the fractal dimension of the fractal cluster occurring at the critical point .",
    "if the fractal dimension is smaller than the dimension of the lattice the transition is continuous . when the cluster becomes compact , and the fractal dimension equals the lattice dimension ,",
    "the transition becomes first order and , in addition , the density of particles turns out to be the density of the active phase in coexistence with the frozen phase .",
