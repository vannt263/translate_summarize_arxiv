    "quantum walks ( qws ) constitute the quantum analogue of classical random walks @xcite and also the quantum version of cellular automata @xcite .",
    "they have been intensively investigated , especially in connection with quantum information science @xcite . as in the classical case ,",
    "qws have been proposed as elements to design quantum algorithms @xcite and more recently it has been shown that they can be used as a universal model for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we have been investigating @xcite the asymptotic behavior of the qw on a line , focusing on the probability distribution of chirality independently of position .",
    "we showed that this distribution has a stationary long - time limit that depends on the initial conditions and that it is possible to define a thermodynamic equilibrium between the degrees of freedom of position and chirality @xcite .",
    "for this equilibrium state we have introduced a temperature concept for an unitary closed system .    on the other hand , the fundamental lower bound of the thermodynamic energy cost of information processing has been a topic of active research @xcite . on average ,",
    "the minimum amount of work required to erase @xmath0 bit of information from a memory is @xmath1 @xcite . in the last decades developments in nano - science",
    "have enabled the direct measurement of such minuscule amounts of work for small non - equilibrium thermodynamic systems @xcite . at the same time",
    "recent advances in technology have opened the possibility of building useful quantum computing devices @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems essential to identify bounds on the thermodynamic energy cost of information processing @xcite for these new quantum devices .    in the present paper",
    "we study the relationship between the qw thermodynamics and information processing .",
    "in particular , we show that it is possible to apply the thermodynamic laws to the qw dynamics after a measurement process .",
    "we obtain the upper and lower bound for the asymptotic change of the entanglement entropy .",
    "our result may be thought as complementary to the results presented in refs . @xcite where the information content and thermodynamic variables are treated on an equal footing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the usual qw on a line is presented , in the third section the system dynamics with measurement is developed , in the fourth section the entropy change between the asymptotic stationary states is studied , in the fifth section the laws of thermodynamics are applied to the same process .",
    "finally , in the last section we draw some conclusions .",
    "the composite hilbert space of the qw is the tensor product @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hilbert space associated to the motion on a line and @xmath4 is the chirality ( or coin ) hilbert space . in this composite space",
    "the walker moves , at discrete time steps @xmath5 , along a one - dimensional lattice of sites @xmath6 .",
    "the direction of motion depends on the chirality states , either right or left .",
    "the wave vector can be expressed as the spinor @xmath7where the upper ( lower ) component is associated to the left ( right ) chirality .",
    "the qw is ruled by a unitary map whose standard form is romanelli09,alejo2,alejo1,alejo4 @xmath8where @xmath9 $ ] is a parameter defining the bias of the coin toss .",
    "here we take @xmath10 for an unbiased or hadamard coin .",
    "the probability of finding the walker at @xmath11 is @xmath12the global left and right chirality probabilities are defined as @xmath13with @xmath14 and the interference term is defined as @xmath15 in the generic case @xmath16 together with @xmath17 and @xmath18 are time depend functions that have long - time limiting values @xcite which are determined both by the initial conditions and by the map in eq.([mapa ] ) .",
    "the relation between the initial condition and the asymptotic distributions has also been recently explored in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us call the mentioned limits as @xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the real and imaginary part of @xmath22 .",
    "the following relations are verified @xcite between @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 it is important to emphasize that the asymptotic behavior in eq.([asym ] ) is determined by the interference term @xmath25 that only depends on the initial conditions .    the initial condition the walker localized at the origin with arbitrary chirality will play a central roll in our analytic treatment .",
    "then @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] define a point on the unit bloch sphere .",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath30 , \\label{q0entengl}\\ ] ] and also @xmath23 and @xmath24 using eq.([estacio ] ) .",
    "we consider first the qw evolution starting from the initial condition given by eq.([psi0 ] ) and determine the asymptotic density matrix .",
    "the quantum density matrix is defined as @xmath31substituting eq.([spinor ] ) into eq.([density ] ) we have @xmath32where @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend also on the initial conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    note",
    "that when @xmath37 the limits of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not defined because , in general , they have an oscillatory asymptotic behavior @xcite ; however the limits given by eq.([asym ] ) are always well defined . in the following we call @xmath38 and @xmath39 to the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , evaluated at times large enough so that the asymptotic limit , eq.([asym ] ) , is essentially attained .",
    "let us define the asymptotic reduced density matrix as @xmath40 for @xmath37 .",
    "this matrix takes the following shape @xmath41      when the asymptotic density matrix is attained a measurement of position and chirality is performed .",
    "then the wave function collapses into one element of the set of eigenvectors of the measurement operator @xmath42 , where @xmath43after the measurement , the density matrix has the form @xmath44where @xmath45 .",
    "eq.([density3 ] ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath46equation ( [ density3 ] ) sets a new initial condition and we will study the asymptotic evolution of the new density matrix . essentially we must study the evolution of the densities @xmath47 . we know , from the qw dynamics , that if the initial condition is given by eq.([psi0 ] ) then the density matrix is given by eq.([density1 ] ) .",
    "we can use these equations as a recipe to obtain the unknown evolutions , that is , when we choose a particular initial condition given by @xmath48 we have @xmath49where @xmath50 is the qw evolution operator and @xmath51 and @xmath52 verify the map eq.([mapa ] ) , that is @xmath51 and @xmath53 are equivalent to some functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the expressions @xmath51 and @xmath52 show explicitly their dependence both on the chirality , @xmath56 , as with , @xmath57 , the walker s initial position on a line .",
    "therefore , the new quantum density matrix is @xmath58 where @xmath59 , \\label{density6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath60 , \\label{density9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61 , \\label{density7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath62    we again point out that the probability density has an asymptotic limit for long times .",
    "we now call the values of @xmath63 and @xmath53 evaluated at such times @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we want to calculate in this limit the reduced density matrix , namely @xmath66 , @xmath37 . using the density matrix given by eq.([density30 ] ) , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 according to eqs.([chirality ] ) , ( [ qdet ] ) and ( [ asym ] ) , we define @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 to obtain the explicit shape of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we can use again eqs.([estacio ] , [ q0entengl ] ) where the initial condition is , the walker localized at the position @xmath57 with chirality @xmath77 respectively , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 note that the principal difference between eq.([psi0 ] ) and eq.([psi1 ] ) is in the walker s initial position , that is , in eq.([psi1 ] ) @xmath57 is arbitrary and in eq.([psi0 ] ) @xmath79 .",
    "however , even with this difference , eq.([qdet ] ) continues to be valid for the calculation of @xmath76 because the original map , eq.([mapa ] ) , is invariant under translations and therefore this magnitude is independent of @xmath57 . for the same reason eqs.([ty66 ] ) and ( [ ty77 ] ) are independent of @xmath57 , and then eq . ( [ density300 ] ) reduces to @xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are given by eqs.([estacio ] , [ q0entengl ] ) .",
    "moreover , using the initial condition of eq.([psi1 ] ) in eq.([q0entengl ] ) and eq.([estacio ] ) it is straightforward to obtain @xmath85 note that @xmath86 and @xmath87 , eqs.([rhol ] , [ rhor ] ) , are the asymptotic densities that correspond to initial conditions associated with the eigenvalues @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "therefore , eq.([redu2 ] ) has a natural interpretation , after the measurement the asymptotic reduced density matrix is the weighted average of the two densities associated with the two possible values of the chirality .",
    "the unitary evolution of the qw generates entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom which can be quantified through the associated von neumann entropy .",
    "this entropy of entanglement is defined by the reduced density operator @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes a proportionality constant , the boltzmann constant .    for a pure state",
    "the minimum entropy @xmath92 is attained .",
    "the maximum entropy ( or minimum purity ) is to be found for the broadest possible probability distribution , the equipartition over all pure states",
    ".    equation ( [ dos ] ) can be expressed as a function of the eigenvalues of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xmath96    using eqs.([densityc ] ) , ( [ redu2 ] ) , ( [ rhol ] ) and ( [ rhor ] ) we can calculate the entanglement entropies for the four stationary densities introduced in the previous section .",
    "the eigenvalues of the density operator @xmath97 are @xmath98 and those of @xmath99 are @xmath100 the operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 have the same eigenvalues and they are @xmath101 therefore , the four entanglement entropies are expressed as @xmath102    we now show that @xmath103 has a non obvious upper bound , using a known theorem that plays an important role in many applications of quantum information theory @xcite . applying the mentioned theorem to the entropy of the mixture of quantum states given by eq .",
    "( [ redu2 ] ) , the following upper bound is obtained @xmath104 the entropies @xmath105 , @xmath103 and the expression @xmath106 only depend on the interference term @xmath25 .",
    "note that from eq.([q0entengl ] ) we have @xmath107 , then we approximate the @xmath108 functions in eqs .",
    "( [ ss1 ] ) , ( [ ss2 ] ) and ( [ teorema2a ] ) , using the first few terms of their taylor series to calculate the entropy change between the two asymptotic stationary states , @xmath109 the distance between @xmath103 and its upper bound can be approximated by @xmath110 combining eqs.([teorema2a ] ) , ( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ deltas2 ] ) , it is easy to obtain the following upper bound for @xmath111 @xmath112    when @xmath25 vanishes , eq.([deltas ] ) shows that @xmath113 and these entropies take their maximum value .",
    "moreover in this case ( @xmath114 ) the qw dynamics can be described as a classical markovian process @xcite ; it has a markovian behavior both before and after the measurement .",
    "the initial conditions for this behavior are @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "when @xmath117 , the measurement process essentially determines an entropy increase for the system , @xmath118 .     for the case @xmath119",
    ". in thick line the entropy change given by eq.([deltas ] ) . in dashed line",
    "the entropy change given by eq.([deltas2 ] ) . ]    the entropy change for a real @xmath22 is depicted in fig .",
    "the calculation was made using the entropy definition eqs .",
    "( [ ss1 ] , [ ss2 ] , [ ss3 ] , [ ss ] ) , therefore the curves show that the lineal approximation proposed in eqs .",
    "( [ deltas ] , [ deltas2 ] ) is excellent .",
    "in previous works @xcite , we studied the behavior of the chirality distribution and we introduced the temperature concept for an unitary closed system .",
    "in this theory one considers the system associated with the chirality degrees of freedom and described by @xmath120 , interacting through its entanglement with the position degrees of freedom , the lattice , as equivalent to the thermal contact with a bath .",
    "therefore , in equilibrium @xmath121=0 ,   \\label{scho2}\\ ] ] should be satisfied , where @xmath122 is the interaction hamiltonian between the chirality and the lattice . in the qw case",
    ", the explicit shape of @xmath122 is unknown for us , however we know that the eigenvalues of @xmath122 are independent of the initial condition of the wave function , they only depend on the unitary evolution .",
    "in contrast , the eigenvalues @xmath123 depend on the initial conditions and the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath122 .",
    "we call @xmath124 the set of eigenfunctions common to the density matrix and the hamiltonian , then in this basis the operators @xmath93 and @xmath125 are both diagonal . moreover , since only the relative difference between energy eigenvalues has physical significance , we denote this set of eigenvalues by @xmath126 ; they may be interpreted as the possible values of the entanglement energy .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the fact that @xmath127 is the probability that the system is in the eigenstate @xmath128 .",
    "the precise dependence between @xmath123 and @xmath129 is determined by the type of ensemble we construct .",
    "we propose that our equilibrium state corresponds to a quantum canonical ensemble . to this end",
    "we set @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the partition function of the system , that is @xmath132 and the parameter @xmath133 can be put into correspondence with an entanglement temperature @xmath134 the entanglement temperature , eq.([tem ] ) , can take any finite , infinite , positive or negative value .",
    "note that when the energy of a system is bounded from above there is no compelling reason to exclude the possibility of negative temperatures .    in this statistical mechanic frame",
    "it is possible to define the internal energy of entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom @xmath135 the variations of temperature , @xmath136 and internal energy , @xmath137 between the two asymptotic states can be calculatedas as functions of the interference term @xmath22 . using eqs.([lam0 ] ) and ( [ lam22 ] ) together with eqs.([tem ] ) and ( [ uu2 ] ) we have @xmath138 @xmath139 equation ( [ tem2 ] ) shows that @xmath140 is only possible if @xmath141 , and this implies that @xmath142 , then the two asymptotic states have the same temperature and in this sense we can to think of an `` isothermal process '' .",
    "as the temperature concept makes sense only in an equilibrium state it is clear that between these two asymptotic states the temperature is not defined .",
    "additionally eq.([uu ] ) implies that @xmath143 and vanishes when @xmath142 .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics is now applied to the evolution between the two asymptotic stationary states expressed as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the qw heat absorbed during the measurement process and @xmath146 is the work made over the qw .",
    "thermodynamic work is defined to be measurable solely from the knowledge of external constraint variables . in this system",
    "the only parametric dependence of the thermodynamical functions is with the temperature , because the energy levels @xmath147 are maintained constant , then @xmath148 .",
    "therefore the first law is reduced to @xmath149 from eq.([prin2 ] ) we conclude that : i ) the change of internal energy is due to the heat delivered during the measurement process .",
    "ii ) the heat behaves as a state function , then the real process can be substituted by a quasi - static process between the two asymptotic stationary states ( characterized by their temperatures ) , where it is possible to defined the infinitesimal @xmath150 .",
    "scale ) as a function of the dimensionless interference term @xmath151 .",
    "the medium ( green ) surface is the change of entropy given by eq.([deltas ] ) .",
    "the upper and lower ( red ) surfaces are the upper and lower bounds @xmath152 and @xmath153 given by eq.([deltas3 ] ) and eq.([prin33 ] ) respectively . ]    in general , for an irreversible process , the second law of thermodynamics is expressed as @xmath154 the question may be posed if this law is satisfied for the entropy , temperature and heat that were defined in our system .",
    "the answer to this question must be positive because the starting point of our theory has been to postulate the canonical distribution for the reduced density matrix therefore the thermodynamic laws are obeyed .",
    "we do not know the temperature dependence with the absorbed heat in order to compute the integral in eq.([prin3 ] ) .",
    "however we can obtain a bound for this integral in order to verify the second law for the entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom .",
    "we have @xmath155 , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the temperatures of the stationary states before and after the measurement",
    ". then @xmath158 therefore , using eq.([prin2 ] ) we can propose the second law for the entanglement entropy @xmath159 the lower bound @xmath153 can be expressed as a function of the interference term @xmath22 , eqs.([lam0 ] , [ lam22 ] , [ tem ] , [ uu ] , [ prin2 ] , [ prin4 ] ) @xmath160 . \\label{prin33}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show the entropy change together with its bounds .",
    "the entropy calculations were made using the definitions eqs .",
    "( [ ss1 ] , [ ss2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the second law of thermodynamic in the form of eq.([prin4 ] ) is satisfied by the theory developed in the present paper and additionally we show the correctness of the upper bound given by equation eq.([deltas3 ] ) .",
    "in previous works we developed the thermodynamics associated with the entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom . here",
    "we consider a special dynamics of a qw on a line .",
    "initially , the walker localized at the origin with arbitrary chirality , evolves to an asymptotic stationary state , then a measurement is performed and the state resulting from this measurement is the initial condition for a second qw dynamics to achieve a second asymptotic stationary state .",
    "we have studied the first and second laws of thermodynamics in the process between the two stationary states mentioned before .",
    "these asymptotic stationary states only depends on the initial conditions through the interference term of the initial wave function .",
    "we show that the change of entropy has upper and lower bounds and they are obtained analytically as a function of the initial conditions .",
    "we have also shown that the measurement process changes the energy and this change is associated to a heat transference process .",
