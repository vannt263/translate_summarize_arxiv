    "<S> extremely large effects were reported for double jumps between different intensity periods in experiments with two and three ba@xmath0 ions for distances in the range of about ten wave lengths of the strong transition while no effects were observed for hg@xmath0 at 15 wave lengths . in this theoretical paper </S>",
    "<S> we study this question for configurations with three and four levels which model those of hg@xmath0 and ba@xmath0 , respectively . for two systems in the hg@xmath0 configuration </S>",
    "<S> we find cooperative effects of up to 30% for distances around one or two wave lengths , about 5% around ten wave lengths , and , for larger distances in agreement with experiments , practically none . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar for two v systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , for two four - level configurations , which model two ba@xmath0 ions , cooperative effects are practically absent , and this latter result is at odds with the experimental findings for ba@xmath0 . </S>"
