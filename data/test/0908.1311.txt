    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the gluon field were first proposed by nambu in 1966 @xcite just after the introduction of color degrees of freedom @xcite , and qcd has been established as the fundamental gauge theory of the strong interaction , through the explanation of asymptotic freedom @xcite , the success of perturbative qcd for high - energy phenomena based on the parton model @xcite , and lattice qcd calculations @xcite . in spite of many successes of qcd , there are still unsolved problems in the low - energy region of qcd , owing to its strong - coupling nature .",
    "indeed , the mechanism of color confinement is regarded as one of the most difficult important problems in theoretical physics @xcite , and spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite is also a difficult issue in describing it quantitatively directly from qcd @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties of qcd lies on the large gap between the fundamental fields ( quarks and gluons ) and the observable particles ( hadrons ) .",
    "in fact , quarks and gluons , which are the building blocks of qcd , have no physical asymptotic states , as a result of color confinement or the gauge invariance .",
    "this is in contrast to the ordinary perturbation theory , where all the observable phenomena can be directly described with the fundamental fields appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , the field - theoretical description of the confined particles is an interesting but unsolved difficult subject . in general ,",
    "the green function is one of the most basic quantities to describe the motions and the interactions of particles @xcite , but most green s functions of quarks and gluons are still unknown in the nonperturbative description .    as for the essence of nonperturbative qcd ,",
    "the central issue is gluon dynamics rather than quarks @xcite .",
    "in fact , the strong gluon interaction makes the qcd vacuum highly nontrivial , and color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are realized even at the quenched level @xcite .",
    "then , the analysis of gluon properties is the key point to clarify the nonperturbative aspects of qcd . in particular ,",
    "the gluon propagator , _",
    "i.e. _ , the two - point green function is one of the most basic quantities in qcd , and has been investigated with much interest in various gauges , such as the landau gauge @xcite , the coulomb gauge @xcite , and the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite , in the context of various aspects of qcd .",
    "for example , an infrared - vanishing gluon propagator @xcite is proposed from the mathematical analysis of the gribov horizon @xcite , and the infrared singularity of the gluon propagator has been investigated in terms of color confinement @xcite , and also from the viewpoint of renormalon cancellation @xcite .",
    "dynamical gluon - mass generation @xcite is also an important subject related to the infrared gluon propagation . in spite of massless perturbative gluons ,",
    "the gluon field is conjectured to acquire a large effective mass as the self - energy through the self - interaction of gluons in a nonperturbative manner . for , the glueball states ,",
    "color - singlet bound states of gluons , are considered to be fairly massive _ e.g. _ , about 1.5gev for the lowest @xmath19 and about 2gev for the lowest @xmath20 , as indicated in lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "so far , a large effective gluon mass estimated about @xmath21gev has been proposed in various context of qcd physics : analytical framework based on qcd @xcite , lattice qcd calculations @xcite , pomeron physics @xcite , glueball phenomenology @xcite , and heavy - quark phenomenology @xcite .",
    "since the color @xmath22 symmetry is unbroken in qcd , the effective - mass generation of gluons is quite different from the higgs mechanism , which is a standard mass generation in quantum field theories . in the electro - weak unified theory , the weak bosons , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "obtain quite a large mass of about 100gev , as a result of the higgs mechanism , _",
    "i.e. _ , spontaneous breaking of the @xmath25 gauge symmetry .",
    "however , the gluon mass generation is not a result of spontaneous gauge - symmetry breaking , but stems from much more complicated nonperturbative dynamics of gluons , and generally depends on the gauge choice .",
    "the nonperturbative effects originate from the strong - coupling infrared region of qcd .",
    "actually , a recent lattice qcd study clarifies that the relevant energy scale for confinement is the infrared gluon component below 1.5gev @xcite : the string tension is almost unchanged even by cutting off high - momentum gluons above 1.5gev . reflecting the asymptotic freedom or the running coupling @xmath26 , qcd exhibits various different features according to the energy scale",
    "here , we roughly classify three scale regions of qcd as  ultraviolet ( uv ) \" ,  infrared ( ir)/intermediate ( i m ) \" , and  deep - infrared ( deep - ir ) \" regions , in terms of the length @xmath27 .",
    "* we define the uv region as @xmath28 0.1fm , which corresponds to the high - energy region more than a few gev s . in this region ,",
    "perturbative qcd is approximately applicable to the reaction process , and the inter - quark potential is almost coulomb - like @xcite .",
    "* we define the ir / im region as 0.1fm @xmath29 1fm , which ranges from a few hundred mev to a few gev in energy . in this region ,",
    "the system is described by quark - gluon degrees of freedom in a nonperturbative way , which is usually substituted with some effective models @xcite .",
    "* we define the deep - ir region as @xmath30 1fm , which is low - energy below @xmath31 0.2gev . in this region ,",
    "the perturbative running coupling @xmath26 diverges , and the confinement effect is extremely large , so that quark - gluon degrees freedom are hidden and the system is described by hadrons .",
    "so far , the gluon propagator has been studied mainly in the landau gauge both in analytic framework @xcite and in lattice qcd @xcite . in the uv region",
    ", the gluon propagator takes a massless perturbative form , @xmath32 , apart from the tensor factor . in the ir / im and the deep - ir regions , the perturbative approach breaks down , and we need a nonperturbative approach such as lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "basic important ideas were proposed and investigated in the pioneering early - time lattice studies @xcite , and recent lattice studies @xcite followed them and presented high - precision data with the main interests in the deep - ir behavior by using huge - volume lattices @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the functional form of the gluon propagator is unclear still now .    in this paper",
    ", we study the functional form of the gluon propagator in the landau gauge in su(3 ) lattice qcd monte carlo calculations , especially for _ the ir / im region _ of @xmath33fm , which is considered to be relevant for the quark - hadron physics @xcite , and also aim to describe nonperturbative gluon properties , based on the obtained function form of the gluon propagator .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii , we give the formalism of the landau gauge fixing and the gluon propagator both in continuum and in lattice qcd . in sec.iii , we show the lattice qcd result of the gluon propagator in the landau gauge both in the coordinate space and in the momentum space . in sec.iv",
    ", we estimate the effective gluon mass from the gluon propagator and the effective - mass plot in lattice qcd .",
    "in sec.v , we investigate the functional form of the gluon propagator in the landau gauge , by analyzing the lattice qcd data .",
    "we show that the landau - gauge gluon propagator is well described with the yukawa - type function in the ir / im region . in sec.vi , as the applications of the yukawa - type gluon propagator , we derive analytic expressions for the zero - spatial - momentum propagator , the effective mass , and the spectral function of the gluon field .",
    "section vii is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we review the formalism of the landau gauge fixing and the gluon propagator in the euclidean space - time .",
    "the landau gauge is one of the most popular gauges in qcd . as a remarkable feature",
    ", the landau gauge keeps lorentz covariance and global @xmath22 symmetry . owing to these symmetries and the transverse property ,",
    "the color and lorentz structure of the gluon propagator is uniquely determined .    in the euclidean space - time formalism such as lattice qcd",
    ", the landau gauge is usually defined so as to minimize the gauge - field fluctuation .",
    "we then expect that only the minimal fluctuation of the gluon field survives in the landau gauge , and the physical essence of gluon properties can be investigated without suffering from large stochastic fluctuations of gauge degrees of freedom .      to begin with , let us consider the landau gauge fixing and its physical meaning in euclidean qcd . in the su@xmath34 continuum qcd , the gluon field is expressed as @xmath35 with the generator @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the landau gauge is usually defined by the local condition on the gauge field as @xmath38 in euclidean qcd , the landau gauge has a global definition to minimize the global quantity , @xmath39 by the gauge transformation .",
    "this global definition is more strict , and the local condition ( [ eq : locallandau ] ) is derived from the minimization of @xmath40 .",
    "the global quantity @xmath40 can be regarded as the total amount of the gauge - field fluctuation in the euclidean space - time . in the global definition ,",
    "the landau gauge has a clear physical interpretation that it maximally suppresses the artificial gauge - field fluctuation relating to the gauge degrees of freedom .    in lattice qcd",
    ", the theory is formulated on the discretized space - time @xcite .",
    "the qcd action is constructed from the link - variable @xmath41 , instead of the gauge field @xmath42 .",
    "the link - variable is defined as @xmath43 , with the lattice spacing @xmath44 and the gauge coupling constant @xmath45 .",
    "the gauge transformation of the link - variable is given by @xmath46 with the gauge function @xmath47 .    in lattice qcd",
    ", the landau gauge fixing is also expressed in terms of the link - variable : the landau gauge is defined by the maximization of @xmath48 by the gauge transformation of the link - variable .    for small @xmath44 ,",
    "using the expansion @xmath49 in terms of lattice spacing @xmath44 , @xmath50 is expressed as @xmath51 therefore , the maximization of @xmath50 corresponds to the minimization of the gauge - field fluctuation as well as the continuum theory .",
    "this minimization of the gluon - field fluctuation in turn justifies the expansion in eq.([eq : linkvariableexpansion ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we formulate the gluon propagator in the landau gauge . to begin with",
    ", we extract the gluon field from the gauge - fixed link - variable , which is obtained by the gauge transformation of the link - variable to maximize @xmath50 . using the expansion ( [ eq : linkvariableexpansion ] ) ,",
    "we define the bare gluon field @xmath52 as @xmath53   - \\frac{1}{2iagn_c } { \\rm tr } \\left [ u_\\mu(x ) - u_\\mu^\\dagger(x ) \\right ] , \\label{eq : gluonfield}\\ ] ] where the second term is added to make @xmath54 traceless .",

    "the color and tensor structure of the propagator is uniquely determined as @xmath73 from the @xmath22 global symmetry , the lorentz symmetry , and the transverse property , @xmath74 therefore , we only have to consider the scalar factor of the gluon propagator , @xmath75 , which is a function of the continuum - momentum squared @xmath76 .    in the coordinate space",
    ", we investigate the scalar combination of the gluon propagator @xmath77 as a function of the four - dimensional euclidean distance , @xmath78 here , the denominator factor @xmath79 in eq.([eq : defpropagator ] ) has been introduced considering the tensor factor @xmath80 .    the scalar factor @xmath81 in eq.([eq : gpmom ] )",

    "however , the reason to use the momentum representation would be less clear , compared with ordinary particles . in the ordinary particles , the momentum representation of the green function is clearly useful to express the pole structure , to distinguish the on - shell and off - shell states , and so on .",
    "however , for the confined field , there is no on - shell state , _",
    "i.e. _ , no physical asymptotic state , so that there is no definite reason to use the momentum representation , besides the total momentum conservation .",
    "indeed , it is difficult to image the non - zero momentum - space propagator with no pole , and the coordinate - space representation may be more convenient for some description of the confined field , similar to potential problems in quantum mechanics , where the coordinate - space wave - function is convenient .",

    ", there remain difficult problems related to the confinement mechanism , the infinite - volume limit , the gribov copies , and the gauge dependence .",

    "however , this is a fundamental problem in qcd , and it would be serious in the argument of the large - volume limit , so that it is also desired to remove the gribov copies and to extract the fundamental moduli region .    finally , we discuss the yukawa - type gluon propagation and a possible dimensional reduction due to the stochastic behavior of the gluon field in the infrared region . as shown in this paper , the landau - gauge gluon propagator is well described by the yukawa function in _ four_-dimensional euclidean space - time . however , the yukawa function @xmath5 is a natural form in _ three_-dimensional euclidean space - time , since it is obtained by the three - dimensional fourier transformation of the ordinary massive propagator @xmath226 .",

    "we note that the gluon propagation in the qcd vacuum resembles the situation of the system coupled to the stochastic external field .",
    "in fact , as is indicated by a large positive value of the gluon condensate @xmath232 in the minkowski space , the qcd vacuum is filled with a strong color - magnetic field @xcite , which can contribute spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite , and the color - magnetic field is considered to be highly random at an infrared scale @xcite . since gluons interact each other , the propagating gluon is violently scattered by the other gluon fields which are randomly condensed in the qcd vacuum at the infrared scale , as schematically shown in fig.[figgluonprogagation ] .     a schematic figure for a propagating gluon in the qcd vacuum .",
    "the qcd vacuum is filled with color - magnetic fields which are stochastic at an infrared scale , and the gluon propagates in the random color - magnetic fields . ]    actually in the infrared region , the gluon field shows a strong randomness due to the strong interaction , and this infrared strong randomness is considered to be responsible for color confinement , as is indicated in strong - coupling lattice qcd @xcite . in the chiral random matrix theory for qcd @xcite , the infrared randomness of gluons is taken account as an essence of qcd in a simplified manner , and the gluon field is replaced by a gaussian - random external field coupled to the quark field .",
    "notice that there are two kinds of randomness in the gluon field : one is a completely - random gauge degree of freedom , which is fake , and the other is a net physical gluonic degree of freedom , which is not completely but highly random at the infrared scale . for the argument of physical randomness , these two concepts should be clearly divided , since the gauge degree of freedom is just a fake . even after the removal of the fake gauge degree of freedom by gauge fixing , the gluon field exhibits a strong randomness @xcite accompanying a quite large fluctuation at the infrared scale .    as a generalization of the parisi - sourlas mechanism",
