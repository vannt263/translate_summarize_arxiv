    "one longstanding debate on quantum theory ( qt ) finds its origin in a logical discrepancy between the description of stationary and time - dependent quantum problems . to put it in the words of a.  bohm et al .",

    "further important questions arise : how about causality and four - momentum conservation when propagating from @xmath2 to @xmath3 or when asymptotic states interact through intermediate resonances ?",
    "why are only resonances / unstable particles treated like ( anti)gamow states with complex energy eigenvalues while other states are associated in the traditional manner with real eigenvalues ?",
    "how is the formalism generalized to quantum field theory ( qft ) ?",
    "how about boost properties of spinors and polarization vectors of resonances / unstable particles described by ( anti)gamow vectors ?",
    "how about aspects like gauge invariance in the presence of resonances which are relevant in describing e.g.  the excitation of intermediate vector - bosons like @xmath4 or @xmath5 ?",
    "considering the schrdinger equation as a particular limit of the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation it is advantageous to introduce first the formalism of ( a)cqt within the context of relativistic qft theory and then to consider its limit to schrdinger s representation of qm .",

    "in fact , imposing constraints prior to the solution of the equations of motion can lead one to erroneous conclusions . in parallel , in quantum field theory we adopt the premise that non - hermitian solutions of the field equations are acceptable .",
