    "starburst galaxies are complex environments with intense star formation , `` clumpy , '' multi - phase interstellar gas , supernovae - driven winds , and tangled magnetic fields .",
    "it is remarkable , then , that despite drastically different environments , both quiescent and star - forming disk galaxies have a well - established linear correlation between their far - infrared ( fir ) and radio luminosities @xcite . in these systems",
    ", the fir - radio luminosity correlation suggests a fundamental relationship between the star formation processes , resulting in fir emission from dust heated by young , massive stars , and the cosmic ray population , producing radio synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons spiraling along magnetic field lines .    to explain the fir - radio luminosity correlation , the cosmic ray calorimeter model for starburst galaxies has been explored ( e.g. , *",

    "this model suggests that the energy imparted to cosmic rays by supernovae is entirely expended through observable emission within the starburst region .",
    "if this model holds for cosmic ray electrons , then the observed radio synchrotron emission should be solely dependent on the supernova rate and therefore on the star formation rate ( sfr ; there is , of course , also a dependence on magnetic field strength , but this too appears to be tied to the sfr ; @xcite ) . likewise ,",
    "if the model holds for cosmic ray protons , then we expect a similar relationship between the observed @xmath0-ray emission from pion production and the sfr .    in order to test the calorimeter model for starburst galaxies ,",
    "it is necessary to understand how cosmic rays sample the multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) as they undergo radiative , collisional , and advective losses within the starburst region . in an ism consisting of cold , molecular clouds embedded in a hot",
    ", low - density medium , cosmic rays will only sample the mean density of the ism if they are able to effectively enter the molecular clouds .",
    "the leading theory of cosmic ray acceleration suggests that energetic particles undergo first - order fermi acceleration @xcite , or diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at supernova shock fronts . additionally , cosmic rays may undergo second - order fermi acceleration @xcite in the diffuse ism .",
    "both first- and second - order fermi acceleration can only occur efficiently in low - density environments , where the acceleration mechanism can impart energies in excess of ionization losses and the small - scale magnetic field fluctuations which scatter the particles can propagate .",
    "for these reasons , the majority of cosmic rays are believed to be injected in the hot , low - density medium .",
    "the hot medium where cosmic rays are injected has a very large filling factor compared to the molecular gas .",
    "additionally , the hot medium may be actively advected from the region by a galactic wind . in order for the cosmic rays to sample the mean density of the ism",
    ", the magnetic field lines along which they propagate must intersect a sufficiently large number of molecular clouds , and the cosmic rays must remain within the region for a sufficiently long time before they are advected away . therefore , cosmic ray sampling of the mean density of the ism is far from a foregone conclusion .    lcccc distance & 3.9 mpc & 1 + radius sb & 200 pc & 2 + scale height sb & 100 pc & 2 + molecular gas mass & @xmath1 & 3,4 + wind speed ( optical ) & @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 & 5 + wind speed ( x - ray ) & @xmath4 km  s@xmath3 & 6    in this paper , we use monte carlo simulations to study cosmic ray sampling of an ism with properties similar to that of the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "we selected this galaxy for our study because it has a well - studied starburst region with well - observed masses of its multi - phase ism , galactic wind speed , and supernova rate . in m82 ,",
    "the ism consists of a hot , diffuse medium in which dense , warm , ionized gas and dense , cold , molecular clouds are found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , co measurements suggest that the galaxy contains @xmath1 of molecular gas that is largely found within clumpy clouds in the starburst region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , m82 has a well - observed galactic wind that travels approximately perpendicularly to the galactic plane and is believed to be primarily driven by supernova shock heating @xcite .",

    "* and references therein ) to as high as @xmath4 km  s@xmath3as suggested by x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "although we use properties suggestive of m82 in this study ( see table 1 for a summary ) , our analysis is applicable to many other such systems .    here",
    ", we evaluate how cosmic ray sampling of the ism in starburst galaxies is affected by the number of molecular clouds , the galactic wind speed , the extent to which the magnetic field is tangled , and the cosmic ray injection mechanism . in section 2",
    ", we describe our monte carlo simulation parameters and the calculation of an emissivity ratio used to quantify the sampling behavior of the cosmic ray population .",
    "section 3 details the results of our simulations and highlights the region of parameter space in which the emissivity ratio is elevated by a factor of a few . in section 4",
    ", we review our results , compare them to existing models , and discuss their implications for exploring the cosmic ray calorimeter model and constructing the time - dependent spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays .",
    "the multi - phase ism in the starburst region is modeled to consist of a hot , low - density medium in which cold molecular clouds are embedded .",
    "observations and numerical simulations suggest that the molecular medium consists of many clumpy , fragmented clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although @xmath6 of molecular gas has been detected in the starburst nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we take a conservative order of magnitude estimate of @xmath7 of molecular gas within our spherical starburst region of radius @xmath8 pc , corresponding to a mean number density @xmath9 @xmath10 . assuming that the upper limit on the maximum mass of giant molecular clouds in the milky way of @xmath11 is applicable to m82",
    ", this implies on the order of @xmath12 molecular clouds .",
    "we hold the total mass of molecular gas constant while varying the number of clouds from @xmath13 to @xmath14 clouds to explore both the nominal case ( @xmath15 ) as well as the limit of very small cloud numbers and very high cloud densities ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "each cloud is taken to have a volume of @xmath17 pc@xmath18 , and thus the clouds volume filling factor varies from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "note that we are explicitly neglecting the contribution of the hot , low - density medium to the density sampled by cosmic rays .",
    "due to the diffusive nature of particle motion along magnetic field lines ( which reduces their effective propagation speed from @xmath21 to the alfvn speed , @xmath22 ) , the contribution of the low - density gas is greater than the simple ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mean densities of the hot gas and the cold molecular gas , respectively .",
    "we estimate that this is approximately a 10% effect for the m82 environment . likewise ,",
    "warm ( @xmath26 k ) ionized gas , in addition to hot gas and cold molecular gas , is undoubtedly present and would also have a small effect on the model .",

    "we vary @xmath34 from 0 to 2000 km  s@xmath3 , with 500 km  s@xmath3nominally taken as the favored value @xcite .",
    "we assume the wind carries away the magnetic field lines embedded in the hot gas , together with the cosmic rays loaded onto the field lines , but that the molecular component remains behind .",
    "since the starburst region of m82 is highly turbulent , we expect the magnetic field to have a significant random component .",
    "cosmic ray propagation along tangled magnetic field lines is approximated as a random walk process governed by a mean free path , @xmath32 , which parameterizes the magnetic correlation length .",
    "as the magnetic geometry is not well known , we vary @xmath32 from @xmath39 pc to @xmath40 pc .",
    "a longer value of @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath41 pc ) was found to yield comparable results to the @xmath42 pc case . due to scattering by short wavelength alfvn waves generated by the cosmic ray streaming instability ,",
    "cosmic rays are taken to travel along the field lines at the alfvn speed , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "given a magnetic field strength @xmath43 @xmath44 g and an average density of the hot medium @xmath45",
    "@xmath10 @xcite , the alfvn speed is found to be @xmath46 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we use three methods of injecting the cosmic rays into the starburst region .",
    "first , we consider the simple scenario where all cosmic rays are injected at the center of the region .",
    "second , in accordance with models of distributed cosmic ray acceleration such as second - order fermi acceleration by interstellar turbulence , we inject the particles randomly throughout the region .",
    "finally , in agreement with models of point source cosmic ray acceleration such as first - order fermi acceleration by supernova shocks , we inject the particles at randomly chosen supernova shock sites .",
    "we choose 30 injection sites due to observational evidence from radio interferometry for @xmath47 30 active supernova remnants ( snrs ) in m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one might expect snrs and star - forming molecular clouds to spatially coincide , as young , massive stars are not likely to travel far from their place of birth over the course of their lifetimes .",
    "additionally , recent observations of @xmath0-ray emission from molecular clouds associated with snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide evidence for a spatial correlation between snrs and molecular clouds .",
    "thus , for our final injection method , our injection sites are chosen randomly on spheres of radius @xmath48 pc centered on clouds .",
    "for all cosmic ray injection methods , we disallow injection inside of clouds due to the reduced acceleration efficiency expected in cold , dense environments .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are run with @xmath49 particles for a given choice of @xmath30 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and cosmic ray injection mechanism ( see the appendix for a discussion of the number of particles necessary to achieve convergence ) . at the beginning of a run",
    ", we select the cosmic rays initial injection sites as well as a random molecular cloud distribution , and we map the state of the ism onto a three - dimensional grid with a resolution of 0.5 pc . starting from its injection site",
    ", a given particle executes a random walk governed by a mean free path @xmath32 broken down into steps of length @xmath50 pc . at each step , the contribution of advection to the particle motion , the component of the ism being sampled ( in / out of cloud ) , and the particle s presence in the starburst region ( in / out of region ) are assessed .",
    "if a particle is inside of a cloud at the beginning of a step , the galactic wind does not act on the particle for that step , and the particle is taken to travel at the speed of light instead of at the alfvn speed .",
    "the particles are taken to free - stream inside of molecular clouds due to the destruction by ion - neutral damping of alfvn waves resulting from the streaming instability @xcite .",
    "the particle is scattered when it has traveled a distance equal to its mean free path , and the process repeats until the particle has traveled out of the region .",
    "note that we do not explicitly model energy losses along the particle trajectories , deferring a discussion of it to section [ sec_disc ] .",
    "the cloud column densities ( @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath14 clouds ; @xmath53 @xmath52 , @xmath13 clouds ) are well below the characteristic column densities for energy loss ( @xmath54 @xmath52 , @xmath55 gev ; @xmath56 @xmath52 , @xmath55 tev ) except for very small @xmath30 and/or very high proton energies .",
    "this suggests that cosmic rays make several passes though clouds before undergoing collisional energy losses .",
    "see table 2 for a summary of our model parameters .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the sampling behavior of the cosmic rays for a single representative run of the monte carlo code . for each @xmath32",
    ", we show distributions of the total distance traveled , the total distance traveled in molecular clouds , and the average density sampled ( @xmath57 ) normalized to the mean density of the ism in the starburst region ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is clear from the density distributions that the particles display a diverse range of sampling behaviors .",
    "the extremes of this behavior are seen in the peaks at @xmath59 , where no clouds are sampled , as well as in the tails at @xmath60 , where the particles sample densities as high as an order of magnitude greater than the mean density of the ism .",
    "note that for @xmath61 , a peak appears near @xmath62 .",
    "these trends hint that as we proceed to more precisely quantify the sampling behavior , we may reasonably expect the particles to roughly sample the mean density of the ism over much of parameter space",
    ".      to quantitatively assess the assumption that cosmic rays sample the mean density of the ism in the starburst region and evaluate its effect on @xmath0-ray emission , we use our simulation results to construct a function @xmath63 , which gives the fraction of cosmic rays that sample gas density @xmath64 relative to the mean density @xmath65 .",
    "the emissivity due to pion production by cosmic rays in molecular clouds is then given by @xmath66 where @xmath64 and @xmath67 are the number densities of the medium and the cosmic rays , respectively , @xmath68 is the cross section for pion production , @xmath69 is the velocity of the particles , and @xmath70 is the energy produced by the interaction .",
    "if the cosmic rays do indeed sample the mean density of the ism , the emissivity is given by @xmath71 thus , the ratio of emissivities @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 although @xmath68 is a function of energy , @xmath72 is independent of energy for all cosmic rays that satisfy the propagation assumptions given at the beginning of this section ( i.e. , the streaming instability results in propagation at the alfvn speed ) .",
    "@xmath72 is easily obtained by appropriately normalizing , binning , and summing over the distributions of average densities sampled weighted by the densities themselves ( see , e.g. , figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "thus , we determine @xmath72 for the range of parameters discussed in section 2.1 and seek areas of parameter space where @xmath72 departs significantly from unity .",
    "see the appendix for a discussion of our determination of @xmath72 for a given choice of @xmath30 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and cosmic ray injection mechanism .",
    "the appendix also details our estimation of the errors on @xmath72 that originate from both the finite number of particles per run as well as the changes in the random cloud distributions and injection sites from run to run .",
    "we begin by examining the densities sampled over the entire range of parameters considered in this study ( i.e. , all combinations of cosmic ray mean free path , injection mechanism , two molecular cloud numbers ( @xmath13 , @xmath74 clouds ) , and three wind speeds ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 km  s@xmath3 ) ) . in figure 2",
    ", we see that the cosmic rays roughly sample the mean density of the ism over much of parameter space .",
    "overall , we do not achieve emissivities suppressed below @xmath78 by a factor of more than @xmath79 ; we do achieve emissivities elevated above @xmath78 by a factor of a few ; and these modestly elevated emissivities occur only for cosmic ray injection near clouds in the limit of small cloud number and thus high cloud density . this case will be considered separately in section 3.2 .",
    "although @xmath80 over much of parameter space , there are still clear trends relating @xmath72 to @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , and cosmic ray injection mechanism .",
    "we note that @xmath72 tends to increase as @xmath32 decreases , suggesting that cosmic rays with short @xmath32 generally travel along more convoluted trajectories and thus spend more time sampling the starburst region as well as the clouds that they encounter .",
    "we also note a somewhat greater spread in @xmath72 at shorter @xmath32 that may be due to more frequent scattering allowing for more varied paths through the starburst region and thus more varied emissivity outcomes .    for cosmic ray injection near clouds and randomly throughout the region , @xmath72 tends to decrease as @xmath34 increases .",
    "when injection occurs far from the midplane , the particle s trajectory is immediately affected by the wind , and advective losses dominate . however , for injection at the center of the region and short @xmath32 , @xmath72 instead increases with @xmath34 . for central injection",
    ", the particle initially experiences very weak wind speeds , and advective losses are negligible .",
    "additionally , for higher @xmath34 , these particles may travel along more efficient trajectories and thus sample more clouds than for lower @xmath34 , where they travel more convoluted trajectories and are more likely to circumvent clouds .",
    "the cosmic ray injection mechanism also has other effects on the value of @xmath72 . at a given @xmath32 , emissivities from injection at the center of the starburst region",
    "exceed those of injection randomly throughout the region , while injection near clouds in the case of @xmath14 clouds tends to fall between these two limiting cases .",
    "it is expected that cosmic rays injected at the center have the opportunity to sample greater densities than those injected randomly because they generally spend more time within the starburst region .",
    "additionally , cosmic rays injected near clouds in the @xmath81 clouds case are expected to sample greater densities than those injected randomly because of their initial proximity to clouds . however , as these cosmic rays also sample lesser densities than those injected at the center of the region , it appears that this effect is outweighed by the relatively shorter time spent within the region .",
    "finally , @xmath30 has a clear effect on the value of @xmath72 , albeit one moderated by injection mechanism .",
    "when cosmic rays are injected near clouds and thus have ample opportunity to encounter dense gas , a smaller number of denser clouds produces a higher emissivity than a larger number of less dense clouds .",
    "however , when cosmic rays are randomly injected , they have a decreased likelihood of encountering dense gas ; thus , despite the increase in cloud density , the decrease in cloud number may suppress the emissivity such that the results are comparable for both a low and high number of clouds .",
    "we now discuss the region of parameter space where the cosmic rays sample the highest densities .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the cosmic rays achieve the highest @xmath72 values ( @xmath82 ) when injected near the molecular clouds in the limit of small cloud number ( @xmath13 clouds ) and thus high cloud density .",
    "this result is not surprising , as cosmic ray injection near high - density molecular gas has the greatest likelihood of interaction between the particles and the molecular medium .",
    "as noted in section 3.1 , the value of @xmath72 is highest for short @xmath32 ( @xmath83 pc ) , where @xmath72 varies from @xmath79 - @xmath84 , than for longer @xmath32 , where @xmath72 is @xmath79 - @xmath85 .",
    "in addition to spending more time sampling the starburst region , particles with short @xmath32 may also be more likely to enter the clouds accompanying their injection sites than those that are able to travel more efficiently away .",
    "as is clear in figure 3 , the case of no galactic wind results in @xmath72 values lower than that of high wind ( @xmath86 km  s@xmath3 ) by a factor of @xmath79 , while the case of moderate wind ( @xmath87 km  s@xmath3 ) results in intermediate emissivities . at short",
    "@xmath32 , the cases of high and moderate @xmath34 become comparable",
    ". particles that are injected between the galactic plane and their accompanying cloud are likely to be advected into the cloud in the presence of a wind ; the likelihood of this occurring may increase with @xmath34 .",
    "particles with short @xmath32 also have an increased likelihood of entering the clouds at their injection sites due to their inability to efficiently travel away from these sites , rendering the emissivity less sensitive to @xmath34 .    in summary , cosmic ray injection near @xmath13 clouds for short @xmath32 and moderate to high @xmath34 results in @xmath72 values that are modestly elevated above @xmath78 by a factor of a few .",
    "note that the uncertainty associated with these emissivities increases dramatically in the limit of short @xmath32 and high @xmath34 .",
    "the former dependence suggests that particles that experience more frequent scattering travel along more diverse trajectories and thus have more diverse emissivity outcomes .",
    "additionally , the latter dependence implies that a higher @xmath34 results in greater populations of particles that are rapidly advected away ( resulting in low emissivities ) as well as particles that enter the clouds near their injection sites ( high emissivities ) .",
    "therefore , although this region of parameter space results in elevated emissivities , the nature of the random cloud and injection point distributions is important in determining the observed emissivity .",
    "we have now seen that cosmic rays injected near @xmath13 high - density clouds sample densities in excess of the mean density of the ism , while those injected near @xmath14 lower density clouds do not .",
    "thus , for the case of injection near clouds , we seek an upper limit on the number of clouds necessary to achieve elevated emissivities . in figure 4 , we consider @xmath72 for @xmath87 km  s@xmath3and a range of @xmath30 values for which @xmath88 clouds .",
    "it is clear that very low values of @xmath30 are required to achieve elevated emissivities . for the shortest @xmath32 ,",
    "decreasing @xmath30 from @xmath74 to @xmath89 clouds increases @xmath72 by only a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "it is only when @xmath30 is decreased to @xmath90 clouds that @xmath72 becomes elevated by a factor of a few .",
    "thus , in the case of cosmic ray injection near clouds , a very small cloud number and thus very high cloud density is required to achieve elevated emissivities .",
    "we now consider the fraction of cosmic rays that escape from the starburst region without sampling molecular clouds at all .",
    "this sheds light on the relationship between the sampling behavior of individual particles and the sampling of the particle population as a whole . in figure 5 , it is clear that over the full parameter space considered , the fraction @xmath91 of cosmic rays that escape from the starburst region without sampling clouds ranges from near complete sampling ( @xmath92 , @xmath14 clouds , @xmath93 km  s@xmath3 , injection at the center ) to near complete escape ( @xmath94 , @xmath13 , @xmath86 km  s@xmath3 , random injection ) . as we found that cosmic rays approximately sample the mean density of the ism over much of parameter space",
    ", we see that emissivity values of @xmath95 are achieved over the full range in @xmath91",
    ". therefore , we may find @xmath95 both when the vast majority of particles sample roughly the mean density ( occurring mainly for high @xmath30 values ) , as well as when only a small minority of particles encounter the molecular medium ( mainly low @xmath30 values ) .",
    "when we are interested in the mean density sampled by the cosmic ray population as a whole , such as when evaluating the cosmic ray calorimeter model , these two broad sampling behaviors can be considered comparable .",
    "however , if large numbers of cosmic rays escape from the starburst region without losing energy to collisional processes in the molecular medium , this may have important implications for the galactic environment .",
    "it has been shown that when the cosmic rays are self - confined , meaning that they generate the waves that trap them , they may contribute to driving a galactic wind @xcite .",
    "thus , we may be more likely to observe a galactic wind under conditions for which cosmic rays are able to travel through the hot medium to escape the starburst region without undergoing energy losses in molecular clouds .",
    "we now discuss our monte carlo simulations in the context of a simple , `` back of the envelope '' model of cosmic ray sampling of a clumpy ism .",
    "we refer to the model in section 4.1 of @xcite adapted to account for diffusive cosmic ray propagation .",
    "this model suggests that cosmic rays will sample the mean density of the ism if two general conditions are met .",
    "first , the magnetic field lines along which they propagate must pass through a representative sample of the varied components of the ism .",
    "second , they must be able to travel along or diffuse across field lines to encounter these components before they are advected from the region . to determine whether these conditions are met , we compare the timescale @xmath96 for cosmic rays to diffuse between clouds to the timescale @xmath97 for them to be advected from the region .",
    "we define the former as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the mean distance between clouds and the factor of @xmath100 accounts for cosmic ray diffusion with a mean free path @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath99 can be approximated as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the radius of the starburst region .",
    "we take @xmath99 to be the mean minimum distance that cosmic rays must travel to reach a cloud assuming that there is no spatial correlation between clouds and cosmic ray injection sites . for this reason ,",
    "this model is applicable only to cosmic rays traveling along sufficiently tangled magnetic field lines ( @xmath104 ) and to cosmic rays that have been injected either centrally or randomly in the starburst region .",
    "we define the condition under which cosmic rays will encounter molecular clouds to be @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the advection timescale for cosmic rays that experience a mean advecting wind speed of @xmath107 .",
    "taking @xmath108 km  s@xmath3 , @xmath87 km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath8 pc , we arrive at a relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath32 that predicts whether or not cosmic rays are able to encounter clouds before being advected from the starburst region : @xmath109    we now compare this prediction with the results of our monte carlo simulations .",
    "considering broadly the predictions of equation ( 6 ) for central or random cosmic ray injection , @xmath87 km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath104 , this prediction suggests that for all but the shortest @xmath32 , cosmic rays should encounter dense gas for both @xmath13 and @xmath74 clouds . for central injection , there is very good agreement between this prediction and our simulation results , as our @xmath72 values are indeed close to unity . for random injection",
    ", however , there is only very broad agreement , as @xmath72 is instead close to @xmath110 .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising for the case of random injection , as our simple model does not account for the effective decrease in the advection timescale for particles injected considerably closer than @xmath8 pc to the edge of the region .",
    "additionally , for @xmath111 pc , equation ( 6 ) suggests that we require @xmath112 clouds for the cosmic rays to encounter dense gas .",
    "for central cosmic ray injection , however , we find from our simulations that the cosmic rays do indeed interact with dense gas for both @xmath13 and @xmath74 clouds . for random injection",
    ", we again find that the value of @xmath72 is relatively insensitive to cloud number .",
    "this discrepancy is due to our simple model s inability to account for the effect of increasing cloud density with decreasing cloud number . in our simulations ,",
    "we find that despite fewer cosmic rays sampling clouds in the limit of small cloud number , we still observe emissivities comparable to those found for larger cloud numbers due to the increase in cloud density .",
    "thus , our simple model is useful for broadly considering constraints on the conditions for cosmic ray sampling of molecular clouds .",
    "however , this model solely suggests whether or not cosmic rays encounter dense gas .",
    "we have seen that the observed emissivity is dependent not only on getting cosmic rays to the gas , but on additional properties such as the gas density as well .",
    "thus , for accurately predicting observed emissivities , our full monte carlo simulations are required to account for all relevant subtleties .",
    "the starburst calorimeter model suggests that there is a direct relationship between the energy imparted to cosmic rays by supernovae and the energy lost by cosmic rays within the starburst region .",
    "thus , there is a relationship between the supernova rate , and therefore the sfr , and observable emission in the radio ( cosmic ray electrons ) and @xmath0-ray ( cosmic ray protons ) regimes . here",
    ", we evaluate the extent to which our simulated starburst region behaves as a cosmic ray calorimeter under a range of physical conditions by comparing the particles confinement timescales @xmath113 to their energy loss timescales @xmath114 .",
    "note that as starburst galaxies with properties like those of m82 are well established to be effective cosmic ray electron calorimeters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will consider only cosmic ray protons for the remainder of our analysis .",
    "the cosmic ray transport equation gives rise to the functional form of @xmath114 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we may assume that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are of the form @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the total energy loss rate .",
    "for the steady state , the energy loss rate @xmath114 is then found to be @xmath127    the energy loss rates for cosmic ray protons are due primarily to ionization and pion production , the latter of which is dominant above @xmath128 gev @xcite . note that we do not account for the ( negligible ) contribution from coulomb effects .",
    "the energy loss rates from both ionization and pion production are directly proportional to the average density sampled by the particles , defined as the mean density of the ism modified by a multiplicative factor of @xmath72 , @xmath129 .",
    "we define the confinement timescale @xmath113 for a given @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and cosmic ray injection mechanism as the median time that @xmath130 particles take to escape from the starburst region .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the confinement to energy loss timescales @xmath131 and seek physical conditions where the calorimeter model fails to hold ( @xmath132 ) .    in figure 6 , we show @xmath131 for @xmath55 gev and @xmath55 tev protons over the full parameter space considered . at a given energy ,",
    "the value of @xmath131 ranges over more than three orders of magnitude and is strongly dependent on @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and the cosmic ray injection mechanism . for the lowest energy protons ( @xmath133 gev ) , @xmath134 for all parameters considered , and the starburst region is an effective proton calorimeter . at moderate proton energies ( @xmath135 gev ) , however",
    ", @xmath131 only exceeds unity for all @xmath32 in the absence of a galactic wind .",
    "additionally , @xmath131 does not exceed unity for the longest @xmath32 for any parameters considered . at higher energies ( @xmath136 tev ) ,",
    "@xmath131 again exceeds unity in all cases except that of large @xmath30 , high @xmath34 , and injection throughout the region .",
    "thus , for moderate to high proton energies , our simulated starburst region can only be deemed a partial proton calorimeter without further knowledge of the physical conditions in the region .",
    "note that the starburst region would be calorimetric over larger portions of parameter space if we had made a more generous estimate of the molecular gas mass contained within the region .",
    "we conclude by constructing the spectrum of a cosmic ray burst from a single supernova explosion and evaluating how the time evolution of the spectrum is affected by the density sampled by the particles .",
    "although the steady state solution is generally preferred for the cosmic ray populations of starburst galaxies , the behavior of a burst of cosmic rays may inform our understanding of how smaller scale cosmic ray populations evolve over short timescales . here , we again consider only cosmic ray protons , as only a small minority of a supernova s energy is believed to be imparted to cosmic ray electrons @xcite .    to construct the spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays , we begin by dropping both the source and the advection terms from the cosmic ray transport equation ; the advection term will be added later .",
    "thus , we have @xmath137,\\ ] ] where we define the energy loss rate to be @xmath138 for initial condition @xmath139 , one can show that @xmath140 takes the form : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the energy at time @xmath143 of a particle with energy @xmath118 at time @xmath117 .",
    "we now restore the advection term to the cosmic ray transport equation : @xmath137    - \\frac{n(e , t)}{\\tau_{c}}.\\ ] ] we consider the case where @xmath140 assumes the form @xmath144 . by substituting this expression into the transport equation with advective losses added , we discover that @xmath145 is a solution of this equation when advective losses are neglected .",
    "thus , we obtain an expression for @xmath140 accounting for advective losses by multiplying our previous expression for @xmath140 by a factor of @xmath146 .",
    "additionally , we assume that the initial injected spectrum is a power law @xmath147 with spectral index @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays has the functional form : @xmath149    to find the initial energy @xmath150 given the energy @xmath118 at time @xmath117 , we solve for the value of @xmath150 that satisfies @xmath151 this is done by selecting a value for @xmath150 , numerically integrating backward , and evaluating the consistency of the resulting @xmath152 with the desired time @xmath117 .    finally , we determine the value of @xmath153 in order to satisfy : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the energy released by a supernova explosion , @xmath156 is the fraction of a supernova s energy transferred to cosmic rays , and @xmath157 is the volume of the starburst region . therefore , @xmath153 has the functional form : @xmath158 where we take @xmath159 , @xmath160 gev , @xmath161 erg , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 cm@xmath18 . note that we take the cosmic ray acceleration timescale in a supernova shock to be @xmath165 yr @xmath166 , and thus @xmath167 can be taken to be effectively instantaneous .",
    "the time evolution of the spectrum is shown in the upper panel of figure 7 for @xmath78 and @xmath168 yr .",
    "this choice of @xmath72 and @xmath113 is consistent with much of the parameter space considered . as in section 4.2 , the energy loss rates for cosmic ray protons are calculated according to @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the spectrum evolves rapidly with time ; on timescales comparable to the confinement time , the number density decreases by several orders of magnitude at all energies .",
    "this decline is most dramatic at high energies ( @xmath169 gev ) , where the spectrum steepens sharply by @xmath170 yr due to extreme energy loss rates as well as the initial lack of high - energy particles .    in the lower panel of figure 7",
    ", we show the spectrum at time @xmath171 yr for a range of densities sampled .",
    "it is clear that increasing the value of @xmath72 by a factor of a few rapidly decreases the lifetime of the particle population .",
    "for example , by comparing the top and bottom panels of figure 7 , we see that the spectrum of a cosmic ray burst with @xmath78 that has evolved for @xmath172 yr is identical to the spectrum of a burst with @xmath173 that has evolved for only @xmath174 yr .",
    "overall , the spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays evolves rapidly under the physical conditions of a starburst galaxy like m82 , and thus the cosmic ray population produced by a single supernova explosion under these conditions is a short - lived phenomenon .",
    "however , a conservative estimate of the supernova rate in m82 is @xmath175 yr@xmath3 @xcite , and thus we can expect that a supernova explosion will occur in m82 every @xmath176 yr . the evolved cosmic ray spectra shown in figure 7 will therefore never be made manifest , and instead will be regularly replenished by newly injected particles .",
    "however , in other star - forming environments where the supernova rate may be very low , such as extreme dwarf galaxies or ob associations , these spectra may indeed be manifested due to a lack of replenishing particles .",
    "in the interest of understanding how cosmic rays sample the clumpy ism in a starburst environment , we have undertaken monte carlo simulations of cosmic ray sampling of molecular clouds under the physical conditions of the archetypal starburst galaxy m82 . here , we briefly review the results of our study :    * cosmic rays sample roughly the mean density of the ism ( @xmath95 ) for a wide range of assumptions about the number of molecular clouds , the galactic wind speed , the extent to which the magnetic field is tangled , and the cosmic ray injection mechanism .",
    "a value of @xmath95 is consistent with models of the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum of m82 @xcite .",
    "* cosmic rays sample densities a factor of a few higher than the mean density ( @xmath82 ) in the case of a small number of dense molecular clouds , injection close to the clouds , and a highly tangled magnetic field . *",
    "the fraction of cosmic rays that escape from the starburst region without sampling molecular clouds ranges from @xmath177 for physical conditions that yield @xmath95 .",
    "this suggests that although the sampling behavior of the cosmic ray population as a whole is largely independent of the physical conditions , the behavior of individual particles is not . *",
    "our simulated starburst region is at least a partial cosmic ray proton calorimeter , and appears to be a complete calorimeter at all proton energies for no galactic wind and short cosmic ray mean free path .",
    "* we construct the time - dependent spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays , and demonstrate that the spectrum evolves rapidly under the physical conditions of m82 .",
    "however , these spectra are only made manifest in environments with very low supernova rates ( @xmath178 yr@xmath3 ) where the spectra are not continuously replenished with energetic particles .",
    "though we have illustrated several applications here , cosmic ray sampling of a clumpy ism may be applied to a wide range of science goals seeking to understand the relationship between the state of the multi - phase ism , the star formation processes , and the cosmic ray populations of starburst galaxies .",

    "we calculated a new value of @xmath72 for each selected sample and fit the resulting distributions in @xmath72 with gaussian profiles to determine their standard deviations .",
    "as we are primarily interested in areas of parameter space where @xmath72 departs significantly from unity , our purposes are easily served by uncertainties in @xmath72 on the order of @xmath182 . in figure 8",
    ", we show an example of the resulting distributions in @xmath72 with a range of sample sizes .    for a sample size of @xmath49 particles , the spreads of the resulting gaussian distributions ( @xmath183 ) range from @xmath184 ( for @xmath14 clouds , @xmath75 km  s@xmath3 , and central injection ) to @xmath185 ( for @xmath13 clouds , @xmath86 km  s@xmath3 , and random injection ) .",
    "decreasing the sample size to @xmath186 particles increases @xmath183 by @xmath187 , and to @xmath188 particles increases @xmath183 by more than @xmath189 . additionally , the case of @xmath190 clouds and injection randomly throughout the region results in skewed distributions with significant tails toward high emissivities for @xmath191 and @xmath192 particles , although the skew is negligible for @xmath193 particles .",
    "thus , we select @xmath49 particles as the number of particles necessary to achieve convergence , because this sample size allows @xmath183 to remain below or comparable to @xmath182 and our resampled distributions to remain gaussian across the full parameter space .",
    "_ error estimation . _",
    "the generally dominant source of uncertainty in @xmath72 for a given choice of @xmath30 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 , and cosmic ray injection mechanism is associated with the changes in the molecular cloud and injection site distributions from run to run . to quantify this uncertainty , we ran repeated runs varying only the cloud distribution ( for central injection ) or the cloud and injection site distributions ( for the other injection methods ) until sufficiently sampled emissivity distributions were obtained ( i.e. , @xmath194 runs ) .",
    "as shown in figure 9 , the shape and spread of the emissivity distributions are dependent on the cosmic ray injection mechanism .",
    "random injection results in fairly gaussian distributions with modest spreads ( @xmath195 - @xmath196 ) , while the other injection methods result in slightly to severely skewed distributions with sparsely populated tails at high emissivities . these latter injection mechanisms also result in significant spreads ( @xmath197 - @xmath198 , injection at center ; @xmath199 - @xmath200 , injection near clouds ) .",
