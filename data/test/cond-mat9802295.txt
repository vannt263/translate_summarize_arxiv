    "over the past 15 years , the study of the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) from the point of view of statistical physics has been gaining added currency , as theoreticians have improved their understanding of the relation between combinatorial optimization and disordered systems .",
    "the tsp may be stated as follows : given @xmath4 sites ( or `` cities '' ) , find the total length @xmath5 of the shortest closed path ( `` tour '' ) passing through all cities exactly once . in the stochastic tsp ,",
    "the matrix of distances separating pairs of cities is drawn randomly from an ensemble .",
    "the ensemble that has received the most attention in the physics community is the _",
    "random link _ case , where the individual lengths @xmath0 between city @xmath1 and city @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) are taken to be independent random variables , all identically distributed according to some @xmath7 .",
    "the idea of looking at this random link ensemble , rather than the more traditional `` random point '' ensemble where cities are distributed uniformly in euclidean space , originated with an attempt by kirkpatrick and toulouse @xcite to find a version of the tsp analogous to the earlier sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite for spin glasses .",
    "the great advantage of working with the random link tsp , rather than the ( random point ) euclidean tsp , is that one may realistically hope for an analytical solution .",
    "a major breakthrough occurred with the idea , first formulated by mzard and parisi @xcite and later developed by krauth and mzard @xcite , that the random link tsp could be solved using the _ cavity method _ , an approach inspired by work on spin glasses .",
    "this method is based on assumptions pertaining to properties of the system under certain limiting conditions .",
    "the most important of these assumptions is replica symmetry .",
    "although in the case of spin glasses , replica symmetry is violated @xcite , for the tsp there are various grounds for at least _ suspecting _ that replica symmetry holds @xcite .",
    "the cavity solution then leads to a system of integral equations that can be solved  numerically at least  to give a prediction of the optimum tour length @xmath5 in the many - city limit @xmath8 .    in a previous article @xcite",
    ", we have taken the random link distribution @xmath7 to match that of the distribution of individual city - to - city distances in the euclidean case , using the random link tsp as a _",
    "random link approximation _ to the euclidean tsp .",
    "the approximation may seem crude since it neglects all correlations between euclidean distances , such as the triangle inequality .",
    "nevertheless , it gives remarkably good results .",
    "in particular , a numerical solution of the random link cavity equations predicts large @xmath4 optimum tour lengths that are within 2% of the ( simulated ) @xmath9-dimensional euclidean values , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the limit @xmath12 , this gap shows all signs of disappearing .",
    "the random link problem , and its cavity prediction , is thus more closely related to the euclidean problem than one might expect .",
    "the random link tsp is also , however , interesting in itself .",
    "little numerical work has accompanied the analytical progress made  a shortcoming made all the more troubling by the uncertainties surrounding the cavity method s assumptions . in this paper",
    "we attempt to redress the imbalance , providing a numerical study of the finite size scaling of the random link optimum tour length , and arguments suggesting that the cavity solution is in fact correct . in the process ,",
    "our numerics reveal some remarkable properties concerning the frequencies with which cities are connected to their @xmath3th - nearest neighbor in optimal tours ; we invite a theoretical explanation of these properties .",
    "in an attempt to apply tools from statistical mechanics to optimization problems , kirkpatrick and toulouse @xcite introduced a particularly simple case of the random link tsp .",
    "the distribution of link lengths @xmath0 was taken to be uniform , so that @xmath7 is constant over a fixed interval . in light of the random link approximation",
    ", one may think of this as corresponding , at large @xmath4 , to the 1-d euclidean case .",
    "( when cities are randomly and uniformly distributed on a line segment , the distribution of lengths between pairs of cities is uniform . )",
    "although the 1-d euclidean case is trivial  particularly if we adopt periodic boundary conditions , in which case the optimum tour length is simply the length of the line segment  the corresponding random link problem is far from trivial .",
    "the simulations performed by kirkpatrick and toulouse suggested a random link optimum tour length value of @xmath13 in the @xmath8 limit . on @xmath14 .",
    "the 1-d euclidean value , for comparison , would thus be @xmath15 .",
    "kirkpatrick and toulouse , among others , choose instead @xmath16 on @xmath17 , contributing an additional factor of 2 in @xmath18 which we omit when quoting their results . ] mzard and parisi @xcite attempted to improve both upon this estimate and upon the theory by using replica techniques often employed in spin glass problems ( for a discussion of the replica method in this context , see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach allowed them to obtain , via a saddle point approximation , many orders of the high - temperature expansion for the internal energy .",
    "they then extrapolated down to zero temperature  corresponding to the global tsp optimum  finding @xmath19 .",
    "their analysis , like that of kirkpatrick and toulouse , was carried out only for the case of @xmath7 equal to a constant .",
    "given the difficulties of pushing the replica method further , mzard and parisi then tried a different but related approach known as the _ cavity _ method @xcite .",
    "this uses a mean - field approximation which , in the case of spin glasses , gives the same result as the replica method in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath8 ) . as much of the literature on the cavity method",
    "has been prohibitively technical to non - specialists , we shall review the approach in more conventional language here , indicating what is involved in the case of the tsp .    both the replica and the cavity methods involve a representation of the partition function originally developed in the context of polymer theory @xcite .",
    "the approach consists of mapping the tsp onto an @xmath20-component spin system , writing down the partition function at temperature @xmath21 , and then taking the limit @xmath22 .",
    "more explicitly , consider @xmath4 spins @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( corresponding to the @xmath4 cities ) , where each spin @xmath23 has @xmath20 components @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the partition function is defined , in terms of a parameter @xmath28 , as @xmath29 \\label{eq_partfunc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral is taken over all possible values spin values ( the area measure is normalized so that @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 is related to the length @xmath0 between city @xmath1 and city @xmath2 as @xmath32 .",
    "now employ a classic diagrammatic argument : let each spin product @xmath33 appearing in the series be represented by an edge in a graph whose vertices are the @xmath4 cities .",
    "the first - order terms ( @xmath28 ) will consist of one - edge diagrams , the second - order terms ( @xmath34 ) will consist of two - edge diagrams , and so on .",
    "what then happens when we integrate over all spin configurations ? if there is a spin @xmath35 that occurs only once in a given diagram , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is an endpoint , the spherical symmetry of @xmath35 will cause the whole expression to vanish . the non - vanishing summation terms in ( [ eq_partfunc ] )",
    "therefore correspond only to `` closed '' diagrams , where there is at least one loop .",
    "it may furthermore be shown that in performing the integration , any one of these closed diagrams will contribute a factor @xmath20 for every loop present in the diagram @xcite .",
    "if we then consider @xmath36 and take the limit @xmath22 , it is clear that only diagrams with a single loop will remain . furthermore , since any closed diagram with more than @xmath4 links must necessarily contain more than one loop , only diagrams up to order @xmath37 will remain .",
    "finally , take the limit @xmath38 . the term that will then dominate in ( [ eq_partfunc ] )",
    "is the order @xmath37 term which , being a single loop diagram , represents precisely a closed tour passing through all @xmath4 cities .",
    "we may write it without the combinatorial factor @xmath39 by expressing it as a sum over ordered pairs in the tour , and we thus find : @xmath40 where @xmath5 is the total tour length .",
    "what we obtain is exactly the partition function for the traveling salesman problem , with the correct canonical ensemble boltzmann weights , using the tour length as the energy to be minimized ( up to a factor @xmath41 , necessary for the energy to be extensive ) .",
    "the idea behind the cavity method is as follows .",
    "since all spin couplings @xmath31 in ( [ eq_partfuncunexpanded ] ) are positive ( ferromagnetic ) , we expect the @xmath20-component spin system to have a non - zero spontaneous magnetization in equilibrium .",
    "now add an @xmath42th spin to the system ; it too acquires a spontaneous magnetization @xmath43 .",
    "let us obtain the thermodynamic observables of the new system ( in particular @xmath43 itself ) in terms of the earlier magnetizations @xmath44 from _ before _ the @xmath42th spin was added  hence the notion of a `` cavity '' .    in order to compute these relations ,",
    "an important mean - field assumption is made : that at large @xmath4 , any effect spin @xmath45 feels from correlations among the @xmath4 other spins is negligible .",
    "we justify this in the following way .",
    "although all spins in ( [ eq_partfuncunexpanded ] ) are indeed coupled , the coupling constants @xmath31 decrease exponentially with length @xmath0 , and so effective interactions arise only between very near neighbors .",
    "but a crucial property of the random link model is that the near neighbors of spin @xmath45 are _ not _ generally near neighbors of one another : they are near neighbors of one another only with probability @xmath46 .",
    "thus , when considering quantities involving spin @xmath45 , the effect of direct interactions between any two of its neighbors is @xmath46 , and decays to zero in the limit @xmath8 . we therefore replace ( [ eq_partfuncunexpanded ] ) by the mean - field partition function @xmath47    by definition , if spin @xmath45 were removed , we would recover the `` cavity magnetizations '' @xmath44 .",
    "this requirement is sufficient to specify the fields @xmath48 .",
    "stripping out spin @xmath45 from ( [ eq_zmf ] ) leaves us simply with a product of integrals @xmath49 , whose logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath48 must then give the magnetization @xmath44 .",
    "we may obtain this expression by expanding the integrands , taking advantage of the identity @xmath50 for all spin components @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as well as the nilpotency property  @xcite that in the limit @xmath22 , integrating the product of _ more _ than two components of @xmath23 gives zero .",
    "( this is analogous to the property used earlier in the diagrammatic expansion . )",
    "the result is @xmath53 note that this specifies @xmath48 for @xmath54 ; @xmath55 has been introduced purely for analytical convenience , and will ultimately be set to 0 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume the spontaneous magnetizations of the system to be directed exclusively along component 1 .",
    "this may be imposed , for instance , by applying an additional infinitesimal field directed along component 1 .",
    "physically , however , the assumption that distant spins are uncorrelated also means that this infinitesimal field is sufficient to select a single phase or equilibrium state , thus giving rise to a unique thermodynamic limit . from the point of view of dynamics ,",
    "a consequence is that two `` copies '' of the system will evolve to the same equilibrium distribution .",
    "this property is known as _ replica symmetry _ , and has been central to the modern understanding of disordered systems .",
    "replica symmetry is in fact known to be broken in spin glasses ; if one uses , for instance , the replica symmetric solution of the sk model , one finds a ground state energy prediction that is inaccurate by about @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that replica symmetry breaking occurs in _ all _ related problems of high complexity ( the tsp and the spin glass both fall into the _ np - hard _ class of computational complexity ) .",
    "showing that the ( replica symmetric ) cavity solution correctly predicts macroscopic quantities for the random link tsp would suggest that the tsp , unlike a spin glass , does indeed exhibit replica symmetry .    in order to obtain the cavity solution , consider the mean - field expression ( [ eq_zmf ] ) .",
    "taking advantage of nilpotency , as well as the fact that @xmath31 is non - negligible only with probability @xmath46 , we may expand ( [ eq_zmf ] ) and obtain in the large @xmath4 limit : @xmath57[1+({\\mathbf{h}}_k)^2/2]}\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differentiating @xmath58 with respect to @xmath55 and then setting @xmath59 yields an expression for @xmath43 in terms of the remaining @xmath48 , or equivalently in terms of the cavity magnetizations @xmath44 .",
    "this expression simplifies further simplifies at large @xmath28 . recalling that the magnetization is by construction directed along component 1",
    ", we obtain  @xcite : @xmath60 ( the factor @xmath28 in the denominator may be avoided , if need be , by applying a uniform rescaling factor @xmath61 to all magnetizations . ) thus , using the mean - field approach , we can express the magnetization of the @xmath42th spin in terms of what the other magnetizations would be in the _ absence _ of this @xmath42th spin .",
    "while these quantities have been derived for a spin system whose partition function is given by @xmath62 , we are interested in the tsp whose partition function is given by ( [ eq_ztsp ] ) .",
    "consider an important macroscopic quantity for the tsp : the frequency with which a tour occupies a given link .",
    "define @xmath63 to be @xmath64 if the link @xmath65 is in the tour , and @xmath66 otherwise . since the total tour length ( energy ) is @xmath67 , the _",
    "mean _ occupation frequency @xmath68 , averaged over all tours with the boltzmann factor , is simply found from the logarithmic derivative of ( [ eq_ztsp ] ) with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "using @xmath69 in place of @xmath70 , and proceeding as above , we obtain in the limit @xmath38 : @xmath71    the relations ( [ eq_recur1 ] ) and ( [ eq_recur2 ] ) have been derived for a single realization of the @xmath31 s . in the ensemble of instances we consider here ,",
    "the thermal averages become random variables with a particular distribution .",
    "as far as ( [ eq_recur1 ] ) is concerned , we may treat the magnetizations @xmath72 as independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a thermodynamic limit in the model requires that at large @xmath4 , @xmath73 have the _ same _ distribution as the cavity magnetizations ; this imposes , for a given link length distribution @xmath7 , a unique self - consistent probability distribution of the magnetizations . from ( [ eq_recur2 ] ) , one can then find the probability distribution of @xmath74 , and in turn , taking the @xmath75 limit , the distribution @xmath76 of link lengths @xmath77 used _ in the optimal tour _ ( at @xmath8 ) .",
    "krauth and mzard  @xcite carried out this calculation , for @xmath7 corresponding to that of the @xmath9-dimensional euclidean case , namely @xmath78 of course , @xmath79 must be cut off at some finite @xmath77 in order to be normalizable ; precisely how this is done is unimportant , however , since only the behavior of @xmath79 at small @xmath77 is relevant for the optimal tour in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "the result of krauth and mzard s calculation is : @xmath80 e^{-h_d(x ) } \\left [ 1+h_d(l - x))\\right ] e^{-h_d(l - x)}\\,dx\\mbox { , } \\label{eq_lldist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the solution to the integral equation @xmath82\\ , e^{-h_d(y)}\\,dy\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] from @xmath83 , one may obtain the mean link length in the tour , and thus the cavity prediction @xmath84 for the total length of the tour . introducing the large @xmath4 asymptotic quantity",
    "@xmath85 , the cavity prediction @xmath86 is then : @xmath87 e^{-h_d(x)}\\,dx\\mbox{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at @xmath88 , krauth and mzard solved these equations numerically , obtaining @xmath89 it is difficult to compare this with kirkpatrick s value of @xmath90 from direct simulations ( as no error estimate exists for the latter quantity ) , however an analysis @xcite of recent numerical results by johnson _",
    "@xcite gives @xmath91 , lending strong credence to the cavity value .",
    "krauth and mzard also performed a numerical study of @xmath92 .",
    "they found the cavity predictions to be in good agreement with what they found in their own direct simulations .",
    "further numerical evidence supporting the assumption of replica symmetry was found by sourlas @xcite , in an investigation of the low temperature statistical mechanics of the system .",
    "thus , for the @xmath0 distribution at @xmath88 , there is good reason to believe that the cavity assumptions are valid and that the resulting predictions are exact at large @xmath4 , so that @xmath93 .    at higher dimensions , the values of @xmath86 were given by the present authors in @xcite , and a large @xmath9 power series solution for @xmath86 was derived @xcite : @xmath94\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 represents euler s constant ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "but is the cavity method exact  that is , is @xmath97  for _ all _ @xmath9 , or is @xmath88 simply a pathological case ( as it is in the euclidean model , where @xmath98 ) ?",
    "while it appears sensible to argue that the qualitative properties of the random link tsp are insensitive to @xmath9 , there is as yet no evidence that replica symmetry holds for @xmath99 .",
    "our purpose here is to provide such evidence by numerical simulation , as has been done , for instance , in a related combinatorial optimization problem known as the matching problem @xcite .",
    "we now turn to this task , considering first the @xmath10 case , and then a `` renormalized '' random link model that enables us to verify numerically the @xmath100 coefficient predicted in ( [ eq_cavity ] ) .",
    "we have implicitly been making the assumption so far , via our notation , that as @xmath8 the random variable @xmath101 approaches a unique value @xmath102 with probability 1 . this is a property known as self - averaging .",
    "the analogous property has been shown for the euclidean tsp at all dimensions @xcite .",
    "for the random link tsp , however , the only case where a proof of self - averaging is known is in the @xmath12 limit , where a converging upper and lower bound give in fact the _ exact _ result @xcite : @xmath103\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] comparing this with ( [ eq_cavity ] ) , we may already see that @xmath104 when @xmath12 , and so the cavity prediction is correct in the infinite dimensional limit .    for finite @xmath9 , however , it has not been shown analytically that @xmath102 even exists . to some extent ,",
    "the difficulty in proving this can be traced to the non - satisfaction of the triangle inequality .",
    "the reader acquainted with the self - averaging proof for the euclidean tsp may see that the ideas used there are not applicable to the random link case ; for instance , combining good subtours using simple insertions will not lead to near - optimal global tours , making the problem particularly challenging .",
    "let us therefore examine the distribution of @xmath10 optimum tour lengths using numerical simulations , in order to give empirical support for the assertion that the @xmath8 limit is well - defined .",
    "the algorithmic procedures we use for simulations are identical to those we have used in an earlier study concerning the euclidean tsp @xcite ; for details , the interested reader is referred to that article . briefly stated , our optimization procedure involves using the lk and clo local search heuristic algorithms @xcite where for each instance of the ensemble we run the heuristic over multiple random starts .",
    "lk is used for smaller values of @xmath4 ( @xmath105 ) and clo , a more sophisticated method combining lk optimization with random jumps , for larger values of @xmath4 ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) .",
    "there is , of course , a certain probability that even over the course of multiple random starts , our heuristics will not find the true optimum of an instance .",
    "we estimate the associated systematic bias using a number of test instances , and adjust the number of random starts to keep this bias at least an order of magnitude below other sources of error discussed below .",
    "( at its maximum  occurring in the @xmath107 case  the systematic bias is estimated as under 1 part in 20,000 . )",
    ".variance of the non - rescaled optimum tour length @xmath108 with increasing @xmath4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     following this numerical method , we see from our simulations ( figure [ fig_rl_selfavd2 ] ) that the distribution of @xmath109 becomes increasingly sharply peaked for increasing @xmath4 , so that the ratio approaches a well - defined limit @xmath110 . furthermore , the variance of @xmath108 remains relatively constant in @xmath4 ( see table [ table_rl_vard2 ] ) , indicating that the width @xmath111 for the distribution shown in the figure decreases as @xmath112 , strongly suggesting a gaussian distribution .",
    "similar results were found in our euclidean study ( albeit in that case with @xmath111 being approximately half of its random link value ) .",
    "this is precisely the sort of behavior one would expect were the central limit theorem to be applicable .",
    "let us now consider the large @xmath4 limit of @xmath109 , as given by numerical simulations . in the euclidean case , it has been observed @xcite that the finite size scaling law can be written in terms of a power series in @xmath113 .",
    "the same arguments given there apply to the random link case , and so we may expect the ensemble average @xmath114 to satisfy @xmath115\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] in order to obtain @xmath114 at a finite value of @xmath4 from simulations , we average over a large number of instances to reduce the statistical error arising from instance - to - instance fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig_rl_fssd2 ] shows the results of this , with accompanying error bars , fitted to the expected finite size scaling law ( truncated after @xmath116 ) .",
    "the fit is a good one : @xmath117 for 5 degrees of freedom .",
    "as in @xcite , we may obtain an error estimate on @xmath110 by noting that if we take the extrapolated value and add or subtract one standard deviation , and then redo the fit with this as a fixed constant , @xmath118 will increase by 1 .",
    "we thus find @xmath119 , in very good agreement with the cavity result of @xmath120 the discrepancy between the two is consistent with the statistical error ( two standard deviations apart ) , and in relative terms is approximately @xmath121 .",
    "the fit in figure [ fig_rl_fssd2 ] , furthermore , appears robust with respect to sub - samples of the data ; even if we disallow the use of the @xmath107 data point in the fit , the resulting asymptotic value is still within @xmath122 of the cavity prediction . by comparison , recall that the error in the replica symmetric solution to the sk spin glass ground state energy is of the order of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "another quantity that krauth and mzard studied in their @xmath88 numerical investigation @xcite was the optimum tour link length distribution @xmath83 given in ( [ eq_lldist ] ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath123 , and following their example , let us look specifically at the integrated distribution @xmath124 .",
    "the cavity result for @xmath125 can , like @xmath102 , be computed numerically to arbitrary precision . in figure [ fig_rl_distscale ]",
    "we compare this with the results of direct simulations , for @xmath10 , at increasing values of @xmath4 .",
    "the improving agreement for increasing @xmath4 ( within 2% at @xmath107 ) strongly suggests that the cavity solution gives the exact @xmath8 result .    finally , it is of interest to consider one further quantity in the @xmath10 random link simulations , for which there is at present no corresponding cavity prediction : the frequencies of `` neighborhood rank '' used in the optimal tour , that is , the proportion of links connecting nearest neighbors , 2nd - nearest neighbors , etc .",
    "sourlas @xcite has noted that in practice in the @xmath88 case , this frequency falls off rapidly with increasing neighborhood rank  suggesting that optimization heuristics could be improved by preferentially choosing links between very near neighbors .",
    "our simulations show ( see figure [ fig_rl_neighbord2 ] ) that for @xmath10 the decrease is astonishingly close to exponential .",
    "we may offer the following qualitative explanation for this behavior .",
    "an optimal tour will always try to use links to the closest neighbors possible . while the constraint of a closed loop may force it in rare cases to use neighbors of high rank",
    ", this will apply only to a very small number of links in the tour .",
    "connecting a point to , say , its @xmath3th - nearest neighbor will for the most part be profitable only when this neighbor is not much further away than the @xmath126 nearer neighbors .",
    "in other words , the lengths from the point to its @xmath3 closest neighbors would have to be nearly degenerate . since a @xmath3-fold degeneracy of this sort is the product of @xmath126 unlikely events , it is in fact quite natural that the probability of such an occurrence is exponentially small in @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the neighborhood frequency function will fall exponentially in @xmath3 at large @xmath3 .",
    "we expect this behavior to hold in _ any _ dimension , and for that matter , in the euclidean tsp as well .",
    "similar and even stronger numerical results have been reported @xcite in another link - based combinatorial optimization problem , the matching problem .",
    "an analytical calculation of the neighborhood frequency may indeed turn out to be feasible using the cavity approach , thus providing a theoretical prediction to accompany our conjecture .",
    "we consider this a significant open question .",
    "in this section we will consider a different sort of random link tsp , proposed in @xcite , allowing us to test numerically the @xmath127 coefficient predicted by the cavity result ( [ eq_cavity ] ) .",
    "the approach involves introducing a mapping that shifts and rescales all the lengths between cities . by taking the limit @xmath12 ,",
    "one obtains a @xmath9-independent random link model having an exponential distribution for its link lengths .",
    "this `` renormalized '' model was outlined in @xcite ; we present it here in further detail .",
    "we then perform a numerical study of the model , which enables us to determine the large @xmath9 behavior of the standard @xmath9-dimensional random link model .",
    "let us define @xmath128 to be the distance between a city and its nearest neighbor , averaged over all cities in the instance and over all instances in the ensemble .",

    "it is not surprising that this quantity is reminiscent of ( [ eq_rlexact ] ) , since @xmath130 represents precisely a lower bound on @xmath102 .    in order to obtain the renormalized model ,",
    "consider a link length transformation making use of @xmath128 .",
    "for any instance with link lengths @xmath0 ( taken to have the usual distribution ( [ eq_dist ] ) corresponding to @xmath9 dimensions ) , define new link lengths @xmath131 / \\langle d_1(n , d)\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the @xmath132 are `` lengths '' only in the loosest sense , as they can be both positive and negative . the optimal tour in the @xmath132 model will , however , follow the same `` path '' as the optimal tour in the associated @xmath0 model , since the transformation is linear .",

    "this results in a somewhat peculiar random link tsp , no longer containing the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "its link length distribution is given by the @xmath12 limit of ( [ eq_rndist ] ) , @xmath143 and its optimum tour length satisfies @xmath144 where we have dropped the @xmath9 argument from these ( now @xmath9-independent ) quantities . by performing direct simulations using the distribution ( [ eq_rndef1 ] )",
    " cut off beyond a threshold value of @xmath145 , as was done for @xmath79  we may find the value of @xmath146 numerically .",
    "finally , let us relate this renormalized model to the standard @xmath9-dimensional random link model . in light of ( [ eq_rndef2 ] )",
    ", we may rewrite ( [ eq_rnbeta1 ] ) and obtain the result given in @xcite : @xmath147\\mbox{. } \\label{eq_rnbeta2}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath146 in the renormalized model therefore gives directly the @xmath127 coefficient for the ( non - renormalized ) @xmath102 .",
    "we now carry out these direct simulations for the renormalized model . figures [ fig_rl_selfavrn ] and [ fig_rl_fssrn ] show our numerical results . in figure",
    "[ fig_rl_selfavrn ] , we see that just as in the @xmath10 case , the distribution of the optimum tour length becomes sharply peaked at large @xmath4 and the asymptotic limit @xmath146 is well - defined . via ( [ eq_rnbeta2 ] ) , this provides very good reason for believing that @xmath102 is well - defined _ for all _ @xmath9 , and that self - averaging holds for the random link tsp in general . in figure",
    "[ fig_rl_fssrn ] , we show the finite size scaling of @xmath148 .",
    "the fit is again quite satisfactory ( with @xmath118=5.23 for 5 degrees of freedom ) , giving the asymptotic result @xmath149 .",
    "the resulting value for the @xmath127 coefficient in @xmath102 is then @xmath150 , in excellent agreement ( error under @xmath151 ) with the cavity prediction @xmath152 given in ( [ eq_cavity ] ) .",
    "again , as in the @xmath10 case , let us briefly consider the frequencies of @xmath3th - nearest neighbors used in optimal tours .",
    "these frequencies are given in figure [ fig_rl_neighborrn ] for the renormalized model .",
    "even though the exponential fit is not as good as in the @xmath10 case , it is still striking here .",
    "what does this tell us , in turn , about the standard random link tsp ? recall that the renormalized model arises from the @xmath12 limit of the @xmath9-dimensional ( non - renormalized ) model , and that the mapping ( [ eq_lx_lrl ] ) preserves the optimum tour for any given instance .",
    "these @xmath3th - neighbor frequency results are thus the @xmath12 limiting frequencies for the @xmath9-dimensional random link tsp ( and most likely for the euclidean tsp also ) .",
    "this gives further support to our conjecture that the exponential law holds for all @xmath9 , and suggests as a consequence that the `` typical '' neighborhood rank @xmath3 used in optimal tours remains bounded for all @xmath9 .",
    "the random link tsp has interested theoreticians primarily because of its analytical tractability , allowing presumably exact results that are not possible in the more traditional euclidean tsp .",
    "other than in the @xmath88 case , however , it has attracted little attention . in this paper",
    "we have provided a numerical study of the random link tsp that was lacking up to this point , addressing important unanswered questions . through simulations",
    ", we have tested the validity of the theoretical predictions derived using the cavity method . while in other disordered systems , such as spin glasses ,",
    "the replica symmetric solution gives values of macroscopic quantities that are inexact ( typically by several percent ) , in the random link tsp it shows all signs of being exact .",
    "we have studied various link - based quantities at @xmath10 and found that the numerical results confirm the cavity predictions to within @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed , by way of simulations on a renormalized random link model , that the analytical cavity solution gives a large @xmath9 expansion for the optimum tour length whose @xmath127 coefficient is correct to within well under @xmath153 .",
    "the excellent agreement found at @xmath88 @xcite , @xmath10 , and to @xmath100 at large @xmath9 , then suggest strongly that the cavity predictions are exact .",
    "this provides indirect evidence that the assumption of replica symmetry  on which the cavity calculation is based  is indeed justified for the tsp .",
    "finally , our random link simulations have pointed to a surprising numerical result .",
    "if one considers the links in optimal tours as links between @xmath3th - nearest neighbors , at @xmath10 the frequency with which the tour uses neighborhoods of rank @xmath3 decreases with @xmath3 as almost a perfect exponential .",
    "encouraged by similar results in the renormalized model , we conjecture that this property holds true for all @xmath9 , as well as in the euclidean tsp .",
    "as no theoretical calculation presently explains the phenomenon , we would welcome further investigation along these lines .",
