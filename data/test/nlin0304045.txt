    "during the past twenty years there has been increasing interest in the study of the coexisting regular and chaotic motions in hamiltonian systems with few degrees of freedom .",
    "a basic problem of study was the transition to chaos in two degrees of freedom hamiltonian systems which are slight perturbations of an integrable system , whose hamiltonian is nondegenerate . in order to ease this task ,",
    "most of the results on the dynamics of such hamiltonian systems were obtained exploring the behaviour of a poincar map associated to a cross section in a fixed energy surface .",
    "a poincar map is an area preserving map ( apm ) defined on an annulus , that is , depending on @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a momentum  like coordinate and @xmath2 is an angular variable .",
    "considering the lift of such a map , namely computing the angle without the restriction modulo @xmath3 , one associates to an orbit @xmath4 the rotation number which is the limit :    @xmath5    if it exists .",
    "if @xmath6 is an irrational number , then the orbit densely fills an invariant circle ( kam circle ) , while an orbit of rational rotation number @xmath7  with @xmath8 coprime integers , @xmath9  is a @xmath10periodic orbit",
    ".    typical questions of mathematical and physical interest include the persistence of the kam circles after perturbation and determination of the threshold at which a circle of a given rotation number breaks up .",
    "the main results which answer these questions , such as the kam theorem , the poincar  birkhoff theorem , and the moser twist theorem , are based on the validity of the twist property of the area preserving map transforming @xmath11 , namely :    @xmath12    the twist condition implies the monotonic change of the rotation number @xmath6 with @xmath1 .",
    "the apm satisfying this condition is called monotonic twist map or simply a twist map . during the last twenty years",
    "the monotonic twist apms were studied extensively @xcite .",
    "consequently , their dynamics has gained almost complete understanding .",
    "in particular , this statement is a consequence of the late understanding that hamiltonian systems have universal behaviour which can be revealed by studying explicit symplectic maps of the plane .",
    "recently , due to the increasing number of physical phenomena that are modeled by nontwist maps , this class of dynamical systems has finally captured the attention of the scientific community .",
    "the few studies on nontwist maps existent in the literature have revealed an unexpected variety of local and global bifurcations : dimerized island chains , periodic orbits collision , separatrix reconnection , vortex islands @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the poincar map associated to a periodic perturbation , both in space and in time , of a linear hamiltonian system .",
    "the dynamical system originates from a model of stellar pulsations previously introduced in @xcite for low mass stars ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the solar mass ) and extended to intermediate mass stars ( @xmath15 $ ] ) in @xcite .",
    "the latter work included some preliminary results concerning the nontwist character of the map . here",
    ", we show that this map is an apm with an oscillating rotation number function . in spite of the system being a perturbation of a linear hamiltonian ,",
    "we argue that due to both the acquired nontwist character and the periodic character of the perturbation , the map presents the typical features of a generic class of nontwist apms , such as reconnection and meandering , with the nongeneric scenario of creation of vortices .",
    "the nonmonotonic property due to the triplication bifurcation is shown to be different from that exhibited by the cubic hnon map , which can be considered as the prototype of apms , and which undergoes a triplication followed by the twistless bifurcation .",
    "our study exploits the reversibility property of the initial system , which induces the time - reversal symmetry of the poincar map .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce our model of stellar pulsations . before getting into the detailed analysis of it ,",
    "we consider worth recalling the most important features of nontwist maps .",
    "this is done in  3 . in this section",
    "we will also emphasize the consequences of both the triplication bifurcation and of the symmetry properties .",
    "later , in  4 we study the dynamics of our simple model of stellar pulsations . finally in section 5 we summarize our major findings and we draw our conclusions .",
    "pulsating stars are perfect tests of the theory of stellar evolution since the comparison between the theoretical pulsational characteristics ( periods , amplitudes , and growth time scales ) and the observed ones can help substantially in the fine tuning of the stellar models .",
    "low- and intermediate - mass stars are prone to experience recurrent thermal instabilities and substantial mass loss during certain intervals of their evolution .",
    "moreover , a substantial amount of pulsating stars in the galaxy shows irregular behaviour and this makes them interesting targets in the field of dynamics systems .",
    "the present model embodies the essential of stellar oscillations by assuming an oscillatory driving originating in the stellar interior in the form of sinusoidal pressure waves .",
    "this model belongs to the family of the so - called one - zone models which treat the star as a rigid core surrounded by a dynamic , homogeneous gas shell .",
    "the pressure waves propagate through a transition zone characterized by a certain transmission coefficient until they hit the stellar envelope and dissipate .",
    "no back reaction of the outer layers on the inner ones is considered .",
    "the dissipation of the pressure waves induces a fluctuation in the radius and velocity of the outermost layer and this variability makes the object of our study .",
    "the variation of the interior radius , @xmath16 , around an equilibrium value , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the time in years and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fractional amplitude and the frequency of the driving , respectively .",
    "in absence of any driving force , the equation of motion is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the stellar mass and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radius and pressure in the shell of mass @xmath26 , respectively . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce the nondimensional variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the equilibrium stellar radius and    @xmath30 is the characteristic frequency of the star .    considering that the additional perturbative acceleration is proportional to the driving acceleration with a proportionality coefficient @xmath31",
    "we obtain    @xmath32    and after some algebraic manipulation @xcite the final equation of motion reads    @xmath33    where the characteristic frequency of the system , @xmath34 results from the use of the dimensionless time unit and from the assumption that @xmath17 encompasses almost the entire stellar mass .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath35    in the action - angle coordinates @xmath0 resulting from the change @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath38    the parameters of the system are @xmath39 , the total driving amplitude , @xmath20 , the fractional driving amplitude and @xmath34 , the characteristic frequency of the system . from the point of view of the parametric study , we take @xmath34 to be the most important parameter fixing the type of star to be studied and its evolutionary status . it is a measure of the ratio between the internal radius where the driving is produced and the equilibrium stellar radius . from the astrophysical perspective , we are interested in the dynamics of the system from eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath40 , more exactly @xmath41 .",
    "this low value of @xmath34 is associated with evolved stages of intermediate mass stars , as it results from stellar evolutionary models @xcite . since we are interested in modeling the evolution of this type of stars , we fix @xmath34 during our simulations .",
    "we have performed a thorough parametric study in the space ( @xmath39,@xmath20 ) as it assures a fine tuning of the strength of the perturbation . as in @xcite ,",
    "we are interested in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which allow the perturbative approach .",
    "the prototype of nontwist area preserving maps is the quadratic standard map @xcite :    @xmath44    the twist condition is violated along the curve @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    "we get an integrable map , whose orbits lie on the circles of constant @xmath1 .",
    "the rotation number function is @xmath47 .",
    "the circle @xmath48 has the maximum rotation number @xmath49 .",
    "it is called the twistless circle or shearless circle .",
    "a slight perturbation leads to the persistence of the twistless circle and nearby circles having a diophantine rotation number  that is , an irrational number badly approximated by rationals @xcite .",
    "hence , the nontwist standard map , defined above , has an invariant circle of maximum rotation number among the rotation numbers of the nearby orbits . for a fixed perturbation parameter @xmath50 and for @xmath34",
    "chosen in such a way that the map has a pair of poincar  birkhoff chains containing @xmath7-type periodic orbits , as @xmath34 varies the two chains approach each other and at a threshold @xmath51 the hyperbolic points of the two chains enter the twistless circle .",
    "this is called the reconnection threshold @xcite . at the reconnection",
    "threshold the two distinct hyperbolic orbits , of rotation number @xmath7 , are connected by heteroclinic arcs .",
    "there are many ways in which the monotonic twist condition can be violated .",
    "the vertical lines @xmath52 can be mapped into curves having a single extremum  quadratic twist @xcite  or multiple extrema  cubic @xcite , quartic @xcite or sinusoidal twist @xcite . moreover , it has been proved @xcite that whenever the elliptic fixed point of an apm of the plane passes through a triplication , a twistless bifurcation occurs or , equivalently , the rotation number as a function of the distance from the elliptic fixed point becomes a nonmonotonic function .",
    "the triplication of the elliptic fixed point of an apm @xmath53 of the plane , occurs at the value @xmath54 at which the multipliers of the elliptic point cross the values @xmath55 . at the triplication threshold",
    "@xmath56 an unstable period3 orbit emerges from the elliptic fixed point in both directions , that is for @xmath57 and for @xmath58 . as @xmath59 increases the elliptic point crosses the @xmath60 resonance and the triangular shape figure changes side after shrinking to elliptic fixed point ( figure [ tripl ] ) .",
    "the symmetry properties are very useful for the explanation of the behaviour exhibited by the system under study .",
    "we next recall some notions and results concerning time  reversal symmetry of a dynamical system @xcite .",
    "a system of differential equations    @xmath61    or equivalently , the vector field @xmath62 is called reversible if there is a smooth involution @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) such that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the differential of the map @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath24 is called the reversor of the vector field @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath67 is the flow of the vector field @xmath62 , then the reversibility means that @xmath68 .",
    "this is tantamount to say that the reflection of the trajectory @xmath69 is also an orbit of the system .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath70 is called reversible with respect to a smooth involution @xmath24 of @xmath71 if @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath73 is an @xmath24-reversible diffeomorphism then @xmath74 is also an involution @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "this factorization of the map @xmath73 is very useful for the study of its dynamical properties .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath77 is a @xmath24-reversible map , too , @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath81 are called symmetry lines of the map @xmath73 .",
    "a point in the intersection @xmath83 is a periodic point of the map @xmath73 , whose period divides @xmath84 .",
    "the symmetry lines @xmath85 are transformed by @xmath77 into other symmetry lines in the following way :    @xmath86    in order to interpret the nontwist  type dynamics which will be encountered in our system when studying the triplication of the elliptic fixed point , we consider necessary to illustrate the twistless bifurcation in the case of the cubic hnon map    @xmath87    which has an elliptic fixed point @xmath88 that can be easily found . at @xmath89",
    "this point undergoes a triplication , while at @xmath90 the saddle center collision occurs . in figure [ hentripl ] , we show that as @xmath59 increases beyond @xmath91 , the elliptic and hyperbolic period-3 orbits collide and disappear in a saddle ",
    "center bifurcation at @xmath92 .",
    "in order to better identify the twistless bifurcation  the birth of a twistless circle  in figure [ henrot1 ] we show the rotation number @xmath93 as a function of the points @xmath94 lying on the symmetry line @xmath95 of the cubic hnon map , which is a reversible map with respect to the reversor @xmath96 .",
    "more precisely , the rotation number is computed at the points @xmath97 and satisfying @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ henrot1 ] shows that between the triplication threshold and saddle  center collision threshold of the two period3 orbits , the twistless circle is the circle of rotation number @xmath99 ( the maximum points from right to left correspond to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ) .",
    "observe that as @xmath59 increases up to @xmath103 , the twistless circle moves away from the elliptic fixed point .",
    "much more important ( and difficult ) is to detect the location of the twistless circle after the collision  annihilation of the two period3 orbits . in order to get some insight into the manifestation of the twist propertiy beyond the threshold @xmath104 , we have computed numerically the rotation numbers for points starting near the elliptic fixed point of the cubic hnon map and on the symmetry line @xmath105 .",
    "the rotation number functions @xmath93 are plotted for @xmath106 , and some parameter values obtained varying @xmath59 in the direction given by the vector @xmath107 ( figure [ henrot2 ] ) . note that the cubic hnon map has a twistless circle of maximum rotation number among the rotation numbers of nearby orbits .",
    "varying the parameter @xmath59 as specified above , @xmath108 decreases as a result of the collision  annihilation of the orbits @xcite , and at some value , @xmath109 , the rotation number becomes decreasing . at this point",
    "the map is no longer nontwist .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath110 was called the threshold of the twistless bifurcation in @xcite where the above presented scenario was first presented although in the reverse order .",
    "due to the the complexity of the perturbative term of the hamiltonian of eq.([eq : ham ] ) , the associated system in eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) is analytically intractable . in order to get some insight into its dynamical behaviour , we study the poincar map ( in fact the stroboscopic map ) associated to this time - periodic hamiltonian system .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath111 is globally degenerate , which means that @xmath112 .",
    "the dynamical consequence of this degeneracy is that all the orbits are periodic having the same period .",
    "this is in contrast to kam theory , where the unperturbed system is nondegenerate .",
    "we will show that after a periodic perturbation ( periodic in time and in space ) the corresponding poincar map exhibits local and global bifurcations which in some cases are typical of the class of nontwist apms which are perturbations of locally degenerate integrable apms of an annulus , while in other cases are not .",
    "since the system given in eq.([eq : motion2 ] ) is time - periodic of period @xmath113 , we define the function @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the circle identified with the interval @xmath117 . hence , we have the autonomous system of differential equations :    @xmath118    we denote by @xmath119 its flow .",

    "the plane    @xmath124    is transversal to the flow and the map @xmath125 defined by @xmath126 is the associated poincar map .",
    "it is a classical result in dynamical systems theory that the poincar map associated to a one degree of freedom periodic time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian system is an apm . in order to interpret the dynamics displayed by the numerically computed poincar map ,",
    "let us deduce some geometrical properties of this map .",
    "the vector field @xmath62 , associated to the system from eq.([eq : motionf ] ) ,    @xmath127    with ( @xmath128 ) , is reversible with respect to the involution @xmath129 , @xmath130 , that is :    @xmath131    the reversibility property ( [ revvf ] ) is equivalent to @xmath132 , @xmath133 , which means that @xmath134 the diffeomorphism @xmath119 is @xmath135reversible , because @xmath136 .",

    "note that if the elliptic orbits of one chain of vortices intersect @xmath168 , then the next one , which is created external to it , has a pair of elliptic points on the symmetry line @xmath188 .",
    "the invariant rotational circle interpolating the hyperbolic points of the chain of vortices is the twistless circle . in figure [ vortices2 ]",
    "it can be seen that such circles pass almost through the extremum of the symmetry lines @xmath181 . as already said ,",
    "the formation of vortices is not generic and therefore the twistless circle that appears between them is not either .",
    "our system is a clear example of weak chaos , where the perturbation itself creates a separatrix network at a certain @xmath189 ( the dimerized island chains and the vortices chains ) and then destroys it as @xmath39 increases by producing regions of chaotic dynamics .",
    "the case of strong chaos implies that the unperturbed hamiltonian intrinsically has separatrix structures and the perturbation just clothes them in thin stochastic layers . in both cases ,",
    "the merging of the stochastic layers in the phase space may give rise to a single chaotic network called stochastic web .",
    "the larger @xmath39 is , the wider is the stochastic web .",
    "inside the cells of the web , there exists a set of islands of regular motion called invariant web - tori @xcite whose dimensions are inversely proportional to the perturbation strength : for strong perturbations , they are engulfed by the stochastic sea . our system presents this kind of behaviour , which is presented in figure [ chaotic ] .",
    "it has long been known ( and not yet well understood ) that the boundaries of the islands of regular motion can be `` sticky '' , meaning that chaotic orbits can spend a long time close to the islands and then escape in the chaotic sea .",
    "this phenomenon was observed already in @xcite and was later called _ stickiness _ @xcite . in general , it can be explained by the transformation of the web - tori into web - cantori as the perturbation is increased .",
    "contrary to the absolute barriers constituted by the invariant tori , the cantori are only temporary barriers .",
    "that is , the orbits close to the main islands can reach the chaotic sea when they encounter the gaps in the cantori , which happens after an indefinite time interval .",
    "recent works @xcite also suggest that the stickiness is due to the formation of higher - order resonant islands in the transition region between the main island and the chaotic sea ( figure [ particular ] ) .",
    "the presence of these so - called _ dynamical traps _ appears to be generic for hamiltonian systems and therefore their existence critically determines the large - timescale behaviour of such systems . in this context , a behaviour extremely similar to sticky orbits has been shown to result from simulations of stellar variability using full hydrodynamical codes carried on significantly long time - intervals . in the absence of a better explanation ,",
    "it was attributed to long - term ( secular ) nonlinear effects in the stellar envelopes . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we have shown that our simple model recovers such a behaviour as it is generic of hamiltonian systems .",
    "we also presented clear examples of sticky orbits together with an extensive discussion of their implications in the framework of the classification of variable stars .",
    "therefore , we mention here only the fact that if a hamiltonian approach is intrinsic to the phenomenon of stellar variability , we can expect that different categories of variable stars ( classified according to their amplitude , frequency , irregularity ) may be viewed under a more unifying perspective than it is presently considered .",
    "moreover , considering that the sporadic excursions of the sticky orbits to the chaotic sea translate into high velocities of the outer layers , mass loss is very likely to occur , again in accordance with the observations .",
    "another important and distinctive feature of the phase portrait of nontwist maps is the existence of _ meanders _ , as it was mentioned before when discussing figure [ dimerized]_d_. meanders are created between two successively born dimerized island chains or between two chains of vortices . in nontwist standard  like maps they become usual invariant curves after the reconnection of the two chains . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we illustrate next the relationship between the meanders and the reconnection process for our map . in figure",
    "[ meander ] we show the creation of meanders from the reconnection of the poincar - birkhoff chains of period 34 . in the case of the standard nontwist map @xcite , in the reconnection of poincar - birkhoff chains of even periodic orbits , periodic points of the chains having the same stability type are aligned in phase . in other words , to an elliptic ( hyperbolic ) point of one chain corresponds below or above also an elliptic ( hyperbolic ) point . due to this alignment , the reconnection is nongeneric and corresponds to a hyperbolic - hyperbolic collision leading to the formation of vortices . in our case ,",
    "the two poincare - birkhoff chains of even period ( period 34 ) have periodic points of opposite stability type which approach each other in their way to reconnection ( figure [ meander]_a _ ) .",
    "therefore , the reconnection is generic and in the subsequent dimerized islands chains , hyperbolic - elliptic collision occurs .",
    "moreover , after the reconnection , the twistless circle turns from a graph of a function of the angular variable to a meander ( figure [ meander]_b _ ) .",
    "this meander is slightly visible in figure [ chaotic]_b_.    meanders appear to be robust invariant circles acting also as separatrices between distinct regions of chaotic dynamics . for stronger perturbations",
    ", their destruction allows the chaotic orbits to reach other stochastic regions previously separated by the meander .",
    "this behaviour was observed in nontwist standard - like maps @xcite , but until now there is no explanation for this robustness .",
    "in the present work we have extended the preliminary results of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the dynamics of a forced oscillator as a model of irregular stellar pulsations .",
    "the driving is characterized by two parameters , the fractional amplitude of the internal perturbation @xmath20 and the total amplitude of the driving @xmath39 .",
    "our aim was to undertake a more detailed analysis of the transition to the nontwist property in the associated poincar map .",
    "we have demonstrated that for a given @xmath190 there exists an @xmath159 that corresponds to a triplication of the central elliptic fixed point of the map . as we were interested in values of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath39 above the triplication curve , the nontwist character of the map was undoubtly present @xcite .",
    "special attention was devoted to the process of formation of periodic orbits and to periodic - orbits collision .",
    "the reversibility of the poincar map and consequently , the symmetry properties allowed a clear identification of the structure of the periodic points .",
    "more precisely , the evolution and the intersections of the symmetry lines of the system provided good tracers of the steps of creation of dimerized island chains and vortex chains .",
    "we strongly argued in favor of these particularities of the map being entirely due to the superposition of two factors : the nonmonotonicity of the rotation number function induced by the triplication of the elliptic fixed point and the nonmonotonicity of the same function due to the oscillating perturbation .",
    "the latter feature admits alternative occurrence of maxima and minima , where the twist condition is violated .",
    "this translates into the minima and maxima of the symmetry lines which transform the invariant curves passing through them into twistless circles . using these elements ,",
    "we have followed the local and global bifurcations until the formation of stochastic layers around separatrices together with the associated sticky orbits .",
    "we have proved that the reconnection of even periodic orbits is generic by following the reconnection of two poincar - birkhoff chains of period 34 . from the astrophysical point of view",
    ", we have dwelled on the implications of the sticky regions and of the interplay between stochastic and regular regions in the framework of the analysis of stellar variability . in order to provide quantitative characterization of sticky orbits in the framework of stellar variability",
    ", we shall concentrate in the future on the causes and probabilistic estimates of the stickiness mechanism .",
