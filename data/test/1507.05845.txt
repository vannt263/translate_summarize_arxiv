    "the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair )  @xcite is currently being constructed as an expansion of the gsi helmholtz centre in darmstadt , germany .",
    "panda  @xcite is one of the four major experiments at fair and will be located at the high energy storage ring ( hesr )",
    ". cooled beams of antiprotons with high luminosity up to @xmath2 and high resolution ( @xmath3 ) in the momentum range of 1.5gev / c to 15gev / c will be used for panda to perform high precision experiments in the strange and charm quark sector .",
    "the panda detector is divided into two magnetic spectrometers , allowing almost 4@xmath4 angular coverage .",
    "charged particle identification within the target spectrometer is done by cherenkov detectors based on the dirc principle and a fast timing detector in combination with the tracking system .",
    "the design of the panda barrel time - of - flight ( tof ) detector is motivated by physical as well as technical considerations .",
    "the main tasks of the system are particle identification for slow charged particles ( @xmath5 ) below the momentum threshold of the dirc detector , precise determination of the time origin of particle tracks to disentagle subsequent events at high collision rates of n@xmath6 , relative time - of - flight measurements together with the forward tof system and charge discrimination as well as photon conversion detection in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "the major requirements are a minimum use of material less than 2% of a radiation length , a time resolution of @xmath0 and a large solid angle coverage of 22@xmath7 .",
    "the barrel tof detector is located in between the dirc detector and the emc at a radial distance of about 50 cm from the beam pipe .",
    "the extremely limited space of only 2 cm in radial direction demands a lightweight and compact detector design as it has been proposed in ref .",
    "the suggested layout foresees a scintillator tile ( scitil ) hodoscope composed of 5760 small plastic scintillator tiles with sizes of about @xmath8 , covering a total area of about 5.2m@xmath9 .",
    "the tiles are attached to silicon photomultipliers ( sipms ) .",
    "plastic scintillators provide fast response and high light yield while sipms offer good timing , high photon detection efficiency , compactness and insensitivity to the magnetic field of about 2 t within the panda target spectrometer .",
    "in order to fulfill the requirements for the scitil detector , extensive optimization studies have been performed by monte carlo simulation and experiment .",
    "results of these studies are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . to finally prove the feasibility of reaching a time resolution of @xmath0 with the proposed detector ,",
    "a scitil prototype based on the optimization studies has been tested in a 2.7 gev / c proton beam at forschungszentrum jlich .",
    "the beam intensity was adjusted to 10@xmath10-@xmath11hz and the beam size was approximately @xmath12 .",
    "the detector consisted of two plastic scintillator tiles read - out with sipms from two opposing sides mounted in a light - tight aluminum box .",
    "the sipms were coupled to the scintillators using bc-630 optical grease to maximize the light collection .",
    "we considered plastic scintillators from eljen and analog sipms with @xmath1 sensitive area from ketek and hamamatsu , respectively , as well as the digital photon counter ( dpc ) from philips with an active area of about @xmath13 divided into @xmath14 individual die sensors .",
    "the analog sipm signals were amplified using amp-0604 preamplifiers from photonique .",
    "finally , the waveforms were digitized with a caen v1742 waveform digitizer ( 5 gs / s ) and stored for offline data analysis .",
    "a time walk correction using pulse height information was applied . in case of the dpc",
    "the electronics are already integrated inside the detector , providing digital energy and time information .        in the test beam experiment we observed that the scintillator tiles read - out with ketek sipms show in general slightly better time resolution than the tiles attached to sensors from hamamatsu .",
    "[ fig : resultsketek ] shows the obtained results on the time resolution using different types of sipms from ketek . except for the pm3360ts type in combination with an ej-228 scintillator",
    "all configurations show a time resolution @xmath0 . the best value that could be achieved is @xmath15 with pm3360ts sensors attached to an ej-232 plastic scintillator .",
    "one can realize that the tile time resolution strongly depends on the over - voltage of the photodetectors . increasing the bias voltage leads to improved time resolution but at the same time increases the influence of dark - noise , cross - talk and after - pulses , which at some point deteriorate the timing performance .",
    "the same trend could be observed when employing hamamatsu photodetectors . in this case",
    "a time resolution of @xmath16 was reached with the s12572 - 025c type attached to an ej-228 scintillator . using",
    "an ej-232 material showed a nearly identical result .    .",
    "the time resolution was determined by using single die time stamps or an average of multiple time stamps . ]",
    "employing the large - area dpc allowed to cover a larger fraction of the scintillator surface .",
    "this led to an increased number of detected photons and a multitude of available trigger time stamps ( one per die ) .",
    "the time resolution of the tile can either be estimated by using single time stamps or an average of multiple die time stamps . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : resultsdpc ] , a multiple time stamp approach provides a more accurate estimation and leads to improved time resolution , as expected . to perform this analysis",
    "the individual die time stamps have been sorted in ascending order .",
    "the best result of @xmath17 could be achieved by using an average of the first five acquired time stamps .",
    "taking into account higher time stamp orders , i.e. late photons , does not provide valuable input for this method . in case of the single time stamp approach the first order ,",
    "i.e. the first detected photon , provided the best time precision , as expected from photon counting statistics  @xcite .",
    "experimental results have demonstrated that the envisaged time resolution of @xmath0 for the scitil detector is given with the proposed detector layout .",
    "highest time resolution could be achieved with the large - area dpc by making use of multiple time stamps , though conventional @xmath1 sipms also met the requirements .",
    "current effort is placed on the r&d of read - out electronics and further optimization of the scintillator geometry .",
    "we are currently investigating bar - shaped scintillator tiles up to a size of @xmath18 read - out from two sides by 3 - 4 sipms connected in series , as reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "with such a design the time resolution can further be improved .",
    "this work was partly supported by the eu project hadronphysics3 ( project 283286 ) .",
    "the authors also thank the team of philips digital photon counting ."
