    "according to the inflationary scenario , it is believed that a scalar field known as inflaton is responsible for a rapid accelerated expansion of the early universe @xcite . for",
    "the inflationary mechanism to work there must exist a weakly coupled scalar field which is initially at a false vacuum which leads to the inflation until the right vacuum value is obtained .",
    "this inflationary model solves the problem of flatness , isotropy of microwave background radiation and unwanted relics .",
    "contrary to the prediction of the standard cosmological models , recent observations showed an accelerated mode of expansion of the present day universe @xcite .",
    "though the existence of an inflationary scenario is not of much concern , the question of where the scalar field comes from and why it undergoes such a peculiar phase transition from false to right vacuum still remains unanswered .",
    "this leads cosmologists to reconsider alternative possibilities .",
    "as one of the way out many specialists considered spinor field as an alternative source . being related to almost all stable elementary particles such as proton , electron and neutrino , spinor field , especially dirac spin-@xmath0 play a principal role at the microlevel .",
    "however , in cosmology , the role of spinor field was generally considered to be restricted . only recently , after some remarkable works by different authors @xcite , showing the important role that spinor fields play on the evolution of the universe , the situation began to change .",
    "this change of attitude is directly related to some fundamental questions of modern cosmology : ( i ) problem of initial singularity ; ( ii ) problem of isotropization and ( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe .    *",
    "( i ) problem of initial singularity : * one of the problems of modern cosmology is the presence of initial singularity , which means the finiteness of time . the main purpose of introducing a nonlinear term in the spinor field lagrangian is to study the possibility of the elimination of initial singularity . in a number of papers",
    "@xcite it was shown that the introduction of spinor field with a suitable nonlinearity into the system indeed gives rise to singularity - free models of the universe .    *",
    "( ii ) problem of isotropization : * although the universe seems homogenous and isotropic at present , it does not necessarily mean that it is also suitable for a description of the early stages of the development of the universe and there are no observational data guaranteeing the isotropy in the era prior to the recombination .",
    "in fact , there are theoretical arguments that support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one @xcite .",
    "the observations from cosmic background explorer s differential radiometer have detected and measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies in different angular scales .",
    "these anisotropies are supposed to hide in their fold the entire history of cosmic evolution dating back to the recombination era and are being considered as indicative of the geometry and the content of the universe .",
    "more about cosmic microwave background anisotropy is expected to be uncovered by the investigations of microwave anisotropy probe .",
    "there is widespread consensus among the cosmologists that cosmic microwave background anisotropies in small angular scales have the key to the formation of discrete structure .",
    "it was found that the introduction of nonlinear spinor field accelerates the isotropization process of the initially anisotropic universe @xcite .    *",
    "( iii ) late time acceleration of the universe : * some recent experiments detected an accelerated mode of expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "detection and further experimental reconfirmation of current cosmic acceleration pose to cosmology a fundamental task of identifying and revealing the cause of such phenomenon .",
    "this fact can be reconciled with the theory if one assumes that the universe i d mostly filled with so - called dark energy .",
    "this form of matter ( energy ) is not observable in laboratory and it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation .",
    "these facts played decisive role in naming this object .",
    "in contrast to dark matter , dark energy is uniformly distributed over the space , does not intertwine under the influence of gravity in all scales and it has a strong negative pressure of the order of energy density .",
    "based on these properties , cosmologists have suggested a number of dark energy models those are able to explain the current accelerated phase of expansion of the universe . in this connection",
    "a series of papers appeared recently in the literature , where a spinor field was considered as an alternative model for dark energy @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that most of the works mentioned above were carried out within the scope of bianchi type - i cosmological model .",
    "results obtained using a spinor field as a source of bianchi type - i cosmological field can be summed up as follows : a suitable choice of spinor field nonlinearity + ( i ) _ accelerates the isotropization process _ @xcite ; + ( ii ) _ gives rise to a singularity - free universe _",
    "@xcite ; + ( iii ) _ generates late time acceleration _ @xcite .    given the role that spinor field can play in the evolution of the universe , question that naturally pops up is , if the spinor field can redraw the picture of evolution caused by perfect fluid and dark energy , is it possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a spinor field ?",
    "affirmative answer to this question was given in the a number of papers @xcite .",
    "in those papers spinor description of matter such as perfect fluid and dark energy was given and the evolution of the universe given by different bianchi models was thoroughly studied . in almost all the papers",
    "the spinor field was considered to be time - dependent functions and its energy - momentum tensor was given by the diagonal elements only .",
    "some latest study shows that due to the specific connection with gravitational field the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field possesses non - trivial non - diagonal components as well . in this paper",
    "we study the role of non - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor of the spinor field in the evolution of the universe . to our knowledge",
    "such study was never done previously . in section",
    "ii we give the spinor field lagrangian in details . in section",
    "iii the system of einstein - dirac equations is solved for bi metric without engaging the non - diagonal components of energy - momentum tensor as it was done in previous works of many authors . in section",
    "iv we analyze the role of non - diagonal components of energy - momentum tensor on the evolution of the universe .",
    "for a spinor field @xmath1 , the symmetry between @xmath1 and @xmath2 appears to demand that one should choose the symmetrized lagrangian @xcite . keeping this in mind we choose the spinor field lagrangian as @xcite : @xmath3 - m_{\\rm sp } { \\bar \\psi}\\psi - f , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear term @xmath4 describes the self - interaction of a spinor field and",
