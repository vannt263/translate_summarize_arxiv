    "one of the methods for studying extensive air showers of high energies ( @xmath1 ev ) is to register their images in the optical ( mainly fluorescence ) light .",
    "this can be done by observing showers from the side in order to avoid the more intense cherenkov light emitted rougly in the shower direction .",
    "the observations are made by a number of optical telescopes , each containing a large mirror and a camera with a matrix of photomultipliers ( pmts ) placed at the focus of the optical system ( hires @xcite , the pierre auger observatory @xcite , the telescope array @xcite ) , so that photons arriving from a given direction on the sky are focused on a particular pmt ( pixel ) .",
    "photon arrival time can also be measured if the time structure of the pmt signals is recorded . a cosmic ray induced shower produces at a given time a light spot on the camera which moves across it as the shower develops in the atmosphere so that succeeding pmts are being hit .",
    "+ it would have been ideal if the light producing a shower image had contained the fluorescence photons only .",
    "this is because there exists experimental evidence that the number of fluorescence photons induced by a charged electron in the atmosphere is proportional to the energy lost by it for ionisation @xcite . as practically all primary particle energy",
    "is eventually used for ionisation , this energy can be determined by measuring the fluorescence light emitted along the shower track in the atmosphere .",
    "+ however , there are several problems in deriving the flux of the fluorescence light emitted by a shower from that arriving at the detector .",
    "firstly , the arriving light contains not only the fluorescence but also cherenkov photons . if the viewing angle ( the angle between the line of sight and the shower direction ) is large ( say , @xmath2 ) then it is mainly the cherenkov light",
    "_ scattered _ in the atmosphere region just passed by the shower and observed by the detector ( this light , before being scattered , travels roughly along the directions of the shower particles ) .",
    "typically its fraction at the detector is about @xmath3 of the fluorescence flux . for smaller viewing angles",
    "it is the cherenkov light _",
    "produced _ at the observed part of the shower that may dominate even the fluorescence signal .",
    "the contribution of the cherenkov light , which has to be subtracted from the total signal , has been extensively studied @xcite . + the subject of this paper is another phenomenon , affecting shower images , most commonly called the multiple scattering ( ms ) of light",
    ". photons produced at the observed shower element , whatever their origin ( fluorescence or cherenkov ) , may undergo scattering in the atmosphere on their way from the shower to the detector , causing an attenuation of the light flux arriving at the detector and a smearing of the image .",
    "this scattering may take place on the air molecules ( rayleigh scattering ) or on larger transparent particles , aerosols ( mie scattering ) .",
    "most of the scattered photons change their directions , so that they no longer arrive at the pixel registering the not scattered ( direct ) light .",
    "moreover , they arrive later having longer path lengths to pass . on the other hand ,",
    "photons emitted by the shower at earlier times and scattered somewhere , may fall in the field of view of the pixels just registering the direct photons emitted at a later time .",
    "the net effect is that the scattered light forms its own instantaneous image superimposed on that in the direct light .",
    "+ our aim is to calculate the shower images in the multiply scattered light , so that this effect could be allowed for ( subtracted ) when determining the shower primary energy from the pmt signals .",
    "this problem was already studied by roberts @xcite , by us in several , short conference contributions @xcite and more recently by pkala et al @xcite .",
    "the approach of the other authors was based on monte carlo simulations of photons emitted by a shower .",
    "photons were followed up to 5 - 6 scatterings and their arrival directions and time were registered by the detector .",
    "many shower simulations were needed to obtain the ms images for various distances , heights , viewing angles of the observed shower parts .",
    "finally , a phenomenological parametrisation of the number of ms photons was made as a function of the parameters found as relevant .",
    "+ in contrast to roberts and pkala et al this approach is based on an analytical treatment .",
    "the main idea is to consider the arriving ms light as a sum of the photons scattered only once ( the first generation ) , of those scattered two times ( the second generation ) and so on and calculate separately the angular and temporal distributions for each generation .",
    "+ we start ( section 2 ) with a consideration of the simplest situation when a point source of isotropic light flashes for a very short time in an uniform medium .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the angular and temporal distributions of the first and next generations of light arriving at a particular distance from the source . + as our aim is to apply our results to cosmic ray showers we need to consider a non - uniform medium like the atmosphere . assuming an exponential distribution of the gas density and similarly for aerosols we show that an effective scattering length between any two points in the atmosphere can be easily calculated analytically .",
    "signals of the first two generations arriving at a particular detector within a given angle @xmath4 to the direction to the source are found as a function of time ( section 3 ) .",
    "+ using these it is straightforward to derive the corresponding distributions if the source moves across the atmosphere , integrating the point source distributions over changing distance and time of light emission . in section 4",
    "we consider a moving light source , modelling a distant shower .",
    "we calculate angular distributions of ms light arriving at a detector at the same time as the direct ( not scattered ) photons emitted by the shower .",
    "this particular approach is quite natural because the data from optical detectors consist of the recorded signals by the camera pmts within short time intervals @xmath5 so that one needs to know how much of the ms light has to be subtracted from the main , direct signal .",
    "the method for calculating images in the ms light _ simultaneous _ with images in the direct light is relatively simple ( for the first and the second generations ) as it is based on the geometry of the scattered photons in the particular generation .",
    "it does not require time - consuming monte - carlo simulations that were done for various shower - observer geometries .",
    "making some approximations we derived analytical formula for a shower image produced by the first generation ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "our analytical derivations allowed us to choose easily the variables on which and how to parametrise the ms signals .",
    "they also made us to realise that the dependence of it on the viewing angle was different for rayleigh and mie scatterings .",
    "thus , we introduced a new , simple parametrisation of the fraction of the scattered photons arriving at the telescope within a given viewing cone , depending on the viewing angle of the shower ( what has not been done before ) , separately for the two scatterings .",
    "for the same reason we also parametrised separately the second generation ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "+ a discussion of the results and the implication of the ms effect on the derivation of shower parameters is given in section 5 .",
    "the last section ( 6 ) contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "at any fixed time a distant shower can be regarded as a point source emitting isotropically fluorescence light ( about cherenkov light see later ) . as explained above",

    "( what @xmath311 means ) that counts but by some _ particular values _ of it .",
    "this decreases the probability of such a scattering and can be viewed as an increase of the ( actually ) effective mean free path length @xmath476 for the process _ we are interested in _ ( i.e. photons arriving at the detector ) .",
    "one could estimate its value from the ratio @xmath477 or @xmath478 adopting for this aim a poisson distribution of the number of contributing generations .",
    "the two obtained values differ typically by 30 - 60@xmath479 , so that an estimation of the share of the remaining generations on the basis of this uncertain @xmath476 is uncertain as well . however , let us take an example : @xmath480 , elevation angle @xmath481 , @xmath482 , what are typical conditions for registered showers in the auger observatory .",
    "the two values of the mean number of ( effective ) scatterings are @xmath483 ( from @xmath477 ) and @xmath484 ( from @xmath478 ) . assuming the larger one , one gets @xmath485 for a fraction of the third and higher generations . + however , as our earlier work for a uniform medium @xciteb ) shows , where the third generation was calculated , its share was two times smaller than that deduced from the poisson model and the ratios @xmath477 and @xmath478 , so that this estimation may be too high .",
    "thus , we estimate that the contribution of the higher number generations should be small , at least for the conditions of auger .",
    "integrated within angle @xmath4 , for shower 24 @xmath441 away from the detector , at elevation angle @xmath221 .",
    "our results ( first and second generation ) are represented by thick solid lines for @xmath486 and thin solid lines - for @xmath487 and @xmath488 ( second generation ) .",
    "parametrisation from monte - carlo works : roberts - dashed line and pkala et al - dotted line.,height=288 ]    the problem of the influence of the scattered light on the shower image in the direct light was first undertaken by roberts @xcite .",
    "he treated it by monte - carlo simulations of tracks of individual photons emitted by vertical showers . such shower",
    "( although , strictly speaking , non - existing ) enabled the author to introduce a detector in a form of a ring around the shower as its symmetry axis , increasing dramatically the number of registered photons .",
    "although the author appreciate that the singly scattered photons dominated the total ms signal , his simulations went to more than five scatters , including both rayleigh and mie .",
    "he obtained a parametrisation of the ratio of the ms signal to the total signal ( ms + direct ) in the form @xmath489 where @xmath490 is the total optical depth ( molecular and aerosol ) between the detector and the light source , @xmath19 - total scattering coefficient ( in @xmath491 ) at the source . in our terms",
    "@xmath492 , @xmath493 , where @xmath311 is determined by formula ( 36 ) and @xmath317 depends only on the height in the stable atmosphere , so that ( 74 ) would mean the following @xmath494 this parametrisation differs from those obtained in the present work although not very much .",
    "it has a weaker dependence on the angle @xmath4 , which in our case is as ( about ) @xmath495 .",
    "the smaller power index at @xmath496 ( @xmath497 in our case ) is to some extent compensated by the term @xmath498 . +",
    "another work , dealing with the present problem was that of pkala et al @xcite .",
    "the calculation method was monte - carlo as well .",
    "this paper did consider inclined showers so that the cylindrical symmetry , as in the previous case did not apply . instead large `` packages '' of photons were assumed to behave in the same way , according to simulated points and directions of their scattering .",
    "after extensive simulations the authors arrived at a parametrisation of the ratio @xmath133 of the ms signal to the direct one as follows @xmath499 with @xmath500 .",
    "for a one component exponential atmosphere with the scale height @xmath501 we would have @xmath502 indeed , it is not difficult to check that an effective scale height of the two - component atmosphere used by the authors for @xmath503 is about @xmath504 what approximately equals @xmath501 . thus , their parametrisation would be as @xmath505 it is not far from our derivation for the first generation , where the term @xmath506 does not appear .",
    "a comparison of the ratio of the total ms signal to the direct one as a function of @xmath4 , obtained in this study with that of roberts and pkala et al is presented in fig .",
    "the agreement is quite good for @xmath507 but for larger @xmath4 the other authors seem to have underestimated a little the effect .",
    "previous studies of the influence of the scattering of photons on their way from the shower to the detector on the shower image used monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the effect has been called `` the multiple scattering '' since it was not clear how many times the photons arriving simultaneously with the direct light actually scatter .",
    "although roberts @xcite appreciated the importance of photons scattered one time only he went on with simulating till several scatterings .",
    "+ the main idea of this study was to divide the scattered light into separate generations : the first generation being photons scattered exactly one time , the second one two times , and so on .",
    "this enabled us to find analytically the angular distributions of photons as a function of time for the first generation which turned out to be the most important one .",
    "we also showed that any next generation can be found by some numerical integrations of the previous one .",
    "these results were obtained for a point source in a uniform medium as well as in the actual atmosphere ( although more numerical integrations were needed in the latter case ) . by considering",
    "separately the first generation it was easy to understand the differences between the two cases .",
    "the ratio of the second to the first generation is very small for small times after the light emission which will turn out to be relevant when considering the scattered light from extensive air showers what is a final aim of this study .",
    "+ in particular , this aim was to calculate the angular distributions of scattered photons arriving simultaneously with the direct ( not scattered ) light emitted by an extensive air shower and find relevant parameters determining these distributions .",
    "the solutions for a point source were useful here since a shower could be treated as a series of consecutive ( in space and time ) point sources . for the first and the second generations ( the most important ) we have explained where actually the scattering points took place , so that we were able to integrate over all of them .",
    "+ we have derived an analytical expression ( although approximate ) for the angular distribution of the first generation photons , scattered by the rayleigh process , fitting quite well the exact numerical distributions .",
    "the analytical solutions have led us to a proper choice of the independent variables for a final parametrisation of the numerical results .",
    "for example the number of photons in the n - th generation turns out to be proportional to @xmath508 , at least for @xmath509 ( although for mie with some correction ) . knowing the positions of the scatterings we were able to show that there should be a dependence on the viewing angle @xmath310 , not taken into account in the considerations of the previous authors .",
    "moreover , this dependence should be different for the rayleigh and the mie scatterings .",
    "thus , we parametrised the first generation separately for these two processes .",
    "concerning the second generation we combined all four possibilities of the two scatterings ( rr , rm , mr and mm ) to give just one parametrisation since its contribution was rather small .",
    "+ from our parametrisation it follows that for @xmath510 ( corresponding to a constant observed lateral dimension of a shower ) the contribution of the ms component to the direct light depends practically only on the height of the observed shower element and on the viewing angle ( the latter dependence being rather mild ) .",
    "a typical overestimation of the primary shower energy ( if the ms effect was ignored ) would be @xmath0 and of the depth of shower maximum @xmath467 .",
    "our analytical and numerical approach gives similar results as the previous monte - carlo work of other authors , although the parametrisation obtained in this paper is different . only for larger opening angles @xmath511",
    "the prediction of the ms contribution obtained here is a bit larger , what would have some implications for a reconstruction of very close showers .",
    "+ summarising we conclude that the ms effect is not to be neglected while reconstructing parameters of the extensive air showers .",
    "to be properly allowed for a good knowledge of the atmospheric conditions is necessary @xcite for determining values of @xmath317 , as the shower traverses the atmosphere .",
