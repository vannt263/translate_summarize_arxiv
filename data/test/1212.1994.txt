    "actually , the agn may only spend a small fraction of its lifetime in the highly luminous , qso - like phase , and much more time is spent in a weakly accreting state ( llagns or normal galaxies , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both bright agns and llagns are believed to be powered by the matter falling onto a super massive black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the observational properties of llagns are quite different from those of bright qsos , which are thought to be driven by different accretion modes .",
    "the optical / uv bumps observed in qsos can be naturally interpreted as multi - temperature blackbody emission from a cold , optically thick , and geometrically thin standard disk ( ssd , * ? ? ?",
    "however , most of llagns lack the evident optical / uv bump as that of bright agns .",
    "the possible physical reason is that the standard thin accretion disk is absent in these llagns .",
    "a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick radiatively inefficient accretion flow model has been developed in the last several decades ( riaf , an ` updated ' version of the original advection dominated accretion flow model , adaf ; e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; see kato et al .",

    "the agns are traditionally divided into radio loud ( rl ) and radio quiet ( rq ) , and the origin for this dichotomy is still a matter of debate .",
    "the distinction between the rl and rq objects is normally based on a radio - loudness parameter , which was defined as the ratio of the monochromatic flux density at 5  ghz and optical b band at 4400  @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the loudness @xmath3 is usually taken as the division between rq and rl agns ( particularly in qso studies , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite introduced a new definition of the radio loudness parameter by comparing the 5 ghz radio luminosity to the 2 - 10 kev luminosity , @xmath4 , and proposed that @xmath5 would be the barrier separating rl and rq agns , which roughly corresponding to @xmath3 . the use of x - ray luminosity with respect the optical one should largely avoid extinction problems which normally occur in the optical band . however ,",
    "most of the traditionally rq llagns become rl according to the criterion @xmath3 or @xmath5 if using their nuclear emission at radio and optical / x - ray waveband ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite redefined the boundary for the rl and rq llagns as @xmath6 based on a sample of low - luminosity seyferts and fanaroff - riley type i radio galaxies ( fr is ) . in the last decade , there is great progress in estimating the bh mass in both normal galaxies and agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measurements of bh mass help us to further understand the issue of radio loudness .",
    "@xcite found that the loudness parameter increases with decreasing of the eddington ratio .",
    "@xcite investigated the radio loudness of a total 199 sources which include broad - line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) , rl qsos , seyferts , low - ionization nuclear emission - line region galaxies ( liners ) , fr is , and palomar - green qsos ( pgqs ) , and found that there are two distinct , approximately parallel tracks on radio - loudness@xmath0eddington - ratio plane .",
    "they further proposed a quantitative definition for the radio - loudness parameter that is dependent on the eddington ratio ( see their equation 5 ) , where the rl sources include blrgs , rl qsos , fr is , while rq sources comprise seyferts , liners and pgqs ( hereafter we use this criteria to distinguish the rl / rq ) .    the radio emission of rl agns is believed to originate in the relativistic jets , where many large - scale radio jets have been observed directly . compared with rl agns ,",
    "the origin of nuclear radio emission from rq objects is still not well understood , since that rq agns are much fainter radio sources , and most of them only show a compact radio core .",
    "the radio variability of rq qsos confined the radio emission to @xmath70.1  pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the high - resolution vlbi observations show that the region of the radio emission in rq llagns should be @xmath8 to @xmath9 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several possibilities have been proposed to explain the radio emission in these rq agns .",
    "the first explanation is that rq agns are scaled - down version of the rl agns where exist a weak , small - scale jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a small fraction of rq objects show core - jet or linear structures at pc - scale or sub - pc scale , which do support the weak - jet scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this scenario can not answer the bimodality of rl / rq distribution for agns ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second possibility is that the radio emission of the rq agns come from the hot optically thin plasma in the disk winds , where the plasma is completely ionized and has a density high enough for bremsstrahlung emission that make a significant contribution to the observed compact radio core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    "the mass - loss rate in the winds are significant and the observed luminosities of radio emission from quasars imply that they should accrete at super - eddington rates .",
    "however , most of rq agns are accreting at sub - eddington rates , where the radio core emission should not dominantly come from the disk winds .",
    "the third possibility is that the radio emission also come from the accretion flows ( e.g. , riaf or disk corona ) .",
    "@xcite found that the tight correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities in rq qsos is similar to that of active stars ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they , therefore , proposed that both the radio and x - ray emission from the nuclei of rq agns may dominated by the magnetic reconnection heated corona .",
    "@xcite found that the radio emission of most nearby llagns is higher than that predicted by radiation from the pure thermal electrons in the riaf , and their radio emission should have other origin ( e.g. , nonthermal electrons in riaf or jet ) .",
    "the radio spectrum of sgr a * , a supermassive bh in our galaxy , consists of two components , which dominate below and above 86 ghz , respectively .",
    "@xcite found that the component above 86 ghz can be well explained by the thermal electrons from the riaf , while low - frequency radio spectrum can be explained if there exist a small fraction of nonthermal electrons in the riaf ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is natural that both the thermal and nonthermal electrons exist in the hot plasma ( riaf or disk corona ) , since that the turbulence , magnetic reconnection , and weak shocks can accelerate electrons and generate a nonthermal tail at high energies in the distribution function of thermal electrons .",
    "the sgr a * provide an excellent observational evidence for the existence of hybrid of thermal and nonthermal electrons in accretion flows ( e.g. , riaf ) , since that no evident radio jet was observed up to now and , therefore , its radio emission may be dominated by other mechanisms .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is also independent observational evidence for nonthermal electrons in accretion flows .",
    "@xcite reported a high - energy tail in the hard state of the x - ray binary , cygnus x-1 , extending from 50 kev to @xmath115 mev .",
    "the data at mev energies , collected with the comptel instrument of the compton gamma - ray observatory , can be explained by a power - law distribution of nonthermal electrons in the riaf / corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite observed six nearby llagns with high - resolution vlba , and found that the radio emission is still unresolved even at milliarcsecond scale , which roughly corresponds to several to ten thousands gravitational radii .",
    "therefore , contrary to the rl agns which have been observed with jet or core - jet structures directly , the physical origin of the radio emission in rq agns is much unclear .",
    "the most popular model is that there may exist a scaled - down version of the jet in rq agns .",
    "the coupled riaf - jet model has been explored to fit the multiwavelength spectrum of llagns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that it is reasonable to apply the riaf - jet model to the sources with observed jet structures ( e.g. , fr is ) , while it is still controversial whether the same model can be used to the llagns with only compact radio cores , where these sources have no evident jet structure even at scale of several thousand gravitational radii .",
    "another possibility is that the radio emission in rq agns also originate in the hot plasma ( e.g. , riaf in llagns and disk - corona in bright agns ) , where the turbulence , weak shocks and/or magnetic reconnection events may occasionally accelerate a fraction of the electrons to a harder power - law tail .",
    "the synchrotron emission from these nonthermal power - law electrons may account for the radio emission from the compact cores of these llagns .",
    "the hybrid thermal - nonthermal synchrotron emission from the riaf have well reproduced the two components of the radio spectrum and also the x - ray flares observed in sgr a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we confirm the result that the pure riaf always underpredicts the radio emission for nearby llagns @xcite .",
    "however , the low - frequency radio emission of the compact cores in llagns can be accounted if only a small fraction of the viscous dissipation energy in the accretion flow goes into accelerating electrons to a nonthermal power - law distribution ( see figures [ f4]-[f5 ] ) .",
    "it is well established that magnetic reconnection should be unavoidable and play an important role in converting the magnetic energy into the particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". both the magnetic reconnection itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or the diffusive shock caused by the violent plasma motions in the magnetic reconnection region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can naturally accelerate a small fraction of the electrons to be the power - law distribution .",
    "a small fraction of the power - law electrons presented in the riaf will not affect the global structure of the riaf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , our work provide the possibility that the radio emission of nearby llagns may originate in the nonthermal electrons of the hot accretion flow",
    ". it may be the similar case for other bright rq agns , where the radio emission is dominated by the nonthermal electrons in the corona .",
    "@xcite found the similarities of the radio / hard x - ray correlation in rq agns and magnetically active stars , which support that the radio emission of rq agns also dominantly come from the corona as that of active stars .",
    "we will further test this issue in a subsequent work for bright rq agns considering the possible physical mechanism for the production of thermal and nonthermal electrons in the corona above the ssd .",
    "@xcite found a strong anticorrelation between the radio loudness and eddington ratio for the llagns ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate the dependence of the mass - corrected radio loudness , @xmath131 , on the eddington ratio , @xmath154 , where the scaling of @xmath155 is derived from our model as that @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we find that the mass - corrected radio loudness is still anticorrelate with the eddington ratio , where both quantities are not affected by the mass term .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dependence of the radio emission on the bh mass , @xmath157 , in our model is similar to that of jet model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that derived from the observed fundamental plane of bh activity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be cautious to get the conclusion that the origin of the radio and x - ray emission is similar for the stellar - mass bh x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and the supermassive bh agns based only on the fundamental plane equation of the bh activity , since that the dependence of the radio emission on the bh mass is similar for our model and the jet model .",
    "we find that the relation between the radio luminosity and x - ray luminosity is @xmath158 at a given bh mass in our model based on @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "our model prediction on the radio@xmath0x - ray correlation is much shallower than that observed in xrbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or that predicted by accretion - jet model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath161 .",
    "our results provide a diagnostic that can distinguish the possible origin of the radio emission in llagns by investigating the radio@xmath0x - ray correlation for llagns with the same or similar bh masses . however , our present sample is still limited , which prevent us to further test this issue .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", there are still some uncertainties in the current riaf model with hybrid thermal and nonthermal electrons .",
    "the dependence of the spectrum on the model parameters have been explored in former works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the riaf spectrum is not sensitive to some parameters ( e.g. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , we adopt the typical values @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are constrained from observations and/or simulations .",
    "wind parameter @xmath95 is adopted directly , which is constrained from observations of sgr a*. we adopt the radius @xmath109 as the outer boundary .",
    "we find that the x - ray emission mainly come from the innermost region of the accretion flow , which is less affected by the outer boundary condition if it is larger than several tens gravitational radii .",
    "however , we find that the low - frequency radio emission come from the much larger regions from several tens to several thousand gravitational radii .",
    "the llagns in our sample have very low eddington ratios ( @xmath162 ) , and the whole accretion may be through riaf .",
    "@xcite proposed that the truncation radius should be around one thousand to several tens of thousands gravitational radii ( if the possible outer ssd is present ) for @xmath163 as adopted in fitting the sed of the llagns in our sample .",
    "therefore , the assumption of the outer boundary @xmath109 should be reasonable , and will not affect our main results .",
    "the region of the radio emission from the nonthermal electrons in riaf is more or less consistent with the size of the compact radio cores as observed by the vlbi for some nearby llagns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we neglect the contribution of the emission from the possible outer ssd ( if present ) in our sed fittings , since that we still do nt know whether the outer ssd still exists in the llagns with extreme low eddington ratios or not , and the optical emission also easily suffer the contamination from the host galaxies or contaminate by the nuclear starbursts . for example",
    ", @xcite reported an evidence of recent starburst formation in the nucleus of ngc 1097 , and its optical / uv emission may dominated by the stellar contribution .",
    "we find that our model prediction on the optical emission is slightly smaller than the observed emission but higher than the lower limits of the possible intrinsic agn optical emission that derived from optical variabilities .",
    "therefore , the observed optical emission of llagns is roughly consistent with our model predictions even without considering the possible contribution from the outer ssd ( e.g. , figures [ f4]-[f5 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 , describing the fraction of the turbulent dissipation that directly heats the electrons in the flow , is still unclear , which may be in the range of several percent up to several tens percent based on recent simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or model fitting of the sgr a * @xcite .",
    "we find that most of llagns in our sample can be better fitted if @xmath101 is adopted ( see figures [ f4]-[f5 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted @xmath101 is slightly smaller than that used in sgr a * ( @xmath164 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may caused by different microphysics since that the accretion rate in sgr a * much smaller than that used in our work .",
    "our results will be roughly unchanged even if we use @xmath164 as that used in sgr a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the model fitting of the x - ray emission is less perfect as that with @xmath101 .",
    "the values of @xmath102 and @xmath17 that describing the nonthermal electrons is not strongly constrained , but which are degenerate for low - frequency radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we fix the typical value of @xmath102=3.0 , and then adjust the parameter @xmath17 to fit the radio emission of llagns in our sample .",
    "we find that only a small fraction of the energy in nonthermal electrons is sufficient to produce the radio emission at low frequencies .",
    "the value of @xmath17 can even be smaller if the parameter @xmath102 is also smaller .",
    "our fitting results show that the value of @xmath17 in these llagns of our sample is more or less consistent with that constrained for sgr a * ( e.g. , @xmath111% in * ? ? ?",
