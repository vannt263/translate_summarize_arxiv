    "high finesse optical cavities that are operated detuned from resonance are ubiquitously present in a variety of applications that include cavity optomechanics @xcite , laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors @xcite , cavity qed experiments @xcite , cold atom microscopy @xcite , and ion trapping @xcite , to name a few .",
    "acquiring low noise , high bandwidth signals for locking optical cavities that are detuned from resonance by an arbitrary amount is a challenge .",
    "the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking method @xcite is perhaps the most common technique used for locking cavities on resonance .",
    "pdh error signals are generated by phase modulating the light incident on the cavity at rf frequencies that typically place the modulation sidebands outside the line width of the cavity , and demodulating the light reflected from the cavity .",
    "this is an extremely efficient and powerful technique for cavities operating on resonance , but the error signal becomes nonlinear and even changes sign when the cavity is detuned from resonance , making it unsuitable for use at detunings exceeding a small fraction of a line width .",
    "conversely , linear error signals for cavities that are detuned by half a line width can be obtained by amplitude modulating the incident light .",
    "an alternative method of locking a detuned cavity using the approximately linear regime of the intensity of the transmitted light ",
    "`` side of fringe '' or `` dc '' locking  is simple to implement , but is prone to noise couplings and offset drifts . again",
    "the linear regime of the signal is a small fraction of a cavity line width , and the signal vanishes on resonance .",
    "certainly , neither pdh nor side of fringe methods are useful for cavities that are detuned from resonance by several line widths .",
    "we demonstrate a technique where an admixture of amplitude modulation ( am ) and phase modulation ( pm ) yields useful error signals for cavities that are on resonance or continuously detuned by many line widths .",
    "cusack et al .",
    "proposed the `` universally tunable modulator ( utm ) '' where an electro - optic amplitude modulator was modified to generate an admixture of am and pm @xcite .",
    "they connected the inputs of the two crystals of the electro - optic modulator to separate electronic drives and showed that arbitrary ratios of am and pm could be generated by controlling the relative phase difference between the two drives .",
    "here we use a similar implementation of a dual input electrooptic modulator to generate smoothly varying error signals for a cavity operated on resonance or continuously detuned by several line widths .",
    "to determine the error signals from an optical cavity driven with an arbitrary combination of phase and amplitude modulated light , we review the theory of modulated light from the utm , and then derive expressions for the error signals for arbitrary detuning of the cavity .    the total field of a light beam modulated at a single frequency , @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath1 \\right ] \\exp\\left(i \\,\\re[\\tilde{p } e^{i \\omega_{m } t } ] \\right ) \\label{unimod}\\ ] ] where we have @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "the utm of cusack et al consists of a modified electro - optic amplitude modulator , shown in figure [ fig : utmdiagram ] .",
    "an amplitude modulator consists of two identical birefringent crystals with their optic axes aligned orthogonal to each other , and aligned such that they are left and right diagonal with respect to a vertical polarizer at the output of the modulator ( see figure [ fig : utmdiagram ] ) .",
    "when the two crystals are driven exactly out of phase , the electric field along one direction is phase advanced while the orthogonal polarization is phase retarded .",
    "the average phase is zero .",
    "there is no net phase modulation from elliptical to circular polarization and back again .",
    "filtering this oscillating polarization with a vertical polarizer produces an amplitude modulated beam .",
    "when the crystals are driven by separate phasors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , any modulation state within the space of am and pm can be achieved .",
    "the optical field exiting the utm is given by : @xmath12 } \\hat{l } + \\tilde e_{r }   e^{i \\re \\left[\\tilde \\delta_{2 }   { \\rm e}^{i \\omega_{m } t}\\right ] } \\hat{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electric field components along the left and right diagonal of the utm vertical axis , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the two drive phasors . assuming left and right diagonal field components are equal , i.e. , @xmath17 , and the signal drives @xmath18 are small , we have : @xmath19 ) \\hat{l } +   { \\rm e}^{i \\sigma } ( 1 + i \\re[\\tilde \\delta_{2 } e^{i \\omega_{m } t } ] ) \\hat{r}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",

    ", we see that the transfer function from utm input signals to the output modulation is : @xmath24    here we have assumed that left and right diagonal field components entering the utm are equal in magnitude .",
    "this transfer function differs from that derived by cusack et al . by a factor of @xmath25 , where the carrier suppression has been factored out .",
    "if the input field is circularly polarized , there is a symmetry between the two modulation phasors and the modulation depths are equal when driving each input separately .          for a fabry - perot cavity of length @xmath26 with input and end mirror reflectivities @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , and corresponding transmittances of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the reflection coefficient , defined as the ratio of the cavity reflected field to the incident field , is @xmath31 where the round - trip phase shift is given by @xmath32 .    rewriting this in terms of line widths of detuning from resonance",

    "light from a 1064 nm nd : yag laser passes through a half - wave plate , a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , a quarter - wave plate , and through the utm .",
    "our utm is a modified new focus 4140 amplitude modulator .",
    "the optical train leading to the utm ensures that the light incident on the utm is circularly polarized .",
    "a sample beam is incident on pd1 to directly detect amplitude modulation for diagnostic purposes .",
    "the main beam is incident on a free space cavity that is 10 cm in length .",
    "the input and end mirrors of the cavity have amplitude reflectivity of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , which gives the cavity a finesse of 270 .",
    "the cavity end mirror is attached to a pzt , enabling actuation of the cavity length .",
    "the cavity length was scanned through resonances by driving the pzt ; the resulting cavity error signal was measured by demodulating the signal on @xmath53 ( new focus 1811 ) with a local oscillator ( lo ) .",
    "the lo was derived from one of the two utm drives using a power splitter .",
    "the inputs to the utm were driven separately using a signal generator that outputs two signals with an arbitrary phase between them .",
    "this ability to control the relative phases of the two signals going into the utm is necessary to explore the entire modulation space .",
    "the relative phases of the drive signals going into the utm were adjusted in the range from 0 to 180 degrees in 30 degree intervals .",
    "the phase of the signal with respect to the lo was adjusted to measure both quadratures of the demodulated signal .",
    "figure [ fig : iphase ] shows the error signals as a function of cavity detuning for different modulation states , along with the theoretical model corresponding to equation ( [ errorsig ] ) above . as we detune the cavity , we are able to generate error signals based on different modulation states ranging from pure pm to pure am .",
    "we emphasize that only a subset of the possible modulation states are shown here .",
    "for example , one could drive one crystal only , varying polarization of the light instead to create different modulation depths of am and pm .",
    "this would correspond to the am and pm modulations being in phase .",
    "the theoretical model was fit using five parameters : two parameters accounted for the difference in the slope and offset of the amplitude of the error signal , two other parameters accounted for the transformation from the sweep time to cavity length actuation ( using a second order polynomial fit ) , and another parameter accounted for the zero point offset .",

    "dashed and solid lines correspond to the model and data , respectively , for each phase difference . the cavity transmission for a single fit is also overlaid at the top .",
    "the units on the y - axis are arbitrary.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an important question to ask is : how far can the cavity be detuned while still yielding a useable error signal ?",
    "it turns out that the if we allow the phases of the utm drive signal vary relative to the lo phase , the cavity can be detuned past the nominal half line width of detuning using pure am . in figure",
    "[ fig : lw ] , we plot the detuning ( in line widths ) as a function of input drive phases .",
    "we emphasize that this phase has a slightly different definition .",
    "previously we assumed that the lo phase was locked to one of the utm drives , hence only the phase difference was important . here",
    "the phase is set by first locking the phase of one of the drives to the lo , and varying the other drive from 0 to @xmath56 .",
    "next , the drive is locked at @xmath56 and the other drive is varied in the same manner .",
    "the phase in figure [ fig : lw ] is defined as the sum of the phases of the two drives , ranging from both drives locked to the lo to both drives @xmath56 out of phase with the lo .",
    "we see that this method provides a way to detune the cavity by multiple line widths .",
    "thus , the error signal generated using utm provides a convenient way to control the amount of detuning of a cavity .     before increasing the other drive to the same value.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have shown that we can use the vast modulation space of am and pm provided by a universal tunable modulator to generate error signals for a cavity that can be on resonance or many line widths detuned from resonance . by varying the phases of the drive signals to the utm we can keep the cavity locked at different detunings .",
    "our theoretical model for the cavity error signal agrees well with our measurements of the error signals derived by fixing the drive amplitudes and varying the phase differences of the drives .",
    "this is a fraction of the modulation space available , but has proved powerful technique for locking optical cavities with arbitrary detuning from resonance .",
