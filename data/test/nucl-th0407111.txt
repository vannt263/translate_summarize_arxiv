    "short - lived exotic nuclei offer unique tests of those aspects of our developing many - body theories that depend on neutron excess  @xcite .",
    "the major challenge is to predict or describe in detail exotic new properties of nuclei far from the stability valley , and to understand the origins of these properties .    for medium - mass and heavy nuclei",
    ", an important goal is obtaining a universal energy - density functional , which will be able to describe static and dynamic properties of finite nuclei and extended nucleonic matter with arbitrary neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "self - consistent methods based on density - functional theory are already sophisticated enough to allow precise analysis of ground - state properties ( e.g.  binding energies ) in heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "they can also help describe nuclear decays and excited states .",
    "their predictions for collective excitations as we approach the neutron drip line are especially interesting .",
    "what happens to low- and high - frequency multipole modes when the neutron excess is unusually large ?    to address these questions we use the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) , a powerful tool for understanding both low - lying vibrational states and giant resonances @xcite .",
    "the qrpa is a microscopic approach that is nevertheless simple enough to allow `` no - core '' calculations .",
    "the approximation , which should be good for collective vibrations as long as their amplitudes are small , is especially effective in conjunction with skyrme energy functionals .",
    "our work is a part of a broad program to test and improve these functionals , which thus far have been fitted mainly to ground - state observables , by applying them to collective excitations , particularly near the drip line .",
    "this paper lays out our approach and evaluates its accuracy . for these purposes",
    "we restrict ourselves to a single skyrme functional , skm@xmath0 .",
    "a forthcoming study will examine the performance of skyrme functionals more generally .",
    "the qrpa is a standard method for describing collective excitations in open - shell superconducting nuclei with stable mean - field solutions , either spherical or deformed .",
    "what is not standard , and at the same time is extremely important for weakly bound nuclei , is the treatment of the particle continuum .",
    "continuum extensions of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or qrpa are usually carried out in coordinate space , facilitating treatment of decay channels and guaranteeing correct asymptotics .",
    "surprisingly , as we discuss below , the rich literature on the rpa and qrpa , which includes many coordinate - space calculations , contains few treatments of the continuum that exploit the entire skyrme functional in a fully self - consistent way .    to avoid confusion",
    ", we state what we mean by a fully self - consistent rpa or qrpa calculation . first",
    ", the underlying mean - field calculation must be self - consistent in the usual sense .",
    "next , the residual interaction used in the rpa or qrpa must be derived from the same force or energy functional that determines the mean field .",
    "an important consequence of this condition , and of other more detailed technical conditions discussed below , is that spurious excitations arising from symmetry breaking by the mean field have zero or nearly zero energy , leaving the physical intrinsic excitations completely uncontaminated by spurious motion .",
    "finally , energy - weighted sum rules must be satisfied to high accuracy .",
    "we elaborate on these requirements below ; refs .",
    "@xcite discuss ways in which rpa calculations commonly violate them .",
    "the literature applying rpa or qrpa to nuclear structure is huge , and a complete review is beyond the scope of our paper .",

    "a number of papers treat collective states in spherical nuclei in the skyrme - rpa and qrpa matrix formulation ( see refs . @xcite and references cited therein ) , in which the positive - energy continuum is discretized , e.g.  by solving the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and qrpa equations in a harmonic - oscillator single - particle basis . within this group , the first fully self - consistent calculations that properly account for continuum effects are those of refs .",

    "@xcite and subsequently applied to the description of low- and high - energy nuclear modes ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "properties of excited states and strength functions have also been investigated within the relativistic rpa @xcite or qrpa @xcite .",
    "the qrpa work employs the matrix formulation and is fully self - consistent , since it uses the same lagrangian in the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov calculation of the ground state and in the qrpa matrix equations , which are solved in the canonical basis .    at the present ,",

    "we formulate the qrpa in the canonical eigenbasis of the one - body particle - density matrix @xcite which is calculated in the coordinate representation in a large spherical box .",
    "as mentioned above , the canonical basis has been used previously to study @xmath1 decay and gamow - teller strength @xcite ; its use in charge - conserving modes near the drip line is more challenging , however , because of the existence of spurious states in the monopole and dipole channels .",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains the main conclusions of our work .",
    "mathematical details are in two appendices , the first of which is on the qrpa equations and the second on calculating the derivatives of the skyrme functionals that enter the formalism .",
    "our first step in the self - consistent treatment of excitations is to solve the spherical hfb equations in coordinate space ( without mixing neutron and proton quasiparticle wave functions @xcite ) , with the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "we can use arbitrary skyrme functionals in the particle - hole and pairing ( particle - particle ) channels .",
    "we modify the code used in refs .",
    "@xcite so that it solves the hfb equations with higher accuracy , which we need because the qrpa uses all the single - quasiparticle states produced by the hfb equations , even those that are essentially unoccupied .",
    "our modifications are : ( i ) the use of quadruple precision ( though in solving the qrpa equations we use double precision ) ; ( ii ) a smaller discretization length ( 0.05 fm ) ; and ( iii ) a high quasiparticle - energy cutoff ( 200 mev ) and a maximum angular momentum @xmath3=15/2 ( @xmath4 ) or 21/2 ( @xmath5 ) . in a 20 fm box , this cutoff corresponds to 200300 quasiparticle states for each kind of nucleon .",
    "we include all these quasiparticle states in the hfb calculation because a very large energy cutoff is essential for the accuracy of self - consistent qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "hence , the effective pairing window in our hfb calculations is also very large , with the pairing functional fitted to experimental pairing gaps extracted as in ref .",
    "@xcite from the measured odd - even mass differences in several sn , ni , and ca isotopes .",
    "next , we construct the canonical basis , the eigenstates of single - particle density matrix @xmath6 . to avoid poor accuracy",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the wave functions of the nearly empty canonical particle states , we do not diagonalize @xmath6 directly in coordinate space .",
    "instead we construct an intermediate basis by orthonormalizing a set of functions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the upper and lower components of the quasiparticle wave function with energy @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we use the density matrix in coordinate space to calculate the matrix in this basis , which we then diagonalize to obtain the canonical states .",
    "the reason for using the sum of @xmath8 and @xmath11 is that solutions of the hfb equations expressed in the canonical basis ( eqs .",
    "( 4.14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are , in the new basis , _ guaranteed _ to be numerically consistent with those of the original hfb problem .",
    "this is because the configuration space is the same in both cases , independent of the pairing cutoff ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion relevant to this point ) . without pairing , when either @xmath12 or @xmath9 is equal to zero , our method is equivalent to taking a certain number of hf states , including many unoccupied states .    in the canonical basis ,",
    "the hfb+qrpa equations have a form almost identical to that of the bcs+qrpa approximation , the only difference being the presence of off - diagonal terms in the single - quasiparticle energies .",
    "the qrpa+hfb formalism employs more pairing matrix elements than the qrpa+bcs , however .    as noted already , full self consistency requires the use of the same interaction in the qrpa as in the hfb approximation . more specifically , this means that the matrix elements that enter the qrpa equation are related to second derivatives of a mean - field energy functional .",
    "we describe the densities and the form of the functional carefully in the appendices .",
    "but we must meet other conditions as well for qrpa calculation to be self - consistent .",
    "essentially all the single - particle or quasiparticle states produced by the hfb calculation must be used in the space of two - quasiparticle qrpa excitations .",
    "this requirement is rather stringent , so we truncate the two - quasiparticle space at several levels and check for convergence of the qrpa solution",
    ". first we omit canonical - basis wave functions that have occupation probabilities @xmath13 less than some small @xmath14 , ( or hf energies greater than some @xmath15 if there is no pairing ) .",
    "then we exclude from the qrpa pairs of canonical states for which the occupation probabilities are both larger than @xmath16 .",
    "this second cut is based on the assumption that two - particle transfer modes are not strongly coupled to particle - hole excitations .",
    "in addition , if the factors containing @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the qrpa equation  see eqs .",
    "( [ a_spherical ] ) and ( [ b_spherical ] )  are very small , in practice smaller than 0.01 , then we set the corresponding matrix elements equal to zero .",
