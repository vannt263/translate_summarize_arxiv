    "our understanding of the qcd matter at low temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and high baryon number densities ( @xmath1 ) has developed rapidly over the past few years ; for recent reviews , see @xcite .",
    "a likely scenario is that in this region , quarks form cooper pairs and new condensates develop .",
    "one of the most interesting questions today concerns the detailed mapping of the qcd phase diagram , especially in the above region where qcd may exhibit a colour superconducting phase . in this context",
    ", the light quark masses ( @xmath3 ) are expected to play an important role .",
    "figure 1 shows two likely scenarios corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the transition between the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase and the colour superconducting phase is expected to be first order , in qcd @xcite .    in this paper , we study the first - order phase transition between the qgp phase and the colour superconducting phase ( fig .",
    "our approach is phenomenological and is similar in spirit to that adopted by ct and kharchenko @xcite .",
    "they , however , studied the bose - einstein condensation in a gas of trapped atomic hydrogen at temperatures @xmath6 and densities @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "temperatures and densities that we shall consider here are , of course , vastly different , and qgp has very little in common with the atomic hydrogen gas . _",
    "interestingly , however , as we shall see , the same physics of activation energy barrier governs the formation of droplets in both cases . _",
    "it is important to get a handle on the cold and dense quark matter because of its possible relevance to the neutron - star core . while the region of _ asymptotic _ densities is amenable to rigorous calculations , the same can not be said about the region of _ intermediate _ densities studied here .",
    "both numerical ( lattice ) and direct experimental studies of this region of the qcd phase diagram are out of reach at the moment .",
    "hence a phenomenological study such as the present one is appropriate and worthwhile .",
    "it has allowed us to make quantitative statements about the schematic phase diagram in fig . 1",

    "the chiral symmetry is restored inside their droplets ( which they call nucleons ) but is broken outside .",
    "neergaard and madsen @xcite also have studied the droplet formation but in the qgp to hadronic matter transition occurring at low baryon number densities . in this paper , we have considered the qgp to colour - superconducting phase transition occurring at high @xmath1 . _ to our knowledge , droplet formation in this transition has not been discussed previously in the literature . _ our droplets are the opposite of those in @xcite in the sense that the chiral symmetry is broken inside our droplet , but is restored outside .",

    "we also need the baryon number density @xmath16 to be large compared to that for the normal nuclear matter , namely 0.17 @xmath17 .    if the interactions among the particles are treated to the lowest order in @xmath18 , the strong coupling constant ( fig .",

    "it was possible to obtain the above analytic expressions because we have considered the gas of quarks as well as antiquarks , rather than a gas of quarks alone @xcite . at low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 , the @xmath24 terms in the pressure dominate and the gluonic pressure arising from the first term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , is quite negligible .",
    "we now consider the first - order phase transition from qgp to the superconducting phase as the temperature is lowered ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the latter phase , as a result of the attractive one - gluon - exchange interaction between quarks in the colour @xmath27 channel , quarks near the fermi surface tend to pair up as bosons .",
    "these are the cooper pairs which we assume to be massless .",
    "density fluctuations in the metastable qgp gas may provide suitable conditions for nucleation and growth of a droplet of the superconducting phase .",
    "the high - temperature phase ( qgp ) is present around the droplet and the low - temperature superconducting phase exists inside the droplet .",
    "we will presently explore the energetics for the formation of such a droplet by calculating the energy barrier between the two phases .",
    "we have given above the expressions for number density , energy and pressure of the qgp ; see eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) .",
    "we now derive corresponding expressions for the superconducting phase inside the droplet .",
    "before we begin , it is necessary to recall important differences between the bcs superconductor and the colour superconductor .",
    "( a ) in the bcs theory of superconductivity the ratio of the energy gap ( @xmath28 ) to the fermi kinetic energy for a typical metal is of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , in the problem under consideration , the gap @xmath28 is estimated to vary between several tens of mev to about 100 mev @xcite , and the quark chemical potential @xmath24 appearing in eq .",
    "( 1 ) takes values between @xmath30 and @xmath31 mev for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 considered here .",
    "( b ) in the bcs superconductor , the debye energy @xmath32 is much smaller than the chemical potential @xmath33 , while in the colour superconductor , the two may be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "( c ) finally , if @xmath13 is the density of electrons and @xmath34 the pippard coherence length which measures the spatial extension of the cooper pair wave function , then in the bcs theory , @xmath35 . in the present case , on the other hand , @xmath36 fm for @xmath37 mev , and @xmath38 for the densities considered in this paper .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath39 pairs are rather compact objects unlike cooper pairs of electrons in a metal . for a good discussion of these and related issues ,",
    "see a review article by kerbikov @xcite .",
    "we shall make use of the above points while deriving expressions for thermodynamics quantities of the droplet .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall assume that all quarks in the energy interval @xmath40 form cooper pairs and all other quarks remain unpaired , and shall ignore other interactions .",
    "consider a spherical region of radius @xmath41 , volume @xmath42 , containing @xmath43 quarks out of which @xmath44 remain unpaired and @xmath45 undergo cooper pairing , when the pairing interaction is `` switched on '' .",
    "we have @xmath46 where @xmath47^{-1}$ ] with @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding energies @xmath49 are @xmath50 in the last equation @xmath51 is the number of cooper pairs ( bosons ) in the droplet and @xmath52 is the energy of the ground state of the single - particle spectrum of a spherical cavity of radius @xmath41 . due to the small size of the droplet , even the lowest excited",
    "state has energy which is very large compared to the temperature .",
    "therefore all the @xmath39 pairs tend to occupy the ground state @xcite .",
    "next , entropies @xmath53 are given by @xmath54,\\\\ s_2 & = & s_1 + \\frac{d_q v_d}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\int^{\\mu_q}_{\\mu_q-\\delta } 4 \\pi p^2 dp \\left [ f \\ln f + ( 1-f ) \\ln ( 1-f ) \\right],\\\\ s_3 & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55 can be taken to be zero for the reasons given above .",

    "contribution of antiquarks to the above thermodynamic quantities is smaller by many orders of magnitude .",
    "although we have included it in our calculations its effect is negligible .    the droplet pressure @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath67 and @xmath62 are as in eqs .",
    "( 14)-(15 ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the corresponding pressures due to antiquarks and @xmath75 is the pressure due to gluons in the droplet .",
    "consider once again the spherical region of radius @xmath41 .",
    "initially , i.e. before the pairing interaction is switched on , there are @xmath43 quarks , @xmath76 antiquarks and a certain number of gluons in it . in the final state ,",
    "i.e. when the pairing interaction is on , there are @xmath44 quarks , @xmath51 quark pairs , @xmath77 antiquarks , @xmath78 antiquark pairs and the same number of gluons as before . the activation energy ( @xmath79 ) is defined as the difference between the helmholtz free energies ( @xmath80 ) in the final and initial states .",
    "since the gluonic contribution cancels out , one gets @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 , this @xmath79 vanishes .",
    "the reader may wonder why surface tension of the droplet makes no appearance in our formalism . in the classical theory of nucleation , there are two competing contributions to the energy of a droplet : droplet formation reduces bulk free energy but only at the cost of surface energy .",
    "the former contribution wins if the droplet radius exceeds a certain critical value , while the surface tension ensures that a droplet with a smaller radius shrinks and disappears . in the formalism presented here ,",
    "energy of the droplet is calculated quantum mechanically .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that small droplets have large quantal energy and tend to dissolve back into the qgp gas .",
    "this is similar to the effect of the surface tension in the classical theory .",
    "moreover , the thermal wavelength ( @xmath15 ) of the quarks is so large that a classification of particles as those localized on the surface and those in the interior breaks down . in short",
    ", we did not neglect the surface energy ; it is included in the total free energy of the quantal droplet .",
    "the precise boundaries of the various phases in fig . 1 are not known .",
    "since the baryon number density ( @xmath1 ) of the normal nuclear matter is @xmath83 @xmath17 , we have performed numerical calculations for @xmath84 0.5 to 3 @xmath17 and temperature @xmath85 0 to 100 mev .",
    "the resulting quark chemical potential @xmath24 varies over @xmath86 mev and the baryon chemical potential @xmath87 varies over @xmath88 mev .",
    "this fully covers the densities likely to be seen in the neutron - star cores .",
    "we have considered four different values of the superconducting gap parameter @xmath28 , namely , 1 , 10 , 50 and 100 mev .    since we are interested in a gas of weakly interacting quarks , antiquarks and gluons , we take @xmath18 to be zero .",
    "small values of @xmath18 do not affect the results in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) significantly .",
    "we first choose a set of values for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and solve eq .",
    "( 1 ) numerically to determine @xmath24 .",
    "this @xmath24 is then used to evaluate @xmath89 as given by eq .",
    "also , once @xmath24 is determined , @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be evaluated separately by using @xmath92 ( above integrations can not be done analytically , and so it is not possible to get closed expressions like eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for @xmath90 and @xmath93 . )",
    "next , we choose a value for @xmath28 , and treating the droplet radius @xmath41 as a free parameter , calculate various other quantities ; see eqs .",
    "( 4)-(17 ) .",
    "some of these results are shown in figs .",
    "3 - 4 .    in our formalism , as in the classical theory ,",
    "the activation energy when plotted as a function of the radius ( fig .",
    "3 ) , initially increases from zero , attains a maximum , then starts decreasing monotonically eventually becoming negative for a sufficiently large value of the radius .",
    "in other words , the activation energy exhibits a barrier . _",
    "the barrier originates as follows_. consider eq .",
    "as already stated , the antiquark terms are extremely small . the terms @xmath94 and @xmath95 are also negligible and in fact they tend to cancel each other . that leaves three terms , namely @xmath96 and @xmath64 .",
    "for small radii , @xmath65 and the quantal energy term @xmath64 dominate pushing the activation energy curve upwards . for large radii",
    ", the @xmath68 term dominates pulling the curve to the negative domain . as expected , the barrier becomes wider if @xmath0 is raised or if @xmath1 is lowered .",
    "the critical radii can be read off from fig .",
    "3 . droplets with larger radii readily grow because that tends to reduce the activation energy .",
    "this in turn easily brings about the transition from qgp to the superconducting phase .",
    "figure 4 shows the ratio of the droplet pressure to the pressure of the surrounding gas , for @xmath97 mev .",
    "this ratio is significantly larger than unity for small droplets , which will tend to push the radii to larger values , thereby helping to bring about the qgp to superconducting phase transition . in the limit @xmath82",
    ", this ratio tends to unity and is thus incapable of pushing the droplet radii to larger values .",
    "it is interesting to know the properties of the droplet when the pressure inside the droplet ( eq .",
    "16 ) equals the pressure of the surrounding qgp gas ( eq .",
    "these results are shown in figs .",
    "the condition @xmath98 fixes @xmath41 .",
    "we solve the equation @xmath99 numerically to determine @xmath41 , for various values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath1 was varied from 0.5 to 3 @xmath17 in the steps of 0.5 @xmath17 .",
    "figure 5 shows the results for @xmath41 . as @xmath0 and/or @xmath1",
    "are increased , @xmath41 decreases .",
    "however , @xmath41 is found to be rather insensitive to the variation in @xmath1 .",
    "although we have varied @xmath0 between 0 and 100 mev , temperatures relevant for neutron stars are close to zero . because of the small value of @xmath41 , the energy of even the lowest excited state inside the droplet turns out to be several hundreds of mev which is large compared to the temperature , effectively forcing all cooper pairs ( bosons ) to occupy the ground state .",
    "_ note also that at low temperatures , the droplet radius @xmath41 is larger than the pippard coherence length @xmath100 .",
    "_    figure 6 shows the activation energy @xmath79 .",
    "first see the upper half of fig .",
    "6 . for a fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "as @xmath0 increases , @xmath79 changes its sign from negative to positive .",
    "this is expected because , at higher @xmath0 , droplet formation is energetically unfavourable . secondly , as @xmath1 increases",
    "( see curves labelled _ a _ to _ f _ ) , @xmath79 remains negative up to higher and higher @xmath0 .",
    "this is also expected because at higher @xmath1 , the transition to the superconducting phase is facilitated .",
    "now see the lower half of fig .",
    "6 . it shows the @xmath101 contour , in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "this is also the phase transition curve separating the qgp phase at high @xmath0 and the superconducting phase at low @xmath0 : recall @xmath102 where @xmath80 are the free energies of the two phases .",
    "both @xmath103 and @xmath104 decrease as @xmath0 increases and cross each other at some temperature , say @xmath105 ( fig .",
    "since the system follows the path of minimum @xmath80 , there is a kink in @xmath106 . in other words ,",
    "the slope @xmath107 has a discontinuity , indicating a first - order phase transition at @xmath105 .",
    "thus the @xmath101 contour serves to demarcate the region of the superconducting phase . note that as @xmath1 increases , the @xmath108 region in fig .",
    "6 survives up to higher and higher @xmath0 .",
    "we now present an estimate of the latent heat ( @xmath109 ) associated with the first - order phase transition considered in this paper .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath105 for any given @xmath1 can be determined from fig .",
    "the latent heat is then estimated as @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath97 mev , this turns out to be @xmath111 to @xmath30 mev and it increases with @xmath1 . in the limit @xmath82 , the two free - energy curves in fig . 7 coincide",
    ", @xmath79 vanishes , @xmath112 , there is no discontinuity in entropy , and the latent heat is zero .",
    "there is only one phase namely qgp , and there is no question of any phase transition .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "8 shows 3-dimensional surface plots of the ( normalized ) activation energy @xmath113 defined as @xmath114 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , for @xmath115 and 100 mev .",
    "it is clear that in the limit @xmath116 , the activation energy surface is flat and there is no energy advantage for the qgp to superconducting phase transition .",
    "indeed there would be only one phase , namely qgp , which would extend up to the @xmath117 axis .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath97 mev , the surface is such that the system would like to `` roll down '' the slope thereby bringing about the phase transition .",
    "it is interesting to compare the activation energy results for the qcd phase transition , obtained here with those for the bose - einstein condensation in a gas of trapped atomic hydrogen , presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "two gas densities were considered : @xmath118 @xmath8 and @xmath119 @xmath8 both at the same temperature @xmath120 .",
    "we have repeated their calculations for @xmath121 .",
    "their activation energy exhibits a barrier , and they denote the maximum value of the activation energy by @xmath122 .",
    "consider the ratio @xmath123 at the peak position and the corresponding number @xmath124 of particles in the droplet . in @xcite",
    "these two quantities are highly sensitive to the changes in the gas density and temperature .",
    "for the inset , it is @xmath125 a.u . ] for instance , for the above tiny change in the gas density , the ratio @xmath123 changes from 4.8 to 104.1 , and @xmath124 changes from 18 to 3862 .",
    "similar sensitivity was seen when @xmath0 was changed by a few @xmath126 .",
    "in contrast , the results presented here are relatively stable with respect to changes in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied hitherto unexplored first - order phase transition from qgp to a colour - superconducting phase , and have presented a simple model of the transition with very few assumptions .",
    "it provides numerical support to the prevalent ideas of phase structure of qcd in the low - temperature , high - baryon - number - density regime .",
    "we have studied properties of the droplets of the superconducting phase , formed at various points in the @xmath2 plane , for several values of the gap parameter .",
    "we have been able to estimate the extent of the superconducting phase in this plane and the latent heat of the transition . at low temperatures ,",
