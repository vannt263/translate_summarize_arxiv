    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) is a long term project with the main goal of searching for dark matter in our galaxy by identifying microlensing events toward the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) . at times",
    "the bulge is unobservable we conduct other long - term photometric programs .",
    "a complete list of side - projects attempted by the ogle team can be found in paczyski et al .",
    "in particular , during the observing seasons 1993 , 1994 and 1995 we monitored globular clusters ngc  104=47  tuc and ngc  5139=@xmath2  cen in a search for variable stars of various types . of primary interest was the detection of detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "in papers i , ii & iii ( kaluzny et al . 1996 , 1997a , 1997b ) we presented results for @xmath2  cen . here",
    "we report on variables discovered in the field of 47  tuc .",
    "the ogle project was conducted using the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "a single @xmath3 pixels loral ccd chip , giving a scale of 0.435 arcsec / pixel was used as the detector .",
    "the initial processing of the raw frames was done automatically in near - real time .",
    "details of the standard ogle processing techniques were described by udalski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    in 1993 we monitored fields 104a and 104b located west and east of the cluster center , respectively . in 1994 we monitored field 104c located north of the cluster center . in 1995 we monitored fields 104d and 104e covering southern part of the cluster . a condensed summary of the data used in this paper is given in table 1 .",
    "detailed logs of the observations can be found in udalski et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of centers of fields 104a - e are given in table 2 .",
    "a schematic chart with marked locations of all of the monitored fields is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "most of the monitoring was performed through the johnson @xmath0 filter .",
    "some exposures in the kron - cousins @xmath4 band were also obtained .",
    "most of observations in the @xmath0-band were collected with an exposure time ranging from 300 to 600 seconds ( 420 seconds was the most common value ) .",
    "the @xmath4-band exposures lasted 300 seconds .",
    "for the majority of the analyzed frames the seeing was better than 1.6 arcsec .",
    "the reduction techniques as well as the algorithms used for selecting potential variables are described in paper i. profile photometry was extracted with the help of dophot ( schechter et al .",
    "the total number of stars contained in data bases with @xmath0 band photometry ranged from 18397 to 33014 .",
    "table 3 gives condensed information about the numbers of stars analyzed for variability and about the quality of the derived photometry .",
    "the useful data were obtained for stars with @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we present results for 42 variables identified in the five observed fields .",
    "all except two are new discoveries and were assigned names oglegc212 - 255 .",
    "names oglegc217 and oglegc224 were given to previously known variables v9 and v3 ( eg . hogg 1973 ) .",
    "photometry obtained for these two stars was poor because their images were badly overexposed on most of analyzed frames .",
    "therefore , we decided to drop oglegc217=v9 and oglegc224=v3 from our list of variables .",
    "the rectangular and equatorial coordinates of the 42 newly identified variables are listed in table 4 .",
    "the rectangular coordinates correspond to positions of variables on the @xmath0-band `` template '' images .",
    "these images allow easy identification of all objects listed in table 4 .",
    "the name of the field in which a given variable can be identified is given in the 6th column .",
    "all frames collected by the ogle team were deposited at the nasa nss data center .",
    "frames mr5228 , mr5227 , mr7890 , mr14597 and mr14595 were used as templates for fields 104a , 104b , 104c , 104d and 104e , respectively .",
    "the transformation from rectangular to equatorial coordinates was derived from positions of stars which could be matched with objects from the astrometric list kindly provided by kyle cudworth . the number of `` transformation stars '' identified in a given field ranged from 55 to 100 .",
    "the adopted frame solutions reproduce equatorial coordinates of these stars with residuals rarely exceeding 0.5 arcsec .",
    "according to cudworth the absolute accuracy of equatorial coordinates for stars from his table is not worse than @xmath6 .",
    "our sample of variables includes 13 rr  lyr stars .",
    "table 5 lists basic characteristics of the light curves of these stars .",
    "the mean @xmath0 magnitudes were calculated by numerically integrating the phased light curves after converting them into an intensity scale .",
    "photometric data for the remaining variables are given in table 6 .",
    "the @xmath7 colors listed in tables 5 and 6 were measured at random phases . for each of fields we used a single exposure in the @xmath4 band bracketed by two exposures in the @xmath0 band . to determine the periods of identified variables we used an _ aov _ statistic ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "this statistic allows  in particular  reliable determination of periods for variables with non - sinusoidal light curves ( eg . eclipsing binaries )",
    ". phased light curves of rr  lyr stars are shown in figs . 2 & 3 while fig .",
    "4 presents phased light curves for the remaining variables with determined periods .",
    "time domain light curves for these variables for which we were unable to determine periods are shown in fig . 5 .",
    "figure 6 shows the location of all variables with known colors on the cluster color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . for the rr  lyr stars marked positions correspond to the intensity - averaged magnitudes . for the remaining variables we marked positions corresponding to the magnitude at maximum light .",
    "all but one rr  lyr stars are grouped around @xmath8 indicating that they belong to the smc .",
    "rr  lyr variable oglegc223 is a background object in the galactic halo .",
    "there are 12 certain eclipsing binaries in our sample of variables .",
    "this group of stars is dominated by contact binaries with ew - type light curves and periods shorter than 0.4 day .",
    "the only 3 stars whose light curves indicate a detached or semi - detached configuration are oglegc228 , oglegc240 and oglegc253 .",
    "oglegc240 is a detached binary with an ea - type light curve .",
    "the light curve of this variable is relatively noisy due to the faintness of the object .",
    "none the less examination of the individual frames leaves no doubts about the reality of the observed changes .",
    "the blue color and apparent magnitude of oglegc240 indicates that it is an a spectral type binary in the smc .",
    "+ oglegc228 shows a light curve typical of semi - detached binaries .",
    "this star is located among candidate blue - stragglers on the cluster cmd .",
    "oglegc253 is also a potential blue straggler .",
    "its light curve shows two minima of very different depth but we can not exclude possibility that the components of this binary are in geometrical contact .",
    "several systems with light curves similar to the light curve of oglegc253 were analyzed during last decade ( eg . hilditch , king & mcfarlane 1989 ) .",
    "although most of detected binaries are candidate blue stragglers , there are four contact systems located slightly to the red of the cluster main sequence .",
    "these four binaries are potential main sequence systems belonging to 47  tuc .",
    "we shall return below to the question about membership of identified contact binaries .",
    "variables which could not be classified as either rr  lyr stars or eclipsing binaries are generally red stars with periods ranging from 2 days to several weeks . six red variables which are located on or near the subgiant branch of 47  tuc",
    "can be considered candidates for cluster members .",
    "recently edmonds & gilliland ( 1996 ) reported discovery of low amplitude variability among a large fraction of k giants in 47  tuc . using the data collected with the hst they estimated that most of variable giants have periods between 2 and 4 days and @xmath0 amplitudes in the range 525 mmag .",
    "edmonds & gilliliand ( 1996 ) argue that the observed variability of k giants from 47  tuc is caused by low - overtone pulsations .",
    "the variable k giants from our sample have periods ranging from 2 to 36 days and show full amplitudes in the @xmath0 band ranging from 0.08 to 0.18 mag . based on the quality of our data",
    "we estimate conservatively that we should be able to detect any periodic variables among cluster giants with periods up to 2 weeks and full amplitudes exceeding 0.05 mag .",
    "we note that six candidates for variable k giants identified by us can easily be studied spectroscopically .",
    "such observations would answer the question about the mechanism of observed photometric variability .",
    "since observed light variations are sufficiently large to imply detectable changes of @xmath9 if the variability is indeed due to pulsations .",
    "variables with @xmath10 and @xmath11 are likely to be evolved stars on the agb in the smc .",
    "we note that smc stars can be easily distinguished from 47  tuc members based on their radial velocities ( heliocentric radial velocities of smc and 47  tuc are @xmath12 km / s and @xmath13 km / s , respectively ) .",
    "we consider some of our period determinations as preliminary .",
    "particularly , for oglegc229 we adopted @xmath14  @xmath15 because the light curve seems to show two distinct minima .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the correct period is in fact half this value .",
    "also the period of oglegc240 can be half the adopted value of @xmath16 . for @xmath17  @xmath15 our light curve of oglegc240",
    "would show just one detectable eclipse .",
    "the 47  tuc cluster is located at a hight galactic latitude of @xmath18  deg .",
    "however , we can not assume that all eclipsing binaries listed in table 6 are cluster members .",
    "in particular , faint contact binaries with @xmath19 are known to occur at high galactic latitudes ( eg .",
    "saha 1984 ) .",
    "we have applied the absolute brightness calibration established by rucinski ( 1995 ) to calculate @xmath20 for the newly discovered contact binaries .",
    "rucinski s calibration gives @xmath20 as a function of period , unreddened color @xmath21 and metallicity : @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we adopted for all systems @xmath23=-0.76 $ ] and @xmath24 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the period versus an apparent distance modulus diagram for contact binaries identified in fields 104a - e .",
    "an apparent distance modulus was calculated for each system as a difference between its @xmath25 magnitude and @xmath26 .",
    "an apparent distance modulus for 47  tuc is estimated at @xmath27 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "the only system with significantly deviating value of @xmath28 is oglegc245 .",
    "this binary is most probably a foreground variable .",
    "the remaining 8 systems plotted in fig . 7 are likely members of the cluster .",
    "our survey resulted in the identification of 8 contact binaries which are likely members of the cluster and 2 detached / semidetached binaries which are possible blue stragglers belonging to the cluster .",
    "only 4 contact systems were identified below the cluster turnoff .",
    "these numbers are surprisingly small considering that we analyzed the light curves of 76119 stars with average magnitudes @xmath29 , mostly main sequence stars belonging to the cluster . for the clusters members the limiting magnitude @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath31 .",
    "we adopted here @xmath32 for the apparent distance modulus of 47  tuc ( hesser et al .",
    "the quality and quantity of photometry was sufficient to allow the detection of potential eclipsing binaries with periods shorter than 1 day and exhibiting eclipses deeper than about 0.3 mag ( see tables 1 & 3 ) .",
    "a hint that our survey is quite complete with respect to faint short period variables comes from the fact that we detected 12 rr  lyr stars from the smc .",
    "graham ( 1975 ) searched for variables a field covering an area @xmath33 .",
    "his field was centered north of 47  tuc and included a small part of the cluster .",
    "graham identified 76 rr  lyr stars , with surface density of 0.016 variables per arcmin@xmath34 .",
    "the effective area covered by our survey was 935 arcmin@xmath34 yelding surface density of rr  lyr stars of about 0.013 variables per arcmin@xmath35 .",
    "apparently we did not miss in our survey too many rr  lyr stars from the smc .",
    "the relative frequency of occurrence of @xmath36 contact binaries in our sample is @xmath37 .",
    "this frequency is more than an order of magnitude lower than the binary frequency observed for fields containing galactic open clusters ( kaluzny & rucinski 1993 ; mazur , krzeminski & kaluzny 1995 ) and for fields located near the galactic center which were monitored by ogle ( rucinski 1997 ) .",
    "recent surveys of globular clusters m71 ( yan & mateo 1994 ) and m5 ( yan & reed 1996 ) gave @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .    to get a quantitative estimate of the completeness of our sample we performed tests with artificial variables for fields 104b and 104e .",
    "results of test for field 104b should apply also to the fields 104a and 104c because all three fields contain similar numbers of measurable stars and were observed with comparable frequency .",
    "similarly , results for field 104e should apply to field 104d . for both fields we selected 5 samples of objects from sets of stars",
    "whose light curves were examined for variability .",
    "the brightest sample included stars with @xmath40 and the faintest sample included stars with @xmath41 .",
    "a total of 100 stars were selected at random from each sample .",
    "the observed light curves of these stars were then interlaced with the synthetic light curves of model contact binaries .",
    "the synthetic light curves were generated using a simple prescription given by rucinski ( 1993 ) .",
    "two separate cases were considered .",
    "case  i  a contact binary with the inclination @xmath42 and the mass ratio @xmath43 .",
    "case  ii  a contact binary with the inclination @xmath44 and the mass ratio @xmath45 . in both cases",
    "the so called `` fill - out - parameter '' was set to @xmath46 .",
    "the light curves corresponding to case - i and case - ii show depths of primary eclipses equal to 0.15 and 0.32 mag , respectively . for each of the artificially generated light curves a period was drawn in a random way from the range 0.2 - 0.45  d. also the phase for the first point of the given light curve was randomly selected .",
    "the simulated light curves were then analysed in the manner as the observed light curves .",
    "specifically , we applied a procedure based on the @xmath47 test .",
    "the number of artificial variables which were `` recovered '' for cases i - ii and 5 magnitude ranges is given in table 7 .",
    "it may be concluded that the completeness of our sample of contact binaries is better than 88% for systems with @xmath29 and depth of eclipses higher than 0.32 mag . for systems with full amplitudes as small as 0.15 mag",
    "the completeness is higher than 73% for @xmath48 .",
    "it has been noted by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997c ) that the frequency of occurrence of contact binaries in 47  tuc is very low in comparison with open clusters and with several globular clusters which have been recently surveyed for eclipsing binaries by various groups .",
    "however , results presented here are based on a larger sample of stars than the sample analyzed by kaluzny et al . (",
    "1997c ) . a more extended discussion of this topic is given in kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1997c ) .",
    "it is appropriate to note at this point that the low frequency of occurrence of contact binaries among 47  tuc stars was first suggested by shara et al .",
    "as a by product of our survey we obtained @xmath0 vs. @xmath7 cmd s for all 5 monitored fields . in fig .",
    "8 we show the cmd s for fields 104a and 104e . for each field",
    "the final photometry was obtained by merging measurements extracted from `` long '' and `` short '' exposures .",
    "photometry obtained for fields 104a - b extends to brighter magnitudes than photometry obtained for fields 104c - e .",
    "the frames used for construction of cmd s of monitored fields are listed in table 8 .",
    "any detailed analysis of these data is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note only that our data can be used to select candidates for cluster blue stragglers .",
    "all photometry presented in this section was submitted in tabular form to the editors of a&a and is available in electronic form to all interested readers ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the potential users of this photometry should be aware about possibility of some systematic errors of the photometry .",
    "these errors are most likely to be significant for relatively faint stars .",
    "the ccd chip used for observations by the ogle suffers from some nonlinearity .",
    "more details on this subject can be found in paper i.",
    "the main result of our survey is the identification of 8 contact binaries which are likely members of 47  tuc and 2 detached / semidetached binaries which are possible blue stragglers .",
    "particularly interesting is the bright binary oglegc228 . by combining radial velocity curves with photometry",
    "one would be able to determine an accurate distance to this system .",
    "that would in turn give distance to the cluster if the binary is indeed member of 47  tuc .",
    "we failed to identify any detached eclipsing systems among cluster turnoff stars .",
    "three such systems with periods ranging from 1.5 to 4.6 day were identified in our survey of @xmath2  cen ( papers i&ii ) .",
    "we identified 6 variables which are likely to be red giants belonging to the cluster .",
    "these stars exhibit modulation of luminosity with periods ranging from 2 to 36 days and full amplitudes in the @xmath0 band ranging from 0.08 to 0.18 mag .",
    "they may represent high - amplitude counterparts of low - amplitude variable k giants identified in the central region of 47  tuc by edmonds & gilliliand ( 1996 ) .",
    "this project was supported by nsf grants ast-9530478 and ast-9528096 to bohdan paczynski .",
    "jk was supported also by the polish kbn grant 2p03d-011 - 12 .",
    "we are indebted to kyle cudworth for sending us the astrometric data on 47  tuc .",
    "we thank ian thompson for his detailed remarks on the draft version of this paper .",
    "tables containing light curves of all variables discussed in this paper as well as tables with @xmath1 photometry for the surveyed fields are published by a&a at the centre de donnes de strasbourg , where they are available in electronic form : see the editorial in a&a 1993 , vol .",
