    "the dynamical density  matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite and the closely related correction  vector dmrg  @xcite have been widely used in the last decade to compute the dynamical correlation functions and spectral functions of low - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "@xcite although more powerful dmrg approaches have been developed recently ,  @xcite dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) often remains the method of choice because it offers two practical advantages over the other approaches : it is simpler and it can be easily parallelized .",
    "for instance , it has been recently shown that ddmrg allows us to investigate features with small spectral weights such as power - law pseudo - gaps in luttinger liquids .",
    "@xcite the main drawback of ddmrg is that it always yields the convolution of the desired spectrum with a lorentzian distribution of finite width .",
    "therefore , the true spectrum can only be obtained through a deconvolution of the ddmrg spectrum .",
    "( in principle , there are some methods to get around this problem  @xcite but they are rarely used in practice . )    deconvolution is a typical ill - conditioned inverse problem , however .",
    "@xcite a direct solution of the deconvolution equation usually yields a very noisy and thus useless spectrum . nevertheless , various regularization methods have been successfully used to deconvolve ddmrg spectra for one - dimensional systems and quantum impurity problems .",
    "@xcite astonishingly , some of these deconvolution methods even allow us to bypass the finite - size scaling analysis and to obtain the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite systems directly from a broadened finite - system ddmrg spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , regularization also smooths out the sharp features of the true spectrum .",
    "this is a serious issue as the spectra of one - dimensional systems and quantum impurities often exhibit very interesting ( power - law ) singularities .    in this paper",
    "we present a method , which allows us to determine sharp spectral features in the thermodynamic limit starting from a broadened finite - system ddmrg spectrum . for this purpose",
    "we consider the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit and the deconvolution for the lorentzian kernel to be a single blind deconvolution ,  @xcite i.e.  an inverse problem with an unknown kernel including both the lorentzian broadening and the finite - size effects . the key idea to preserve sharp spectral features in a piecewise smooth spectrum is to impose a minimal distance @xmath0 between extrema of the deconvolved spectrum . to illustrate our method we investigate the single - particle density of states ( dos ) of one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators represented by the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "@xcite we confirm that this dos has the step - like onset predicted by field - theoretical studies  @xcite at least at weak to intermediate coupling up to @xmath1 .",
    "the hubbard model  @xcite with on - site interaction @xmath2 and nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath3 is a basic lattice model for the physics of strongly interacting electrons , in particular the mott metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite at half filling ( i.e. , the number of electrons equals the number of sites @xmath4 ) the ground state is a mott insulator for strong interaction @xmath5 , while it is a fermi gas in the non - interacting limit @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is defined by @xmath7 where the operator @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath10 on the site @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the first sum runs over all pairs @xmath14 of nearest - neighbor sites while the other two sums run over all sites @xmath15 .",
    "here we will only consider half - filled systems and thus set the chemical potential @xmath16 to have electron - hole - symmetric spectra and a fermi energy @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk single - particle dos @xmath18 can be measured experimentally using photoemission spectroscopy or scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "theoretically , it can be defined as the average of the local dos @xmath19 where the sum runs over both spins and all sites @xmath15 in the lattice , while @xmath20 is the local single - particle dos at site @xmath15 for spin @xmath10 and can be calculated using @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath26 and @xmath27 their eigenenergies in the fock space .",
    "the ground state for the chosen number of particles corresponds to @xmath28 . the total spectral weight is @xmath29 we will consider only lattice geometry for which the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the electron - hole transformation @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for half filling the density of states is symmetric , @xmath31 . if the system is translation invariant , the bulk dos and the local dos are identical . for dmrg simulations , however , open boundary conditions are preferred to periodic boundary conditions . in this case",
    ", the bulk dos can be identified with the local dos on one of the two equivalent middle sites of the system , i.e.  as far as possible from the system boundaries .",
    "inverse problems such as ( blind ) deconvolutions  @xcite occur in many scientific fields and are among the most challenging numerical computations .",
    "experimental measurements and computer simulations often yield approximations of the true quantities which are measured or computed , respectively .",
    "it is often assumed that the deviations from exact results can be modelled by a convolution with a smoothing function and an additive noise due to the finite accuracy and resolution of the measurement or simulation process .",
    "a typical example of a blind deconvolution is the reconstruction of an original signal from a degraded copy using incomplete information about the degradation process .",
    "@xcite here we want to compute sharp spectral features in the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite system from a broadened finite - system spectrum calculated with ddmrg . in this section",
    "we first show that this task can be formulated as a blind deconvolution problem , then present an algorithm for solving it .",
    "let @xmath32 be a spectrum of a finite lattice model with @xmath4 sites .",
    "this spectrum is a dirac - comb ( a finite sum of dirac - peaks ) @xmath33 where the sum runs over all hamiltonian eigenstates @xmath25 which contributes to the spectrum , i.e.  with a nonzero spectral weight @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 denotes the corresponding excitation energies .",
    "this spectrum can be broadened with a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath36 @xmath37 to obtain a smooth spectral function @xmath38 with the ddmrg method we can calculate this spectrum for a discrete set of excitation energies @xmath39 . as numerical calculations are always affected by errors , ddmrg actually yields values @xmath40 which are related to the true spectral function by @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents the unknown errors .",
    "( it should be noted that ddmrg errors @xmath43 include significant systematic contributions , for instance due to the variational nature of the procedure .",
    "@xcite ) in principle , one could determine the true spectrum , i.e. , the excitation energies @xmath35 and the corresponding weights @xmath44 , through this system of equations . in practice",
    ", however , this is an ill - conditioned problem except for simple discrete spectra .",
    "moreover , we are not interested in resolving the discrete peaks of small systems but in calculating the piecewise smooth spectra of macroscopic systems .",
    "the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath45 note that , generally , the order of the two limits can not be exchanged .",
    "typically , the spectral function @xmath46 is piecewise smooth , i.e. , it exhibits one or more continua as well as isolated sharp features such as steps , power - law singularities or cusps . in principle",
    ", one should carry out several ddmrg simulations with varying system size @xmath4 and broadening @xmath36 and then extrapolate the numerical data to obtain @xmath46 . in most cases ,",
    "a simultaneous extrapolation for @xmath47 and @xmath48 is possible  @xcite using a constant value of @xmath49 .",
    "nevertheless , the computational cost of ddmrg simulations increases very rapidly with smaller @xmath36 and the overall cost of this approach is prohibitive for a full spectrum .",
    "indeed , this approach has been mostly used to study isolated spectral features in the thermodynamic limit such as power - law singularities and steps .",
    "@xcite    as all operations used to define @xmath46 from @xmath50 are linear , the broadened spectrum of the finite system can also be written explicitly as a function of the infinite system spectrum @xmath51 the kernel @xmath52 includes both the finite - size effects and the lorentzian smoothing .",
    "its form is not known but it is clear that we must recover a pure lorentzian smoothing in the thermodynamic limit @xmath53 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deconv ] ) and  ( [ eq : spec - inf ] ) we obtain a system of equations @xmath54 for @xmath55 , relating the ddmrg data set @xmath56 to the infinite system spectrum @xmath46 .",
    "determining @xmath46 from these equations is a so - called inverse problem .",
    "@xcite this kind of problem is also called blind deconvolution since our knowledge of the kernel is incomplete .",
    "[ strictly speaking , it is not a deconvolution because eq .",
    "( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) is not a convolution .",
    "however , as the kernel approaches the form @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit , we will use the terminology of deconvolution problems . ]",
    "it should be obvious that this is an ill - posed problem .",
    "first , the errors @xmath43 and the kernel @xmath52 are not known .",
    "second , the problem is sorely underdetermined as we try to reconstruct the function of a continuous variable from a finite number @xmath58 of data points .",
    "finally , a convolution with a lorentzian is a smoothing operation and thus the corresponding deconvolution is an extremely ill - conditioned inverse problem : the solution will be extremely sensitive to small changes or errors in the input .",
    "various deconvolution methods have been used successfully to deduce piecewise smooth spectra from the broadened finite - system spectra calculated with ddmrg .",
    "they include , direct inversion at low resolution ,  @xcite linear regularization methods ,  @xcite fourier transform with low - pass filtering ,  @xcite nonlinear regularization methods such as the maximum entropy method ,  @xcite parametrization with piecewise polynomial functions ,  @xcite and a deconvolution ansatz for the self energy .",
    "@xcite however , this task has not been viewed as a blind deconvolution so far .",
    "instead , it has been considered as the deconvolution of a perfectly known kernel .",
    "the need for regularization or filtering techniques has been viewed as the consequence ill - conditioning and under - determination of the problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) with a lorentzian kernel .",
    "all of these methods offer some advantages for particular spectral forms . however , their common drawback is that they are ill - suited for sharp spectral features , such as steps or power - law singularities , within or at the edge of a continuum .",
    "either the regularization procedure smooths out true sharp features excessively or it allows the occurrence of deconvolution artifacts ( artificial sharp structures , rapid oscillations or negative spectral weight ) , especially in the vicinity of the true spectrum singularities .",
    "naturally , better results can be obtained if we can use _ a priori _ knowledge about the properties of the spectrum  @xcite but , in practice , this is a rare occurrence .",
    "therefore , we need a better method for solving the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) which allows us to determine isolated sharp spectral features accurately while preserving the positivity and the piecewise smoothness of @xmath46",
    ".    let the ddmrg data ( [ eq : dmrg - data ] ) be evenly distributed in the energy interval @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the difference between two consecutive energies is @xmath60 .",
    "additionally , consider a set of equidistant energies @xmath61 in the interval @xmath62 \\subset [ \\epsilon_a,\\epsilon_b]$ ] .",
    "the distance between these energies is @xmath63 . as we will always use @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 .",
    "( typical values are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ) as in a least - square approach we define a cost function @xmath68 as the sum of the squares of the differences between the ddmrg data and an approximate representation parametrized by a discrete set of variables @xmath69 @xmath70 the absolute minimum of @xmath68 is zero and the corresponding parameters @xmath71 are determined by a linear system of @xmath58 equations @xmath72 using this equation system to determine the parameters @xmath71 would be an unconstrained least - square fit .    in the limit @xmath73 ( followed by @xmath74 and @xmath75 )",
    "this equation system becomes equivalent to the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) with vanishing errors @xmath76 .",
    "thus the absolute minimum of @xmath68 yields the spectrum @xmath46 through @xmath77    if we substitute a lorentz kernel @xmath78 for the unknown kernel , @xmath79 in  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) , we recover the finite - system deconvolution problem defined by equations  ( [ eq : spec - finite ] ) and  ( [ eq : deconv ] ) for vanishing errors @xmath43 .",
    "thus the absolute minimum of the cost function corresponds to the discrete finite - system spectrum @xmath32 through @xmath80 if @xmath81 and @xmath82 otherwise .",
    "physically , the solution of the deconvolution problem is unique for vanishing errors @xmath43 and thus the cost function should have a unique absolute minimum . from a mathematical point of view , however , the equation system  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) could have no solution or infinitely many solutions . then any small error @xmath43 can generate wildly different ( and mostly unphysical ) solutions .    therefore , as  ( [ eq : kernel - limit ] ) holds in the thermodynamic limit , it is possible and preferable to obtain a reasonable approximation of the infinite - system spectrum @xmath46 from the minimization of the cost function  ( [ eq : cost - function ] ) with a lorentz kernel under the constraint that the spectral function @xmath46 is physically allowed .",
    "for instance , @xmath46 should be positive semidefinite and piecewise smooth .",
    "generally , this solution does not correspond to the absolute minimum or even a local minimum of @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , the solution of the inverse problem  ( [ eq : inverse - problem ] ) corresponds to the value @xmath83 if we assume that the relation  ( [ eq : solution ] ) holds .",
    "of course , it could be possible to lower the cost function with other configurations @xmath84 but in that case the relation  ( [ eq : solution ] ) would no longer hold .",
    "note that , this idea has been implicitly assumed in all previous deconvolution schemes of ddmrg data aiming at piecewise smooth spectra so far .",
    "however , in these approaches the agreement between solution @xmath84 and numerical data @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear - system ] ) with a lorentzian kernel is considered essential while the regularization of the solution and the errors @xmath43 are seen as perturbations which should deteriorate the agreement as little as possible .    yet a blind deconvolution requires equal balancing of the agreement between solution and numerical data and of the smoothness and stability of the solution .",
    "@xcite hence we must take a different point of view : the lorentzian kernel  ( [ eq : kernel - limit ] ) is only an approximation of the true kernel @xmath52 and the physical constraints on the deconvolved spectrum @xmath46 are essential in the minimization of the cost function . thus we accept significant deviations of @xmath84 from the conditions  ( [ eq : linear - system ] ) yielding the absolute minimum of the cost function , or , equivalently , we assume that the errors @xmath43 can be substantial .      therefore , the blind deconvolution problem can be formulated as a least - square optimization under non - linear constraints .",
    "we want to minimize the cost function  ( [ eq : cost - function ] ) with the lorentz kernel under the constraints that the spectrum @xmath46 has the following properties :    1 .",
    "finite band width , i.e @xmath86 for all @xmath87 and all @xmath88 for some finite @xmath89 , 2 .",
    "positive semi - definite , @xmath90 , and 3 .",
    "piecewise smooth .",
    "the first two conditions are easily expressed for the parameters @xmath91 .",
    "the somewhat fuzzy concept of a piecewise smooth spectrum must now be formulated more precisely . in principle",
    ", we wish that @xmath46 is piecewise continuous and that the distance between discontinuities is larger than a minimal energy difference @xmath0 .",
    "as we must work with a finite number @xmath92 of points @xmath93 , we only have a discrete representation of @xmath46 and we have to formulate a `` continuity '' condition for the discrete set of variables as well .",
    "therefore , we require that the distance between two significant extrema is larger than a parameter @xmath94",
    ". two neighboring extrema at energy @xmath95 and @xmath96 are significant if there relative height difference is larger than a parameter @xmath97 , @xmath98 this condition can easily be formulated for the parameters @xmath91 .",
    "the minimal extremum distance @xmath0 must be chosen carefully .",
    "it should be smaller than the distance between actual singularities in the spectrum @xmath46 but a too small value allows many artificial peaks in a deconvolved spectrum . in practice , we have found that we can obtain reasonable solutions to the blind deconvolution problem which look piecewise smooth using @xmath99 . in all examples discussed in this paper",
    "every local extremum is considered to be significant ( i.e. , we have used the precision of floating - point arithmetic @xmath100 ) .",
    "the cost function is minimized iteratively .",
    "iterations are repeated until the procedure converges .",
    "each iteration consists in two steps . in the first step",
    "the cost function @xmath101 is minimized with respect to each variable @xmath102 successively .",
    "this minimization under constraint does not present any difficulty as @xmath101 is a second - order polynomial in each variable @xmath103 . in the second step , we first find the positions @xmath104 of all significant extrema pairs in @xmath105 which are separated by less than a distance @xmath0",
    ". then we interpolate the data @xmath105 linearly from @xmath106 to @xmath107 to smooth out the spectrum around the extrema . in doing",
    "so we take care to preserve the total spectral weight @xmath108 the search for extrema and their smoothing is repeated until there is no more close significant extrema in @xmath109 .",
    "then we start the next iteration . by design the first step results in a decrease of @xmath101 .",
    "the second step nearly always results in an increase of @xmath101 . without the second step , however , we would perform an under - determined ( @xmath110 ) deconvolution devoid of any regularization mechanism and thus obtain a completely useless result .",
    "typically , we observe a rapid and monotonic decrease of @xmath101 in the initial iterations followed by a saturation or oscillations in further iterations .",
    "therefore , we monitor the changes in the parameters @xmath103 and the normalized cost function @xmath111 to determine converged configurations @xmath71 .",
    "convergence requires typically @xmath112 to @xmath113 iterations depending on the quality of the ddmrg data and the complexity of the spectrum .",
    "finally , the solution @xmath91 can be smoothened using a narrow lorentzian distribution to obtain a continuous function @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "alternatively , we can use a gaussian distribution  @xcite of width @xmath116 .",
    "the second approach yields sharper ( real or artificial ) features because the tail of a gaussian distribution decreases faster than that of the lorentz distribution . as our minimization problem possesses many local minima , the final results @xmath71 depend somewhat on the criteria for convergence . however , if the final smoothening function is broad enough , the differences are canceled out .",
    "if the ddmrg data  ( [ eq : dmrg - data ] ) are not evenly distributed in the interval @xmath59 $ ] or if they already exhibit numerous close extrema , it is useful to regularize them before starting the deconvolution iterations using an interpolation and the smoothening procedure described above .",
    "the computational effort required by this procedure is negligible compared to the computational cost of the ddmrg simulations yielding the original data .",
    "( our code in the programming language c contains less than 400 lines of instructions and the deconvolution of one spectrum takes less than 30 minutes on a single cpu . )",
    "therefore , we have not bothered to optimize the algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , it should be implemented in such a way that it only requires @xmath117 operations rather than the @xmath118 operations of a straightforward implementation .",
    "the method described here can be generalized in several ways .",
    "for instance , it is possible to use a variable spacing @xmath119 of the ddmrg data points , such as a finer mesh close to sharp spectrum features .",
    "however , this does not seem to improve the results in practice because the broadening parameter @xmath36 , not @xmath119 , is the limiting scale .",
    "a generalization to variable @xmath36 and @xmath119 , as proposed in ref .   for quantum impurity problems , should also be possible but we have not tested it yet . to introduce information about the variation of the spectrum with @xmath36 one could combine ddmrg data obtained for different values of @xmath36 by defining an overall cost function as the sum of the cost functions for each @xmath36 .",
    "these generalizations will be tested in future works .",
    "as an illustration of our deconvolution procedure we discuss its application to the dos of one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators .",
    "the nature of mott insulators is a long - standing open problem in the theory of strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "@xcite in a paramagnetic mott insulator quantum fluctuations or frustration of the antiferromagnetic spin exchange coupling prevents the formation of a long - range magnetic order .",
    "experimentally , non - magnetic mott insulators have been found in layered organic insulators  @xcite as well as in quasi - one - dimensional cuprate chains  @xcite and ladders  @xcite . despite decades of extensive research the properties of mott insulators , in particular their single - particle dos , are still poorly understood and thus actively investigated .",

    "however , the dos can not be calculated directly from the bethe ansatz .",

    "actually , higher - order corrections indicate  @xcite that some spectral weight is present below the peak at @xmath184 on a scale set by the effective spin exchange coupling @xmath185 .",
    "this width is compatible with our deconvolved spectra for @xmath186 .",
    "thus our numerical results agree at least qualitatively with strong - coupling perturbation theory and suggest that the square - root divergences in the dos  ( [ eq : dos - scpt ] ) is an artifact of a truncated strong - coupling expansion .",
    "nevertheless , for strong coupling such as @xmath177 we are not able to determine the shape of the dos at the onset @xmath172 . in particular",
    ", it is not clear if the field - theoretical prediction  ( [ eq : dos - ft ] ) is still valid . indeed ,",

    "the spectrum consists in a single band with two clearly visible square - root singularities at the band edges @xmath195 . for weak coupling @xmath127",
    "the band splits into two symmetric hubbard bands separated by a gap @xmath128 , which agrees perfectly with the charge gap calculated from the bethe ansatz solution . at the dos onsets",
    "@xmath196 the spectrum exhibits the step - like behavior  ( [ eq : dos - ft ] ) predicted by field theory .",
    "@xcite there is an apparent plateau between the onset and a strong first peak , which evolves from the square - root singularities at @xmath195 for @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , we observe substantial spectral weight and a small second peak at higher excitation energy .",
    "however , for weak enough @xmath127 most of the spectral weight lies between the spectrum onset and the first peak .    as @xmath127 increases ( compare the spectra for @xmath160 and @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : onedim ] ) , the spectrum and all its features shift to higher excitation energy and the spectral weight becomes more concentrated between the visible peaks . in addition , we note that the separation between onset energy @xmath142 and the strong first peak becomes systematically smaller until it is no longer resolvable with our method , the peak separation increases monotonically from about @xmath197 for @xmath198 to approximately @xmath199 for @xmath200 , and the strength of both peaks become more equal .    comparing the dos with the momentum - resolved spectral function and the bethe ansatz dispersion ( see figs . 4 and 5 in ref .  )",
    "we note that the strong first peak corresponds to the edge of the spinon branch at momentum @xmath201 , the weak second peak corresponds to the edge of the holon branch at @xmath202 , and the upper edge of the dos spectrum coincide with the edge of the single spinon - holon continuum .",
    "finally , we do not observe any spectral weight outside the first lower and upper hubbard bands and these two bands account for the full spectral weight  ( [ eq : sum ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that higher - energy hubbard bands do not carry any spectral weight in the bulk single - particle dos .",
    "we have presented a blind deconvolution procedure which allows us to obtain piecewise smooth spectral functions for infinite - size systems from the ddmrg spectra of finite systems .",
    "it involves a trade - off between the agreement of the deconvolved spectrum to the original ddmrg data and the piecewise smoothness and positivity of spectral functions . in practice",
    ", the method reduces to a least - square optimization under non - linear constraints which enforce the positivity and piecewise smoothness .",
    "we have tested this deconvolution method on many spectra which are known exactly in the thermodynamic limit , such as the single - particle density of states and the optical conductivity of correlated one - dimensional insulators .",
    "@xcite we have found that our method works well for several kinds of singularities ( e.g.  power - law band edges , steps , excitonic peaks ) in piecewise smooth spectra . in particular , it allows us to reduce the broadening by orders of magnitude and even to substitute the lorentzian broadening by a gaussian one .",
    "its main drawback is the frequent appearance of artificial shoulder - like structures on energy scales @xmath203 .",
    "we have demonstrated the deconvolution procedure on the single - particle dos in the one - dimensional hubbard model at half filling .",
    "our results show that the dos has a step - like shape but no square - root singularity at the spectrum onset in agreement with a field - theoretical prediction for one - dimensional paramagnetic mott insulators .",
    "@xcite in addition , the deconvolution procedure has allowed us to detail the evolution of the dos from the non - interacting limit @xmath6 to the strong - coupling limit @xmath180 .",
