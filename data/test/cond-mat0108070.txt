    "in the family of frustrated magnets , the kagom and pyrochlore lattices have attracted special attention both experimentally and theoretically . experimentally such magnets display a wide variety of unusual low temperature behaviors @xcite signatures of different kind of collective low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "the first - neighbor classical heisenberg model on such lattices has a t=0 entropy @xcite . on these lattices ,",
    "the heisenberg model can be rewritten as the sum of the square of the total spin of corner sharing units @xmath2 ( triangles for the kagom lattice , tetrahedra in the pyrochlore ) :    @xmath3    thus a classical ground - state is obtained whenever @xmath4 for all @xmath2 .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that such ground - states have a continuous local degeneracy .",
    "thermal fluctuations select planar spin configurations on the kagom lattice @xcite , but are unable to build order from disorder in the pyrochlore lattice@xcite .    a simple",
    "maxwellian counting has been done by the last authors : the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath5 heisenberg spins with a given length is @xmath6 . the number of constraints to realize a classical ground - state is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of spins on each @xmath2 unit .",
    "assuming that these constraints are linearly independent  , one finds a @xmath9 extensive entropy ( @xmath10 ) for the pyrochlore and zero entropy ( @xmath11 ) in the kagom case .",
    "although the assumption is known to fail for the kagom magnet this naive counting suggests that the degeneracy of the classical ground - state in the pyrochlore magnet is larger than in kagom magnet , in qualitative agreement with the thermal behavior of the two magnets .    lately",
    ", palmer and chalker have studied the heisenberg problem on the checker - board lattice@xcite .",
    "this lattice built out of corner sharing 4-spin squares ( see fig .  [ checkerboard2 ] ) is the two dimensional analog of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the classical heisenberg model on the checker - board lattice has a similar ground - state degeneracy and behave the same way at low temperature ( and with additional dipolar interactions)@xcite .",
    "the effect of quantum fluctuations on these different structures remains to be fully understood . in the large s , first - order spin - wave approximation",
    ", all these magnets remain disordered@xcite .",
    "higher order approximations have been devised for the kagom lattice and lead to selection of order out of disorder by quantum fluctuations@xcite .",
    "there is no spin long range order ( lro ) in the pyrochlore magnet@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of low lying excitations of the spin-1/2 kagom magnet obtained from exact diagonalizations has been a real surprise@xcite : whereas it probably has a small gap for @xmath12 excitations ( transitions @xmath13 ) , there is no gap to singlet excitations ( transitions @xmath14 ) and the density of low lying @xmath15 states is so large that the system has a t=0 residual entropy .",
    "the discovery of a second model with a similar spectrum of low lying excitations on the triangular lattice with 4-spin exchange interaction lead us to speculate that this could be a generic new type of magnets@xcite .",
    "a natural question thus arises : do the 2-dimensional and the true pyrochlore quantum magnets belong to this generic class ?",
    "the results obtained from their classical and semi - classical counterparts support the speculation that the answer might be positive ! as exact diagonalizations are up to now limited to systems of @xmath16 spins , the problem of the true spin-1/2 pyrochlore magnet might remain open for still a long time .",
    "the 2-d pyrochlore looks more promising : palmer and chalker@xcite have computed the spectra of clusters up to @xmath17 spins . from their results , they were able to conclude that the system has no nel lro ; it does not break @xmath18 at @xmath9 and probably has a large spin gap . yet",
    "these sizes were not large enough to be sure that this magnet was really in the same class as the kagom magnet . in this work",
    "we extend such diagonalizations up to @xmath0 .",
    "the technical aspects of these diagonalizations have been previously described@xcite .    besides these diagonalizations in the full hilbert space",
    ", we also have peformed diagonalizations in the restricted space of first neighbor dimer coverings ( denoted in the following fnss , for first neighbor singlet subspace ) .",
    "the size of this restricted subspace is smaller than the @xmath15 sector of the full hilbert space and it increases slower with the system size ( @xmath19 compared to @xmath20 ) . in this restricted basis",
    "we have studied samples up to @xmath1 .",
    "the fnss calculations for @xmath1 have required an order of magnitude less of computer memory than the full hilbert space calculations for @xmath0 .",
    "as usual , periodic boundary conditions are applied to the samples .",
    "spectrum of the heisenberg model in the full hilbert space .",
    "energy per spin in the ground - state @xmath21 and energy gaps @xmath22 between the @xmath23 energy level of the @xmath24 spin sector and the @xmath25 level of the @xmath26 sector .",
