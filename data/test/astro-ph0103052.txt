    "the young star clusters in the antennae have effective radii @xmath0  pc and masses of the order @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "these clusters are not evenly distributed but themselves clustered in super - clusters spanning regions of several hundred pc in projected diameter and have concentrated cores , i.e. the cluster - density in the centre of the super - cluster is higher than in the outer parts .",
    "the richness of the super - clusters spans from groups of only a few to super - clusters containing hundreds of new star clusters .",

    "( their numerical models show that the system is seen at approximately 100  myr after the closest approach of the interacting pair . )",
    "this so - called tidal dwarf galaxy ( tdg ) contains old and new stellar material , a lot of gas and also undissolved massive stellar clusters .",
    "systems like the merger remnant ngc  7252 ( miller et al .",
    "1997 ) show a distribution of young massive star clusters which has the same age as the interaction ( @xmath4  myr ) .",
    "all these observations show that galaxy interactions lead to the formation of new massive and compact star clusters .",
    "finally , galaxies like our milky way host several dwarf galaxies ( e.g. dsph or de ) ( mateo 1999 ) with high specific globular cluster frequencies ( grebel 2000 ) and globular clusters in their tidal streams .    with this project",
    "we investigate the future fate of clusters of young massive star clusters . according to kroupa ( 1998 )",
    "it is possible that such configurations merge and build a dwarf galaxy .",
    "therefore we simulate compact super - clusters in the tidal field of a host - galaxy and investigate the influence of orbital and internal parameters on the rate and timescale of the merging process ( i.e. how fast the single clusters merge and how many star clusters are able to survive this process ) .",
    "in addition the properties of the resulting merger object and its dynamical evolution are studied .",
    "a detailed description of the properties of the merger objects will be given in a follow up paper .",
    "the simulations are performed with the particle - mesh code superbox ( fellhauer et al . 2000 ) . in superbox densities",
    "are derived on cartesian grids using the nearest - grid - point scheme . from these density arrays",
    "the potential is calculated via a fast fourier - transformation .",
    "the particles are then integrated forward in time using a fixed time - step leap - frog algorithm .",
    "superbox has a hierarchical grid architecture which includes for each object two levels of high - resolution sub - grids .",
    "these sub - grids stay focused on the objects and travel with them through the simulation space , providing high resolution at the places of interest ( in this case the super - cluster and the single clusters within ) .",
    "the massive star clusters are simulated as plummer - spheres containing 100,000 particles each , having a plummer - radius of @xmath5  pc and a cutoff radius @xmath6  pc .",
    "each cluster has a total mass of @xmath7 and a crossing time of @xmath8  myr .",
    "the super - cluster is also modelled as a plummer distribution made up of @xmath9 star clusters described above , has a plummer - radius @xmath10 and cutoff radius @xmath11 .",
    "the plummer - radius of the super - cluster has values of 50 , 75 , 150 and 300  pc . in this project",
    "the number of clusters is kept constant at @xmath12 , which is a typical number of star clusters found in these super - clusters .",
    "@xmath9 was chosen small enough to get results with a considerable amount of cpu - time .",
    "higher values of @xmath9 will be dealt with using the newly available parallel version of superbox in the near future . in our calculations",
    "the super - clusters have an initial velocity - distribution according to the plummer - distribution we gave them ( i.e. they are initially in virial equilibrium ) .",
    "the super - cluster orbits through the external potential of a parent galaxy , which is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14  kpc and @xmath15  km / s .",
    "we refer the reader to kroupa ( 1998 ) , who describes the isolated case .",
    "the centre of the super - cluster moves on a circular orbit at distance @xmath16 around the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the distance @xmath16 from the galactic centre is varied to be 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 and 100  kpc .",
    "the tidal radius @xmath17 of the super - cluster depends mainly on @xmath16 , but has also a low dependency on @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath17 lies at the local maxima of @xmath18 .",
    "it can be derived numerically by setting @xmath19 where @xmath18 is @xmath20    the grids in this project are chosen to have @xmath21 mesh - points with the following sizes :    * the innermost grids cover single star clusters and have sizes ( @xmath22 ) of 60  pc .",
    "this gives a resolution of 1  pc per cell .",
    "* the medium grids have sizes ( @xmath23 ) approximately equal to the cut - off radius of the super - cluster ( @xmath24 ) to ensure that every star cluster is in the range of the medium grid of every other cluster .",

    "5 ) with @xmath32 being the half - mass radius of a plummer - sphere ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 we obtain @xmath35 using @xmath36 from this expression instead of @xmath37 in our eq .  [ eq : mergrateareas ] we obtain the dotted curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : mtime ] &  [ fig : ctime ] .",
    "we note that this ansatz does not lead to a good description of our results .",
    "it leads to an @xmath38 dependency of @xmath39 , which is steeper than we find in our simulations . also",
    "the merger theory of makino & hut ( 1997 ) does not agree with our results .",
    "they find a dependency on @xmath38 with a power of 1.5 , which does not fit our data . in our simulations",
    "we find a very weak dependency of the merging timescales on the parameter @xmath38 . for our main parameter range ( @xmath40 )",
    "there is even no visible dependency .",
    "the simulations show a clear exponential decrease of the number of clusters with dimensionless time @xmath41 independent of the choice of @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mtime ] ) .",
    "therefore , a merger theory depending on the merging of single clusters must be wrong .",
    "the mean projected distance of clusters inside the innermost plummer radius of the super - cluster depends only on the choice of @xmath9 and is given by @xmath42 numerical simulation shows that @xmath43 is given by 0.53 .",
    "since half the star clusters lie within one projected plummer radius , we get for our choice of @xmath44 @xmath45 comparing this value with the merger radii @xmath37 for our choices of @xmath38 ( see table  [ tab : infrad ] ) one can see that in the centre of the super - cluster the mean distance between two clusters ( within the innermost plummer - radius @xmath46 ) is comparable the merger radius for most @xmath38 . in the centre",
    "the clusters are not able to separate from each other right from the beginning and the merging of them should therefore happen very quickly within one or two crossing times of the super - cluster , especially for high @xmath38 .",
    "in this case we have to deal with a big merger object covering the central area of the super - cluster .",
    "merging happens preferably with this central object .",
    "therefore , our ansatz for @xmath47 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mergrateareas ] fails .",
    "instead we use the following ansatz shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : an2 ] .",
    "the merging cross - section @xmath47 is now a fraction @xmath48 of the area of the whole super - cluster @xmath49 @xmath50 which has to be determined . inserting in eq .",
    "[ eq : ansatz1 ] ( @xmath51 ) and integrating leads to @xmath52 the exponential decrease , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : ndecr2 ] , is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : mtime ] as the solid lines .",
    "there one sees clearly that the number of clusters first decreases exponentially .",
    "one should also notice that the merging timescale is now independent of the choice of @xmath38 .    after all clusters travelling through the centre have merged with the central merger object , the further decrease of @xmath53 with time levels off .",
    "this is due to the fact that even if @xmath54 there is the chance that some clusters escape and as a second effect there are clusters on rather circular orbits which do not travel through the central area . in low @xmath38 cases ( @xmath55 ) these clusters do not merge but their orbits will decay on timescales of the dynamical friction .    to prove the independency on @xmath38 we consider two characteristic quantities , namely the mean merger rate within the first crossing time ( @xmath56 ) and the half - life merging time ( @xmath57 ) , i.e. the dimensionless time until @xmath58 of the clusters have merged .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] shows the number of clusters merging within the first crossing time , and the time it takes to merge half the clusters .",
    "all simulations with the same @xmath38 , and which have @xmath59 , are binned together .",
    "as can be seen , there is no dependency on @xmath38 .",
    "the mean merger rate within the first crossing time and the mean half - life merging time derived from our simulations are given by @xmath60\\\\     t_{1/2 } & = & 4.18 \\pm 0.35 \\ [ t_{\\rm cr}^{\\rm sc } ]    \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] and are also displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] . inserting this values in our ansatz ( eq .  [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) for the merging times gives @xmath61    fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] shows the mean values of @xmath62 and @xmath57 for all combinations of ( @xmath38 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is clearly visible that there is no dependency of the results on @xmath63 at all .",
    "it therefore seems that @xmath63 influences the number of clusters which are able to merge rather than the timescale of the merger process .",
    "we expect to obtain a change in the initial behaviour of the system if @xmath37 falls well below the mean projected distance of the clusters . for our choice of @xmath9",
    ", this should happen approximately for @xmath64 .",
    "then our first ansatz ( eq .  [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) should represent the system . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath38 becomes higher than @xmath65  0.2 , the mean distance of all clusters is smaller than the merger radius ",
    "all @xmath9 star clusters should then merge within one or two crossing times . to prove this behaviour we performed test calculations without tidal field .",
    "the results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ctime ] ) show nicely the transition between these three regimes .",
    "the upper left panel is a simulation with @xmath66 and one sees clearly that almost all clusters merge within the first two crossing times . in the lower right panel",
    "a simulation with @xmath67 is displayed .",
    "the number of clusters decreases according to our @xmath38-dependent theory .",
    "the number of clusters , @xmath68 , which end up in the merger object shows no significant dependency on @xmath38 and @xmath63 , as long as the super - cluster configuration is well inside it s tidal radius ( i.e. @xmath69 ) . in this case",
    "almost all clusters merge and only one or two clusters sometimes survive by chance . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate ] , @xmath68 is close to @xmath70 .",
    "this changes if @xmath63 becomes larger than 1 .",
    "there is a significant drop in @xmath68 which also shows a weak @xmath38-dependency .",
    "we interpret this result as follows : we start with eq .",
    "[ eq : nofc ] and neglect the rare case of an escaping merged cluster here . if @xmath63 is small ( @xmath71 ) tidal effects are not dominant , and the evolution of @xmath72 is determined by the merger processes alone as discussed before . if @xmath73 there is a trend that clusters can leave the super - cluster before participating in the merger events .",
    "the number of escaping clusters depends on how many clusters initially are outside the tidal radius and on the individual velocities of such clusters . with only 20 clusters initially for the entire super - cluster any statistics of the subset of escaping clusters",
    "is extremely poor .",
    "their number strongly depends on the random numbers used for the initialisation of the system . keeping in mind this poor statistical weight of our data , we nevertheless identify two physically reasonable trends in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrate ] : first , the larger @xmath63 , the smaller the number of merging clusters , and second , this trend is more pronounced for small @xmath38 .",
    "this result is consistent with the picture that strong tidal fields lead to more escapers ( i.e.  less clusters available for merging ) ; if , however , the individual clusters are relatively extended ( larger @xmath38 ) , the merging competes with the escape ; clusters on orbits of potential escapers could be captured in the central regions by merging with a higher probability .",
    "binning the simulations in 5 @xmath63-bins , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : betafit ] , shows that the dependency on @xmath63 is linear . as best - fit for the data of our simulations we calculate @xmath74    to advance that kind of reasoning to an extreme , we could compare our results with the findings of baumgardt ( 1998 ) , who models the escaping stars from star clusters .",
    "he proposes a @xmath75-dependency .",
    "our results are consistent with baumgardt s results , in particular for @xmath76 in which case @xmath77 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ndecr1 ] ( where @xmath78 was neglected ) , so that @xmath79 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : nofc ] ) .",
    "note , however , that our particle number is very small compared to that work .",
    "the formation scenario of the merger object depends on the chosen @xmath38-value .",
    "one finds that with high values of @xmath38 , one has overlapping star clusters at the centre right from the beginning , and the simulation already starts with a merger object in the centre of the super - cluster . with decreasing values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the merger - tree starts with the merging of clusters at different positions in the super - cluster .",
    "afterwards , these merger objects sink to the centre and merge together .",
    "the exact details of the merging depend however on the starting conditions , and there can always be cases with high @xmath38 behaving like low @xmath38 and vice versa .",
    "[ fig : sd05a ] and  [ fig : sd24e ] show some snapshots of the evolution of clusters with high and low @xmath38-values .",
    "since the crossing - time of the super - cluster expressed in physical units depends on its size and therefore on @xmath38 , the merger rates , if expressed in myrs , also depend on @xmath38 : large @xmath38-values correspond to compact clusters which merge within a few tens of a myr , while small @xmath38-values correspond to extended clusters in which it can take up to 1 gyr until all clusters are finally merged .",
    "after 20  myr almost every cluster has already fallen into the merger object at the high @xmath38 simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd05a ] ) . at @xmath80",
    "myr only the last single cluster can be seen ( as a disturbance in the contours ) merging with the main object .",
    "in the low @xmath38 simulation ( fig .  [ fig : sd24e ] ) almost every cluster is seen as an individual object , even after 100  myr .",
    "after 1  gyr the merger object is surrounded by clusters which are still in the process of merging .",
    "these clusters may account for a high specific cluster frequency of the merger object .",
    "not shown in the last snapshot are the 2 escaping clusters travelling on the same orbit around the galaxy as the merger object .",
    "the merger objects show an exponential density distribution with exponential scale - length @xmath81  pc and follow a de - vaucouleur surface density profile with line - of - sight velocity dispersions about 20  km / s .",
    "a detailed description and analysis of our merger - objects is subject of fellhauer ( 2000 ) and a follow - up paper .",
    "here we merely briefly note that our merger objects fall in the region between dwarf galaxies and globular clusters in the central surface brightness ",
    "absolute magnitude diagram ( fig .  3 in ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "such objects evolve into dsph - like systems in a periodic tidal field ( fig .  13 in kroupa 1997 ; fig .  2 in kroupa 1998b ) .",
    "more massive and extended merger - objects can , of course , be obtained by suitable choices of @xmath10 and @xmath82 , but we defer a more detailed discussion of this to the future .",
    "we have performed a set of self - consistent dynamical models of clusters of twenty gas - free star clusters , as they have been recently observed in the antennae galaxies . for all our models , a central merger object formed out of a large fraction of the single clusters . as long as the super - cluster is smaller than its tidal radius ,",
    "almost all clusters merge .    for our choice of parameters",
    "( 5  kpc @xmath83 100  kpc and 300  pc @xmath84 1.8  kpc ) the merger process does not depend significantly on the two main dimensionless parameters of the problem , the tidal field strength relative to the super - cluster concentration ( @xmath63 ) and the relative concentration of the super - clusters and the individual clusters ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the cluster merging process can not be modelled by a sequence of two - body merger events , but is a `` collective '' interaction , where the first passage ( `` encounter '' ) of a cluster through the dense central region of the super - cluster leads to the assimilation into a growing merger object .",
    "the timescale of the merging process is the same ( measured in internal crossing times of the super - cluster @xmath85 ) for all models .",
    "measuring time in years shows that high @xmath38 calculations form the merger object within very short times ( @xmath86  myr ) , while for extended clusters ( low @xmath38 ) this process can take up to 1  gyr or even longer .",
    "while for very strong tidal fields the tidal mass loss as e.g. discussed by baumgardt ( 1998 ) dominates and merging processes are suppressed , and for the limit where the individual clusters approach point masses the merging is suppressed as well , our parameter range , which is consistent with the observations , always allows for the quick merger scenario on a few crossing time scales . tidal mass loss is only a secondary effect for part of our parameter space ( stronger tidal field ) due to a slight reduction of the number of clusters available for merging .",
    "the number of merged clusters @xmath68 decreases linearly with @xmath63 if @xmath63 becomes larger than 1.0 .",
    "we do not claim that our process of forming dwarf galaxies is the only possible way how these objects form , but at least it is one possible way to explain the existence of low - mass dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of large `` normal '' galaxies like our milky way .",
    "in addition , some `` side - effects '' can be explained by our models .",
    "it takes very long until all clusters finally end up in the merger object for low values of @xmath38 .",
    "such systems could account for a high specific globular cluster frequency found in dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "our models develop tidal tails which spread along the orbit of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "surviving escaped star clusters are also found on the orbit .",
    "this is similar to what is observed for the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "part of this project ( parallelisation of the code , use of high - performance computing power ) was carried out at the edinburgh parallel computing centre ( epcc ) by the tracs - programme .",
    "the tracs - programme is a scheme of the european community ( access to research infrastructure action of the improving human potential programme ; contract no hpri-1999-ct-00026 ) which allows young phd- or post - doc scientist to learn parallel computing , offering computing time and support for their projects .",
