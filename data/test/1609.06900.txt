    "the two innermost layers of the its and the v0 detector ( scintillation hodoscopes covering the forward pseudo - rapidity region on either side of the interaction point ) are used for triggering .",

    "moreover , in the context of blast wave model , it has been shown that spectra for k@xmath0 and @xmath3 are well predicted using parameters from a simultaneous fit to @xmath6 , k@xmath7 and p spectra in high multiplicity and collisions .",
    "this is also true for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in collisions , while in collisions they can not be described in a common freeze - out scenario , as they would require a lower mean transverse flow velocity and a higher kinetic freezeout temperature to be described properly .",

    "rhic the strangeness enhancement has been studied looking at the ratio between the yield in collisions and those in pp interactions at the same energy normalized to the mean number of participants ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "it has been shown that this is not the ideal way to isolate the enhancement component due to strangeness content , since the production rates of charged particles do not scale linearly with @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "it is shown that the predictions from statistical hadronization models using a chemical freezeout temperature of 156 mev @xcite are comparable with the ratios measured in the most central collisions for all the three particles . looking at the data , an increase of the ( multi-)strange baryon - to - meson ratios with multiplicity is observed . the increase is seen to be more pronounced for particles with a larger strangeness quantum number . in particular ( @xmath21)/@xmath6 and @xmath22/@xmath6 ratios",
