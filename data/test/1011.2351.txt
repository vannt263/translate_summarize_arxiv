    "the semiclassical equations of motion play a fundamental role in the transport theory for particles in crystal lattices , being them electrons in metals and semiconductors @xcite , or ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing predictions , is the occurrence of bloch oscillations when an additional constant force is present @xcite . despite being hardly detectable for electrons in natural crystal lattices as predicted in @xcite , bloch oscillations",
    "have been observed in a variety of systems , like electronic semiconductor superlattices @xcite , optical waveguide arrays @xcite , and ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "long - lived bloch oscillations have been observed both with thermal clouds @xcite and with non - interacting degenerate fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite loaded in sinusoidal periodic potentials under the effect of gravity , whose behavior is well described by the original semiclassical prediction @xcite .",
    "however , quantum mechanics has implications leading beyond the standard semiclassical approximation @xcite . in particular , for cyclic variations of the parameters , as is the case for bloch oscillations in quasi - momentum space , phase dependent effects can be present , as shown in the seminal work by m. berry @xcite .",
    "the importance of berry s phase in the wave packet dynamics in periodic potentials was recognized by chang and niu @xcite , who derived a set of corrections to the semiclassical equations of motions by means of an effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "the whole set of corrections are now generally called berry corrections or berry terms @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", anomalous transport may occur in case of parity - breaking potentials , in two and three spatial dimensions .",
    "anomalous effects can be present even in one - dimensional systems , provided that bloch bands are also subjected to slowly - varying time - dependent perturbations , as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of berry corrections on the bloch oscillations in one - dimensional ( 1d ) time - dependent parity breaking potentials .",
    "in particular , we consider the dynamics of a non interacting wave packet in a 1d periodic potential , in the presence of an additional constant force , as can be obtained for instance with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice subjected to gravity @xcite .",
    "since in 1d berry terms may appear only when parity is broken and in the presence of time - depending bands @xcite , we consider a potential composed by two shifted sinusoidal potentials with commensurate wavelengths , whose amplitudes are modulated in time @xcite .",
    "we find that parity breaking affects significantly the band structure , already in the static case .",
    "then , in the presence of time - modulations , bloch oscillations may be dramatically modified owing to the presence of the anomalous velocity term in the semiclassical equations . by direct comparison with the full solution of the schrdinger equation ,",
    "we show that these corrections of the semiclassical equations fully accounts for the center of mass dynamics of the wavepacket .",
    "we also characterize how the anomalous effects depend on the degree of parity breaking of the potential and on modulation parameters .",
    "finally , we discuss how the effects of the anomalous velocity can be measured from time - of - flight measurements in current experiments with non - interacting bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices , in the presence of gravity .",

    "let us consider a quantum particle of mass @xmath0 , represented by a wavepacket @xmath1 , in a one dimensional periodic potential @xmath2 of period @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "owing to the bloch theorem , the system eigenfunctions can be written as @xmath5 , the @xmath6 s having the same periodicity of the potential . consequently , the energies are restricted within energy bands @xmath7 , that are periodic in the quasimomentum @xmath8-space with period @xmath9 , @xmath10 .    at the semiclassical level",

    "this holds even when the band structure is modulated in time , provided the variations are adiabatic .",
    "in particular , in the presence of an additional constant force @xmath13 , and within the one - band approximation ( we drop the index @xmath14 ) , the evolution of the wavepacket centers is described by the semiclassical equations @xcite @xmath15 where the berry vector potential @xmath16 and scalar potential @xmath17 in ( [ eqmoto1 ] ) are defined as @xcite @xmath18 with the prefactor @xmath19 coming from the standard normalization of @xmath20 s in the unit cell , @xmath21 , at each time @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we recall that zak - berry phase @xmath23 is defined as the integral over the first brillouin zone of the vector potential @xmath16 @xcite @xmath24    according to eq .",
    "( [ eqmoto2 ] ) , the quasimomentum center @xmath12 moves linearly across the first brillouin zone , @xmath25 being the time needed to scan the full zone . the dynamics in real space is instead determined by the velocity term in the right side of in eq .",

    "the anomalous velocity can be cast into the form @xmath28 that is manifestly vanishing for stationary potentials . in that case",
    "the wavepacket performs the usual bloch oscillations , of period @xmath29 and amplitude @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the energy bandwidth . instead , in the case of time dependent parity - breaking potentials ,",
    "the effects of the anomalous velocity may become relevant , as we discuss in the following .",

    "we will consider the specific case of gravity , @xmath37 .",
    "we also notice that the length @xmath38 , and the corresponding energy scale @xmath39 , represent two natural scales for the system , and it is therefore useful to rewrite eqs .",

    "the typical shape of the potential is shown in fig .",

    "here we are mainly concerned with the single band approximation , and in the following we will refer to the ( dimensional ) bandwidth @xmath31 of the lowest band as _ the bandwidth _ , and to the ( dimensional ) minimal energy gap @xmath47 between the first and second band as _ the gap_.    as for the parameters , we choose typical values of the experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath48 .",
    "then , @xmath49 is chosen in the range @xmath50 in order to have - at least in the case of a static primary lattice alone - clean bloch oscillations ( no drifts ) , large band gap ( in order to conform to the single band approximation ) , and large enough oscillation amplitudes ( i.e. large enough bandwidths @xmath31 ) .",
    "the latter condition is obtained by considering @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , the lower bound @xmath52 guarantees that the ratio of the recoil energy to the gravitational energy is above the critical value for having no drift , @xmath53 .",

    "this suggests that the maximal effects of the anomalous terms in the dynamics should be expected for these values of @xmath56 , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "in addition , we find that the zak - berry phase is almost independent of @xmath73 , and slightly decreases as @xmath62 is increased .",
    "this analysis reveals that the control of the phase @xmath56 is rather a crucial issue for commensurate bichromatic lattices , since the band properties have a strong dependence on it .",
    "this may become even more relevant in higher dimensions , where parity breaking alone ( no need for time - dependent bands ) is sufficient for producing anomalous terms in the semiclassical equation of motions or other effects related to the berry phase @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the dynamical behavior of the system , by considering the evolution of an initial wavepacket under the effect of a constant force , and in the presence of a modulation of the periodic potential .",

    "as anticipated , the combined effect of parity breaking and time modulation gives rise to an anomalous velocity term in the semiclassical equation for the center of mass dynamics in real space , see eq .",

    "the importance of this term can be analyzed by comparing the evolution of @xmath79 obtained from the full solution of the schrdinger equation , with that predicted by the semiclassical equations ( [ eqmoto1])-([eqmoto2 ] ) @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "let us separate the trajectory of the wave packet center into two parts @xmath80 the first coming from the time integration of the `` normal '' velocity in eq .",

    "<S> we also discuss how to measure the effects of the anomalous velocity in current experiments with non - interacting bose - einstein condensates in bichromatic optical lattices , under the effect of gravity . </S>"
