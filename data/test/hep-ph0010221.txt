    "the idea of a statistical approach to hadron production in high energy collisions dates back to 50s @xcite and 60s @xcite and it has been recently revived by the observation that hadron multiplicities in collisions agree very well with a thermodynamical - like ansatz @xcite .",
    "this finding has also been confirmed in hadronic collisions and it has been interpreted in terms of a pure statistical filling of multi - hadronic phase space of assumed pre - hadronic clusters ( or fireballs ) formed in high - energy collisions , at a critical value of energy density @xcite . in this framework , temperature and other thermodynamical quantities have a statistical meaning which does not entail the existence of a thermalised hadronic system on an event - by - event basis .",
    "stated otherwise , statistical equilibrium shows up only when comparing many different events , whilst in each of them the gibbs law of equally likely multi - hadronic states applies .",
    "so far , this proposed statistical cluster hadronisation model has been mainly tested against measured abundances of different hadron species for a twofold reason .",
    "firstly , unlike momentum spectra , they are quantities which are not affected by hard ( perturbative ) qcd dynamical effects but are only determined by the hadronisation process ; indeed , in the framework of a multi - cluster model , they are lorentz - invariant quantities which are independent of the cluster s overall momentum .",
    "secondly , they are quite easy to calculate and provide a very sensitive test of the model yielding an accurate determination of the temperature . however , in order to establish the validity of this approach , it is necessary to test further observables and to assess their consistency with the results obtained for multiplicities .",
    "certainly , one of the best suited observables is the transverse momentum of identified hadrons , where transverse is meant to be with respect to beam line in high energy hadronic collision , and thrust or event axis in high energy collisions .",
    "indeed , such projection of particle momentum is supposed to be the most sensitive to hadronisation or , conversely , the least sensitive to perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "+ actually , it has been known for a long time that transverse momentum distributions are boltzmann - like in hadronic collisions and this very observation was pointed out by hagedorn as a major indication in favour of his statistical model of hadron production @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the prediction of a thermal - like shape in principle only applies to particles directly emitted from the hadronising source , whereas measured spectra also include particles produced by decays of heavier hadrons .",
    "however , most analyses do not take into account the distortion of primordial hadronisation spectrum due the to hadronic decay chain and try to fit the data straight through it .",
    "this problem has been discussed in literature @xcite and an analytical calculation has been developed to take into account the effect of two and three body decays @xcite , which has then been used both for pp @xcite and heavy ion collision @xcite including most abundant resonances . in this paper",
    "we introduce a method allowing to rigorously and exhaustively determine the contribution of all particle decays .",
    "hence , by taking advantage of this technique , we have performed an analysis of many measured transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons in a wide range of centre - of - mass energies for several kind of collisions .",
    "the statistical hadronisation model @xcite assumes that in high energy collisions , as a consequence of strong interaction dynamics , a set of colourless clusters ( or fireballs ) is formed having certain values of mass , volume , internal quantum numbers and momentum , the latter being inherited from the hard stage of the process .",
    "those clusters are assumed to give rise to hadrons according to a pure statistical law in the multi - hadronic phase space defined by their mass , volume and quantum numbers .",
    "this approach differs from another popular cluster hadronisation model @xcite mainly because it gives clusters a volume so that hadron production is ruled by the properly understood phase space rather than relativistic momentum space . in this framework",
    ", the use of statistical mechanics and thermodynamical quantities , such as temperature , which need spacial dimension besides momentum space in order to be meaningful , is allowed .",
    "we emphasize once more that the introduction of such quantities does not entail any thermalisation process of hadrons after their formation , nor the existence of a thermalised system event by event . +",
    "although many clusters with different momenta , volumes , masses and quantum numbers are formed , it can be shown that the average values of many observables , e. g. particle multiplicites , are the same as those relevant to one equivalent cluster having suitable values of volume ( namely the sum of all cluster volumes measured in the rest frame of the equivalent cluster itself ) , mass and quantum numbers ( namely the sum of all cluster quantum numbers ) .",
    "the proof of this statement @xcite , a lengthy one , requires the assumption of special probabilities governing the fluctuations of cluster masses and quantum numbers for a given set of volumes .",
    "if the volume ( or mass ) of the equivalent cluster is large enough , it is then reasonable to take a canonical approach ( i.e. introducing a temperature ) in order to calculate mean quantities , instead of carrying out an involved microcanonical calculation .",
    "therefore , even though actual clusters are small sized and microcanonical calculations would be needed to determine mean quantities within each of them , the choice of suitable mass fluctuation probabilities for the clusters allows one to calculate overall means dealing with only one large global structure and with much fewer parameters . arguing the other way around , it is not difficult to be convinced that the fluctuation probabilities to be chosen in order to achieve such reduction of the problem are exactly the same as those of obtaining a given set of masses by splitting a large cluster into a given number of clusters with volumes @xmath2 .",
    "this statement extends a reduction procedure to the microcanonical case which was proved in the canonical case @xcite , where , from the very beginning , clusters were given temperature and volume instead of mass and volume .",
    "nevertheless , it is not obvious how large the equivalent cluster should be for the canonical approximation to apply . for the present",
    ", we have adopted a simple - minded _ a posteriori _ method consisting in justifying the canonical framework by its capability of accordance with the data .",
    "a simple argument to support the canonical approximation even at moderate values of volumes is the very large number of states ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. hadrons and resonances , which can be excited in a hadron gas . +",
    "as far as single - particle transverse momentum spectra are concerned , a similar reduction theorem from many clusters to one equivalent cluster in the averaging procedure applies @xcite , though only approximately . in general",
    ", it can be shown that the _ primary _ spectrum of @xmath4 hadron species depends on transverse four - velocities @xmath5 with vanishing longitudinal component . ] of the @xmath6 clusters :    @xmath7     \\ ; f(u_{t1},\\ldots , u_{tn } ) \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\times \\ ; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\d n_j}{\\d p_t}\\vl_{i}(\\ui ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the transverse four - velocities distribution function .",
    "if one expands all single - cluster spectra @xmath9 in series of @xmath10 starting from a common value @xmath11 for all clusters , it can be proved that , at the zeroth order , the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) becomes the same as that obtained for the aforementioned equivalent cluster , endowed with a tranverse four - velocity @xmath11 .",
    "this reduction possibly allows taking the canonical approach in order to calculate the transverse momentum spectrum since the equivalent cluster size is much larger than single cluster s :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the temperature , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are modified bessel functions .",
    "( [ two ] ) is the boltzmann limit of quantum statistics and it is a very good approximation for all hadrons except pions @xcite . for the zeroth order approximation in the @xmath10 expansion to be sufficiently accurate , the involved transverse four - velocities should be small , i.e. @xmath17 already for @xmath18 . since it is possible to choose the starting point @xmath11 of the series expansion to make the first order term vanishing @xcite , the largest neglected term turns out to be @xmath19 which is very small provided that the aforementioned condition on @xmath20 is met .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper assumes the validity of this approximation and primary spectra have been calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) . +",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) looks like the spectrum from a thermalised source with a superimposed flow , a popular formula in the heavy - ion community , it is well worth emphasizing that in fact this formula has nothing to do with flow .",
    "indeed , the average transverse four - velocity @xmath11 is not meant to be the mean value of cluster velocity distribution in a single event ; rather , it is the average transverse four - velocity of all clusters over all collision events . in other words ,",
    "@xmath11 may well arise from single clusters emitted at high @xmath21 in some events , e.g. following a hard parton scattering , and does not imply by any means a collective event - by - event expansion .",
    "gev @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath22 spectra ( above ) have been normalised so as to have the same value at @xmath23 .",
    "while slopes of @xmath22 spectra are different , those of @xmath24 ( below ) are approximately the same for all identified particles . ]",
    "a peculiar prediction of a statistical picture in high energy collisions which is relevant to transverse momentum spectra is the so - called @xmath25 scaling : there should be an apparent common slope for @xmath26 spectra of identified hadrons at a given centre - of - mass energy . by looking at eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) one can easily realize that this holds in the limit @xmath27 . in principle",
    ", @xmath25 scaling applies only to primary hadrons , namely those directly emitted from the hadronising source . on the other hand , as stated in sect .",
    "1 , most observed or reconstructed particles in experiments arise from decays of heavier hadrons .",
    "those secondary decays may well distort the primary spectrum shape , thus spoling @xmath25 scaling .",
    "nevertheless , it can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ mtslope ] ) that @xmath25 scaling apparently also holds for measured final hadrons , at least in the examined collision , implying seemingly little distortion from primary to final spectrum . settling this and",
    "other related issues demands a thorough analysis taking into account the effect of decays .",
    "therefore , measured @xmath21 spectrum of the @xmath4 hadron species should be compared with the sum of its primary spectrum and the contribution arising from all heavier hadrons decaying into it :    @xmath28    whilst @xmath29 is given by eq .",

    "( [ three ] ) within a statistical - thermal framework is a very complicated problem as the number of contributing resonances and decay modes is huge and also owing the presence of cascade decays ( e.g. @xmath30 ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite an analytical approach has been taken including two and three body decays of directly emitted resonances .",
    "on the other hand , we have adopted @xcite a mixed numerical - analytical method which allows a very accurate and exhaustive calculation .",
    "our method can be summarised as follows : for any couple of hadrons @xmath31 , where @xmath32 decays into @xmath33 , either directly or through a cascade process , we have determined the momentum spectrum @xmath34 in the equivalent cluster s rest frame via a monte - carlo method by randomly generating 200,000 @xmath32 s decays , according to phase space , by picking @xmath32 s three - momenta from a thermal distribution with a given temperature @xmath14 :    @xmath35    then , we have boosted the obtained @xmath34 distributions in order to compute the @xmath36 for a given transverse four - velocity @xmath11 of the equivalent cluster , to be plugged into eq .",

    "the monte - carlo generation of @xmath34 spectra , depending on the temperature , has been performed for all unstable hadrons and resonances up to a mass of 1.8 gev and it has been repeated for temperature values between 140 and 190 mev in steps of 1 mev , so as to have a large enough range of temperatures where to search for minima in a fitting procedure .",
    "for any other temperature value , the spectra have been calculated by means of a linear interpolation .",

    "this procedure amounts to exclude the overall normalisation dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath14 in the fit so to keep only its shape dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "+ whilst the @xmath41 parameter has already extensively been used in multiplicity fits @xcite , a new parameter is introduced here for the strangeness suppression .",

    "the mean value of the poissonian distribution , namely the mean value of newly created pairs , is the adjustable fit parameter . for the present , this new parametrisation has been used only for hadronic collisions ( see table 1 ) because collisions present difficulties related to the production of heavy flavoured quarks which makes calculations extremely slow .",

    "( [ eecont ] ) along with @xmath14 bands obtained from multiplicity fits and resulting @xmath43 s minima .",
    "it can be seen that no minimum is found within the band for collisions at @xmath72 gev , a situation looking very similar that found in k@xmath48p collision at @xmath49 gev .",
    "it is also found that fitted @xmath11 increases quite rapidly with centre - of - mass energy reflecting the rise of average @xmath21 of gluon radiation . since our parametrisation of transverse momentum spectra with an average transverse four - velocity @xmath11 requires @xmath11 to be @xmath73 ( see discussion in sect .",
    "2 ) , it is quite natural that fit quality deteriorates as centre - of - mass energy increases .",
    "this is indeed found already at 44 gev where @xmath74 can not longer be considered small .",
    "as energy increases , particle @xmath21 spectra become sensitive to the shape of clusters @xmath75 distribution ( related in turn to radiated gluon @xmath21 spectrum ) and not only to its mean value .",
    "further on , they become dominated by the shape of gluon radiation spectrum whilst hadronisation @xmath21 plays the role of a small superimposed noise .",
    "the analysis of transverse momentum spectra of several identified hadrons , accurately taking into account the effect of hadron decays , indicates that they can be well reproduced within the statistical hadronisation model for several high energy hadronic collisions .",

    ", this finding is a strong indication in favour of one of the key predictions of the statistical hadronisation model , namely the existence of a close relationship between the laws governing the production of particles as a function of their mass and , for each particle species , the production as a function of momentum ( measured in the rest frame of the cluster they belong to ) at the hadronisation .",
    "+ besides this main conclusion , there are many remarks to be made .",
    "first of all , our calculations assumed a canonical framework and so they are expected to have only a limited validity at low centre - of - mass energies where the effect of exact transverse momentum conservation must show up .",
    "indeed , in collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of 14 gev and k@xmath48p collisions at 11.5 gev , a clear disagreement is found between the temperatures determined in the two fashions ( see fig .",
    "( [ kpcontlow ] ) ) . secondly ,",
    "whilst the results obtained in pp collisions for different particles are in very good agreement among them , there are some significant discrepancies between different particles in @xmath45p and k@xmath48p collisions , especially for k@xmath71 s , which are not understood at the present .",
    "finally , it is evident in the analysis of moderately high energy collisions , at @xmath47 44 gev , that our parametrisation of transverse momentum spectra as a function of an average transverse four - velocity alone , is not accurate enough . as the average @xmath21 of radiated gluons and , as a consequence , of hadronising clusters , rises ,",
    "particle spectra are influenced more by the shape of clusters transverse four - velocity spectrum than by primordial hadronisation @xmath21 spectrum so that more accurate calculations are needed involving perturbative qcd to perform such an analysis .",
    "finally , in the very high energy regime , @xmath21 spectra become insensitive to hadronisation and , as a consequence , it is no longer interesting to study its properties . in summary , the presently used parametrisation of @xmath21 spectra is found to work well only in a limited centre - of - mass energy range ( roughly between 20 and 30 gev ) . at lower energies , the study of @xmath21 is still of great interest in probing the statistical features of hadronisation but complex microcanonical calculations are required . at higher energy ,",
    "hadronisation is swamped by hard qcd dynamics in @xmath21 spectra and all it can do is to add a little smearing .",

    "<S> a detailed analysis is performed of transverse momentum spectra of several identified hadrons in high energy collisions within the framework of the statistical model of hadronisation . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the decay chain following hadron generation is accurately taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the considered centre - of - mass energies range from @xmath0 10 to 30 gev in hadronic collisions ( @xmath1p , pp and kp ) and from @xmath0 15 to 45 gev in collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a clear consistency is found between the temperature parameter extracted from the present analysis and that obtained from fits to average hadron multiplicities in the same collision systems . </S>",
    "<S> this finding indicates that in the hadronisation , the production of different particle species and their momentum spectra are two closely related phenomenons governed by one parameter . </S>"
