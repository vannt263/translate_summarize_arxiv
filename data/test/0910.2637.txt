    "microdevices tend to behave very differently from devices that are used in everyday life .",
    "surface tension effects are dominant at these scales , and micropumps and microvalves have been fabricated taking advantage of this principle@xcite .",
    "inherent in these technologies is the need to develop the fundamental science of small devices .    to understand the fluid dynamics in microflows",
    ", the classical navier - stokes equations can not be applied due to the breakdown of the continuum assumption .",
    "recent computer simulations apply molecular dynamics@xcite .",
    "however , these simulations are usually limited to some tens of thousands of particles , length scales of nanometers and time scales of nanoseconds@xcite . to overcome these shortcomings , mesoscopic simulation methods such as the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) are more applicable and",
    "have been recognized as a promising approach for simulation of microflows@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the macroscopic limit , the navier stokes equations can be recovered@xcite . however , most previous lbe models virtually correspond to the navier - stokes equations on the length scale of the lattice constant , and when these models are applied to near - continuum flows , the slip boundary conditions must be perfectly specified to capture possible boundary effects on the flow behavior .",
    "thus for the simulation of fluid flows with the lbe method , the development of slip - flow boundary conditions has been a critical issue .    in this paper",
    ", we use a recently proposed velocity boundary condition for the lbe that is independent of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial slip@xcite and thus simulate slip flows by the use of a parameter @xmath0 that defines the surface tendency to cause slip .",
    "thus we study flow past surfaces on which the slip length is modulated in stripes .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) is a numerical method to solve the boltzmann equation eq.([eq_boltzmann ] ) on a discrete lattice@xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation expresses how the probability @xmath1 of finding a particle with velocity @xmath2 at a position @xmath3 and at time @xmath4 evolves with time : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes an external body force , @xmath7 the gradient in position and momentum space , and @xmath8 denotes the bgk collision - operator@xcite .",
    "our simulation takes place on a 3-dimensional lattice .",
    "we use a d3q19 lattice with the vectors @xmath9 pointing to the various neighboring sites according to the index @xmath10 as explained in our previous work@xcite . note that we express all quantities in lattice units , i.e. , time is measured in units of update intervals and length is measured in units of the lattice constant .      on the wall boundary nodes , the distribution function assigned to vectors",
    "@xmath9 pointing out of the lattice move out of the computational domain in the propagation step , and the ones assigned to the opposing vectors are undetermined because there are no nodes which the distributions could come from . therefore , on the boundary nodes , special rules have to be applied .",
    "following@xcite , we interpolate by means of linear combination between the above two boundary conditions to study slip flows@xcite . the respective weight of the no - slip contribution and the full slip contribution is controlled through a slip parameter @xmath0 by the following general relation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the density probability function for flow with the partial - slip condition , @xmath13 denotes the density probability function of the no - slip boundary condition , and @xmath14 stands for the specular reflection boundary condition from which full - slip condition may be obtained .    for the no - slip boundary condition",
    ", we use the formulation presented recently by hecht and harting@xcite .",
    "this boundary condition is an explicit local on - site second order flux boundary condition for 3d lb simulations on a d3q19 lattice , which is independent of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial slip . for full - slip boundary condition ,",
    "specular reflection , as suggested in ref.@xcite , is used which implies no tangential momentum transfer to the wall .",
    "the slip parameter is defined such that at a value of zero , the no - slip boundary condition is applied , while at a value of one , the full - slip boundary condition is applied .",
    "thus , slip flows can be easily simulated by adjusting the value of @xmath0 between zero and one according to physical parameters such as the roughness and hydrophobicity of the surface .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we have shown that the partial slip boundary condition eq.([eq_slip_param ] ) shows a slip length which is independent of the shear rate .",
    "the slip length , measured in lattice units and obtained at a given value of the slip parameter , is independent of the channel width and of the density of the fluid .",
    "it depends linearly on the bgk relaxation time @xmath15 of the lb simulation .    by means of the slip parameter @xmath0",
    "the slip length @xmath16 can be adjusted in our simulation .",

    "we study the flow past patterned surfaces .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the case of stripes of equal width with alternating slip parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the effective slip length of the flow through such a channel is found to be a third order function of the slip length obtained from homogeneous walls , given by the form :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the slip length of the modified wall with stripes , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the slip lengths obtained for the homogeneous walls of the same slip parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , from eq.([eq_sliplen ] ) .",

    "consistent with the work by feuillebois  _",
    "etal._@xcite , we find that the maximum slip length is obtained when the stripes are aligned parallel to this force .",

    "the condition @xmath44 is maintained , leading to symmetry about @xmath45 . ]    in fig.[fig : sliplength_diag_fit ] we show the dependence of the effective slip length on the orientation of the force and on the choice of slip parameters applied on the stripes .",
    "for studying the angle dependence , the stripes have been constrained by the condition @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , the case of a homogeneous wall",
    "is restored and therefore , the slip length is independent on the angle @xmath39 between the force and the direction of the extension of the stripes .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chosen differently , the effective slip depends on the orientation . for @xmath48 ,",
    "i.e. if the force is aligned parallel to the stripes , a maximal slip length is obtained .",
    "if the stripes are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the force , a minimal slip length is obtained . out of those extreme cases",
    "the slip length for the orientations in between can be calculated from eq.([eq : bazant ] ) .",
    "we also find that in simulations with the force acting in diagonal direction , the fluid tends to follow the stripes on the wall .",
    "the velocity of the fluid shows a small component which is perpendicular to the force .",
    "this component can be understood as a consequence of the tensorial nature of the slip as proposed by bazant and vinogradova@xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "the transverse flux is four orders of magnitude less than the velocity obtained in the direction of the force . even though the effect is small",

    "the influence of such a wall design can be understood by plotting the velocity vectors along the wall , as shown in fig.[fig : velocitysideview ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that as @xmath0 tends to 1 , the velocity along such nodes is increased , and as @xmath0 tends to 0 , the velocity along such nodes is reduced . as a result the fluid arriving in a region where the slip length decreases has to go aside .",
    "hence the occurrence of a vortice in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the force driven flow may be observed . due to the varying slip conditions a varying direction of the velocity occurs along the @xmath25 direction .",
    "however , if averaged over all lattice planes a net flux in a vortex remains , as shown in fig.[fig : averaged ] .    in order to better quantify the influence of the pattern on the velocity profile",

    "our results confirm previous understanding that at a decreased angle ( stripes along the driving force ) the slip length increases .",
    "we further understand that if the stripes are oriented parallel to the force , the fluid can flow along the stripes and form lamellae of fluid with different slip according to the local surface properties on the respective stripe .",
