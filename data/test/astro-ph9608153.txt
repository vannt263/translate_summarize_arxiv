    "at the end of their life , stars of low- and intermediate - mass evolve along the asymptotic giant branch , where they experience recurrent thermal instabilities and substantial mass loss . during this phase ,",
    "the stars undergo a very rich and unique nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , recurrent dredge - up events enrich the stellar surface with the freshly synthesized nuclides which are then ejected into the interstellar medium through the strong winds .",
    "the thermally pulsing agb stars thus play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of galaxies .    on the other hand ,",
    "agb stars are important contributors to the integrated luminosity of stellar systems in a wide range of ages .",
    "a coverage of this phase is needed in particular for the treatment of the luminosity functions and color magnitude diagrams of star clusters .",
    "last but not least , the corresponding stellar models are basic tools to study carbon stars , oh / ir stars , planetary nebulae and their central objects ( white dwarfs ) .    in the last 15 years , extensive observational data has become available that changed and highly constrained the theoretical view of the agb evolution .",
    "most of the progresses came from magellanic cloud studies , which revealed for example the absence of very luminous carbon stars ( which were previously predicted to originate from stars with initial masses between 5 and @xmath5 ) , and the unexpected existence of relatively faint and lower mass carbon stars ( blanco et al .",

    "this so - called `` carbon star mystery '' ( iben 1981 ) has led to the concept of hot - bottom convective envelope burning ( iben 1975 ; sackmann et al . 1974 ; scalo et al . 1975 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1992 ) .",
    "this mechanism , which reconverts c - rich to o - rich envelopes and produces @xmath2 , was confirmed by the existence of lithium enriched agb stars ( smith & lambert 1989 , 1990b ; plez et al .",
    "1993 ; smith et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the other hand , the discovery , inside meteorites , of interstellar grains which have been formed in the wind of cool carbon stars ( see e.g. zinner et al .",
    "1991a ) , complemented the stellar abundance analysis , and brought crucial informations on agb star nucleosynthesis .",
    "in spite of important improvements , many important issues of agb evolution still remain to be addressed , observationally as well as theoretically .",
    "this paper is the first of a series aimed at examining all the physical processes that may induce abundance anomalies in the surface of evolved agb stars . in the present work",
    ", we specifically investigate the case of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "stars with initial masses between 3 and @xmath0 and with metallicities @xmath6 of 0.02 and 0.005 have been evolved , starting from the pre - main sequence until they had gone through a number of helium - shell flashes along the tp - agb .",
    "the @xmath0 ( 6 and @xmath0 ) stars with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) ignite off - center carbon burning and will not be discussed in detail .",
    "for each other stellar mass , full evolutionary models were computed up to the fourth `` full amplitude '' thermal pulse in the so - called `` asymptotic regime '' .",
    "synthetic evolution was then used to follow global surface properties and nucleosynthesis up to the planetary nebula ejection .",
    "this self - consistent and extended set of models is particularly relevant for population synthesis and chemical evolution models .",
    "very complete figures and tables containing informations about the center and surface evolution of the structure and chemical composition for all our models are available .    in the present computations , which include the latest input physics , the evolution of the chemical composition",
    "is followed by only taking into account nuclear reactions and mixing inside convective zones ( we assume instantaneous mixing , except when hot - bottom burning occurs , which requires a time - dependent convective diffusion algorithm ) .",
    "we neglect all other mixing mechanism of non - convective origin which may contribute to transport chemical elements in radiative regions , like rotation - induced mixing or diffusion . in the stellar mass range",
    "we consider , this approximation is supported by the observed surface abundances at different evolutionary stages .",
    "this is however certainly not the case for lower mass stars , for which some `` non - standard '' mixing processes have to be invoked to explain various chemical anomalies .",
    "the physical ingredients of our models and numerical aspects of the computations are presented in sects . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the general properties of the stars and their chemical evolution during the phases prior to the tp - agb one are summarized in sects . 4 and 5 , respectively .    in sect .",
    "6 , we briefly present the structural features of the thermal pulses and discuss the occurrence of the third dredge - up in our models .",
    "we derive a core - mass luminosity relation for our less massive stars that do not undergo hot - bottom burning .",
    "we then present the extrapolation procedure that we use to follow both the evolution and the nucleosynthesis in the  asymptotic regime \" up to the tp - agb tip .",
    "we also give the initial mass  final mass relation resulting from our models , that appears to be in good agreement with the observed one .    in sect .",
    "7 , we review the various nucleosynthesis sites inside tp - agb stars , namely the burning shells ( he , @xmath8 and h ) , the convective tongue that develops during a thermal runaway and the base of hot convective envelopes . we investigate in detail the nucleosynthetic processes that involve the li , cno , f , nena and mgal elements and neutrons .",
    "we then discuss which specific nuclear region , inside a tp - agb star , mainly contributes to the surface abundance change of each nuclide when a third dredge - up occurs .    in sect .",
    "8 , we finally present our predictions concerning _",
    "( i ) _ the evolution of all the surface isotopic ratios by including our evolutionary models and synthetic extrapolations up to the convective envelope removal and _ ( ii ) _ the chemical yields ejected at different ages for all the species up to @xmath9 . as in the previous sections ,",
    "comparisons between our predictions and observations are attentively performed .    in this paper version ,",
    "sects . 2 , 3 , 5 and 8 have been somewhat reduced .",
    "our equation of state is analytic .",
    "it includes    * the ionization of h , he , c , n and o. complete ionization is assumed when oix / oviii @xmath10 ; * the electrostatic corrections through the statistical model of debye - hckel for partially ionized regions and through the interpolation formalism of koester ( 1976 ) , between the debye - hckel and the thomas - fermi models , for the completely ionized matter ; * the electronic degeneracy as soon as its contribution to the total pressure exceeds @xmath11 ; * the production of neutrino pairs through four different processes , namely the photo - neutrinos , plasma neutrinos , @xmath12 pair annihilations and bremsstrahlung neutrinos .",

    ", we use the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) opacity tables , very well suited for cool red giant envelopes and atmospheres .    at temperatures above 8000 k",
    ", we use the opal opacity tables computed by rogers & iglesias ( 1992 ) . the abundance distribution of the heavy elements being scaled from the solar composition given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and updated by grevesse ( 1991 ) , as for low - temperature opacities .    for both sets of opacity tables ,",
    "we first interpolate bi - linearly in @xmath13 and @xmath14 for each table the composition of which is close to the model composition and then linearly in @xmath15 , @xmath6 ( and @xmath16o@xmath17 ) to obtain the right opacity coefficient corresponding to each shell .",
    "finally , we used the hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) program to generate conductive opacity tables corresponding to the same chemical compositions and @xmath18 grid points as for the opal tables .",
    "the stellar structure is integrated from the center to a very low optical depth ( @xmath19 ) in the atmosphere .",
    "we constraint the atmospheric temperature profile to correspond to those coming from realistic atmosphere models obtained by integrating the radiative transfer equation .",
    "more specifically , we use atmosphere models _ ( 1 ) _ from plez ( 1992 ) for @xmath20@xmath21 k , _ ( 2 ) _ from eriksson ( 1994 , private communication , using a physics similar to bell et al . 1976 ) up to 5500 k and _ ( 3 ) _ computed with the kurucz atmosphere program above 5500 k. at each time step , we linearly interpolate a @xmath22 profile corresponding to our model @xmath20 , @xmath23 and @xmath6 from these grids of atmosphere models and then correspondingly modify the radiative pressure and gradient .",
    "the structure of the convective regions is computed using the classical mixing - length theory ( mlt ) , as prescribed by kippenhahn et al .",
    "our models are standard in the sense that _ ( 1 ) _ the schwarzschild criterion is considered to delimit the convective zones and _ ( 2 ) _ neither overshooting nor semi - convection have been considered in the present computations .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 of the mixing - length free parameter over the pressure scale height has been put to a value of 1.5 , i.e. rather close to @xmath25 with which we fit the solar structure .",
    "> from the main sequence up to the thermally pulsing agb phase , we used the empirical reimers ( 1975 ) formula    @xmath26    with @xmath27 up to the central he exhaustion .",
    "> from the beginning of the agb phase , we adopted variable @xmath28 values , depending on the total mass of the star .",
    "more specifically , we took @xmath29 , 3 , 3.5 or 4 for our 3 , 4 , 5 or @xmath30 models respectively , whatever @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath28 increase with the total mass was found by bryan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to give rather good results along the agb .",
    "however , later during the thermally pulsing phase , blcker ( 1995 ) recently showed that the bryan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) formula underestimates the observed mass loss rate .",
    "this leads us to further increase @xmath28 ( see sect .",
    "however , as mentioned by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) , whatever empirical formula , the mass loss rate increase used in the models along the thermally pulsing agb phase still remain uncertain by more than a factor of two . as demonstrated in sect .",
    "8 , this important uncertainty on the mass loss rate formula conditions the agb phase duration and consequently , the surface composition evolution through the successive third dredge - up events .",
    "we note that along the thermally pulsing agb phase , the thermal pulse features slightly depend on the way one estimates the rate @xmath31 of gravitational energy release or gain ( see e.g. kippenhahn & weigert 1991 ) .",
    "so , let us specify that we wrote    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the specific ( i.e. by unit mass ) internal energy .",
    "we follow the abundance evolution , through the whole stars , of 45 nuclides , namely the neutrons , all the 31 stable nuclides up to @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "let us finally mention recent improvements not yet incorporated in our network : various @xmath95 reactions rates on light nuclei ( nagai et al .",
    "1995 ) and @xmath24 capture rates on @xmath96 by kppeler et al . ( 1994 ) .",
    "finally , the nuclear screening factors are parameterized by using the graboske et al .",
    "( 1973 ) formalism , including weak , intermediate and strong screening cases .",
    "neutrons can be produced during the thermally pulsing agb phase .",
    "they can , in particular , be captured by nuclides heavier than @xmath34 , mainly through @xmath95 reactions .",
    "as we do not follow the abundance of such elements , we created an additional nuclide , called @xmath97 , the mass fraction of which is set to    @xmath98    this sum counts in fact 253 stable nuclides up to @xmath99 . in order to have a good estimation of the free neutron abundance ,",
    "we follow a method described by jorissen & arnould ( 1989 ) .",
    "if nuclear reactions occur inside a convective zone , most of them proceed in general with a longer time scale than the turn - over time scale associated to the motion of convective cells . in such a case ,",
    "one usually consider the convective mixing as instantaneous .",
    "this allows to treat nucleosynthesis in one shot , by taking mass - weighted averages of the number abundances and nuclear reaction rates over the whole convective region",
    ".    however , if some key nuclides nuclearly evolve more rapidly than they are mixed , we have to consider the convection transport together with the nuclear reactions , so that nucleosynthesis equations become diffusion equations of the form    @xmath100 \\ , + \\ , \\makebox{nuclear terms } \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 , the ratio of the mass fraction over the atomic mass of each nuclide @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , the convective diffusion coefficient , with @xmath104 and @xmath105 being the mean velocity and turn - over time of the convective cells , respectively .",
    "it is very cpu time consuming to treat the nucleosynthesis and convective mixing together through such diffusion equations for each nuclide in each convective shell for all the time steps .",
    "consequently , as usual , instantaneous mixing has been assumed by default for our stellar evolution computations , except in two cases that potentially require a time - dependent treatment of the convective mixing : _ ( 1 ) _ the convective tongue associated with thermal pulses and _ ( 2 ) _ the base of the convective envelope when it is hot enough , both along the agb phase .",
    "we verified that inside thermal pulses , the elements that are the most affected by a diffusion treatment of the convective mixing are the very unstable nuclides ( like @xmath42 ) , neutrons and protons .",
    "however , this do not change very significantly the nucleosynthesis global results ( see however sect .",
    "7.5 ) .    on the contrary , the mean turn - over time scale of the convective motions is much longer inside the convective envelope than inside a thermal pulse .",
    "if nuclear burning occurs at the base of the convective envelope , some important nuclear reactions can , depending on the bottom temperature , occur faster than the convective mixing so that a diffusion treatment is required .",
    "this is in particular the case for some of the reactions involved in the @xmath2 synthesis ( see sect .",
    "7.2 ) .",
    "we have built initial models of 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and @xmath0 allowing us to start our computations at the beginning of the pre - main sequence phase ( along the hayashi track ) , when central temperatures are below @xmath106 k.    for our @xmath1 ( 0.02 ) models , the hydrogen mass fraction has been set to @xmath107 ( 0.687 ) and that of helium to @xmath108 ( 0.293 ) .",
    "the abundances of the heavier elements have been scaled on the anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) abundance distribution .",
    "we solve the five one - dimensional hydrodynamical equations for the evolution of the stellar structure with the mass coordinate as independent variable .",
    "we first convert the five non - linear stellar structure differential equations into difference equations following the henyey s scheme by defining discrete shells in mass .",
    "we then solve the resulting linearized system of equations by the newton - raphson relaxation procedure ( see e.g. press et al .",
    "typically , 600 shells are required for a model on the main sequence phase , while along the agb , 1000 to 1300 shells are needed ( 200 to 500 more shells being added during a thermal pulse ) .    on the other hand , typically 200 ( 700 ) models are necessary to model the central hydrogen ( helium ) burning phase .",
    "during the agb phase , 2500 to 4500 models are required to model the time separating two successive thermal pulses , while the thermal pulse itself requires 100 to 350 models .",
    "let us stress that these rather small numbers of mass shells and time steps have been chosen in order to save computer time and present a very large set of nucleosynthesis predictions .",
    "straniero et al .",
    "( 1996 ) very recently showed that this is probably in the disadvantage of the occurrence of the third dredge - up along the tp - agb phase .",
    "finally , the mass @xmath109 lost during each time step @xmath110 is suppressed proportionally to the shell masses of the whole envelope above the burning regions .",
    "the nucleosynthesis equations are solved using the wagoner ( 1969 ) numerical technique , well suited for our purposes . however , if a diffusion treatment is required to simultaneously compute the time - dependent convective mixing and the nuclear burning , the diffusion eqs .",

    "@xmath194 is quite low during the first thermal pulses , but it rapidly increases with core mass ( or flash number ) .",
    "the increasing rate is greater for lower metallicities or higher stellar masses .",
    "after typically 10 ( 5 ) thermal pulses in our @xmath195 ( 0.005 ) models , the thermal pulse intensity is very high and only slightly increases from pulse to pulse , monotonously with the core mass .",
    "this second part of the tp - agb phase is usually called the `` asymptotic regime '' or `` full amplitude '' of the thermal pulses .    for each of the modeled stars , we have computed at least four full amplitude thermal pulses .",
    "let us briefly discuss the main evolutionary properties of these thermal runaways .",
    "the thermal runaways are stronger inside stars of lower @xmath6 , which facilitates dredge - up events ( see sect .",
    "the intensities of our he - shell flashes are comparable to other published values for stars of about the same core masses ( see e.g. boothroyd & sackmann 1988b and table 4 ) .",
    "while the stars evolve along the tp - agb , the hebs and hbs advance in mass , and the mean inter - shell mass slightly decreases with time . from one pulse to another , the top of the convective tongue at its maximum extension gets closer from the hbs , even if contact between both regions has never been found due to the fact that the hbs is still active at that time .",
    "moreover , for all the thermal runaways we have computed , the overlap in mass between two successive thermal pulses is ranged between 0.6 and 0.4 for agb stars of increasing total mass .",
    "this overlap is slightly larger for our lower @xmath6 models .",
    "the maximum ( minimum ) temperature @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) and density @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) reached at the base ( top ) of a thermal pulse both increase ( decrease ) from pulse to pulse .",
    "for a given he - shell flash , @xmath196 increases with stellar mass and metallicity , while @xmath198 decreases with stellar mass but increases with metallicity . in the asymptotic regime",
    ", the growth rate of @xmath196 also tends to an asymptotic value . by comparison with other works for the @xmath111 ( z = 0.02 ) star",
    ", we found that our @xmath196 are typically 4 % higher than those of boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988b ) and straniero et al .",
    ". this could be mainly due to _",
    "( i ) _ different prescriptions to compute @xmath31 , _ ( ii ) _ different envelope masses due to different mass loss rates and _ ( iii ) _ different mlt treatments ( see sect .",
    "the temperature and density differences between the base and top of each convective tongue are rather large .",
    "this point is important for nucleosynthesis purposes ( see sect .",
    "the duration of the convective tongue associated with each thermal pulse ( @xmath200 ) and , to a lower extent , that of the inter - pulse phase ( @xmath201 ) , are crucial quantities for the nucleosynthesis too .",
    "the stronger a he - flash , the shorter it is and the quickest it deactivates .",
    "both quantities are thus smaller for higher core masses and lower metallicities .",
    "moreover , @xmath200 tends to decrease as the stars evolve along the tp - agb .",
    "@xmath201 also decreases after the first he - shell flashes , but it then reaches an almost constant value during the asymptotic regime , only very slightly decreasing with the increasing core mass .",
    "along the tp - agb phase , the bottom of the convective envelope can penetrate deep inside regions that have been nuclearly processed just after a thermal pulse , if it is strong enough ( in order to give rise to a large enough entropy increase in the inter - shell region ) .",
    "contrarily to the first and second dredges - up , this so - called third dredge - up , when it occurs , successively mixes up to the surface _",
    "( i ) _ material that has experienced h - burning in the thin hbs but also _ ( ii ) _ part of the region where the thermal pulse nucleosynthesis operated just before .",
    "both regions give rise to very different  and sometimes opposite  chemical pollutions of the convective envelope ( see sects . 7.1 and 7.6 ) .    in our @xmath7 models ,",
    "the hbs region is already dredged - up from the 14th , 5th and 3rd thermal pulse for the 3 , 4 and @xmath113 stars , respectively , while for the @xmath1 models , such a mixing already occurs from the 2nd and 1st thermal pulse for the 3 and @xmath112 stars , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) star with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) continuously mixes h - burning products up to the surface as it experiences h - burning at the bottom of its convective envelope ( the so - called `` hot - bottom burning '' or hbb ; see sect",
    "this kind of dredge - up already modifies the surface composition for some species ( like @xmath43 ; see sects .",
    "7.4 and 7.6 ) .",
    "the complete third dredge - up ( one usually simply calls the third dredge - up , 3dup hereafter ) , i.e. reaching the upper part of the previous thermal pulse region , is more difficult to obtain numerically . following models ( wood 1981 ; iben 1983 ; lattanzio 1987 ; boothroyd & sackmann 1988c ) , the dredge - up of thermal pulse material is easier for stars of lower metallicity @xmath6 .",
    "this is supported by observations ( see e.g. blanco et al . 1978 ) . in our models",
    ", we just found a 3dup from the 9th thermal pulse of the @xmath112 with @xmath1 star .",
    "however , based on the evolution of the post - thermal pulse entropy profile from pulse to pulse , we can predict that such a dredge - up will also occur , within the next two thermal pulses , for our 5 and @xmath30 stars with @xmath7 and for the @xmath113 star with @xmath1 ( see table [ endagb ] for the number of computed thermal pulses for each object ) .",
    "some additional thermal pulses are still needed for lower mass objects .",
    "several years ago , the 3dup was found to occur too late along the tp - agb phase for agb stars of decreasing mass and/or increasing metallicity ( see e.g. iben 1976 , fujimoto & sugimoto 1979 ) .",
    "this was a common problem ( see lattanzio 1989 for a review ) .",
    "recent works showed that with the new opal opacities , the 3dup can now be obtained even for low - mass pop i objects ( see e.g. frost & lattanzio 1996 or straniero et al .",

    "it is moreover reinforced by the fact that other lighter nuclides also capture part of the available neutrons ( mainly , by increasing order of atomic mass , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath174 , @xmath3 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath43 , @xmath9 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath34 ,  ) .",
    "one has to note that while the neutron abundance has to be increased to solve the @xmath284process problem , the present computations probably slightly overestimate the abundances of the above mentioned nuclides .    more specifically , in our thermal pulse models , the ratio of the engulfed mass of @xmath8 to the mass of @xmath260 inside the convective tongue at its maximum extent ranges between 0.002 to 0.03 .",
    "this upper limit is reached during the asymptotic regime of all our modeled stars and thus appears to be rather independent of the initial mass or metallicity . inside their first thermal pulses however , @xmath111 stars already produce neutrons ( ratio roughly equal to 0.02 ) while at the opposite , the corresponding thermal pulses of @xmath30 stars do not engulf substantial amounts of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we noted ( see sect .",
    "7.4 ) that the @xmath188 neutron source operates after the maximum of very intense thermal pulses , at a rate that is growing with the maximum temperature of the convective tongue , i.e. with initial mass and/or pulse number .    let us stress that such low quantities of @xmath8 ingested by thermal pulses are partly explained by the partial @xmath8 radiative burning , operating at the bottom of the inter - shell region during the inter - pulse phase ( see sect .",
    "consequently , it seems clear that the @xmath284process occuring inside tp - agb stars has two distinct origins ( in time and space ) :    * during the inter - pulse phase , _ radiative _ @xmath284process occurs in a radiative zone that is the lower part of the inter - shell region ; the only neutron source is @xmath8 ; * during and inside the convective tongue associated with thermal pulses , the _ classical _ @xmath284process takes place with two possible neutron sources : _ ( i ) _ the remainder amount of @xmath8 that is engulfed by the convective tongue and , to a lower extent ( maximum a few percents ) , _ ( ii ) _ the @xmath188 , close to the end of hot thermal pulses .",
    "let us emphasize that the @xmath359 and accompanying @xmath95 reactions have non - negligible energetic effects on the structural evolution of the convective tongues .",
    "we compute again some thermal pulses by treating together nucleosynthesis and time - dependent convective mixing through eqs .",
    "we observed an abundance gradient inside the convective tongue for a few nuclides that are involved in very fast nuclear reactions ( neutrons , protons and some unstable nuclides like @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) .",
    "globally however , the final abundances resulting from the thermal pulse nucleosynthesis were similar to within @xmath360 compared to standard computations .",
    "more specifically , neutrons were systematically found to be much more abundant ( by typically five orders of magnitude ) at the base of the convective tongues , meaning that the ingested @xmath8 is first transported down before it is destroyed by @xmath282 .",
    "the liberated neutrons are very rapidly captured , as attested e.g. by a greater proton abundance at the base of the convective tongue too .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that matter that is actually irradiated by the neutron flux is only the bottom part of each convective tongue .",
    "the number of free neutrons by seed @xmath260 is so enhanced .",
    "such an approach has already been suggested by malaney et al .",
    "the conclusion , however , remains that in order to reproduce the observed distribution of @xmath280 elements in the primitive solar system , higher neutron fluxes are still needed .",
    "the most natural way to conciliate observations and theoretical models concerning the production of the @xmath280 elements should be to increase the amount of @xmath8 in the inter - shell region .",
    "this can be done if protons are transported down , e.g. during the 3dup .",
    "@xmath8 could then be produced by the @xmath270 reaction .",
    "such a scenario would enhance the @xmath284process in both sites where it can occur . in our opinion , the present failure to build this extra - amount of @xmath8 could be related to our bad treatment of convective boundaries , especially when they rapidly penetrates very inhomogeneous regions , like it is the case during the 3dup events .",
    "the possible occurrence of such a slow - particle transport process able to transport protons down into the inter - shell region and its exact efficiency will be quantitatively investigated in the context of low - mass agb stars .",
    "these stars have indeed longer inter - pulse and 3dup durations that could allow to transport significant amounts of hydrogen downwards ( see sect . 9 ) .",
    "straniero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have recently shown that such enhanced amounts of @xmath8 in the inter - shell region could indeed allow the radiative @xmath284process to occur .",
    "most interestingly , they found that the resulting signatures are rather similar to those coming from classical @xmath284process computations and are even reached faster .",
    "this work is very important as it clearly demonstrates that this so - called `` @xmath8 pocket '' allows to explain the observed @xmath280 element synthesis in agb stars .      in order to summarize our detailed discussion of nucleosynthesis in the previous sections ,",
    "we now identify which specific nuclear region , inside a tp - agb star , mainly contributes to the surface abundance change of each nuclide , when the third dredge - up occurs .",
    "concerning the light elements , let us just recall ( see sect .",
    "7.2 ) that @xmath2 can be produced by hbb in the convective envelope of @xmath297 @xmath361 ( @xmath112 ) agb stars with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) .",
    "when a third dredge - up occurs , the convective envelope first penetrates the inter - shell region that is depleted in @xmath170 and then reaches a deeper region previously enriched in @xmath170 by the convective tongue . as a result , @xmath170 globally increases in the convective envelope .",
    "the situation is reversed for @xmath8 . after a 3dup",
    ", the envelope is somewhat impoverished in @xmath8 as this nuclide is almost completely destroyed inside the convective tongue .",
    "consequently , the isotopic ratio @xmath170/@xmath8 significantly increases at each 3dup , all the more as the convective envelope mass is reduced .",
    "however , in our @xmath294 @xmath113 ( @xmath112 ) tp - agb stars with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) , hbb is strong enough to partially convert @xmath170 in @xmath8 through the cn cycle so that the surface @xmath170/@xmath8 drastically decreases .",
    "for these objects , the 3dup and hbb have opposite effects .",
    "last but not least , @xmath38 , somewhat produced by thermal pulses and the third burning shell , is up - heaved to the surface during 3dup events , where it however substantially decays in the less massive agb stars .",
    "@xmath171 is produced in the inter - shell region but is strongly destroyed inside thermal pulses .",
    "@xmath172 is destroyed in the inter - shell region while it is somewhat produced by the first few thermal pulses and then destroyed inside full amplitude thermal pulses , i.e. those that can be followed by a 3dup . as a consequence ,",
    "the surface isotopic ratio @xmath171/@xmath172 is expected to slightly increase from 3dup to 3dup .",
    "again , as the cn cycle operates inside the convective envelope of the most massive agb stars , @xmath171 is produced from @xmath170 and @xmath172 is destroyed , thus leading to very high @xmath171/@xmath172 ratios .",
    "if hbb occurs at very high temperatures ( i.e. @xmath362 k ) a rather long time enough ( i.e. for the lowest mass loss rate ) , the approach towards the cno bi - cycle equilibrium leads to an increase of the @xmath172 abundance and consequently , a decreasing @xmath171/@xmath172 ratio .",
    "this mainly concerns our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) agb star with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) .",
    "@xmath173 , like @xmath170 , is depleted in the inter - shell region , but is produced inside the thermal pulses . during 3dup events ,",
    "its surface abundance very slightly increases .",
    "@xmath174 is always considerably depleted in both the inter - shell and thermal pulse regions , so that a 3dup decreases its surface abundance .",
    "finally , at the end of full amplitude thermal pulses , @xmath96 has a lower abundance as inside the convective envelope .",
    "as it is also completely destroyed in the inter - shell region , its abundance drastically decreases from 3dup to 3dup .",
    "consequently , both @xmath173/@xmath174 and @xmath173/@xmath96 surface isotopic ratios significantly increase during each dredge - up .",
    "if hbb is strong enough however , the operation of the on cycle increases the amount of @xmath174 to the expense of @xmath173 and substantially destroys @xmath96 .",
    "so , in massive agb stars , @xmath173/@xmath174 can decrease while @xmath173/@xmath96 further increases much more than in stars that do not experience hbb .",
    "@xmath3 is destroyed in the hbs but it is significantly produced by thermal pulses . as a consequence ,",
    "3dup events must lead to correlated @xmath3 and @xmath170 surface enhancements , since both elements are produced in the same region .",
    "as already explained , @xmath186 is almost unchanged in the hbs and thermal pulse nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xmath187 is destroyed inside the inter - shell region but produced inside thermal pulses , this production slightly increasing from pulse to pulse , whatever @xmath193 or @xmath6 .",
    "third dredges - up consequently slightly decreases the @xmath186/@xmath187 isotopic ratio . in our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 )",
    "agb models with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) however , @xmath187 is partially destroyed by hbb . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath186/@xmath188 ratio substantially decreases from 3dup to 3dup due to large @xmath188 production in the hbs and especially inside the thermal pulses .    during 3dup events ,",
    "the surface abundance of @xmath4 slightly increases for agb stars with initial masses up to @xmath112 ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) , due to its production in the hbs .",
    "the hotter hbs of more massive agb stars do not produce @xmath4 , globally .",
    "our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) models for the same respective @xmath6 even slightly destroy @xmath4 by hbb .",
    "@xmath189 is somewhat destroyed in the hbs of our most massive agb stars , especially those with @xmath1 , while its abundance does not change significantly after the thermal pulse nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xmath190 is depleted in the inter - shell region of our @xmath111 models with @xmath195 as well as in the @xmath1 models of all masses .",
    "it is however produced in the hbs of @xmath297 @xmath112 agb stars with @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , its surface abundance evolution following 3dup events is mainly conditioned by its large abundance ( compared to the envelope one ) in the region where thermal pulses occur , especially inside the most massive agb stars . therefore , the surface @xmath189/@xmath190 isotopic ratio necessarily decreases in all agb stars .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath189/@xmath191 ratio that roughly behaves in a similar way .",
    "reasons are also rather similar , even if @xmath191 is less modified than @xmath190 in the hbs . at the surface of our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) agb stars , the abundances of both @xmath190 and @xmath191",
    "can be enhanced to the expense of @xmath189 , if hbb is strong enough , leading to very low @xmath189/@xmath190 and @xmath189/@xmath191 ratios . as we will see in sect .",
    "8.1 however , this only concerns the end of the tp - agb phase in extreme situations allowing hbb to occur a long time enough ( e.g. in case of relatively low mass loss rates ) .",
    "only a very small amount of @xmath43 is present in the convective envelope of e - agb stars as a result of the first ( and eventually the second ) dredge(s)-up . along the tp - agb phase",
    ", @xmath43 is largely produced in the hbs and most of it accumulates in the inter - shell region . inside full amplitude thermal pulses however , it is somewhat destroyed . for its part",
    ", @xmath192 is slightly produced in the hbs , especially inside the most massive agb stars .",
    "consequently , @xmath43/@xmath192 significantly increases with time during the tp - agb phase , due to the repetitive 3dup episodes .",
    "of course , dilution by convective mixing being more important for increasing @xmath193 , the highest ratios are expected at the surface of the less massive agb stars .",
    "however , the same extreme cases mentioned in the case of the mg isotopic ratios can lead to very high @xmath43/@xmath192 ratios for the most massive agb stars .",
    "> from si , the 3dup does not change significantly the surface isotopic ratios . however , as stressed in sect .",
    "7.5 , when models will be able to reproduce the @xmath280 element enhancements at the surface of evolved agb stars , si and s isotopic ratios could be slightly modified by the high neutron flux .",
    "in this last section , we present our predictions concerning _ ( i ) _ the evolution of all the surface isotopic ratios along the tp - agb phase ( by including our evolutionary models and extrapolations up to the convective envelope removal ) and _ ( ii ) _ the total amount of material ejected at different ages for all the species up to @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to the previous sections for detailed explanations .",
    "thus , in the following , we will just comment these predictions",
    ".      figs .",
    "[ xsurf302a ] and [ xsurf302b ] display , for the @xmath111 agb star with @xmath7 , the evolution of the isotopic ratios as a function of the total remaining mass that decreases due to mass loss .",
    "similar figures for the other six agb stars are only displayed in the electronic version .",
    "let us stress that we stop our calculations at the last thermal pulse that occurs before the convective envelope mass is reduced below @xmath363 .",
    "this stage indeed roughly corresponds to the pn ejection that we do not maintain to model here .",
    "this explains the quite large remaining total stellar masses in the figures , especially for those computed with the highest mass loss rates .",
    "the first comment concerns the formation of carbon stars . @xmath111 agb stars with @xmath7 and 3 and @xmath112 agb stars with",
    "@xmath1 become carbon stars during their tp - agb phase .",
    "the surface @xmath170/@xmath173 becomes greater than unity more rapidly for _",
    "( i ) _ decreasing total mass and/or _ ( ii ) _ decreasing @xmath6 . this metallicity dependence is confirmed by the increase of c stars compared to m stars from the galactic bulge to lmc and smc ( blanco et al . 1978 ) .",
    "our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) agb stars with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) can also become c stars with our lowest mass loss rates .",
    "in such cases indeed , in spite of very efficient hbb transforming @xmath170 in @xmath8 and @xmath171 , many 3dup events can still occur with very reduced envelope masses , so that the relatively short inter - pulse phases are not long enough to substantially destroy @xmath170 .",
    "we will see however , together with other isotopic ratios , that these very low mass loss rates seem actually extreme .",
    "let us emphasize that the only super - lithium - rich star ( see sect .",
    "7.2 ) we found to be also a carbon star is the @xmath113 with @xmath321 one ( with our medium mass loss rate ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned in sect .",
    "6.2 , observations indicate that @xmath7 carbon stars are formed easier ( i.e. at lower luminosities ) than predicted by all the models .",
    "let us also stress the very high @xmath170/@xmath8 isotopic ratios that can be expected at the surface of @xmath272 @xmath112 agb stars , whatever @xmath6 . on the other hand , more massive agb stars experience hbb that progressively leads the @xmath170/@xmath8 isotopic ratio close to its cn cycle equilibrium value ( formation of j stars ) .",
    "the case of @xmath112 stars with @xmath1 very clearly shows the competition between the 3dup episodes ( increasing @xmath170/@xmath8 ) and hbb ( decreasing it ) . for lower mass loss rates ,",
    "the 3dup events are more numerous for the same total mass decrease , leading to a more rapid @xmath170/@xmath8 increase .",
    "however , the corresponding longer tp - agb phase allows the base of the convective envelope to reach higher temperatures that finally destroy @xmath170 through the cn cycle . this efficient transformation of @xmath170 to @xmath8 also reduces the @xmath170/@xmath173 ratio , i.e. the possibility to form carbon stars .",
    "it happens if the temperatures at the base of the convective envelopes become higher than @xmath364 k. such stars have corresponding surface luminosities @xmath297 @xmath365 ( @xmath366 ) for @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) , i.e. @xmath367 ( -6.45 ) .",
    "we consequently predict that c stars can not be formed at higher luminosities than this threshold , due to strong hbb .",
    "this is in agreement with boothroyd et al .",
    "( 1993 ) predictions .",
    "this also corresponds to the observed threshold for agb stars of the lmc ( cohen et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "finally , note the surface pollution in @xmath38 that is more important , compared to that of @xmath8 , for decreasing total masses . for @xmath111 agb stars , the surface @xmath8/@xmath38 ratio is quite independent of the mass loss rate .",
    "this is due to the inter - pulse duration that is significantly greater than the @xmath38 lifetime , so that the @xmath38 decay is the dominant factor for the @xmath8/@xmath38 ratio evolution at the surface of such stars .",
    "the quite complicated behavior of the @xmath8/@xmath38 isotopic ratio at the surface of our most massive models is again due to the competition between the 3dup that adds @xmath38 into the convective envelope and hbb that can partially destroy it . by extrapolation",
    ", it is reasonable to expect even lower @xmath8/@xmath38 ratios in low - mass agb stars .",
    "as mentioned in forestini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , @xmath38 could become detectable for @xmath273 @xmath111 evolved agb stars .",
    "due to hbb , those stars showing very low surface @xmath170/@xmath8 ratios are also expected to have very high @xmath171/@xmath172 ones .",
    "it has to be stressed indeed that in our most massive agb stars , the cn cycle operating inside the convective envelope produces large amounts of @xmath171 .",
    "the @xmath173/@xmath174 and @xmath173/@xmath96 surface isotopic ratios also evolve as expected from our discussions in sect .",
    "note that quite low @xmath173/@xmath174 and very high @xmath173/@xmath96 ratios , which are clear signatures of the operation of the on cycle at the base of the convective envelope ( hbb ) , appear rather simultaneously with the cn cycle signatures in our most massive objects . also remark the progressive @xmath173/@xmath96 decrease in our @xmath30 ( @xmath113 ) agb star with @xmath7 ( 0.005 ) .",
    "for these objects , the temperature at the base of the convective envelope finally becomes high enough for @xmath173 to partially burn .",
    "the @xmath3 surface enhancements we predict are displayed in a special form , corresponding to the observation presentations adopted by jorissen et al .",
    "compared to their fig .",
    "8 , two conclusions can be stated .",
    "* there is a clear observed correlation between the @xmath3 excess and the degree of @xmath170 surface pollution , that is perfectly understandable from the identified nucleosynthetic processes and the mixing episodes ( see sect .",
    "furthermore , our models clearly indicate a trend : the less massive the agb star , the more efficient the @xmath3 surface enhancement .",
    "in fact , our most massive models even show a surface @xmath3 depletion due to its partial destruction by hbb . *",
    "our @xmath7 models well reproduce only the less @xmath3 enriched stars in the [ @xmath3/@xmath173 ] versus @xmath170/@xmath173 diagram .",
    "based on the trend just mentioned , we predict that the agb stars showing very large @xmath3 surface enhancements have initial total masses @xmath273 @xmath111 . we plan to verify this statement , i.e. that low - mass agb stars are the most efficient @xmath3 galactic producers ( see sect .",
    "9 ) .    as expected , the @xmath189/@xmath190 and @xmath189/@xmath191 surface isotopic ratios are much less sensitive to the 3dup episodes and hbb .",
    "more precisely , only our most massive models with the lowest mass loss rates show large @xmath189 depletions due to a very strong hbb .",
    "again , these are however quite extreme situations .",
    "last but not least , we predict substantial @xmath43 surface enhancements due to the repetitive dredges - up of the hbs and inter - shell regions . the @xmath43/@xmath192 isotopic ratio tends to decrease with increasing total mass due to _ ( i ) _ the greater dilution as mixing occurs in a more massive convective envelope and _ ( ii ) _ the thinner hbs and inter - shell regions ( in mass )",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath43/@xmath192 could well be increasing again if @xmath43 was produced inside the convective envelope itself by strong hbb .",
    "note however that such a very high @xmath43 production level is actually expected to be accompanied by very low mg isotopic ratios , as @xmath43 is produced by the mgal chain in the extreme situations mentioned above .",
    "let us finally mention that wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) presented computations in which the evolution of the @xmath43 surface abundance has been followed self - consistently , by including the effect of neutron irradiation due to an enhanced amount of @xmath8 in the inter - shell region ( to engender a @xmath284process ) .",
    "our results compare very well with those obtained by boothroyd et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) concerning the o isotopic ratios in intermediate - mass stars .",
    "they also mention the problem to reproduce the @xmath173/@xmath174 ratio , especially in low - mass carbon agb stars .",
    "we can not go further in this comparison without having yet computed the tp - agb phase of low - mass stars .",
    "boothroyd et al .",
    "( 1995 ) already suggested that to conciliate all the data with observations of low - mass stars , one probably has to take into account of slow - particle transports inside radiative zones , what they called `` cool - bottom precessing '' .",
    "that is what we plan to do ( see sect .",
    "evolutionary models of tp - agb stars can be strongly constrained by the confrontation between predicted and observed surface isotopic ratios , especially if different ratios are observed for the same stars .",
    "for most of the observed agb stars , only the c and o isotopic ratios have been determined ( see e.g. harris & lambert 1984 ; harris et al . 1985 ; lambert et al .",
    "1986 ; harris et al .",
    "1987 ; harris & lambert 1987 ; kahane et al .",
    "globally , we found agreements .",
    "general features come out .    * as the temperatures required at the base of the convective envelope to allow @xmath2 production ( see sect .",
    "7.2 ) are significantly lower than those allowing efficient @xmath170 destruction by the cn cycle , we predict that luminous c stars enriched in @xmath2 can exist , especially for lower @xmath6 objects ( that have lower @xmath173 content ) .",
    "there are indeed a few % of the observed c stars that are also super - lithium - rich and there are more numerous in the lmc compared to our galaxy ( see e.g. smith & lambert 1990b for the lmc and feast 1974 for the galaxy ) .",
    "* there is no observed c star with @xmath170/@xmath8 @xmath369 .",
    "most of the j stars show @xmath170/@xmath8 ratios between 3 et 4 , i.e. very close to the cn cycle equilibrium value .",

    "most of the other agb stars present @xmath173/@xmath174 ratios ranged between 300 and 4000 and @xmath173/@xmath96 ratios ranged between 500 and 5000 . only stars with rather high @xmath173/@xmath174 ratios are difficult to explain with our intermediate - mass agb models ( see also boothroyd et al .",
    "also note that the corresponding o isotopic ratios in the ism are @xmath173/@xmath174 @xmath370 and @xmath173/@xmath96 @xmath371 .",
    "again , there is a problem with @xmath174 .",
    "let us however stress that important uncertainties remain concerning the nuclear cross sections of proton captures on @xmath174 .",
    "on the other hand , low - mass agb stars are present among those observations .",
    "presently , there is only one star for which all the isotopic ratios have been determined .",
    "it is cw leo .",
    "this c star is one of the nearest evolved agb star ever observed .",

    "1987 ; keady et al . 1988 ; griffin 1990 ) .",

    "consequently , its present convective envelope mass is probably very reduced ( @xmath378 @xmath379 typically ) .",
    "the circumstellar envelope of cw leo allowed very accurate determinations of the isotopic ratios ( see kahane et al .",

    "( 1995 ) and forestini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , almost all these isotopic ratios seem to be consistent ( within the error bars ) , following our predictions , with an agb star that had a main sequence total mass between 4 and @xmath113 .",
    "however , @xmath173/@xmath174 is again not well explained . as various surface isotopic ratios ( especially @xmath171/@xmath172 and @xmath173/@xmath96 )",

    "1991a ) are consistent with those coming from the surface of evolved tp - agb stars of intermediate - mass .",
    "this is of course in favor of the presence , when the solar system has been formed , of one or a few agb stars in its surroundings .",
    "such grains are indeed well known to be formed in the cool atmosphere of evolved agb stars ( i.e. when mass loss rates become rather high ) .",

    "the derived ratios , @xmath173/@xmath174 @xmath390 , @xmath173/@xmath96 @xmath391 and @xmath43/@xmath192 @xmath392 , are in perfect agreement with ratios corresponding to a @xmath393 @xmath112 agb star of nearly solar metallicity . finally , other sic @xmath43-rich grains raise problems , like that discovered by zinner et al .",

    "we also compare our predictions with various observations ( at different evolutionary stages ) in order to clearly identify the processes that should be included in future models .      * concerning the structure ( intensities , temperatures ) of the thermal pulses as well as the thermal properties at the base of the convective envelope , the most decisive quantities are the total mass and core mass . both change with time in a way that is governed by the increasing mass loss rate .",
    "this translates into a great sensitivity of the various nucleosynthesis processes to the adopted mass loss rate .",
    "consequently , the evolution of the thermal pulse characteristics crucially depend on this last quantity , unfortunately still rather badly known . in addition , the lower the mass loss rates , the longer the tp - agb phase , the more third dredge - up events have time to occur and the greater are the surface abundance changes due to hbb .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the high sensitiveness of the predicted surface evolution of almost all the isotopic ratios to the mass loss rate dependence on time .",
    "* on the other hand , at a given total stellar mass , core masses are greater for lower metallicities , as a result of the central burning phases . as a consequence , for the reason mentioned at the former point , tp - agb stars with @xmath1 mostly behave like @xmath7 ones with a total mass greater by @xmath415 @xmath416 .",
    "however , due to important differences in initial compositions that also influence the nuclear reactions , this is not completely true as far as isotopic ratios are concerned . at the end of the tp - agb phase indeed , some yields are quite different for both @xmath6 we have studied . *",
    "the neutron captures on intermediate - mass and heavy nuclides occur in two distinct sites inside tp - agb stars , namely _",
    "( i ) _ at the base of the inter - shell zone during the inter - pulse phase and , as already known , _",
    "( ii ) _ inside the convective tongues associated with thermal pulses . along the asymptotic tp - agb ,",
    "the amount of produced neutrons is rather independent of the initial total mass and metallicity ( at least for intermediate - mass objects ) . * concerning chemical evolution of galaxies , intermediate - mass stars , at the end of their existence ,",
    "appear to be rather significant producers of @xmath162 , @xmath48 , @xmath2 ( most massive and/or higher @xmath6 stars ) , @xmath8 , @xmath171 , @xmath174 , @xmath3 , @xmath188 , @xmath4 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "a found trend , compared to observations , however clearly supports the idea that most of the @xmath3 present in the interstellar medium has to come from low - mass agb stars ( that point has to be confirmed by forthcoming evolutionary models ) . + intermediate - mass agb stars also substantially produce radio - nuclides , namely @xmath38 and @xmath259 .",
    "the former one mostly comes from lower mass stars while it is the contrary for the last one .",
    "+ these stars partially deplete the interstellar medium content in @xmath2 ( less massive stars ) , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath96 , @xmath186 , @xmath189 and @xmath9 .",
    "* we have not yet identified the @xmath8 additional source needed to quantitatively explain the @xmath284process .",
    "this process is however required in order to account for many observations unquestionably indicating that agb stars are responsible for the main component of the solar system heavy element distribution .",
    "some suggestions have been made .",
    "radiative diffusion operating during the tp - agb phase of low - mass stars could substantially help .",
    "although already invoked , such a process has never been yet included in agb star evolution models . *",
    "the rather high level of @xmath2 production detected at the surface of some evolved but relatively faint agb stars of our galaxy still remains unaccountable .",
    "thus , the cameron - fowler mechanism does not explain all the super - lithium - rich agb stars .",
    "as these galactic objects have relatively low initial masses , the explanation could also come from the radiative slow - transport processes above mentioned . *",
    "last but not least , some c stars are observed , especially in the galactic bulge , with low luminosities at which the models fail at predicting the occurrence of the third dredge - up . this is probably due to our bad knowledge ( and treatment ) of finely tuned convection motions in boundaries of stellar regions having strong chemical composition gradients . clearly , some kind of extra - mixing ( deeper inside nuclearly processed regions ) has to be invoked .",
    "however , no self - consistent mechanism has been settled and tested through complete evolution models up to now .",
    "other confrontations with observations require the modeling of low - mass agb stars . a clear distinction between low- and intermediate - mass stars is justified . indeed ,",
    "numerous observations indicate that `` non - standard '' particle transport processes are acting inside low - mass stars at different phases of their evolution , that substantially modify the chemical structure compared to what is obtained in classical models . during the various dredge - up episodes , matter up - heaved to the surface has consequently a different composition .",
    "this is not the case in intermediate - mass stars . in conclusion",
    ", low - mass agb stellar models , maintaining to make detailed predictions concerning the evolution of surface isotopic ratios , have to include such slow - particle transport processes .",
    "they are currently being calculated and will be presented in a next - coming paper .",
    "we are first indebted to maurizio busso , the referee , for its very careful reading of our manuscript that helped us to significantly improve and clarify it .",
    "we also thank him and roberto gallino for the very instructive discussions we already had together about these very complex agb stars .",
    "let us finally thank lionel siess for his always valuable contributions to improve the stellar evolution code and related utilities .",
