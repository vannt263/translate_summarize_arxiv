    "in the standard model of particle physics , neutrinos are strictly massless .",
    "any evidence for neutrino masses would , therefore , imply physics beyond the standard model .",
    "even though the direct experimental determination of a neutrino mass is ( probably ) far beyond the current experimental reach , experiments have been able to obtain indirect , and recently very strong , evidence for neutrino masses , via neutrino oscillations .",
    "the key evidence for neutrino oscillations comes from the angular dependent flux of atmospheric muon - type neutrinos measured at superkamiokande @xcite , combined with a large deviation of the muon - type to electron - type neutrino flux ratio from theoretical predictions .",
    "this `` atmospheric neutrino puzzle '' is best solved by assuming that @xmath5 oscillates into @xmath6 and that the @xmath7 does not oscillate .",
    "for a recent analysis of all the atmospheric neutrino data see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , measurements of the solar neutrino flux @xcite have always been plagued by a large suppression of the measured solar @xmath7 flux with respect to theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "again , this `` solar neutrino puzzle '' is best resolved by assuming that @xmath7 oscillates into a linear combination of the other flavour eigenstates @xcite ( for a more conservative analysis of the event rates and the inclusion of the `` dark side '' of the parameter space , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent analysis of the solar neutrino data which includes the mixing of three active neutrino species can be found in @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillations were first hypothesised by bruno pontecorvo in the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of three flavour mixing was first raised by maki , nakagawa and sakata @xcite . in light of the solar neutrino puzzle",
    ", wolfenstein @xcite and mikheyev and smirnov @xcite realized that neutrino ",
    "matter interactions could affect in very radical ways the survival probability of electron - type neutrinos which are produced in the solar core and detected at the earth ( msw effect ) .    since then , significant effort has been devoted to understanding the oscillation probabilities of electron - type neutrinos produced in the sun . for example , in @xcite the survival probability of solar electron - type neutrinos was discussed in the context of three - neutrino mixing including matter effects , and solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle in this context were studied ( for example , in @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the understanding of solar neutrino oscillations is extend to the case of other active neutrino species ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and antineutrinos ) produced in the solar core . even though only electron - type neutrinos are produced by the nuclear reactions which take place in the sun s innards ,",
    "it is well know that , in a number of dark matter models , dark matter particles can be trapped gravitationally inside the sun , and that the annihilation of these should yield a flux of high energy neutrinos ( @xmath8  gev ) of all species which may be detectable at the earth @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is one of the goals of very large `` neutrino telescopes , '' such as amanda @xcite or baikal @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand how neutrino oscillations will affect the expected event rates at these experiments .",
    "the oscillation probability of all neutrino species has , of course , been studied in different contexts , such as in the case of neutrinos produced in the core of supernovae @xcite or in the case of neutrinos propagating in constant electron number densities @xcite .",
    "the latter case has been receiving a considerable amount of attention from neutrino factory studies @xcite .",
    "the case at hand ( gev solar neutrinos ) differs significantly from these mentioned above , in at least a few of the following : source - detector distance , electron number density average value and position dependency , energy average value and spectrum .",
    "neutrino factory studies , for example , are interested in @xmath0(1000 )  km base - lines , @xmath0(10 )  gev electron - type and muon - type neutrinos produced via muon decay propagating in roughly constant , earth - like ( matter densities around 3 g/@xmath9 ) electron number densities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .  2 ,",
    "the well known case of two - flavour oscillations is reviewed in some detail , while special attention will be paid to neutrinos produced inside the sun . in sec .",
    "3 the same discussion is extended to the less familiar case of three - flavour oscillations .",
    "again , special attention is paid to neutrinos produced in the sun s core . in sec .",

    "will be analysed numerically , and the three - neutrino multi - dimensional parameter space will be explored .",
    "contains a summary of the results and the conclusions .",
    "it is important to comment at this point that one of the big challenges of studying three - flavour oscillations is the multi - dimensional parameter space , composed of three mixing angles , two mass - squared differences , and one complex phase , plus the neutrino energy .",
    "for this reason , the discussions presented here will take advantage of the current experimental situation to constrain the parameter space , and of the possibility of producing neutrinos of all species via dark matter annihilations to constrain the neutrino energies to the range from a few to tens of gev .",
    "in this section , the well studied case of two - flavour oscillations will be reviewed @xcite .",
    "this is done in order to present the formalism which will be later extended to the case of three - flavour oscillations and describe general properties of neutrino oscillations and of neutrinos produced in the sun s core .",
    "neutrino oscillations take place because , similar to what happens in the quark sector , neutrino weak eigenstates are different from neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the two sets are related by a unitary matrix , which is , in the case of two - flavour mixing , parametrised by one mixing angle @xmath10 .",

    "also , the constant @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) contours are shifted to larger ( smaller ) values of @xmath126 .",
    "the other prominent ( and expected , as mentioned above ) feature is the distortion of the contours at large values of @xmath120 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one observed in fig .",
    "[ dm21_std ] .",
    "i conclude this subsection with a comment on antineutrinos . as discussed previously , @xmath401 , such that the `` normal '' hierarchies yield `` inverted '' hierarchy results for antineutrinos , and vice - verse .",
    "one can not , however , apply fig .",
    "[ dm21_std ] and fig .",
    "[ sso_min ] for the antineutrinos because both @xmath402 have to change sign , not just @xmath121 .",
    "qualitatively , however , it is possible to understand the constant @xmath229 contours by examining figures fig .",
    "[ dm21_std ] and fig .",
    "[ sso_min ] reflected in a mirror positioned at @xmath403 , meaning that @xmath404 .",
    "the equality is not complete because one is also required to exchange @xmath405 , as mentioned earlier .      as the average neutrino energy increases , the values of @xmath31 start to resemble more the pure vacuum case .",
    "this is easy to see from figs .",
    "[ p3h ] and [ 1-pcl ] .",
    "any deviation of @xmath282 from @xmath126 goes away even at lma for @xmath406  gev , while `` h - m '' effects remain important up to @xmath407  tev , even though quantitatively the effect decreases noticeably .",
    "this can be illustrated by the value of @xmath273 at atm , for example , which drops from 0.87 for energies which range from 1 to 5  gev ( see the previous subsections ) to 0.058 , for energies which range from 100 to 110  gev .",
    "furthermore , all @xmath408 increase as the energy increases , for fixed values of @xmath402 .",
    "therefore , low becomes indistinguishable from vac at @xmath409  gev .",
    "for @xmath0(tev ) neutrinos the sensitivity to @xmath120 remains only for its highest allowed values , while one should start worrying about nontrivial oscillatory effects due to @xmath410 .",
    "the case of higher energy neutrinos contains a more serious complications : neutrino absorption inside the sun . as the neutrino energy increases",
    ", one has to start worrying about the fact that absorptive neutrino interactions can take place .",
    "according to @xcite , for neutrinos produced in the sun s core , absorption becomes important for @xmath411  gev . in this case ,",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath412 interact with nuclear matter and produce electrons and muons , respectively .",
    "the former are capture and `` lost '' inside the sun , while the latter stop before decaying into low energy neutrinos .",
    "the case of @xmath6-sun interactions is more interesting , because the @xmath413-leptons produced via charged current interactions decay before `` stopping '' , yielding @xmath6 s with slightly reduced energies .",
    "therefore , it is possible to get a flux of very high energy initial state @xmath413-neutrinos but not muon or electron - type neutrinos .",
    "such effects have been studied for high energy galactic neutrinos traversing the earth @xcite .",
    "the effect of neutrino oscillations inside the sun in the presence of nonnegligible neutrino absorption is certainly of great interest but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the oscillation probability of @xmath0(gev ) neutrinos of all flavours produced in the sun s core has been computed , including matter effects , which are , in general , nontrivial .",
    "in particular , it was shown that , unlike the two - flavour oscillation case , in the three - flavour case the probability of a neutrino produced in the flavour eigenstate @xmath20 to be detected as a flavour eigenstate @xmath21 ( @xmath31 ) is ( in general ) different from @xmath414 , even if the @xmath2-violating phase of the mns matrix vanishes .",
    "this is , of course , expected since sun  neutrino interactions explicitly break @xmath28-invariance .",
    "indeed , it is the case of two - flavour oscillations which is special , in the sense that the number of independent oscillation probabilities is too small because of unitarity .",
    "the results of a particular scan of the parameter space are presented in sec .",
    "4 . in this case",
    ", special attention was paid to the regions of the parameter space which are preferred by the current experimental situation .",
    "it turns out that , in the case of a `` normal '' neutrino mass hierarchy , it is possible to suppress @xmath40 tremendously with respect to its pure vacuum oscillation values , by a mechanism that is similar to the well known msw effect in the case of two - flavour oscillations : the parameters are such that electron - type neutrinos produced in the sun s core exit the sun ( almost ) as pure mass eigenstates , and the @xmath7 component of this eigenstate is small . both @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be significantly suppressed , and the constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 contours as a function of the `` solar '' angle and the smaller mass - squared differences are nontrivial .",
    "one important feature is that when @xmath3 is significantly suppressed , @xmath4 is not , and vice - versa .",
    "one consequence of this is that , for some regions of the parameter space , it is possible to have an enhancement of @xmath6 s detected in the earth with respect to the number of @xmath5 s ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "this may have important implications for solar wimp annihilation searches at neutrino telescopes , and will be studied in another oportunity .",
    "it is important to note that the effect of neutrino oscillations on the expected event rate at neutrino telescopes will depend on the expected production rate of individual neutrino species inside the sun , which is , of course , model dependent .    in the case of an `` inverted '' mass hierarchy ,",
    "the situation is very similar to the pure vacuum case , and no particular suppression of any @xmath253 is possible .",
    "indeed , for a large region of the parameter space @xmath40 is in fact enhanced , a feature which is also observed in the two - flavour case @xcite .",
    "the case of higher energy neutrinos was very briefly discussed , and the crucial point is to note that , for neutrino energies above a few hundred gev , the absorption of neutrinos by the sun becomes important .",
    "the study of absorption effects is beyond the scope of this paper .    finally , it is important to reemphasise that the values of @xmath31 computed here are to be understood as if they were evaluated at the earth s surface .",
    "no earth - matter effects have been included .",
    "it is possible that earth - matter effects are important , especially the ones related to @xmath121 , in the advent that @xmath415 turns out to be `` large . ''",
