    "within the framework of classical electrodynamics , light can not interact with each other .",
    "however , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) predicts that vacuum polarization , a nonlinear effect of quantum fluctuations , intermediates photon - photon elastic scattering . a theoretical cross section was first calculated in 1933 using the dirac theory @xcite , and was later done using qed @xcite . the leading contribution to the photon - photon scattering cross section",
    "is described by a forth - order feynman diagram with an electron - positron loop ( a box diagram ) , whose scattering amplitude in the low energy region is strongly suppressed by four vertices and the electron loop .    when the photon energy in the center of mass system ( @xmath3 ) is less than @xmath4 , the first - order qed cross section for photons with the same linear polarization state can be described as @xmath5)^6\\ \\mathrm{m^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the fine structure constant and @xmath7 is the scattering angle in the center of mass system @xcite .",
    "the cross section is proportional to the sixth power of @xmath3 .",
    "the photon - photon scattering cross section can be enhanced since new particles predicted by physics beyond the standard model may mediate photon - photon scattering .",
    "for example , the axion , a pseudoscalar boson , can mediates photon - photon scattering by _ s _ or _",
    "t_-channel virtual axion exchange@xcite .",
    "previous searches have been performed using high intensity optical or infrared lasers to enhance the luminosity of scattering experiments @xcite . however , their sensitivity to photon - photon scattering is suppressed by the tiny qed cross section in the low energy region , @xmath8 at 1 ev , and by white background photons generated in their optical systems . by using x rays , the photon - photon cross section can be enhanced by around 23 orders of magnitude compared to the optical region .",
    "furthermore , signal x rays can be distinguished from background photons by using the energy information .    in 2013",
    "we performed the first photon - photon scattering experiment in the x - ray region at the spring-8 angstrom compact free - electron laser ( sacla ) @xcite .",
    "no signal was observed , and we obtained an upper limit on the cross section of photon - photon scattering of @xmath9 ( 95% c.l . ) at @xmath10 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the result of a recently upgraded experiment at sacla with an optimized setup . in this experiment",
    ", we replaced the x - ray beam collider with one with thinner blades .",
    "this yields a higher diffraction efficiency and smaller sizes of the colliding beams .",
    "the beam quality from sacla has also been improved , with respect to the repetition rate , bandwidth and pulse intensity .",
    "sacla generated horizontally - polarized x - ray pulses with @xmath11 photons per pulse , a repetition rate of 30 hz , a bandwidth of about 50 ev ( fwhm ) , a beam width of 200 @xmath12 ( fwhm ) , and a pulse duration less than 10 fs ( fwhm ) @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the energy of the initial x ray was set to 10.985 kev . for extracting x rays with energy within the acceptable bandwidth of our beam collider ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "x - ray beams were monochromatized to @xmath14 by two silicon ( 440 ) channel - cut monochromators .",
    "the pulse intensity was reduced by a monochromatic factor of @xmath15 , and the photon number of the monochromatic beams was around @xmath16 photons per pulse .",
    "the pulse duration of the monochromatic beams was expanded to @xmath17 fs due to the time - energy uncertainty relation .",
    "the monochromatic beams were focused to @xmath18 ( fwhm ) in the horizontal direction by an elliptical mirror @xcite . a detailed explanation of the beamline optics is given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the collision system using an x - ray beam collider is shown in fig .",
    "[ bm_schematics ] .",
    "the x - ray beam collider , composed of three thin blades manufactured on a silicon single crystal , diffracts x - ray beams in the transmission ( laue ) geometry with the ( 440 ) plane at the bragg angle of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray beam collider divides the incident beam into four beams ( rr , rt , tr , tt beams shown in fig .",
    "[ bm_schematics ] ) , two of which ( rr / tr ) collide obliquely with a crossing angle of @xmath20 and @xmath3 of @xmath21 .",
    "the thickness of the blades is 0.2 mm , and measured diffraction efficiencies of the colliding beams are 1.55% ( rr ) and 2.48% ( tr ) .",
    "the beam collider was installed in a vacuum chamber evacuated at a pressure of less than @xmath22 pa in order to reduce stray photons scattered by the residual gas .",
    "since the center of mass system of the two colliding photons is strongly boosted with @xmath23=1.7 , the spatial distribution of signal x rays is concentrated along the boost axis , and the scattered x rays on the boost axis have higher energy than the incident x ray .",
    "a germanium semiconductor detector ( canberra be2825 ) was used to measure the energy of the scattered x rays @xcite .",
    "the energy and time resolution of the detector were measured to be @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , for 26.3-kev x rays ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath25 ) , respectively .",
    "the detector was located on the boost axis of the experimental system as shown in fig .",
    "[ bm_schematics ] , and detected scattered x rays within a cone with an apex angle of @xmath27 around the boost axis .",
    "within this cone , the signal x rays have an energy between 18.1 and 19.9 kev , and the signal coverage is 17% .",
    "the detector was operated with external triggers synchronized to sacla . to reject environmental background ,",
    "a time window was set to @xmath28 , which corresponds to @xmath29 of the detector timing resolution .",
    "the energy was required to be between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , widened from the original signal energy range by the detector energy resolution ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the detection efficiency of the detector is @xmath33)% , as estimated by geant4 simulation , and cross - checked by using ri sources of @xmath34fe , @xmath35co , @xmath36ge , and @xmath37am @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on the absolute detection efficiency was taken as a systematic error .",
    "the per - pulse luminosity of the colliding beams at the collision point ( @xmath38 ) is given by the following formula @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the photon number of colliding beams , @xmath41 are the beam widths ( 1@xmath42 ) in the horizontal , vertical , and time directions , respectively , and @xmath43 is the crossing angle .",
    "the reduction factor @xmath44 , which comes from the oblique collision , is approximated to be 1 since @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is much smaller than @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "when the vertical or horizontal widths of the rr and tr beams ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) are different , effective values of @xmath51 are estimated as @xmath52 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical widths of the colliding beams were measured by knife edge scans using a gold wire ( @xmath53 ) and a steel rod , respectively .",
    "we assume that the colliding beams have a gaussian profile , and the widths were measured by scanning the edge and measuring the transmitted intensity using silicon pin photodiodes ( pd , hamamatsu s3590 - 09 ) .",
    "the transmitted intensity is well - fitted by an error function within the fluctuation of the beam intensity , and the horizontal and vertical widths ( @xmath25 ) were measured to be @xmath54/@xmath55 and @xmath56/ + @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "these uncertainties on beam sizes , which are considered as a source of systematic error , originate from fluctuations of sacla intensity during the knife edge scans . from these measured widths ,",
    "the effective beam widths @xmath51 are calculated to be @xmath58/@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the vertical widths of the colliding beams were widened by laue - case x - ray diffraction , and are proportional to the thickness of the blades @xcite .",
    "the vertical widths expected from the theoretical calculation of the shape of diffracted beams are @xmath60 @xmath12 ( rr)/@xmath61 @xmath62 ( tr ) , consistent with the measurements .",
    "the experiment was performed during a 60-hour beamtime at sacla in nov .",
    "2015 , and a total of @xmath63 x - ray pulses were used for the analysis . @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 were continuously monitored by pds , and their mean product , calculated from the pulse - by - pulse product of @xmath66 , was @xmath67 .",
    "the uncertainty on the detection efficiency of pds calculated by a geant4 simulation was taken as a systematic error .",
    "there are two main background sources .",
    "the dominant background source is an accidental coincidence of environmental x rays .",
    "this background was measured in an off - timing window , and the accidental contribution was estimated to be 0.4 events in the energy range 17.6 - 20.4 kev .    the measured distribution of x rays in time and energy is shown in fig.[2d_spec ] .",
    "events out of the time window are due to accidental coincidence of environmental x rays .",
    "events within the time window and with energy less than 11 kev are stray photons from the x - ray beams , generated by compton or rayleigh scattering ( @xmath68 kev ) or x - ray fluorescence from chamber materials such as stainless steel ( @xmath69 kev ) .",
    "when two stray x rays coincide in the germanium detector , it may enter the signal region .",
    "this pileup is the second source of background .",
    "the measured event rate of stray x rays is @xmath70 , and the expected pileup rate of two photons is estimated to be 0.01 events for @xmath71 pulses .",
    "no events were observed within the signal region , in which 0.4 background events were expected . by summing @xmath38 for all @xmath71 pulses ,",
    "the integrated luminosity @xmath72 is calculated to be @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainty on the luminosity is estimated by the root of the quadrature sum of relative errors on @xmath66 and @xmath51 , assuming that these systematic errors obey gaussian distributions , and that they are independent .",
    "the measured cross section of photon - photon scattering @xmath73 is estimated by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the expected number of signal events . from this formula ,",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath73 is calculated by combining the pdfs of @xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath72 . since no signal",
    "was observed in this experiment , the pdf of @xmath75 is an exponential distribution with a mean value of 1 .",
    "we postulate that @xmath76 and @xmath72 are normally distributed and independent of each other .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to the limit calculation are summarized in table [ tab : sys ] .    from the cumulative distribution function of @xmath73 , the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit is calculated to be @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "this result is 900 times more stringent than our previous limit .",
    "a breakdown of the enhancement factors is shown in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "the main enhancement factors are the gains in the product of the intensities of the colliding beams @xmath79 and the number of the measured pulses .",
    "@xmath79 is enhanced by two orders of magnitude , which originates from the reduction of the bandwidth of sacla ( from 80 ev to 50 ev ) , the increase in the intensity of sacla ( @xmath80 times higher ) , and the better diffraction efficiencies . in our previous experiment",
    ", we used an x - ray beam collider with blades 0.6 mm thick .",
    "meanwhile , the x - ray beam collider used in this experiment has thinner blades with the thickness of 0.2 mm , which results in 11 times higher diffraction efficiencies .",
    "the number of measured x - ray pulses was enhanced by a factor of 5.7 , due to the increase in the repetition rate of sacla ( from 20 hz to 30 hz ) and daq time ( from 9 hours to 32 hours ) .",
    "we have searched for photon - photon scattering at sacla with an optimized experimental setup . no signal was observed in the expected signal region , and the obtained 95% c.l .",
    "limit on the photon - photon scattering cross section was @xmath81 at @xmath10 .",
    "this limit is @xmath82 times more stringent than the result of our previous experiment .",
    "the sensitivity of our experiment is limited by the monochromatic factor ( @xmath83 ) and diffraction efficiencies ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "these small factors reduce the sensitivity , proportional to their square , by 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "it is technically difficult to enhance the efficiency of the current collision system , because the efficiency of the laue - case diffraction is close to the limitation due to the crystal - cutting process .",
    "there are two possibilities to further enhance the sensitivity .",
    "first , a new method , self - seeding , can improve the monochromatic factor .",
    "the bandwidth of sacla is currently limited to 50 ev because self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) @xcite , the amplification mechanism of xfel , originates from the stochastic density fluctuation of the electron beams .",
    "self - seeding will be introduced to sacla in the near future , and will improve the bandwidth to @xmath851 ev @xcite .",
    "this improved monochromaticity will reduce the monochromatic loss and enhance the luminosity by around three orders of magnitude .",
    "secondly , a new collision system using a bragg - case x - ray beam collider can enhance the diffraction efficiencies . for higher efficiency than the laue - case beam collider used in this experiment ,",
    "an x - ray beam collider using bragg - case diffraction will enable @xmath86 efficiencies of colliding beams @xcite .",
    "in addition , bragg diffraction does not expand the vertical widths of beams . by introducing a beam collider using bragg - case diffraction ,",
    "the luminosity can be enhanced by around three orders of magnitude .    with these improvements ,",
    "the luminosity of our experiment in the x - ray region can be significantly enhanced by six orders of magnitude . in order to measure signal x rays in such a high - luminosity experiment , a new detection system which excludes the pileup of stray x rays",
    "is needed .",
    "a double - sided silicon strip detector ( dssd ) is one candidate which can identify piled up x rays by using the position information provided by such a detector @xcite .",
    "the xfel experiment was performed at bl3 in sacla with the approval of jasri and the program review committee ( proposal no .",
    "2014b8028 and 2015b8007 ) . before the experiment ,",
    "preliminary experiments were performed at spring-8 bl19lxu beamline with the proposal number 20140024/20150010 .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the help given by the engineering team of sacla in the beamtime .",
