    "the importance of quantum teleportation @xcite is widely recognized today . not only does it enable the remote transmission of the state describing a quantum system to another one , without ever knowing the state , but it also allows the construction of a new way to perform quantum computation @xcite . in the previous and in many other applications of teleportation ,",
    "it is desirable , if not crucial , that the teleported state arrives at its destination ( bob ) exactly as it left the preparation station ( alice ) . in other words ,",
    "we want a unity fidelity output state , which is always achieved if alice and bob share a maximally entangled state ( mes ) @xcite .",
    "however , there might happen that our parties do not share a mes or , in addition , intermediate teleportations to other parties must be done before the state reaches bob .",
    "this limitation can be overcome by distilling out of an ensemble of partially entangled states ( pes s ) maximally entangled ones @xcite .",
    "but this approach requires a large amount of copies of pes s to succeed and is ineffective when just a few copies are available .",
    "another way to achieve unity fidelity teleportation with limited resources is based on the probabilistic quantum teleportation ( pqt ) protocols of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , in an interesting work , modawska and grudka @xcite presented yet another way of achieving probabilistically unity fidelity teleportation .",
    "their strategy was developed in the framework of the klm scheme @xcite for linear optical teleportation .",
    "the main idea behind their approach was the recognition that multiple ( successive ) teleportations using the _ same _ pes increased the chances of getting a perfect teleported qubit .",
    "we can also see the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite , as generalized here , as a way to extend the usefulness of quantum relays @xcite whenever non mes s are at stake and entanglement concentration is not practical ( only a few copies of entangled states are available ) .    in this contribution",

    "_ proposal @xcite , which allows us to express @xmath0 , the total probability of getting unity fidelity outcomes , as a function of the number of teleportations and of the shared entanglement between alice and bob .",
    "we then present two new protocols ( protocols @xmath2 and @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , both of which are more efficient than the previous one . an important feature of these protocols is that they give @xmath4 for a huge class of pes s .",
    "this is particularly useful when we have a few copies of the qubit to be teleported , since after a few runs of the mtp the overall @xmath5 . on top of that ,",
    "protocol @xmath2 possesses the same efficiency of the first one but needs only _ half _ the number of teleportations to achieve the same @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that this protocol is connected to the pqt of refs .",
    "protocol @xmath3 , on the other hand , in addition to requiring just half the number of teleportations of protocol @xmath1 also achieves the highest @xmath0 .",
    "actually , we show that for some set of pes s @xmath6 after just a few teleportations within a single run of the mtp .",
