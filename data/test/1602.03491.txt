    "we study the problem considering two different perspectives , namely a homogeneous and cluster - mf ansatz .      in order to further simplify the mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) ,",
    "it is reasonable to use the typical mf ansatz , namely that , due to translational symmetry in either direction of the 2d array ( along rows or columns ) , the corresponding cavity fields are the same ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 for all @xmath131 ) as well as the spins , @xmath132 .",
    "we can now proceed along similar lines as in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] in order to characterize the solutions . in analogy to sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] we start with @xmath88 and we neglect the spin decay for the moment , @xmath133 . considering @xmath134 and @xmath135 for all @xmath131 to be the same along rows or columns , the steady state mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) simplify to    [ eq : mf 2d ass ] @xmath136    here @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) is the number of rows ( columns ) respectively . since the fields @xmath139 and @xmath114 share the same spin @xmath140 , @xmath139 can be given directly in terms of the field @xmath114 .",
    "the situation is then essentially equivalent to the single cavity case analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : single cavity ] , though with some extra tunability provided by larger number of parameters .",
    "for example , one can find the transition point @xmath110 by combining ( [ eq : mf 2d ass a ] ) and ( [ eq : mf 2d ass b ] ) with @xmath141 , which is one possible solution of ( [ eq : mf 2d ass s ] ) .",
    "the transition point then corresponds to the situation where @xmath65 , i.e. |s|^2 = =    @xmath142 for all other parameters fixed . as a consistency check ,",
    "it is easy to verify that one recovers the single cavity expression @xmath143 by omitting all the `` @xmath144 '' variables and setting @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the number of spins .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have used the homogeneous mf ansatz and found that the solutions correspond effectively to a single cavity case with no intriguing spin configurations .",
    "however , it is known and was shown e.g. in @xcite , that a suitable mf ansatz can lead to a non - trivial configuration ( such as antiferromagnetic ordering ) even if the steady state mf equations are completely symmetric under exchange of the spin variables . here",
    "we will consider the simplest possible case of such ansatz where a cluster is formed by two adjacent inequivalent spins @xmath147 and @xmath148 . on the other hand , since the fields @xmath114 and @xmath139 couple to both @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the same way , we take @xmath151 to be the same along rows ( columns ) due to translational symmetry . in order to simplify the equations , we now take all the parameters to be the same along all rows and columns ( i.e. we set @xmath152 and @xmath153 for all @xmath154 ) . starting with the simplest case @xmath88 , the mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) become    [ eq : mf 2d symm ] @xmath155 - i \\gamma \\left ( w_{\\bar{j } } + \\mathds{1 } \\right ) \\label{eq : mf 2d symm sz},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath156 labels the different spins of the cluster and we assumed that each field @xmath151 couples to the same number of spins 1 and 2 , hence the factor @xmath157 in the second term of ( [ eq : mf 2d symm a]),([eq : mf 2d symm b ] ) . here @xmath49 denotes the total number of spins , i.e. there are @xmath158 spins along rows and along columns .",
    "until now we did not comment on the spin conservation in the 2d case .",
    "going back to the most general situation , where every individual spin and cavity mode is described in terms of the corresponding mf variables @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively , the system evolves according to the full set of the 2d mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) .",
    "one can verify by means of ( [ eq : diff spin conservation ] ) that ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) actually imply both local w_|i |^2 + 4 | s_|i |^2 |^2 = 1 ,     @xmath133 . in ( [ eq : spin conservation global ] ) @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the global spin components .",
    "one should appreciate that ( [ eq : spin conservation global ] ) actually prevents any spin configuration incompatible with it , including the af order ( which corresponds to @xmath163 when using the here considered cluster - mf ) . in order to see e.g. the af order , such as in @xcite",
    ", one needs to break the global spin conservation .",
    "this is achieved by the inclusion of the spin decay @xmath126 , which breaks both the local and global spin conservations ( [ eq : spin conservation local]),([eq : spin conservation global ] ) .",
    "allowing for the spin decay , we can now ask , whether the solution of the cluster - mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d symm ] ) features any non - trivial spin configuration ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "first , it follows from ( [ eq : mf 2d symm a ] ) and ( [ eq : mf 2d symm b ] ) that @xmath165 .",
    "next , expressing for @xmath166 from ( [ eq : mf 2d symm s ] ) and substituting to ( [ eq : mf 2d symm sz ] ) , it can be shown that = w_1 = w_2 and @xmath167 from ( [ eq : mf 2d symm s ] ) .",
    "once again we find that the structure of the equations ( [ eq : mf 2d symm ] ) reduces the problem effectively to the single cavity situation described by a simple set of variables @xmath168 and this even when allowing for inequivalent spin configurations and the spin decay .",
    "one might argue , that the equivalence to the single cavity case conjectured in sections [ sec : asym array ] and [ sec : symm array ] is an artefact of taking @xmath169 . indeed ,",
    "when comparing ( [ eq : eoms mf ] ) and ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) , one can note that there is a _ qualitative _ difference between the 1d and 2d situation .",
    "specifically , there is an extra coupling between the @xmath0 and @xmath144 modes , the last term in ( [ eq : mf 2d a ] ) and ( [ eq : mf 2d b ] ) .",
    "we have numerically verified that , in a general situation with variables @xmath170 , @xmath156 and @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , the solutions always yield @xmath174 . for completeness",
    "we have included in our numerical analysis also the special cases , where any possible combination of the following conditions can occur : @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath53 .    in summary , the mf equations ( [ eq : mf 2d ] ) with the ansatz considered in sections [ sec : asym array ] and [ sec : symm array ] on a square lattice reduce to effectively one - dimensional description with no intriguing spin configurations .",
    "it would be desirable to perform a beyond mf study of the non - linear two - dimensional model in order to asses the true nature of the steady state and the corresponding spin and field configurations , including their mutual correlations .",
    "also we did not fully exploit the possibilities offered by the proposed implementation , such as taking different geometries of the array or allowing for disordered coupling strengths , which we leave for further investigations .",
    "motivated by the progress in integrated optical circuits , we have proposed a possible realization of a two - dimensional cavity array with trapped atoms , which is a promising scalable quantum architecture .",
    "we derived an effective description of the system in terms of jaynes - cummings like hamiltonian with highly tunable parameters and extra non - linear terms .",
    "we then analyzed the dynamics of the system using a mf approach .",
    "we have found a rich behaviour including bistable regions , ising like phase transition or occurrence of limit cycles through hopf bifurcations . in the present setup ,",
    "we have not found conceptual differences between the one and two - dimensional cases at the level of the mf description and with the geometry considered .",
    "we hope that the present work lays down grounds for future studies of the cavity arrays realized with integrated optical circuits .",
    "the problems which might be addressed in the future are e.g. going beyond mf description , accounting for more exotic geometries or studying effective spin physics as a low energy limit of the presented cavity hamiltonian .",
