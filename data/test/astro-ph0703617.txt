    "there is now considerable observational evidence for a high degree of structure , or `` clumping '' , in hot stellar winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if not taken into account , the inferred mass - loss rates may be substantially above their actual values . for wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ,",
    "the assumption of a smooth wind typically leads to a factor of 3 overestimate .",
    "recent studies are now indicating that the winds of main sequence stars may be even more structured , and downward revisions in @xmath0 by factors of @xmath2 or more have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such substantial reductions have a dramatic effect on the evolution and environmental impact of massive stars , and may also be needed to explain the near - symmetry of x - ray lines @xcite .",
    "several methods for determining mass - loss rates which are not sensitive to @xmath3 are unique to binary systems .",
    "first , if the period of the binary is short enough , and the mass - loss rates high enough , @xmath0 can be determined from the observed change in the orbital period . though this has been applied to the wr binary v444  cyg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has limited applicability .",
    "observed changes in polarization and atmospheric continuum eclipses can also be used to determine mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 have also been made by comparing the observed x - ray flux arising from the wcr to predictions from hydrodynamical models of this interaction @xcite . in all of these models",
    "homogeneous winds were assumed , but this work shows that structured winds are rapidly smoothed out in the wcr of _ wide _ binaries : hence , the x - ray emission , despite being sensitive to @xmath3 , is an excellent diagnostic of the actual mass - loss rates .",
    "further implications of wind structure on the interaction region are discussed in   [ sec : implications ] .",
    "the survival time of a clump within the wcr depends predominantly on its size and density contrast to the mean flow .",
    "the low amplitude of detected variability argues for a large number of clumps , each of which is likely to have a quite small spatial scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the interclump medium is devoid of material , the density contrast of the clumps relative to the corresponding smooth flow is inversely related to the volume filling factor , @xmath4 , which the clumps occupy .",
    "@xmath5 initially decreases with radius ( i.e. the wind becomes increasingly clumpy ) , reaches a minimum at around @xmath6 , and then declines as the wind slowly smooths out @xcite . at very large distances",
    ", @xcite find that @xmath7 .",
    "clumps which pass into the wcr lose mass primarily through dynamical instabilities ( e.g. kelvin - helmholtz ) .",
    "the destruction timescale of non - radiative clumps can be parameterized as @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the clump radius and @xmath10 is the shock velocity ( for the stationary shocks in cwbs , @xmath10 is equal to the normal component of the pre - shock wind speed ) .",

    ". a lower limit on the timescale for the clump to half cross the wcr is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is half the distance between the confining shocks .",
    "clumps will be destroyed before they reach this half - way point when @xmath15 . since it is expected that @xmath16 , clumps should be rapidly destroyed within the wcr .",
    "the long - period cwb forms the basis of this investigation into the effects of clumpy winds on the interaction region .",
    "wr140 is the achetype of long - period cwbs , exhibiting dramatic variations in its x - ray @xcite and radio emission @xcite modulated by its highly eccentric orbit .",
    "the emission from radio to tev energies has recently been modelled by @xcite .",
    "there have been two previous studies of the clumpy colliding winds in wr140 .",
    "@xcite examined a simulation with the stars near periastron .",
    "wr material both in and between the clumps rapidly cools , and is compressed to high densities . @xcite",
    "considered the transition between periastron and apastron in an attempt to explain the variation of the x - ray flux with the stellar separation .    in this work",
    "the effect of clumpy winds on the wcr is examined when the stars are at apastron ( i.e. the stellar separation @xmath17 ) .",
    "the mass - loss rates and terminal wind speeds adopted are : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in order to focus attention on the apex of the wcr , which is bent sharply around the o star",
    ", the wr star is positioned off the 2d hydrodynamic grid , which is axisymmetric and contains @xmath22 cells .",
    "the clumps are added to the flow in annuli around each star at specific time intervals . for simplicity the clumps",
    "are assigned the wind terminal speed , and have radii proportional to their distance from their star . the clump radius , @xmath9 , is @xmath23 in the wr wind , and @xmath24 in the o wind , so that the clumps have @xmath25 cells across their radius when interacting with the wcr .",
    "the clumps are given a density contrast of 10 with respect to the interclump medium , and the clump and interclump medium are assumed to contain equal mass ( hence @xmath26 ) .",
    "the inter - clump medium is perfectly smooth .",
    "a simulation with smooth winds reveals that the width of the wcr on the line between the centers of the stars is @xmath27 .",
    "hence @xmath28 ( 0.25 ) for the clumps in the wr ( o ) wind , and the wcr should quickly smooth out these inhomogeneities .    the hydrodynamical code is second - order accurate in space and time @xcite .",
    "optically thin radiative cooling is included , though radiation losses are negligible .",
    "heat conduction is not explicitly included , and is likely to be strongly inhibited by the magnetic field revealed by the synchrotron emission .",
    "the clumps are initially spherical , but the velocity dispersion in the radial and transverse directions may differ .",
    "@xmath29 for the clumps in the o wind , so that they naturally `` pancake '' as they are advected by the wind .",
    "recent models of x - ray wind absorption support radially compressed rather than spherical clumps @xcite .",
    "the density contrast of the clumps is also reduced by numerical diffusion .",
    "these two effects reduce the survival time of the clumps , but are not thought to be significant .",
    "+    a density plot of the wcr is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcr]a ) .",
    "it is immediately evident that the process of clump destruction induces a multitude of large and small scale motions within the wcr .",
    "this `` turbulence '' , some of which is supersonic ( figs .",
    "[ fig : wcr]b and  [ fig : massvs]a ) , puffs - up the wcr , so that its volume is 25% larger than the homogeneous case . temperatures higher than in the smooth - wind case occur when the wcr expands upstream into the relatively low ram - pressure of the interclump medium , and also behind the bow - shocks driven ahead of the clumps .",
    "in contrast , the interiors of clumps are initially heated to significantly lower temperatures as shocks driven into them are much slower ( shocks driven into clumps in the wr wind near the line of centers have speeds @xmath30 , and produce temperatures of @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , there is a wider distribution of temperatures within the wcr than in the smooth winds case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massvs]b ) .    as cool material within recently - shocked clumps moves deeper into the wcr it is heated by secondary shocks and through mixing with hotter plasma . at any particular instant ,",
    "the majority of the mass within the wcr is heated to temperatures similar to those that exist in the smooth winds simulation : the mass - weighted mean temperature of gas within the wcr ( and on the grid ) is @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the smooth and structured winds cases respectively .",
    "the average density in the wcr is similar to the smooth winds case , and is not markedly different with 90% of the mass in clumps .",
    "although the wcr is clearly not smooth , the wind - wind collision decreases the small - scale structure in the winds .",
    "clump disruption is mostly through the development of large scale perturbations , while the mixing of the clump and interclump material is affected by smaller scale motions .",
    "the global nature of the simulation inevitably leads to relatively poor spatial resolution at the scale of individual clumps , and is likely to enhance the mixing due to non - negligible numerical diffusion .",
    "in contrast , the lack of a third dimension in these simulations ( the imposition of axisymmetry means that the clumps are donut shaped ) should slow the rate of clump destruction as there is one less degree of freedom for dynamical instabilities .",
    "resolution tests and comparison with previous work on shock - cloud interactions indicate that these effects do not have a serious impact on the results .    in reality , clumps will possess a variety of density contrasts and sizes - large , dense clumps will survive longer as distinct entities within the wcr than smaller , less dense clumps , though denser clumps may on average be smaller and vice - versa @xcite . if @xmath34 , clumps could , in theory , pass completely through the wcr and into the pre - shock wind of the companion star , but this is unlikely to occur in the wide , adiabatic systems considered here .      since the wind structure is rapidly smoothed , it is not surprising that the x - ray emission is similar to the homogeneous case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ) .",
    "the mean continuum flux at 1  kev is only 17% higher in the clumpy winds simulation , which translates into an 8% overestimate of the mass - loss rates ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "clearly , there is potential to use the x - ray emission from the wcr as a diagnostic of the stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "however , the structure within the wcr and the resulting x - ray emission depends on the properties of the clumps .",
    "further simulations ( pittard , in preparation ) reveal that the emission measure ( @xmath36 ) appears to increase with the clump density contrast : an identical simulation with a density contrast of 100 yields a 56% overestimate of @xmath0 for each star , but the density contrast is unlikely to be this high in wide cwb systems .",
    "instead , the major sources of uncertainty are likely to be the abundances and the wind momentum ratio , @xmath37 ( as the emission is nearly degenerate between @xmath37 and the @xmath0 s - see * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , x - ray derived mass - loss rates should be accurate to within a factor of 2 .",
    "substantially higher precision may be obtained if @xmath37 and the wind abundances are strongly constrained .",
    "the level of x - ray absorption by the intervening wind(s ) can also , in principle , be used to determine mass - loss rates . for the wide binaries considered here the clumps are likely to be optically thin , so that the optical depth will be identical to the smooth winds case . however , again there is a degeneracy with @xmath37 if the line - of - sight into the system is not well constrained , in which case it may be best to simply match the x - ray flux at energies above those susceptible to absorption @xcite .",
    "the interaction of clumpy , as opposed to homogeneous , winds has implications for a variety of phenomena which occur at or within the wcr .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission from wide cwbs has recently been modelled assuming that relativistic electrons are created by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) at the shocks confining the wcr @xcite . in the case of wr140 ,",
    "@xcite find that the non - thermal ( nt ) electron energy distribution is harder than the canonical dsa value , i.e. @xmath38 . while there are many possible explanations , the results presented above hint at several mechanisms .",
    "first , nt particles may be accelerated via the second - order fermi process resulting from clump - induced mhd turbulence within the wcr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , particles accelerated at the confining shocks may be re - accelerated at multiple ( weak ) shocks within the wcr @xcite . a third possibility is magnetic reconnection , which probably occurs throughout the volume of the turbulent wcr , and not just at a hypothetical contact discontinuity .",
    "reconnection may also provide additional energy for generating and maintaining the magnetic fluctuations which drive stochastic acceleration .",
    "if any of these mechanisms is dominant , models which impose particle acceleration only at the confining shocks will need to be revised accordingly .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field within the wcr is likely to be highly `` tangled '' due to the turbulent motions of the gas inside .",
    "this was a central assumption in the recent models mentioned above , and means that the asymmetric radio lightcurve of wr140 can not be explained by the angular dependence of the synchrotron emission process .",
    "there are a variety of timescales within the wcr which may be modified if the stellar winds are clumpy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in wide cwb systems ,",
    "the shocks are collisionless , and the electron and ion temperatures may differ ( an effect which appears to be sensitive to the shock speed , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "equilibration subsequently occurs through coulomb collisions , proceeding faster where the density is higher , such as in material within the shocked clumps .",
    "the spectral hardness is sensitive to this process , but the overall flux is not dramatically changed , and it is unlikely to have a significant impact on mass - loss rate determinations .",
    "ionization equilibrium may also take a significant time to occur .",
    "direct evidence for non - equilibrium ionization is seen in wr140 @xcite , and models which assume ionization equilibrium fail to reproduce observed x - ray line profiles @xcite .",
    "material originally within clumps will ionize quicker than interclump material , but to lower stages due to the reduced post - shock temperatures . the relevant timescale to obtain the highest ionization stages then becomes the speed at which further heating occurs in the downstream flow , through compressions , shocks , and mixing .",
    "the details are again sensitive to the clump properties , but the continuum emission , and thus estimates of @xmath0 , should not be strong affected .",
    "the highly turbulent interior of the wcr shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcr ] enhances the mixing between the two winds .",
    "such mixing may be necessary in order that carbon - rich wr material and hydrogen - rich o - star material can form dust within the wcr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction of clumpy stellar winds in massive binary systems creates a highly turbulent wind - wind collision region in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the lifetime of clumps within the wcr depends on their density contrast and size .",
    "clumps with a density contrast of 10 and radii a few times smaller than the half - width of the wcr on the line of centers between the stars are rapidly destroyed .",
    "material originally within the clumps is then vigourously mixed into the surrounding flow .",
    "the stochastic impact of clumps on the wcr and their subsequent destruction creates significant density and temperature fluctuations within the wcr , but the global x - ray emission can be remarkably similar to the smooth winds case .",
    "the x - ray emission is then an effective , clumping - independent , measure of the stellar mass - loss rates , especially if the wind momentum ratio is known .",
    "the small number of cwb systems suitable for such an analysis is countered by the potential accuracy that can be obtained . each time",
    "this method has been used to determine mass - loss rates , values lower than those in the literature were inferred .",
    "although only a small part of parameter space is explored here , any reasonable parameters for the clumps in the wide , adiabatic , systems considered here should lead to their rapid dissolution .",
    "turbulence and weak shocks within the wcr provide mechanisms for obtaining hard nt particle spectra .",
    "the timescale to obtain high ionization stages may be controlled by the rapidity of clump destruction , and enhanced mixing of the winds will aid dust formation .",
