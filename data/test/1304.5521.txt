    "given a curve @xmath4 , we consider the geometric flow @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the curvature and @xmath7 the binormal component of the frenet - serret formulas @xmath8    the flow can be expressed as @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the usual cross - product , @xmath11 is the time , and @xmath12 is the arc - length parameter .",
    "it appeared for the first time in 1906 in the ph .",
    "d. thesis of da rios @xcite and was rederived in 1965 by arms and hama @xcite as an approximation of the dynamics of a vortex filament under the euler equations .",
    "this model is usually known as the vortex filament equation ( vfe ) ; we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for an analysis and discussion of its limitations .",
    "equations and are also known as the binormal equation and the localized induction approximation ( lia ) , respectively .",
    "some of their explicit solutions are the line , the circle , and the helix .",
    "since the tangent vector @xmath13 remains with constant length , we can assume that @xmath14 , for all @xmath11 .",
    "differentiating , we get the so - called schrdinger map equation onto the sphere : @xmath15    which is a particular case of the landau - lifshitz equation for ferromagnetism @xcite . equation can be rewritten in a more geometric way as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the covariant derivative , and @xmath18 is the complex structure of the sphere .",
    "written in this way , can be generalized to more general definition domains and images , as in @xcite , where the hyperbolic plane @xmath19 was chosen as the target space .",
    "a relevant step forward in the understanding of was given by hasimoto in @xcite , where a transformation ( see section [ s : hasimoto ] ) that relates and with the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation was introduced : @xmath20    equation is time reversible , i.e. , if @xmath2 is a solution , so is @xmath21 .",
    "bearing in mind this fact , an important property of ( and , hence , of ) is that it has a one - parameter family of regular self - similar solutions that develop a corner - shaped singularity at finite time .",
    "this was proved in @xcite for the euclidean case , and in @xcite for the hyperbolic case .",
    "the self - similar solutions are written in the form @xmath22    as was proved by buttke in @xcite , @xmath23 is a smooth curve characterized by the geometric properties @xmath24    with @xmath25 being a constant .",
    "therefore , the shape of @xmath23 is the one of a hairpin : it looks like a segment of a circle of radius @xmath26 close to the origin , that becomes two helicoidal curves with a bigger pitch for bigger @xmath27 , and that winds around two different lines @xcite .",
    "buttke also studied numerically these self - similar solutions .",
    "later on , in @xcite , a careful numerical study of those solutions for both the euclidean and the hyperbolic cases was done . on the one hand",
    ", the authors reproduced numerically in @xcite the formation of the corner - shaped singularity , and , on the other hand , they started with a corner - shaped initial datum , recovering numerically the self - similar solutions ; in all cases , the correct choice of boundary conditions was shown to be vital .",
    "furthermore , they gave numerical evidence that fractality phenomena appeared in ( see figure 2.6 in p. 1059 of @xcite ) , if , for instance , fixed boundary conditions were imposed on the tangent vector @xmath28 .",
    "remark that the relationship between fractals and the schrdinger map equation is not new ; indeed , in @xcite , an aortic valve model was proposed , in order to study the apparent fractal character of the valve s fiber architecture . instead of @xmath2 ,",
    "the authors wrote @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , which corresponds to our time , is such that the curves @xmath31 are the fibers . after imposing fixed boundary conditions at @xmath32",
    ", they showed that the curves @xmath33 have a fractal character . besides",
    ", the fractal dimension of those curves was calculated numerically in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this fractal behavior already occurs at the linear level , as can be easily seen when solving numerically the free schrdinger equation @xmath34    with an initial datum that is piecewise constant as the sign function in , say , @xmath35 $ ] , and then extended by periodicity . the trigonometric series associated to these problems",
    "have been extensively studied and , as we will see later , the behavior at rational times modulo @xmath36 is completely different to that at irrational ones . in @xcite , berry and",
    "goldberg made a far - reaching connection of this behavior with the so called talbot effect in optics . in @xcite and in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used to model the talbot effect and showed that at rational times the solution can be obtained as a finite overlapping of translates of the initial datum , while at irrational times the images have a fractal profile .",
    "also in @xcite , a conjecture was made about the dimensions of those fractals .",
    "as far as we know , the only available results on the nonlinear setting are the recently ones obtained by erdoan and tzirakis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( i.e. equation , with @xmath37 ) , for the initial data given by piecewise continuous functions .",
    "this means that the data are `` almost '' in the sobolev class @xmath38 , that is subcritical with respect to the one determined by the scaling of the equation ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "this typically implies that the nonlinear potential can be seen as an external force .",
    "then , its contribution is computed using duhamel s integral , which has a regularizing effect . as a consequence ,",
    "the fractal behavior is due to the linear part of the solution . at this point ,",
    "the available results for the linear theory are used ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , erdoan and tzirakis , in collaboration with chousionis , have also studied in @xcite the schrdinger map equation , but still with subcritical initial conditions .    in this paper , we are interested in filaments with corners .",
    "this means to consider delta functions as the initial data for or piecewise continuous functions as the initial data for .",
    "therefore , we work with data in critical spaces and the problem turns out to be much more involved .",
    "the case of an infinite curve with just one corner and that is otherwise smooth has been studied in the sequence of papers @xcite by banica and vega .",
    "one of the conclusions is that is in fact ill - posed for this type of initial conditions , so that is also ill - posed if it is understood in a classical sense .",
    "however , after introducing appropriate function spaces and using the appropriate definition of solution , it is proved that and are well - posed for this type of initial condition .",
    "more concretely , the velocity at the point where the corner is located is determined by the self - similar solution that at time zero has a corner with the same angle .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was proved that there exists just one self - similar solution with this property .",
    "even if the solutions of for an initial datum with a corner are well understood , nothing had been done for more general initial data with several corners , in particular , polygons .",
    "nevertheless , in two recent papers @xcite by jerrard and smets , they prove a global existence theorem that allows to consider such types of initial data .",
    "moreover , they simulate numerically the evolution of the unit square at different times , suggesting that the solution could become again polygonal ; indeed , at a certain time , the square seems to reappear , but with the axes turned by a @xmath40-angle with respect to the initial ones . in the following pages , we will show not only that these observations are correct , but that , given a regular planar polygon with @xmath41 sides as the initial datum , another polygon is obtained at times of the form @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , we will give a complete description of this polygon ; in particular , and except for @xmath44 , we will see that it is a skew polygon with @xmath45 sides ( if @xmath46 odd ) , or @xmath47 sides ( if @xmath46 even ) .",
    "one could wander what , if any , is the connection of these solutions with real fluids . of course , one can not expect anything at the quantitative level , because da rios and arms and hama s approximations are based first in a truncation of the biot - savart integral and then in a renormalization of the time variable .",
    "however , using vfe as an approximation of the evolution of real filaments can not be ruled out at the qualitative level , even with data as singular as the ones we consider .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , the similitude between the self - similar solutions and a flow traversing a triangular wing is pointed out ( see figure 1.1 in p. 1051 of that paper ) .    in the concrete case of the solutions considered in this article",
    ", we could ask if the macroscopic effect of the turning axes mentioned above can be seen in the dynamics of real fluids .",
    "it appears that this is something quite well documented for noncircular jets .",
    "it was first observed when the nozzle has an elliptic shape and , later on , seen for shapes given by a rectangle , a square , and an equilateral triangle among others .",
    "the interest of considering nozzles with corners started in the mid 80 s and has received considerable attention since then .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey @xcite , where the papers related to the above observations can be found , together with a detailed analysis on how sensitive the axes - turning phenomenon is to the initial geometric conditions ; and several numerical experiments are also reviewed .",
    "it has to be understood that , at the numerical level , the corners are always effectively rounded and , in real experiments , the corners are immediately smoothed out once the jet leaves the nozzle , due to viscosity effects .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior of the self - similar solutions mentioned above , because the initial corner evolves into a smooth curve with the shape of a hairpin .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of smooth polygonal structures with more angles has been appreciated for nozzles with the shape of an equilateral triangle ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) ) .",
    "also in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 10 ) , while in @xcite it is said `` ... a consistent eightfold distribution pattern is also suggested ... '' for square nozzles .",
    "similar results are obtained in the numerical simulations of @xcite ( see figure 8 in p. 9 , and p. 11 , where the @xmath48-degree `` flip - flop '' in the case of an equilateral triangle is emphasized ) .",
    "we think it would be worth studying in more detail whether or not these more complicated polygonal structures appear in noncircular jet flows .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ s : hasimoto ] , we review the hasimoto transformation for . in section [",
    "s : xt ] , we gather the main theoretical arguments that support our numerical experiments in the form of a theorem .",
    "we start recalling in section [ s : formulation ] some elementary geometric symmetries that regular polygons have and that are preserved by vfe . on the one hand",
    ", those symmetries greatly simplify the numerical implementation and , on the other hand , they play a fundamental role in computing some important quantities that govern the dynamics of regular polygons .",
    "then , in section [ s : galilean ] , we pay especial attention to a group of symmetries that , as far as we know , can only be visualized through the use of the hasimoto transformation and the nls equation .",
    "they are the so - called galilean transformations , and leave invariant the set of solutions of vfe .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite , where the solution of the nls equation that has the delta function as an initial condition is characterized by the fact that it leaves invariant all the galilean transformations ; this property determines the solution , except for one function of time that is easily computed by solving a simple ode and choosing @xmath49 in appropriately . in our case , we take a planar regular polygon with @xmath41 sides as the initial datum . then , as in @xcite , the solution of is determined except , again , by a function that depends on time ; but , in this case , it is very delicate how to specify this function and does not seem to be easy . our approach in this paper is to integrate the frenet - serret frame with @xmath50    where @xmath51 , which is in this case a distribution , is obtained from the hasimoto transformation .    in section [ s : rational ] , we evaluate @xmath52 at times @xmath53 that are rational multiples of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath42 , @xmath55 , because @xmath56 takes then the form , so the corresponding curve is a skew polygon with @xmath45 sides , for @xmath46 odd , and with @xmath47 sides , for @xmath46 even .",
    "remark that the structure of the polygon is determined by the generalized quadratic gau sums @xmath57 appearing in ( see [ s : gausssums ] ) ; in particular , when @xmath46 is even , half of the sums are zero , which ultimately explains why the polygon has @xmath47 sides in that case , instead of @xmath45 .    the value @xmath58 is obtained in section [ s : recovering ] , by imposing the condition that the polygon has to be closed . as a consequence , the tangent vector @xmath28 is determined , except for a rotation that can depend on time . this rotation is computed in section [ s : rigid ] by using the extra symmetries that are available for regular polygons and that we have already mentioned .",
    "the next step is to integrate @xmath28 , in order to obtain the corresponding skew polygon @xmath59 at rational times .",
    "using again the symmetries , we are able to calculate all the necessary quantities , except for some vertical translation of @xmath59 that can be easily computed numerically ( although we do not see a simple way of doing it by using just theoretical arguments ) .    in section [ s : numerical ] , we propose a numerical method for and . in section [",
    "s : symmetries ] , we explain carefully how to take advantage of the symmetries of @xmath59 and @xmath28 for the types of solutions considered , which leads to a dramatically improvement in the computational cost , as explained in section [ s : cost ] .    in section [ s : experiments ] , we perform numerical experiments , simulating the evolution of and for different numbers of initial sides @xmath41 .",
    "concerning the vertical translation of @xmath59 , we give strong evidence that the center of mass of @xmath59 moves upward with a constant speed @xmath60 that depends on @xmath41 .",
    "we compare the numerical results with the algebraic values from section [ s : xt ] , obtaining a complete agreement between both ( totally different ) approaches .",
    "in section [ s : riemann ] , we study the evolution of @xmath2 , for @xmath61 . at this point , it is important to recall the invariances of the so - called jacobi theta function , closely related to : @xmath62    this function is precisely the solution of the free schrdinger equation with a one - periodic delta as the initial condition .",
    "therefore , the galilean transformations still hold in this case ; moreover , they also imply the extra symmetry @xmath63    which , together with the periodicity property @xmath64 , generates the so - called unimodular subgroup .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , all these symmetries are used to prove the existence of a continuum range of exponents for the hlder regularity of @xmath65,\\ ] ]    whose real part is precisely riemann s non - differentiable function . more concretely , in @xcite , it was proved that riemann s non - differentiable function is a multifractal ( see also @xcite , where other relevant trigonometric sums are considered ) . in other words , it was proved that the set of times @xmath11 that have the same hlder exponent is a fractal with a dimension depending on the hlder exponent , in such a way that the conjecture stated by frisch and parisi in @xcite is fulfilled ( see also @xcite , for more details at this respect and the connection of this question with fully developed turbulence and intermittency ) .",
    "we could ask if something similar to the properties of riemann s non - differentiable function also holds in our case .",
    "it is very easy to find the analogous formulas to in out setting .",
    "in fact , for a given number of initial sides @xmath41 , if we write @xmath66 , bearing in mind the symmetries of the problem , we conclude that @xmath3 is a planar curve , so we identify the plane where it lives with @xmath67 and define @xmath68    this curve , or , more precisely , @xmath69 , can be seen as a nonlinear version of . is @xmath70 a multifractal ? if the answer is positive , what is its spectrum of singularities in the sense of @xcite ?",
    "we deem these two questions rather challenging from both a numerical and an analytical point of view .",
    "the results of section [ s : riemann ] strongly suggest that the answer to the first question is positive .",
    "in fact , after computing @xmath69 for different @xmath41 , and measuring the difference in the @xmath71-norm between it and an appropriately scaled and rotated version of @xmath72 , the convergence rate is rather strong .",
    "we also give some numerical evidence that the hlder exponent of @xmath70 is @xmath73 for rational times @xmath53 ; nevertheless , how the constants depend of the denominator @xmath46 , which is a fundamental ingredient in the arguments in @xcite , is unclear .",
    "this question deserves a much more detailed analysis that we plan to make in a forthcoming paper .    in section [ s : fractalst ]",
    ", we study some interesting fractality phenomena associated to the tangent vector @xmath28 . in section [",
    "s : conclusions ] , we draw the main conclusions , as well as some open questions that we postpone for the future . finally , to conclude this paper , we offer in [ s : gausssums ] a detailed study on the generalized quadratic gau sums .",
    "a central point of this paper is the natural connection between - and the nls equation .",
    "indeed , applying the hasimoto transformation @xcite to : @xmath74    the function @xmath75 satisfies the nls equation @xmath76    where @xmath49 is a certain real constant that depends on time . nevertheless , for our purposes",
    ", it is not convenient to work with the torsion @xmath77 . instead",
    ", we consider another version of the frenet - serret trihedron ; it is easy to check that all its possible generalizations have the form @xmath78    for some vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 that form an orthonormal base with the tangent vector @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , we can make , without loss of generality , one of the coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 , or @xmath83 equal zero .",
    "if we choose @xmath84 , denoting @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we recover the habitual trihedron . on the other hand , in this paper ,",
    "we choose @xmath87 , in order to avoid working with the torsion . in that case",
    ", the hasimoto transformation takes the form @xmath88    where @xmath89    it is quite straightforward to check that this new definition of @xmath75 also satisfies .",
    "the key point is to combine the basis vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 into @xmath90 .",
    "since the proof closely matches that in @xcite , we omit here the details .",
    "the main idea is to work with , and , at a given @xmath11 , recover the curve @xmath2 and the tangent vector @xmath91 from @xmath52 by integrating , up to a rigid movement that we determine by the symmetries of the problem .",
    "observe that , if we define @xmath92    and integrate for @xmath93 , the new solution of is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath28 does not change .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand the evolution of for polygonal initial data .",
    "in fact , we limit ourselves to studying the simplest case , i.e. , that of a regular planar polygon with @xmath41 sides . more precisely , we prove the following theorem :    [ t : theorem ]    assume that there is a unique solution of the initial value problem @xmath0    where @xmath98 is a regular planar polygon with @xmath41 sides . then , at a time @xmath53 that is a rational multiple of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath43 , the solution is a skew polygon with @xmath45 sides ( if @xmath46 odd ) or @xmath47 sides ( if @xmath46 even ) . all the new sides have the same length ; and the angle @xmath102 between two adjacent sides is constant .",
    "furthermore , the polygon at a time @xmath53 is the solution of the frenet - serret system @xmath103    where @xmath104 , and @xmath56 is the @xmath105-periodic function defined over the first period @xmath106 as @xmath107    with @xmath108    being a generalized quadratic gau sum ( see [ s : gausssums ] ) .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem .",
    "moreover , we also conjecture that the angle @xmath102 is given by @xmath109    * remark . * from our point of view",
    ", uniqueness is a very challenging problem for this type of equations , because of the critical regularity that we are assuming in the initial data .",
    "as we say in the introduction , uniqueness has been established in a series of papers by banica and vega , when the initial datum has just one corner and is otherwise regular .",
    "banica and vega prove that uniqueness holds for the binormal equation and for the schrdinger map equation , but the cubic nls equation is ill - posed as an initial value problem with initial datum being the dirac delta function . therefore , the work of erdoan and tzirakis @xcite can not be used in our case , and the only general result for the binormal flow for data as singular as ours is so far the one by jerrard and smets @xcite , where , on the other hand , they just prove existence .      since and",
    "are invariant with respect to rotations , given a regular planar polygon with @xmath41 sides , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath1 , and hence @xmath110 , live in the plane @xmath111 .",
    "identifying @xmath111 with @xmath67 , and assuming without loss of generality a total length of @xmath36 , @xmath1 is the polygon parameterized by arc - length whose @xmath41 vertices , located at @xmath112 , @xmath113 , are @xmath114    and a point @xmath1 , for @xmath115 , lays in the segment that joints @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "observe that it is straightforward to extend @xmath1 periodically to the whole real with period @xmath36 .",
    "then , since @xmath118 , the corresponding tangent vector is the periodic function with period @xmath36 such that @xmath119    the curve @xmath1 is continuous , while its tangent vector @xmath110 is only piecewise continuous .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 can be regarded as a curve whose @xmath105-periodic curvature is a sum of dirac deltas : @xmath120    and the constant @xmath105 has been chosen in order for the integral of the curvature over an interval of length @xmath36 to be equal to @xmath36 .",
    "at this point , it is necessary to understand the role played by symmetries in and for these initial data .",
    "both equations are invariant with respect to rotations , i.e , given a rotation matrix @xmath121 , if @xmath122 and @xmath123 are , respectively , solutions of them , so are @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( in this paper , all the vectors are represented in column form ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath126 and @xmath127 , then , if the solution is unique , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , for all @xmath11 . in particular , since @xmath1 and @xmath110 , as defined in and , are invariant with respect to rotations of angle @xmath130 around the @xmath131-axis , for all @xmath132 , we conclude that also @xmath2 and @xmath91 are invariant with respect to that kind of rotations , for all @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath133    consequently , at a given @xmath11 , @xmath134 lay in the same orthogonal plane to the @xmath131-axis , for all @xmath135 .",
    "this fact has important implications for implementing efficient numerical schemes , as we will see in section [ s : numerical ] .",
    "besides invariance by rotations , is also mirror invariant : if @xmath59 is a solution of , so is @xmath136 , etc .",
    "therefore , if @xmath137 , then that symmetry will be again preserved during the evolution , i.e , @xmath138 , for all @xmath11 , or , in other words , @xmath2 and @xmath139 will be symmetric with respect to the plane containing the @xmath131-axis and the @xmath140-axis . in our case , a regular polygon with @xmath41 sides like has @xmath141 of those mirror symmetries .",
    "an important corollary that will be used later is that @xmath142 is a positive multiple of the vector @xmath143 .",
    "one of the fundamental symmetries of the nls equation is the so - called galilean transformations , i.e. , if @xmath75 is a solution of , so is @xmath144    therefore , if we choose an initial datum such that @xmath145 , for all @xmath146 , i.e. , such that @xmath147 , for all @xmath146 , then , if the solution is unique , @xmath148 , for all @xmath149 . in this paper , this symmetry is enough for our purposes ; for the full symmetry group of the nls equation , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 17.2 ) .    in the case of a planar initial datum @xmath1 for",

    "moreover , it satisfies @xmath153 , for all @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the galilean transformation holds , i.e. , @xmath154 , for all @xmath132 , and for all @xmath152 . bearing in mind the previous arguments",

    "in particular , evaluating both sides at @xmath158 , @xmath159 , so @xmath75 can be expressed as @xmath160    where @xmath161 is a constant that depends on time and that has to be chosen in such a way that the corresponding curve @xmath59 and tangent vector @xmath28 are periodic of period @xmath36 for a fixed @xmath11 .",
    "remark that , from the arguments following , @xmath161 can be taken up to a constant with modulus one , so , in this paper , we assume without loss of generality that @xmath161 is real for any given @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath162 , we have trivially @xmath163 ; then , combining and , we recover the following well - known identity : @xmath164    observe that , if we solve the free schrdinger equation @xmath165 for , we get @xmath166    where @xmath167 is the well - known jacobi theta function .",

    "moreover , from , it follows that @xmath172    for a certain angle @xmath173 that depends on @xmath174 ( as well as , of course , @xmath175 and @xmath46 ) . therefore , @xmath52 in @xmath176 has evolved from @xmath41 dirac deltas at @xmath162 , to @xmath45 deltas at @xmath53 , for @xmath46 odd ; and to @xmath47 deltas at @xmath53 , for @xmath46 even .",
    "furthermore , introducing into , and restricting ourselves to @xmath177 , i.e. , @xmath106 , we conclude that @xmath178    the coefficients multiplying the dirac deltas are in general not real , except for @xmath162 and @xmath179 .",

    "moreover , @xmath180 has to be determined in such a way that the polygon is closed ; this is done in the next section , where we show that its rather involved choice is unique , concluding that @xmath52 is periodic in time , with period @xmath181 .",
    "since the dirac deltas are equally spaced at @xmath182 , the length of the sides is the same .",
