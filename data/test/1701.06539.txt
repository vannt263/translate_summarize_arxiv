    "consider a set of objects which should be ranked on the basis of information about their bilateral relationships .",

    "we discuss a universal version of the problem involving arbitrary preference intensities as well as incomplete and multiple comparisons .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an impossibility theorem : consistency  requiring that if an object is ranked at least as high as another in two independent problems , then it is ranked as high as the other in the unified problem , too  and self - consistency  a less known but intuitive property , introduced in @xcite , which prohibits to assign a lower rank for an object with a better or equivalent performance than another  can not be met simultaneously by any ranking method on the set of all problems .",
    "domain restrictions and weakening of the properties are also investigated in order to get some positive results .",
    "since self - consistency is an axiom difficult to debate , we can not demand consistency from a ranking method . at the first glance , it is a somewhat surprising and controversial result making the aggregation of ( incomplete ) preferences impossible .",
    "one may argue that the whole concept of paired comparisons - based ranking is flawed .",
    "however , loss of consistency may be regarded as a necessary sacrifice for dimension reduction since the outcome should be an inherently transitive ranking even from intransitive data .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the connection between consistency and independence of irrelevant matches ( which requires the relative ranking of two objects to be independent of the outcome of comparisons between other objects ) : the former , together with two basic axioms , implies the latter . and",
    "independence of irrelevant matches is known to be a property one would rather not have if different preference intensities and incomplete comparisons are allowed @xcite .",
    "our discussion is strongly related to the findings of previous axiomatic analyses @xcite , and especially to the formulation of impossibility theorems @xcite .",
    "for example , the central result reveals why most popular ranking methods violate a relaxed version of consistency called order preservation @xcite .",
