    "interactions between membrane proteins are of key importance for the survival of cells as they are involved in many dynamical processes .",
    "the organization of membrane proteins into complexes and their effect on membrane shape enables for instance intracellular transport , cell division , cell migration , and signal transduction @xcite .",
    "understanding the underlying principles of protein organization is therefore crucial to unravel processes such as cell - cell signalling in the brain @xcite or disease mechanisms like membrane - associated protein aggregation in parkinson s disease @xcite .    besides specific protein - protein interactions and interactions with the cytoskeleton , protein organization in membranes",
    "is thought to be driven by a universal interaction force arising from membrane deformations .",
    "theoretical models @xcite and simulations @xcite predict that by deforming the membrane locally , membrane proteins can self - assemble into complex structures such as lines , rings , and ordered packings @xcite .",
    "observations in living cells @xcite support the existence of such membrane - mediated interactions , but have yet to provide conclusive experimental proof of their common physical origin : separation of contributions arising from specific protein - protein interactions and interactions with the cytoskeleton is extremely challenging .    further experimental indications for a universal membrane - mediated interaction stem from simplified model systems :",
    "phase - separated membrane domains are known to repel each other @xcite while colloidal particles have been observed to irreversibly stick together when attached to lipid vesicles @xcite .",
    "however , the hypothesized connection between curvature and interaction force has not been quantified to date : even the sign of the force is still under debate .",
    "existing model systems for studying surface - mediated interactions are typically based on deformations of liquid - liquid or liquid - air interfaces @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "interactions are governed by surface tension , while in lipid vesicles elastic _",
    "surface bending _ is expected to be the dominant factor .",
    "in addition , lipid vesicles are bilayers of molecules that can not exchange molecules with the surrounding medium , which makes them profoundly different from other liquid interfaces .",
    "the experimental quantification of interface - mediated interactions in lipid membranes thus requires a clean and dedicated model system .    in this article",
    ", we describe such a specialized model system consisting of membrane - adhering colloidal particles on giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) .",
    "we characterize for the first time the effect of a single adhesive colloidal particle on the local membrane shape using confocal microscopy .",
    "we find that the particle is either fully wrapped by the membrane or not wrapped at all , depending on the adhesion strength .",
    "next , we measure the interaction potential for particles in these two states and we find that only wrapped particles show a reversible attraction , which implies that the attraction is purely caused by the membrane deformation .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the bending - mediated interaction between wrapped particles result in an interaction potential that quantitatively agrees with the experimental result .",
    "since these simulations do not contain any absolute length scale , we conclude that the measured attraction caused by lipid membrane deformations is scale - independent . our combined model system and simulations",
    "therefore quantitatively describe the interactions of any membrane - deforming object , ranging from nanometre - sized proteins to micrometre - sized colloidal particles .",
    "as a dedicated model system for membrane - deforming proteins we use micrometre - sized colloidal particles ( polystyrene , in diameter ) adhered to single - component giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs , diameters ranging from ) , allowing us to study membrane - mediated interactions with confocal microscopy ( see figure [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the guvs consists of dopc lipids , which is above its melting point at room temperature , ensuring a single - phase liquid membrane .",
    "the connection between membrane and particle is realized by coating the particles with varying amounts of avidin , a protein that binds strongly and specifically to biotin @xcite , which we attach to the membrane through a functionalised lipid .",
    "the concentration of avidin linkers on the particle surface allows us to effectively tune the adhesion strength of the particle to the membrane .    by choosing different fluorescent markers for the particles and lipid membranes , we are able to visualize the effect of a single particle on a lipid membrane ( see figure [ fig : wrapping ] ) .",
    "we find that particles exist in either a completely wrapped state or a completely non - wrapped state : partial wrapping is only observed as a transient situation .",
    "non - wrapped particles are located on the outside of the vesicle without deforming the membrane ( figure [ fig : wrapping]a - c ) , while wrapped particles are protruding into the interior of the vesicle ( figure [ fig : wrapping]d - f ) .",
    "co - localization of the membrane fluorescence with the particle fluorescence further corroborates the fully wrapped state .",
    "this two - state behaviour is in agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite . using a similar approach ,",
    "we express the total energy of particle wrapping derived from the canham - helfrich energy functional @xcite : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes the membrane bending rigidity , @xmath2 the particle radius , @xmath3 the membrane tension , @xmath4 the contact area , and @xmath5 the adhesion energy per unit area .",
    "this equation states that the energy is minimized by either minimizing or maximizing the contact area , depending only on the sign of the prefactor between brackets .",
    "the value of this prefactor in turn depends on the tunable parameters membrane tension and adhesion energy .",
    "we vary the membrane tension @xmath3 by adjusting the salt concentration in the vesicle exterior . for this",
    "we discern two extreme situations : _ tense _ vesicles with a ( non - fluctuating ) spherical shape ( @xmath6 ) and _ floppy _ vesicles that exhibit clear fluctuations around a spherical shape ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the values of the surface tension have been derived from the spectral analysis of the fluctuating vesicle contour according to @xcite .    in order to vary the adhesion energy @xmath5 , we coat particles with different amounts of linker protein avidin .",
    "we measure the distribution of linker densities in a fluorescence assay ( see method section ) and relate this to the fraction of particles that are wrapped by floppy membranes ( see figure [ fig : wrapping]g and s1 ) .",
    "we find that wrapping occurs above a critical linker density of . on tense membranes we never observe wrapping of particles .",
    "our dopc membranes have membrane bending rigidity @xmath8 @xcite . in the case of floppy membranes ( )",
    "equation [ eq : e ] yields a corresponding adhesion energy per unit area of . comparing this adhesion energy to the literature value of the binding energy per avidin - biotin bond ( @xmath9 @xcite ) , we conclude that effectively only 2 % of the surface linkers are binding .",
    "this is probably due to the presence of the polymer between biotin and lipids : the bulky polymer may reduce the binding energy per linker , prevent access to some avidin binding sites , and cause an additional non - specific steric repulsion because of overlap with polymers on the particles .",
    "note that while wrapping requires floppy membranes , it is irreversible and affects the membrane tension : an initially floppy membrane gradually increases its surface tension upon wrapping particles , due to the effective removal of membrane surface area . in this way",
    ", a tense membrane with wrapped particles can be obtained as well .    the observed `` all or nothing '' wrapping behaviour provides a means to control local membrane deformations through easily accessible experimental parameters .",
    "we will use this experimental control in the next section to investigate the forces between local membrane deformations .",
    "when two wrapped particles approach within a distance of several particle diameters , we observe a reversible , long - ranged attraction between them ( see supplementary video s2 ) .",
    "excitingly , this interaction is absent for particles that are adhered to but not wrapped by the membrane ( see supplementary video s3 ) .",
    "this implies that the interaction observed between wrapped particles is purely caused by the local deformation arising from particle wrapping .    to be able to single out the membrane - mediated force",
    ", we exclude all other relevant forces on the particles .",
    "firstly , electrostatic interactions are screened up to a debye - hckel screening length of by adding of salt to the vesicle exterior .",
    "secondly , gravity is compensated with buoyancy by carefully increasing the water density with heavy water ( d@xmath10o ) .",
    "thirdly , wall interactions are suppressed by coating the coverglass with polymer @xcite .",
    "finally , we ensure that particles do not attract via van der waals forces by grafting a high density of poly(ethylene ) glycol ( peg ) to the particle surface , which acts as a steric stabilizer @xcite .",
    "we confirm with particle tracking in three - dimensional confocal images that the particles indeed do not interact or sediment ( see supplementary fig .",
    "s2 online ) .    in order to quantify",
    "the membrane shape mediated interaction , we track the membrane - adhered particles using confocal microscopy at a frame rate of .",
    "we are able to extract the 3d particle coordinates from these 2d image sequences by simultaneously tracking the vesicle , to which the particles are confined ( see method ) .",
    "the pair interaction energy is inferred from direct measurement of the transition probability matrix @xmath11 , describing the probability for particles to move from separation distance @xmath12 to separation distance @xmath13 @xcite . here",
    ", the distance @xmath14 is the geodesic distance between the points where the particles connect to the membrane . from @xmath11 a stationary probability distribution for @xmath14",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is equal to the equilibrium distribution , assuming that the hydrodynamic drag forces on the particle do not depend on their separation .",
    "from the boltzmann distribution we then determine the energy of two interacting particles , @xmath15 .    using this method",
    ", we infer the pair interaction energy @xmath15 between wrapped particles and between non - wrapped particles .",
    "clearly , non - wrapped particles do not interact , while wrapped particles show a long - ranged attraction ( figure  [ fig : u]d - e ) .",
    "the shape of the interaction potential for wrapped particles does not depend on the membrane tension , although the interaction strength is lower on tense membranes .",
    "we find that the interaction strength for floppy membranes is and that the attraction extends over a range of , which is equivalent to 2.5 particle diameters .",
    "as the interaction energy is larger than k@xmath16 t , this attraction can be observed by eye from the relative movement of membrane - wrapped particles in supplementary video s2 .",
    "the interaction force is only present for particles that deform the membrane : therefore we conclude that the reason for the interaction is the membrane deformation only and that the membrane mediates this force .    in earlier work by koltover _",
    "_ @xcite and ramos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , an attraction between membrane - bound particles was observed that lead to irreversible aggregation .",
    "strikingly , in our experiments the interaction potential does not feature this short - ranged permanent binding , but a long - ranged reversible attraction .",
    "we explain this as follows : similar to the referenced work @xcite , our initial experiments also contained particle aggregates on the membrane ( see figure [ fig : u]a - c and supplementary fig . s3",
    "however , confocal microscopy revealed that these aggregates are mediated by small ( @xmath17 ) lipid vesicles always present in guv solutions @xcite .",
    "as their membrane composition is equal to that of the guvs , they contain biotin linkers as well and thereby irreversibly bind to the adhered particles .",
    "this `` bridging '' process gives rise to a short ranged irreversible attraction .",
    "previously , these lipid structures could not be identified because they are invisible in bright field microscopy due to their small size , while they are detected easily in the confocal microscopy experiments presented here .",
    "we deliberately remove the small lipid structures in our experiments by filtration ( see methods section ) enabling us to single out the membrane - mediated interaction .",
    "we note again that lipid membranes are profoundly different from liquid / air and liquid / liquid interfaces where surface bending is negligible and surface tension effects such as capillary forces dominate . in the absence of gravity , two ideal spheres bound to a liquid / air or liquid / liquid interface do not interact , because on these types of surfaces , a sphere will adjust its height until it accommodates the wetting angle and therefore does not induce any surface deformation@xcite .",
    "capillary forces due to interface deformations are only observed for particles with an anisotropy in their shape or roughness of the particle - interface contact line@xcite . in the case of lipid membranes , however , this consideration is only valid in the limit of high membrane tension , as hypothesized recently by sarfati and dufresne@xcite . for our low tension membranes ,",
    "curvature energy is the most significant energy contribution , as will be corroborated further in the next section .",
    "analytic approximations for a membrane - bending mediated interaction in the weakly curved limit predict a fluctuation mediated attraction as well as a bending mediated repulsion @xcite , at least in the case of isotropic deformations .",
    "our attractive interaction , however , can not be caused by fluctuations since such an attraction is negligible compared to k@xmath16 t at this length scale @xcite .",
    "the repulsion due to membrane curvature should thus be dominant , but clearly can not explain the attraction we observe .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the deformations induced by the wrapped colloidal particles can not be described by linearised theory .    with non - linear field theory",
    "it is possible to calculate the interaction force from the exact membrane shape , even in the highly curved limit @xcite . without this information , however , it is not even clear whether the particles repel or attract . in the limit of asymptotically flat membranes ,",
    "@xcite computed the interaction energy explicitly by numerically solving the membrane shape equation .",
    "they found an attraction with a well depth of the interaction potential on the same order of magnitude as in our experiments , , albeit with an additional energy barrier at longer ranges .",
    "to more closely resemble our experimental system , we therefore performed computer simulations on spherical membranes with fixed area .",
    "to investigate the origin of the observed membrane mediated interaction , we simulate the interaction between two particles adhered to a spherical fluid membrane .",
    "our approach is based on earlier work by ari and cacciuto @xcite and is explained in detail in the method section . in short , we describe the vesicle using a dynamically triangulated network consisting of 5882 vertices . between the vertices we apply hard - core repulsion such that the minimum edge length of the network is @xmath18 .",
    "the fluid nature of the membrane is taken into account by allowing the edges of this network to flip .",
    "the vesicle itself , in equilibrium , forms a sphere of diameter @xmath19 .",
    "we introduce two colloidal particles with diameter @xmath20 , chosen such that the @xmath21 ratio is similar to the experimental value .",
    "having set the volume and surface area of the vesicle to the target values , we apply an adhesion potential between the attractive part of the particles ( which in our system is about @xmath22 of the particles total area ) and the vertices in the vesicle to let the membrane wrap around the particles .",
    "we use a monte carlo annealing algorithm to identify the equilibrium shape of the membrane for different positions of the particles .",
    "note that there is no absolute length scale involved in these simulations .",
    "as shown in figure  s4 , once the particles are wrapped by the membrane , the adhesion energy and degree of wrapping remain constant , but the curvature energy depends on the separation between the particles . the excess energy of the membrane for different separations @xmath14 is shown in figure  [ fig : simulation ] , together with the experimental data .",
    "we find that the curvature energy of the membrane favours attraction between the particles for distances @xmath23 , in excellent agreement with the experimental results . for larger distances the energy of the vesicle is barely affected by a change of the separation between the particles .",
    "the minimum distance is set by the resolution of our coarse grained description of the membrane : at @xmath24 we can be sure to always have two layers of vertices between the particles .",
    "because of this limitation our simulations can not capture the short - range effects observed in the experiment as well as in the higher resolution simulations of reynwar _",
    "et al . _",
    "in contrast to earlier work , however , our simulations do take the overall curved shape of the vesicle into account , as well as the fact that it is a closed surface with fixed area and enclosed volume .",
    "for these conditions , we find that there is no long - range repulsion between the particles , in contrast to some earlier numerical predictions on asymptotically flat membranes  @xcite .",
    "the observed attraction is entirely due to a decrease in the bending energy of the membrane upon approach of the particles and is quantitatively agreeing with our experimental results on vesicles .",
    "we established an experimental system of particles adhering to giant unilamellar vesicles that enables quantitative measurement of interactions mediated by lipid membrane curvature . for individual membrane - adhering particles",
    ", we showed that there are only two states of membrane deformation : a non - wrapped and a fully wrapped state .",
    "this `` all - or - nothing '' behaviour is controlled by the particle - membrane adhesion strength and membrane tension , which agrees with a simple model based on bending , tension and adhesion energies .",
    "the two - state particle wrapping allows us to selectively measure the effect of local membrane deformations on the pair interaction . for two membrane - wrapped particles",
    ", we observed a reversible attraction of three times the thermal energy over a distance of several microns .",
    "as the interaction is absent for non - wrapped particles , we conclude that it is mediated by the lipid membrane and originates solely from the particle - induced membrane deformation .",
    "to further probe the underlying physical cause of this attraction , we used a coarse - grained numerical model and monte carlo method from which we determined the interaction energy between two wrapped particles .",
    "apart from the geometry and bending modulus of the membrane , which we respectively set to the experimental and literature values , the model requires no adjustable parameters .",
    "the energy profile we obtained from our simulations is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experiments .",
    "in particular , we find a long - ranged attraction between the wrapped particles , which is entirely due to a decrease in the bending energy of the membrane as the two particles approach each other .",
    "as the observed interaction is determined by bending energy only , there is no absolute length scale involved in the simulations .",
    "this implies that the membrane curvature mediated force equally applies to the described colloidal particles as well as to membrane proteins such as proteins containing a bar domain@xcite .",
    "in fact , our experimental measurements quantitatively model protein interactions on closed membranes , as long as the helfrich energy description holds .",
    "more local membrane deformations induced by for instance transmembrane proteins@xcite might also deform the membrane in a similar fashion , but on a length scale comparable to the membrane thickness .",
    "in this case the membrane can not be described anymore by a two - dimensional surface , and consequently other effects such as membrane thickness modulations@xcite could lead to interactions . on the other hand , aggregates of transmembrane proteins may again act as larger membrane - deforming objects that are described by our model .",
    "to more closely mimic biological systems , lipid membranes with multiple components and colloidal particles with anisotropic shapes or adhesion patches may be employed in the future .",
    "multi - component membranes may locally phase - separate and affect the measured interaction potential through an intricate process : the object - induced curvature may influence the local membrane composition@xcite and thus spatially modulate the elastic constants of the membrane .",
    "a preference of the particle for a particular phase may further induce a local phase - separation that adds an additional force driven by the line tension of the phase boundaries@xcite . besides multi - component membranes , colloidal particles with anisotropic shapes or site - specific adhesion patches may be used to mimic the complicated deformation profiles of proteins .",
    "these additional complexities will enable quantitative modeling of the interaction profile between membrane proteins of various geometries and thus further improve our understanding of cellular processes that involve membrane - shaping proteins .",

    "<S> the interplay of membrane proteins is vital for many biological processes , such as cellular transport , cell division , and signal transduction between nerve cells . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical considerations have led to the idea that the membrane itself mediates protein self - organization in these processes through minimization of membrane curvature energy . here , we present a combined experimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions directly for the first time . in our experimental model system </S>",
    "<S> we control the deformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles . using confocal microscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive interaction force leading to reversible binding . </S>",
    "<S> the attraction extends over 2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal energy ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> coarse - grained monte - carlo simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured interaction is independent of length scale . </S>",
    "<S> our combined experimental and numerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for interactions between any membrane - deforming objects , from nanometre - sized proteins to micrometre - sized particles . </S>"
