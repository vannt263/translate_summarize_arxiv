    "@xcite , although using strong coupling , has adopted an assumption about the structure of the scattering matrix , that the mixing of the states arriving from different reservoirs is weak .",
    "this led to a substantially reduced effect of nonequilibrium noise , which only appeared as a small correction to the power - law exponent in the transition rates .",
    "the differences between the assumptions and the findings of these works and ours essentially highlight the exceptionality of the situation where strong coupling is combined with the non - gaussian noise .    it should be also noted that a number of exact solutions of the fes problem exist in various systems @xcite , but they all require the use of highly complex methods that may obscure the physics , such as in ref .",
