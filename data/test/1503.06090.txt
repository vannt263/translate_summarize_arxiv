    "small spin systems or magnetic nanoparticles ( mnps ) , like single molecular magnets , nanowires or nanotubes behave very different from magnetic bulk material , which makes them very interesting , both for basic research and applications , ranging from spintronics and spin - based quantum information processing to industrial use of ferrofluidic devices and biomedical applications @xcite . due to their nanoscale size , mnps have very small magnetic moments , which does not allow to use standard magnetic characterization techniques for the investigation of their properties . in one approach , which has been pioneered by wernsdorfer _",
    "@xcite , mnps are placed very close to miniaturized superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , often referred to as microsquids or nanosquids @xcite , and the magnetization reversal of mnps is measured directly via the change of stray magnetic flux coupled to the microsquids or nanosquids .",
    "major challenges for this application are the development of squids ( i ) with ultra - low flux noise , which can be achieved via the reduction of the inductance @xmath3 of the squid loop and ( ii ) which can be operated in very large magnetic fields ( up to the tesla range ) , without significant degradation of their noise performance .    the most common approach for the realization of direct current ( dc ) nanosquids uses two constriction - type josephson junctions ( cjjs ) intersecting the squid loop @xcite .",
    "in this case , optimum coupling between a mnp and the nanosquid is achieved by placing the particle directly on top of one of the cjjs .",
    "the use of cjjs offers the possibility to operate the squids in strong magnetic fields .",
    "however , if conventional metallic superconductors such as pb or nb are used , high - field operation is limited by the upper critical field of typically one tesla for thin films @xcite .",
    "still , it has been demonstrated that by using ultrathin films , this limitation can be overcome @xcite .",
    "however , with ultrathin films the squid inductance @xmath3 is dominated by a large kinetic inductance contribution , which yields large flux noise .",
    "to date , the most successful approach is the squid - on - tip ( sot ) @xcite . with the so far smallest pb sot with 46 nm effective loop diameter and 15 nm film thickness , ultra - low flux noise down to @xmath8 at 4.2k has been demonstrated @xcite ( @xmath6 is the magnetic flux quantum ) .",
    "the inductance for a slightly larger device ( 56 nm effective diameter ) was estimated as @xmath9ph .",
    "the sot technology is extremely powerful for high - resolution scanning squid microscopy , and provided for the first time a spin sensitivity below @xmath10 for certain intervals of applied magnetic field up to about 1 tesla ( @xmath11 is the bohr magneton ) , estimated for a point - like mnp with 10 nm distance to the sot .",
    "however , maintaining the optimum flux bias point in variable magnetic field is not possible ; i.e.  the flux noise and spin sensitivity strongly depend on the applied field , which makes such devices less interesting for the investigation of magnetization reversal of mnps .",
    "an alternative approach is the use of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) dc nanosquids with grain boundary josephson junctions ( gbjjs ) for operation at temperature @xmath12k and below @xcite .",
    "magnetization reversal of a mnp can be detected by applying an in - plane magnetic field perpendicular to the grain boundary , i.e.  without significant suppression of the gbjj critical currents .",
    "the huge upper critical field of ybco in the range of tens of tesla offers the possibility for operation in strong fields up to the tesla range , without using ultrathin films @xcite .",
    "hence , very low inductance devices with potentially ultra - low flux noise can be realized .",
    "very recently , we performed an optimization study for the design of ybco nanosquids @xcite .",
    "this is based on the calculation of the coupling factor @xmath13 , i.e.  the amount of magnetic flux coupled to the squid per magnetic moment of a point - like mnp , placed on top of a narrow constriction inserted into the squid loop .",
    "this additional constriction allows for the optimization of @xmath13 ( via constriction geometry ) without affecting the junctions .",
    "in addition , we performed numerical simulations to calculate the squid inductance and root - mean - square ( rms ) spectral density of flux noise @xmath14 in the thermal white noise limit .",
    "this enabled us to predict the spin sensitivity in the thermal white noise limit @xmath15 for our devices as a function of all relevant device parameters .",
    "this optimization study predicts optimum performance for a ybco film thickness @xmath16 nm , which allows to realize nanosquids with very small @xmath3 of a few ph . for optimized devices ,",
    "we predict @xmath14 of several tens of n@xmath17 and @xmath18 ( for a mnp placed 10 nm above the ybco film on top of the constriction ) , yielding a spin sensitivity @xmath19 of a few @xmath20 .    here , we report on the realization of optimized ybco nanosquids based on gbjjs and on the experimental determination of their electric transport and noise properties in magnetically shielded environment at @xmath12k",
    ". to demonstrate the suitability of our ybco nanosquids for the detection of small spin systems , we present the measurement of the magnetization reversal ( up to @xmath21mt at @xmath12k ) of a fe nanowire with diameter @xmath22 nm , which was positioned close the squid loop .",
    "the fabrication of the devices was carried out according to refs .",
    "a @xmath23-axis oriented ybco thin film of thickness @xmath24 was grown epitaxially by pulsed laser deposition on a srtio@xmath1 ( sto ) [ 001 ] bicrystal substrate with a 24@xmath25 grain boundary misorientation angle .",
    "an in - situ evaporated au layer of thickness @xmath26 serves as shunt resistance to provide non - hysteretic current - voltage characteristics ( ivcs ) .",
    "squids with smallest line widths down to 50 nm were patterned by focused ion beam ( fib ) milling with 30kev ga ions .",
    "the au layer also minimizes ga implantation into the ybco film during fib milling .    for characterization of the device properties ,",
    "electric transport and noise measurements were performed in electrically and magnetically shielded environment at @xmath12k , i.e.  with the samples immersed into liquid he . by applying a modulation current @xmath27 across the constriction ,",
    "the magnetic flux coupled to the squid can be modulated .",
    "this allows flux biasing at the optimum working point and operation in a flux locked loop ( fll ) mode @xcite . in fll mode ,",
    "a deviation from the voltage at the optimum working point ( due to any flux signal ) is amplified and then fed back via a feedback resistor as a feedback current through the constriction .",
    "the feedback current produces a feedback flux , cancelling the applied flux signal , i.e. , the squid is always operated at its optimum working point , and the voltage across the feedback resistor ( proportional to the flux signal ) serves as the output signal . the readout in fll mode",
    "is limited by the bandwidth of the feedback circuit .",
    "if the signals applied to the squid are small enough , one can also operate the squid in open loop mode , i.e. , the voltage across the squid is amplified without feedback , and the amplified voltage serves as the output signal . in this case , the readout is limited by the bandwidth of the voltage amplifier , which is typically larger than the fll bandwidth . to determine the spectral density of flux noise @xmath28 vs frequency @xmath29 of the devices we used a magnicon sel-1 squid electronics @xcite in direct readout mode @xcite , which was either operated in open loop mode ( maximum bandwidth @xmath307mhz ) , or in fll mode ( maximum bandwidth @xmath30500 - 800khz ) .",
    "the sel electronics allows for squid operation either with constant bias current ( dc bias ) or with a bias reversal readout scheme ( maximum bias reversal frequency @xmath31khz ) , to reduce @xmath32 noise caused by fluctuations of the critical currents @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the josephson junctions 1 and 2 , respectively @xcite .     across the constriction and bias current @xmath35 across the grain boundary josephson junctions . ]    below we present data of our best device , squid-1 , with a @xmath36 nm thick ybco film .",

    "although the achieved low level of white flux noise for squid-1 is encouraging , one certainly would like to extend such a low - noise performance down to much lower frequencies .",

    ".    low - frequency excess noise , which does neither arise from @xmath106 nor from vortex fluctuations , has been reported during the last decades for squids based on conventional superconductors like nb , pb , pbin and al , in particular at temperatures well below 1k @xcite .",
    "this issue has recently been revived due to the increasing interest in the development of flux qubits and squids for ultra - low temperature applications @xcite .",

    "furthermore , defect - induced magnetism in oxide grain boundaries and related defects have been suggested to be the intrinsic origin of ferromagnetism in oxides @xcite .",
    "obviously , further investigations on the impact and nature of such defects in our devices are needed and will be the subject of further studies .",
    "such studies will include detailed noise measurements ( dc vs bias reversal , variable flux bias , temperature and magnetic field ) to characterize and understand the @xmath29-dependent noise sources and , hopefully , eliminate them .",
    "furthermore , readout with bias reversal at higher frequency up to the mhz range in fll mode has to be implemented , in order to maintain the achieved ultra - low white flux noise level down to lower frequencies . and",
    "finally , for applications of our nanosquids , it will be important to avoid degradation in time .",
    "this shall be achieved by adding a suitable passivation layer , however , without introducing @xmath29-dependent excess noise .",

    "for @xmath22 nm and with @xmath163 nm @xcite , we obtain @xmath164 , and with @xmath152ka / m we obtain an estimate of the nucleation field @xmath165mt , which is in very good agreement with the experimentally observed value .    finally , we note that the squid measurement yields a noise amplitude of @xmath166 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the detected signal upon magnetization reversal . for comparison , measurements on a similar fe nanowire by micro - hall magnetometry yielded a noise amplitude which was about one order of magnitude below the switching signal @xcite .",
    "this means that the use of our nanosquid improves the signal - to - noise ratio by about one order of magnitude .",
    "in conclusion , we fabricated and investigated optimized ybco nanosquids based on grain boundary josephson junctions . for our best device , an upper limit for the white flux noise level @xmath167 in magnetically shielded environment could be determined , which corresponds to a spin sensitivity @xmath168 for a magnetic nanoparticle located 10 nm above the constriction in the squid loop . here",
    ", the coupling factor @xmath13 was determined by numerical simulations based on london theory , which takes the device geometry into account .",
    "an obvious drawback of ybco grain boundary junction nanosquids is the frequency - dependent excess noise , which extends up to the mhz range for optimized devices with ultra - low flux noise in the white noise limit . to eliminate @xmath32 noise ,",
    "a bias reversal scheme was applied , which only partially reduced the frequency - dependent excess noise .",
    "hence , in addition to critical current fluctuations , spin noise which is possibly due to fluctuations of defect - induced magnetic moments in the srtio@xmath1 substrate is a major issue , which has to be studied in more detail for further improvement of the nanosquid performance at low frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrated the suitability of the ybco nanosquids as detectors for magnetic nanoparticles in moderate magnetic fields by measuring the magnetization reversal of an iron nanowire that was placed close to the squid loop .",
    "switching of the magnetization was detected at @xmath169mt , which is in very good agreement with nucleation of magnetization reversal via curling mode .",
