    "+ we are now in a position to write the expressions for the radiative fields . plugging eq.([asyp ] ) and eq.([inf ] ) into eq.([es ] ) we can separate the electric far field dependence into its radial and angular parts as : @xmath43 here the angular amplitude can be written as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the scattering coefficient into radiative - modes : @xmath46 in the last expression the scattered field in the far zone consists of a cylindrical wave , transverse to the direction of propagation @xmath47 , and with a net angular amplitude determined by the integral over the source region @xmath48 .",
    "the latter is actually the important bit in the formula as its squared module determines the radiation pattern . as seen from eq.([angularfield ] ) this angular amplitude results from the superposition of each scattering element taken with its own amplitude , phase and optical path in analogy to how an antenna array determines its effective radiation pattern .",
    "the radiation is given by the intensity or poynting vector in the far field .",
    "accordingly the differential angular scattering cross - section is : @xmath49 finally , the net radiative loss @xmath50 is defined as the integrated angular radiation : @xmath51      whenever the height of the defect is small enough , typically much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light , we can make the approximation @xmath52 .",
    "that allows for some simplification for the angular amplitude of a scattering element _ above the surface_. consider : @xmath53 hence , for shallow defects the green tensor dependence of eq.([asyp ] ) is entirely given by the exponential factors @xmath54 , for both a source in the vacuum semi - space and a source in the metal semi - space .",
    "indeed this turns out to be a major simplification for the relative amplitude of the scattering elements in the air semi - space , which we shall perform in detail section[hv ] . + before that we need to highlight the relation between the green tensor of a defect on the metal slab and in the metal slab , under this approximation .",
    "such relation emerges from the boundary conditions for the green s tensor at the interface , which are : @xmath55 \\cdot\\u_x=0&\\nonumber   \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath56\\cdot\\u_z=0.&\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that , in the unperturbed system , space is translationally invariant in the horizontal direction @xmath57 and this is reflected in is the @xmath57-component of the vector in eq.([vector ] ) .",
    "because of eq.([asyp ] ) and eq.([inf ] ) , we can turn eq.([gsurfacex ] ) into : @xmath58 the presence of surface charges at the interface implies , from eq.([gsurfacez ] ) , that the @xmath59-components of the vector @xmath60 on either sides of the interface have the relation : @xmath61      let us derive the scattering coefficient into surface plasmon modes . note",

    "the emission by a point dipole or a point polarization element must result into a plasmon final state : @xmath65 , as shown in the derivation sketched in the appendix [ gt ] .",

    "next we are going to develop solutions to point sources in a metal plane background .",
    "however one question may be raised : how do we associate the field induced by a surface plasmon inside a ridge or a groove to a point dipole ?",
    "the answer is the argument of this section .",
    "+ when the field inside a defect is obtained by mesh discretization we assume that the field inside a single mesh is uniform , and deviations from the field at its center are deemed negligible . yet , in general , the field in a defect , can not be represented by the field at its center alone .",
    "let us explain a little bit further this point .",
    "+ for simplicity let us consider a defect in a homogenous medium with dielectric constant @xmath74 , but the argument is the same in other backgrounds . as usual@xcite ,",
    "the field at every mesh is found by solving self - consistently a system of @xmath75 coupled equations : @xmath76where @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the field at the mesh center .",
    "@xmath80 is a term related to the depolarization of light and comes about from the quasi - static contribution of the green tensor .",
    "@xmath81 is a correction term to the green tensor in the region of the scatterer useful to improve the accuracy of the calculation , when the inhomogeneity is discretized @xcite .",
    "+ in practice , the number of mesh points @xmath75 is increased until the calculation converges to the required precision .",
    "then scale variations @xmath82 of @xmath83 are properly represented in the solution . in the rayleigh limit , for a defect of area",

    "the inset represents the geometry of a discretized circle when inscribed in a square represented by 30x30 mesh points . ]",
    "this is because for the field inside an infinitesimal ( very sub - wavelength ) circular shape is actually uniform and thus scattering by such circular defects can be described by one mesh .",
    "in fact the extinction coefficient@xcite can be derived from the field at the center alone : @xmath91=\\\\ \\label{xtn2}&= & a \\im\\left [ \\delta\\varepsilon \\e^{*}_b\\cdot\\e \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to prove this numerically we have calculated @xmath92 for a cylinder represented by a single mesh , as in eq.([mie ] ) , and illuminated by a plane wave .",
    "first of all we have checked that the one - mesh cross - section of eq.([xtn2 ] ) , coincides with the mie theory result .",
    "secondly , we have subdiscretized the cylinder into square meshes as rendered in the inset of fig .  [ cylinder3 ] .",
    "as also rendered in the figure , applying eq.([ls ] ) we found that , as the number of meshes grows , the scattering cross - section calculated by the collection of meshes eq.([xtn1 ] ) converges to the initial value of one single mesh of eq.([xtn2 ] ) .",
    "however the field inside of a square scatterer can never be uniform if it is to satisfy real boundary conditions even in a homogenous medium or vacuum .",
    "thus , it can not be faithfully described by one mesh .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cylinder3 ] , which renders the extinction coefficient for a square defect of the same area as the circle .",
    "as it turns out , the converged value is @xmath93 larger than that obtained by the one - mesh approximation .",
    "remarkably this error is not reduced with the defect size : we obtained the same error for squares with side @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "this is just for reference in the optical range , since we found that the error actually depends on type of defect and on the dielectric constant .",
    "+ however , even if the field is not uniform , a small defect in the rayleigh limit can be represented by a point source at the center of the mesh , with its field equal to the average field over the mesh @xmath96 .",
    "+ indeed if the variation of @xmath97 is negligible over the area of the defect we have : @xmath98\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the object behaves as a point - dipole @xmath99 .",
    "+ the previous results were for a homogeneous background , but they also hold for the inhomogeneous one considered in this paper .",

    "as an illustration consider a square ridge and a groove of side @xmath106 .",
    "we have calculated the scattering into radiative modes and spps without associating the defect to a point dipole but rather using eq.([sigmaout ] ) and eq.([spmas ] ) . in this case",
    "the major task is computing the green s tensor for the plane metal surface required to attain the exact field within the surface defect .",

    "when the defect is larger in the horizontal direction than in the vertical one , ridges and grooves were found to give the same scattering by an approximated rayleigh expansion@xcite .",
    "we have an alternative first principles argument to justify the rayleigh expansion result , which is based entirely on the assumption that these defects are needle shaped .",
    "the field induced in these defects tends to be that induced in a needle - shaped protrusion placed horizontally on the surface @xmath182 in the case of a ridge . for a groove",

    "of course this is just an approximation , but it explains why elongated defects have similar scattering properties . in real life",

    "this shows that eq.([needle ] ) and eq.([needle2 ] ) are quite accurate at the center of the defect , and deviate from the needle model prediction due to fringe effects at the edges .",
    "+ it is worth mentioning that this equivalence is valid in the rayleigh limit when the defect size is much smaller than the wavelength , and may be altered at resonant wavelengths .",
    "everything we just said for symmetric surface defects was based on the fact that their aspect ratio equals one . as the defect width",
    "is increased , the aspect ratio becomes larger and this leads , progressively , to an asymmetric polarizability tensor .",
    "the first effect is that the field induced is gradually less and less parallel to the incident field .",
    "therefore a ridge would develop a non - negligible horizontal electric field component , thus ceasing to be equivalent to a vertical dipole .",
    "likewise the groove , which in the symmetric case behaves as a horizontal dipole , gradually starts having a non - negligible vertical component as its shape is elongated .",
    "the process goes on until we recover the case of a needle shaped defect of section [ needlesection ] .",
    "the fields inside a defect having intermediate width , as in fig .",

    "the net angular amplitude for an oblique dipole is resolved into the superposition of the angular envelope of the horizontal dipole ( shown in fig .  [ ux ] ) , with the other radiation factor @xmath208 .",
    "this last factor contains both the orientation and phase of the field . to envisage how these combine we may develop @xmath208 into three terms . these consist in the individual emission from the horizontal and vertical dipole plus an interference term : @xmath209\\cos\\alpha &   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the presence of the plane metal background",
    ", we have that horizontal and vertical dipoles behave as individual sources but their interaction presents an intrinsic added phase difference of @xmath160 , which is due to the different interaction of a horizontal and a vertical dipole with the plane . as a result , when in phase they do not interfere , and their radiation pattern is always symmetric regardless of the orientation of the dipole .",
    "this is the case for @xmath210 where , as in fig .",
    "[ symmetric ] , the radiation pattern is the sum of the angular intensity of a vertical and a horizontal dipole , so that at @xmath160 there is a minimum due to the vanishing of the vertical dipole contribution , and yet never goes to zero because of the horizontal dipole contribution . nevertheless , when the dipole components are not in phase , we can get asymmetric radiation patterns and additional zeros ( to those at @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) , because the interaction term can be negative .",
    "in such case the interaction of the horizontal radiative field ( with only one lobe ) with the vertical radiative ( with two lobes of different sign ) is responsible for an asymmetric radiation pattern and exhibits directionality .     for a point dipole : @xmath213 , lying on top of a metal surface .",
    "the scale is linear with arbitrary units . ]",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "+ remarkably , as opposed to the the dipole emission over the surface , in the net emission from a dipole under the surface the horizontal dipole contribution has a greater weight than the vertical dipole contribution .",
    "apart from this , all the arguments used for a dipole over the surface apply .",
    "+ the interaction between the vertical and horizontal components of the field induced in the field generates the directional patterns of fig .",
    "[ rect1 ] . for a ridge with length slightly larger than its height",

    "[ dipoles2 ] exemplifies the effect of the interference of a dominant vertical component with a smaller but non - negligible horizontal component . for even larger aspect ratios",
    "the contribution from the other component may be comparable .",
    "+ likewise when a groove has a small aspect ratio it is predominantly a horizontal source interfering with a smaller vertical source .",
    "the result is in an interference pattern that looks like the one rendered in fig .",

    "our analysis of the surface plasmon scattering by square shallow defects into radiative modes and plasmon modes , reveals that a groove scatters more of the incident energy than a ridge does .",
    "the reflection by a symmetric ridge and a groove is similar and so is the radiative emission close to the horizontal direction .",
    "indeed their scattering essentially differs in the vertical direction , where a groove scatterers while a ridge does not . when defects start to become longer in width we saw the polarizability gets more asymmetric .",
    "correspondingly , since both components of the incident plasmon are out of phase , defects are equivalent to interfering horizontal and vertical dipoles on a plane , which interfere constructively in some direction , thus producing directionality in the radiation pattern .",
