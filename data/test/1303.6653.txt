    "<S> we perform a detailed study of a specific two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry , instead of a typical @xmath1 discrete symmetry , containing a very light gauge boson @xmath2 ( gev scale or below ) . the standard model ( sm ) </S>",
    "<S> fermions do not carry @xmath0 charges , but induced couplings to the @xmath2 ( called the dark @xmath3 ) are generated through mixing with the sm neutral gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> such a light @xmath2 could explain some astrophysical anomalies as well as the muon @xmath4 deviation , and has been the subject of great experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the scenario in which the @xmath5 sm - like higgs ( @xmath6 ) is the heavier scalar state , and focus on the lighter neutral state ( @xmath7 ) as well as charged higgs . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the constraints on the model from various experiments and predict novel channels to search for these higgs scalars at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , experiments looking for lepton - jets are among potentially important searches . </S>"
