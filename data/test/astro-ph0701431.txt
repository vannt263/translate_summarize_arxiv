    "the study of far - infrared ( fir ) emission from elliptical galaxies is particularly interesting because the internal rates that dust is formed and destroyed can both be estimated .",
    "dust is produced by mass loss from evolving red giant stars in the old stellar population typical of these galaxies .",
    "this mass loss is directly observed in the cumulative mid - infrared 1024@xmath1 m emission from circumstellar regions around giant stars , causing the surface brightness profiles at 1024@xmath1 m to resemble those at optical wavelengths ( knapp et al .",
    "1989 ; athey et al .",
    "the dust destruction rate by sputtering can be estimated from the frequency of thermal impacts from ions in the hot interstellar gas which for many ellipticals can be estimated from x - ray observations . during their sputtering lifetimes ,",
    "dust grains ejected from giant stars are heated by starlight and thermal electron impacts to temperatures that radiate in the fir ( e.g. tsai & mathews 1995 , 1996 ; temi et al .",
    "this radiation has been observed both by the _ infrared astronomical satellite , iras _",
    "( knapp et al . 1989 ) and by the _ infrared space observatory , iso _ ( temi et al .",
    "in addition , small optically obscuring clouds and disks of dusty gas have been detected in about half of the bright ellipticals studied with the _ hubble space telescope , hst _",
    "( van dokkum & franx 1995 ; ferrari et al . 1999 ; lauer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these clouds probably formed from dusty gas ejected from stars within the central @xmath10kpc in these elliptical galaxies ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "galaxy mergers are another obvious possible source of dust in elliptical galaxies , indeed it is widely thought that ellipticals are formed by mergers .",
    "elliptical - looking galaxies can be produced after a few gyrs following the merger of two disk galaxies ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , but this simple recipe may not easily explain all structural and kinematic properties of these galaxies ( naab , jesseit & burkert 2006 ) .",
    "many of the mergers that produced the ripples , shells and counter - rotating cores in elliptical galaxies probably occurred a very long time ago .",
    "it is likely that massive boxy ellipticals , similar to many of those with strong fir emission , have experienced mostly `` dry '' gas and dust - free mergers during the last few gyrs ( bell et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "nevertheless , mergers do occasionally occur between low - redshift ellipticals and gas - rich galaxies and these post - merger ellipticals often selectively appear in the observing lists of infrared observers .",
    "our previous study of fir emission from elliptical galaxies was based on a sample chosen from the _ iso _ data archive ( temi et al .",
    "2004 ) that included a significant number of galaxies with abnormally large masses of dust and cold gas which are uncharacteristic of elliptical galaxies in general . the large range of fir luminosities that we found in the _ iso _ sample was therefore not unexpected , and it was reasonable to suppose that mergers with dusty galaxies explained the absence of correlations between optical and fir emission .",
    "the failure to find correlations between the fir and optical luminosities of elliptical galaxies has been used in the past to argue that the cold dust is acquired in a stochastic fashion by mergers ( forbes 1991 ) .    to understand the relative role of internal and external sources of dust in elliptical galaxies , we describe here new _ spitzer _ observations at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m .",
    "our full sample consists of 46 elliptical galaxies , formed by combining our own proprietary _ spitzer _ observations with those of other observers .",
    "the improved sensitivity and angular resolution of _ spitzer _ provides clear evidence that the 70@xmath1 m emission is spatially extended in many ellipticals .",
    "in particular , we find extended fir emission in elliptical galaxies that do not contain uncharacteristically large masses of neutral , molecular or optically visible cold gas . the diffuse nature of the dust in these otherwise normal galaxies , combined with the relatively short ( ion sputtering ) lifetime for dust destruction in the hot gas , favors an internal source of dust rather than dust - rich mergers which are probably too infrequent .",
    "the luminosity of extended fir dust emission in most ellipticals greatly exceeds that expected from normal mass loss from local stars .",
    "however , small , optically thick nuclear dust clouds observed in many elliptical galaxies may provide an alternative , more plausible source for the extended fir dust emission .",
    "consequently , we argue that dust accumulated in the central regions of elliptical galaxies from stellar sources in the core is transported out to larger radii by buoyantly rising gas intermittently heated by low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the galactic cores .",
    "if this hypothesis can be confirmed in more detail , the presence of extended cold dust can be used to trace the radial circulation of hot gas in these galaxy / groups .",
    "such circulation flows are known to be consistent with x - ray observations in which very little hot gas cools to low temperatures ( mathews , brighenti & buote 2004 ) .",
    "for this study we construct a sample of 46 elliptical galaxies by combining far - infrared _ spitzer _ observations from our own _ spitzer _ data with additional galaxies in the public _",
    "spitzer _ archive .",
    "our proprietary far - infrared _ spitzer _ observations of elliptical galaxies ( pid 20171 , pi p.temi ) consists of 11 non - peculiar , bright ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) elliptical galaxies , most having high - quality x - ray observations . galactic proximity and spatial scale were also important factors in choosing this sample since high angular resolution is needed to separate emission from dusty cores and diffuse emission from truly interstellar dust spread over the galactic volume .",
    "furthermore , we avoided sources with strong radio sources and agn that have detectable signals in the far infrared .",
    "ellipticals with strong infrared milky way cirrus or bright spiral galaxies in the vicinity were also avoided . since one of our goals is to study the interaction between dust and hot gas ,",
    "we included many galaxies for which the x - ray emission is well - studied by either _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm_.    in addition to our original sample we selected 35 additional ellipticals from data currently available in the public _",
    "spitzer _ archive targeted by several pis during their general observation in cycles 1 and 2 , guaranteed time observations , and the legacy program sings ( kennicutt et al .",
    "all the galaxies added to our original sample were chosen using selection criteria tailored to our specific scientific goals .",
    "thus , the 46 galaxies studied here form a rather homogeneous sample and is large enough to be statistically meaningful .    tables 1 and 2 summarize the relevant properties of the sample galaxies including the far - infrared photometric measurements .",
    "optical data are taken from the leda catalog ( paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) and the rsa catalog ( sandage & tamman 1981 ) , while x - ray data are from ellis and osullivan et al .",
    "luminosities and distances are calculated with @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 and are derived from the flux densities in table 1 using far - infrared ( fir ) passbands of @xmath15 5.3 , 19 and 34@xmath1 m for emission at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m respectively .",
    "the pis of the original spitzer program from which the galaxies have been selected are shown in column two of table 1 .",
    "all galaxies are classified as ellipticals in the ned catalog , and the morphological type t is taken from the leda catalog .",
    "nevertheless , we shall find that our sample contains some s0 galaxies .",
    "most of the sample galaxies have known x - ray luminosities @xmath16 , which are a measure of the hot gas present in each galaxy .    of the 46 galaxies in the sample three",
    "are dwarf elliptical galaxies ( ngc855 , ngc1377 , and ngc3265 ) with @xmath17 l@xmath18 .",
    "although they are listed in table 1 , they are not included in our discussion .",
    "the data presented here were acquired with the multiband imager photometer ( mips ) ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( werner et al . 2004 ) in three wavebands centered at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath19 .",
    "since the galaxy sample has been constructed by collecting archival data from several spitzer observing programs , the image data were recorded using observing modes and integrations times tailored for their original scientific goals . as a consequence , although the maps represent the deepest fir images acquired to date , some data achieve sensitivities that are not always optimized for targets that are intrinsically faint at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "for example , three of the brightest ellipticals in the virgo cluster ( ngc4472 , ngc4636 , and ngc4649 ) recorded under a guaranteed time program ( pid 69 , pi g. fazio ) reach a relatively low sensitivity of 0.5mjy / sr and 1.1mjy / sr ( 1@xmath20 ) at 70 and 160@xmath19 , respectively , while other galaxies ( i.e. pid 20171 , pi p. temi ) have deeper maps at a sensitivity level of only 0.12mjy / sr and 0.3mjy / sr for the same two wavebands .",
    "the sings data are recorded in mips scan mode , covering a very large sky area ( @xmath21 ) , incorporating two separated passes at each source location .",
    "sings images correspond to maps with intermediate sensitivity .",
    "details on the observing strategies , field coverage and integration times for the sings program are described by kennicutt et al .",
    "apart from the sings observations , data have been acquired in mips photometry mode , allowing appropriate coverage of the sources and their extended emission . at all wavelengths ,",
    "sufficiently large field sizes were chosen to reliably measure the background emission .",
    "we used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) products from the spitzer science pipeline ( version 13.2 ) to construct mosaic images for all objects .",
    "pipeline reduction and post - bcd processing using the mopex software package ( makovoz et al .",
    "2006 ) provide all necessary steps to process individual frames : dark subtraction , flat - fielding , mux - bleed correction , flux calibration , correction of focal plane geometrical distortion , and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies were present in the final mosaiced images at all bands .",
    "these were identified by eye and cross - checked using surveys at other wavelengths ( digital sky survey and 2mass ) .",
    "they were then masked out from each mips image before flux extraction was performed .",
    "also , a few asteroids were identified and removed from the affected maps .",
    "aperture photometry was performed by measuring fluxes in suitable circular apertures around the centers .",
    "flux densities were extracted from apertures extending out to the entire optical disk of each galaxy ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by averaging values from multiple apertures placed around the target , avoiding any overlap with the faint extended emission from the galaxy .",
    "uncertainties in flux densities due to sky subtraction are generally less than 1% , but can be of the order of tens of percent for faint sources .",
    "the measured flux densities are listed in table 1 .",
    "most of the galaxies in the sample have been detected by mips , and among them a large fraction show far - infrared emission well beyond the sensitivity capabilities of previous infrared space observatories .",
    "although most of the galaxies presented in this paper are unpublished either because they are our own proprietary data or because the analysis is still in progress by the original pis , results for a few galaxies are already present in the literature ( i.e. the sings galaxies ) .",
    "we find that our flux densities are in good agreement with previously published data .",
    "the only exception is the measured flux density at 160@xmath1 m reported by dale et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the sings galaxy ngc584 .",
    "very likely this discrepancy is due to a misidentification of the target in their very large 160@xmath1 m scan map .",
    "corrections for extended emission were applied to the fluxes as described in the spitzer observer s manual .",
    "photometric errors listed in table 1 refer only to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "total errors should include systematic uncertainties due to flux calibration and to sky subtraction errors .",
    "the uncertainties on the final absolute calibration are estimated at 10% for the 24@xmath1 m data , and",
    "20% at 70 and 160@xmath19 .",
    "figure 1 shows gray - scale images of a representative sub - sample of galaxies .",
    "the column of panels on the left is the 24@xmath1 m data , while 70 and 160@xmath1 m data are shown in the center and right columns , respectively .",
    "galaxies are ordered by ascending ir flux in a common field of view of @xmath23 .",
    "some very faint galaxies are shown , including a non detection at 160@xmath1 m and few sources with extended far - infrared emission .",
    "detailed images of the diffuse extended emission in ngc4636 and ngc5044 will be presented in a companion paper currently in preparation .",
    "in figure 2 we compare fluxes at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m with optical b - band fluxes and a related plot of fir and b - band luminosities is shown in figure 3 .",
    "both the 24@xmath1 m and b - band fluxes and luminosities are clearly correlated , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the approximate consistency with unit slope @xmath26 indicates that the emission at 24@xmath1 m , like that at mid - ir wavelengths ( knapp et al .",
    "1989 ; athey et al .",
    "2002 ) , is dominated by circumstellar emission that closely traces optical starlight",
    ".    however , the huge scatter seen in the 70@xmath1m  bband panels in figures 2 and 3 suggest that this colder dust is unassociated with stars and is truly interstellar .",
    "the absence of any clear correlation between fir and optical emission from ellipticals has been discussed by forbes ( 1991 ) , goudfrooij & de jong ( 1995 ) , trinchieri & goudfrooij ( 2002 ) and temi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in principle",
    "cold , fir - emitting dust could either be diffusely distributed in the hot gas or confined to dense central clouds similar to those visible in optical absorption ( e.g. lauer et al .",
    "we discuss below our preference for the diffuse component in producing most of the fir - emission .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath3 and @xmath4 range over more than two orders of magnitude for galaxies with similar @xmath2  this is a significant new result that must be explained . in our previous survey of archival data from",
    "_ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) we found a similar spread in fir luminosities at 60 - 200@xmath1 m , but the fir luminosities in the iso data spanned only one order of magnitude for fixed @xmath2 ( temi et al .",
    "2004 ) . at the time we attributed much of this scatter to the unusual nature of the iso sample which contained many ( post - merger ) elliptical galaxies with massive disks of cold , dusty gas . now with this",
    "_ spitzer _ sample of ( mostly ) normal elliptical galaxies we find that the range of fir luminosities is even larger , although we show in appendix a that some of the fir - brightest sample galaxies can not be regarded as normal . in figure 4 we show that there is no obvious trend of dust color @xmath27 ( i.e. mean dust temperature ) with @xmath3 except perhaps a tendency for cooler dust in more fir - luminous galaxies . a similar conclusion results if we replace @xmath28 on the horizontal axis with @xmath29 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show no discernable correlation of either @xmath6 or @xmath7 with stellar balmer line ages or metallicity .",
    "however , @xmath30 may show a slight tendency to decrease with age @xmath31 or increase with metallicity @xmath32.\\ ] ] a negative correlation of @xmath30 with age would be expected since the rate of mass loss from evolving stars decreases with stellar age ( piovan et al .",
    "2003 ) , although this expected trend is not supported by our study of elliptical galaxies at mid - ir wavelengths ( temi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it must be noted however that balmer line ages for the same galaxy often show considerable variation when determined by different authors , so the anticorrelation of @xmath30 with age needs further confirmation .",
    "a positive correlation of @xmath30 with metallicity in figure 6 is expected if more interstellar grains are produced by mass - losing stars of higher metallicity .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the negative correlation at 70@xmath1 m in figure 6 , @xmath33.\\ ] ]    no correlations with x - ray luminosity with any of the fir luminosities are visible in figure 7 .",
    "decreasing fir luminosities with increasing hot gas density might be expected since interstellar grains are destroyed by sputtering which is proportional to the density of the hot gas .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath16 and gas density is unclear .",
    "for example , there is no correlation between @xmath16 and the hot gas density at @xmath34 kpc in the elliptical galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ by humphrey et al .",
    "this disconnect between gas density and @xmath16 may arise because the hot gas density on kpc - galactic scales is influenced by intermittent energy supplied by the central black holes , while @xmath16 is largely determined by more extensive gas that fills the dark halos that surround the elliptical galaxies ( mathews et al .",
    "consequently , the absence of correlations in figure 7 is not surprising .",
    "finally , we note that all qualitative features in figure 7 are preserved if luminosities are replaced with fluxes .    in figure 8",
    "we compare fir fluxes with optical emission line fluxes determined by three different observers : goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) , macchetto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sarzi et al .",
    "the optical observations require difficult background subtraction and the procedures used vary among the observers . for this reason ,",
    "we compare fir fluxes in figure 8 with each set of optical emission line fluxes independently .",
    "we believe that both @xmath35 and @xmath36 correlate weakly with observed optical line fluxes , but that @xmath37 does not .",
    "the recent sauron data for @xmath38 ( sarzi et al .",
    "2006 ) show the tightest relationship . the goudfrooij et al . data ( left column of panels in figure 8) are marginally correlated , but the significance increases if it is combined with the macchetto et al .",
    "data ( shown in the central column ) .    in figure 9",
    "we compare the fluxes in the optical emission lines with b - band fluxes , using only data for non - peculiar e or e / s0 galaxies , excluding peculiar and known s0 galaxies .",
    "the top and bottom panels from macchetto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sarzi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that the line flux is weakly correlated with the stellar continuum ( see also phillips et al .",
    "1986 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ; goudfrooij 1999 ) .",
    "a correlation between extended line emission and the optical continuum suggests that the warm gas with @xmath39 k has a stellar origin .",
    "but the quality of these difficult optical observations is poor .",
    "there are very few objects in common among the goudfrooij , macchetto and sarzi data sets , but the flux - flux plots of these common galaxies show large scatter with almost no clear monotonic relationship .",
    "five of the six galaxies in common between goudfrooij and macchetto correlate _ negatively _ in a flux - flux plot .",
    "the correlation in figure 9 , if real , may simply indicate that the warm gas and the dust associated with it both have a stellar origin ",
    "more stars of a similar age and metallicity eject more gas .",
    "however , the optical emission line flux depends sensitively on the density of the warm gas and therefore on the pressure in the local hot interstellar gas . at present",
    "there are too few accurate observations to interpret figure 9 with confidence .",
    "all ellipticals in our sample show evidence of extended emission at 24@xmath1 m similar to that of the optical stellar images  details of this will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "however , spatial extension is also evident at 70@xmath1 m as shown in table 1 , but the emission at 160@xmath1 m is not spatially resolved due to decreasing resolution at larger wavelengths .",
    "figure 10 shows the surface brightness at 70@xmath1 m for eight galaxies together with the point response function ( prf ) for the mips detector ( including the first airy ring ) .",
    "all contours in figure 10 are arbitrarily normalized to 50 at the center .",
    "the ( logarithmic ) extension in arseconds beyond the prf is best measured at 0.08 of the central fluxes , shown with arrows in figure 10 .",
    "the full width at 4/50 = 0.08 maximum ( subsequently referred to as fw0.1 m ; last two columns in table 1 ) of the prf is 37@xmath40 .",

    "1977 ) , so the coefficient @xmath61 depends on the rate that the old stellar population ejects mass @xmath62 s@xmath14 ( mathews , 1989 ) , the stellar density @xmath63 , the initial dust to gas mass ratio scaled to the stellar metal abundance in solar units @xmath64 , and the density of ( amorphous ) silicate grains , @xmath65 gm @xmath51 .",

    "we assume that all grains have properties similar to astronomical silicates ( laor & draine 1993 ) using the following approximations for the absorption coefficient @xmath70 , and for the planck - averaged values @xmath71 ( see draine & lee 1984 ) .",

    "the fit to ngc 1404 is also satisfactory , given the many assumptions in our model .",
    "while the flux at 24@xmath1 m is also shown in figure 11 , this circumstellar emission is not included in our model , but it supports our assumption that much of the diffuse interstellar dust in these three galaxies has a stellar origin .",
    "it is of particular interest to determine fir spectral energy distributions for galaxies that have accurate interstellar gas density and temperature profiles and are also spatially resolved at 70@xmath1 m .",
    "seven galaxies in table 1 have fw0.1 m greater than 50@xmath40 but only six of these are in the ellis and osullivan ( 2006 ) list of x - ray galaxies detected with rosat : ngc 2768 , 2974 , 4125 , 4636 , 4696 , and 5044 . of these six galaxies , only three ",
    "ngc 4636 , 4696 and 5044  have x - ray luminosities ( @xmath77 ) large enough for an accurate determination of the gas density and temperature profiles .",

    "2006 ) . in view of these complexities , ngc 4696 is an inappropriate galaxy to learn about the nature of fir emission from normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "we find that the observed fluxes for the two remaining fir - extended galaxies  ngc 5044 and ngc 4636  are very much larger than predicted by our steady state model for the fir spectral energy distribution .",
    "we believe that the dust in these galaxies has an entirely different origin . the large and extended fir emission from ngc 5044 and ngc 4636 , which is related to the enormous range of fir luminosities in figure 3 , will be discussed in a separate forthcoming publication .",
    "the first important conclusion to be drawn from figures 2 and 3 is that warm circumstellar dust and colder interstellar dust behave very differently .",
    "the relatively small scatter in @xmath37 in figure 2 is slightly larger than our estimated observational errors .",
    "nevertheless , we have been unable to find correlations between stellar age or metallicity and the residuals in @xmath37 from the mean correlation .",
    "we conclude that the warm dust emitting at 24@xmath1 m is largely circumstellar and this is confirmed by the similarity of optical and 24@xmath1 m surface brightness profiles which will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "the second and most remarkable result in figures 2 and 3 is that the emission from colder dust at 70 and 160@xmath1 m varies by a huge factor relative to that at 24@xmath1 m and optical wavelengths . in the previous section and in figure 11",
    "we show that 70 and 160@xmath1 m fluxes from three galaxies having well - observed interstellar gas density profiles can be fit reasonably well with our simple dust heating model without varying any of the dust parameters from those we assumed at the outset .",
    "however , notice that all three galaxies in figure 11 that agree with our model sed ",
    "ngc 1399 , 1404 and 4472  have values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in table 2 that lie near the bottom of the observed distributions in figure 3 .",
    "we think it is impossible to explain the huge dispersion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in figure 3 by simply varying the dust parameters in the sed models used for the three galaxies in figure 11 , i.e. , the stellar mass loss rate , dust composition , dust size distribution , etc .",
    "are unlikely to be in error by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "our sed model clearly fails to fit most of the fir observations .",
    "some of the large spread of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in figure 3 can be understood because our sample includes very fir - luminous elliptical galaxies that contain abnormal masses of interstellar dust and cold gas , probably acquired by a recent merger . in appendix",
    "a we review relevant observations of 12 sample galaxies having the highest 70@xmath1 m luminosities in order of descending @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude from this limited information that most ellipticals with the largest @xmath3 and @xmath4 in figure 3 can not be regarded as typical or normal . of the 12 galaxies in appendix a , we regard the following 8 as either likely s0s ( which often have extended , rotationally supported , star - forming disks of cold dusty gas ) or having massive hi or molecular lanes or disks probably acquired by mergers : ic 3370 , ngc 5018 , 2974 , 4125 , 5322 , 2768 , 3962 , and 5077 .",
    "these atypical or mis - classified elliptical galaxies are the brightest galaxies in our sample . however , we regard the following galaxies in appendix a with slightly lower @xmath3 as normal or quasi - normal ellipticals : ngc 3557 , 5044 , 4589 , and ( possibly ) 4697 .",
    "if we disregard the eight galaxies with atypical dust content , the range in @xmath3 and @xmath4 occupied by normal ellipticals is reduced from @xmath5 ( shown in figure 3 ) to about @xmath79 , but this is still larger than can be explained by varying dust parameters in our sed model . these normal ellipticals with excess fir are the most interesting galaxies in our sample .",
    "we assume that galaxies with @xmath78 significantly above that predicted by our model seds in figure 11 have dust contents that exceed those that can be understood by a steady state balance between dust creation by mass - losing stars and dust destruction by sputtering .",
    "galaxies in figure 3 with @xmath80 must contain additional cold dust from another source .",
    "this additional cold dust is either ( 1 ) spread diffusely throughout a large region of the galactic hot interstellar gas or ( 2 ) located in dense optically thick clouds similar to those seen in absorption by optical observers . in appendix",
    "b we describe a simple argument that supports the first option above , diffuse fir emission .",
    "we suppose in appendix b that the fir - emitting dust is in a small spherical cloud of radius @xmath81 located at the center of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the dust is heated both by internal stars and by starlight incident from the entire galaxy .",
    "the dust cloud is assumed to be optically thick to most stellar radiation .",
    "as the cloud radius @xmath81 is increased , the estimated 70@xmath1 m luminosity also increases because the cloud encloses more stars and intercepts more light from external stars .",
    "however , this simple dusty cloud model can not account for the luminosity range in figure 3 unless @xmath81 is so large ( @xmath82 pc ) that it would be easily apparent in moderate resolution optical images .",
    "the uv - ionized surfaces of these clouds may also be visible .",
    "while agn heating within optically thick dusty clouds could easily provide the needed fir energy , this seems unlikely since agns would need to be bolometrically brighter than the stars within @xmath81 and would therefore be seen in those ellipticals in which the dusty clouds are in disks or not present at all .",
    "such luminous agn would almost certainly be visible at other frequencies .",
    "comparisons of the most fir - luminous ( normal ) ellipticals in our sample with recent hst images ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1995 ; lauer et al . 2005 ) , show a correspondence between the absence of nuclear dust and low @xmath78 .",
    "for example , of the 19 galaxies in common between our sample and that of lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , all 11 of the ellipticals with @xmath83 erg s@xmath14 have detectable nuclear dust , while all but one of the 9 galaxies with @xmath84 have no nuclear dust detected .",
    "nevertheless , even for these galaxies with lower @xmath3 we believe that most of the @xmath78 comes from a diffuse component .",
    "in addition to the argument in appendix b , our preference for extended excess dust is supported by noting that all six galaxies with extended fir emission in table 1 ( e.g. fw0.1 m @xmath85 ) have excess fir emission , i.e. @xmath83 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "if the fir emission in excess of that expected from our simple model sed in figure 11 is from cold dust diffusely distributed throughout the hot interstellar gas , where has it come from ?",
    "it is often supposed that optically - observed dust in elliptical galaxies has an external origin , resulting from a recent merger with a small dust - rich galaxy that is otherwise difficult to observe .",
    "we adopted this explanation previously in our discussion of the excess dust in ngc 4636 ( temi , et al .",
    "2003 ) , which we interpreted as a dusty merger that occurred within the last @xmath86 yrs , the estimated sputtering time in the hot gas in this galaxy .",
    "however , it has since been determined that the mean stellar age in ngc 4636 is very old ( 10.3 gyrs , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this strongly argues against a merger @xmath86 yrs ago with a dusty , star - forming galaxy .",
    "moreover , we observe that the additional dust in ngc 4636 is extended ( fw0.1 m = 54.4@xmath40 in table 1 ) and appears to be distributed rather evenly about the center unlike the irregular distribution that might be expected to result from a recent merger undergoing dynamical friction with accompanying ram - stripping and tidal disruption .",
    "so our previous interpretation of ngc 4636 needs to be reevaluated .",
    "the dust sputtering time for grains of initial radius @xmath48 in the hot gas of an elliptical galaxy is @xmath87 yrs ( where @xmath88 is in microns ) provided the ambient gas temperature is @xmath89 k. ( draine & salpeter 1979 ; tsai & mathews 1995 ) .",
    "even if the dust is mixed with warm gas at @xmath8 k , where sputtering is negligible , its overall sputtering destruction time @xmath90 can not be significantly reduced since , as discussed below , we generally expect that the warm gas is thermally heated and joins the ( spatially extended ) hot gas phase on a time scale @xmath43 yrs that is very much less than @xmath90 .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the diffuse fir - emitting dust in our sample galaxies is in direct contact with the hot gas during most of its sputtering lifetime .",
    "the dynamical ( freefall ) time of a merging dusty galaxy across the optical image of a large elliptical is several @xmath9 years , comparable to @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , on the merger hypothesis , diffusely distributed cold dust must be resupplied by mergers in a regular fashion at least every @xmath9 yrs .",
    "therefore , an entourage of dusty merging galaxies should be commonly observed in the outer regions of the majority of elliptical galaxies having fir excess emission  but they are not .",
    "in fact , mergers between elliptical and ( small ) dust rich galaxies are rarely observed at zero redshift . while we believe that mergers do occur and that some of the most fir luminous galaxies in our sample can only be explained by mergers , the similarity of the sputtering and dynamical time scales",
    "makes it difficult to accept the proposition that mergers are the dominant or only source of ( extended ) dust in most luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "this point of view is supported by figure 5 , showing that the incidence of young stars in elliptical galaxies is uncorrelated with the fir excess luminosities seen in figure 3 .        before exploring the origin of the additional dust required to produce fir luminosities in excess of @xmath91 erg s@xmath14 ,",
    "it is useful to review the evolution of cold dusty gas that is introduced into the hot , x - ray emitting interstellar gas by mass - losing red giant stars .",
    "our sed model is based on an internal stellar source of dust which is confirmed by mid - ir observations of ( apparently outflowing ) circumstellar dust ( knapp et al .",
    "1989 ; athey et al . 2002 ; bressan et al .",
    "2006 ; bregman et al .",
    "we think that the fate of this dusty gas varies with galactic radius .    throughout most of the volume occupied by galactic stars beyond @xmath92 kpc",
    ", we assume that both the dust and gas ejected from red giant stars ultimately merge with the hot gas which is the dominant interstellar phase .",
    "we expect that gas recently ejected from stars can be maintained in pressure equilibrium at warm temperatures ( @xmath93 k ) by photoionization by uv emitted by post - agb stars .",
    "emission from warm gas at @xmath94 kpc is faint and has not been observed .",
    "eventually this warm gas thermally mixes with nearby hot gas . when the dust in this gas confronts the hot gas it will be destroyed by sputtering in @xmath9 yrs .",
    "however , within @xmath101 kpc of the centers of elliptical galaxies the evolution of dusty stellar ejecta is different . extended warm gas in this region is commonly observed , but its velocities differ from those of nearby stars ( e.g. caon , macchetto & pastoriza 2000 ) . evidently the hot and warm gas exchanged momentum when the warm gas had a much lower density .",
    "after dusty stellar envelopes and winds are ejected from orbiting red giant stars , the gas expands until its density approaches ( but still exceeds ) the local hot gas density . at this time the ejected gas , which is still moving with the stellar orbital velocity ,",
    "is disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities and shocked to a few million degrees where its density is comparable to that of the hot interstellar gas . during this period of interaction between the stellar ejecta and the hot gas ,",
    "momentum is exchanged and the ejected gas acquires some of the velocity of the ambient hot gas .",
    "even if the gas ejected from stars is ( transiently ) heated completely to the temperature of the local hot gas ( @xmath95 k ) , its dust content will cool the gas rapidly back to @xmath96 where it is stabilzed by uv from post - agb stars .",
    "this rapid dust - assisted cooling occurs because of very frequent inelastic collisions between thermal electrons in the hot gas and the dust grains .",
    "mathews & brighenti ( 2003 ) showed that efficient dust cooling of the hot gas is also faster than the sputtering lifetime of the dust , so the gas retains some dust after it cools to @xmath97 k. since the cooling time to @xmath97 k within 1 kpc is less than the dynamical time in the local ( stellar ) potential , these dense warm clouds freefall toward the galactic center and accumulate there .",
    "as dusty warm gas collects into a disk near the center , similar to those observed by van dokkum & franx ( 1995 ) and lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , it eventually becomes optically thick to the stellar uv radiation .",
    "because of its residual dust , we expect molecular formation and eventual cooling far below @xmath44 k. dense , cold nuclear dust disks and clouds similar to those observed can form naturally from stellar mass loss in elliptical galaxy cores ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "dusty galaxy mergers are not required .",
    "we speculate below that this central dust reservoir may be the source of extended diffuse fir emission in many ellipticals .",
    "central dusty clouds and disks in ellipticals are not merely an amusing curiosity , but are likely to be key to understanding the energetics of agn feedback in regulating cooling flows in the hot gas within and around elliptical galaxies . indeed , simoes lopes et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find a correlation between nuclear dust and agn activity in elliptical galaxies .",
    "consider the black hole accretion luminosity expected in a large group - centered elliptical galaxy by dusty mass loss just within the central kpc where rapid dust - assisted cooling is expected .",
    "accretion is expected to quickly follow cooling .",
    "the agn luminosity is @xmath98 ( \\epsilon / 0.1)$ ] erg yr@xmath14 where @xmath99 is the total rate of stellar mass loss within the central kpc .",
    "since a @xmath100 year old stellar population of mass @xmath101 ejects @xmath102 @xmath103 yr@xmath14 , the stellar mass within 1 kpc , @xmath104 @xmath103 , generates @xmath105 @xmath103 yr@xmath14 .",
    "when accreted by the central massive black hole , this translates into a luminosity @xmath106 ergs s@xmath14 that exceeds the entire x - ray luminosity of the most luminous galaxy groups , @xmath107 ergs s@xmath14 .",
    "consequently , dusty stellar mass loss within the central kpc of bright ellipticals can generate enough accretion energy to balance the entire bolometric x - ray luminosity of a large galaxy group .",
    "the heating of the hot gas as a consequence of this accretion also provides enough energy to drive buoyant mass circulation in the hot gas out to 5 - 10 kpc .",
    "the evolution of dusty disks in galactic cores that we just described can not continue very long .",
    "if small core disks accrete dusty gas at @xmath105 @xmath103 yr@xmath14 , for @xmath108 yrs , and allowing for a larger mass - loss rate in the past , currently observed disks should have a typical mass of @xmath108 @xmath103 and a dust mass of @xmath109 , both far in excess of those observed .",
    "( small stellar disks with masses @xmath110 @xmath103 are not commonly observed in the cores of most ellipticals , so normal star - formation is ruled out . ) a large minority of bright ellipticals show no evidence of central dusty disks / clouds . where has this dusty gas gone ?",
    "the excess diffuse dust observed in fir - emission may have been exploded out from the centers of elliptical galaxies by the release of agn energy .",
    "we estimate from our model sed that the total mass of excess dust required to explain the fir luminosities in figure 3 is @xmath111 @xmath103 .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated dust masses in the central dusty disks or lanes ( e.g. goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",
    "if the ( very uncertain ) dust to gas mass ratio is @xmath112 , then the mass of gas that initially contained this dust is @xmath113 @xmath103 .",
    "if cold dusty gas is ballistically ejected from the core out to a few kpc , velocities of @xmath114 km s@xmath14 are required . the kinetic energy needed to",
    "explosively transport dusty gas from the galactic core to @xmath115 kpc is @xmath116 ergs .",
    "although very uncertain , the energy involved is certainly larger than that of a single supernova . since multiple starburst activity in elliptical galaxies is very rare , agn energy",
    "is required for dust ejection from the core .",
    "if the agn dust ejection process is intermittent , this would explain those elliptical galaxies that are not observed to have optically obscuring dust in their cores or extended fir excess emission .",
    "the fir variance expected from intermittent agn outbursts obviates the argument of forbes ( 1991 ) and simoes lopes et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that the failure of an @xmath78-@xmath2 correlation necessarily requires an external source of dust by mergers .",
    "some explosive character to the agn - dust cloud interaction is implied by the chaotic nature of the central dust observed in many hst images ( lauer et al .",
    "this chaotic , denser dusty gas is highly transient and must have been ejected from the core .",
    "these chaotic clouds can not be understood as infalling stellar ejecta ( as suggested by lauer et al . ) , formed by the coalescence of many dusty stellar envelopes produced by individual stars , since the free fall time ( @xmath43 yrs ) to the galaxy center is too short for such accumulations to occur .",
    "however , explosive ejections of central dust to @xmath117 kpc with energies @xmath118 ergs would produce kpc - sized central cavities , strong shocks and heated cores that are rarely observed in x - ray images while extended excess fir emission is common .",
    "this may be the best argument against explosive dust transport .",
    "density irregularities and multi - temperature x - ray spectra of the hot interstellar gas in elliptical galaxies reveal buoyant activity , presumably related to a less explosive heating of the hot gas with agn energy ( buote , lewis , brighenti & mathews 2003a , b ) . in view of these x - ray observations , it is plausible that central dust can be buoyantly transported out to @xmath119 kpc , producing the extended fir emission that we observe .",
    "the buoyant rise time @xmath120 of heated gas is expected to be comparable to or somewhat less than the sputtering destruction time in the buoyant gas .",
    "for example in the galaxy / group ngc 5044 the freefall time from radius @xmath121 to the galactic center is @xmath122 yrs , based on a mass model that combines a de vaucouleurs stellar profile ( @xmath123 , @xmath103 ; @xmath124 kpc ) with an navarro - frenk - white dark halo ( mass @xmath125 @xmath103 ; concentration @xmath126 ) .",
    "the buoyancy rise time @xmath127 is greater than @xmath128 by some factor @xmath129 .",
    "> from draine & salpeter ( 1979 ) the approximate grain sputtering time is @xmath130 where @xmath88 is the grain radius in microns . adopting @xmath131 @xmath51 for the observed hot gas density in ngc 5044 within 30 kpc , the local sputtering time is nearly proportional to @xmath128 , @xmath132 .",
    "however , the buoyant gas will have a density that is @xmath133 times lower than the observed hot gas density .",
    "therefore , we see that the ratio of the local sputtering time in the buoyant gas to the buoyancy rise time is @xmath134 , which may well exceed unity considering the many uncertainties involved .",
    "the exact nature of the agn energy release that initiates buoyant activity is unclear at present . in about half of the ellipticals with optically visible dust , the images of the obscuring dust are morphologically `` chaotic '' and distributed in an asymmetric fashion away from the center of the galaxy ( lauer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "evidently the agn energy is sufficient to disrupt the dense central dusty disks and lanes which must reform again later by local stellar mass loss .",
    "it is interesting that the radii of the dusty disks observed by lauer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do not correlate with the stellar rotation , also suggesting short disk lifetimes and intermittent disruption of the dusty disks .",
    "regardless of the mode of outward dust transport , explosive or buoyant , when the dust rises to 5 - 10 kpc it may cause the hot gas to cool back to warm gas temperatures @xmath97 k. the correlations in figure 8 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the optical line fluxes , if real , indicate a connection between the warm gas and ( excess ) dust .",
    "similar morphologies of gas and dust images have been discussed by optical observers ( e.g. goudfrooij et al .",
    "although optical line fluxes appear to correlate with the fir and b - band fluxes , figure 2 shows that the fir and b - band fluxes do not mutually correlate .",
    "this can be understood if most of the fir - emitting dust comes not from recent stellar mass loss , but is transported out from a reservoir in the galactic core , which contains a large mass of dust unrelated to the the global stellar b - band flux or luminosity .",
    "our main conclusions are :    .1 in ( 1 ) the optical luminosities @xmath2 of elliptical galaxies correlate with luminosities at 24@xmath1 m ( @xmath135 ) but not with @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that the transition between circumstellar and interstellar dust occurs for dust grains with emission that peaks somewhere between 24@xmath1 and 70@xmath1 m .",
    ".1 in ( 2 ) elliptical galaxies with similar @xmath2 have @xmath3 and @xmath4 that vary over a factor @xmath5 .",

    ".1 in ( 3 ) neither @xmath6 nor @xmath7 correlates with the stellar age or metallicity of the galaxies .",
    ".1 in ( 4 ) weak correlations appear between optical line emission fluxes from warm ( @xmath97 k ) gas and @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests a relationship between dust and gas that may have cooled from the hot phase .",
    ".1 in ( 5 ) seven galaxies in our sample are clearly extended at 70@xmath1 with fw0.1 m exceeding 50@xmath40 corresponding to 510 kpc .",
    ".1 in ( 6 ) the luminosities and spectral energy distributions of elliptical galaxies with the lowest @xmath3 and @xmath4 are consistent with a simple steady state dust model in which dust expelled from stars is eroded by sputtering in the hot interstellar gas .",
    ".1 in ( 7 ) we show in appendix b that the observed emission at 70 and 160@xmath1 m can not come from small optically visible clouds in the galactic cores similar to those seen in hst images .",
    ".1 in ( 8) in view of the common occurrance of spatially extended emission at 70@xmath1 m in many ellipticals , it is unlikely that this dust can be supplied by successive mergers with gas - rich galaxies , each occurring during the relatively short sputtering lifetime of the diffuse dust , @xmath9 yrs .",
    "addiiontal supporting evidence for such mergers is lacking .",

    "in this appendix we determine if a large fraction of the fir emission from elliptical galaxies can come from small , dense , dusty clouds near the centers of the galaxy , or , as we have generally assumed , comes from fir - emitting dust diffusely distributed throughout the inner galaxy .",
    "specifically , can reprocessed starlight from internal and external stars heat small dusty regions sufficiently to account for the large fir luminosities shown in figure 3 ? we describe a simple calculation to estimate the maximum luminosity at 70@xmath1 m @xmath3 expected from a small optically thick dust cloud , including dust heating by both internal and external starlight .",
    "consider a spherical cloud of dusty cold gas with radius @xmath81 placed at the center of an elliptical galaxy having a de vaucouleurs luminosity profile .",
    "since the stellar density is greatest at the center , placing the cloud there maximizes the energy from internal starlight that can be absorbed and reemitted at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the mean intensity of starlight in an ( optically thin ) elliptical galaxy also is greatest at the galactic center , where the stellar flux incident on the dusty cloud from the outside is also maximal .    without investigating in detail",
    "how the dust is heated and reemitted in the infrared from small , dense clouds , we assume that this type of reprocessing can occur . to estimate the fraction of the the fir that appears in the _ spitzer _ 70@xmath1 m pass band , we assume that the overall infrared sed can be approximated with a modified blackbody , with emissivity @xmath183 where @xmath184 depends on the properties of the dust and @xmath67 is the dust temperature .",
    "we assume @xmath185 and @xmath186k , the mean values in our sed fits to iso ( _ infrared space observatory _ ) fir data for elliptical galaxies ( temi et al .",
    "2004 ) . the fraction of fir emission that emerges in the _ spitzer _",
    "70@xmath1 m passband ( width @xmath187 m ) is @xmath188 where @xmath189 .    to be specific we consider a typical elliptical in figure 3 with @xmath190 .",

    "( 2003 ) , we assume a typical effective radius for this galaxy , @xmath191 kpc . to determine the total b - band luminosity of stars inside the dusty cloud , we integrate the de vaucouleurs profile from the center to radius @xmath81 . to convert the b - band luminosity to bolometric luminosity of an old single stellar population ( ssp ) , we assume solar abundance for the stars , a kroupa imf and an age of @xmath100 yrs , resulting in @xmath192 ( private communication from justin harker ) . with this information we can estimate the total stellar luminosity produced within a dusty cloud of any chosen radius @xmath81 and the fraction of this energy that is observed in the _ spitzer _",
    "70@xmath1 m passband , @xmath193 .",
    "the dusty cloud can also be heated externally by stellar radiation incident on its outer surface . to estimate the flux of stellar radiation incident on the dusty cloud we first determine the mean b - band mean intensity within 10 - 100 parsecs of the galactic center , @xmath194 erg @xmath195 s@xmath14 ster@xmath14 , found by integrating over the de vaucouleurs emissivity profile corresponding to @xmath196 @xmath197 and @xmath191 kpc .",
    "the b - band flux on the surface of the cloud is then @xmath198 .",
    "the bolometric flux is larger by a factor @xmath199 so the rate that radiative energy from external galactic stars is absorbed by the dusty cloud is @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the assumed albedo .",
    "figure b1 shows how the 70@xmath1 m luminosities @xmath3(int ) and @xmath3(ext ) vary with the radius @xmath81 of the dusty cloud where we see that @xmath202 . but the important result is that clouds of size @xmath203 pc are required to produce luminosities @xmath204 erg s@xmath14 typical of those plotted in the central panel of figure 3 . in many of the elliptical galaxies in figure 3 , a @xmath5 parsec dark cloud",
    "would be easily visible even without hst resolution .",
    "we conclude that it is very unlikely that the large excess fir emission in figure 3 above that predicted by our simple model for recently produced diffuse dust , can be explained by emission from small dense clouds even under the most favorable circumstances .",
    "more importantly , the approximation of spherical clouds is seriously in error .",
    "the gas temperatures associated with these dusty clouds ( @xmath5k ? ) are much less than the virial temperature of the stars , @xmath205 k required to support a spherical cloud as we hypothesized here .",
    "the gas temperature within the dusty cloud is insufficient to provide pressure support against the stellar potential due to embedded stars or the external hot gas pressure .",
    "consequently , we expect that most of the nuclear dust clouds observed in ellipticals are highly flattened , nearly two - dimensional pancakes or disks . in this case",
    "we imagine that the @xmath3(ext ) luminosities in figure b1 are more relevant , further reducing the predicted @xmath206 m emission .",
    "we conclude that most of the fir emission observed at 70@xmath1 m and 160@xmath1 is diffusely distributed , not concentrated in dense clouds similar to those seen in absorption by many optical observers ."
