    "after the first attempt in 1964 by hahn and lindquist  @xcite to solve the problem of colliding black holes , a long  term and relatively successful program was initiated in the late 1960s by dewitt et .",
    "( see dewitt , ade , smarr , and eppley @xcite , which we henceforth collectively refer to as dcse ) .",
    "their efforts were concentrated on simulating the axisymmetric head  on collision of two equal mass black holes using the time symmetric misner data  @xcite for initial conditions .",
    "this data set possesses the `` double einstein  rosen bridge ''  @xcite topology in which two asymptotically flat sheets are joined by two throats representing non - rotating black holes .",
    "the throats are two  spheres that are invariant under an isometry operation identifying both sheets and , from a numerical standpoint , serve as a boundary across which a particular form of neumann boundary condition must be imposed on the evolved quantities to preserve the isometry .",
    "dcse developed the 2d ade @xcite coordinate system to numerically integrate and evolve the axisymmetric einstein equations .",
    "the ade coordinates are curvilinear body",
    " fitting coordinates that conform to the two black hole throats and become spherical at asymptotic infinity .",
    "the advantages of this coordinate system ( and any other appropriate body  fitting system ) include : ( 1 ) simplified boundary conditions at the black hole throats , ( 2 ) natural spherical  like grids which mimic the background schwarzschild geometry that the solutions approach at late times , ( 3 ) simplification of waveform extraction calculations in the wave zone , and ( 4 ) exponential stretching of the grid in the radial direction which covers enough of the spacetime that asymptotic flatness can be applied to the conformal metric components at the outer grid edges .",
    "however , these conveniences are offset somewhat by the singular saddle point introduced by the coordinate transformation at the origin midway between the two black holes .",
    "dcse attempted to deal with the saddle point by evolving the cylindrical ( not ade ) metric components everywhere on the ade grid and performing discretizations using chain rule derivatives .",
    "also , because black hole spacetimes can generate pathologically steep delta  function ",
    "like peaks in the metric components ( assuming singularity avoiding time slices ) , numerical evolutions can quickly become unstable even if the inherent symmetries are exploited in choosing the appropriate numerical grid and the evolved variables .",
    "additionally , it is well known  @xcite that an axis instability can be triggered in numerical evolutions of axisymmetric spacetimes . for all of these reasons , the computations of dcse remained uncertain with error bars of order 100%  @xcite .",
    "recently , anninos , hobill , seidel , smarr and suen  @xcite ( henceforth referred to as papers i , ii and iii respectively ) improved upon the dcse calculations by introducing a shift vector to diagonalize the ade metric and to evolve these components on the ade grid , thus suppressing the axis instability which is especially sensitive to the off  diagonal elements .",
    "the problem with the coordinate singularity at the origin was treated by constructing a cylindrical coordinate `` patch '' to cover regions near the saddle point .",
    "the results of anninos et al .",
    "are accurate to a few percent in the dominant wave signal for black holes which are initially placed at close to moderate separation distances . for larger initial separations ( greater than about @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the single black hole mass )",
    ", the evolutions become increasingly more inaccurate due in part to the fact that the saddle point remains within the causally connected regions of spacetime for longer periods of time as the black holes take longer to collide at the origin .",
    "if the black holes are initially separated by even greater distances ( more than about @xmath2 ) , the evolutions become unstable and break down altogether .    in short",
    ", the goal of long  term stable and accurate computations of highly separated colliding black holes has yet to be achieved .",
    "here we propose two new classes of orthogonal body ",
    "fitting coordinate systems that are well  suited to the axisymmetric geometry of two colliding black holes , and that appear promising to improve upon current calculations .",
    "the new coordinates remove the singular saddle point from its obtrusive position at the origin and thus offer a potentially cleaner and more stable method of solution . because we require spherical coordinate lines at the throats and in the far field , singular points are unavoidable .",
    "however , the saddle point singularities can be relocated along the @xmath3axis to either the south or north pole of the top hole ( and thus the north or south pole of the bottom hole , respectively ) , assuming the two holes are aligned vertically along the @xmath3axis .",
    "we refer to the former system where the singularities face the opposite black hole as the class i system : class ii refers to the latter case with the singularities facing away from the opposing throats .",
    "we are thus able to construct two new classes of coordinate systems , replacing the single singularity at the origin with a pair of saddle singularities on the throats .",
    "an advantage of transplanting the coordinate singularities to the throats prevents the black holes from `` crashing '' into a saddle point during the numerical evolutions .",
    "instead , we implement a singularity avoiding lapse function that is zero on the throat , so that the evolution along the throat freezes in time .",
    "in addition , the ( maximal ) time slicing used in the evolutions will rapidly absorb coordinate lines into the event horizon and the saddle points will fall further inside the causally disconnected portion of the evolved spacetime where the lapse collapses exponentially to zero , providing an additional stabilizing element .",
    "the following sections describe our hybrid analytic / numerical procedure to generate discrete grids for axisymmetric binary black hole systems .",
    "[ sec : radial ] introduces grid generating techniques in general and describes the particular analytic prescriptions that we developed for specifying one of the coordinates . sec .",
    "[ sec : angular ] describes the numerical calculation of the second coordinate orthogonal to the first , as well as the techniques used to compute the jacobian matrix required for the coordinate transformations , and the tests which can be used to monitor the accuracy in which the coordinate systems and jacobians are constructed .",

    "[ sec : applications ] and compared with previously published calculations .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a general and common method of constructing body ",
    "fitting coordinates is to let the curvilinear coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) satisfy the following elliptic partial differential equations  @xcite    [ eqn : laplace ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generating functions that can be used to adjust the behavior of the curvilinear coordinates in the physical domain . because the boundaries are typically irregular in cartesian coordinates ( or cylindrical coordinates in our black hole work ) , and the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) coordinates are uniform in the transformed plane , it is desirable to carry out the computations in the transformed plane , switching the dependent and independent variables . equations ( [ eqn : laplace ] ) can be inverted to yield    [ eqn : thomp ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the problem of grid generation then reduces to solving a coupled set of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations subject to the appropriate boundary conditions , which can themselves be intrinsically coupled in a complicated manner .",
    "although the elliptic solution approach is a general and straight ",
    "forward one , other methods such as conformal mapping , algebraic transformations , and hyperbolic solutions of partial differential equations have also been developed ( see @xcite for a review of grid generation techniques ) .    in this paper , we present an altogether different and much simplified procedure that does not require one to solve coupled nonlinear elliptic equations .",
    "the idea rests on the notion that the grid generation process is greatly simplified if one of the coordinates can be specified analytically . taking this coordinate",
    "as the one aligned asymptotically with either the radial or the angular direction , we show in this section how to construct a natural `` specified '' coordinate for three different classes of grids as characterized by the location of the singularity : class i",
    "( ii ) with two singular saddle points , one on each of the throats on the axis closest to ( furthest from ) the origin ; and class iii which are ade  like coordinates with a single singular point at the origin @xmath14 .",
    "we note that the function one chooses for the specified coordinate must solve the necessary boundary conditions , but is not restricted to satisfy any particular elliptic equation .    before we continue , a few notational comments are in order .",
    "four axisymmetric coordinate systems are utilized in this paper : the combination @xmath15 refers to standard cylindrical coordinates , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) denotes standard polar coordinates , ( @xmath18 , @xmath5 ) are the radial and angular  like body fitting coordinates , and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) represent the logarithmic radial and angular  like body fitting coordinates ( note the two @xmath5 coordinates are identical ) .",
    "finally we characterize the location of the two black holes by their radius @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and vertical distance from the origin along the @xmath3axis @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) represents the _ absolute _ distance of the throat center from the origin , and the upper ( lower ) black hole is denoted by the subscript 1 ( 2 ) .",

    "a singularity is generated at these points by requiring that a radial  like coordinate @xmath18 be zero on both of the throats and the entire section of the axis connecting the throats .",

    "the constant radial and angular lines lie along the field and equipotential lines of two equally charged metallic cylinders located at the centers of the two throats .",

    "in contrast with the ade coordinates , we note that the cauchy - riemann relations are not satisfied for this coordinate system .",
    "we have developed two different methods for computing the second ( unspecified ) coordinate and to establish the positions of the @xmath73 grid points in the cylindrical coordinate @xmath15 space .",
    "in addition to evaluating the grid node positions , it is also necessary to compute the jacobian matrix elements ( ie . , the coordinate derivatives ) accurately . the jacobian matrix and its inverse are needed to transform metric functions between the ( @xmath35 , @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) spaces and to perform chain rule differentiations of the cylindrical metric functions on the curvilinear grids in the coordinate `` patch '' regions described in sec .  [ sec : applications ] .",
    "we turn first to the computation of the jacobian , and then to the generation of the second coordinate .      in order to effectively use the curvilinear grids in numerical evolutions",
    ", it is important to generate the jacobian matrix and its inverse as accurately as possible , since the gravitational waves emitted from the collisions are expected to be very weak in relation to the background geometry . knowing the matrix components amounts to knowing , at each point on the grids , the coordinate derivatives @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a naive approach would be to simply evaluate these derivatives numerically at each point , after the grid has been calculated , using a second or higher order discretization stencil .",
    "instead , we adopt a more accurate procedure and take advantage of the fact that the derivatives of the specified coordinate are known analytically . in this way , only two of the elements need to be computed numerically .",

    "two components of the inverse jacobian , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are known analytically .",

    "the corresponding derivatives of the coordinate @xmath5 are known , and the expressions analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : partial_eta ] ) are derived simply by replacing @xmath4 with @xmath5 . additionally , in order to carry out the coordinate patch evolutions described in sec .  [ subsec : black ]",
    ", it is also necessary to know the second derivatives of the coordinates .",
    "these are computed in the same manner as the jacobian : the specified coordinate derivatives are evaluated analytically , and derivatives of the second coordinate are approximated numerically using fourth order stencils .",
    "we note that the orthogonality condition of the angular and radial coordinates @xmath88 can be imposed here to eliminate a third unknown derivative component from the jacobian matrix , and reduce the number of numerical discretization operations to one .",
    "however , rather than taking this approach , we defer the use of the orthogonality relationship to test the accuracy in computing the coordinate systems and the jacobian , and we have confirmed that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ortho ] ) converges to zero with the order of the integration method .",
    "one method to generate the second coordinate is to treat the lines of constant values as field lines of the known or specified coordinate .",
    "these field lines are computed by integrating along the normals to the iso  lines , e.g. along the gradient of the specified coordinate function . in other words ,",
    "given a functional form for one of the coordinates , the second orthogonal coordinate , @xmath5 in the class i case , is determined by integrating the following equations    [ eq : ortholine ] @xmath89    along lines of constant @xmath5 . here @xmath90 is an arbitrary integration parameter , and the normalization factor @xmath91 is introduced to keep the step sizes regular at points where @xmath4 has large gradients .",
    "this procedure also follows for the class ii coordinates , except that the integrated ( differentiated ) coordinate is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these lines ( the second coordinate ) are thus guaranteed to be orthogonal to the specified coordinate lines .    because the first coordinate is known exactly",
    ", we can form the spatial gradients analytically , and the problem reduces conveniently to a straight  forward ode integration . in practice ,",
    "( [ eq : ortholine ] ) are solved using a 4th order runge ",
    "kutta integration with a small fixed step size .",
    "the only difficulty with this method comes with finding the @xmath15 values at a particular @xmath73 position , since the ode integrations may overshoot the destination grid nodes .",
    "however , the step size is chosen small enough ( typically about 1% of the width of a single grid zone ) that we can interpolate linearly between the staggered points without sacrificing accuracy .",
    "once these integrations are completed , the coordinate derivatives are evaluated using the techniques described in sec .",
    "[ sec : jacobian ] .",
    "an alternate , and far more efficient , approach to constructing the numerical grids involves integrating the grid equations ( [ eqn : partial_eta ] ) , or their class ii equivalents    [ eqn : partial_theta ] @xmath92    in the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) plane .",
    "that is , rather than supplying a starting @xmath15 value , evaluating @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) and its gradients , and then tracing @xmath5 ( or @xmath4 ) along orthogonal lines in the ( @xmath35 , @xmath3 ) plane , we pre  suppose a regular ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) grid . for class",

    "we perform several different calculations of the @xmath44 and 3.0 data , varying the grid resolution , patch width , and coordinate parameters as defined in sec . [",
    "sec : classi ] to manipulate the shape of the coordinate lines . for the more problematic ade evolutions ,",
    "additional parameters include the patch length , duration and diffusion , as well as varied treatments of the coordinate singularity ( for example , shift vector specifications , discretization stencils , and regularization of certain metric and curvature components ) .",
    "the symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation ] represent the median results and the error bars indicate the variance with computational parameters .",
    "the variances are similar to the differences observed between the ade and class i results : roughly 30% and 100% in the @xmath132 and 3.0 cases respectively , with a trend for better agreement with increased resolution ( though the resolution studies are limited by the axis instability ) . for the @xmath130 cases the variances are too small to plot , but are consistent with the observed agreement in the evolutions . considering the sensitivity of the results to grid and patch parameters , and the difficulties in evolving these systems using maximal slicing conditions and in axisymmetry , the overall results agree fairly well .",
    "furthermore , the numerical calculations are in reasonable agreement with the reduced mass approximation and the semi  analytical calculation of arajo and oliveira @xcite in the large separation limit .    fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation ] also demonstrates an added advantage of the new grid generation procedure to construct numerical grids in the very low misner parameter cases . due to convergence problems in the newton ",
    "raphson iterative inversion of eqn .",
    "( [ cadezcoords ] ) when the black hole throats are placed too close to the saddle point , previous calculations were limited to @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the closest separation data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiation ] corresponds to @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 ) , although grids for even smaller values of @xmath45 can be easily generated .",
    "an additional benefit from these new coordinates is their regularity at the origin , which makes calculations of the event horizon and null generators more accurate as the black holes merge . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehembed ] we show the evolution of the embedding of the event horizon found in the @xmath136 case evolved with the class i coordinates .",
    "the embedding of the horizon is smooth ( except at the cusps on the @xmath3axis ) , as were previous embeddings of the horizon in this spacetime @xcite .",
    "however , the null surfaces on the class i grid contain not only the horizon ( in the domain @xmath137 ) , but also naturally contain the locus of generators waiting to find the horizon , as discussed in @xcite",
    ". more precisely , to generate fig .",
    "11 of @xcite a coordinate transformation from ade to @xmath15 coordinates was required .",
    "this coordinate transformation is not needed to evolve the locus in class i coordinates .",
    "this is more than a convenience , however .",
    "since the null surface consisting of the horizon plus locus is naturally represented as a smooth continuous surface in class i coordinates , the entire null surface can be unambiguously embedded in 3space , which was not possible with the ade grid .",
    "this allows us to determine the separation between the horizons in embedded space using some relevant physical measure .",
    "while in ade coordinates the horizon separation was determined to keep the outer surface of the `` pair of pants '' figure smooth , here we determine the separation by embedding the entire null surface .",
    "this gives a natural separation between the horizons from the embedding of the locus and determines the geometry by the horizon .",
    "we use this separation to place the holes in the `` wristwatch '' ( or `` pair of pants from above '' ) fig .",
    "[ fig : ehembed ] .",
    "the class i coordinates also allow for more detailed examinations of the caustic line at the coalescence point , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in many ways the axisymmetric evolution of two colliding black holes has been stalled due to the lack of a coordinate system without pathological instabilities or grid singularities . by developing new techniques to generate alternative grids , and by creating body ",
    "fitting grid geometries with singularities on the throats of the two black holes , we are able to achieve more stable long time evolutions of two black hole systems .",
    "we have demonstrated the applicability of these new grids in actual numerical evolutions of misner s initial data set for the head  on collision of two equal mass black holes .",
    "the calculations presented here confirm the existing results to fairly good accuracy in the restricted stable parameter range , with maximum relative deviations less than 3% in the radiated energies for the @xmath130 cases corresponding to initial proper separation distances of @xmath131 ( with significantly smaller deviations for the lower @xmath45 cases ) .",
    "the differences increase to about 30% for @xmath44 ( @xmath138 ) and 100% for @xmath124 ( @xmath119 ) , which are comparable to the uncertainties in the evolutions as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] for both the ade and class i systems .",
    "these differences reflect the difficulty in evolving black holes for long periods of time with maximal slicing conditions , and the sensitivity of the evolutions to treatments of the axis instability and coordinate singularities .    basically the ade and class i evolutions yield consistent results , even at the high @xmath45 values , especially when considering the changes observed in waveforms and energies by varying the computational parameters .",
    "in addition to confirming previous results , and because no specialized treatment of the coordinate singularities is required , it seems promising that we can evolve physical systems with these new coordinates which were not as easily addressable with previous codes using either the ade or cylindrical coordinate systems .",
    "for example , we are currently extending this work to evolve spinning black hole and unequal mass black hole collisions .    to conclude",
    ", we emphasize the following advantages of these new coordinates : ( 1 ) they achieve better zone coverage in the strong field interaction region near the origin  caustics , photon generators and embeddings of the event horizon are better resolved ; ( 2 ) the coordinate patch extends over a much smaller domain in the class i system  just a few zones radially , and localized to the @xmath3axis  so it is not an unstabilizing element at late times ; ( 3 ) the resulting gravitational waveforms from evolutions are not as sensitive to the patch parameters , such as its width , length , duration and diffusion parameters ; ( 4 ) due to its robustness and lack of a need for specialized treatments of the saddle points , the new code is more simplified and easily generalizable to include non - equal mass black holes and spinning black hole collisions ; and ( 5 ) the new coordinates allow a larger range of initial data in the misner parameter to be evolved , including evolutions of black holes that are further separated ( though the accuracy is questionable for @xmath139 ) , and more closely spaced ( for smaller order perturbations ) than in previous calculations .",
    "in addition , the new coordinates offer all the same advantages as the ade coordinates : they are logarithmic in the radial direction , and spherical on the throat and in the asymptotic wave zone , thus allowing for the same simplified treatment of boundary conditions and waveform extraction .",
