    "the study of charged relativistic fluid balls attract the interest of researchers of different areas of physics and astrophysics .",
    "there exists a general consensus that astrophysical objects with large amounts of charge can not exist in nature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this point of view had been challenged by several researchers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can not be discarded the possibility that during the gravitational collapse or during an accretion process onto a compact object the matter acquires large amounts of electric charge .",
    "this has been considered in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the stellar structure and temporal evolution of compact charged fluid spheres , independently on the mechanism by which the matter acquires an electric charge .    from a pure theoretical point of view , the collapse of charged fluid balls and shells are connected with the laws of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the third law of black hole thermodynamics states that no process can reduce the surface gravity of a black hole to zero in a finite advanced time @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the surface gravity , @xmath0 , plays the role of a temperature while the area of the event horizon is equivalent to the entropy .",
    "israel @xcite gave a formulation and proof of the third law .",
    "it was demonstrated that the laws of black hole thermodynamics are analogous to the common laws of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "translated to the physics of fluid collapse , the third law implies the impossibility of forming an extremal black hole , for which @xmath1 .",
    "an extremal black hole has a total charge @xmath2 : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath5 is the total mass of the black hole .",
    "the extremal black hole has not an horizon and constitutes a naked singularity , contradicting the cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "so , in this paper we explore the possibility of forming an extremal black hole from the collapse of a ( charged ) compact object . we will show that the answer is no .",
    "the relativistic equations for the collapse of a charged fluid ball were obtained by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "so far in the literature , as long as the author knows , it was studied the dynamics of charged shells or scalar fields falling onto an already formed charged black hole ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) , and solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff @xcite equations for charged stars ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc ) . however , in the stellar collapse , the collapsing matter determines the background geometry and the metric of space - time is changing with time as the star collapses .",
    "moreover , in general relativity , the pressure of the fluid contributes to the gravitational field and strengthen it . from the present study it is possible to understand if the coulomb repulsion will prevent or not the total collapse of a charged fluid ball , and which are the stability limits for a charged relativistic star .",
    "we emphasize that we will not be concerned here with the mechanism of electric charge generation , nor with effects that could neutralize or discharge the star .    in the present paper ,",
    "the equations for the evolution of charged fluid spheres in schwarzchild - like coordinates are presented in sec .",
    "[ relatequ ] . in the sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we re - derived the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and the relativistic equations for the temporal evolution of charged spheres in a form closer to that obtained by may and white @xcite , @xcite ( for the case of zero charge ) .",
    "the equations obtained are well suited for performing a finite difference scheme , and allows a direct implementation of very well known numerical techniques @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the formalism is also compatible with the bekenstein equations @xcite , and with the misner and sharp equations @xcite for the case of zero charge .",
    "the calculations performed in this study are rather lengthy in general and we tried to be the more self - consistent as possible .",
    "however , we apologize that in most of the paper we only give hints for the computation of the intermediate algebraic steps in order to keep the paper at a reasonable length .",

    "we found that although the total binding energy grows with the total amount of charge , the binding energy per nucleon tends to zero as the charge tends to the extremal value .",
    "this is related to the impossibility of obtaining bounded solutions of extremely charged fluid configurations .",

    "<S> the stars that are in the stable branch oscillates and do not collapse , while models in the unstable branch collapse directly to form black holes . stars with a charge greater or equal than the extreme value explode . </S>",
    "<S> when a charged star is suddenly discharged , it do nt necessarily collapse to form a black hole . a non - linear effect that gives rise to the formation of an external shell of matter ( see ghezzi and letelier 2005 ) , is negligible in the present simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in agreement with the third law of black hole thermodynamics and with the cosmic censorship conjecture . </S>"
