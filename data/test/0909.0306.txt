    "this is because , given the variability timescale @xmath5 , photon luminosity , and spectrum , a higher bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 decreases the photon number density as @xmath7 .",
    "the wide - band spectra ( 10 kev - gev ) of grb 080916c are well fitted by a smooth band function @xcite , and in that case the lack of evidence for an extra spectral component is consistent with a low efficiency of photomeson production due to high @xmath6 .",
    "however , from 0.5 s to 1.0 s after the trigger time ( @xmath8 ) , the short grb 090510 does exhibit a very significant ( @xmath9 ) spectral deviation to the standard band function . with the parameters of the standard band function at @xmath10 mev , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ,",
    "the excess is adequately fit with an additional power law of index @xmath13 .",
    "the power law extends from the lowest energy in _",

    ". the extra - component counts for about 37% of the total fluence and the powerlaw dominates the standard integrated - band spectrum up to a few tens of kev and above 10 mev .",
    "this additional component is the most intense from @xmath14 s to @xmath15 s. there is no clear evidence of existence of an extra component at times after @xmath15 s , however there is not enough statistical significance in the data to fully reject this hypothesis . the onset of the main emission above 100 mev is delayed about 200 ms compared to the main spike from 8 kev up to few mev .",
    "no lags have been found below 1 mev with respect to the lowest energy band 8 - 40kev over the whole light curve (  @xmath8 to @xmath16 s ) . above 1 mev , lags increase progressively to reach  248 ms and remaining constant after  40 mev .",
    "this extra component could be of leptonic origin , e.g. , external compton emission from internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or synchrotron self - compton emission from the reverse shock or forward shock in the early afterglow phase @xcite as discussed for grb 941017 @xcite .",
    "in this letter we consider an alternative possibility , namely hadronic models , in particular photomeson cascade and proton synchrotron models @xcite , for representing the extra spectral component of grb 090510 , which is present only in the prompt emission between @xmath8 and @xmath15 s. although the cascade processes initiated by @xmath17/@xmath18/@xmath19 are complicated , the resultant photon signatures of proton cascades mostly appear as synchrotron or inverse compton emission from secondary electron - positron pairs produced via @xmath20 . in such pair cascade",

    "model ] , we discuss the possibility of photon emission due to accelerated protons for grb 090510 in  [ sec : results ] , and summarize the results in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in order to constrain hadronic models for the observed extra spectral component of grb 090510 , we simulate the photon emission with photomeson - induced cascade processes from ultrarelativistic outflows of bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "the numerical code is the same as that in @xcite , which was matured via a series of grb studies @xcite , so that we omit the detailed explanation for the code . as an optimistic case , which would lead to hadronic cascades ,",
    "we assume that protons are injected with a power law energy distribution @xmath24 above 10 gev in the outflow rest frame at radii @xmath25 from the central engine .",
    "the acceleration timescale of a proton is parameterized as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the larmor radius of the proton .",
    "the maximum proton energy @xmath28 is determined by equating the acceleration timescale and the expansion timescale of the outflow @xmath29 or the cooling timescale due to proton synchrotron or photomeson production .",
    "we assume that the main low - energy component , which is fitted by a band function , is of leptonic origin @xcite , which we do not discuss further .",
    "the photon energy distribution in the outflow rest frame is estimated from the time - averaged band parameters from @xmath30 s to @xmath31 s ( @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath35 erg@xmath2s at @xmath36 ) and the numerically obtained extra component originating from protons . the energy distributions of photons and particles are simulated iteratively until they converge to a self - consistent spectrum . on a timescale",
    "comparable to @xmath37 , the photon density and the magnetic fields , etc .",
    ", can be approximately taken as constant , and we can neglect the emission from particles beyond this timescale after their injection , because the photon density and the magnetic field decline .",
    "the physical processes taken into account are 1 ) photon emission processes of synchrotron and klein - nishina regime compton scattering for electrons / positrons , protons , pions , and muons , 2 ) synchrotron self - absorption for electrons / positrons , 3 ) @xmath38 pair production , 4 ) photomeson production from protons and neutrons , 5 ) bethe - heitler pair production ( @xmath39 ) , and 6 ) decays of pions , and muons .",
    "the code can also output the spectra of neutrinos from pions and muons .",
    "there are five model parameters : the proton acceleration parameter @xmath40 , the proton injection radius @xmath25 , the bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 , the energy density of the magnetic field @xmath41 , and the injection luminosity of accelerated protons @xmath42 .",
    "the last two parameters are normalized by the photon energy density of the band component @xmath43 or @xmath44 itself as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "within the time interval between @xmath30 s and @xmath31 s , two high - energy photons of 3.4 gev and 31 gev were detected .",
    "these photons belong to the extra component of the prompt emission , whose spectrum is well fitted by a power law of @xmath13 , on which we concentrate here .",
    "( there is in addition a tail extending to @xmath47 s , attributable to an afterglow , which we do not discuss here . ) since the photon statistics above gev are not enough , we do not attempt to carry out a detailed fitting of the spectrum . alternatively , we search for parameter sets that reproduce a comparable fluence of the extra component to that of the band component .",
    "first , we consider photomeson cascades , for the most extreme case @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows two examples of photon spectra , in which the flux of the hadronic component at 3.4 gev is comparable to the band component .",
    "the model spectrum with @xmath49 seems consistent with the observed spectrum .",
    "the second peak at @xmath50 gev is mainly due to @xmath38 pair absorption .",
    "the assumed value of @xmath46 is 200 , which is quite large , so that the proton injection luminosity should be larger than @xmath51 erg@xmath2s in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt a stronger magnetic field such as @xmath52 , the required amount of protons can be suppressed to a lower value of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 erg@xmath2s ) .",
    "however , the dominance of synchrotron radiation from secondary pairs makes in this case the spectrum too soft below about 100 kev .",
    "such a large deviation from the band function around 10 kev is not seen in grb 090510 .",
    "the various timescales for the case of @xmath49 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "apparently , the maximum energy of protons @xmath28 is determined by the condition @xmath55 .",
    "the low efficiency of hadronic cascade is attributed to the much longer cooling timescale due to photopion production @xmath56 than the expansion timescale of the outflow @xmath37 even at @xmath57 .",
    "the target photons for pion production below @xmath58 ev are the band component . above this energy , protons interact with uv - photons below the observed energy range of fermi , where secondary synchrotron photons dominate . in our simulation",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption makes a spectral peak of @xmath59 plot at @xmath60 ev , which corresponds to the typical target photon energy for protons of @xmath61 ev , where @xmath56 becomes minimum . in spite of the enhancement of the pion production efficiency due to secondary photons ,",
    "we still need a large proton luminosity .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] can be shifted by changes of @xmath25 , @xmath6 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the increase of @xmath28 due to the decrease of @xmath62 with increasing magnetic fields leads to a higher efficiency of photomeson production . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , however , we need to decrease the magnetic field to values as low as @xmath49 in order to harden the spectrum , since the klein - nishina effect is crucial .",
    "let us consider protons that interact with photons of @xmath63 .",
    "the cooling timescale for such protons behaves as @xmath64 , where the photon density @xmath65 .",
    "if we adopt a smaller value of @xmath6 , the pion production efficiency would be improved as @xmath66 .",
    "however , we should note that there is a lower limit to @xmath6 , which is required to make the source optically thin to gev photons .",
    "given the photon luminosity and spectral shape , this minimum lorentz factor can be estimated as shown in the online supporting materials in @xcite . the adopted value @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] is close to the lower limit for @xmath68 cm .",
    "even if we take a larger @xmath25 , the lower limit of the lorentz factor @xmath69 does not decrease drastically ( since @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "although a smaller @xmath72 cm and a slightly larger @xmath6 can reduce the required amount of protons , the typical variability timescale @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ( @xmath68 cm and @xmath67 ) is already as small as @xmath74 ms .",
    "the poor photon statistics in grb 090510 can not constrain well the variability timescale , but the required proton energy may remain very large even for @xmath75 ms ( note that in @xcite the variability timescales are estimated as @xmath76 ms , which are adopted to obtain the minimum lorentz factor ) .",
    "an alternative hadronic scenario is a proton synchrotron model with very strong magnetic field . in this model , we need to avoid the pair cascades initiated by photomeson production , because the synchrotron spectrum from secondary pairs is too soft as discussed above .",
    "therefore , we adopt @xmath77 to suppress @xmath28 . examples for this model in fig . [ fig : f3 ] require the same order of magnitude ratios of @xmath46 as the pair cascade model . considering the typical energy of protons emitting gev photons , @xmath78 , the efficiency of proton synchrotron",
    "can be enhanced by a decrease of @xmath6 , according to @xmath79 . however , even for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , the pair cascades due to photomeson production can not be neglected in the low - energy regions . the photon spectrum below 100 kev becomes too soft again for @xmath81 owing to the pair cascade .",
    "if we can neglect the observed variability timescale @xmath82 ms , it seems that a much larger @xmath25 and slightly smaller @xmath6 could decrease the required luminosity of protons . under the conservative assumption of @xmath83",
    ", however , a decrease of @xmath84 leads to a low efficiency of proton synchrotron due to the low @xmath41 . considering the dependence of @xmath85",
    ", we can not avoid the requirement of a large proton luminosity even in the proton synchrotron scenario .    in the above",
    ", we have sought to reproduce the flux at 3.4 gev by photons originating from protons . to extend the extra component as far as 31 gev",
    ", a much larger @xmath6 is required , which would decrease the efficiency of photopion production .",
    "( for example , @xmath86 is required to obtain sufficient flux at 31 gev for @xmath48 , @xmath80 , @xmath49 , and @xmath68 cm ) .",
    "thus , we need an isotropic equivalent proton luminosity in excess of @xmath1 erg@xmath2s in order to explain the photon flux and hard spectrum of the extra component , independently of the model details .",
    "another aspect of this burst is the reported @xmath87 - 0.2 s delayed onset of the lat high - energy photons relative to the gbm trigger .",
    "this delayed onset is a common property of other _",
    "fermi_/lat grbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) . within the hadronic models ,",
    "this delay could in principle be attributed to the acceleration timescale of protons , which is limited by the shell expansion timescale .",
    "this would suggest that the timescale of the delayed onset is comparable to the variability timescale , which may be comparable to or shorter than 10 ms .",
    "however , since the cooling timescale is much longer than the shell expansion timescale in our models ( which is equivalent to the requirement @xmath88 ) , we can not deduce the delay timescale in this manner from the models considered here . in order to explain the delayed onset",
    ", we would need additional assumptions , an example of which might be spatially different origins of the band and the extra component .",
    "however , with only two photons above 1 gev , it is premature to engage here in such additional modeling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , we have also plotted the neutrino spectra ( sum over all species ) obtained from the model for @xmath49 in fig . [ fig : f1 ] ( photopion - induced pair cascade model ) and for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] ( proton synchrotron model ) . for the pair cascade case",
    ", the very large proton luminosity leads to a neutrino luminosity comparable to the photon luminosity",
    ". the neutrino number flux is estimated as @xmath89 for each energy decade from @xmath90 to @xmath91 ev .",
    "considering the effective area of the icecube detector @xcite , we may not expect neutrino detections from this burst ( the upper limit of the muon neutrino fluence for the `` naked - eye '' grb 080319b by the icecube detector is @xmath92 for @xmath93 ev ) . for the proton synchrotron model",
    ", the strong magnetic field efficiently cools pions and muons via synchrotron radiation so that the highest neutrino energies are suppressed , compared to the pair cascade model .",
    "the detection of gev photons from the short grb 090510 requires a very large lorentz factor , which leads to a low efficiency of photomeson production . adopting the observed spectrum , we have simulated the photon emission due to accelerated protons to produce the extra spectral component around gev .",
    "we have shown that this mechanism is capable of reproducing the flux in this extra component , during the approximate time interval between the trigger and @xmath94 s when this component is present . however , because of the low efficiency of photopion production , a very large proton isotropic - equivalent luminosity of @xmath95 erg@xmath2s is required to produce gev photons from electron - positron pairs . while we have assumed a power - law proton spectrum with an exponential cutoff for simplicity , the energy range , in which photopion production predominantly contributes to the secondary photon emissions , is narrow as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the required proton luminosity we suggest here practically represents the required normalization of the proton flux at this energy range ( @xmath96 ev for the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) . even if we change the proton injection spectrum , the effect on the photon spectrum would be negligible as long as the proton amount in that energy range is the same . fixing the proton amount in this energy range , of course , steeper proton spectra",
    "enhance the total injection luminosity . in principle , a lower proton luminosity associated with a stronger magnetic field could reproduce the flux around gev , provided the spectral modifications below 100 kev due to secondary pairs are weak .",
    "this remains to be investigated , but in the absence of some physical mechanism to suppress the emission of low - energy photons from secondary pairs , the spectrum predicted from such a strong field model would contradict the observations . also for the proton synchrotron model with @xmath97 discussed above , the required proton isotropic - equivalent luminosity is @xmath98 erg@xmath2s .    such `` proton - dominated '' grb models ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) are favorable for scenarios of ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray generation by grbs , but as in this case too , they require very high isotropic - equivalent proton energies @xmath98 erg / s , which are challenging for such hadronic models .",
    "however , we should note that even the photon isotropic equivalent luminosities of quite a few bursts have been found to be of that order of magnitude ( e.g. , grb 080913 , etc . ) , so that the hadronic interpretation of the extra gev component does not exceed such observed photon luminosities in other bursts .",
    "jet collimation effects can significantly alleviate such energetic problems .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of grb 090510 the afterglow is brief , and there is so far no evidence for or against any jet collimation .",
    "adopting @xmath99 as the collimation factor , the required energy may strain a conventional ns - bh merger model , but is not huge .",
    "the strain would be less on a core collapse model , but this model has not solved the short - duration issue yet .",
    "therefore , the extreme energetics of such hadronic outflow models remain a substantial challenge .    in order to distinguish models of internal shock origin including hadronic models and",
    "afterglow origin @xcite for gev photons , better photon statistics above gev are desirable .",
    "although the correlation function for this burst shows a clear correlation between gbm ( 250 kev-3mev ) and lat ( @xmath100 gev ) light curves @xcite , the typical photon number above gev in a pulse is a few .",
    "closer grbs than grb 090510 at least by a factor of 3 , from which we expect more than 10 photons in a pulse , may strengthen the correlation , but we should note that the grb rate may decrease with increasing photon statistics ( the present detection rate with fermi lat is @xmath76 grbs @xmath101 ) .",
