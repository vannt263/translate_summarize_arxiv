    "specifically , we are able to write down a closed formula for the momentum distribution of the wigner crystal mentioned in the abstract that does not involve arbitrarily chosen momentum cutoffs .",
    "thus our formalism is able to provide information about short - wavelength physics as well as the asymptotics .",
    "the subject of fermions in one - dimension is vast and we shall only provide some representative references . many of the more important references on this subject have already been included in our earlier work@xcite .",

    "this is true no matter how exactly or approximately we have solved our equations .",
    "it seems therefore that landau fermi liquids are generic .",
