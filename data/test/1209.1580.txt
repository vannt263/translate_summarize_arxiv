    "tidal theories have gained great attention in the last decade due to the large number of discovered close - in planets which orbit their parent stars with periods of a few days . according to classical theories ( e.g. darwin 1880 ; kaula 1964 ; mignard 1979 ) , the long - term tidal evolution of these planets results in orbital decay and circularization , on time - scales which depend on the physical properties of the interacting systems ( hut 1981 ; dobbs - dixon , lin & mardling 2004 ; ferraz - mello , rodrguez & hussmann 2008 ; jackson , barnes & greenberg 2009 ; rodrguez & ferraz - mello 2010 ) .    the rotation of short - period planets is also affected by tidal interactions .",
    "it is nowadays accepted that the spin rate of planets soon after their formation was much higher than their orbital mean motion ( e.g. agnor , canup & levison 1999 ; kokubo & ida 2007 ) .",
    "however , the cumulative tidal effects causes the planet to spin down , reaching its stationary value in time - scales much shorter than those needed to circularize the planet orbit .",
    "this evolution ultimately results in the synchronous rotation ( the spin state in which the orbital and rotation periods coincide ) , which occurs when the planet orbit is circularized ( hut 1981 ; ferraz - mello et al .",
    "2008 ) . for non - circular orbits ,",
    "the synchronous rotation only occurs if an additional torque acts to counteract the tidal torque .",
    "the additional gravitational torque may be generated by planets with a rocky - like composition having a permanent equatorial deformation or frozen - in figure ( see goldreich & peale 1966 ; greenberg & weidenschilling 1984 ) .",
    "these torques , in contrast to the tidal ones , are conservative . in the context of the two - body problem ,",
    "the gravitational interaction of the star with an asymmetric planet drive the planet rotation into different regimes of motion , including oscillations around exact spin - orbit resonances ( goldreich & peale 1966 ) .",
    "when dissipative tidal effects are taken into account , the oscillations are damped and the planet rotation is trapped into a resonance . indeed , the rotational motion of some solar system bodies can be explained by the combined effects of the tidal and asymmetric torques ( goldreich & peale 1966 ; greenberg & weidenschilling 1984 ; correia & laskar 2009 ) .",
    "mercury is an example of a rocky planet with a rotation state currently evolving in the 3/2 spin - orbit resonance ( pettengill & dyce 1965 ) .",
    "several models of the secular spin evolution of mercury have been developed , including i ) the chaotic evolution of its orbit ( correia & laskar 2004 ) ; ii ) effects of the core - mantle friction ( correia 2006 ; correia & laskar 2009 ) ; iii ) the evolution starting with retrograde and subsequent synchronous motion combined with impact events ( correia & laskar , 2012 ; wieczorek et al .",
    "2012 ) ; iv ) the consideration of non - linear tidal theories ( makarov 2012 ) .",
    "however , despite the large amount of previous works , the question on how the current resonant state of mercury was achieved still remains under discussion .",
    "concerning the rotation of earth - like close - in extrasolar planets , a near synchronous motion is usually assumed in view of tidal evolution .",
    "however , correia , levrard & laskar ( 2008 ) have shown that when an additional torque is considered , the equilibrium rotation of tidally evolved planets can assume rotational states which depart from synchronism . moreover , as the capture probability in a non - synchronous spin - orbit resonance requires a non - circular orbit ( goldreich & peale 1966 ; celletti & chierchia 2008 ) , the rotation of several recently discovered super - earth planets in eccentric orbits can be currently evolving under a resonant motion , provided the planet figure can support a permanent equatorial deformation .",
    "as the eccentricity is tidally damped , several resonant trappings would become unstable and the planet rotation ultimately reaches synchronization for almost circular orbits .",
    "however , the locking in a non - synchronous resonance with the very short orbital period can protect certain planet s longitudes from solar radiation , providing more favorable conditions with respect to habitability as compared to non - resonant rotation ( dobrovolskis 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , heller , leconte & barnes ( 2011 ) studied the equilibrium rotation of super - earths and the implications on their habitability .",
    "they found that , under assumption of an evolution driven by tidal torques , the equilibrium value of the rotation period of gj 581 * d * is probably about two times smaller than the orbital period .    in a recent work , callegari & rodrguez ( 2012 )",
    "have analysed the rotation of extrasolar planets with orbital periods less than 33 days and masses below the mass of neptune . depending on one parameter related to the equatorial ellipticity and also on the orbital eccentricity , they identified regions of chaotic rotation in the phase space of some particular planets like 55 cnc**e * * , gj 1214**b * * , gliese 876**d * * , among others .",
    "the present investigation aims at two main aspects : i ) how the orbital evolution of the planet , due to tidal interaction with the central star , is altered when the asymmetric torque is considered ; and ii ) to analyse the occurrence of captures in spin - orbit resonant motions under combined effects of both torques for the planets kepler-10**b * * , 55 cnc**e * * and gj 3634**b**. these planets are examples of hot super - earths , which are close - in planets having a few earth - masses with a rocky - like composition .",
    "we are interested in the past behavior in the history of the rotation and the subsequent evolution to synchronization .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of a current evolution of the rotation of these planets into a super - synchronous resonance state .",
    "moreover , we investigate the implications on the orbital evolution due to such temporary resonant trappings .    despite the continuously growing number of discovered planets ,",
    "their rotation state and equilibrium figures remain unknown . in this work",
    ", we perform several numerical simulations of the evolution of the systems , assuming several values of unknown parameters , such as equatorial ellipticity and initial rotation .",
    "the results allow us to understand the past history of these systems , their current orbital configuration and final rotational states .",
    "it should be noted that the majority of previous works concerning spin - orbit interactions with tidal dissipation have been addressed in the context of a fixed keplerian orbit , with constant values of semi - major axis and eccentricity ( e.g. , celletti , froeschl & lega 2007 ; celletti & chierchia 2008 ) .",
    "this assumption is adequate for solar system bodies , where tidal interactions are weak and , consequently , variations of orbital elements are small .    on the other hand , the existence of extrasolar planets with orbital periods of a few days indicates that their current orbital configurations would be the consequence of strong tidal interaction with the host star . in this case , the keplerian approximation is no longer valid .",
    "thus , we analyse spin - orbit interactions as the orbit evolves due to tidal effects . solving the exact equations of motion of the problem , we show that the forces arising from the potential of a asymmetric planet also contributes to the orbital variation , accelerating the orbital decay and the eccentricity damping , but only in the cases in which the rotation is locked in resonance",
    ".    the spin - orbit problem can also be modeled by the use of averaged equations of motion , where only terms with secular and resonant arguments are retained ( e.g. celletti & chierchia 2008 ; correia & laskar 2009 ) . through this model",
    ", we compute the averaged variations of semi - major axis and eccentricity due to the combination of asymmetric and tidal forces .",
    "we also give an explicit expression for the critical value of the equatorial prolateness , for which a given spin - orbit resonance would become unstable .",
    "the study of the particular cases of 2/1 , 3/2 and 1/1 spin - orbit resonances indicates a good agreement with the results of the numerical simulations of the exact equations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ model ] , we present the exact equations of motion of the spin - orbit problem . section [ num ] shows the results of the numerical simulations , illustrating the evolutions of kepler-10**b * * , gj 3634**b * * and cnc 55**e**. we show that , assuming a nonzero value of the equatorial ellipticity , different temporary resonant trappings of the rotation can occur , with implications in the orbital decay and circularization .",
    "an analytical approach in the context of the averaged equations is shown in section [ mean ] , explaining the results obtained in the numerical simulations .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "with the reference axis @xmath0 , which is assumed coincident with the orbital pericenter direction .",
    "the angle between the long axis and the star - planet direction is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the true anomaly of the planet . ]",
    "we consider a planet orbiting a central star with a period of a few days .",
    "hereafter , we refer to @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the planet and star masses , respectively ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the planet radius and the instantaneous star - planet distance , respectively .",
    "the elements @xmath7 stand for the semi - major axis , eccentricity and mean - motion of the astrocentric orbit of the planet , respectively .",
    "we suppose that the rotating planet body can be approximated by a homogeneous triaxial ellipsoid , with the equatorial axes @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the rotation axis @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath10 is normal to the orbital plane ( i.e. , no obliquity is considered ; planar problem ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the equatorial asymmetry ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to a frozen - in body or permanent deformation of the planet . the assumption above can be supported under consideration of a rocky composition of the planet body .",
    "this is the case of super - earth planets , which are the subject of the present investigation .",
    "the gravitational potential of the planet at the distance @xmath6 from its centre is given by ( e.g. beutler 2005 , p. 102 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant and the angles , which has not been included in the present paper ( see ferraz - mello et al .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath15 are defined in figure [ elips ] .",
    "note that @xmath16 is the angular rotation velocity of the planet .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 describes the equatorial ellipticity of the planet s gravity field and is related to the principal momenta of inertia @xmath18 through @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the structure constant given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the polar moment of inertia .",
    "we neglect the contribution of terms arising from the oblateness of the rotating body , that is , @xmath23 and higher order terms .",
    "in fact , in the planar problem , the gravitational potential corresponding to the @xmath23term depends only on the distance @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", the potential generates a radial force with zero torque that does not affect the rotation evolution .    at the distance @xmath6 from the centre of the planet",
    ", the gravitational field @xmath24 gives rise to a force on a point mass @xmath4 which is given by adopted in beutler ( 2005 ) , the corresponding force is computed as the positive gradient of the potential . ]",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are unit vectors with origin in the star ( see fig .",
    "[ elips ] ) . the force @xmath28 alters the orbital component of the angular momentum , whereas the reaction force governs the evolution of the spin through the creation of the torque on the planet given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 note that , for @xmath33 and @xmath19 , the above equation agrees with the classical expression for the torque ( e.g. danby 1962 ; goldreich & peale 1966 ) .",
    "the effects of the dynamical tides are raised by the gravitational action of the star on the inelastically deformed rotating planet . due to the internal viscosity of the body",
    ", there exists a delay @xmath34 ( time lag ) between the star perturbation and the maximum deformation .",
    "the relationship between @xmath34 and tidal frequencies ( which are linear combinations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) depends on the internal rheology , which is poorly known even for solar system bodies . for sake of simplicity , in this work , we adopt a linear model with constant @xmath34 ( darwin 1879 ; mignard 1979 ; hut 1981 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "2011a ) ; for a review of other tidal models , the reader is referred to efroimsky & williams ( 2009 ) and ferraz - mello ( 2012 ) .    according to mignard ( 1979 ) , the tidal force and torque are given by @xmath37,\\ ] ] and @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the second degree love number . in this paper , we only consider the tides raised by the star on the planet , neglecting the tides raised on the star by the planet . indeed ,",
    "the strength of stellar tide is proportional to the planet mass and can be safely neglected in the case of super - earths ( see rodrguez & ferraz - mello 2010 ) .",
    "note however that , after circularization of the planet orbit , stellar tides may be the only source of orbital decay .    in the reference frame centered in the star ( see figure [ elips ] ) , the exact equations of motion of the planet can be now written as @xmath41 the perturbing forces @xmath28 and @xmath42 alter the keplerian orbit of the planet which is defined by the first term of the first equation , while the corresponding torques in the second equation produce variations of the planet rotation .",
    "note that , in the planar case , this last equation can be written in scalar form , because both torques are normal to the orbital plane .",
    "in this section we apply the analytical model described in the previous section , in order to investigate the motion of three known super - earths planets , namely kepler-10**b * * , 55 cnc**e * * and gj 3634**b**. for this task , the exact equations of motion ( [ mov1 ] ) were integrated numerically using the ra15 code ( everhart 1985 ) .",
    "we stress that no scaling parameter , often used to accelerate the tidal evolution , was used in our simulations ( see , for instance , tittemore & wisdom ( 1988 ) , for the validity of the usage of the scaling parameter ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      numerical integrations require a setting of the initial configurations of the systems . in the case of problems including dissipative processes , the choice is complicated , mainly , due to the inadequacy of the simulations of the past evolution of dissipative systems through integrations backward in time ( see details in michtchenko & rodrguez 2011 ) . however , as shown in that paper , the final state of a migrating system is independent of its initial position in the phase space , defined by three values of parameters : the mass and semi - major axes ratios and the total angular momentum . as a consequence , to assess the orbit configuration in the past , we have to set solely the starting semi - major axis value .",
    "the initial eccentricity should satisfy the conservation of the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "the total angular momentum of the system is composed of the orbital component written as @xmath48 , and the rotational component given by @xmath49 .",
    "using kepler s third law , it is easy to show that the ratio of rotational and orbital components is of the order of @xmath50 ( see rodrguez et al .",

    "moreover , for the same value of @xmath17 , the rate of orbital decay and circularization seems to depend on the specific sor in which the planet rotation is trapped in . for example , in the case of @xmath73 , the evolutions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 show two different regimes as the rotation evolves first in the 2/1 and then in 3/2 trappings ( see section [ mean ] ) .",

    "the latter would depend on the orbital eccentricity , the planet s @xmath17 value and its dissipation factor .",

    "we have shown that under assumption of @xmath96 , the evolution along spin - orbit resonance ( sor ) leads to higher rates of orbital decay and circularization than the corresponding ones when the rotation evolves in the sts . moreover , for a given @xmath17 value , the variation rates of the elements depend on the specific trapping in which the rotation is trapped in , and increases with @xmath142 ( see figure [ ae - zoom - k10 ] ) .",
    "we have also calculated the averaged rates of variations of semi - major axis and eccentricity including the gravitational and tidal torques . moreover , through the analytical calculation of the critical value of @xmath17 it is possible to predict the values of the eccentricity for which a given sor would become unstable .",
    "the comparison with the direct numerical simulations have shown a good concordance for the analysed planets .",
    "the importance of the @xmath17 value on the rotational history of the planet is illustrated in the example of kepler-10**b**. it is worth noting that the planet rotation of kepler-10**b * * can evolve under the influence of the 2/1 sor for longer time - scales ( i.e. , small @xmath54 ) provided the planet figure can support a permanent equatorial deformation characterized by @xmath216 . for smaller @xmath17 ,",
    "the 2/1 resonant state would become unstable for relatively large eccentricity ( figures [ c22 ] and [ rot - exce - k10 ] ) .",
    "we stress that the results of the numerical simulations provide different possible spin - orbit evolutions depending on the considered initial values of elements and rotation . the @xmath56 value and the specific tidal model would also play an important role in determining the rotation history of the planet , since the temporary trapping in sor depends on the rate of eccentricity damping , which is @xmath56-dependent .",
