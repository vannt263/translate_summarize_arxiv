    "over the last half - a - dozen years , it has been increasingly realized that the detection of non - gaussianities in the primordial perturbations can considerably help in constraining the inflationary models ( see refs .",

    "@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the detection of a high value for the dimensionless non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 that is often used to describe the amplitude of the scalar bi - spectrum can rule out a wide class of models . for instance , if the extent of non - gaussianity actually proves to be as large as the mean values of @xmath0 arrived at from the wmap data ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ; in this context , also see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , then canonical scalar field models that lead to slow roll inflation and nearly scale invariant primordial spectra will cease to be consistent with the data",
    ".    however , the evaluation of the scalar bi - spectrum in a generic inflationary model proves to be a non - trivial task  @xcite .",
    "often , it is the slow roll approximation that is resorted to in order to arrive at analytical expressions for the scalar bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter  @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "while the slow roll approximation can actually encompass a relatively wide class of models , evidently , the approach will cease to be valid when departures from slow roll occur . in such situations , one",
    "is often forced to approach the problem numerically . in this work",
    ", we shall present a new and accurate fortran code , the bi - spectra and non - gaussianity operator ( bingo ) , to numerically evaluate the scalar bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter  @xmath0 for single field inflationary models involving the canonical scalar field .",
    "although , some partial numerical results have already been published in the literature , we believe that it is for the first time that a general and efficient code has been put together to evaluate the complete scalar bi - spectrum .",
    "though , we shall largely restrict our discussion in this paper to the equilateral case , as we shall illustrate , the code can compute the scalar bi - spectrum and the parameter  @xmath0 for any triangular configuration of the wavevectors .",
    "also , as we shall demonstrate , bingo can also compute _ all _ the different contributions to the bi - spectrum .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that , under certain conditions , the code can arrive at the results within a matter of a few minutes .",
    "we should mention here that we have made a limited version of bingo , viz .",
    "one that focuses on the equilateral limit , available online at https://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram/bingo/bingo.html .    as an immediate application",
    ", we shall utilize the code to examine of the power of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 to discriminate between different inflationary models that admit deviations from slow roll and generate similar features in the scalar power spectrum .",
    "recall that , most single field inflationary models naturally lead to an extended period of slow roll and hence to nearly scale invariant primordial power spectra ( see , for example , any of the following texts  @xcite or reviews  @xcite ) , which seem to be fairly consistent with the recent data on the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( in this context , see refs .",
    "@xcite ; for a comparison of a class of inflationary models with the data , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) as well as other observational constraints .",
    "however , it has been repeatedly noticed that certain features in the inflationary scalar power spectrum can improve the fit to the cmb data at the cost of some additional parameters ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "though the statistical significance of these features remain to be understood satisfactorily  @xcite , they gain importance from the phenomenological perspective of comparing the models with the data , because only a smaller class of single field inflationary models , which allow for departures from slow roll , can generate them .",
    "interestingly , demanding the presence of features in the scalar power spectrum seems to generically lead to larger non - gaussianities ( see , for example , refs .",
    "therefore , features may offer the only route ( unless one works with non - vacuum initial states  @xcite ) for the canonical scalar fields to remain viable if @xmath0 turns out to be significant .",
    "if indeed the presence of features turns out to be the correct reason behind possibly large non - gaussianities , can we observationally identify the correct underlying inflationary scenario , in particular , given the fact that different models can lead to similar features in the scalar power spectrum ?",
    "in other words , to what extent can the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 help us discriminate between the inflationary models that permit features ?",
    "to address this question , we shall consider a few typical inflationary models leading to features , assuming that they can be viewed as representatives of such a class of scenarios . concretely",
    ", we shall consider the starobinsky model  @xcite and the punctuated inflationary scenario  @xcite , both of which result in a sharp drop in power at large scales that is followed by oscillations .",
    "we shall also study large and small field models with an additional step introduced in the inflaton potential  @xcite .",
    "the step leads to a burst of oscillations in the scalar power spectrum which improve the fit to the outliers near the multipole moments of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the cmb anisotropies .",
    "we shall also consider oscillating inflaton potentials such as the one that arises in the axion monodromy model which lead to modulations in the power spectrum over a wide range of scales  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the following section",

    "we shall also contrast the numerical results with the analytical results obtained under the slow roll approximation in the case of the popular quadratic potential for an arbitrary triangular configuration of the wavevectors .",

    "in fact , we had recently shown that , for cosmological modes that are on super - hubble scales during preheating , the contributions to the bi - spectrum and , equivalently , to the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 , prove to be negligible  @xcite .",

    "therefore , we shall rapidly sketch the essentials arguments below , referring the readers to our recent work for further details  @xcite .      during inflation ,",

    "it is now a matter of making use of the above solutions for @xmath13 and @xmath49 to determine the super - hubble contributions to the bi - spectrum during inflation .      to begin with ,",
    "note that , each of the integrals @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , can be divided into two parts as follows : @xmath60 the integrals in the first term @xmath61 run from the earliest time ( i.e. @xmath46 ) when the smallest of the three wavenumbers @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is sufficiently inside the hubble radius [ typically corresponding to @xmath65 to the time ( say , @xmath66 ) when the largest of the three wavenumbers is well outside the hubble radius [ say , when @xmath67 .",

    "let us first focus on the fourth term @xmath70 since it has often been found to lead to the largest contribution to the bi - spectrum when deviations from slow roll occur  @xcite .",
    "as the slow roll parameters turn large towards the end of inflation , we can expect this term to contribute significantly at late times .",

    "but , the remaining contribution can not be ignored and needs to be taken into account .",
    "it is useful to note that this term is essentially the same as the one due to the field redefinition , but which is now evaluated on super - hubble scales ( i.e. at @xmath66 ) rather than at the end of inflation . in other words , if we consider the fourth and the seventh terms together , it is equivalent to evaluating the contribution to the bi - spectrum corresponding to @xmath75 , and adding to it the contribution due to the seventh term @xmath47 evaluated at @xmath66 rather than at the end of inflation .",
    "let us now turn to the contribution due to the second term , which can occasionally prove to be comparable to the contribution due to the fourth term  @xcite . upon making use of the behavior of the mode @xmath13 and its derivative on super - hubble scales in the integral  ( [ eq : cg2 ] )",

    "[ fig : sm - all ] , we shall choose the following values of the parameters : @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 , while , in the case of the latter , we shall work with the same values of @xmath228 and @xmath218 , but shall set @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . also , we shall work with an initial value of @xmath231 in the first instance and with @xmath232 in the second .",
    "further , we shall start with field velocities that are determined by the slow roll conditions in both the cases .",
    "we shall now discuss the scalar power spectra generated by the different inflationary models that we have listed above .",
    "we shall highlight here certain aspects of the power spectra that arise in the different class of models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sps - all ] , we have illustrated the scalar power spectrum that arises in the different models that we consider . as we had discussed in sub - sec .",
    "[ subsec : dnm ] , the standard bunch - davies initial conditions are imposed on the perturbations when the modes are well inside the hubble radius .",
    "the modes are evolved on to super hubble scales , and the spectrum is evaluated when the amplitude of the curvature perturbation has frozen when they are sufficiently outside the hubble radius .    [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath233 [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath163    let us first focus on the power spectra that arise in the starobinsky model  @xcite and the punctuated inflationary scenario  @xcite .",
    "note that , both these models lead to a step like feature as well as a spike in the power spectrum .",
    "the spikes arise due to the sharp departure from slow roll that occurs in these models .",
    "while the first slow roll parameter @xmath50 remains small in the starobinsky model as the field crosses the transition , the second slow parameter @xmath44 turns very large briefly  @xcite . in the case of punctuated inflation",
    ", @xmath50 itself grows to a large value thereby actually interrupting inflation for about a e - fold .",
    "it is this property that results in a sharper spike in the power spectrum in the case of punctuated inflation than the starobinsky model .",
    "the overall step in these models is easier to understand , and it simply arises due to the difference in the hubble scales associated with the slow roll epochs before and after the period of fast roll .",
    "both these models also lead to oscillations before the spectra turn nearly scale invariant on small scales .",
    "the spectra that arises in punctuated inflation , in addition to leading to a better fit to the outliers at very small multipoles ( because of the drop in power on these scales ) , also provides an improvement in the fit to the outlier at @xmath234  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the cases of the models with a step in the potential and the potentials which contain oscillatory terms .",
    "in contrast to the starobinsky model and the punctuated inflationary scenario , these models lead to much milder deviations from slow roll . as a result",
    ", they also lead to smaller deviations from a nearly scale invariant power spectrum . in the context of models with a step in the potential",
    ", a step at the correct location and of a suitable amplitude leads to a burst of oscillations in the power spectrum which in turn provides an improved fit to the outliers at @xmath234 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note in fig .",
    "[ fig : sps - all ] that the spectra from punctuated inflation and the model with a step in the potential match briefly as they oscillate near scales corresponding to @xmath234 . clearly , it is this behavior that leads to a better fit to the outlier in the data at these scales .",
    "while all the models that we have discussed on until now result in localized features , the models with oscillating inflation potentials are somewhat special as they contain non - local features , i.e. they lead to continuing oscillations that extend over a wide range of scales in the power spectrum .",
    "needless to add , they arise due to the persisting oscillations of the scalar field as it rolls up and down the modulations in the potential .",
    "interestingly , these features provide an improved fit to the data over a large range of all scales  @xcite .",
    "we shall now discuss the bi - spectra and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 arrived at numerically in the various models of our interest .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - all.ps ] , we have plotted the various contributions , viz .",
    "@xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( in the equilateral limit ) for the punctuated inflationary scenario driven by the potential  ( [ eq : mssm - p ] ) , the quadratic potential  ( [ eq : qp ] ) with the step  ( [ eq : step ] ) , and the axion monodromy model  ( [ eq : amm ] ) which contains oscillations in the inflaton potential .    [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath138 [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath163 -15pt -15pt    these plots ( and also the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm - all ] ) clearly point to the fact that it is the combination @xmath128 that contributes the most to the scalar bi - spectrum in these cases  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl - all ] , we have plotted the quantity @xmath39 due to the dominant contribution that arises in the various models that we have considered .",
    "[ 0][1][1.0]@xmath39 [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath235 [ 0][1][1.0]@xmath163    -12pt    it is clear from this figure that , while in certain cases @xmath89 can prove to be a good discriminator , it can not help in others , and its ability to discriminate depends strongly on the differences in the background dynamics .",
    "for instance , the evolution of the first two slow roll parameters are very similar when a step is introduced in either the quadratic potential or a small field model  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that the @xmath39 behaves in a similar fashion in both these models .",
    "whereas , @xmath39 proves to be substantially different in punctuated inflation and the starobinsky model .",
    "recall that , in the starobinsky model , the first slow roll parameter remains small throughout the evolution .",
    "in contrast , it grows above unity for a very short period ( leading to a brief interruption of the accelerated expansion ) in the punctuated inflationary scenario .",
    "it is this departure from inflation that leads to a sharp drop in the power spectrum and a correspondingly sharp rise in the parameter @xmath39 in punctuated inflation .",
    "in fact , this occurs for modes that leave the hubble radius just before inflation is interrupted  @xcite .",
    "however , note that , @xmath39 grows with @xmath163 at large wavenumbers in the starobinsky model .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that @xmath51 , which determines the contribution due to the fourth term , diverges due to the discontinuity in the second derivative of the potential  @xcite .",
    "but , we should hasten to clarify that this can be shown to be an unphysical artifact arising due to the presence of a heaviside function in the description of the potential .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath39 is rather large in the axion monodromy model in contrast to the case wherein the conventional quadratic potential is modulated by an oscillatory term . the large value of @xmath89 that arises in the monodromy model can be attributed to the resonant behavior encountered in the model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have also evaluated the @xmath39 for the case of quadratic potential modulated by sinusoidal oscillations , which too leads to continuing , periodic features in the scalar power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the @xmath39 in such a case proves to be rather small ( of the order @xmath236 or so ) .",
    "in this work , we have presented bingo , a code for the efficient computation of the bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 in single field inflationary models involving the canonical scalar field . while there has been previous efforts in the literature towards numerically calculating the bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 , our effort in arriving at bingo",
    "can be said to be more complete for the following four reasons .",
    "first and foremost , we have explicitly illustrated that the procedures that bingo adopts to evaluate the integrals involved are robust .",
    "on the one hand , we have converged on a suitable form for the cut off required in the sub - hubble domain ( in particular , the value of the cut off parameter @xmath120 ) and the corresponding lower limit of the integrals , after a careful investigation of their effects on the amplitude of the bi - spectrum . on the other , we have shown that the super - hubble contributions to the complete bi - spectrum are negligible , which allows us to arrive at a convenient upper limit for the integrals . secondly , bingo can calculate all the contributions to the bi - spectrum .",
    "thirdly , it can evaluate the bi - spectrum for an arbitrary triangular configuation of the wavevectors .",
    "lastly , we have compared the numerical results from bingo with the analytical expressions available in certain specific cases , an exercise which illustrates that bingo can be accurate to better than @xmath173 . as we had mentioned in the introductory section ,",
    "we have made a version of bingo , one that focuses on the equilateral limit , available online at https://www.physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram/bingo/bingo.html . moreover ,",
    "if needed , as we have pointed out earlier , the level of accuracy of bingo can be improved by carrying out the integrals from a larger initial value of @xmath144 ( i.e. from an earlier point in time ) and simultaneously working with a smaller value of the cut off parameter  @xmath120 .",
    "in fact , in the code that is publicly available , these parameters have been allowed to be set by the user , as is desired .    after presenting bingo and illustrating the extent of its accuracy",
    ", we had made use of the code to examine the power of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 to lift degeneracies between various single field inflationary models involving the canonical scalar field at the level of the power spectrum . with this goal in mind ,",
    "using bingo , we have evaluated the quantity @xmath39 in a slew of models that generate features in the scalar perturbation spectrum .",
    "we find that the amplitude of @xmath39 proves to be rather different when the dynamics of the background turns out reasonably different , which , in retrospect , need not be surprising at all . for instance , models such as the punctuated inflationary scenario and the starobinsky model which lead to very sharp features in the power spectrum also lead to substantially large @xmath0 .",
    "such possibilities can aid us discriminate between the models to some extent .",
    "we had focused on evaluating the quantity @xmath0 in the equilateral limit .",
    "it will be worthwhile to compute the corresponding values in the other limits as well as for the other forms ( such as the squeezed and the orthogonal ones ) of the non - gaussianity parameter  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to examine if the so - called consistency relation between the local non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 and the scalar spectral index in the squeezed limit is valid even in situations wherein extreme deviations from slow roll occur ( in this context , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . actually , since many of the models leading to features have interesting bi - spectral shapes , it is important that we arrive at the spectral shapes for the various models for an arbitrary triangular configurations of the wavenumbers .",
    "it is also important that , apart from computing the local non - gaussianity parameter as we have done here , one evaluates the corresponding equilateral and the orthogonal parameters as well .",
    "we are currently working on extending the scope of bingo to these cases .",
    "we would like to conclude by highlighting one important point .",
    "having computed the primordial bi - spectrum , the next logical step would be to compute the corresponding cmb bi - spectrum , an issue which we have not touched upon as it is beyond the scope of the current work . while tools seem to be available to evaluate the cmb bi - spectrum based on the first order brightness function , the contribution due to the brightness function at the second order remains to be understood satisfactorily ( in this context , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the last reference in ref .",
    "this seems to be an important aspect that is worth investigating closer .",

    "<S> we present a new and accurate fortran code , the bi - spectra and non - gaussianity operator ( bingo ) , for the efficient numerical computation of the scalar bi - spectrum and the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 in single field inflationary models involving the canonical scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the code can calculate all the different contributions to the bi - spectrum and the parameter @xmath0 for an arbitrary triangular configuration of the wavevectors . focusing firstly on the equilateral limit </S>",
    "<S> , we illustrate the accuracy of bingo by comparing the results from the code with the spectral dependence of the bi - spectrum expected in power law inflation . </S>",
    "<S> then , considering an arbitrary triangular configuration , we contrast the numerical results with the analytical expression available in the slow roll limit , for , say , the case of the conventional quadratic potential . considering a non - trivial scenario involving deviations from slow roll </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the results from the code with the analytical results that have recently been obtained in the case of the starobinsky model in the equilateral limit . as an immediate application </S>",
    "<S> , we utilize bingo to examine of the power of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 to discriminate between various inflationary models that admit departures from slow roll and lead to similar features in the scalar power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we close with a summary and discussion on the implications of the results we obtain . </S>"
