    "the addition of a three - nucleon interaction with only two to four parameters produces quantitative agreement with experiment for the nuclear binding energies and spin - orbit splittings , including the correct ground state ( @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 ) for @xmath6b @xcite .    for nuclei with @xmath7 ,",
    "methods using correlated hyperspherical harmonic bases or faddeev and similar formulations have solved bound - state , scattering , and reaction problems quite successfully @xcite .",
    "the _ ab initio _ methods that have been developed for @xmath8 nuclei are suited mainly to treatment of bound states , but there has been significant progress on unbound states in recent years .",
    "the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method has been formulated as a particle - in - a - box method and used to compute phase shifts in the @xmath9he system with a full realistic hamiltonian @xcite . the no - core shell model ( ncsm )",
    "has been merged with the resonating group method ( rgm ) to produce phase shifts and reaction cross sections in several systems using effective two - body forces without explicit three - body terms @xcite .",
    "the coupled - cluster method has been combined with a gamow shell model basis to compute complex energies @xmath10 of resonances and thus their excitation energies @xmath11 and total widths @xmath12 .",
    "it has been applied to resonances of he isotopes and @xmath13 nuclei , but it has not been used to produce cross sections @xcite .",
    "all of these approaches to scattering are computationally challenging , and significant human and computer effort is required for each individual system .    even before the development of true scattering / reaction calculations in @xmath8 nuclei , there were accurate energy calculations for many unbound resonance states @xcite , produced by approximating them with bound ( i.e. , square - integrable ) wave functions and real energies .",
    "this approach is successful for states sufficiently narrow that important features of their structure can be accommodated within the model space .",
    "one way to understand these calculations is as approximations to gamow s decaying complex - energy states @xcite with energies near the real axis ( i.e. , small widths ) .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations of square - integrable `` pseudobound '' states begin with a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation , in which a complicated but closed - form wave function containing large amounts of correlation is produced by minimizing the energy expectation value with respect to many variational parameters @xcite .",
    "the computational effort in the vmc method lies in computing energy expectation values by monte carlo integration over all particle coordinates , and a square - integrable wave function is necessary for both energy and normalization integrals to converge .",
    "the variational ansatz incorporates square integrability through particle correlations that decay exponentially at large separation , and reasonable energies result because the long - range tails of the true resonant wave function have small amplitudes relative to the `` interaction region '' where all nucleons interact .",
    "the second step in application of the qmc method to nuclei is a gfmc calculation .",
    "this step also requires square - integrable wave functions for evaluation of matrix elements .",
    "gfmc takes the vmc wave function as a starting point and evolves the schrdinger equation for imaginary values of the time @xmath14 through a series of small steps .",
    "this evolution filters high - energy contamination out of the wave function and for large @xmath15 leaves behind the lowest - energy eigenstate contained in the vmc starting point . for bound or narrow states",
    ", this procedure `` converges '' at large @xmath15 to a unique energy @xcite . for broad states",
    "the gfmc propagation drifts slowly toward the lowest available threshold ; even in very long gfmc propagations , the curve of energy _ versus _",
    "@xmath15 for such states fails to flatten out at a `` converged '' energy .",
    "presumably this also occurs for the narrow states , but with a decline too slow to have been noticed in calculations so far .",
    "because the calculated energies of narrow resonances in the qmc methods are believed to be accurate , it is natural to ask whether widths could be extracted from these calculations , avoiding the considerable effort of explicit scattering / reaction calculations .",
    "attempts to correlate the width with the rate of decline of the energy , @xmath16 , in the late - time gfmc propagation failed , so the rate may depend more on the starting wave function than on the physical width  @xcite .    even in explicit scattering calculations ,",
    "some widths are effectively too narrow to resolve by qmc methods .",
    "direct qmc calculations of widths so far consist of energy calculations for a series of specified boundary conditions @xcite , so the smallest width that can be computed must be larger than the energy resolution of the method . as an extreme example",
    ", the ground state of @xmath2b has a total energy of @xmath17 mev and a width of 0.5 kev , roughly 0.01% of the total . since the typical precision claimed for gfmc energy calculations is 1%",
    ", this width will not be amenable to calculation in this way .    here",
    "i present a method to extract approximate widths from qmc wave functions .",
    "the basis of this approach is a relation between the partial width in a specified breakup channel and an integral over the `` interaction region '' where all of the nucleons are close to each other .",
    "this relation has been used in the literature , though not ( to my knowledge ) in explicit application to many - body wave functions .",
    "it has been used particularly in models of alpha @xcite and proton @xcite decays of heavy nuclei in order to avoid direct integration of the schrdinger equation to impractically large radii .",
    "it is also closely related to green s function formulations of scattering theory .",
    "there has been considerable interest in applying such formulations to _ ab initio _ calculations in the recent literature : they have been used to extract asymptotic normalization coefficients ( ancs ) from many - body bound states computed in various approximations @xcite and are coming into wider use for scattering problems @xcite .",
    "preparation for future reaction calculations of that kind is a primary motivation of the present work .",
    "although the integral relation can be used to compute the partial width in any two - body decay channel if wave functions of the parent and daughter nuclei are known , i confine my consideration in the present study to nucleon emission .",
    "i compute widths for all narrow ( @xmath18 mev ) one - nucleon decays to bound states in @xmath19 nuclei .",
    "i also present results for several specific broad states for which better theoretical information concerning widths would be useful and for some with unbound final states that are well - represented by pseudobound wave functions .",
    "the integral relation applied here can be used with either gfmc or vmc wave functions , extending even to use of the same computer routines .",
    "application to gfmc requires more computation and additional bookkeeping , so i have chosen in this initial study to use only vmc wave functions .",
    "this work represents the extension to unbound states of the methods presented in ref .",
    "the integral relation used here may be used with other many - body methods , but it is particularly well - suited to qmc wave functions because of its formulation as a short - range integral and because of the transparent treatment of fermion antisymmetry in the qmc methods .",
