    "one of the major changes in our understanding of our universe has been the realization of the rich and complex structures which are apparent in the large scale distribution of galaxies . from both redshift surveys and",
    "projected galaxy distributions , the appearance of galaxy voids and supercluster filaments has become clear .",
    "the large scale structure also is an important constraint for different cosmological scenarios . on smaller scales ,",
    "investigations of the relationships between nearby galaxy clusters suggest that clusters retain information about the large scale structures from which they form ( e.g. , van haarlem & van de weygaert 1993 ; west et al . 1995 , west 1997 ; colberg et al .",

    ", we have studied the large scale mass distribution around the richness class  1 cluster abcg 85 ( abell et al .",
    "1989 ) , using x - ray and optical observations . as a bright , luminous , relatively nearby cluster , abcg 85 has been studied extensively . at a redshift of @xmath2 ,",
    "the angular scale for abcg 85 corresponds to @xmath3  kpc arcmin@xmath4 ( we assume h@xmath5= 50 km sec@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 throughout ) .",
    "abcg 85 contains a cd galaxy close to its center .",
    "the cluster x - ray characteristics include a peaked emission profile , harboring a cooling flow , emission from individual cluster member galaxies , an x - ray emitting subcluster south of the cluster center ( hereafter the south blob ) , a superposed foreground group of galaxies ( to the west - northwest ) , as well as additional foreground and background structures detected from the optical spectroscopic observations ( see jones et al . 1979 , pislar et al .",

    ", we report on the x - ray and optical properties of a larger region around abcg 85 than has been considered in previous studies , and in particular include the nearby clusters abcg 87 and abcg 89 .",
    "we find that abcg 85 itself exhibits preferential alignments on scales from 100 kpc to @xmath6mpc ( in projection on the sky ) .",
    "in particular , the cluster cd galaxy is elongated along the same position angle as a large filamentary structure in x - rays roughly coinciding with the optical position of abcg 87 . located to the east of abcg 85",
    "is abcg 89 , not detected as an extended x - ray source .",
    "we also address why abcg 87 appears different in the optical and x - ray and why abcg 89 appears as a cluster in the optical observations and not in x - rays .",
    "based on these results , we discuss the abcg 85/87/89 complex and describe the alignments and/or structures in the context of a large scale structure formation scenario such as that proposed by west et al .",

    "we have analyzed the rosat pspc observations of abcg 85 using an image in the energy band 0.5 - 2.0 kev binned into 15 arcsecond pixels and flat fielded .",
    "figure [ xcont ] shows the resulting rosat pspc image of the @xmath7 radius field centered on abcg 85 , smoothed with a @xmath8 gaussian to enhance the signal to noise ratio at large off - angle distances .",
    "the image clearly shows emission peaked on the cd at the cluster center , a second region of extended emission ( the south blob ) approximately @xmath9 south of abcg 85 ( 720 kpc , projected on the sky ) , as well as point sources scattered over the pspc field of view ( fov ) .",
    "in addition to these features , there is an excess of emission towards the south south - east , extending almost to the edge of the fov .",
    "the emission to the southeast is concentrated in a narrow range of position angles , approximately between 135@xmath10 and 180@xmath10 ( counter clockwise from north ) ; the positions and net counts of individual sources from this region are listed in table  1 .",
    "we also generated an image following the snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ; see also snowden 1995 ) prescription which slightly reduces the field of view but shows the same features in the overlapping regions .",
    ".x - ray source properties [ cols= \" > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ carottes ]      we defined seven subsamples of galaxies chosen in circular regions on the sky ( see table  [ carottes ] and fig .",
    "[ echantillon ] ) .",
    "one is located at the center of the cluster abcg 85 ( named sc ) and two ( named a89 and a87 ) are located at the positions of abcg 89 and abcg 87 as indicated by the ned database .",
    "two control subsamples are chosen at the symmetrical positions of a 87 and a 89 relative to the abcg 85 center : c87 is symmetric to a87 , and c89 to a89 .",
    "to these five samples , we add two comparison samples : c1 between a87 and c89 and c2 symmetric to c1 relative to the abcg 85 center ( see fig .",
    "[ echantillon ] ) .",
    "the radii of all these circles have been chosen in each case to avoid superposition of possible structures , while obtaining a significant number of velocities in each sample .",

    "the peak observed between 20000  and @xmath1126000 ( fig .",
    "[ grandechelle ] ) is particularly strong in the region of a89 ( figs .  [ grandechelle ] and [ vits1 ] ) ; this peak ( hereafter abcg 89b ) has a velocity dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "such a value is too large for a single relaxed group , thus suggesting either substructure or contamination by other structures . as fig .",
    "[ grandechelle ] shows , the maximum between 20000 and 26000  is not at the same velocity for all the samples . in particular",
    ", the peaks for the control samples c87 and c89 are higher : @xmath024000 for c87 and @xmath025000  for c89 .",
    "the clustering of velocities , together with the variation of the peak velocity , suggest the presence of a sheet of galaxies inclined with respect to the plane of sky .",
    "this sheet is not visible in the two control samples c1 and c2 .",
    "a second peak is observed in the a89 velocity distribution at about 28500  ( see figs .",
    "[ grandechelle ] and [ vits1 ] ) .",
    "an enhancement is also found at this velocity in the c1 control sample ( fig .",
    "[ temoin ] ) , but no peak is present in the five other velocity samples in fig .",
    "[ grandechelle ] .",
    "this high redshift component of a89 has a velocity dispersion of @xmath14=@xmath15 , typical of a galaxy group or small cluster .",

    "the velocity distributions in this range are displayed in figs .",
    "[ vits1 ] , [ vitsc ] , [ vits2 ] , [ vits4 ] and [ vits3 ] for the a89 , sc , a87 , c87 and c89 samples respectively .",
    "we have analysed the distribution at various scales . however , due to the inhomogeneous number of galaxy velocities in the various samples distributed in various velocity intervals , the scales differ , depending on the number of galaxies in each sample .",
    "[ vits1 ]    [ vitsc ]    [ vits2 ]    [ vits4 ]    [ vits3 ]      a peak in the velocity distribution at 14000  is observed for sc ( fig .",

    "this peak corresponds to the `` foreground group '' detected by using the serna & gerbal ( 1996 ) hierarchical method and identified on the x - ray image with the excess to the west of abcg 85 ( durret et al .",

    "a dip at @xmath17  follows the  ( see figs .",
    "[ vitsc ] and [ vits3 ] ) .",
    "notice that the galaxy samples a89 , c87 and c1 contain no galaxy velocities smaller than @xmath18 , while this is not the case for the a87 sample ( fig .",
    "[ vits2 ] ) ; in all these samples , most of the galaxy velocities lie between 15000 and 19000 .    in the case of sc ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ vitsc ] ) , a89 , c89 , c87 and for the two control samples c1 and c2 , a maximum is observed at @xmath19 .",
    "these velocity distributions are clearly not gaussian for any of the samples .    at a smaller scale , in the case of sc , the velocity density breaks into a two - maxima density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ vitsc ] , bottom panel ) with a first maximum at @xmath20  followed by a dip ( the  in the following ) at @xmath21 , then a second maximum at @xmath22  followed by a shoulder at @xmath23  .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the velocity of this second maximum is very close to that of the cd galaxy .",
    "even if the relative levels of peaks and dips are not the same for both samples , the succession of features in the sc velocity density distribution is very similar to that in the density profile of a87 ( fig .",
    "[ vits2 ] , top panel ) : a first maximum followed by the then a second maximum .    in several samples we observe a similar succession of maxima and minima , such as the 14000  maximum , a small dip at 15000 , the  at 16100 , and a maximum at @xmath19  ( figs .",
    "[ vitsc ] , [ vits2 ] and [ vits3 ] ) .",

    "[ xy ]    [ cone ]    [ artist ]    figure [ xy ] shows the distribution in the plane of the sky of galaxies with measured velocities , colour coded for various velocity ranges .",
    "this figure illustrates the difficulty in untangling structures projected on the plane of the sky , even if they have very different velocities .",
    "we can note however that two structures are visible : a condensation of `` yellow galaxies '' in the region of abcg 89 ( but galaxies in this velocity range also can be found elsewhere ) , and `` dark blue galaxies '' corresponding to the .",
    "besides , there seems to be an enhancement of galaxies aligned along pa@xmath11160 .",
    "we show two cone diagrams for the velocity distribution , which are displayed in fig .  [ cone ] .",
    "both panels show evidence for various substructures along the line of sight .",
    "the bulk of the galaxies ( the purple and red points in the figures ) correspond to abcg 85 .    in the left panel of fig",
    ".  [ cone ] , the  is clearly visible ( dark blue points ) , and it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ xy ] that this group is quite compact and concentrated ( in projection ) towards the center - west of the cluster .",
    "the abcg 87 cluster itself , or rather the region south - east of abcg 85 , appears to be composed of several subgroups with velocities somewhat lower than the median cluster velocity ( green points ) .",
    "these subgroups , defined in velocity space , have x - ray counterparts ( fig .  [ excessx ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ artist ] we place each subgroup at its x - ray position and represent it in the right ascension - velocity plane ( the velocities are in fact the various peaks observed in fig .",
    "[ vits2 ] ) , we observe a filament pointing towards abcg 85 .",
    "this suggests that a stream of material is falling onto the main core of abcg 85 .",
    "the south blob ( the extended x - ray feature @xmath9 south of the cd ) would then be the meeting point ( see fig .",
    "[ excessx ] ) and corresponds to a hot region in the asca temperature map ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the two structures with the largest velocities ( yellow and cyan points ) seem to trace two sheets of galaxies ( referred to as the near and remote sheets in fig .  [ artist ] ) .",
    "both structures are inclined along the line of sight , and appear to intersect .",
    "these two sheets may lie on the surface of a large bubble which intersects our field of view .",
    "note also the coalignment , along the line of sight , of the foreground group , abcg 85 , a89b , and a89c .",
    "this could indicate the presence of a second filament directly along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , the two filaments could be concentrations in a sheet .",
    "notice the existence of a dozen galaxies with velocities slightly higher than that for most of the abcg 85 galaxies which indicate a lower density region of the line of sight filament .",
    "we presented a three dimensional model of the complex abcg 85/87/89 region .",
    "we find a general extension observed toward the south - east along pa@xmath24  both in x - rays and in optical photometric observations :    - in x - rays , the elongated structure extends to the edge of the rosat pspc field of view ; the x - ray appearance includes several individual group - like systems lying up to about 4  mpc ( in projection ) from the center of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ xcont ] ) as well as very elongated diffuse emission ;    - from the optical photometric catalogue , abcg 85 is elongated towards the abcg 87 cluster ( see fig .  [ kernel ] ) .",
    "the pa@xmath24  is characteristic for abcg 85 : the direction of the major axis , the brightest galaxies in abcg 85 , and even the major axis of the central cd galaxy itself are elongated along the same direction .    east of abcg 85 lies abcg 89 which is not bright in x - rays .",
    "our velocity data reveal that abcg 89 is not a cluster , but the superposition on the sky of two groups well separated in velocity space .",
    "these two groups ( to which we refer as a89b & a89c in fig .  [ artist ] ) are located in intersecting sheets on opposite sides of a large bubble .",
    "we have shown that abcg 87 is not a rich cluster , but is resolved into individual groups possibly falling onto abcg 85 .",
    "these groups are organized as a filament almost perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "the superposition of these groups gives the appearance of a single optical cluster , while in x - rays , several groups are still visible : this is probably due to the fact that the emissivity in x - rays is proportional to the density squared , therefore enhancing the contrast , compared to optical imaging .      in his scenario for the coma cluster , west ( 1997 )",
    "links the orientations of coma to the filament in which coma is embedded .",
    "he suggests that matter , including galaxies , groups and gas , falls onto the cluster along this filament .",
    "the case of abcg 85 reinforces this cosmological scenario because _",
    "we actually observe _ the infall of material ( a filament of groups of galaxies and gas ) onto abcg 85 .",
    "this result is consistent with the x - ray temperature map derived from asca data by markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which shows a temperature enhancement in a region south of abcg 85 and roughly perpendicular to the general direction of 160  along which the various structures are aligned .",
    "such a temperature increase could be interpreted as shock heating due to the compression of the x - ray gas by infalling matter .",
    "the fact that there also appears to be a radio relic , also roughly perpendicular to the 160  direction , in this zone ( bagchi et al .",
    "1998 ) also supports recent merger activity , since relativisitic electrons can be produced during a merger .",
    "remarkably , the abcg 85/87 filament is coaligned with a much larger structure including from northwest to southeast : abcg 70 , abcg 85 and 89 , abcg 87 , abcg 91 , the ngc 255 group and abcg 106 ( fig .  1 in slezak et al .",
    "such a structure extends over more than 5  on the sky , corresponding to a linear distance of 28 mpc at the redshift of abcg 85 ( z=0.0555 ) .",
    "this is obviously a lower limit , since the filament may be inclined to the line of sight . although this projected value is smaller than that found for example for the perseus pisces structure ( 50@xmath25 mpc , haynes & giovanelli 1986 ) , it is nevertheless much larger than typical cluster sizes . unfortunately , there are only very few redshifts available for this large structure outside the abcg 85/87/89 complex .",
    "further optical observations are required to confirm the cohesiveness of this remarkable filamentary structure .",
