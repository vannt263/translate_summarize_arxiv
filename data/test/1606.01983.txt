    "a long gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is one of the most energetic explosions in the universe , which is observed via soft gamma - ray emission followed by afterglow in lower energy range .",
    "it is now broadly agreed that at least some of long grbs originate in core - collapse of massive stars together with core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne ) . however , cc sne do not always accompany long grbs , and the criteria discriminating between long grbs and general cc sne is one of the most important questions regarding long grbs .",
    "some theoretical studies on the origin of long grbs using stellar evolution models suggest that low - metallicity may be a necessary condition for a long grb to occur ( @xmath3 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity distribution of long grb host galaxies provides us with an important clue to study the relation between metallicity and a long grb occurrence .",
    "although metallicity of a long grb host galaxy is not necessarily identical to that of the progenitor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxies with low - metallicity would have higher grb production efficiency [ i.e. , long grb rate to star formation rate ( sfr ) ratio ] than high - metal galaxies if low - metallicity is a necessary condition for a long grb to occur .",
    "with a sample of 5 host galaxies ( 3 long grbs and 2 x - ray flashes , xrfs ) , ( , hereafter s06 ) showed that the metallicity distribution of the host galaxies at redshifts @xmath4 is significantly biased towards low - metallicities compared with star forming galaxies at similar redshifts , suggesting long grbs really occur in low - metallicity environment .",
    "however their sample is too small to determine the relation between metallicity and long grb occurrence rate .",
    "the sample number of spectroscopically studied long grb host galaxies has been dramatically increased during the 10 years after s06 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the relation between metallicity and long grb occurrence rate is not understood quantitatively .",
    "one difficulty is that we can determine redshifts and/or identify host galaxies of only a small fraction of long grbs ( @xmath1 30% in recent observations ) , which is likely biased with respect to the distributions of redshifts and host galaxy properties ( the @xmath5-determination / host - identification bias ) .",
    "furthermore , even when the redshift and the host galaxy of a long grb are known , the host galaxy is not always studied in detail .",
    "the targets of the spectroscopic studies have been selected non - uniformly by numerous independent researchers making the effect of the sampling bias unevaluable ( the reporting bias , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there have been some previous long grb host observation campaigns invented to overcome the sampling biases ( so called unbiased surveys , @xcite ) . in the unbiased surveys ,",
    "the samples are selected without using informations about redshifts and host galaxies to avoid the @xmath5-determination / host - identification bias , and hence the samples span a very wide range of redshifts ( @xmath6 0-6 ) . in such a wide range of redshift , properties of general galaxies largely evolve making it difficult to reach enough statistics to study the environmental requirements for a long grb occurrence by comparing the properties of grb host galaxies to those of general galaxies .",
    "some recent studies pick out grb host galaxies in specific ranges of redshifts from the unbiased surveys and compared their properties to those of general galaxies at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of general galaxies , to which we compare long grb host galaxies to investigate the environmental requirements for a long grb occurrence , are still not well understood at high - redshifts .",
    "metallicity measurement of high - redshift galaxies is an especially challenging issue ( at @xmath7 , e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the sample number becomes very small at low - redshifts in the unbiased surveys ( @xmath8 grbs at @xmath9 ) because the cosmic long grb rate density is low and the comoving volume element is small , although long grb host galaxies at low - redshifts are of special importance to understand the relation between metallicity and long grb occurrence rate as we describe below .",
    "hence , although the unbiased surveys are important to understand what bias we would suffer by selecting long grbs whose redshifts and host galaxies are known , it is difficult to unveil the environmental requirements for a long grb occurrence only with the unbiased surveys .",
    "metallicity measurements of the host galaxies of all long grbs known at low - redshifts ( @xmath10 ) can dramatically improve our understanding of the relation between metallicity and long grb occurrence rate .",
    "there are advantages of studying grb host galaxies at low - redshift in some aspects .    1 .   the success rate of grb redshift - determinations / host - identifications would be higher at lower redshifts ( i.e.",
    ", the @xmath5-determination / host - identification bias is weaker ) , because faint galaxies can be detected without very deep observations and spectroscopies of host galaxies can provide redshift informations even when grb afterglows are not bright enough for spectroscopies .",
    "the reporting bias can be eliminated by finding host galaxies of all grbs known in the redshift range and measuring metallicities of all host galaxies , which is difficult to do at higher redshifts ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "3 .   a wealth of spectroscopic studies of general galaxies at low - redshifts , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , provides us with control sample of galaxy properties , to which we can compare long grb host properties to investigate the relation between long grb rate and metallicity .",
    "the advantages and the disadvantages of a redshift selected study of grb host galaxies at low - redshifts can be summarized as in table  [ tab : procon ] , in comparison with the other strategies of grb host studies .    in this study , we present the overall metallicity distribution of the host galaxies of grbs known at @xmath12 that occurred before the end of march 2014 .",
    "for a few of this low - redshift host galaxies , sufficient spectroscopic data to constrain their metallicity were not previously available in the literature , or signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of important metallicity indicating emission lines was low .",
    "we perform spectroscopic metallicity measurements of the host galaxies of three low - redshift grbs , 060614 , 090417b , and 130427a , to obtain better constraints on the metallicity distribution .",
    "we compare the metallicity distribution of this low - redshift sample to the predictions of empirical models of galaxies , and constrain the relation between metallicity and grb occurrence rate .",

    "although there are various classes of gamma - ray burst like events : e.g. , long grbs , short grbs , ultra - long grbs , and xrfs , we focus on host galaxies of long grbs in this study .",
    "the classification of burst events are still controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and important burst properties for the classification such as burst duration @xmath18 , and spectral peak energy @xmath19 are uncertain in some cases . however , for simplicity , we select long grbs simply by reported @xmath18 and @xmath19 as follows .",
    "the prompt emission properties are taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in addition to the online databases mentioned above .",

    "xrfs are often defined according to their hardness ratio which depends on energy bands of x - ray detectors . to take into account burst events discovered by various instruments ,",

    "however , we exclude grb 050219 from further discussion in this study , leaving 14 low - redshift long grbs in our sample , because it is unclear whether this burst really has occurred at a low - redshift .",
    "grb 050219 occurred close to ( but @xmath1 offset from ) an early - galaxy for which the redshift @xmath28 is measured @xcite .",
    "given that long grbs result from death of massive stars , the association of grb 050219 with an early - type galaxy is surprising , although it is not strictly prohibited because early - type galaxies can harbour small amount of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the significant offset of grb 050219 from its claimed host galaxy also suggests that the galaxy might be aligned with the grb by chance without any physical association with the burst .",

    "the faint end of the grb luminosity function is still controversial affected by sample selections and model assumptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is difficult to estimate the actual rate and evaluate the redshift success rate of low - luminosity grbs .    on the other hand , it is also true that redshift determination of a grb has failed ( partly ) due to the weak emission line of the host galaxy .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : obs:111225a ] , the redshift of grb 111225a has not been determined until @xcite reports detections of weak emission lines over the afterglow together with a marginal absorption line using an updated analysis tool . the failure of the redshift determination in the immediate follow up observations after the burst suggests that grb host galaxies with @xmath180 might be missed in redshift selected samples , given that the stellar mass of the grb 111225a host galaxy is naively @xmath181 ( section  [ sec : host_msfr ] ) .      another interesting case is the identification of the host galaxy of grb 020819b .",

    "however , recent extensive observations of the host galaxy by @xcite showed that the `` blob '' is actually a dusty starforming galaxy at @xmath183 , and the low - redshift spiral galaxy is possibly a foreground object unrelated to the grb .",
    "hence it is possible that a few of the low - redshift grbs in our sample whose redshifts are obtained only via their host galaxies actually reside in high - redshift galaxies which are too faint to be observed , and currently claimed host galaxies at low - redshifts are foreground objects .",
    "although most of the low - redshift grbs are closely located to the center of their host galaxies within @xmath184 unlike grb 020819b , it is difficult to robustly confirm that a `` low - redshift '' grb is actually at a low - redshift when the grb does not have an afterglow measured redshift or a confirmed sn association ( grb 060505 , 080517 , 060614 , 050826 , and 090417b , see table  [ tab : grbs ] ) . furthermore , among the low - redshift grbs without robust redshift confirmations , grb 060505 and 080517 have offsets @xmath185 from the center of their host , although the large offsets are not surprising given their very low - redshifts @xmath186 .",
    "it should be noted that the originally claimed host galaxy of grb 020819b at @xmath182 was a massive - spiral galaxy with the highest metallicity in the known grb host galaxies .",
    "when a grb host galaxy sample is contaminated by unrelated forground galaxies , it is possible that the contaminants tend to be brighter galaxies because they can be found more easily than the actual host galaxies which are likely faint .",
    "missing redshift informations for grbs in faint galaxies and contamination by bright foreground galaxies may bias the metallicity distribution of the overall population towards higher - metallicities , in contrast to what is expected in the case of the bias against `` dark '' grbs .",
    "we have presented the overall metallicity distribution of the host galaxies of all grbs known at @xmath12 that occurred before the end of march 2014 , including the newly obtained emission line fluxes of the host galaxies of grb 060614 , 090417b , and 130427a .",
    "the low - redshift sample of grb host galaxies with complete metallicity measurements is essential to study the nature of grb progenitor in some aspects : 1 ) the high success rate of redshift determinations and host identifications , 2 ) the reporting bias can be eliminated by completing the metallicity measurements , and 3 ) a wealth of comparison sample is available .",
    "we have compared the metallicity distribution of the low - redshift sample with the predictions from the empirical formulations of the properties of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "to predict the metallicity distribution , we adopted models of grb efficiency ( @xmath187 ) as functions of metallicity .",
    "the metallicity of the progenitor stars considered here is not necessarily identical to that of its host galaxy . instead , we considered the metallicity variation within each galaxy motivated by the observations of h regions in nearby galaxies .",
    "the three different formulations of @xmath105 , namely the step function , power - law , and exponential models are examined .",
    "each of the three @xmath105 models has two free parameters that can be used to fit the metallicity distribution of the host galaxies . in either case , @xmath105 function with a sharp cutoff around 12+log@xmath55(o / h)@xmath188 8.3 ( @xmath189 )",

    "this result is in contrast to the results of some previous studies which have suggested the cutoff metallicity @xmath1 0.5@xmath192 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because we take the internal variation of metallicity within each galaxy into account .",
    "our galaxy models also indicate the cutoff metallicity around 0.51@xmath59 , when the internal metallicity variation is assumed to be smaller ( 0.20.1 dex ) in any galaxy",
    ". however , the current model of the internal metallicity variation relies on the observed metallicity distributions of h regions in a small number of local galaxies , and the actual internal metallicity variation in grb host galaxies is hardly known .",

    "the relation between the nature of grb progenitor stars and the observable properties of their host galaxy depends on the internal and global properties of galaxies .",
    "better understanding on the general population of galaxies at each redshift is essential to obtain more robust constraints on the properties of grb progenitors , in addition to gathering larger less biased sample of grb host galaxies .    because we collected grbs with known redshifts ( @xmath0 ) in this study",
    ", it is possible that the sample of the host galaxies is biased for a kind of galaxy population in which grb redshift determination is easy ( e.g. , galaxies with smaller dust content ) , although the grb redshift determination is generally easier at lower - redshifts .",
    "however , the number of low - redshift grbs in our sample is close to the number expected from the latest unbiased surveys , suggesting a high success rate of redshift determinations at low - redshifts , although the statistical error is still large .",
    "furthermore , the obtained metallicities do not show significant systematic trend with respect to burst energy ( @xmath167 ) and redshift .",
    "thus there is no sign that the low - redshift sample of the grb host galaxies is biased compared to the actual population of grb host galaxies , although the tests are not robust yet .    on the other hand , the failure of the redshift determination of grb 111225a in the immediate follow up observations after the burst suggests that faint ( and thus low - metallicity ) host galaxies might be systematically missed in the redshift selected sample .",
