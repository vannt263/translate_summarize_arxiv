    "most of the presently known extragalactic very high energy ( vhe , above @xmath3  gev ) @xmath0-ray emitters ( @xmath840 ) are blazars .",
    "so far only two radio galaxies , m  87 @xcite and cen  a @xcite , and two starburst galaxies , ngc 253 @xcite and m82 @xcite , have been clearly identified in this energy range .",
    "ic  310 ( redshift z=0.019 ) is a head - tail radio galaxy located in the perseus cluster at @xmath9 ( corresponding to @xmath8 1mpc ) from the cluster s central galaxy , ngc  1275 .",
    "head - tail radio galaxies display a radio morphology consisting of a bright head , close to the optical galaxy and a fainter , elongated tail . in the standard explanation ,",
    "the jets are bent towards one direction creating the  head \" structure . at larger distances they fan out in a characteristic tail that extends over many tens to hundreds of kpc . when the flow of intracluster medium ( icm ) impacting these galaxies ( in their rest frame ) is supersonic ( mach number larger than @xmath10 ) , the ram pressure of the icm causes the jets to bend @xcite .",
    "if the flow is transsonic ( mach number @xmath11 ) , the thermal pressure gradient of the interstellar medium of these galaxies , due to their motion through the icm , determines the bending @xcite . in this last model ,",
    "the inflow is decelerated and heated by a bow shock in front of the galaxy , which also generates a turbulent wake that re - accelerates the relativistic particle population in the tail and illuminates the tail .",
    "the radio contours of ic  310 show an extended emission , pointing away from the direction of ngc  1275 .",
    "the length of this tail measured in radio varies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray image of ic  310 observed by xmm - newton is compatible with a point - like emission from the core and with no x - ray emission from its extended radio structure @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also showed that the x - ray emission may originate from the central agn of the bl lac - type object .",
    "other observed characteristics of ic  310 ( e.g.  no strong emission lines , spectral indexes in radio and x - ray ) suggest that it may also be a dim ( weakly beamed ) blazar @xcite .    the lat instrument on board the _ fermi _ satellite @xcite has recently detected ic  310 @xcite with 5 ( 3 ) photons above @xmath14  gev ( above @xmath15  gev ) . at lower energy ( i.e.  from @xmath15  mev to @xmath10  gev ) , only the cluster s central galaxy , ngc  1275 , is visible @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present the results of recent observations of the perseus cluster performed with the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescopes and the detection of ic  310 ( atel  # 2510 ) .",
    "magic consists of two 17  m imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) located at the roque de los muchachos , canary island of la palma ( @xmath16n , @xmath17w ) , at the height of 2200 m a.s.l .",
    "the commissioning of the second magic telescope was finished in 2009 , and since the end of 2009 both telescopes work together in stereo mode @xcite .",
    "the stereo observations provide an excellent sensitivity of @xmath18% of the crab flux ( c.u . ) in the medium energy range in 50  hr of observations @xcite .",
    "the magic  i telescope was used to observe the perseus cluster for a total of 94  hr between november 2008 and february 2010 .",
    "the analysis of 33.4  hr of data taken in 2008 was presented in @xcite ; it focused on the physics of the perseus cluster and ngc  1275 .",
    "the skymap presented in @xcite does not show significant excesses in the ic  310 position . since the end of october 2009 the second magic telescope was also taking data , allowing the stereoscopic analysis .",
    "observations were performed in the so - called wobble mode @xcite , with data equally split in two pointing positions offset by @xmath19 from the direction of ngc  1275 .",
    "ic  310 was in the field of view at the angular distance of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for individual wobble positions .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray collection area in the latter case is significantly lower ( by a factor of @xmath22 ) , only data with @xmath20 offset were used for the signal search and for obtaining the spectrum and the light curve .",
    "we separately analyzed the magic  i single telescope ( hereafter mono ) and stereo data .",
    "the mono and stereo are only partially independent systems , differing in the analysis method , thus there can be some residual systematic error between them . for single telescope observations , the systematic error in the determination of the flux is @xmath23 @xcite . additionally , ic  310 was not observed in the standard wobble observation mode ; this increases the systematic error from the background estimate .",
    "the mono data are treated with the standard magic  i analysis chain @xcite . in the analysis of the stereo data we took advantage of the impact parameters with respect to each telescope and the height of the shower maximum .",
    "those stereo parameters improve the gamma / hadron separation and the energy reconstruction ( @xcite ; magic stereo performance paper , in prep . ) .",
    "we used a new method to reconstruct the arrival directions that improves the angular resolution and the sensitivity of the magic telescopes .",
    "the method is based on the  disp rf \" technique ( see @xcite for details ) , adapted to the stereo observations .",
    "the estimate of an arrival direction is performed independently for each telescope using the shape and time information of a corresponding image . in order to obtain the best performance , those are combined with the crossing point of the main axes of the images from both telescopes .",
    "we also analyzed _ fermi _ data taken during the period between 2008 august 4 and 2010 july 15 following the approach of @xcite .",
    "the data were filtered with _ gtselect _",
    "tool and the _ fermi _ exposure at the source position was calculated using _ gtexposure _ tool .",
    "only events of `` diffuse '' class were retained in the analysis .",
    "we obtained the spectrum of ic  310 in the @xmath24  gev energy band in two different ways .",
    "first , we performed a spectral fit using the standard _",
    "unbinned likelihood analysis , taking into account all sources from the @xmath25 year _ fermi _ catalog @xcite within @xmath26 of ic  310 .",
    "we then obtain spectral points by extracting photon counts from the circle of radius @xmath27 centered on the source .",
    "taking into account the proximity to a bright , nearby source ( radio galaxy ngc  1275 ) , we estimated the background by taking three apertures at @xmath9 away from ngc  1275 ( see fig.[fermi_counts ] ) .",

    "after the data quality check , we obtained a sample for the period from october 2009 to february 2010 , of 20.6  hr of magic stereo data .",
    "the theta@xmath30 ( squared distance between true and reconstructed source position ; see e.g.  @xcite ) distribution of the signal coming from ic  310 and the background estimation are shown in fig .",
    "[ theta2plot ] ( left panel ) .",
    "we found an excess of 106 events , corresponding to a @xmath31  @xmath32 significance ( calculated according to the prescription by @xcite , eq.17 ) .    the source was also detected in the 27.5  hr of mono data ( september 2009  february 2010 ) with a significance of @xmath33  @xmath32 .",
    "note that since part of the magic  i data set are also used in the stereo analysis , the two significances are not completely independent .",
    "the corresponding alpha ( the angle between the main axis of the @xmath0-ray induced shower image and direction to the true source position ; see e.g.  @xcite ) distribution is also shown fig .  [ theta2plot ] ( middle panel ) .",
    "the different signal significance obtained in stereo ( @xmath34 ) is similar to the one of mono scaled to the same observation time ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is because the mono data have been taken over a longer time period , including a higher emission state in october 2009 ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , in significance calculated according to @xcite the background is estimated using both on and off measurements .",
    "thus for a high signal / background ratio ( as in the case of excellent gamma / hadron separation obtained in stereo observations ) , the background is overestimated and this lowers the significance . on the other hand",
    "a simple calculation of @xmath36 scaled to the same observation time gives a higher value for stereo , @xmath37 , than for mono , @xmath38 , observations .",

    "until february 2010 , the _ fermi_-lat instrument observed only three photons with energies above @xmath15  gev from the direction of ic  310 @xcite .",

    ", we obtain the differential flux @xmath58 .",
    "the _ fermi _ spectral index is very hard , mostly due to the last point .",
    "the magic telescopes have detected vhe @xmath0-ray emission with high statistical significance from the direction of ic  310 with a mean @xmath0-ray flux above @xmath3  gev , between october 2009 and february 2010 , of @xmath45  c.u .",
    "the source seems to be variable on the time scales from weeks to about one year .",
    "no significant excesses were observed in the 2008 mono data and flares are possibly present at the @xmath59  @xmath32 level in october and november 2009 .",
    "the stereo observations yield a spectrum that is well fitted by a simple power law with a spectral index of @xmath2 .",
    "the magic angular resolution is not sufficient to determine the location of the vhe emission region within the radio galaxy .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether the observed @xmath0-ray emission is connected with the tail of the source or if it is produced at the base of the jet , close to the central engine of the source ( as in blazars ) .",
    "the strong indications of variability disfavor the @xmath0-ray production at the bow shock , discussed by @xcite , because in this case the emission should be steady on time scales of thousands of years .",
    "variability with a time scale of a year ( a week ) constrains the size of emission region to be @xmath60  cm ( @xmath61  cm ) across , assuming no doppler boosting of the flux , which is much smaller than the total size of the tail ( @xmath62  cm ) .",
    "additionally , one can estimate the mass of the central black hole , @xmath63 , of an active galaxy using the correlation between black hole mass and the central velocity dispersion of the host galaxy @xcite . the measured velocity dispersion in ic  310 ( @xmath64  km / s , @xcite ) yields @xmath65 , corresponding to a schwarzschild radius of @xmath66  cm .",
    "this indicates that the most probable location of the @xmath0-ray emission region is in the innermost part of the jet ( as e.g.  for m  87 , see * ? ? ?",
    "the extrapolation of the ic  310 spectrum obtained with the magic telescopes is in good agreement with the _ fermi _ spectrum below 60  gev . on the other hand",
    ", there is a large deviation in the last energy bin measured by _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux from our observations in this energy bin predicts 0.6 photons , while 4 photons were observed by _",
    "assuming a poisson distribution , the probability of obtaining @xmath67 photons is @xmath68 ( corresponding to @xmath69 standard deviations ) so the discrepancy may be a statistical fluctuation .",
    "however , the _ fermi_-lat , having an energy resolution of @xmath70 , observed 3 of the 4 photons with nearly the same energies ( 98.5 , 105 , and 111  gev ) .",
    "if confirmed by future observations , these events may indicate the presence of a peculiar peak or bump in the ic  310 spectrum given that the remaining _",
    "fermi_-lat data agree with the magic measurement .",
    "the detection of such a relatively narrow feature in the spectrum of a radio galaxy may be a clue regarding the particle acceleration mechanism at the base of agn jets ( e.g.   direct  gamma - ray emission during acceleration of particles , * ? ? ?",
    "this remains a suggestion since the source seems to be variable , and the magic and _ fermi _ data used here were not taken simultaneously .    the combined magic and _ fermi _ spectrum ( besides the above mentioned bump ) is consistent with a flat @xmath71 spectrum stretching without a break over more than @xmath55 orders of magnitude in energy ( 2  gev  7  tev ) .",
    "this is similar to the flat vhe spectra of m 87 , another radio galaxy detected at tev energies @xcite .",
    "such an extended , flat @xmath71 spectrum is hard to obtain in a simple one - zone ssc model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . instead",
    ", a viable model of emission might be inverse compton scattering of external ir photon background photons from accretion flow or from the inner jet ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a flat spectrum can be produced in the hadronic models ( e.g.  the proton blazar model , @xcite ) . in more complicated , multi - zone leptonic models ,",
    "the gev - tev emission of a few slightly shifted inverse compton peaks can also emulate a flat spectrum ( e.g.  spine - sheath layer model , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , using the model by @xcite , we find that the change in the spectrum due to the absorption in the extragalactic background light radiation field is within the error of the spectral slope .",
    "ic  310 and ngc  1265 were the first two head - tail galaxy discovered by astronomers @xcite .",
    "now , ic  310 is the first head - tail radio galaxy detected in the vhe @xmath0-rays by ground based telescopes as well as by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite .",
    "additionally , it is also the first source discovered above @xmath3  gev by the magic telescopes working together in stereo mode .",
    "this detection is important also for the vhe study of the perseus cluster of galaxies .",
    "it may imply a substantial injection of high energy particles in the icm by a non - central agn .",
    "those particles might have important consequences on the possible cluster @xmath0-ray emission due to cosmic - ray acceleration @xcite .",
    "the vhe ic  310 detection significantly enriches our knowledge of the @xmath0-ray universe .",
