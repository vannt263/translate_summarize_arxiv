    "according to the model of agns , cold material close to the central black hole forms an accretion disc , matter inside which due to the dissipative forces transports inwards causing the accretion disc to heat up . such a hot material in turn can inverse - compton scatter photons up to x - ray energies @xcite . from high energy",
    "astronomical sources a special interest deserve blazar type agns the standard model of which implies the presence of the supermassive black hole , surrounded by the accretion disc and ejecting twin relativistic jets .",
    "the observationally evident broadband emission spectrum of blazars is made of two components : the low energy ( from radio to optical ) domain attributed to the synchrotron emission and the high energy ( from @xmath1-rays to @xmath0-rays ) part formed by either the inverse - compton mechanism @xcite or the curvature radiation @xcite .",
    "a recent investigation of the parsec scale jets is very important .",
    "@xcite argued that the high energy and radio emissions are strongly correlated . our model on the other hand ,",
    "as we will see , automatically provides a connection of radiation in high energy and radio domains .",
    "magnetospheres of agns have strong magnetic fields , therefore , synchrotron cooling timescales are relatively short , leading to efficient energy losses .",
    "this in turn creates appropriate conditions for particles to transit to their ground landau state .",
    "when this happens , relativistic electrons will move only along magnetic field lines without emitting in the synchrotron regime .",
    "despite the very strong magnetic field , which prevents a continuous process of the synchrotron emission , there is a possibility to overcome the dissipative factors and maintain the radiation mechanism . @xcite",
    "have studied the cyclotron instability of two - component electron - positron plasma for the pulsar , np 0532 .",
    "it was found that the instability arises near the light cylinder surface ( a hypothetical zone , where the linear velocity of rigid rotation equals exactly the speed of light ) leading to a certain distribution of particles by pitch angles and the consequent synchrotron radiation . @xcite",
    "considered the magnetospheres of the pulsar np 0532 and the crab nebula , studying the generation of waves from optical to gamma - ray domains .",
    "the similar approach was presented by @xcite where the qld was applied to the radio pulsars .",
    "the authors found that the transverse momenta of relativistic particles induced by the cyclotron instability caused the stable non - zero pitch angle distribution maintained by means of the qld . analyzing the data obtained from magic cherenkov telescope between 2007 october and 2008 february @xcite we found that , the observed coincidence of signals in the optical and @xmath0-ray domains are easily explained by the qld process , which leads to the increase of the pitch angles , making the synchrotron process feasible @xcite .    in the magnetospheres of agns the magnetic fields are of the order of @xmath2 @xcite , close to the supermassive black hole , and @xmath3 close to the light cylinder surface .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned qld mechanism could be of great importance for agns as well . for this purpose by considering the cyclotron instability excited in the radio domain , in @xcite we studied the quasi - linear interaction of proper modes of agn magnetospheric plasmas with the resonant plasma particles investigating the qld in the context of producing the soft and hard x - ray emission from agns . under favorable conditions",
    "this mechanism could also be efficient for explaining the mev - gev energy synchrotron emission , strongly connected either with the submilimeter radio band , or with the infrared emission induced by the cyclotron instability .",
    "this will be the subject of the present paper , which is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our model , in sect .",
    "3 we apply the mechanism of qld to agns and in sect .",
    "4 we summarize our results .",
    "in general , agn magnetospheres consist of relatively low energy particles and very high energy particles ( electrons ) . therefore , in the framework of the model we consider the plasma composed of two components : a ) the so - called plasma component with the lorentz factor , @xmath4 and b ) the beam component with the lorentz factor , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "such a system as was shown by @xcite undergoes the cyclotron instability induced by the doppler effect with the following resonance condition @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the longitudinal ( parallel to the background magnetic field ) component of the wave vector , @xmath9 is the component along the drift , @xmath10 is the longitudinal component of plasma flow velocity , @xmath11 is the drift velocity of particles , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is field line s curvature radius , @xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath15 is the magnetic induction and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are electron s charge and the rest mass , respectively .",
    "positive sign corresponds to the damping of the excited modes , whereas the negative sign relates to the unstable mode .",
    "one can show that , when the aforementioned resonance takes place , the transverse waves with the dispersion relation @xmath18 are induced .",
    "@xmath19 is the modulus of the wave vector , @xmath20 is the plasma frequency and @xmath21 is the plasma density . from eqs .",
    "( [ cycl],[disp1 ] ) is clear that the excited cyclotron frequency is given by @xcite @xmath22 in spite of the resonant character of the cyclotron modes , the corresponding frequency is not well peeked , because @xmath23 depends also on the lorentz factors of the resonant ( beam ) particles , that do not have narrow energy spectra .",
    "it is worth noting that unlike the synchrotron mechanism ( @xmath24 ) , ( @xmath25 is the wavelength ) , where radiation process can be described by a single particle approach , excitation of the aforementioned waves is a collective phenomenon ( @xmath26 ) , which in its turn is a direct consequence of one - dimensionality of the distribution function . on the other hand ,",
    "such a behaviour of this function is guaranteed by the strong magnetic field that forces particles to move along the field lines .    by the first sentence after eq .",
    "3 we would like to note that despite the resonant character of the process , the corresponding frequency is not well peeked , because the frequency depends also on the lorentz factor of the resonant particles , and the corresponding interval of @xmath5-s is not narrow    in general , two dissipative factors lead to a decrease of the pitch angle . the force that provides conservation of adiabatic invariant @xmath27 in non - uniform magnetic field @xcite [ see also @xcite ] @xmath28 and the radiation reaction force @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the pitch angle . only under the action of these forces",
    "the pitch angles tend to decrease , inevitably killing the synchrotron emission . in reality",
    "the situation is principally different , because the excited relatively low frequency waves ( in our case submillimeter / infrared ) by means of the cyclotron resonance leads to the qld . unlike the dissipative effects of ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , diffusion creates non - zero distribution function with respect to pitch angles , and supports the synchrotron emission .",
    "it is clear that under favorable conditions the effect of quasi - linear diffusion may balance the dissipation , therefore , our objective is to find the distribution of particles by pitch angles , estimate their mean value and analyze the corresponding synchrotron emission energy . on the other hand , since the qld results from the feedback of the cyclotron modes , apart from the high energy emission , the system will also be characterized by the low energy radiation .",
    "in @xcite we studied the role of the qld in producing the x - ray emission by means of ultra - relativistic electrons in agn magnetospheric flows .",
    "it was shown that the cyclotron resonance provides emission in a low energy domain - radio band .",
    "unlike the physical conditions ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) considered in @xcite , in the present paper we examine physically different regime , @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the distribution function of particles and @xmath39 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "@xmath40 is the energy density per unit wavelength , therefore the energy density of the cyclotron waves are of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 of the resonant plasma energy , @xmath43 , converts to waves @xcite , then for an expression of @xmath40 one obtains @xcite @xmath44 ) is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 unlike the work presented in @xcite , due to the different regime , @xmath47 behaves as @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 [ see eq .",
    "( 11 ) in @xcite ] .",
    "as we see , particles are distributed by the pitch angles , therefore , the electrons will emit via the synchrotron process without damping .",
    "in this section we apply the model of the qld to the light cylinder lengthscales of typical agns .    for explaining the high energy radiation",
    ", it is strongly believed that agn magnetospheres are consist of highly relativistic electrons .",
    "this fact sets another problem - how to accelerate these particles to such high energies ?",
    "in general , there are several mechanisms , which may account for the efficient acceleration of electrons .",
    "indeed , as is shown in a series of papers , fermi - type acceleration process @xcite , re - acceleration of electron - positron pairs as a feedback mechanism @xcite and centrifugal acceleration @xcite may provide very high lorentz factors of the order of @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the paper an existence of such particles is assumed to be as a given fact .",
    "if we suppose an isotropic distribution of relativistic electrons , one can estimate the synchrotron cooling timescale @xcite @xmath51 the value of the magnetic induction is given by @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the bolometric luminosity of the agn and @xmath54 is the light cylinder radius ( a hypothetical zone , where the linear velocity of rigid rotation exactly equals the speed of light ) .",
    "@xmath55 is the magnetic field lines angular velocity of rotation , normalized to the value @xmath56 @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is robust enough to maintain the frozen - in condition in the magnetosphere of the agn . indeed , as one can see , for the typical magnetospheric parameters , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the following condition @xmath59 is satisfied , which means that the plasma particles will be forced to follow the rigidly rotating field lines .",
    "during such a motion , especially on the light cylinder lengthscales , the electrons will undergo the centrifugal force accelerating them up to very high lorentz factors @xmath60 @xcite    it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ ts ] ) that for a certain class of physical parameters the synchrotron cooling timescale is of the order of @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinematic timescale of the system , @xmath62 is by many orders of magnitude bigger than @xmath63 , which in turn means that without the quasi - linear diffusion , particles very soon would stop emitting in the synchrotron regime , after transiting to their ground landau level .",
    "@xcite showed that the anomalous doppler effect generates the cyclotron waves with the frequency @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 leading to the process of the quasi - linear diffusion , which , despite the efficient dissipative factors , creates the pitch angles .    to demonstrate the present model",
    ", we consider an agn with the bolometric luminosity @xmath66 .",
    "let us examine the following parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "since the particles are distributed by the pitch angles [ see eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) ] , for analyzing the synchrotron emission it is reasonable to estimate a mean value of @xmath31 @xmath70{a}}.\\ ] ] then one can show from eq .",
    "( [ pitch ] ) that for the aforementioned parameters the pitch angle is of the order of @xmath71 , therefore , relativistic electrons will inevitably emit photons with energies @xcite @xmath72 after substituting the value of @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) , we see that the synchrotron emission generates radiation in the mev domain .",
    "the quasi - linear diffusion works if the cyclotron modes are excited , therefore , it is essential to estimate the timescale of the corresponding instability ( @xmath74 ) and compare it with the kinematic timescale of the system .",
    "according to the work of @xcite the growth rate of the instability is given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the plasma frequency of beam electrons .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , one obtains @xmath82 , implying that the increment of the instability is given by eq .",
    "( [ inc1 ] ) .",
    "the cyclotron resonance makes sense if @xmath83 , then , by taking into account the definition of the kinematic timescale , @xmath84 and the instability timescale , @xmath85 , one can show that the aforementioned condition reduces to @xmath86 as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) , the condition is very sensitive to the lorentz factor of the plasma components , and for relatively higher values of @xmath4 the condition will violate . the upper limit of @xmath4 , when the condition is still valid is of the order of @xmath87 for @xmath57 and @xmath88 .",
    "for studying the efficiency of the qld , we examine the following set of the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath89 , @xmath79 and @xmath90 and the results are demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] where we show the behaviour of @xmath91 versus @xmath5 . from the plots",
    "is clear that @xmath91 is a continuously increasing function of the beam lorentz factor , which is a natural result of the fact that more energetic particles produce more energetic photons .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath91 versus @xmath92 is different , more dense beam electrons produce photons with lower energies .",
    "this can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ a],[pitch ] ) : @xmath93{d_{_{\\perp\\perp}}}$ ] , which by combining with @xmath94 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ dif],[ek2 ] ) ] confirms the dependence @xmath95 .",
    "according to the results demonstrated in the figure , relativistic electrons with lorentz factors @xmath96 may provide the high energy radiation in the mev - gev domain .    since the generation of the synchrotron emission strongly depends on the cyclotron waves",
    ", we also investigate the behaviour of @xmath91 versus @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the function @xmath97 for several values of @xmath92 .",
    "the set of parameters is the same as in the previous figure .",
    "as is clear from the plots , the @xmath98mev radiation is strongly connected with the submillimeter ( @xmath99\\times 10^{12}hz$ ] ) and low infrared ( @xmath100\\times 10^{12}hz$ ] ) emission .",
    "another important parameter , the physical system depends on , is the lorentz factor of the plasma component .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to demonstrate the function @xmath97 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the set of parameters is @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath101 and @xmath90 .",
    "as we see , the excited infrared domain extends up to @xmath102 , which is strongly connected with high energy emission ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "as is clear from the figure , higher values of @xmath4 correspond to lower synchrotron energies .",
    "indeed , by taking into account the relation @xmath93{d_{_{\\perp\\perp}}}$ ] combined with eqs .",
    "( [ dif],[ek2 ] ) one can see that @xmath104 .    as is clear from the results , the quasi - linear diffusion together with the cyclotron instability may guarantee production of high energy radiation in the mev - gev domains strongly connected with submillimeter / infrared emission .",
    "the major difference in results from our previous work is that in @xcite we studied physical conditions leading to excitation of @xmath1-rays connected with the relatively low frequency radio band ( khz - mhz ) , whereas in the present paper both energies ( produced as by synchrotron as by cyclotron mechanisms respectively ) are much higher .",
    "this investigation sets another problem : since the qld is a feasible mechanism providing the aforementioned high energies , one of the important next steps could be testing of mev - gev agns exhibiting an efficient submillimeter / infrared radiation and see if the strong correlation is observationally evident .",
    "this in turn , could be a certain test for estimating the agn magnetospheric parameters , such as the density and the lorentz factors of plasma component and beam electrons .",
    "a particular future objective is to investigate theoretically the radiative signatures of both high and low energy emissions respectively .",
    "this work we are going to perform sooner or later .",
    "the main aspects of the present work can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "mechanisms producing strongly connected high and low energy radiation was studied by taking into account the qld in the agn magnetospheres . considering a physical regime different from that of @xcite",
    ", we investigate the efficiency of the qld in a region close to the light cylinder surface .",
    "2 .   for the considered physical parameters",
    ", it has been shown that the cyclotron instability appears for relatively low frequency range , producing radiation in the submillimeter / infrared domains .",
    "on the other hand , despite the short cooling timescales , the effect of diffusion on particles recreates the pitch angles and produces the high energy radiation in the mev - gev bands .",
    "the problem was studied versus three major magnetospheric parameters : the beam and the plasma component s lorentz factors and the beam electrons density .",
    "it was shown that the photon energy , @xmath91 , is a continuously increasing function of the beam lorentz factor and the beam density .",
    "contrary to this , by increasing the plasma component lorentz factor , the corresponding photon energy decreases .",
