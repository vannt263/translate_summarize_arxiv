    "the molecular gases have a hierarchical structure which extends from the scale of the cloud down to much smaller masses of unbound substructures .",
    "the terminology for structure of molecular clouds is not fixed .",
    "the over - dense regions within giant molecular clouds are termed clumps .",
    "the massive clumps are parenting clouds for the clusters of proto - stellar cores .",
    "these dense cores are expected to undergo gravitational collapse evolving towards singular points and designated as proto - stars ( e.g. , stahler and palla  2004 ) . two important informations intended for the molecular cloud cores are their shapes and density - profiles .",
    "unfortunately , the core shape can not be easily concluded from the apparent observations of the - plane - of - sky because it is impossible to be directly de - projected .",
    "although , some works indicate a preference in prolate cores ( e.g. , ryden  1996 ) , but there are also some studies that favour to a strong preference in oblate cores of finite thickness ( e.g. , tassis  2007 ) .",
    "but about the density - profile in the molecular cloud cores , the observations show the systematically certain prominent common feature : a close - to - constant density over the central region ( @xmath0 ) , followed by nearly a power - law decline over large distances ( @xmath1 ) ( e.g. , hung , lai and yan  2010 ) .",
    "according to these observational results , here , we turn our attention to the molecular cloud cores with cylindrical shape and appropriate decreasing density - profile .",
    "the observational surveys of the interior of the molecular clouds have been increased enormously in the last decade , thanks to the increase of resolution provided by new millimeter and sub - millimeter interferometers , and also they are due to the systematic combination of observations of dust and molecular tracers ( e.g. , bergin and tafalla  2007 ) . in this way , many embedded condensed objects within each star - forming core have been revealed ( e.g. , pirogov and zinchenko  2008 ) which called low - mass condensations ( lmcs ) .",
    "they may be converted to the star - forming gravitationally unstable proto - stellar cores , brown dwarfs , or proto - planets .",
    "historically , we can refer to the work of langer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who observed lmcs in the core  d of taurus molecular cloud  1 in the regime of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for the recent observations , we can refer to the discovery of very low luminosity objects by the spitzer from molecular cores to planet - forming discs ( c2d ) project ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2009 ) , or the results gained by launhardt et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in which they found that at least two thirds of 32 isolated star - forming cores , which were studied there , are the evidence of forming multiple stars .",
    "clearly , these observations can also be used as a witness for existence of lmcs in the parent core before conversion to the star - forming entities .",
    "although , due to limitations in resolution and sensitivity of the available observations ( tafalla  2008 ) , our understanding about substructures within the cores is still incomplete , but this is well established that the lmcs are ubiquitous within the molecular cloud cores .",
    "the lmcs move in the parent core , thus , they may be suitable places for assembly the dusts and other molecules ; they also may be merged with each other ( e.g. , nejad - asghar  2010 ) .",
    "this topic is beyond the scope of this paper . here , we want to investigate the theoretical aspects explaining the formation of lmcs within the cores . since the molecular cloud cores are characterized by subsonic levels of internal turbulence ( e.g. myers  1983 , goodman et al .  1998 ,",
    "caselli et al .",
    "2002 ) , small rotational velocity gradients ( e.g. , goodman et al .  1993 , caselli et al .  2002 ) , and subsonic infall motions ( e.g. , tafalla et al .  1998 ,",
    "lee , myers and tafalla  2001 ) , the turbulence alone can not be responsible for the formation of lmcs .",
    "furthermore , the associated thermal pressure in the cores dominates the turbulent component by a factor of several ( e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ) . as another mechanism for formation of lmcs",
    ", we can refer to the work of van loo , falle and hartquist  ( 2007 ) who examined the effect of mhd waves on dense cores .",
    "they found that short - wavelength waves can play an important role in the generation of lmcs within a core without breaking it . here",
    ", we can encourage ourselves to authenticate the suggestion that the thermal instability ( ti ) may be a possible favorable scenario for formation of lmcs .",
    "this idea can also be supported by the probes in temperature of the molecular cores in which the observations show there may be a deviation from uniform isothermal case ( e.g. , harju et al .",
    "2008 , friesen et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "after the pioneer work of field  ( 1965 ) , there are many works on development of ti in the interstellar medium , in both numerical and analytical approaches .",
    "the main idea is that the rapid growth of ti leads to a strong density imbalance between the cold dense inhomogeneity and its low - density environment . in the molecular clouds ,",
    "gilden  ( 1984 ) calculated the cooling function to show that molecular gas may be thermally unstable in environment where @xmath4 cooling dominates .",
    "the numerical calculations of falle , ager and hartquist  ( 2006 ) give the idea that ti may have an important role in formation of internal substructures in the molecular clouds .",
    "fukue and kamaya  ( 2007 ) considered the effect of ion - neutral friction of two fluids on the growth of ti .",
    "they found the ti of the weakly ionized plasma in the magnetic field , even at the small length scales , could be grown up .",
    "nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) applied this idea for a one - dimensional self - gravitating magnetized molecular slab including the frictional heating due to ion - neutral drift .",
    "he found that the heating of ambipolar diffusion in outer regions of the slab is more significant than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions , thus , isobaric ti could take place in this area .",
    "nejad - asghar and molteni  ( 2008 ) used the two - fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate a partially ionized one - dimensional cloud .",
    "their gained results indicated that the ti can insist on the occurrence of density contrast at outer parts of the molecular cloud cores .",
    "also , the two - dimensional simulations of nejad - asghar and soltani  ( 2009 ) confirmed this idea that heating of ambipolar diffusion in the molecular cloud cores may lead to ti and formation of lmcs .    in this paper",
    ", we try to make an extension to this idea that ti may be responsible for the formation of lmcs within the molecular cloud cores . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a cylindrical contracting cloud as a background unperturbed arrange , with a power - law drop in its density - profile . in section  2",
    ", the net cooling function in the molecular clouds is calculated , and happening of ti is investigated too . in section  3 , the linear perturbation analysis with fourier decomposition of space , is applied on the contracting cylindrical core to attain the criterion of isobaric ti .",
    "the effect of thermal conduction on ti stabilization is also investigated in section  3 .",
    "finally , section  4 is devoted to a summary and conclusions .",
    "two key parameters to examine the happening of ti are the net cooling function and its time - scale .",
    "determination of the cooling rate for an optically thick , dusty molecular medium is a complex non - lte radiative transfer problem . reviewed article by dalgarno and mccray  ( 1972 )",
    "presents some of the earlier estimates of cooling rate by excitation the rotational levels of diatomic molecules . since at that time",
    ", numerous authors had discussed various aspects of this problem .",
    "for example , goldsmith and langer  ( 1978 ) analyzed in detail the cooling produced by line emission from a variety of molecular and atomic species at temperatures of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and for @xmath8 densities in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "hollenbach and mckee  ( 1979 ) evaluated the cooling of most coolant molecules by using the escape probability approximation which is equivalent to assumption of constant source function .",
    "the more comprehensive study of radiative cooling rate and emission - line luminosity in dense molecular clouds carried out by neufeld , lepp and melnick  ( 1995 ) .",
    "they considered the radiate cooling of fully shielded molecular astrophysical gas over a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath8 densities ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "goldsmith  ( 2001 ) computed the cooling effects of molecular depletion from the gas phase on grain surfaces in dark clouds .",
    "he parameterized the cooling function as @xmath12 and gave the value of parameters to different depletion runs .",
    "this equation was used by nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) to investigate the formation of fluctuations in a one - dimensional molecular cloud layer .    in this paper",
    ", we use the cooling function based on the work of neufeld , lepp and melnick  ( 1995 ) which allows us to include cooling from potentially important coolants of five molecules and two atomic species : @xmath4 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the results presented in figures @xmath18 of neufeld , lepp and melnick  ( 1995 ) are convenient to do rough parametrization like the equation ( [ cool1 ] ) , specially for temperatures between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the effects of chemistry upon the cooling rate are dramatically illustrated by the fraction of the cooling rate attributed to @xmath13 , which rises rapidly above temperature @xmath21 due to an increase in water abundance .",
    "thus , we focus our attention to the molecular clouds with temperature less than @xmath22 . for this temperature range , the values of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given in the fig .",
    "[ fitlambda ] .    as we know",
    ", the thermal process may be important if the dynamical time - scale is in excess of the cooling time - scale .",
    "we consider the contraction time - scale of a cylindrical molecular cloud as a multiple @xmath25 of the free - fall time - scale , @xmath26 where the latter is written for the spherical uniform density distribution .",
    "the cooling time - scale @xmath27 and the free - fall time - scale ( [ freetime ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ timescale ] .",
    "in fast contraction ( @xmath28 ) , ti is important in small densities ( e.g. , less than @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) , while in slow contraction ( @xmath31 ) in which the cooling time - scale is much smaller than the contraction time - scale , the importance of ti as a trigger mechanism is much evident .",
    "there are several different heating mechanisms in models of interstellar matters .",
    "since the ultraviolet photons are mostly screened out in dense molecular clouds , heating by collisional de - excitation of @xmath32 molecules after radiative excitation of lyman bands , photoemission from grains , radiative dissociation of @xmath32 , and by chemical reactions is not important .",
    "in addition , because of the small neutral hydrogen abundance , heating due to ejection of newly formed @xmath32 molecules from grain surfaces is negligible .",
    "the heating due to cosmic rays with sufficient energies ( @xmath33 ) to penetrate dense clouds is commonly about @xmath34 , with assumption of an ionization rate per @xmath32 molecule of @xmath35 and a mean energy gains per ionization of @xmath36 ( e.g. , glassgold and langer  1973 ) .",
    "following black  ( 1987 ) the turbulence dissipation heating rate can be estimated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath39 is the eddy scale . with @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we obtain @xmath42 , comparable to half of the heating rate of cosmic rays . in this way",
    ", we collect the values of these two heating rates to obtain @xmath43 .",
    "another important heating mechanism of self - gravitating contracting cloud is the heating produced by gravitational compression work .",
    "an estimation for this heating can be derived directly from the rate of compression work per particle , @xmath44 , and is given by @xmath45 where we have taken @xmath46 appropriate for a uniform contracting spherical cloud with contraction time - scale @xmath47 where @xmath31 is for slow contraction , and @xmath28 is for fast one ( i.e. , free - fall case ) .    the dissipation of magnetic energy would be considered as another heating mechanism , if this energy is not simply radiated away by atoms , molecules , and grains .",
    "the major field dissipation mechanism in the dense clouds is almost certainly ambipolar diffusion , which was examined by scalo  ( 1977 ) for density dependency of magnetic field in a fragmenting molecular cloud .",
    "padoan , zweibel and nordlund  ( 2000 ) presented calculations of frictional heating by ion - neutral drift in three - dimensional simulations of turbulent , magnetized molecular clouds .",
    "they show that average value of ambipolar drift heating rate can be significantly larger than the average of cosmic - ray heating rate .",
    "in addition , nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) considered a molecular slab under the assumption of quasi - magnetohydrostatic equilibrium , concluded that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value in some regions of the slab can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and the dissipating turbulent motions . to gain an insight on the heating rate of ion - neutral friction , we assume that the pressure and gravitational force on the charged fluid component are insignificant compared to the lorentz force because of low ionization fraction , thus , the drift velocity @xmath48 is inversely proportional to the density and directly proportional to the gradient of magnetic pressure ( see equation  [ [ drift ] ] below ) . here",
    "we choose , in a general form , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the change of magnetic pressure in length - scale @xmath51 , and the value of @xmath52 may be approximated near @xmath53 ( this value is from the assumption of ionization equilibrium with the ion density being power law of the neutral density with power @xmath54 ) .",
    "nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) adopted the value of @xmath52 in the range between @xmath55 and @xmath56 to examine the isobaric ti in the regions of a self - gravitating molecular slab .",
    "the heating due to ambipolar diffusion is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the drag force per unit volume exerted on the neutrals by ions , @xmath59 is the collision drag in molecular clouds , and we used the relation @xmath60 between ion and neutral densities in ionization equilibrium state with @xmath61 ( shu  1992 ) . substituting the appropriate values for typical molecular cloud cores ,",
    "the ambipolar diffusion heating rate is as follows @xmath62 where the general form @xmath63 is used according to equation ( [ drift ] ) below . the total heating and cooling rates of a magnetized slow contracting molecular cloud core with typical value @xmath64 are shown in fig .  [ coolheat ] for different values of parameters @xmath52 , @xmath65 and temperature @xmath66 .",
    "now , we can turn our attention to the occurrence of ti in the molecular clouds .",
    "the standard criterion applicable to the interstellar gas , in the isobaric instability condition , can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the net cooling function , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are evaluated in equilibrium state ( see , e.g. , the review by balbus  1995 ) .",
    "when the density along the net cooling curve increases so that a density fluctuation is formed , the above criterion states it will tend to be amplified because the mentioned fluctuation has a larger cooling than its heating rate , thus , the surrounding gas will compress it further .",
    "[ coolheat ] suggests that without heating of ambipolar diffusion , there would not be any ti while with it , the instability criterion ( [ critins ] ) can worthily be satisfied specially in attenuated region of a molecular cloud .",
    "furthermore , this scenario can also be shown by the pressure - density plane which is an elegant method to describe the isobaric instability modes in thermal equilibrium . in this method ,",
    "an equilibrium state is specified by the intersection of a thermal equilibrium curve and a constant pressure line . in this way",
    ", any perturbation from equilibrium state leads to split the gas in two phases , as the individual gas element transfer into related phase in correspondence with its initial sign of fluctuation ( i.e. , density increase or density decrease ) .",
    "pressure - density diagram of thermal equilibrium and instability criterion are depicted in fig .",
    "[ equilib ] .",
    "this figure shows that including the heating rate due to ambipolar diffusion can produce a two - phase medium in outer regions ( low density ) of a typical molecular cloud core .",
    "for investigation the importance of ti in outer region of a molecular cloud core , a long axisymmetric cylindrical geometry is assumed to extend in @xmath71-direction with an axial magnetic field @xmath72 , which directly coupled only to the charged particles .",
    "principally , the ion velocity @xmath73 and the neutral velocity @xmath74 in the molecular clouds , should be determined by solving separate fluid equations of these species , include their coupling by collision processes . however , in the time - scale considered here ( see , fig .",
    "[ timescale ] ) , two fluids of ion and neutral are approximately coupled together with a drift velocity given by @xmath75 which is obtained by assuming that the pressure and gravitational forces on the charged fluid component are negligible compared to the lorentz force because of the low ionization fraction . here ,",
    "in a good approximation we choose @xmath76 . in this way",
    ", we can use the basic equations as were given by shu  ( 1992 ) : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the thermal conduction coefficient in molecular clouds ( lang   1986 ) , and other variables and parameters have their usual meanings . the energy equation ( [ ebenerg ] ) contains a source term @xmath83 , which describes the work is done by expansion or contraction of the medium .",
    "thus , we note that the self - gravitating heating term ( [ heargr ] ) must be excluded from the net cooling function @xmath84 .",
    "the time evolution of magnetic field itself may then be obtained from the approximation that it freezes only in the plasma of ions and electrons . in this way",
    ", we obtain a nonlinear diffusion equation as follows @xmath85 if the right - hand side of the magnetic induction equation ( [ ebmag ] ) is negligible , the field is well coupled to the whole fluid .    as a basis for small - perturbation analysis",
    ", we consider an axisymmetric cylindrical background that is contracting in a quasi - hydrostatic balance between the self - gravity and the repulsive forces ( i.e. , thermal and magnetic pressure forces ) .",
    "the background quantities will be denoted with the subscript `` 0 '' .",

    "in which @xmath103 is equal to @xmath99 , the minimum value of @xmath88 takes place , thus the maximum effect of this contraction is an approximately tenfold over density in its profile .      for obtaining a linearized system of equations",
    ", we split each variable into unperturbed and perturbed components , the latter is indicated by subscript `` 1 '' .",
    "then , we carry out a spatial fourier analysis with components proportional to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the component of perturbation wave - vector perpendicular to the magnetic field . simplifying the linearized equations ( [ drift])-([ebstate ] ) by repeated use of the unperturbed background equations ( [ backgden])-([st ] )",

    "in fact , the net cooling function @xmath84 in equation ( [ lineng ] ) must contain also the ambipolar heating due to perturbed magnetic field .",
    "however , because we have expressed the ambipolar heating in equation ( [ heatad ] ) by parameters , in numerical calculations for drawing figures , we can involve this effect by the amount of parameters .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we neglect the explicit calculations of the changes of ambipolar heating due to perturbed drift velocity .",
    "since the equilibrium is time dependent , the normal modes of the system are time dependent too , thus , we must apply some approximation techniques namely wkb approximation ( e.g. , bora and baruah  2008 ) to gain valuable insight into the nature of problem ; this analysis may be a challenging task in a subsequent research . here",
    ", we consider the isobaric ti , which is more realistic phenomena in the interstellar gases . gathering the equations ( [ linsta ] ) and ( [ lineng ] ) with equation ( [ linden ] ) , in isobaric case ( @xmath112 ) , leads to an exponential growth as follows @xmath113},\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is a complex function with real and imaginary components given by @xmath115= \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s } + \\frac{1+\\frac{3}{2 }      \\frac{5}{2 } k^2 r^2 } { 1 + ( \\frac{5}{2})^2 k^2 r^2 } \\left ( k_t - k_\\rho      + \\frac{k^2}{k_k}\\right)c_0,\\ ] ] and @xmath116= \\frac{\\dot{s}}{s } kr + \\frac{k r } { 1 + ( \\frac{5}{2})^2 k^2 r^2 } \\left ( k_t - k_\\rho      + \\frac{k^2}{k_k}\\right)c_0,\\ ] ] respectively , where the notation of the pioneer work of field  ( 1965 ) is used as follows @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the speed of sound in the unperturbed medium .",
    "the field s isobaric instability criterion ( @xmath119 ) can be clearly revived via the equation ( [ realomg ] ) by considering a stationary cloud ( @xmath120 ) .    manipulating the equation  ( [ realomg ] )",
    "leads to the isobaric ti criterion in a contracting axisymmetric cylindrical cloud core as follows @xmath121 where @xmath122 where the @xmath123 and @xmath124 are explicitly evaluated , using the background equations ( [ backgden])-([st ] ) , and @xmath125 is the thermal conduction coefficient in the axis of the cylinder .",
    "there are three notable remarks for @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the equation ( [ inscriter ] ) : ( )  since @xmath123 has a positive value and @xmath124 has a negative value , their effects on instability criterion are reciprocal .",
    "several studies have demonstrated that thermal conduction can stabilize and even erase a density perturbation ( e.g. , burkert and lin 2000 ) .",
    "this implies that in the opposite of thermal conduction , the contraction can fortify ti because the energy is transported inward by the contraction process .",
    "( )  during the growth of density perturbations in isobaric regime , the resulting temperature gradient induces the conductive heating in fluctuations .",
    "the temperature gradient is greater at the distant region of the axis because in isobaric perturbation ( @xmath126 ) , @xmath127 is a decreasing function of the axial radius @xmath86 .",

    "perturbations with wavelengths between @xmath149 and @xmath150 are partially affected by thermal conduction while perturbations with wavelengths less than @xmath150 will entirely be suppressed .",
    "for @xmath151 we used the maximum allowed @xmath86 in the unstable region and for @xmath152 its minimum was used .",
    "these choices are because of obtaining the minimum value of wavelength for @xmath150 and the maximum value of it for @xmath149 .",

    "investigation of the net cooling rate in the molecular clouds shows that the consideration of the heating due to ion - neutral drift can lead to the thermally unstable gas ( figs .",

    "another remark is that the formation of condensations via isobaric ti may in general be suppressed by the thermal conduction process as long as it overcomes on the contraction effect .",

    "the medium would be stabilized by consideration of thermal conduction which its significance depends on perturbation wavelength ( fig .",

    "the thermal conduction can entirely suppress the instability of perturbations with wavelengths less than @xmath155 , while its effect is completely ignorable at wavelengths greater than @xmath156 .",
    "thus , lmcs more massive than @xmath157 can grow via ti without being undergone the thermal conduction , and those smaller than @xmath158 are completely disrupted by the thermal conduction process ( @xmath159 is chosen approximately @xmath160 where ti occurs ) . perturbations with having wavelengths between @xmath149 and @xmath150",

    "although , the ti may justify the formation of lmcs more massive than @xmath165 , however , the puzzle is highly incomplete .",
    "we might investigate the behavior and evolution of these lmcs because they move and accumulate ubiquitous dust and other molecules .",
