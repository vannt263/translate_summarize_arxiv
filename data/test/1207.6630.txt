    "the network - layer performance analysis seeks to provide estimates on the delays experienced by traffic traversing the elements of a network , as well as the corresponding buffer requirements . for wireless networks ,",
    "a question of interest is how the stochastic properties of wireless channels impact delay and backlog performance . wireless channels",
    "are characterized by rapid variation of channel quality caused by the mobility and location of communicating devices .",
    "this is due to _ fading _ , which is the deviation in the attenuation experienced by the transmitted signal when traversing a wireless channel . the term _ fading channel _ is used to refer to a channel that experiences such effects . in this paper we explore the network - layer performance of a multi - hop network where each link is represented by a fading channel .",
    "we model the wireless network by tandem queues with variable capacity servers , where each server expresses the random capacity of a fading channel .",
    "we ignore the impact of coding by assuming that transmission rates over the fading channels are equal to their information - theoretic capacity limit , @xmath0 , which is expressed as a function of the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver , @xmath1 , by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the channel bandwidth ( in _ hz _ ) .",
    "numerous models are available to describe the gain of fading channels depending on the type of fading ( slow or fast ) , and the environment ( e.g. , urban or rural ) .",
    "the instantaneous , information - theoretic channel capacity of a fading channel can be represented as the logarithm of @xmath1 by ( see chp .  14.2 in @xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant and the function @xmath6 is used to characterize the fading channel .",
    "we are interested in finding bounds on the end - to - end delay and on buffer requirements for a cascade of fading channels , with store - and - forward processing at each channel .",
    "the analysis in this paper takes a system - theoretic stochastic network calculus approach @xcite , which describes the network properties using a @xmath7 dioid algebra .",
    "arrival and departure processes at a network element are described by bivariate stochastic processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , denoting the cumulative arrivals ( departures ) in the time interval @xmath10 .",
    "a network element is characterized by the service process @xmath11 , denoting the available service in @xmath10 .",
    "the input - output relationship at the network element is governed by @xmath12 where the convolution operator ` @xmath13 ' is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "if network traffic passes through a tandem of @xmath15 network elements with service processes @xmath16 , the service of the network as a whole can be expressed by the convolution @xmath17 .",
    "the stochastic properties of fading channels present a formidable challenge for a network - layer analysis since the service processes corresponding to the channel capacity of common fading channel models such as rician , rayleigh , or nakagami-@xmath18 , require to take a logarithm of their distributions .",
    "as discussed in the next section , researchers frequently turn to higher - layer abstractions to model fading channels .",
    "widely used abstraction are the two - state gilbert - elliott model and its extensions to finite - state markov channels ( fsmc ) @xcite .",
    "fsmc models simplify the analysis to a degree that the network model becomes tractable , at least at a single node .",
    "extensions to multi - hop settings encounter a rapidly growing state space . as of today , a general multihop analysis that is applicable to models of fading channels , such as rician , rayleigh , or nakagami-@xmath18 , remains open .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue a novel approach to the analysis of multi - hop wireless networks .",
    "we develop a calculus for wireless networks that can be applied to fading channel models from the wireless communication literature to provide network - layer performance bounds .",
    "we view the network - layer model with arrival , departure and service processes as residing in a _ bit domain _ , where traffic and service is measured in bits .",
    "we view the fading channel models used in wireless communications as residing in an alternate domain , which we call the _ snr domain _ , where channel properties are expressed in terms of the distribution of the signal - to - noise ratio at the receiver .",
    "we then derive a method to compute performance bounds from these traffic and service characterizations .",
    "a key observation in our work is that service elements in the snr domain obey the laws of a dioid algebra .",
    "we devise a suitable dioid , referred to as _  algebra _ , where the minimum takes the role of the standard addition , and the second operation is the usual multiplication , and use it for analysis in the snr domain . in this domain",
    "multi - hop descriptions of fading channels become tractable . in particular , we find that a cascade of fading channels can be expressed in terms of a convolution in the new algebra of the constituting channels .",
    "the key to our analysis is that we derive performance bounds entirely in the snr domain . observing that the bit and snr domains are linked by the exponential function , we transfer arrival and departure processes from the bit to the snr domain .",
    "then , we derive backlog and delay bounds in the transfer domain using the  algebra .",
    "the results are mapped back to the original bit domain to finally give us the desired performance bounds .",
    "our derivations in the snr domain require the computation of products and quotients of random variables . here , we take advantage of the _ mellin transform _ to facilitate otherwise cumbersome calculations . then , the computational problem is reduced to finding the mellin transform for service and traffic processes .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the development of a framework for studying the impact of channel gain models on the network - layer performance of wireless networks . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "the snr domain is used solely as a transfer domain that enables us to solve an otherwise intractable mathematical problem . on the other hand",
    ", the ability to map quantities that appear in network - layer models and concepts found in a physical - layer analysis may prove useful in a broader context , e.g. , for studying cross - layer performance issues in wireless communications .",
    "moreover , the  algebra and the mellin transform form a tool set that can be applied more generally in wireless communications for studying the channel gain of cascades of fading channels .",
    "as the first paper on the  network calculus algebra , our paper only considers simple network scenarios and makes numerous convenient assumptions ( which are made explicit in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "there is room for significant future work on extensions of the model and a relaxation of the presented assumptions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : related ] we discuss related work . we describe the system model in sec .  [ sec : model ] , where we also motivate the use of the snr domain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculus ] we present the  algebra and derive performance bounds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rayleigh ] we apply the analysis to a cascade of rayleigh channels , and present numerical examples . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rayleigh ] , we investigate a network with cross traffic at each node .",
    "we discuss brief conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "analytical approaches for network - layer performance analysis of wireless networks include queueing theory , effective bandwidth and , more recently , network calculus .",
    "since the service processes corresponding to the channel capacity of common fading channel models such as rician , rayleigh , or nakagami-@xmath18 , require to take a logarithm of their distributions , researchers often turn to higher - layer abstractions to model fading channels , which lend themselves more easily to an analysis .",
    "a widely used abstraction is the two - state channel model developed by gilbert @xcite and elliott @xcite , and subsequent extensions to a finite - state markov channel ( fsmc ) @xcite .",
    "markov channel models are well suited to express the time correlation of fading channel samples .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey of the development and applications of fsmc models .",
    "zorzi et al .",
    "@xcite evaluated the accuracy of first - order markov channel models of fading channels , where the next channel sample depends only on the current state of the markov process , and higher order processes that can capture memory extending further back in the process history .",
    "the authors found that a first - order markov model is a good approximation of the fading channel , and that using higher order markov processes does not significantly improve the accuracy of the model .",
    "queue - based channel ( qbc ) @xcite is an alternative model for fading channels , which models a binary additive noise channel with memory based on a finite queue . here , a queue with size @xmath19 contains the last @xmath19 noise symbols , and the noise process is an @xmath20-order markov chain .",
    "the model was found to provide a better approximation to the rayleigh and rician slow fading channels compared to the gilbert - elliot model @xcite .",
    "an extension of the qbc model , called weighted qbc @xcite permit queue cells ( i.e. , channel samples ) to contribute with different weights to the noise process .",
    "queueing theoretic studies of fading channels generally apply approximations to reduce the complexity of multi - hop models .",
    "le , nguyen , and hossain @xcite apply a decomposition approximation to analyze the loss probability and average delay of a multi - hop wireless network with slotted transmissions for a batch bernoulli arrival process , and with independent cross traffic at each node .",
    "the wireless link is assumed to employ adaptive modulation and coding with multiple modes , where each mode corresponds to a given link rate , which is chosen based on the snr of the channel .",
    "the channel state of a link is assumed to be stationary , and channel states in consecutive time slots are independent .",
    "another decomposition approximation is presented by le and hossain @xcite , who consider a multi - hop tandem network with a batch arrival process and multi - rate transmissions , to develop a routing scheme that can meet given delay and loss requirements .",
    "the analysis obtains end - to - end loss rates and delays with a decomposition analysis , and feeds the results as metrics to the routing algorithm .",
    "bisnik and abouzeid @xcite model a multi - hop wireless network as an open network of g / g/1 queueing systems .",
    "using diffusion approximation , they obtain closed - form expressions for average end - to - end delays .",
    "ishizaki and hwang @xcite studied the impact of multiuser diversity assisted packet scheduling on the packet delay performance in a wireless network with nakagami - m fading channels .",
    "the network is modeled by a multi - queue system , where each channel is described by an fsmc . under assumptions of stationarity , homogeneity , and independence of the channel processes , they approximate the tail distribution of packet delays , and compare it to that of a round - robin scheduler .",
    "the results indicate that the delay performance of multiuser diversity assisted scheduling algorithms is not necessarily superior to that of round - robin scheduling .",
    "since the application of queuing theoretical methods to study cascade of fading channels requires many assumptions on arrival and service distributions , and simplifications of the model , the use of classical queueing theoretic methods for the performance analysis of multi - hop wireless networks has been put into question @xcite .",
    "an effective bandwidth @xcite analysis seeks to develop ( asymptotic ) bounds on performance metrics , e.g. , an exponential decay of the backlog .",
    "wu and negi @xcite have adapted an effective bandwidth analysis to the analysis of fading channels .",
    "they introduce the concept of effective capacity , which characterizes a wireless channel by a log - moment generating function ( log - mgf ) of the channel capacity .",
    "they obtain an asymptotic approximation of the delay bound violation probability of a rayleigh fading channel . due to the difficulty of computing the moment generating function ( mgf ) of the rayleigh distribution , they assume non - correlated distributions with low snr and estimate channel parameters from measurements .",
    "the work has been extended to correlated rayleigh and correlated nakagami-@xmath18 channels , and to cascades of fading channels @xcite .",
    "a closely related concept is the effective channel capacity presented by li et al .",
    "@xcite , which describes the available channel capacity by a first order markov chain and computes the log - mgf of the underlying markov process . taking advantage of methods developed in @xcite ,",
    "they compute statistical delay bounds for nakagami - m fading channel .",
    "hassan , krunz , and matta @xcite use an effective bandwidth analysis to study delay and loss performance at a single wireless link , which is modeled by an fsmc . for fluid on - off traffic and fifo buffering ,",
    "they obtain a closed form expression for the effective bandwidth required to guarantee bounds on delay and packet loss .",
    "there is a collection of recent works that apply stochastic network calculus methods @xcite to wireless networks with fading channels . the stochastic network calculus is closely related to the effective bandwidth theory , in that it seeks to develop bounds on performance metrics under assumptions also found in the effective bandwidth literature .",
    "different from effective bandwidth literature , stochastic network calculus methods seek to develop non - asymptotic bounds .",
    "an attractive element of a network calculus analysis is that sometimes it is possible to extend a single node analysis to a tandem of nodes , using the convolution operation seen in the introduction .",
    "fidler @xcite presents a network calculus methodology for a two - state fsmc model of a single - hop fading channel .",
    "he applies the mgf network calculus , which was suggested in the problem sets of chapter  7 in @xcite , and which has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the mgf network calculus takes its name from the extensive use of moment generating functions in the derivation of performance bounds .",
    "mahmood , rizk , and jiang @xcite apply the mgf network calculus to mimo channels and derive delay bounds for periodic traffic sources .",
    "@xcite also use an mgf network calculus to study the performance of two - hop relay networks .",
    "a similar methodology is applied by mahmod , vehkaper , and jiang @xcite to compute the throughput of a multi - user ds - cdma system with delay constraints . in the works above that apply the mgf network calculus , models for a cascade of multiple fading channels become complex , so that multi - node results for networks with more than two nodes have not been obtained .",
    "the  network calculus developed in this paper uses similar descriptions and assumptions for traffic and service as the mgf network calculus . by performing computations in a transfer domain , where fading channel models take a simpler form , we are able to compute multi - node service descriptions for an arbitrarily large number of nodes .",
    "the mgf network calculus assumes that arrivals and service at each node are independent .",
    "these assumptions can be relaxed using statistical envelope descriptions for traffic ( effective envelopes ) and service ( statistical service curve ) @xcite .",
    "jiang and emstad @xcite have applied an approach with envelopes to a fading channel where the wireless channel is characterized by two stochastic processes : an ideal service process and an impairment process , where the impairment process captures effects due to fading , noise , and cross traffic .",
    "verticale and giacomazzi @xcite obtain a closed form expression for the variance of a service curve , which describes the available service by a markov chain .",
    "this is used for the analysis of an fsmc model of a rayleigh fading channel . for computing the bounds for markovian arrivals , they apply the bounded - variance network calculus introduced in @xcite , which is an extension of the central limit theorem methods by choe and shroff @xcite to multi - hop paths .",
    "verticale @xcite has applied the same methodology to constant bit rate traffic .",
    "ciucu , pan , and hohlfeld @xcite and ciucu @xcite present non - asymptotic ( i.e. , finite number of hops ) , closed - form expressions for the delay and throughput distributions for multi - hop wireless networks .",
    "as many of the works discussed above , the fading channel is modeled by an abstraction that uses a link layer model of the transmission channel . here , the channel is assumed to be governed by a slotted - aloha system in half - duplex mode .",
    "the model of this channel is a two - state on - off server , where a node can transmit ( i.e. , is in the on state ) only when other all nodes in the interference range are not transmitting .",
    "there is also a literature on physical - layer performance metrics of fading channels in multi - hop wireless networks .",
    "hasna and alouini @xcite have presented a framework for evaluating the end - to - end outage probability of a multi - hop wireless relay network with independent , non - regenerative relays , i.e. , amplify - and - forward ( af ) , over nakagami fading channels .",
    "they provide a closed - form expression for the mgf of the reciprocal of the equivalent end - to - end snr for independent nakagami fading channels .",
    "for the same af relay network , tsiftsis @xcite obtains a closed - form bound for the average error probability . this bound is reportedly tight at low snr , but may become loose for higher snr values and for more severe fading environment , e.g. , rayleigh fading .",
    "amarasuriya , tellambura , and ardakani @xcite present an alternative bound to @xcite on the end - to - end snr in multi - hop af relay networks .",
    "they derive the distribution function and the mgf for i.i.d .",
    "nakagami - m fading and for independent , but non - identically distributed rayleigh fading .",
    "the works above study physical layer performance bounds of channel - assisted , amplify - and - forward relaying over a multi - hop fading channels .",
    "they do not consider buffering or traffic burstiness , and are not concerned with network performance metrics addressed in this paper . delay and backlog analysis and optimization of multihop wireless networks remains an open research problem @xcite .",
    "we consider a wireless @xmath15-node tandem network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tandem ] , where each node is modeled by a server with an infinite buffer .",
    "we are interested in the performance experienced by a ( through ) flow that traverses the entire network and may encounter cross traffic at each node .",
    "one can think of the cross traffic at a node as the aggregate of all traffic traversing the node that does not belong to the through flow . the service given to the through flow at a node",
    "is a random process , which is governed by the instantaneous channel capacity as well as the cross traffic at the node .",
    "we consider a fluid - flow traffic model where the flow is infinitely divisible .",
    "we will work in a discrete - time domain @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the set of integers and @xmath23 is length of the time unit .",
    "setting @xmath24 allows us to replace @xmath25 by @xmath26 , which we interpret as the index of a time slot .",
    "we assume that the system is started with empty queues at time @xmath27 .",
    "different nodes and different traffic flows will be distinguished by subscripts .",
    "the cumulative arrivals to , the service offered by , and the departures from the node are represented by random processes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 that will be described more precisely below , with @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 and @xmath34 the arrivals to and the departures from the tandem network . throughout , we assume that arrival and service processes satisfy stationary bounds .",
    "consider for the moment a single node .",
    "dropping subscripts , we write @xmath35 for the cumulative arrivals and departures , respectively , at the node in the time interval @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the arrivals and @xmath38 the departures in the @xmath26-th time slot . due to causality",
    ", we have @xmath39 .",
    "the processes lie in the set @xmath40 of non - negative bivariate functions @xmath41 that are increasing in the second argument and vanish unless @xmath42 .",
    "the backlog at time @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 and the delay at the node is given by @xmath45    the service of the node in the time interval @xmath36 is given by a random process @xmath46 , such that eq .",
    "holds for every arrival process @xmath47 and the corresponding departure process @xmath48 . this service description with bivariate functions",
    "is referred to as _",
    "dynamic server_. initially defined for non - random service  @xcite , dynamic servers have been extended to random processes in @xcite .",
    "the above model is a typical network - layer model . where traffic is measured in bits , and service is measured in bits per second .",
    "we thus refer to this model of arrivals , departures , and service as residing in a _",
    "bit domain_.    the network calculus exploits that networks which satisfy the input - output relation of eq .   with equality",
    "can be viewed as linear systems in a dioid algebra @xcite . in the ( @xmath49 ) dioid ,",
    "the minimum and addition take the place of the standard addition and multiplication operations .",
    "the network calculus is based on the fact that @xmath50 is again a dioid  @xcite .",
    "note that the min - plus convolution , which provides the second operation in the dioid , is not commutative in @xmath40 .      to compute a service model for a wireless channel , we assume that the channel state information is sampled at equal time intervals @xmath23 . with @xmath51 ,",
    "let @xmath52 denote the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio observed at the receiver in the @xmath26-th sampling epoch .",
    "then , @xmath52 is a nonnegative random variable that has the probability distribution of the underlying fading model .",
    "we assume that the random variables @xmath52 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "this assumption is justified when @xmath23 is longer than the channel coherence time .",
    "otherwise , the assumption will give optimistic bounds .",
    "we emphasize that the network calculus in this paper applies to settings without independence , however , the derivation of performance bounds will proceed differently . using eq .",
    ", the instantaneous service offered by the channel in the @xmath26-th slot is given by @xmath53 . and",
    "the corresponding service process is given by @xmath54 where we haven chosen units such that the constant in eq .",
    "takes the value @xmath55 .    the service description in eq .",
    "requires us to work with the logarithm of fading distributions , which presents a non - trivial technical difficulty via the usual network calculus or queueing theory . on the other hand , observe that the exponential @xmath56 is described more simply by @xmath57 this motivates the development of a system model that allows us to exploit the more tractable service representation in eq .  .",
    "in this alternative model , arrivals , departures , and service reside in a different domain , where we can work directly with the distribution functions of the fading channel gain and the corresponding snr at the receiver .",
    "we now proceed by mapping the network model from fig .",
    "[ fig : tandem ] into a transfer domain , which we refer to as _ snr domain_.",
    "we will seek to derive performance bounds in the transfer domain , and then map the results to the bit domain to obtain network - layer bounds for backlog and delays .",
    "the relationship of the network models in bit domain and snr domain is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] .    in the previous subsection",
    ", we constructed the service process for a wireless link in the snr domain in eq .",
    "as @xmath58 by analogy , we describe the arrivals and departures in the snr domain by @xmath59 throughout this paper , we use calligraphic upper - case letters to represent processes that characterize traffic or service as a function of the instantaneous snr in the sense of eq .  .",
    "due to the monotonicity of the exponential function , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are increasing in @xmath62 , and satisfy the causality property @xmath63 .",
    "the backlog process is accordingly described by @xmath64 since time is not affected by this transformation , the delay is given by @xmath65 to interpret these processes in the transfer domain , let @xmath66 be the instantaneous channel snr required to transmit @xmath37 in a single time slot , assuming transmission at the rate of the capacity limit .",
    "the arrival process in the snr domain can then be expressed in terms of these variables as @xmath67 here , we are treating channel quality expressed in terms of the instantaneous snr as a commodity .",
    "an arrival in a time unit represents a workload , where @xmath68 expresses the amount of resources that will be consumed by the workload .",
    "the backlog can similarly be expressed in terms of the instantaneous snr as @xmath69 with the interpretation that a node with backlog @xmath70 at time @xmath62 requires full use of the channel capacity for @xmath71 time units to clear the backlog .",
    "most importantly , the concept of the dynamic server translates to the snr domain . in a network system ,",
    "the service process in the bit domain satisfies eq .",
    "if and only if the process @xmath72 in the snr domain satisfies @xmath73 we refer to a network element that satisfies eq .   for any sample path as _ dynamic snr server_. in this general setting",
    ", we not require that @xmath74 takes the form in eq .",
    ", in particular , @xmath75 does not be equal to @xmath76 .",
    "traffic aggregation in the snr domain is expressed in terms of a product .",
    "when @xmath19 flows have arrivals at a node with arrival processes denoted by @xmath77 , then the total arrival , @xmath78 , are given for any @xmath79 by @xmath80 if we let @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the corresponding processes in the snr domain , we see that @xmath83    with the above definitions , the usual network description by a dioid algebra in the bit domain can be expressed in the snr domain by a dioid algebra on @xmath40 where the second operator is a multiplication .",
