    "here , we address a fundamental question of how the specific energy of phaseonium fuel is scaled with the number of quantum coherent levels .",
    "a favorable scaling law against decoherence and dephasing could bring the phaseonium engine closer to available practical systems .",

    "coherence can be characterized by the magnitude and phase of the complex number @xmath10 .",
    "though both the amplitude and the phase of coherent superposition states can be controlled in experiments @xcite , the main control variable for the photonic carnot engine is the phase of the coherence as the amplitude is required to be small enough to keep the system only slightly out of thermal equilibrium .",

    "<S> we investigate scaling of work and efficiency of a photonic carnot engine with the number of quantum coherent resources . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider a generalization of the `` phaseonium fuel '' for the photonic carnot engine , which was first introduced as a three - level atom with two lower states in a quantum coherent superposition by [ m. o. scully , m. suhail zubairy , g. s. agarwal , and h. walther , science * 299 * , 862 ( 2003 ) ] , to the case of @xmath0 level atoms with @xmath1 coherent lower levels . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account atomic relaxation and dephasing as well as the cavity loss and derive a coarse grained master equation to evaluate the work and efficiency , analytically . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are verified by microscopic numerical examination of the thermalization dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that efficiency and work scale quadratically with the number of quantum coherent levels . </S>",
    "<S> quantum coherence boost to the specific energy ( work output per unit mass of the resource ) is a profound fundamental difference of quantum fuel from classical resources . </S>",
    "<S> we consider typical modern resonator set ups and conclude that multilevel phaseonium fuel can be utilized to overcome the decoherence in available systems . </S>",
    "<S> preparation of the atomic coherences and the associated cost of coherence are analyzed and the engine operation within the bounds of the second law is verified . </S>",
    "<S> our results bring the photonic carnot engines much closer to the capabilities of current resonator technologies . </S>"
