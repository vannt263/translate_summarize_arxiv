    "in general relativity , a black hole may be formed during the evolution from asymptotically flat initial data where none is present .",

    "it is not difficult to find such families which form a black hole for some range of the parameter ( strong data ) but disperse for another range ( weak data ) .",
    "the boundary between the two regimes is the black hole threshold . in what is called type ii critical collapse ,",
    "the black hole mass can be made arbitrarily small by adjusting the parameter @xmath0 of the initial data to its critical value @xmath1 .",

    "this means that it must have precisely one unstable linear perturbation , with the property that adding a bit of that perturbation with one sign leads to collapse , while adding it with the opposite sign leads to dispersion . in type ii critical collapse",
    "the critical point is either a discretely self - similar ( dss ) or a continuously self - similar ( css ) spacetime .",
    "type ii critical collapse is interesting , among other things , because the maximum value of the curvature in a subcritical evolution , and the maximal value of the curvature outside the black hole in a supercritical evolution , both diverge as @xmath6 as the fine - tuning is improved .",
    "( this is basically the same result as the black hole mass scaling , and similar results hold for any curvature invariant . ) from the dynamical systems picture it is clear that the end point of type ii critical collapse in the limit of perfect tuning of @xmath0 to its critical value @xmath1 is not a `` zero mass black hole '' but the critical solution itself .",

    "the choptuik spacetime is an attractor on the critical surface and therefore , assuming that it is actually a global attractor on the surface , we can conclude that every naked singularity will have , at least in a neighborhood of the singularity , the structure of the choptuik spacetime .",
    "we can now summarize this structure as follows : the curvature at the cauchy horizon of the singularity is finite but not differentiable , with an infinite number of damped oscillations piling up as the cauchy horizon is approached . the continuation of the spacetime beyond the cauchy horizon is not unique , but we have shown that if it is dss then the naked singularity is either a single point or timelike with infinite negative mass .",
