    "monte carlo studies of classical and quantum many - body systems with long - range interactions are limited by time - consuming summations over the interacting particle pairs , the number of which grows quadratically with the system size .",
    "many important problems in both basic and applied science can be mapped onto long - range interacting spin models , and hence it would be desirable to develop more efficient numerical techniques for tackling them . for classical ising models ,",
    "considerable progress has indeed been made on algorithms scaling almost linearly with the system size @xcite . in the context of simulated annealing @xcite , where the ground state of a classical system ( typically with complicated interactions ) is obtained through a simulation where",
    "the temperature is slowly lowered to zero , it has been suggested @xcite that a more rapid convergence could be achieved by using a quantum model , e.g. , the ising model in a transverse ( spin flipping ) field . even in an imaginary - time path - integral formulation , the quantum fluctuations can , at least in some cases @xcite , relax the system towards its classical ground state more rapidly than thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is a strong motivation for developing more efficient simulation methods for quantum ising models .",
    "another important reason is the continued prominence of the transverse ising model in the theory of magnetism , particularly in the context of quantum phase transitions @xcite . whereas transverse ising models with short - range interactions have recently been actively studied using quantum monte carlo methods @xcite , numerical work on long - range models has so far been limited to special cases @xcite . in some of the best experimental realizations of the transverse ising model the interactions are in fact long - ranged @xcite .    here",
    "a stochastic series expansion ( sse ) @xcite algorithm for transverse ising models with long - range interactions is introduced in which the direct summation over the interacting spins is avoided .",
    "the computation time scales with the system size n as @xmath2 times the spatial integral of the absolute value of the interaction [ which normally converges as @xmath4 , or diverges only as @xmath5 . both local and cluster - type updates are developed for the transverse ising model with arbitrary interactions .",
    "the cluster update is a generalization of the classical swendsen - wang cluster method @xcite to the transverse ising model , and shares some features with a scheme previously used within the continuous - time world - line algorithm @xcite .",
    "the way to treat the long - range interactions generalizes the scheme developed for the classical ising model by luijten and blte @xcite .",
    "the integration of these features in the sse formalism should open new opportunities for detailed numerical studies of a wide range of important models .",

    "the sse method @xcite is an efficient alternative to worldline quantum monte carlo @xcite .",
    "it is based on a generalization of the power - series scheme for the heisenberg ferromagnet that was developed by handscomb in the early 1960 s @xcite .",
    "handscomb s method was later extended to some other models @xcite , but the requirement of analytically calculable traces of the terms of the expansion inhibited further progress . in the sse method , a basis is instead chosen , and the traces are also evaluated stochastically , in combination with the sampling of the operator products in the series expansion of @xmath6 .",
    "this starting point for quantum monte carlo is as generally applicable as the worldline ( imaginary - time path - integral ) approach .",
    "recently , loop - type cluster updates @xcite have been developed and generalized for efficient sse simulations of a wide range of models @xcite .",
    "however , since the loop updates rely heavily on the presence of off - diagonal pair ( or multi - particle ) interactions , they can not be directly adapted to the transverse ising model in the standard basis where the ising term is diagonal . in the basis where the field is diagonal ,",
    "loop updates can be easily implemented @xcite but then sign problems @xcite appear when the interaction is frustrated . here",
    "the sse method is applied to an arbitrary transverse ising model , i.e. , with no limitations on the sign and range of the spin - spin interaction .",
    "several types of local and cluster - type updates will be described .",
    "consider the general hamiltonian for the ising model in a transverse field of strength @xmath7",

    "define the operators @xmath14 up to a constant , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath15 the constants @xmath16 are introduced for purposes that will become clear below .",
    "note that @xmath17 is not included as a term in the hamiltonian ( [ hsum ] ) but will be important in the simulation scheme .    in the sse approach @xcite to finite - temperature quantum monte carlo , the partition function @xmath18 is written as a power - series expansion , with the trace expressed as a sum over diagonal matrix elements in a suitably chosen basis .",
    "using ( [ hsum ] ) then gives @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a sequence of @xmath21 operator - index pairs ( hereafter referred to as operators ) : @xmath22,\\ldots , [ i(n),j(n)],\\ ] ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the standard basis @xmath25 is used .",
    "because of the constants added to @xmath26 in ( [ hd ] ) , the eigenvalues of these operators are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all non - zero terms in ( [ zn ] ) are therefore positive and can be used as relative probabilities in an importance sampling scheme .",
    "a term is specified by a state @xmath29 and an operator sequence @xmath20 .",
    "one can show that the total internal energy ( including the constants added to @xmath30 ) is given by @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the size of the operator sequence to be stored in computer memory scales as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 which converges or grows much slower than @xmath0 for most cases of interest .    in order to construct an efficient sampling scheme ,",
    "it is useful to cut the expansion ( [ zn ] ) at some power @xmath34 , sufficiently high for the remaining truncation error to be exponentially small and completely negligible [ @xmath35 clearly has to be @xmath36 .",

    "the truncation @xmath35 can be chosen arbitrarily ( small ) ; it is adjusted during the equilibration part of the simulation , e.g. , by requiring @xmath79 after each update .",

    "the normalized cumulative probabilities @xmath95 are stored in a pre - generated table ; @xmath96 in order to select the first index @xmath12 of the operator @xmath50 $ ] to be inserted , a random number @xmath97 is generated .",

    "the table size is smaller , corresponding to the number of spins within the range of the interaction ; clearly , the whole selection process should then be reduced to a single step for obtaining both @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( e.g. , selecting one out of a total number @xmath102 of operators and reading the corresponding @xmath83 from a table ) . the two - step procedure is advantageous for non - random long - range interactions , where it allows for the reduction of the size of the probability table from @xmath1 to @xmath0 . for random models ,",
    "the storage requirement is always @xmath1 , and it may then again be better to combine the first and second index searches , using a single size-@xmath1 table for all the cumulative probabilities of @xmath50 $ ] . for short - range random interactions",

    "the reject - and - repeat step leads to the correct probabilities for selecting among all the allowed diagonal operators @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "typically , an allowed operator is generated very quickly , since the interactions favor the allowed spin alignment .",
    "note that the constants @xmath65 $ ] are always allowed ( for @xmath105 ) , so there is no risk of the search never terminating .",
    "the off - diagonal update ( [ upd2 ] ) can be efficiently carried out if @xmath41 is first partitioned into separate subsequences for each site @xmath12 .",
    "subsequence @xmath12 contains only spin - flipping operators @xmath49 $ ] and constants @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "their positions in @xmath41 are also stored , to be used for recombining the subsequences after the update .",
    "the constraints on modifications at site @xmath12 imposed by ising operators @xmath50 $ ] or @xmath106 $ ] ( for any @xmath13 ) can be stored as flags indicating the presence of one or several of these operators between neighboring subsequence operators . updating a subsequence amounts to selecting two non - constrained neighboring operators at random from the subsequence , and carrying out the substitution ( [ upd2 ] ) if the two operators are identical .",
    "if they are different , they can be permuted . a number proportional to the subsequence length of such pair updates",
    "are carried out for each subsequence , after which they are recombined into a new @xmath41 .    the diagonal update ( [ upd1 ] ) at all positions in @xmath41 require @xmath107 operations , where the factor @xmath108 is the scaling of the average number of operations needed to search the cumulative probability table(s ) in the case of long - range interactions .",
    "partitioning @xmath41 into subsequences and updating all of them according to ( [ upd2 ] ) requires on the order of @xmath35 operations .",
    "hence , the number of operations for a full updating cycle of the degrees of freedom of the system ( one monte carlo step ) scales as @xmath109 .",
    "this should be compared to the @xmath110 scaling in worldline methods @xcite , where one power of @xmath0 is due to the summation required to calculate the weight change when flipping a spin interacting with @xmath0 other spins . here",
    "this summation has been circumvented by writing the interactions in the sse formalism as fluctuating constraints that are purely local .      in the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm @xcite for the classical ising model , i.e. , with @xmath76 and a uniform nearest - neighbor interaction of strength @xmath111 ,",
    "auxiliary bond variables @xmath112 are introduced in order to construct clusters of spins that can be flipped independently of each other . given a spin configuration , and with initially all bond variables",
    "@xmath113 , for every interacting spin pair for which @xmath114 ( i.e. , the orientation energetically favored ) the bond variable is set , @xmath115 , with probability @xmath116 .",
    "when all bonds have been visited , clusters of spins connected by @xmath115 bonds are formed , and each of these clusters is flipped with probability @xmath117 .",
    "single spins not connected to any @xmath115 bond are single - spin clusters .",
    "after the clusters have been flipped , all the bond variables are again set to zero and the process is repeated .",
    "this scheme can in fact be constructed using the sse formalism , as an alternative to the fortuin - kastelin mapping @xcite , on which the swendsen - wang algorithm is based .",
    "the relation to the swendsen - wang algorithm is shown as follows , by applying the sse method to the classical ising model , now again considering a general form of the interaction @xmath11 and with the bond - operator @xmath118 as in eq .",
    "( [ hd ] ) . since all operators @xmath94 commute",
    ", the operator @xmath119 can be written as a product of operators @xmath120 .",
    "the uniqueness of the power - series expansion then implies that in the sse , where @xmath119 is expanded directly , the probability of having one or more operators @xmath94 on a bond @xmath83 when @xmath121 is @xmath122 , i.e. , exactly the probability of having the bond variable @xmath115 in the swendsen - wang scheme . in a configuration @xmath123",
    "there can be no operators on the bond in the sse , and the swendsen - wang @xmath115 probability is also zero per construction .",
    "one can hence make the connection that one or more operators acting on a spin pair in the sse scheme corresponds to a filled bond ( @xmath115 ) in the swendsen - wang algorithm .",
    "the definition of a cluster is then exactly the same in the two algorithms .",
    "clearly , such a cluster in the sse can also always be flipped , since the ising operators only impose constraints on the relative orientations of connected spins , which is maintained when the cluster is flipped . since the weight does not change",
    ", the flip should be done with probability @xmath117 .",
    "the scheme is hence identical to the swendsen - wang algorithm , except that the filled bonds @xmath115 in sse are generated in a different way , using the diagonal update ( [ upd1 ] ) .",
    "note that for a classical model , all the propagated sse states ( [ propagated ] ) are identical , i.e. , @xmath124 for all @xmath125 , and hence no state propagations have to be considered as the diagonal update is carried out .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sse scheme for the classical ising model should in fact be more efficient than the standard swendsen - wang algorithm at high temperatures .",
    "this is because the number of operators in the sse operator list scales as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the total energy at temperature @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) and for large @xmath128 the construction of the clusters based on the operator list should then be faster than visiting all the bonds , as is done in the swendesn - wang algorithm .",
    "however , in practice the interesting physics occurs when the number of sse operators per interacting spin pair is of the order of one or larger , and then there are no advantages of the sse classical cluster algorithm relative to swendesen - wang",
    ".    the classical sse cluster update can also be used in the presence of the transverse field ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the clusters are defined in terms of bonds signifying the presence of one or more ising operator , as above , without regard for the single - spin flipping operators @xmath60 and constants @xmath16 .",
    "these operators can be neglected because when a cluster is flipped , all spins @xmath82 belonging to the cluster are implicitly flipped in all propagated states ( [ propagated ] ) , i.e. , @xmath103 @xmath69 @xmath131 for all @xmath125 ( this is the reason for the term `` classical cluster '' even when @xmath130 ) and hence all operations with the single - spin operators remain valid and produce the same factors in the weight before and after the cluster flips .",
    "note again that only the first state , i.e. , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , has to be stored when constructing the classical clusters .        in the case of long - range interactions ,",
    "a cluster can consist of several intertwined pieces on the lattice , as illustrated for a two - dimensional case in fig .",
    "[ c_cluster ] .",
    "regardless of the range of the interaction , the construction of the clusters , given an sse operator list , can be easily carried out using a number of operations scaling as the number of operators in the list .",
    "since the classical sse cluster update is equivalent to the swendsen - wang algorithm in the classical limit and only takes the ising terms into account also in the quantum case , it can not be expected to be efficient much beyond the classical limit @xmath76 . for a non - random system that undergoes a phase transition at @xmath134 when @xmath76 , the critical temperature is reduced by the transverse field ; @xmath135 . hence",
    ", the classical clusters will percolate for @xmath136 and this update will not be efficient close to @xmath137 .",
    "the primary reason to introduce the classical cluster update here was to demonstrate the relationship between sse and the swendsen - wang algorithm . in the case of long - range interactions ,",
    "the scheme becomes very similar to the luijten - blte algorithm @xcite , again just differing in the way the bonds are generated .",
    "the purpose of the quantum - cluster update is to effect flips of spins @xmath103 only in a limited number of propagated states @xmath45 , in different states for different sites @xmath12 . in other words",
    ", these clusters will be finite and irregularly - shaped both in the space and sse propagation ( imaginary time ) direction . in the process",
    ", operator substitutions @xmath138 ( constant to spin - flip , and vice versa ) will also be accomplished .",
    "this update hence replaces the local off - diagonal update ( [ upd2 ] ) .    to discuss the quantum - cluster update , it is useful to introduce the notion of _ vertices _ @xcite .",
    "looking at the graphical representation of a configuration in fig .",
    "[ conf ] , it can be noted that the vertical `` lines '' of same spins between two operators acting on a given site constitute redundant information .",
    "the full configuration can be represented by a list of positions ( on the lattice ) of the operators , and the spin states ( on one or two sites for the model considered here ) before and after the operators act .",
    "these relevant spins are called _ legs _ of the 2-spin vertices ( corresponding to constant and spin - flip operators ) or 4-spin vertices ( corresponding to ising bond - operators ) .",
    "all possible vertices for the transverse ising model are shown in fig .",
    "[ vertices ] .",
    "note that only those ising vertices that are compatible with the sign of the interaction between a given pair of spins are allowed for those spins ; again , this is due to the choice of constant in the bond - operator ( [ hd ] ) . in the computer ,",
    "the vertices are linked to each other by pointers , so that from a given vertex - leg one can reach the next or previous vertex that has a leg on the same site ( i.e. , there are links that replace the segments of vertical lines of same spins in fig .  [ conf ] ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the practical implementation of a linked vertex list has been given in ref .  .",
    "to construct and flip a quantum - cluster , one of the legs of one of the @xmath21 vertices is picked at random , and the corresponding spin is flipped . depending on the type of the vertex ,",
    "different actions are taken , examples of which are given in fig .",
    "[ q_cluster ] .",
    "the arrow pointing into the vertex indicates the _ entrance leg_. in the case of an ising vertex , all the four spins are flipped and the cluster building process branches out from all the legs , as indicated by the arrows pointing out from the vertex . using the pointers of the linked vertex list , the arrows point to legs of other vertices ;",
    "these become new entrance legs which are put on a stack and subsequently processed one - by one .",
    "if the entrance leg is on a constant or spin - flip vertex , only the entrance spin is flipped .",
    "the vertex type then also changes , in terms of operators from @xmath60 to @xmath16 , and vice versa . in these cases",
    "there is no branching - out and no new legs are put on the stack , i.e. , this particular branch of the cluster terminates .",
    "if a link points to a spin that has already been flipped ( i.e. , two arrows point toward each other ) , that leg should not be used again as an entrance and is hence not put on the stack .",
    "therefore , each vertex - leg can be visited at most once ( each spin can be flipped at most once ) and the cluster is completed when there are no more entrance - legs on the stack .",
    "the reason that the cluster can always be flipped is again that the sse weight is not affected ; the matrix element of the ising bond - operator is not affected when both spins are flipped ( in the absence of an external field in the @xmath139-direction , which would necessitate a modified approach ) , and the matrix elements for the constant and spin - flip operators are both equal to @xmath7 .            the construction of a single cluster , which is flipped with probability one , is a quantum - mechanical analogue of the classical wolff algorithm @xcite ; in the absence of the transverse field the clusters are identical to those of the wolff algorithm .",
    "note , however , that there is a difference when constructing more than one cluster : the number of operators in the sse operator list , and their positions on the lattice , do not change in the quantum - cluster update .",
    "the clusters are therefore completely deterministic once the operator list is given .",
    "hence , when constructing several clusters using the same sse operator list , it is quite likely that the same cluster is constructed and flipped multiple times .",
    "this is clearly not efficient .",
    "however , one can also construct all clusters , as in the swendsen - wang scheme , and only flip them with probability @xmath117 .",
    "this is done by always starting a new cluster from a vertex - leg which has not yet been visited .",
    "every vertex - leg belongs uniquely to one cluster , and clearly the number of operations required to complete this updates then scales as @xmath35 , i.e. , typically as @xmath140 .",
    "a natural definition of a monte carlo step including the quantum - cluster update is a full sweep of diagonal updates , followed by the construction of the linked list of vertices , in which all clusters are constructed and flipped with probability @xmath117 .",
    "after that , the updated vertex list is mapped back into a state @xmath78 and an operator sequence @xmath41 .",
    "free spins , i.e. , those that are not acted on by any operators , can again be considered as single - spin clusters and should also be flipped with probability @xmath117 .",
    "no local off - diagonal updates ( [ upd2 ] ) are needed .",
    "since the quantum - cluster update explicitly includes the quantum mechanical features of the configurations ( i.e. , the presence of spin - flip operators ) , it can be expected to work well also close to a quantum phase transition ( @xmath141 ) driven by varying @xmath7 .",
    "as a non - trivial demonstration of the method , a ferromagnetic chain with interactions decaying as @xmath3 is considered next . the interaction is summed over all @xmath83 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , i.e. , each pair is counted twice .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "@xmath11 includes both distances in the periodic system , i.e. , @xmath142 where @xmath111 sets the over - all energy scale .",
    "the classical @xmath3 ising chain has been the subject of numerous studies @xcite .",
    "the long - range interaction allows for a finite-@xmath128 phase transition even in one dimension .",
    "the transition is of an unusual kind , with the correlation length exponent @xmath143 , and a discontinuous jump in the magnetization at @xmath137 .",
    "it can be thought of as a one - dimensional analogue of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , with the topological excitations being kink solitons @xcite .",
    "the model is also important because it can be mapped onto the kondo problem @xcite .    for small @xmath144",

    "only a single field - strength @xmath151 is considered .",
    "the simulations show that @xmath152 in this case .",
    "the model is invariant with respect to flipping all spins , which means that for any finite system the average magnetization vanishes .",
    "the squared magnetization , @xmath153 is therefore calculated .",
    "results for @xmath154 with statistical errors in the fifth decimal place can easily be obtained for systems with several hundred spins ( and there are no problems in going to considerably larger systems ) . for small systems the results are in perfect agreement with exact diagonalization data .",
    "a `` tempering '' scheme , where @xmath155 is considered as an additional discretized dimension of the configuration space @xcite , was also implemented in the simulations .",
    "transitions satisfying detailed balance are carried out between neighboring @xmath155 values . this way , results can be obtained on a dense temperature grid with much less effort than by several fixed-@xmath155 simulations .",

    "the points with barely visible error bars are the simulation results .",
    "the curves are third - order polynomial fits.,width=264 ]    figure [ mag](a ) shows results for systems with @xmath0 up to @xmath160 . at high temperatures , @xmath154 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , as expected , and there is a slight increase with @xmath0 at low @xmath128 .",
    "the curves intersect at @xmath161 .",
    "a discontinuous magnetization jump at @xmath137 in the thermodynamic limit implies that @xmath154 should become size independent at @xmath150 for sufficiently large @xmath0 . a notable difference between the finite - size behavior of @xmath162 seen in fig .",
    "[ mag ] and the magnetization curves for the classical system is that in the latter case the curves do not intersect , but the infinite - size value @xmath163 is approached with a logarithmic correction @xcite .",
    "the reason for the different form of the finite - size scaling for @xmath164 should be clarified .",
    "figure [ mag](b ) shows in more detail the behavior in the region where the curves intersect .",
    "the point of intersection moves slowly towards higher @xmath128 as @xmath0 increases , and larger @xmath0 would be needed to extract @xmath137 accurately .",

    "this can be compared with @xmath166 for the classical model @xcite .",
    "a reduction of @xmath150 is expected on account of quantum fluctuations for @xmath130 .",
    "the quite small reduction for @xmath151 is consistent with the @xmath167 magnetization being only slightly reduced from the classical value @xmath168 .",
    "it would clearly also be interesting to study the quantum phase transition , but that problem is beyond the scope of this paper .    the high accuracy of these simulations demonstrate that the algorithm indeed is very efficient .",
    "the computer resources used for this work were quite modest ; on the order of @xmath169 cpu hours on an sgi origin2000 .",
    "the scaling of the cpu time is close to linear in @xmath0 for the @xmath3 interaction , for which the interaction sum ( [ in ] ) converges rapidly .",
    "only the local updates discussed in sec .",
    "ii  b were used in these simulations .",
    "the cluster updates have been tested as well and improve the performance .",
    "the quantum - cluster update should be particularly useful for studying the quantum phase transition , where there will be a broad distribution of the sizes of the clusters constructed in this update .",
    "a new approach to long - range interacting quantum models has here been developed within the framework of transverse ising models .",
    "it is important to note that the technique can also be generalized to other types of systems , with the usual caveat of sign problems @xcite .",
    "what is particular about the ising interaction is that it can be written so that a spin - spin term either gives zero or a constant when acting on an arbitrary basis state .",
    "this is what is needed in order to reduce the interactions to local constraints in the sse formalism .",
    "however , the algorithm can easily be modified to cases where the diagonal interaction can take several non - zero values .",
    "the first modification is in the diagonal update . for the ising model ,",
    "the probability of selecting a given bond ( [ hd ] ) is given by a matrix element corresponding to the spin pair being in a configuration energetically favored by the interaction .",
    "if the spins are in a non - favored configuration ( correspinding here to a vanishing matrix element ) the update is simply rejected . in the general case",
    ", the probability to use in this update should correspond to the largest diagonal matrix element on a given bond , and if the actual configuration corresponds to a smaller matrix element the update should be accepted only with a probability reflecting this smaller value ( i.e. , the ratio between the actual value and the largest matrix element ) . the quantum - cluster update can be modified by using ideas developed within the `` directed - loop '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "for example , there could be @xmath170-particle vertex processes where the whole vertex is not necessarily reversed as in fig .",
    "[ q_cluster](a ) .",
    "the process could instead either go straight through the vertex ( modifying the vertex only at the entrance and exit legs ) or `` bounce '' back without modifying the vertex at all .",
    "the details of how this is done in practice will of course depend on the types of diagonal and off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the main point to note is that in the sse approach all the information needed to update the vertices is contained in the vertices themselves , which are always local and can be generated in the diagonal update based purely on local decisions .",
    "the transverse ising simulation algorithm has here been tested on a one - dimensional model with long - range interactions decaying as @xmath3 .",
    "the program requires almost no modifications for higher - dimensional systems , and random interactions are also very easy to implement .",
    "future studies will have to address how well the method works in practice for a variety of systems that are more challenging because of frustrated interactions , long - range frustrated interactions , or even randomly frustrated long - range interactions . for short - range interactions , it would also be interesting to see how the sse quantum - cluster method constructed here compares to the transverse ising cluster method previously developed for continuous - time worldline simulations @xcite .",
