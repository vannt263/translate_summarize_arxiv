    "quantum heat engines ( qhe ) have recently attracted great interest since it was originally proposed in @xcite . like their classical counterparts , these engines employ a quantum system as the working substance and run cyclically between two heat baths that are at thermal equilibrium at different temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it absorbs @xmath3 heat from the hot bath at a temperature @xmath4 , performs certain mechanical work @xmath5 , and rejects heat @xmath6 to the bath at a temperature @xmath7 . due to the quantum property of the working substance",
    ", the qhes can give rise to large work efficiency @xmath8 beyond the limit set for a classical heat engine ( viz .",
    ", for a classical carnot engine , such limit is @xmath9 ) .",
    "scully and his coworkers have shown that it is possible to extract work from a qhe using quantum coherence @xcite or quantum negentropy @xcite , with a large work efficiency , compared to their classical counterparts .    several proposals for implementing quantum heat engines have been made using spin systems @xcite , harmonic oscillators @xcite , and multi - level systems @xcite . in @xcite , an ensemble of non - interacting two - level systems , driven by a local external field and subject to frictional force ,",
    "is coupled to the baths for _ finite _ time and the optimized time - scale of engine operation has been derived . in @xcite ,",
    "the interacting spins have been considered and the adiabatic processes have been performed by changing the local magnetic fields that drive the spins .",
    "correspondence of the efficiency of such coupled - spin system to the entanglement has been studied for heisenberg interaction @xcite and dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction @xcite .",
    "comparisons between quantum versions of carnot engine and otto engine have been studied in @xcite for a two - level system as well as for harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is further shown @xcite that photons in an optical cavity can also be used as a working substance for a qhe in which a coherent cluster of atoms serve the role of ` fuel ' through their superradiance .",
    "however , in all these proposals , the system undergoes a heat cycle , during which it interacts with a hot bath and a cold bath ( both modelled as a classical system ) in an alternative fashion .",
    "it is assumed that one can switch off the interaction with the bath during a certain stage of the heat - cycle , the so - called reciprocating cycle . for a quantum system , however , such an interaction is always on @xcite and it is experimentally challenging to turn it off or on during the heat cycle . dynamical decoupling from the bath by applying a certain pulse sequences @xcite to the system may serve the purpose .",
    "but , such a technological requirement can be overwhelming so as to mimic the classical heat cycle in a quantum system .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an experimentally feasible model of a single - ion qhe , that works like a reciprocating heat cycle , but maintaining the always - on interaction with the bath , like in the continuous heat cycles @xcite .",
    "the electronic degree of freedom of the ion is chosen as the working substance s , while its vibrational degree of freedom plays the role of the cold bath , that also interacts with the ion throughout the entire cycle .",
    "the thermal environment here acts as the hot bath .",
    "we show that while the hot bath thermalizes the state of s , the heat transfer to the cold bath can be achieved by a projective measurement of the states of s. practically speaking , in our model , only a single thermal bath is considered , while the vibrational mode is only an ancillary system , mimicking a ` cold ' bath .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption , that interaction with none of the baths is switched off , makes our model easily feasible in experiments .",
    "we show that the efficiency of this engine can be made close to unity by manipulating a local magnetic field ( that works as a  piston \" ) applied to the ion .",
    "note that the proposal of implementing qhe using a single ion exists @xcite , in which the frequency of the linear paul trap is changed during the isentropic processes of the heat engine , while during isochoric processes , the system is weakly coupled to the hot or cold bath to achieve the thermal equilibrium at the bath temperature .",
    "this model clearly requires alternative coupling to the baths .",
    "this proposal has been implemented using @xmath10ca@xmath11 ion with an efficiency 1.9% at the maximum power limit @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , in our model , one only requires to change the driving magnetic field adiabatically and a projective measurement of the electronic states , both of which can be routinely achieved in a trapped - ion set up @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the qhe model based on a single trapped ion .",
    "we present all the relevant hamiltonians and the achievable efficiency in this qhe . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe all the required stages of the heat cycles .",
    "we also present the conditions that are relevant to successfully implement these stages .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "in this paper , we focus on implementing a quantum otto engine ( qoe ) .",
    "this qoe cycle consists of four stages : a ) in ignition stroke ( an isochoric process ) the system s gets thermalized by absorbing @xmath12 heat from a hot bath at a temperature @xmath0 .",
    "b ) in the next stroke ( the ` expansion ' stroke ) , the system undergoes an adiabatic process , thereby maintaining the thermal equilibrium , such that any kind of exchange of heat with the bath is inhibited . during this process",
    ", an external work @xmath5 is done by the system amounting to an adiabatic change of a local driving field ( the ` piston ' ) .",
    "c ) in the following stroke , the ` exhaust ' stroke ( an isochoric process ) , the system releases @xmath13 energy to a cold bath , at an equilibrium temperature @xmath1 .",
    "d ) in the last stroke ( the ` compression ' stroke ) , the system initializes itself through an adiabatic evolution , that also initializes the local driving field . in the following",
    ", we will describe how to implement all these strokes using a trapped ion .",
    "a single trapped ion in lamb - dicke limit can be considered as a two - qubit coupled system [ see fig . 1 ] , in which the ion is confined in its two lowest lying internal states @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( represented by the relevant pauli matrices @xmath16 ) and the lowest lying vibrational states @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( such that @xmath19 vanishes , where @xmath20 is the creation operator of the vibrational mode ) .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the interaction between the internal and motional states of the ion can thus be written as ( in unit of planck s constant @xmath21 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the hamiltonian for the internal states of the ion , @xmath25 represents the energy of the phonons , relevant to the vibrational degree of freedom , and @xmath26 defines the interaction between the internal and the vibrational degrees of freedom of the ion .",
    "we consider that the internal states are driven by a local electric field with rabi frequency @xmath27 and a magnetic field of strength @xmath28 , applied along the quantization axis .",
    "the vibrational frequency of the ion is chosen as @xmath29 and @xmath30 represents the interaction between the internal states and the motional states of the ion .    in context of the qoe",
    ", we consider the internal degree of freedom as the working substance s. the eigenvalues of the relevant hamiltonian @xmath24 are given by @xmath31 , with the respective eigenstates @xmath32\\;,\\\\ \\label{npm}n\\mp & = & \\sqrt{2\\left[g^2+b^2\\mp b\\sqrt{g^2+b^2}\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      following kieu @xcite , we can now calculate the efficiency of a qoe based on the above two - level system s. the average energy of this system can be written as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 is the occupation probability of the energy eigenstate @xmath36 . comparing @xmath37 with the first law of classical thermodynamics , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 defines non - exact differential , see e.g. , @xcite ) , one can identify in the quantum regime the infinitesimal heat transfer as @xmath40 and the infinitesimal work done as @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , the heat transfer is associated with the change in the probability distribution for various eigenstates , while the work done is related to change in the energy eigenvalues , keeping the probability distribution the same .",
    "for the two - level system s , the heat absorbed @xmath12 during the ignition stroke can thus be written as @xmath42\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the @xmath44th energy eigenvalue while the system interacts with the hot bath at the temperature @xmath0 , @xmath45 is the initial probability of the @xmath44th energy eigenstates and @xmath46 is that after thermalization . in a similar way ,",
    "the heat released @xmath13 during the exhaust stroke can be written as @xmath47\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the @xmath44th energy eigenvalue while the system interacts with the cold bath at the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "note that during the adiabatic processes , the probabilities @xmath46 and @xmath45 do not change",
    ". however the energy eigenvalues @xmath49 change , due to the adiabatic change in the local driving field .",
    "the work done during the heat cycle can thus be written as @xmath50\\;,\\ ] ] leading to the following expression of the work efficiency @xmath51 : @xmath52}{\\sum_{n=1}^2e_n^h\\left[p_n(t_h)-p_n(t_l)\\right]}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{(e_1^h - e_2^h)-(e_1^l - e_2^l)}{e_1^h - e_2^h}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\frac{e_1^l - e_2^l}{e_1^h - e_2^h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact @xmath53 .",
    "if the local driving fields are changed from @xmath54 and @xmath55 to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , during the expansion stroke , the efficiency takes the following form : @xmath58 this suggests that in the limit of @xmath59 , one can achieve the efficiency close to unity . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the local electric field that drives the ion is kept constant at @xmath60 .",
    "further , the adiabatic process is performed by adiabatic changes of the magnetic field from @xmath61 to @xmath62 during the expansion stroke and from @xmath63 to @xmath61 during the compression stroke .",
    "such a control of the efficiency by a local magnetic field has also been proposed in @xcite .",
    "as outlined before , we consider the internal degree of freedom as the working substance s. on the other hand , in the lamb - dicke limit , the ionic motion is confined to its two lowest lying states , while the higher excited states are not populated . in this way , the motional states can be considered as the relevant two - level cold bath , such that average phonon number in the vibrational degree of freedom @xmath64 .",
    "note that the system s always interacts with this effective cold bath through the hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "the thermal environment at an equilibrium temperature @xmath0 also interacts with the system s and the ionic motion .",
    "the qoe consists of four different strokes - two isochoric strokes and two adiabatic strokes . in the following ,",
    "we describe how to implement all these strokes with the system s and the two baths identified as above .      during this isochoric process ( @xmath65 ,",
    "1 ) , the ion interacts with the hot bath and gets thermalized .",
    "this leads to the following mixed states of the system s and the phonons : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the occupation probability of the @xmath68th eigenstate @xmath69 of the total hamiltonian @xmath70 for the ( s+phonon ) system . to identify the eigenvalue @xmath71 ,",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath70 in the joint basis @xmath72 of the internal states and the motional states in the following matrix form : @xmath73 the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75    here @xmath69 can be written in terms of the joint basis of the internal and motional states as @xmath76 therefore , the reduced density matrix of the system s can be obtained by taking partial trace over the phonon states as @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] is a normalization constant .",
    "this can be written in terms of the energy eigenstates @xmath36 of the system hamiltonian through the inverse transformation of the eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) : @xmath79    using ( [ rhos ] ) and ( [ geeigen ] ) , we can have the occupation probability @xmath80 of the eigenstate @xmath36 as @xmath81 and @xmath82    assuming that the system s is initially prepared in the state @xmath14 , the heat absorbed @xmath12 during this stroke can be calculated using eq . ( [ qh ] ) as @xmath83    it must be reminded that during this stroke , the magnetic field is kept constant at @xmath54 , leading to the eigenvalues @xmath43 of the system hamiltonian @xmath24 to remain constant .      during this stroke ( @xmath84 , see fig .",
    "1 ) , the magnetic field is adiabatically changed from @xmath61 to @xmath63 .",
    "the system still maintains thermal equilibrium with the hot bath .",
    "this means that the occupation probabilities of the two eigenstates @xmath85 do not change ; however , the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath86 change to the values @xmath87 .",
    "this leads to the following work done during this stroke : @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the eigenvalues of @xmath24 before the stroke and @xmath46 are given by ( [ p1h ] ) and ( [ p2h ] ) .",
    "note that we change only the magnetic field , that does not change the internal state and only leads to a zeeman shift .",
    "this is an isochoric processs , durng whcih the system release @xmath13 heat to the cold bath ( @xmath90 , see fig .",
    "the initial state of the coupled system ( s+phonons ) at this stage can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath68-th eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath70 with a new value of magnetic field @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the corresponding occupation probability .",
    "note that , in the combined basis of internal and motional states , this eigenstate can be written as @xmath95\\;.\\ ] ] clearly , at thermal equilibrium , the system s is entangled with the phonon state .",
    "the occupation probabilities of the states of the system depend upon the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the release of heat from the system to the cold bath is equivalent to cooling down the system .",
    "this means that the occupation probabilities of the higher excited states of the system would reduce by such heat release . to facilitate the release of heat from the system to the phonon bath , here we propose a projective measurement of the state of the system s. by measuring the state @xmath14 of the system , the density matrix @xmath96 gets factorized and can be written as @xmath97 in this way , the system releases heat to the cold bath and thereafter gets decoupled from the cold bath .    through this cooling process , the probability distribution of the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian @xmath24 change , keeping the corresponding eigenvalues the same , as local driving fields are kept constant during this stroke .",
    "the heat released from the system to the cold bath can be thus be calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ qh ] ) and ( [ geeigen ] ) as @xmath98\\;.\\ ] ]      during this stroke ( @xmath99 , see fig .",
    "1 ) , the system again undergoes through an adiabatic process , during which the magnetic field strength is now adiabatically changed from @xmath63 to @xmath61 .",
    "the system remains in contact with the the hot bath and the vibrational mode - however , as during the expansion stroke , the occupation probabilities of the energy eigenstates @xmath36 remain unaltered at the values @xmath100 . the eigenvalues change from @xmath48 to @xmath43 due to the change in the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the following work done during this stroke : @xmath101      we find that the qoe absorbs heat @xmath12 [ eq .",
    "( [ qh1 ] ) ] during the ignition stroke and releases heat @xmath13 [ eq .",
    "( [ ql1 ] ) ] during the exhaust stroke , while it does certain work during the two adiabatic strokes .",
    "therefore , the work efficiency of the qoe can be calculated as @xmath102\\{z_{gn}^2-p_n(t_h)\\}}{\\sum_{n=1}^{2}e_n^h\\{p_n(t_h)-z_{gn}^2\\}}\\;.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the compression and expansion strokes in an otto engine are performed adiabatically , during which the system does not share heat with the bath . in the present case , for a quantum version of the otto engine , one needs to consider quantum adiabatic process .",
    "in such a process , the probabilities of the different eigenstates of the system hamiltonian remain unaltered , though the relevant eigenvalues are adiabatically changed .",
    "the adiabatic condition in quantum mechanics reads as @xmath103 @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the adiabatic strokes are performed by changing the magnetic field strength @xmath28 only .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ en ] ) , we obtain the following condition for adiabaticity : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the adiabaticity parameter and @xmath106 are given by eq .",
    "( [ npm ] ) .",
    "we consider a linear variation of the magnetic field , as given by @xcite @xmath107 in fig .",
    "2 , we show how the condition of adiabaticity is satisfied for different choices of the rate of change @xmath108 of the magnetic field .",
    "clearly , the adiabaticity is maintained , even for the evolution for a finite time @xmath109 .",
    "with respect to time @xmath110 .",
    "the parameters chosen are @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "clearly @xmath105 remains much less than unity for all the times for larger @xmath109 ( and therefore for slower change of the magnetic field ) , thereby referring to an adiabatic evolution.,width=302,height=226 ]    in the case of @xmath114 for all the times @xmath110 , we can rewrite the adiabaticity parameter @xmath105 as @xmath115 for a change of magnetic field from @xmath61 to @xmath63 in a finite time interval @xmath109 , we obtain the following condition for adiabaticity : @xmath116 it must be reminded that to obtain larger efficiency , one needs to have @xmath117 adiabatically [ see eq .",
    "( [ eff - fin ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , as clear from eq .",
    "( [ cond3 ] ) , the corresponding time - interval becomes quite large .",
    "we have shown how a single trapped ion can be used to implement quantum otto engine .",

    "we show that by adiabatically changing the local magnetic field , the work efficiency can be made close to unity .",
    "the interaction with the hot and the cold bath is never switched off . in this framework , we show that the heat release to the cold bath can be mimicked by a projective measurement of the electronic state of the ion .",
