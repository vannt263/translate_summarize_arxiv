    "it is now clear that a classification of pne based on their morphology ( balick 1987 ; schwarz , corradi , & stanghellini 1993 ; manchado et al .",
    "1996 ) also corresponds to a real physical classification of the nebulae and of their stellar progenitors .",
    "correlations between morphology and other properties of the nebulae / stars were recognized quite a long time ago ( cf .",
    "greig 1972 ; peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ; zuckerman & gatley 1988 ) , and confirmed recently by the analysis of extensive ( and thus statistically more robust ) , homogeneous , and high - quality image atlases ( balick 1987 ; schwarz , corradi , & melnick 1992 ; manchado et al .",
    "1996 ; gorny et al . 1999 ) .",
    "one of the most extensive analyses is that of corradi & schwarz ( 1995 , hereafter cs95 ) , who considered 400 pne with high - quality optical images and studied in detail the correlation of the morphological properties with several other physical properties , giving particular emphasis to the comparison between the elliptical ( @xmath2 ) and bipolar ( @xmath0 ) pne .",
    "i stress once more the quite strict definition of  according to the classification of schwarz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : these are elongated , axially symmetric pne distinguished by an `` equatorial '' waist from which two faint , extended lobes depart .",
    "cs95 found that  have : + _ a ) _ a scale height on the galactic plane of 130  pc compared to the value of 320  pc for the @xmath2 objects and of 260  pc for the global sample of galactic disk pne ; + _ b ) _ smaller deviations than the other morphological types from pure circular galactic rotation ; + _ c ) _ the hottest central stars among pne ; + _ d ) _ chemical overabundances of helium and nitrogen ; + _ e ) _ outflow velocities up to an order of magnitude greater than the typical expansion velocities of pne ; + _ f ) _ giant dimensions ; + _ g ) _ different `` evolutionary '' tracks in the two - color iras diagram .",
    "the above properties  especially _ a , b , c , d_indicate that  are produced by more massive progenitors than the other morphological classes .",
    "these results were later confirmed by other authors ( e.g. gorny , stasinska , & tylenda 1997 ; see also manchado , this volume ) .    in this contribution",
    ", i will add some comments to the discussion of those properties which appear to be most important for understanding the formation of the different morphological classes i then discuss whether these put real constraints on the models and present some other recent results on .",
    "as mentioned above , the conclusion that  have more massive progenitors than  is consistent with several properties of the nebulae and their central stars .",
    "but the only property which allows us quantitatively to derive mass limits for the progenitors of the different morphological classes is the distribution of the nebulae along the vertical ( @xmath4 ) direction of the galactic disk .",
    "the method is to compare the @xmath4-distribution of pne with that of main - sequence stars in the galaxy . to do this , an exponential - in-@xmath4 distribution function is usually assumed , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the scale height .",
    "note that this distribution function has the convenient property that @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 , where , @xmath11 , and @xmath12@xmath9@xmath13 are the mean , the standard deviation and the median , respectively , so that one would be tempted to derive @xmath6 by simply measuring .",
    "the exponential function which a scale height independent from the galactocentric distance appears to be a good representation for the distribution of light ( star volume density ) in spiral galaxies ( wainscoat et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-distribution of 35  and 119  in cs95 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the histograms are indeed fairly well fitted by exponential distributions , with @xmath6 = 130  pc and @xmath6 = 320  pc for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 types , respectively .",
    "cs95 also computed @xmath6 = 260  pc for the whole sample of galactic disk pne .",
    "these figures should be compared to the scale heights of main - sequence stars in the galaxy , which as shown in fig .  2",
    "are basically divided into two regimes : @xmath6 around 100  pc for spectral types earlier than f5 , and around 300  pc for types later than f8 .",
    "the increase of @xmath6 with spectral type is thought to be an age effect , caused by the so - called `` dynamical heating '' of the disk ( wielen et al .",
    "1984 ) , which would produce a continuous growth of the @xmath4-velocity dispersion of stars . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clear that  are associated with the low @xmath6 regime , while  with the high @xmath6 one .",
    "this corresponds to limits of @xmath14  for the initial mass of the progenitors of , and @xmath15  for the .",
    "these figures are only slightly different from those quoted by cs95 , being slightly more conservative according to the discussion below of the uncertainties involved in their derivation .      in deriving mass limits for the progenitors of the different morphological classes from the galactic @xmath4 distribution",
    ", one should consider the following points :    * the main limitation in this kind of analysis is the uncertainty in the distances of individual pne .",
    "considering that  are a very peculiar class of nebulae , it would not be surprising if their distances obtained via the usual statistical methods were affected by systematic errors",
    ". it would be sufficient that their distances were underestimated by a factor of two to raise serious doubts about the existence of a real difference in their galactic scale height with respect to the whole sample of pne . to remove this doubt ,",
    "i have estimated _ kinematical _ distances for the sample of  in cs95 .",
    "as is widely known , the method consists in assuming that the objects participate in the general circular rotation around the galactic center .",
    "their distances are then estimated by comparing their apparent radial velocities with those expected for circular orbits as a function of heliocentric distance and galactic longitude .",
    "errors in the distances provided by this method are large , but it remains the only method which , at present , can be applied to many , and which is free from risk of systematic errors . a comparison of the kinematical distances with those adopted by cs95 for 30  is plotted in figure  3 .",
    "apart from an obvious large dispersion of points , from this plot we can exclude the possibility that the distances of  were underestimated by cs95 by a factor of two or more , since in that case they would preferentially lie close to the 2:1 relation ( dashed line ) , while most of them are instead found close to the 1:1 relation ( solid line ) .",
    "in fact , computing the scale height of the 30  using the kinematical distances , yields @xmath16150  pc .",
    "thus this exercise fully confirms the results of cs95 . * when determining the scale height of a class of objects , one has to be careful with the sample size .",
    "the number of objects should be large enough to check whether the exponential model distribution is a fair representation of the observed one , and that it is sufficiently well sampled . the derivation of @xmath6 directly from  for small samples should also be avoided . * as discussed above , main - sequence stars in the galaxy are basically divided into `` early - type '' stars with @xmath16100  pc and `` late - type '' objects with @xmath16300  pc , the rapid transition to larger scale heights occurring between spectral classes f0 and g5 . considering the uncertainties involved in the derivation of the scale height for pne , and in particular the present poor knowledge of distances , it is therefore not possible to derive precise mass values for their progenitors .",
    "note also that the reference samples of stars are a mixture of main - sequence objects of different ages ( recently born or on the point of leaving the main sequence ) while the pne are clearly all very evolved objects .",
    "a population of pne is then expected to lie at higher @xmath4 than a ( younger ) random mixture of its main - sequence progenitors , provided that the main - sequence lifetime is sufficiently long to allow the dynamical heating of the disk to act .",
    "this introduces an additional uncertainty into the analysis . for these reasons , it is not advisable to derive more accurate masses for pn progenitors than those which result from dividing them in the above two scale height regimes . taking a mass value in the middle of the transition from low to high scale heights for main - sequence stars , say 1.3  corresponding to spectral types f5-f8 , the only robust conclusion is therefore that the progenitors of  have initial masses greater than this value , while those of  have smaller ones .",
    "although the difference in progenitor masses of @xmath0 and @xmath2 pne is a very important constraint that must be taken into account when explaining their formation , at present it does not appear to be able to discriminate as to whether these morphological classes are produced by single or binary systems , which is one of the main topics of this conference .    the fact that  have higher - mass progenitors is the basic starting point for _ single _ star theories .",
    "garca - segura et al . ( 1999 ) conjecture that , if the initial mass is larger than @xmath17  ( note that this limit coincides with that derived in the previous section for ) , stars might rotate on the agb with a velocity close to the critical one , causing a markedly aspherical mass deposition .",
    "this is because their cores would not have been spun down onto the main sequence ( as occurs for lower - mass stars ) , evolve decoupled from the envelope , and remain fast rotators until angular momentum is redistributed on the agb , spinning up the outer layers .",
    "rotation would force the envelope ejection in the equatorial plane of the agb star , providing the correct mass - loss geometry needed to form a bipolar pn .",
    "but _ binary _ models also have an explanation for the higher progenitor masses of .",
    "in fact , according to soker ( 1998 ) a low - mass star in a binary system would interact strongly with the companion already on the rgb ( the ratio of the stellar radii during the agb and the rgb , @xmath18/@xmath19 , is small for low - mass stars ) , causing an enhanced mass - loss which would leave a low - mass and small agb envelope .",
    "then the interaction with the companion on the agb would be weak preventing the formation of a @xmath0 pn . on the other hand , higher - mass stars , for which @xmath18@xmath20@xmath19 , would mainly interact on the agb , and because of this interaction would be able to produce a @xmath0  pn .",
    "in addition , it should be mentioned that mellema ( 1997 ) showed that in low - mass stars the post - agb evolution is slow enough for the ionization front to have time to smooth out the density contrast between the equatorial plane and the polar directions , preventing the formation of a bipolar pn even if the agb mass - loss geometry were the favorable one . in higher - mass stars ,",
    "the post - agb evolution is so fast that the density distribution is unchanged .",
    "it should be calculated , however , whether this conclusion still holds for clumpy distributions of gas .",
    "the association of  with the chemical type i , i.e. with he- and/or n - rich objects , has been known since peimbert s 1978 paper .",
    "cs95 discussed the amount of data available in the literature in 1995 , and more recently their results were refined by means of new observations .",
    "corradi et al .",
    "( 1997b ) and perinotto & corradi ( 1998 ) made a detailed spatially resolved study of the abundances of a sample of 15 with the following main results :    * within the errors , the nebulae are _ chemically homogeneous _ in he , o , n ; * ne , ar , and s abundances have systematic increases toward the outer regions of the nebulae .",
    "this might be due to errors inherent to the use of the standard _",
    "icf _ method ( alexander & balick 1997 ) ; * it is confirmed that  are overabundant in he and n ( type i ) with respect to elliptical pne , as indicated in table  1 . this is ascribed to efficient second and third dredge - up and burning at the base of the convective envelope in the most massive progenitors ; + lllll + & he / h & o / h@xmath21 & n / o & n / h@xmath21 +   +   & 0.15 ( 27 ) & 3.97 ( 27 ) & 1.24 ( 28 ) & 4.17 ( 27 ) +   & 0.11 ( 66 ) & 5.03 ( 68 ) & 0.40 ( 61 ) & 2.10 ( 60 ) + sun & 0.10 & 8.51 & 0.12 & 1.02 + * the highest he overabundances displayed by some  ( e.g. m  3 - 2 , he  2 - 111 , and ngc  6537 ) can not by reproduced by any current model of agb evolution ; * oxygen depletion is suggested for the nebulae with the highest n / o abundances , indicating that an efficient on cycle process has occurred in their progenitors .",
    "let s now turn our attention to `` massive '' stars .",
    "soker ( 1998 ) has argued that 3040% of massive stars ( m@xmath22  ) have companions in the right separation range to form bipolar ( @xmath0 ) pne .",
    "the other 6070% would form elliptical ( @xmath2 ) nebulae . if evolution in a binary system do not affect the chemical enrichment of the stars , then one expects to find , at any abundance interval in the range for massive pne progenitors , twice as many @xmath2 as @xmath0 pne ( assuming the same nebular life time ) . in our sample , after correcting for sample size effects , for large he and n abundances we have instead the reverse situation , with more @xmath0 than @xmath2 pne .",
    "this raises the question of where all the non - bipolar pne with large he and n abundances are ( the expected progeny of single massive stars ) ?",
    "an explanation within the binary scenario would require _ extra enrichment _ caused by the binary interaction .",
    "one hint in this sense is the fact that the highest he abundances of  are not reproduced by any current model for single stars .",
    "there were some strong suggestions in the past that the symmetry axis of aspherical pne were not oriented randomly within the galaxy .",
    "in particular , melnick & harwit ( 1975 ) and recently phillips ( 1997 ) have claimed that axially symmetrical pne have their axes preferentially inclined at low angles to the galactic plane .",
    "such a property would put very interesting constraints on the mechanisms producing the asphericity in pne . in other classes of objects , as in sn remnants ( gaensler 1998 ) and nebulae ejected by massive stars ( hutsemekers 1999 ) , the nebular orientation , for instance , was found to be clearly related to the galactic magnetic field .",
    "based on a larger and more homogeneous sample , and on a more rigorous statistical analysis than in the previous studies , corradi et al .",
    "( 1997a ) showed instead that there is no strong evidence for such an alignment , at least partially removing interest to the issue .",
    "finally , i conclude with a brief comment on the observations of binary stars in pne and their relation with . a review of very close binaries , with periods of a few hours to a few days ,",
    "is presented by h. bond in this volume .",
    "these objects are expected to have undergone a common envelope phase during the agb evolution of the star which has now ejected its pn .",
    "although most pne with a close binary nucleus are aspherical , only a relatively small fraction of them ( some 25% ) has a truly bipolar nebula .    in my opinion",
    ", the situation looks more promising for wider interacting binaries which avoid the common envelope phase , as also supported by soker ( 1997 ) . in this respect ,",
    "known detached binaries like symbiotic stars give a practical demonstration of the ability of these systems to form bipolar nebulae , rings and jets . in symbiotic stars containing a mira ,",
    "all nebulae are markedly aspherical , and about a half are bipolar / ring .",
    "this suggests that the kind of interactions occurring in these systems ( formation of collimating accretion / excretion disks , production of collimated fast winds from the hot components ) might provide the explanation of the collimation of the outflows in .",
    "a thorough discussion of the nebulae around symbiotic stars and of their similarities with  can be found in the contributions of corradi et al . and mikolajewska ( this volume ) , as well as in corradi et al .",
