    "the time spent by a quantum particle passing through a potential barrier has been one of the most controversial question since the founding of quantum physics and has attracted considerable attention from both a theoretical perspective and a experimental view@xcite @xcite .",
    "there are various approaches dealing with tunneling time@xcite , but there has been no clear - cut answer to this old question @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently a number of experiments@xcite@xcite@xcite indicating superluminal transmission of photons has renewed interest in this subject .    in quantum mechanics",
    ", time enters as a parameter rather than an observable .",
    "thus , there is no direct way to calculate tunneling time . for particles with given energy there exist at least three different notions of the traversing time in the literature@xcite@xcite@xcite , i.e. , the wigner - time , the bttiker - landauer time and the larmor - time , corresponding to different criteria .",
    "the wigner time accounts for how long it takes for the peak of a wave packet to emerge from the exit face of the tunnel barrier relative to the time that the peak of the incident wave packet arriving at the entrance face .",
    "the calculation of the wigner time is based on an asymptotic treatment of tunneling as a scattering problem utilizing the method of stationary phase to calculate the position of the peak of a wave packet .",
    "this tunneling time is simply the derivative of the phase of the tunneling amplitude with respect to the energy of the particle .",
    "bttiker and landauer consider the case that the height of the barrier or the amplitude of the incident wave is modulated sinusoidally in time .",
    "they have found that if the frequency of the modulation is very low , the tunneling particle will see the instantaneous height of the barrier and the transmitted waves adiabatically follow the modulation . however , as the frequency of the modulation increases , the transmitted waves will no longer be able to follow adiabatically the rapidly varying modulation .",
    "the bttiker - landauer time is the modulation period such that the transmitted wave begins to depart from an adiabatic following of the modulation .",
    "larmor precession was first introduced long ago as a thought experiment designed to measure the time associated with scattering events@xcite .",
    "subsequently the method was applied to measure the tunneling time of particles penetrating barrier with a magnetic field confined to the barrier region , causing the spin of particle to precess@xcite . the original scheme @xcite considered only the rotation of the spin in the plane that is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "later it was recognized that a particle tunneling through a barrier in the magnetic field does not actually perform a simple larmor precession in a plane@xcite .",
    "the main effect of the magnetic field is to align the spin with the field since the particle with spin parallel to the magnetic field has lower energy and less decay rate in barrier region than that of particle with spin antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the total angular change of the tunneling particle divided by the larmor precession frequency is the larmor time@xcite .",
    "the literature also invokes a dwell time@xcite @xmath0 defined as the ratio of integrated probability density over the barrier region to the incident flux .",
    "the dwell time measures how long the matter wave in the barrier regardless of whether the particle is reflected or transmitted .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit the larmor precession of a neutral spinning particle with a general spin coherent state as a clock to measure the tunneling time through a barrier and extend for the first time the study of quantum tunneling to the relativistic regime .",
    "the advantage of using the spin coherent state is that an equation of motion for the expectation value of spin operator in the magnetic field within a barrier is obtained and identified with the equation of spin precession . with the help of the equation of motion",
    "we find that both nonrelativistic and relativistic neutral spin 1/2 particles perform a simple larmor precession in three - dimensional space .",
    "the lamor precession time of spin in a magnetic field confined to the potential barrier is compared with the time in the absence of barrier in order to show the apparent superluminal tunneling .",
