    "the following work is based on the research reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . it pursues the objective of empathizing the analogy between accessible condensed matter systems and the currently accepted framework for the evolution of the universe , notably the symmetry - breaking phase transitions @xcite it has undergone after the big - bang . a key aspect to this comparison is the creation of topological defects , frustrations of the unbroken phase within the broken one , arising from the continuity of the order parameter values .",
    "these are generally categorized according to the homotopy group of the quocient of the unbroken symmetry groups to the broken one and which enables for comparison of different physical phenomena .",
    "these objects can appear as magnetic monopoles or point - like defects , cosmic strings , vortices or flux tubes , magnetic domain walls or textures .",
    "besides its mere aesthetical value , this analogy can provide a powerful probe into the early stages of the evolution of the universe , since direct , hands - on experimental tests are unattainable : the existence of more accessible systems that exhibit a formally similar behavior could provide crucial clues to many cosmologically relevant issues .",
    "these `` cosmology in the laboratory '' experiments can be found in various systems , ranging from vortices in superfluid phase transitions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which exhibit common features with cosmic strings @xcite , to liquid crystals undergoing an isotropic - nematic phase transition @xcite .",
    "polymer chains were shown to also possess analogous thermodynamic and transitional behavior @xcite .",
    "however , most of these systems lack the existence of a quantity analogous to the magnetic field , which could be a key player in the early evolution of the universe and formation of structure .",
    "for that reason , superconductors are a case of special interest .",
    "these comprise phase transitions involving a local gauge symmetry - breaking process , during which the photon acquires a `` mass '' and , therefore , a penetration length , giving rise to the meissner effect : the expulsion of the magnetic field from a superconducting material , with formation of shielding `` supercurrents '' on its surface .",
    "this symmetry breaking originates topological defects which are known as flux tubes or vortices , lines of non - null magnetic field trapped inside the superconductor .",
    "experiments targeted at observing defect densities in high-@xmath2 materials @xcite were not in accordance with the density predictions of the kibble - zurek ( k - z ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "this , however , is to be expected , since the k - z prediction should be accurate only for global gauge symmetry breaking , when the geodesic rule for phase angle summation is valid . a new defect generation mechanism , based on a local gauge treatment by hindmarsh and rajantie ( h - r ) @xcite , leads to an ( additive ) prediction .",
    "this , although well below the first carmi - polturak experimental sensitivity , is in reasonable agreement with the second .    as a starting point for this research",
    ", we note that the above experiments were both conducted in type - ii materials , which exhibit a higher critical temperature and are therefore easier to manipulate , leading the current trend in experimental superconductivity .",
    "these materials display a second order phase transition , with no release of latent heat . on the other hand ,",
    "type - i materials are metastable , showing different responses to a magnetic field when in normal - superconductor or superconductor - normal phase transitions . in this work",
    ", we try to account for this more elaborate behavior and to estimate to which extent it affects the defect density predictions for type - i superconductors .",
    "type - i and type - ii superconductors are commonly distinguished according to their ginzburg - landau (",

    "this degeneracy of the phase transition at @xmath24 is , however , only verifiable to the current experimental sensitivity , and it can be argued that there is some yet undetected intrinsic metastability , regardless of the applied magnetic field .",
    "bearing in mind the analogy between condensed matter and cosmology , we now briefly look at phase transitions in high energy physics . in thermal field theory ( tft )",

    "the introduction of @xmath30 in the potential ( [ pot ] ) can produce changes in both the k - z and h - r defect generating mechanisms .",
    "also , a possible nucleation suppression due to the potential barrier can significantly reduce the number of observed defects .",
    "the obtained constraints on @xmath31 are used to access the impact on these claims .",

    "[ t_sh ]    due to the presence of the cubic term in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ 3pot ] ) , the superheating curve shows a zero - field shift in temperature from @xmath2 by @xmath44 .",
    "this shift , if detected , would indicate an intrinsic metastability , in the sense that it does not depend on the existence of an applied field . since such temperature shift has not yet been signaled , the current experimental temperature sensitivity being @xmath45 @xcite , a bound on the slope of @xmath46 is    <",
    "t_exp  . [ tbound ]    the supercooling transition still occurs at @xmath47 , the critical temperature ; this is natural , since it is determined solely by @xmath48 ( neglecting a smaller order correction to @xmath10 , @xcite ) .",
    ".critical properties of @xmath49 and @xmath50 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ table2 ] provides a comparison of the bounds on @xmath51 with the cubic term arising from 1-loop corrections in tft and the prediction of ref .",
    "this is achieved by computing the slope of @xmath52 from @xmath53 , obtaining @xmath54 .",

    "( [ 3pot ] ) , through a convenient @xmath8 factor ; the electron mass determines the conversion as it is absent from the kinetic term of the lagrangean density of field theory , @xmath58 , but present in the corresponding condensed matter free energy term , @xmath59 ; equivalently , one can loook at the coherence length : @xmath60 _ vs. _ @xmath61 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in the absence of an applied magnetic field , momentum fluctuations of the gauge field have an expectation value derived from the equipartition theorem . integrating over momentum space ( with a cutoff @xmath62 of the order of @xmath63 ) , one gets    a^2_= 4 _ 0 t_c - 8 _ 0 e c t_c ||  .",
    "[ meangauge ]    hence , from this result arises , asides from an unimportant correction to the scalar field mass ( or coherence length ) , a more relevant ( negative ) cubic term , @xmath64 . at zero field",
    ", this produces a shift in the superheating temperature of    _ t = 7.25 10 ^ -12 t_c^3 h_c(0)^2 _ 0 ^ 6  , [ deltat ]    with @xmath65 expressed in _ gauss _ and @xmath18 in @xmath66 .",
    "for sn , it requires a temperature sensitivity of @xmath67 , well below current possibilities .",
    "al , however , requires just a sensitivity of @xmath68 , attainable if one employs state of the art relative temperature measurement techniques .",
    "one can see that , for both materials , the slopes of @xmath46 predicted by tft and ref .",
    "@xcite have similar magnitudes @xmath69 .",
    "this is a confirmation of the underlying analogous mechanisms : one can view the thermal averaging of the gauge field in condensed matter as equivalent to finite temperature vacuum polarization , given by renormalization of 1-loop feynmann diagrams .",
    "we now discuss possible implications of the presence of this cubic term in the mean - field potential : the k - z mechanism predicts a topological defects ( vortices ) density of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the characteristic time scale , given by the gorkov equation , @xmath72 is the quench time , and @xmath73 is a critical exponent .",
    "one topological defect per @xmath74 area is assumed .",
    "since the characteristic scales @xmath18 and @xmath4 are obtained by linearizing the g - l equations close to @xmath2 , thus neglecting the @xmath46-cubic and @xmath14-quartic terms contribution , we expect no significant changes to @xmath18 and , hence , to this prediction .",
    "the defect density predicted by the h - r mechanism for a thin slab of width @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the domain size after the transition and is related to the highest wave number @xmath78 to fall out of equilibrium .",
    "this is obtained from the adiabaticity relation    = ^2(k )  .",
    "[ dispersion ]    for an underdamped dispersion relation , one has @xmath79 and the photon mass is given by @xmath80 .",
    "this leads to a defect prediction @xmath81 .",
    "recall that the penetration length @xmath4 expresses a non - null photon `` mass '' arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking that occurs during the normal - to - superconductor phase transition .",
    "the presence of a cubic term in the potential will change the photon mass , as the true vacuum of the broken phase shifts to    = -3 + 4  .",
    "[ field ]    however , since @xmath82 , the effect is , as in the k - z case , too small to affect the h - r prediction in a significant way",
    ".    there is also a non - vanishing probability of the order parameter to quantum tunnel from the false vacuum towards the true one .",
    "the rate of transition per unit volume and time is given , in the thin wall approximation , @xcite    = t^4(s_3 2  t)^3/2e^-s_3/t  .",
    "[ decayingrate ]    s_3(t ) = 281 1 ^7 ^9(t ) ^2(t )   [ thinwall ]    is the euclidean action , and @xmath83 the  depth \" of the true vacuum . for the thin wall approximation to be valid",
    ", one assumes that the barrier s height is much greater than this `` depth '' @xmath84 , which implies that @xmath46 is comparable to @xmath10 and @xmath14 , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "since , as shown above , the current temperature sensitivity of @xmath86 only allows for @xmath87 , the approximation breaks : the field should always tunnel through the potential barrier , that is , with a probability close to unity .",
    "therefore , topological defect production is unsuppressed , and one does not need to be concerned that these may not have sufficient time to nucleate within the measurement s resolution time .",
    "in this work we have examined a description of a type - i superconductive phase transition including a cubic term in the g - l mean - field potential , inspired both by analogy with tft 1-loop corrections and gauge field thermal averaging @xcite .",
    "superheating field and temperature constraints impose bounds on this cubic term so that its effects are small compared to that of other parameters in the g - l potential . in particular , there is negligible impact on the defect density predictions of k - z @xcite or h - r @xcite , with no suppression or slowing down of defect production due to nucleation suppression arising from the induced potential barrier between false and true vacua .    in the absence of any sizeable perturbations ,",
    "the h - r prediction for topological defect density in type - i superconductors should be reduced by a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "however , it has been suggested that defects nucleated in type - i materials survive significantly longer than in type - ii @xcite : for type - i superconductors , their lifetime is expected to be of order @xmath89 seconds .",
    "this increases the possibility of measuring the created defects before they disappear , possibly compensating for an inferior net number .    finally , we point out that the superheating temperature shift induced by a cubic term , derived either from ref .",
    "@xcite or from tft 1-loop corrections , increases with decreasing @xmath22 ( @xmath90 ; @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus , possible searches for a cubic term should be conducted with extreme ( @xmath92 ) type - i materials like @xmath10-tungsten , which displays @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "also , much more precise bounds could be attained by using a dc squid to measure the shift in the supercritical field , since this device currently possesses a sensitivity of @xmath95 , or @xmath96 over a 10 @xmath97 m grain diameter .",
