    "the bak  sneppen ( b  s ) model is an abstract representation of a biological system that evolves according to the darwinian principles of random mutation and natural selection .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite in the context of self - organized criticality in systems with spatial interactions .    despite its simplicity , the b ",
    "s model captures some of the features that are believed to be characteristic of evolving biological systems .",
    "in particular , it predicts evolutionary activity on all time scales with long periods of relative stasis interrupted by bursts of activities , referred to as _ avalanches_. as a consequence of the absence of a characteristic time scale , evolutionary dynamics in the b  s model display long - range dependence in both the temporal and the spatial domain .",
    "it is thus suitable as an abstract representation of systems in punctuated equilibrium , a concept that was introduced in @xcite to explain the patterns observed in fossil records . for a more thorough discussion of these ideas , and for applications of the notion of punctuated equilibrium in other scientific disciplines",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in addition to its usefulness in abstractly representing some key features of palaeontology and macro - evolution , the b  s model has also been employed to analyze the evolution of bacteria in a controlled , competitive environment . in a series of key experiments @xcite , lenski and",
    "collaborators cultivated twelve initially identical populations of an e.  coli strain over several years and conserved samples at regular time intervals .",
    "they then determined the relative fitness of the conserved samples by putting them into direct competition with a sample taken from the initial populations and measuring their relative growth rates .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the b  s model with random mutations qualitatively reproduces some of the experimental results on relative bacterial fitness obtained in lenski s long - term experimental evolution project @xcite . using an extended multi - trait variant , @xcite extended the explanatory scope of the b  s model to include experimental findings about the interplay of adaptation , randomness and history in bacterial evolution .      the bak ",
    "sneppen model characterizes each species in a biological system by a numerical fitness value between zero and one , which represents its degree of adaptedness to its environment and changes as the species evolves .",
    "further , each species is assumed to directly interact with exactly two other species , where it is left unspecified if such an interaction represents competition for resources , predator - prey relations or something different entirely . the bak ",
    "sneppen model can therefore be visualized as points on a circle , where each point stands for an ecological niche ( or a species occupying that niche ) and neighboring species interact with each other .",
    "as time progresses , the fitness landscape evolves in accordance with the following rules , representing in an abstract way the principles of random mutation and natural selection : at each time step , the least adapted species , i.e. the one with the smallest fitness parameter , is removed from the system ( becomes extinct ) and its place is immediately taken by a new species whose fitness is initially modelled as an independent uniformly distributed random variable . in order to take into account the effect of this change on the local environment , the fitness parameters of the two species to either side of the least fit one are also reset to random values .",
    "this can be thought of as those two species themselves becoming extinct and superseded by new ones , or as them undergoing mutations in response to their neighbour becoming extinct .      despite its apparently easy definition , the b ",
    "s model has withstood most attempts at mathematical analysis in the past .",
    "partial results have been obtained , however , in the context of rank - driven processes @xcite and mean - field approximations @xcite .",
    "early on it was conjectured based on simulations that the steady - state fitness distribution at a fixed site converges , in the limit of large populations , to a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath2 is approximately equal to 0.667 , but believed to be slightly larger than @xmath3 .",
    "there is only a small number of mathematically rigorous result about the bak  sneppen model ; in @xcite it is shown that the steady - state fitness at a fixed site is bounded away from one in expectation , independent of the number of species in the system ; a characterization of the limiting marginal fitness distribution , conditional on a set of critical thresholds , is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite , the author proposes to compute the steady - state fitness distribution as the fixed point of the one - step transition equation and uses this method to describe the asymptotic fitness distribution for four species in terms of a compact rational function . in the same paper",
    "it is shown that one can not find a similarly simple formula in the b ",
    "s model with five species , and that the fitness distribution of a randomly selected species at steady - state in this case is not only not rational , but not even a hypergeometric function .      in this paper",
    ", we revisit the bak ",
    "sneppen model with five species . in [ thm - main ] , our main theorem , we establish a representation of the steady - state fitness distribution for five species in terms of the solution of an explicit differential equation with hypergeometric coefficients .",
    "this steady - state distribution encodes information about the fitness attributes of species in a system that has evolved for a long time .",
    "for instance , one can deduce from it how fit , on average , a randomly selected species from the population is expected to be ; this is done in [ cor - marg ] .",
    "furthermore , since the steady - state distribution contains information about the joint fitness values of all species in the population , its knowledge allows to draw biologically relevant conclusions about qualitative properties of the system , such as the emergence of one or several dominant species , or the fragmentation of the eco - system into areas of different prevailing fitness . in our simple model ,",
    "the symmetry of the initial configuration is preserved and no such phenomenon occurs .",
    "it is an interesting question whether in systems with a more complicated interaction between species , symmetry can be spontaneously broken .",
    "we envisage that similar representations for the asymptotic fitness distribution in larger systems may help pave the way towards a resolution of the question of whether or not , in the limit of infinitely many species , the fitness is indeed asymptotically uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 .",
    "we speculate that the techniques developed in this paper can be generalized to analyze larger systems with more than five species .",
    "it seems plausible to expect that the asymptotic joint fitness distribution in such systems can still be characterized as the solution to a certain linear differential equation , even though the coefficients might no longer be hypergeometric functions .",
    "we adopt the following formalization of the bak  sneppen model from @xcite .",
    "initially , all fitness parameters are independent uniformly distributed and after @xmath4 evolutionary steps the state of the system is represented by the vector @xmath5 ^ 5 $ ] , where the @xmath6th component refers to the fitness of the @xmath6th species .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics of the system can be expressed formally by the equation @xmath7 ^ 5,\\quad a\\in\\mathscr{b}([0,1]^5),\\ ] ] where the one - step transition kernel @xmath8 encodes the dynamics of the model and is given by @xmath9 here , and in the following , all vector indices are taken modulo five .",
