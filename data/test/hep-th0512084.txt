    "in this contribution we discuss a model for noncommutative quantum mechanics ( ncqm ) where noncommutativity in the phase space is considered in the context of the gravitational quantum well ( gqw ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider the dependence of the energy spectrum of the gqw on the mass of the particles in order to study the quantum to classical transition @xcite    recently , there has been quite some interest on the noncommutative geometry in the context of quantum mechanics .",
    "this has its roots on the role that noncommutative geometry plays in unification models and in string theory .",
    "indeed , since the discovery that the low - energy effective theory of a d - brane in the background of a ns - ns b field lives in a noncommutative space @xcite , many efforts have been devoted to the study of noncommutative field theories ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , to the understanding of the coupling to gravity ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) and , to the non - relativistic limit , through versions of ncqm @xcite .",
    "although in string theory only the coordinates space exhibits a noncommutative structure , models in which the noncommutative geometry is extended to the phase space have been recently much discussed @xcite .",
    "the main argument for this approach is that noncommutativity between momenta arises naturally as a consequence of noncommutativity between coordinates , as momenta are defined as the partial derivatives of the action with respect to the noncommutative coordinates @xcite . in a 4-dimensional space",
    ", this type of phase space structure is defined through the following algebra : [ noncommutation_1 ] x^,x^]=&i^  , p^,p^]=i^  , x^,p^]=i^  , where the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are antisymmetric .",
    "this algebra is consistent with standard quantum mechanics thanks the last commutation relation in the set of eqs .",
    "( [ noncommutation_1 ] ) .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a 2-dimensional version of this algebra , defined by the noncommutative parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 and by planck s constant @xmath6 has been considered [ noncommutation_2 ] x , y]&=&i  , p_x , p_y]=i  , x_i , p_j]=i_iji=1,2  .",
    "the implementation of this algebra can be performed by considering the noncommutative variables @xmath7 from the commutative variables @xmath8 through linear transformations .",
    "two sets of linear transformations can be used to obtain the complete algebra , eqs .",
    "( [ noncommutation_2 ] ) .",
    "the first kind of transformation affects only the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while the second affects variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 , thus leading to different results . to eliminate this ambiguity",
    "it is convenient to consider a set of linear transformations that modify simultaneously all variables : [ linear_1 ] x=(x-2p_y )  ,   y=(y+2p_x )  ,   p_x=(p_x+2y )  ,   p_y=(p_y-2x )  , where @xmath13 is a scaling factor . in this way ,",

    "hence , one can define a _",
    "4-dimensional effective planck constant _ as : [ planck_constant_1 ]",

    "furthermore , it is clear that the commutation relation between coordinates and momenta is not diagonal , the off - diagonal elements are proportional to products of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "( [ linear_1 ] ) to determine the noncommutative hamiltonian for a particle moving in the @xmath16 plane subject to a uniform gravitational field @xmath17 .",
    "as the effects of phase space noncommutativity are presumably small , we have compared the leading order corrections to the commutative hamiltonian with the experimental results obtained by nesvizhevsky _ _ et al.__@xcite for neutrons in the gqw formed by a horizontal mirror and the earth s gravitational field .",
    "this has allowed us to set an upper bound of about mev / c for the fundamental momentum scale introduced by noncommutativity , @xmath18 .",
    "supposing that the fundamental noncommutative length scale , @xmath19 , is smaller than the neutron size , that is , of order @xmath20 , we have found that @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the difference between the effective planck s constant and the usual planck constant has no practical effects .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a particular choice of the value of the scaling factor @xmath13 the commutation relation between coordinates and momenta is exactly defined by the usual planck constant .",

    "what follows we shall present our analysis of the gqw in the context of the ncqm .",
    "we consider now a particle of mass m moving on the @xmath16 plane in a uniform gravitational field @xmath17 .",
    "when a horizontal mirror is placed at @xmath22 , a gqw is set up . in the direction transverse to the gravitational field ,",
    "@xmath11 , the particle is free , exhibiting a continuous energy spectrum . in the direction of the gravitational field , @xmath9 ,",
    "the particle exhibits a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "its wave function in the @xmath23-th quantum level is given by the airy function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , with energy eigenvalues given by : [ gqw_2 ] e_n=-(mg^2 ^ 22)^1/3_n  , where @xmath27 corresponds to the @xmath23-th zero of the airy function and @xmath28 to the maximum height",
    "that is classically compatible with a particle with energy @xmath29 .",
    "the probability of finding the particle is non - vanishing for all values of @xmath30 .",
    "however , when @xmath9 exceeds the value of @xmath31 for each quantum state @xmath23 , this probability decays exponentially , but the particle has a finite probability of penetrating a classically forbidden region through quantum tunneling .",
    "these ideas have been used to study the spectrum of neutrons in the quantum well of the earth s gravitational field and a horizontal mirror @xcite .",
    "an ultra cold neutron beam was employed , with a mean velocity @xmath32 , traveling through a narrow slit formed by the mirror and a scatterer / absorber placed above it .",
    "therefore , the neutron flux through the apparatus is measured as a function of @xmath9 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "neutrons in the @xmath23-th quantum state have a small probability of crossing the gravitational barrier and tunnel into the scatterer / absorber .",
    "this probability is given by @xmath34 and vanishes as the slit height increases .",
    "hence , for @xmath33 , neutrons pass through the slit with little loss . for @xmath35 , however , neutrons have a @xmath36 probability of being absorbed by the scatterer and so the slit is not transparent to neutrons .",
    "thus flux of neutrons through the slit is given by : [ gqw_4 ] f(x)=f_0_n_n (    -l_nv\\ {    ll e^(-43_n^3/2 )  , _",
    "n>0 + 1,_n<0    }    )  , where @xmath37 is a normalization factor , depending on the incident flux , @xmath38 is the relative population of the @xmath23-th quantum level , @xmath39 is the length of the slit and @xmath40 @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ gqw_4 ] ) , one can conclude that , for @xmath41 , the flux of particles in the @xmath23-th state approaches its maximum value @xmath37 , while for @xmath42 , this flux tends to vanish .",
    "therefore , the classical turning points @xmath31 separate two regions where the neutron flux exhibits distinct behaviour for each state @xmath23 . by adjusting the experimentally measured flux to the predicted flux given by eq .",
    "( [ gqw_4 ] ) , the values of the two lowest classical turning points were obtained @xcite , and these are in good agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions , namely @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we mention that the equivalence principle in the context of the gqw has been analyzed in ref . @xcite .",
    "we consider now the discussed gqw , with hamiltonian given by : [ hamiltonian_1 ] h=p_x^22m+p_y^22m+mgx  .",
    "the corresponding noncommutative hamiltonian can be straightforwardly obtained using the inverse transformations of eq .",
    "( [ linear_1 ] ) , for @xmath15 , [ linear_inverse ] x=c(x+2p_y )  ,   y=c(y-2p_x )  ,   p_x=c(p_x-2y )  ,   p_y=c(p_y+2x )  , to replace the commutative variables by the noncommutative ones : [ hamiltonian_2 ] h&=&c^22m(p_x-2y)^2+c^22m(p_y+2x)^2 + + mgc(x+2p_y)= + & = & c^22mp_x^2+c^22mp_y^2+mgc2p_y+c^22m(xp_y - yp_x)+c^28m^2 ^ 2(x^2+y^2)+mgcx  , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noticed that [ aux_1 ] c^22mp_y^2+mgc2p_y=12m(cp_y+m^2g2)^2-m^3g^2 ^ 28 ^ 2  , so that the last term is an additive constant that can be subtracted from the hamiltonian . through the redefinition [ momenta ]    as : [ hamiltonian_3 ] h=|p_x^22m+|p_y^22m+c2m(x|p_y - y|p_x ) + c^28m^2 ^ 2(x^2+y^2)+mgcx - mgc4 ^ 2x  .",
    "notice that the last two terms correspond to the commutative gravitational potential , @xmath47 .",
    "thus the noncommutative hamiltonian is given by [ hamiltonian_4 ] h=|p_x^22m+|p_y^22m+mgx + c2m(x|p_y - y|p_x)+c^28m^2 ^ 2(x^2+y^2 )  .",
    "the similarity between the first three terms in the commutative and noncommutative hamiltonians is clear , the only difference lying in the redefined momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the constant term in the definition of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ momenta ] ) , has , however , no physical meaning as it corresponds to a translation of all the eigenvalues of @xmath50 by the same amount .",
    "it does not imply any change in the commutation relations of this operator either .",
    "thus , the only physical difference between @xmath10 and @xmath49 concerns the factor @xmath51 and likewise for @xmath12 and @xmath48 , meaning that the kinetic terms in the noncommutative hamiltonian differ from the commutative ones only by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "we study now the physics of the hamiltonian eq .",

    "notice that as @xmath53 , to first order in the noncommutative parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are equal to @xmath12 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we can then conclude that at this order of approximation the noncommutative hamiltonian differs from the commutative one by a term proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the configuration space noncommutativity does not influence the gqw energy spectrum to leading order .",
    "it is expected that @xmath5 is a small correction at the quantum mechanical level , and so one can treat the new term as a perturbation to the commutative hamiltonian . the shift caused by this term on the energy levels of the system",
    "is given by the expectation value of the perturbed wave function of the system .",
    "we note that as the airy function is real , @xmath54 , and hence [ aux_3 ] p_x _ n&=&_0^+dx_n^*(-i_n ) = -i([_n^*_n]_0^+-_0^+dx_n)= + & = & i_0^+dx_n_nx= -_0^+dx_n^*(-i_n)=-p_x_n=0  , where , due do the presence of the horizontal mirror , we have used that @xmath55 and the normalization of the wave function . therefore , the term proportional to @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian_5 ] ) does not yield any shift on the energy levels , whatever the expectation value of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the perturbed potential due to noncommutativity is at leading order given by [ perturbative_1 ] v_1=2mxp_y  .",
    "this is clearly analogous to a potential describing the effect of a magnetic field @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the direction perpendicular to the plane , on a particle of charge @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this is of course simply a formal analogy with no physical meaning , as particles in the gqw must be neutral , as is the case of the neutrons used in the experiment by nesvizhevsky and collaborators .",
    "the leading order energy correction to the @xmath23-th quantum state is given by the expectation value of potential eq .",
    "( [ perturbative_1 ] ) [ perturbative_2 ] e_n^(1)=k2m_0^+dx_n^*(x)x_n(x)= k2 m  , where the integral @xmath60 is defined as : [ aux_4 ] i_n__n^+dz(z)z(z )  , and @xmath61 for the experiment described in ref .",
    "the values of the normalization factor @xmath62 and of the integral @xmath60 were determined numerically for the first two energy levels : [ numerical_1 ] a_1= 588.109  , a_2= 513.489  , i_1=-0.383213  ,  i_2=-0.878893  . with these values , the leading order corrections to the energy levels",
    "are given by : [ energy_corrections ] e_1^(1)=2.8310 ^ 29",
    "( j )  , e_2^(1)=4.9410 ^ 29  ( j )  .",
    "finally , requiring these corrections to be smaller or of the order of the maximum absolute energy shifts allowed by the experiment , the following upper bounds for @xmath5 are obtained : [ eta_bounds_1 ] || & 2.3210 ^ -61  kg^2m^2s^-2  ( n=1 )  , || & 1.7610 ^ -61  kg^2m^2s^-2  ( n=2 )  .",
    "these values correspond to the following upper bounds on the fundamental momentum scale : [ eta_bounds_2 ] || & & 4.8210 ^ -310.90  ( n=1 )  , +     we compute now the energy correction of second order on the noncommutative parameters .",
    "the second order perturbed potential is the following : [ perturbative_3 ] v_2=2 ^ 2p_x^22m+2 ^ 2p_y^22m+^28m^2(x^2+y^2 )  .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath63 and @xmath64 do not affect the particle s energy spectrum in the direction of the gravitational field and , hence , do not give rise to any shift on the discrete energy levels .",
    "thus , the second order perturbed potential reduces to : [ perturbative_4 ] v_2=2 ^ 2p_x^22m+^28m^2x^2  .",
    "there are now two second order terms that can modify the energy spectrum of the particle .",
    "the first one is proportional to the kinetic energy in the direction of the gravitational field ; the second one is formally identical to an harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath65 .",
    "the energy correction due to the first term on the @xmath23-th quantum state is given by [ perturbative_5 ] e_n^(2a)=-4m_0^+ dx _",
    "n^*(x)^2_nx^2(x ) = -4ma_n^2(2m^2g^2)^13j_n  , where the integral @xmath66 is defined as [ aux_5 ] j_n__n^+dz(z)d^2dz^2(z )  .",

    "one can resort to the bound on the value of the coordinates commutator , obtained in a different context @xcite , @xmath67 ( which correspond to @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) or , consider a more conservative point of view and argue that the fundamental length scale introduced by noncommutativity should be at least smaller than the minimum scale compatible with the quantum mechanical approach to the gqw problem .",
    "this scale is given by the average neutron size of about @xmath20 , below which the neutron s internal structure becomes relevant . with this hypothesis",

    "it follows that the perturbation approach is reliable using the upper bounds obtained for @xmath5 for both quantum states . clearly , if had we used the bound on @xmath4 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy corrections would have been about ten orders of magnitude smaller .",

    "_ experiment constrains the fundamental momentum scale to be below the mev / c scale . of course",
    ", one could expect the fundamental scale to be smaller than this .",
    "an increase in the precision of the experiment may lead to more stringent bounds on the value of @xmath18 if the results are still consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "one should take into account , however , that the experimental energy resolution is bounded by the uncertainty principle due to the finite lifetime of the neutron @xcite .",

    "we turn now to the discussion of the conditions for the transition between the quantum and the classical descriptions in the context of the gqw .",
    "this is a central and recurrent issue in quantum mechanics .",
    "more recently , this somewhat conceptual and philosophical discussion has become a quite concrete experimental problem given the impressive new experiments of interference of macromolecules @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the conditions under which the quantum coherence of complex systems is lost have been carefully examined .",
    "it is believed that determining the drawing line between quantum and classical behaviour may bring new insights on the nature of macroscopic objects which exhibit quantum properties @xcite . in this work",
    ", we study the transition between the quantum and classical regimes in the gqw .",
    "in such a system , particles exhibit a discrete energy spectrum and present a non - vanishing probability of tunneling into classically forbidden regions .",
    "we analyze how an increase in the particles mass may destroy these quantum properties , so that the system will , at least from an experimental point of view , behave as its classical analogue .",
    "hence , we suggest a generalization of the nesvizhevsky _",
    "_ experiment @xcite with neutrons to more massive particles , such as atoms and fullerene - type molecules .",
    "the proposed criteria is based on the assumption that the dependence of separation between quantum states is a reliable criteria for establishing the quantum to classical divide , at least within the experimental resolution .",
    "we shall consider atoms and fullerene - type molecules .",
    "the gqw is a convenient system for testing if a system exhibits a quantum or a classical behaviour , given that its energy spectrum depends on the mass of the particles involved . in what follows",
    "we shall analyze the consequences of increasing the particle s mass and consider its experimental implications .",
    "we point out that , for all particles , the energy spectrum approaches a classical continuous spectrum for high energies .",
    "this can be shown explicitly for our problem studying the asymptotic form of the zeros of the airy function @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can show that , both @xmath76 and @xmath77 tend to zero as @xmath78 .",
    "also , @xmath79 is strictly decreasing with @xmath23 , and hence the largest separation between consecutive heights @xmath31 occurs for the first two quantum states .    let us now consider the effects of increasing the particle s mass . from eq .",
    "( [ gqw_2 ] ) , one can conclude that all energy eigenvalues are proportional to @xmath80 , the same occurring for the separation between consecutive energy eigenvalues .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected , as one assumes that this separation decreases with increasing mass .",
    "however , one should note that the experimentally relevant quantities are the heights @xmath31 .",
    "one can conclude that these heights and the separation @xmath81 , are proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "hence , for more massive particles , it is more difficult to distinguish consecutive levels . if two of these can not be separated experimentally , the quantum states can not be distinguished and the spectrum appears classical .",
    "thus , as the largest separation between values of @xmath31 occurs for the two lowest quantum states , if the particles mass is large enough so that the experimental error is larger than @xmath83 , there will be no means of distinguishing two consecutive classical turning points . in this case",
    ", the flux of particles through the slit will show a classical behaviour , increasing as @xmath84 , where @xmath9 is the slit height @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that classical or quantum behaviour depend on the experimental resolution and on the mass of the particles .",
    "this can be quantified in the following way : for a minimum uncertainty , @xmath85 , to measure the slit height , one can distinguish at least two consecutive quantum states if the particle s mass does not exceed @xcite : [ limit_1 ] m_max=(_1)^3/2  .",
    "for instance , with the error of @xmath86 for @xmath73 @xcite , one could distinguish the first two quantum states for particles with a mass @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the mean mass of a nucleon .",
    "equivalently , in order to distinguish two quantum states of a particle with mass @xmath89 , one must require as maximum experimental error : [ limit_2 ] _",
    "max=(^22m_n^2g)^1/3_1a^-2/310.3 a^-2/3  .",
    "moreover , the uncertainty principle places limits on the experimental resolution for particles with a finite lifetime .",
    "measuring @xmath31 , an uncertainty @xmath90 is equivalent to an uncertainty @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , in order to have sufficient spatial resolution to separate the first two quantum states of a particle with mass @xmath89 , its mean lifetime must be greater than : [ limit_3 ] _ min=(2m_ng^2)^1/3a^-1/3_16.310 ^ -4a^-1/3  . for the nesvizhevsky _",
    "set up , the minimum lifetime is @xmath92 ms , which is 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the neutron s mean lifetime of 885.7 s @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty principle allows a precision up to @xmath93 , meaning that the experiment can be further improved .",
    "another implication of the increase on the particle s mass is the decrease in the probability of tunneling through the gravitational barrier . as already referred to , in the state @xmath23 this probability",
    "is given by @xmath94 .",
    "this rapid decrease is expected since in the classical limit particles with energy @xmath29 can not be found at a height greater than @xmath31 .",
    "naturally , the frequency @xmath95 , which can be viewed as the frequency of the collisions between the particles and the gravitational barrier @xcite , increases as @xmath80 , an effect that is not compensated by the decrease of the tunneling probability .",
    "thus , more massive particles exhibit a sharper transition between zero and maximum flux , turning the transition to the classical limit @xmath96 discontinuous .",
    "this makes it more difficult to observe distinct quantum states .",
    "till now the focus of our discussion has been on point - like particles . for neutrons ,",
    "the average radius of about @xmath97 is @xmath98 smaller than the value of @xmath99 and so it can be neglected . however , as the particle s mass increases , the affect of their size must be taken into account .",
    "let us then examine the size effects on the gqw energy spectrum . before that we point out that although the gqw problem has only been solved for point - like particles , some of the consequences of the particles finite size may still be inferred to from a qualitative analysis .",
    "indeed , let us assume that the effects of gravity on all particles which make part of a massive system are much smaller than the effects of the forces which bind them .",
    "therefore , one can focus on the movement of the massive particle s center of mass ( cm ) , which behaves as a point - like particle .",
    "the most salient difference between these descriptions is that the wave function of a composed particle exhibits an additional dispersion around the position of its cm .",
    "this dispersion is quantified by the particle s mean radius , @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , in the gqw experiment , when the slit height becomes of order @xmath101 , the absorber gets sufficiently close to the wave function of a particle in the @xmath23-th state and the latter can be absorbed at @xmath102 .",
    "thus the transition between the regions of maximum and minimum flux occurs in the neighborhood of @xmath101 and not at @xmath31 , as for a point - like particle . if @xmath103 , this effect must be taken into account .",
    "another finite size consequence is that massive particles will tend to leave the lowest quantum states less occupied .",
    "the horizontal mirror implies the wave function of each of the elementary particles that constitute the composed one vanishes at the origin .",
    "this implies that the composed particle must be above the horizontal mirror .",
    "hence , the particle s cm must be at a height larger than its average radius @xmath100 . if @xmath104 , particles in the @xmath23-th level are only allowed to be in the classically forbidden region , where they have a very low probability of being found .",
    "it then follows that the great majority of particles will tend to be found in quantum states @xmath105 and higher .",
    "the more massive the particle the more likely it will lie at higher quantum states .",
    "this solves an apparent paradox of our previous discussion , namely that the growth in the particle mass implies an increase in the separation between its energy levels .",
    "however , as its size also increases , the particle is more likely be found in the higher quantum levels , where @xmath106 .",
    "one must also bear in mind that , as the whole particle must lay above the horizontal mirror , there is a minimum value of the slit height , corresponding to the average diameter of the particle . for @xmath107 of order @xmath101 ,",
    "one is no longer able to observe the transition between zero and maximum flux .",
    "this occurs when @xmath108 , so that one can not measure the @xmath23-th quantum state as the particle can not be found at this level .",
    "hence , one is unable to test experimentally whether particles of radius @xmath108 are not really in the @xmath23-th quantum state .",
    "we consider now the properties of the particles that may be used to test the quantum to classical transition in the gqw .",
    "clearly , these particles must possess the following features : ( i ) they must be electrically neutral so that neither electromagnetic effects overlap the gravitational ones nor that the decoherence of the particle beam is induced .",
    "a high level of symmetry in the spatial distribution of electrons prevents polarization effects . having vanishing total spin avoids the coupling to external magnetic fields ; ( ii ) they must have long lifetimes , so to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ limit_3 ] ) .",
    "thus , radioactive particles are not suitable ; ( iii ) the horizontal velocity of the beam must be small so to maximize the time particles remain as gqw states .",
    "given these requirements , atoms are , after neutrons , the natural choice in the mass hierarchy . from conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , they can not be in ionized states and must be stable isotopes with valence electrons in @xmath109-type orbitals . considering that the main contribution to an atom s mass is due its nucleons , @xmath89 , thus from eqs .",
    "( [ limit_2 ] ) and ( [ limit_3 ] ) one computes @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the former has been plotted in figure 1 for @xmath112 ( lanthanides and actinides are excluded ) . from these results",
    "one concludes that the maximum allowed error lies in the range @xmath113 .",
    "the minimum lifetime can be shown to lie in the range @xmath114 ms .",
    "the atomic radius can be estimated using the average value of the radial coordinate for a hydrogen type atom @xcite , substituting the atomic number , @xmath115 , by an effective one , @xmath116 , which accounts for shielding effects of inner electrons according to the slater rules @xcite : [ r_atoms ] r = a_02z_eff[3n^2-l(l+1 ) ]  , where @xmath117 m is the bohr radius and @xmath118 denote the atom s valence orbital quantum numbers . in figure 2",
    "the values of the ratio @xmath119 for atoms with @xmath112 are shown , and one sees that they lie in the interval @xmath120 .     for atoms and fullerene molecules.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : fraccao ]    the next scale in the mass hierarchy are molecules .",
    "there is a broad variety of molecules , but few satisfy our criteria . among these ,",
    "fullerenes or _ buckyballs _ , large groups of @xmath121 , stand out as suitable candidates .",
    "these molecules are highly symmetric ( @xmath122 has spherical symmetry ) and are globally neutral , although with a slight polarization @xcite . they are considerably larger than atoms and the higher number of correlated particles enhances the probability of decoherence of the beam through interactions with the external environment .",
    "furthermore , they have a large number of internal degrees of freedom , rotational and vibrational , and can radiate , yielding in interactions with the external environment . despite these properties ,",
    "fullerenes are more appropriate than most massive molecules for the gqw study .    for pure @xmath121 fullerenes , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the number of carbon atoms .",
    "the values of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for fullerenes up to 3840 carbon atoms ( after the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) were computed using eqs .",
    "( [ limit_2 ] ) and ( [ limit_3 ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath110 are exhibited in figure 1 .",
    "one obtains that in order to distinguish the first two gqw states of these molecules the maximum error must lie in the interval @xmath125 , corresponding to a minimum lifetime of 0.02 to 0.10 ms .    supposing a fullerene to be modeled by a sphere of radius @xmath100 , than the area of the sphere must be proportional to the number of carbon atoms @xcite , @xmath126 , where the constant @xmath127 is determined using values of ref .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 for fullerenes is shown in figure 2 and is in the range @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , one can see that the finite size effects can not be neglected for the largest fullerenes .",
    "one can estimate the value of @xmath124 for which @xmath100 becomes of the order of @xmath99 , yielding that molecules with more than about @xmath129 carbon atoms will have a quite small probability of being found in the lowest quantum state of the gqw .",
    "this means that , the considered fullerenes ( @xmath130 ) , can be found at the first quantum level .",
    "in this contribution we have studied the two - dimensional gqw . on a first instance",
    "we have considered its noncommutative version in phase space and used the latest results from the experiment by nesvizhevsky _",
    "_ to constrain the fundamental momentum scale introduced by noncommutativity to be smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "further improvements in the experimental precision could allow for achieving the minimum upper bounds of about @xmath132 .",
    "we conclude that to leading order , noncommutativity in configuration space does not affect the energy spectrum of the system .",
    "supposing that the latter introduces a fundamental length scale smaller than the neutron s size , we find that the model implies in a modification of the planck constant which is experimentally consistent by many orders of magnitude .    furthermore , we have considered the consequences of the increase in the particles mass and size on the energy spectrum of the usual gqw .",
    "we find that it leads to a decrease in the separation of consecutive classical turning points .",
    "this implies that the more massive the particles , the greater the precision required to distinguish the lowest two quantum states .",
    "the precision already achieved allows studying particles up to @xmath133 . for heavier atoms",
    ", it is required to increase the precision of position measurements at least by a factor of 10 . for fullerenes up to @xmath122 , this increase in precision may be sufficient , but for larger molecules such as @xmath134 an improvement by at least a factor of 1000 is required    of course , performing this kind of experiment with sizable particles implies in considerable experimental challenges , which involve strong isolation from external agents such as electromagnetic fields , precautions to avoid collisions so not to decohere the particle s beam and ultra cold beams of particles to maximize the captured time in the gqw . nevertheless , despite these difficulties , this kind of experiment might be of relevance for testing the limits of applicability of the quantum mechanics . in the proposed set up",
    ", the transition to a classical regime is made independently of the phenomenon of decoherence , depending only on the mass of the particles in the gqw and on the experimental resolution .",
    "observing quantum states of massive particles in a gqw may turn out to be a relevant complement to quantum interference experiments with complex molecules .",
