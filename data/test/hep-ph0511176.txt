    "is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a concrete example we consider the one - loop box integral with two adjacent external legs off - shell and massless propagators , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the powers of the propagators @xmath15 and the dimension @xmath16 are kept arbitrary and we will derive a mellin - barnes parameterization of the box - integral in this general case . in this section , we will seek values for @xmath17 where the representation is well defined and the integral is finite . in the next section , we will explain the technique for the analytic continuation to the values of the parameters , such as @xmath18 , where the integral develops divergences .",
    "our starting point is the feynman parameterization of the box integral : @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the main tool for obtaining the mellin - barnes representation of the above integral is the formula : @xmath21 where the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath22 are complex numbers with @xmath23 , 2 .",
    "the contour of integration is a straight line parallel to the imaginary axis separating the poles of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "we can use the identity of eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep ] to simplify the entangled denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : box_2m_fp ] , with the cost of introducing new integrations in the complex plane .",
    "before we do so , we would like to point out an attractive feature of eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep ] .",
    "the above two conditions guarantee that the integrand in the right hand side of eq .  [",
    "eq : mbrep ] vanishes at infinity .",
    "we can then close the contour of integration at infinity and calculate the integral using the cauchy theorem .",
    "if we close the contour to the side of the positive real - axis we obtain @xmath27 this is the taylor expansion of the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep ] in the region @xmath28 .",
    "equivalently , by closing the contour of integration to the side of the negative real axis , we obtain a taylor expansion in the complementary region @xmath29 .",
    "this is a particularly useful property : representations of feynman integrals which are derived by using the mellin - barnes decomposition are valid in all kinematic regions .",
    "in addition , @xmath22 can be complex ; therefore , we can account for the infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath30 that is assigned to invariant masses and kinematic parameters .",
    "3 may be recursively applied to denominators with more than two terms , yielding : @xmath31 we are now ready to apply the decomposition of eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep_multi ] to the denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : box_2m_fp ] , introducing three contour integrations : @xmath32 where the contours must satisfy condition 2 above , i.e. they must be chosen in such a way that the arguments of the gamma functions are all positive .",
    "it is now straightforward to integrate out the feynman parameters , using @xmath33 to exchange the order of integrations , we must assume that the exponents of the feynman parameters satisfy @xmath34 with these conditions the gamma functions on the right hand side of eq.[eq : int_feynman ] have arguments with positive real part as well .",
    "the final result is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and we have adopted the shorthand notation @xmath37 in general , mellin - barnes representations for a loop - integral are well defined for number of dimensions and powers of propagators which render the real parts of the arguments in all gamma functions positive .",
    "for example , it is impossible to satisfy positivity in all gamma function arguments for @xmath38 .",
    "this is in accordance with the expectation that the scalar box integral is infrared divergent in four dimensions .",
    "but , for example , the representation of eq .",
    "[ eq : box_2m_mb ] is well defined if we choose the contour @xmath39 and the parameters @xmath40 . in the next section",
    "we will detail the analytic continuation from values of parameters for which the mellin - barnes representation is well - defined to values for which the integral develops divergences .",
    "that is , a procedure which makes the divergences appear explicitly in the form of poles in the parameter space .",
    "from eq .",
    "[ eq : box_2m_mb ] we observe that it is simple to implement the analytic continuation of kinematic parameters in a numerical evaluation , since they always appear in a factorized form , e.g. @xmath41 we need the analytic continuation of simple logarithms ; these are evaluated trivially in all kinematic regions : @xmath42 it is clear from the above example that we can derive a mellin - barnes representation for any integral starting from its feynman parameterization .",
    "the form of the parameterization depends on the choice of feynman parameters , the order in which the @xmath43 terms appear in the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep_multi ] , and the implementation of the delta function constraint for the feynman parameters .",
    "this arbitrariness is more pronounced beyond one - loop .    in section [ sec : tensors ] we will derive representations for tensor one - loop integrals which simplify their numerical evaluation .",
    "we aim to find similarly simple representations for multi - loop tensor integrals as well . for this purpose , it is convenient to use the one - loop representations as building blocks , by employing a re - insertion technique  @xcite .",
    "we explain this technique in our second example .",
    "we now derive a mellin - barnes representation for the massless planar double - box integral with two adjacent legs off - shell .",

    "for simplicity , we have set the powers of propagators to one .",
    "we perform , first , the @xmath46-loop integral and derive the representation for this integral reading it off from the one - loop result of eq .",

    "[ eq : box_2m_mb ] . the final result for the two - loop box with two adjacent legs",
    "off - shell is : @xmath52 we have produced a representation for a two - loop integral by embedding representations for one - loop integrals into other representations .",
    "it is obvious that we can use the re - insertion method for writing representations for arbitrary multi - loop integrals .",
    "representations for integrals with given kinematic scales can be used to derive , easily , results for simpler integrals where some of the scales are taken to zero .",
    "let us , for illustration , derive the representation for the double - box with one - leg off - shell and the on - shell double - box . we must first take the limit @xmath53 in eq .",
    "[ eq : dbox_2m_mb ] .",
    "the term @xmath54 is vanishing in this limit unless @xmath55 at the same time .",
    "if we use the cauchy theorem , we find that the wanted limit is given by taking the residue of the integrand at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the double - box with one - leg off - shell is : @xmath57 similarly , the on - shell double - box is given by : @xmath58 note that , in order to have a finite limit for a vanishing kinematic scale , the mellin - barnes representation should have terms in the integrand which behave as @xmath59 .",
    "these emerge naturally in non - trivial representations due to eq .",
    "[ eq : mbrep ] .",
    "in the previous section we have noted that the mellin - barnes representation of a loop integral is valid if appropriate poles of the gamma functions lay separated on the right and left of the integration contours .",
    "this condition guarantees the equivalence between the mellin - barnes integral and the original denominator in the loop integral .",
    "it often occurs that this condition can not be satisfied for values of the dimension parameter and the powers of the propagators which are relevant for a realistic application .",
    "let us consider , as an example , the one - loop box representation of eq .",
    "[ eq : box_2m_mb ] in the case of powers of propagators set to unity and the dimension in @xmath16 , @xmath60 this representation can only be valid for values of @xmath1 different from zero .",

    "we can use the cauchy theorem to obtain a representation in terms of a sum of contour integrals , which is valid at @xmath63 and the @xmath6 poles appear explicitly .",
    "the key point is that if the value of @xmath1 is chosen outside the allowed region , for example @xmath63 , some of the poles of the gamma functions will be on the wrong side of the contours ( see fig .  [",

    ", we must compare the position of the poles relative to the contours for values of @xmath1 inside the allowed region and the point outside . depending whether the poles crossed the contours from left or right , we should correct the representation by adding or subtracting the residue of the integrand on those poles .",
    "this simple observation can be easily cast into general purpose algorithms which extract the poles in @xmath1 of arbitrary mellin - barnes representations .    , and some of the poles cross to the other side of the contour . to recover a valid representation for the loop - integral",

    "we would like to recommend that the interested reader studies the pedagogical example of ref .",

    "the integrand of @xmath77 depends initially on gamma functions .",
    "the application of the analytic continuation algorithm requires the iterative evaluation of residues",
    ". these may also give rise to psi functions , which have poles in the same positions the gamma functions do , and are treated identically for the purposes of analytic continuation .",
    "the contours @xmath78 of the representation are straight lines parallel to the imaginary axis , and are chosen so that the real parts of the arguments of all gamma functions are positive .",
    "the same condition determines an allowed region for @xmath1 , which we will assume that includes the point @xmath79 . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we will consider the case @xmath80 , but the method proceeds analogously when @xmath81 .",
    "the first step is to find the maximum value @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , for which the representation holds . at this value ,",
    "one or some of the positions of the poles run into a contour .",
    "if the set of these poles , @xmath84 , is empty , i.e. no poles cross the contours when moving @xmath1 from @xmath85 to 0 , then the integral can be safely expanded around @xmath63 .",
    "so , let us focus on the more interesting case in which @xmath84 is non empty . here",
    "we have to distinguish between @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    if @xmath86 , at least one pole lies on the contours for the terminating value of @xmath1 .",
    "then , the representation has an unregulated singularity , and it is not feasible to perform an @xmath1 expansion and evaluate the contour integrals numerically .",
    "to remedy the situation we must change the contour of integration ; we use the cauchy theorem and displace one or more of the contours parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "then , we attempt afresh the analytic continuation ; the poles should now hit the contour at @xmath87 .",
    "if this does not happen , due to an unfortunate choice of the contour we displaced , we simply iterate the procedure until we succeed .    when @xmath88 , we have to determine the residues in the poles that cross the contour .",

    "let us look back at the specific example of the one - loop box . by applying the previous steps of the algorithm",
    ", we find that the first pole to cross a contour is at @xmath89 .",
    "we then choose one of the multiple integrals , e.g. the @xmath69 integral , and subtract the residue of the integrand on this pole , at @xmath90 , to the representation : @xmath91 the residue term in the above expression is a new multiple mellin - barnes integral with one integration variable less than in @xmath77 .",
    "in our example , the pole crosses the @xmath69 contour from the right side and we subtract its residue from the original representation .",

    "the algorithm is more complicated if many poles cross simultaneously the contour at @xmath82 . in our one - loop box example , if we had chosen a symmetric contour @xmath94 then we would have two poles crossing at the same time : @xmath95 .",
    "one way to deal with this situation is to displace the contours in such a way that the degeneracy is removed , i.e. introduce asymmetric contours from the beginning . another alternative is to take combined residues in all the poles . to correctly account for all the terms in this case",
    ", we can imagine that the contours are only slightly displaced from their current position .",
    "then the poles will hit them one at the time and we can take residues successively . finally , we can restore the original position of the contours without affecting the position of the poles .",
    "there is , however , a caveat in taking multiple residues .",
    "let us consider the case of the one - loop box , where the poles @xmath96 and @xmath97 hit the contour at the same time .",
    "we take residues in sequence , considering first @xmath98 .",
    "we make the `` unfortunate '' choice to take the residue on the @xmath99 integration variable , and not on @xmath68 .",
    "the analytic continuation yields : @xmath100 then we consider the crossing of the @xmath101 pole on each of the two terms on the right hand side of the above expression .",
    "we find no problems in taking the residue of the first term .",
    "however , the position of the @xmath101 pole for the second term is now written : @xmath102 the pole @xmath101 is now independent of @xmath1 and gets nailed to the contour .",
    "this situation is similar to the one we encountered for @xmath86 , and we can deal with it in exactly the same way by displacing the contours .",
    "we apply the algorithm recursively , to all the terms which are generated by adding the residues of crossing poles to the original parameterization . at the end of this procedure",
    ", we obtain a sum of contour integrals plus some terms that do not contain any remaining integral due to taking residues on all integration variables .",

    "we then perform the analytic continuation of section  [ sec : analytic ] , and we expand the integrands in powers of @xmath1 using maple and mathematica . as the next step , we translate the integrands into fortran routines which evaluate them as complex quantities .",
    "there are many options to calculate numerically the sum of the mellin - barnes integrals which emerge from the routines for the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "for example , we can combine all contributions in a single common integrand , so that large numerical cancellations take place before integration .",
    "however , the finding of the peaks and the adaptation of the integration routines become less efficient . following a diametric approach",
    ", we could integrate all components separately and compute their sum at the end .",
    "then , the adaptation of the numerical integration is optimal , however , the numerical precision is sensitive to cancellations . in practice , we follow a hybrid approach and group together integrals with equivalent contours .",
    "we have achieved a reasonable efficiency and speed for all the computations that we present in this paper .",
    "since we aim to keep our integration method general , we do not attempt any special simplifications by , for example , applying barnes lemmas or exploiting symmetries of particular contours .",
    "for the numerical integration , we maintain the contours as straight lines parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "we map them onto a real interval with a simple transformation , @xmath137 in all cases that we have considered , the integrands vanish rapidly when the integration variables take values away from the real line @xmath138 .",

    "we perform the multidimensional integrations using the cuhre and vegas routines of the cuba library  @xcite . to gain some speed",
    ", we integrate the real and imaginary parts of the integrals concurrently , using the same grid .",
    "the grid is adapted to the peaks of the real part , however , the quality of the integration for the imaginary part is only mildly affected . on the other hand",
    ", there is another subtle point concerning the convergence of the imaginary parts . as they always start an order later in the expansion in @xmath1 , the analytic expressions for them would be simpler than the corresponding real ones .",
    "when integrating numerically this relative simplicity is reflected by a faster convergence when compared to the real pieces at the same order .",
    "the numerical results depend on the values for the kinematic scales of the integrals . with our approach",
    ", we use the same expressions for the evaluation of the integrals in all kinematic regions . as we explained earlier ,",
    "the only analytic continuations in kinematic variables that we must perform , is for simple functions of the type @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "these are implemented trivially , in a branched format , in numerical programs . in this paper , we present multi - loop integrals for fixed kinematic parameters .",
    "however , we have arranged our routines so that a numerical integration over the phase - space can be performed simultaneously with the mellin - barnes integrations .",
    "a problematic case for our numerical algorithms is the evaluation of loop integrals with massive internal propagators in non - euclidean kinematic regions .",
    "typically , mellin - barnes represenations for such integrals exhibit a very slow damping at @xmath141 in physical regions .",
    "the mapping of the integration region to a finite interval that we have considered in eq .",
    "[ eq : mapping ] is not adequate , and contour deformations together with more sophisticated algorithms for the evaluation of oscillatory integrals are required .",
    "we defer the study of such situations for a future project .",
    "we have achieved a full automatization of the code generation for the numerical evaluation .",
    "this has allowed us to apply our method to diverse problems .",
    "our approach can be improved and refined further in the future by considering , for example , a clever analysis of the terms before integration in order to avoid numerical cancellations or more sophisticated mappings which can smoothen the peak structure of the integrands . however , as we will see in the rest of the paper , our first , naive , implementation is already sufficient to obtain accurate results for complicated integrals in a reasonable time .    in what follows we present results for one , two , and three loop integrals .",
    "some of the integrals are known analytically , and we use them to verify our numerical programs",
    ". we also present new loop integrals , which would be extremely tedious to calculate with traditional methods .",
    "in this section we present results for one , two , and three - loop integrals that we obtain with our method . for each integral , we present the coefficients of its expansion in @xmath142 through the finite term : @xmath143 where @xmath116 is the depth of the leading pole in @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the errors associated with our results for @xmath144 , by adding , in quadrature , the integration errors of all contributions from the residue decomposition .",
    "the first integral we consider is the massless one - loop hexagon , depicted in figure [ fig : hexagon ] .        for massless external legs ,",
    "we derive an eight - dimensional mellin - barnes representation for this integral . due to the high dimensionality",
    ", the analytic continuation in @xmath1 involves the crossing of the contours of integration from many poles , and the mellin - barnes expression after the continuation consists of about two hundred terms .",
    "this example demonstrates the advantage of the automatic algorithm we described in section [ sec : analytic ] , since the book - keeping is done automatically and our routines perform the @xmath1 expansion in fractions of a minute .    after the analytic continuation and the expansion in series of @xmath1 , only integrals with low dimensionality contribute to the poles and finite pieces of the series .",
    "the integration over feynman parameters produces a denominator factor @xmath145 , which contributes factors of @xmath1 in the series expansion .",
    "the eight - dimensional component , in which no residues have been taken , drops out from the finite part .",
    "in addition , most of the residues in the analytic continuation do not give rise to poles in @xmath1 ; a few components only develop a singularity that compensates the @xmath1 in the overall factor . for the scalar hexagon",
    ", we find integrals with up to three dimensions which contribute to the poles and the finite term .",

    "in this paper , we have introduced a new method for the numerical evaluation of arbitrary loop integrals .",
    "we first derive mellin - barnes representations by either decomposing directly the feynman representation , or by using one - loop representations as building blocks for representations of multi - loop integrals . for a given representation ,",
    "we find values of the space - time dimension and the powers of the propagators which yield a well defined representation .",
    "then we use automated programs to perform the analytic continuation to values of the parameters for which the integral may develop divergences .",
    "finally , we expand in @xmath1 and compute the integral coefficients of the expansion numerically .",
    "the method is based on the earlier work of smirnov  @xcite and tausk  @xcite .",
    "the novel features in our publication are : ( i ) the automation of the procedure for the @xmath1 expansion , ( ii ) the numerical evaluation of the coefficients of the expansion , avoiding cumbersome summations of multiple infinite series and the analytic continuation in the arguments of polylogarithms , ( iii ) and the efficient generalization of the method to tensor integrals .",
    "we believe that these new features render our method suitable for the practical evaluation of multi - loop amplitudes in gauge theories .    we have performed a number of explicit calculations to verify our algorithms and demonstrate the power of our method .",
    "we first recalculated complicated loop integrals which are only recently known in the literature .",
    "namely , we evaluated the planar and cross on - shell double boxes , the planar double - box with one leg off - shell , and the triple planar box with on - shell legs . in all cases ,",
    "we have found an excellent agreement between our numerical results and the known analytic results .",
    "the analytic results require complicated analytic continuations of polylogarithms to non - euclidean kinematic regions . with our method",
    ", we were able to compute the integrals in all kinematic regions effortlessly .    in this paper",
    ", we have presented results for loop - integrals which were previously unknown . at two - loops ,",
    "we have computed the double - box integral with two adjacent legs off - shell for independent external mass - parameters .",
    "this is one of the most complicated two - loop box integrals that enters the evaluation of two - loop amplitudes for heavy boson pair production at colliders . at three - loops , we have computed the planar triple - box with one off - shell leg ; this integral emerges in @xmath168 , or the production of a single heavy boson in association with a jet at hadron colliders at nnnlo in qcd . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it is the first time that a two - loop box with four kinematic scales or a three - loop box with three scales are ever computed in all physical regions .",
    "many processes with six external legs are particularly important at the lhc . at present",
    ", there has been no nlo calculation of a cross - section for a hadron collider process with six external states , due to the lack of efficient methods for evaluating loop amplitudes . in this paper",
    ", we applied our method to the evaluation of tensors through rank six for the hexagon topology .",
    "the purpose of this application was two - fold ; first , we wanted to demonstrate that we were able to extend the method to tensor integrals economically , and second , to setup programs that are efficient for the evaluation of multi - scale one - loop amplitudes ( e.g. six parton qcd amplitudes ) .",
    "we have found that the evaluation of the tensor integrals is not significantly more complicated than the scalar integral .",
    "the programs that we developed can be immediately used for the evaluation of the six parton one - loop qcd amplitudes .",
    "our technical goals for the current study were to build the necessary programs , implement an efficient book - keeping platform , and to examine the scaling of computing intensity in applications with diverse features .",
    "we anticipate that our method can be improved and generalized even further , when we consider issues that were only briefly examined in this first study .",
    "for example , in preliminary investigations , we have found that it is possible to exploit further the cauchy theorem . if we specify a kinematic region , it turns out that some of the numerical integrals can be approximated very accurately by the sum of a finite number of residues .",
    "we expect that we can improve substantially our efficiency if we replace some of the integrations which involve kinematic scales with appropriate finite sums of such residues .",
    "in addition , we are investigating hybrid approaches , combining our method with ideas in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the applications of our method are numerous .",
    "we believe that it will be particularly useful for precision calculations of observables in collider physics .",
    "we plan to apply our techniques to key nlo and nnlo calculations for the lhc and to answer more formal questions on the perturbative behavior of gauge theories in the near future .",
    "we are indebted to vladimir smirnov , bas tausk , simon schwarz and jeppe andersen for extensive discussions on the topic .",
    "we would like to thank aude gehrmann - de ridder , thomas gehrmann , gudrun heinrich , zoltan kunszt , zoltan nagy , and bas tausk for their suggestions and for reading the manuscript .",
