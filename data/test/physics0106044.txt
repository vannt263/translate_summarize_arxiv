    "such a kick can still be considered a small perturbation to the ground state configuration because only a fraction @xmath63 of the total electron density was freed ( corresponding to an ionization probability of @xmath64 for the outermost electron ) .",

    "on the right - hand - side the corresponding spectrum is plotted , obtained by fourier - transforming the dipoles of the individual ks orbitals .",

    "the right one clearly identifies rather narrow vertical lines .",
    "each of those vertical lines can be understood as a single particle transition between ground state ks levels . for a certain ks orbital",
    "the dipole strength is particularly high for those transitions where one of the two levels involved is the one which is occupied in the ground state configuration of this ks orbital .",
    "this explains the parabola - like structures of strong dipole emission visible in the ksord spectra .",
    "the low frequency lines in the range 05ev stem from transitions of the type @xmath65 with the @xmath66-quantum number fixed .",
    "lines between 5 and 15ev are caused by transitions of type @xmath67 , and are therefore particularly pronounced for orbitals representing @xmath30-electrons initially .",
    "the lines with high dipole strength along a parabola - like structure around 20ev for both , @xmath30- and @xmath7-electrons originate from transitions of the type @xmath68 or @xmath69 ( right branches ) and @xmath70 or @xmath71 ( left branches ) .",
    "even higher dipole emission around 30ev stems from @xmath72-transitions . a common feature for all orbitals where @xmath73 initially ( i.e. , orbitals number 0 , 2 , 5 , 9 , 14 , 20 , 27 , 35 , 44 , 54 , 55 , 57 , 60 , 64 , 69 ) is the relatively strong emission around 30ev .",
    "the reason why the @xmath73-orbitals preferably radiate at those frequencies is that @xmath74-transitions are not possible for them .",
    "indeed , the left branch of the parabola - like structure for the @xmath7-electrons ( related to transitions where the @xmath17 quantum number decreases by one ) shows gaps for the @xmath73 orbitals whereas for the @xmath30 electrons it is the right branch where the corresponding lines are missing .",
    "the spectrum of the total dipole is shown above the contour plot .",
    "it is a broad structure fragmented in lines originating from single particle transitions . around 20ev",
    "there is a minimum in the total spectrum although the ksord spectra show lines there .",
    "this is due to destructive interference . instead , the dipole emission from ks orbitals with ( initially ) high @xmath17 quantum number at 17 and 24ev interferes constructively , leading to two pronounced peaks in the total dipole spectrum .",
    "the small zero frequency component is caused by the few electron density which was freed by the delta - kick .",
    "the dipole spectrum in fig.[kickksord ] can be compared with the linear response results in @xcite ( fig.3 ) and in @xcite ( fig.1 ) . in ref.@xcite where a similar jellium model was studied within linear response theory",
    "we find similarities with our spectrum in the energy region 1420ev , in particular the pronounced 17ev - line .",
    "instead , in fig.3 of @xcite there is weak dipole emission below 10ev ( apart from a peak at 4ev ) and also low dipole strength above 25ev , apart from a broad but rather weak hump with a maximum around 34ev . in our spectrum in fig.[kickksord ] lines in the region 2535ev are much stronger because also transitions which are not directly accessible by single particle processes starting from the ground state configuration are allowed in the nonlinear treatment . similar to our result , in fig.1a of ref.@xcite a highly fragmented structure is visible in the particle - hole strength function for energies 415ev .",
    "we calculated the interaction of our jellium model with ten cycle sin@xmath75-shaped ( with respect to the electric field ) laser pulses in the frequency range from 6.8 up to 47.6ev .",
    "the peak intensity was adjusted in such a way that intensity times pulse duration ( energy per unit area ) was held constant , i.e. , in atomic units @xmath76 where @xmath13 is the incident laser frequency and @xmath77 is the vector potential amplitude . with such laser intensities",
    "the probability to remove the first electron remained below 10% for all frequencies .",
    "after the laser pulse was over we continued the propagation of all ks orbitals to allow for delayed ionization and free oscillations .",
    "the total simulation time corresponded to @xmath78fs so that a real c@xmath0 which has been ionized at most to c@xmath79 has no time for fragmentation . the result is presented in fig .  [ spekafterone ] .",
    "the contour plot shows the logarithmically scaled dipole strength vs.  incident frequency @xmath13 and emitted frequency @xmath80 . left to the contour plot the number of removed electrons @xmath81 is plotted as a function of the incident frequency @xmath13 . in all cases",
    "delayed ionization was negligible compared to the electron density which was freed owing to the laser pulse .",
    "the maximum dipole strength is along the diagonal @xmath82 where the excitation was resonant .",
    "however , at @xmath83ev there is a relatively weak dipole response but the ionization yield has a local maximum ( dashed line ) .",
    "instead , the local minima in ionization at 17 and 24ev coincide with emission in two strong lines near the same values for @xmath80 .",
    "those lines were already observed in section [ dipresp ] . for @xmath84ev",
    "one observes both , strong ionization _ and _ a strong dipole response . for even higher @xmath13 ionization drops and the jellium system does not provide modes",
    "@xmath85ev .",
    "the mutually exclusive behavior of ionization and dipole emission at 17 , 20.5 , and 24ev might be surprising .",
    "one could expect that resonantly driven transitions yield big excursions of the electron density , thus leading to strong ionization also .",
    "this was observed for the case of sodium clusters interacting with strong laser pulses of 100fs duration @xcite , and also the experimental results in @xcite were analyzed by unfolding excitation and ( subsequent ) autoionization .",
    "we believe that our different findings are due to the short duration of the exciting laser pulse .",
    "although at 17 and 24ev the short laser pulse excites resonantly @xmath86-transitions with the outermost electron involved it does not efficiently couple those excitations to the continuum , thus keeping the ionization probability relatively low . instead , at 20.5ev the outer electron is not resonantly coupled to another _ bound _ state but rather absorbs a single photon to make a bound - free transition .",
    "the transitions that are resonant with the incident frequency of 20.5ev involve low-@xmath17 @xmath7- and @xmath30-orbitals whose emitted radiation interfere destructively , as discussed already in section [ dipresp ] . at 30ev",
    "the outer electron can be freed by absorbing a single photon while stronger bound electrons are resonantly excited to perform bound - bound transitions of @xmath72-type which leads to efficient dipole emission also . concluding this section we can say that in very short exciting laser pulses the c@xmath0 response seems dominated ( i ) by single particle transitions , although not exclusively those starting from the ground state , and ( ii ) by _ direct _ photoionization instead of ionization by resonantly driven single particle transitions or plasmons , as it is the case in longer pulses .",
    "after studying the dipole response at relatively high energies we now turn to the interaction of c@xmath0 with laser light of 800 nm wavelength .",
    "we simulated the interaction of our c@xmath0 jellium model with a ten cycle 800 nm sin@xmath75-shaped laser pulses ( corresponding to 26fs pulse duration ) . in fig .",
    "[ slope ] the removed electron density @xmath88 after the pulse vs.  the peak intensity of the pulse is presented . in the regime",
    "where @xmath89 this is equivalent to the single ionization probability . in the case of perturbative off - resonant multiphoton ionization of atoms",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the ionization probability is @xmath90 where @xmath66 is the number of photons needed to reach the continuum from the initial state . from section [ model ]",
    "we know that in our jellium model the first ionization potential is @xmath51 , and thus we expect @xmath91 photons necessary for ionization if c@xmath0 behaves multiphoton - like . as is evident from fig .  [ slope ]",
    "this is the case , in agreement with an experiment performed using a ti sapphire laser ( @xmath87 nm , 30 to 120fs pulse duration ) @xcite .",
    "there , from the c@xmath92 yield - slope , also the second electron was found to behave multiphoton - like with @xmath93 .",
    "those findings are in contrast with earlier experimental results in @xcite ( same wavelength and pulse durations ) where excitation of the 20ev mie - resonance , corresponding to @xmath94 photons , was concluded to be the dominant ionization mechanism .",
    "the @xmath94 slope is depicted in fig .",
    "[ slope ] in the upper left corner and is much too steep to fit with our numerical result .",
    "this appears reasonable because the incident laser frequency 1.6ev lies energetically far below 20ev so that in short pulses an efficient excitation of the latter is unlikely .",

    "fourier - transforming only over the time after the pulse leads to the gray curves .",

    "the dominant lines in the total dipole spectrum at 17 and 24ev were found to originate from single particle @xmath98-transitions with high-@xmath17 ks orbitals involved .",
    "we also found a strong response in the dipole spectra around 30ev .",
    "this broad structure is fragmented in single particle transitions of @xmath72-type .    for short exciting pulses with frequencies between 7 and 48ev we studied both ionization and the dipole spectra , calculated from the nonlinear dipole response after the pulse had passed by .",
    "we observed that when the incident frequency matched with the two resonant peaks of the dipole spectrum at 17 and 24ev , respectively , ionization dropped .",
    "instead , an incident frequency in between ( @xmath99ev ) led to a maximum ion yield .",
    "this was attributed to the fact that in very short exciting laser pulses the c@xmath0 response is dominated by direct photoionization instead of by ionization due to resonantly driven single particle transitions or plasmons .",
    "hence , when the outermost electron is coupled resonantly to another _ bound _ state ionization decreases . a maximum in both ionization yield and dipole strength",
    "was found at frequencies around 31ev where the outer @xmath30 electron is directly photoionized and stronger bound electrons are resonantly excited . for even higher incident photon energies",
    "@xmath100ev ionization decreased because energy transfer to the c@xmath0 became inefficient .    for 800 nm fs laser pulses we observed direct multiphoton ionization rather than ionization via excitation of a `` mie - resonance '' .",
    "this result agrees with recent experimental findings in @xcite .",
    "although it disagrees with earlier results in @xcite we are quite confident that our model yields correct predictions in this respect because the multiphoton character for optical ( or near optical ) frequencies is well - known for metal clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) where collective electron behavior is more pronounced and resonances are less energetic .",
    "the tddft jellium model offers one of the very few feasible approaches for theoretical investigations concerning the interaction of intense laser light with complex systems where many electron - effects , bound - free transitions , and rescattering might be important .",
    "preliminary results for `` above threshold ionization '' ( ati ) of c@xmath0 ( as in the experiment @xcite ) were also obtained within this model @xcite .",
    "simulating ati is always much more demanding than studying the dipole response and ionization only since one has to trace the free electron motion in the continuum as well as rescattering events with very high accuracy over several laser cycles of optical frequency .",
