    "post - main - sequence mass loss affects both present and future generations of stars .",
    "it determines the remnant state of stars of intermediate mass and below , as well as affecting the state and contents of the interstellar medium out of which new stars are formed . however , the rate and amount of mass lost by red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is a major uncertainty in stellar evolutionary theory .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite point out , existing formulations rely on empirical laws based on observations of population  i stars .",
    "there is little theoretical guidance on how mass loss should be included in stellar evolutionary models , or on how it affects population synthesis models based on the stellar models .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) have long been the prime testing grounds for stellar evolution theory . with large populations of low - mass stars of the same age , metallicity , and distance",
    ", they should be ideal places to test ideas about mass loss .",
    "there are several observational confirmations of the theoretical prediction that stars more massive than @xmath2 lose a significant fraction of their mass after leaving the main sequence .",
    "these include initial - final mass estimates of white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and evidence from line profiles of red giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to explain the horizontal branch it was argued ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that much of this mass is shed on the rgb , but as agb stars , post - agb stars , and pne are also observed in gcs @xcite some mass must be lost on the agb as well .",
    "there is also ample observational evidence that many gcs have stars which are currently losing mass , at rates of @xmath3  yr@xmath4 @xcite . from these observations",
    "it is difficult to obtain an overall picture of time - averaged mass loss rates and duty cycles and their relation to cluster properties such as metallicity , since only a few stars at a time lose mass .",
    "a more global picture of mass loss within gcs might be provided by the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "mass lost from gc stars is expected to accumulate in the icm until the cluster passes through the galactic disk , when the icm will be stripped by ram pressure .",
    "the icm is expected to be mostly gaseous ( although the ionization state is unknown ) , with a small amount of dust formed in the extended atmospheres of red giants .",
    "the dust should be optically thin and heated by starlight to 5080  k @xcite ; its thermal emission should peak in the mid - to - far - infrared ( ir ) and could be detected as an ir excess at these wavelengths .",
    "although gc stars are clearly losing mass , detections of the icm have been surprisingly difficult .",
    "searches for intra - cluster gas have been conducted for several decades @xcite ; searches for dust @xcite are more recent but have yielded similar results , mostly upper limits .",
    "only one galactic gc , ( m15 ) , shows clear evidence for an infrared ( ir ) excess @xcite .",
    "diffuse infrared emission near may be associated with the cluster or with galactic cirrus , while has an infrared point source which may be intracluster dust @xcite . an additional cluster , , has a tentative detection of dust at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "all of the detections imply dust masses well below the expected levels .",

    "the target list ( table  [ tab : targets ] ) comprises the milky way globular clusters that we believed to be the best candidates for icm dust detection .",
    "these clusters are reasonably nearby , at high galactic latitude ( to reduce confusing fore- and back - grounds ) , and have high escape velocities .",
    "they are among the most massive galactic gcs .",
    "more massive clusters are more likely to harbor a larger number of stars in the short - lived superwind phase : if the icm is being removed from the cluster on short time scales , then we are more likely to see it in a more massive cluster where the icm material is being replenished more quickly .",
    "clusters with escape velocities that are much larger than agb wind speeds ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 ) will also be more likely to retain icm material . at the time this program was planned , all had existing or scheduled _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir observations with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "observing clusters with a range of times since last disk passage is desirable , but we did not use this as a selection criterion because orbital information is only available for a fraction of milky way globular clusters ( e.g. , from * ? ? ?",
    "the clusters span a factor of thirty in metallicity ( 1.5  dex ) , important for testing the effects of metallicity on dust production and retention .",
    "all of the clusters are detected with iras @xcite , and both ngc  104 ( 47 tuc ) and ngc  362 contain stars with known circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "irac photometry traces the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectral energy distribution of globular cluster stars .",
    "although cold intracluster dust is not expected to radiate at irac wavelengths , understanding the near - ir sed is very useful for quantifying any ir excess from the dust .",

    "the results are given in table  [ tab : iracphot ] , with electronic links to the observational data .",
    "the uncertainties in the flux densities due to poisson noise from the cluster and sky background noise are very small ( @xmath9% ) ; uncertainties in the absolute ( a few percent ; * ? ? ?",

    "the mid - ir centers are given in table  [ tab : mipsphot ] .",
    "compared to the irac data , the choice of aperture for the mips images is less obvious : the intracluster medium seems more likely to sink to the center of the cluster potential well than to follow the same spatial distribution as the cluster stars .",

    "confusion noise due to extragalactic sources is not expected to affect these observations : @xcite derived the 70  @xmath0 m  confusion limit due to extragalactic sources as 0.3  mjy , well below the flux regime of the observations presented here .",
    "confusion due to galactic cirrus , however , is an issue : @xcite computed the mips 70  @xmath0 m  point source detection limits due to galactic cirrus confusion at the latitudes of our clusters ( @xmath21 ) as @xmath22  mjy , again below our detection limits . for larger apertures , however , the confusion noise and detection limits scale as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the aperture size and @xmath25 is the cirrus power spectrum index .",

    "we expected that any icm dust would likely be too cool to be detectable at 24  @xmath0 m ; however , circumstellar dust should be warmer and possibly detected at this wavelength .",
    "all of the 24  @xmath0 m  flux densities are within 20% of the prediction ; six clusters are within 10% .",
    "this is reasonable accuracy considering the difficulties in deriving integrated measurements of these resolved objects .",
    "the non - detection of 24  @xmath0 m  excesses in integrated photometry may simply reflect the small number of mass - losing agb stars compared to the bulk of the population .",
    "point - spread - fitting photometry of the 24  @xmath0 m  images , while beyond the scope of this work , may reveal which stars are surrounded by circumstellar dust .",
    "seven of the eight clusters in the sample have measurements or upper limits on 70  @xmath0 m  flux that are more than a factor of 2 above the black - body prediction .",
    "the exception is ngc  104 , for which the 70  @xmath0 m  upper limit is _ lower _ than the predicted photospheric value .",
    "the problem could be background subtraction : the half - light radius is almost as large as the 70  @xmath0 m  image and a `` background '' region is difficult to define .      figures  [ fig : seds ] and [ fig : mips_compare ] clearly demonstrate that only one of the clusters in our sample ",
    "ngc  6341has a significant infrared excess . to quantify this",
    ", we computed ( limits on ) the 70  @xmath0 m  non - stellar emission in both the half - light and core apertures . to compute the non - stellar emission in the half - light aperture",

    "thus the non - stellar emission at 70  @xmath0 m  in the half - light radius is @xmath31 the fraction of stellar emission contained within the core aperture is not as straightforward to compute ; to estimate it , we scale the flux measured at 24  @xmath0 m  in the core aperture ( recall that the image used to measure this flux was convolved to the 70  @xmath0 m  resolution ) by the ratios of the predicted total fluxes at 70 and 24  @xmath0 m",

    "figure  [ fig : images70 ] shows that the apparent 70  @xmath0 m  emission in this cluster comes from an extended region offset from the cluster core by roughly 43  arcsec , or about @xmath33 . within the emission region",
    "there are three separate peaks which contain about 60% of the total flux ; it is unclear whether these peaks are separate point sources ( none has a co - located 24  @xmath0 m  source ) or merely represent structure in the emission . in comparison ,",
    "the dust emission detected in ngc  7078 by @xcite is much rounder and is located closer to the center of that cluster ( @xmath34 ) ; however , the possible dust cloud in ngc  5024 detected by @xcite is also far from the cluster center , at @xmath35 .",
    "the iris 60  @xmath0 m  sky maps do show some nebulosity near ngc  6341 , so it is possible that the detected flux is in fact not associated with the cluster ; however ngc  1851 , at a similar galactic latitude , also has some nearby nebulosity and does not have a 70  @xmath0 m  detection .",
    "future data from the akari all - sky survey should have sufficient spatial resolution to address the issue of whether there is diffuse emission near ngc  6341 .",
    "the lack of any excess infrared emission in the 90  @xmath0 m  akari observations of ngc  6341 by @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : seds ] ) casts doubt on the reality of our low - significance detection ; however , we retain it for analysis in the remainder of this paper .",
    "while only some of the clusters have spatially diffuse ir emission within @xmath30 , all of the 70  @xmath0 m  images except those of ngc  104 and ngc  5904 do contain some faint point sources which are not concentrated toward the cluster centers .",

    "we did not attempt irac photometry for the 70  @xmath0 m  sources : the irac images of the gcs are significantly more crowded , and we were doubtful about the reliability of measurements in these regions .",

    "various estimates of the dust mass within a globular cluster are possible , but little detailed modeling has been done with the exception of the work of @xcite .",
    "those authors combined dynamical models of star clusters with radiative transfer models to predict dust grain temperatures and luminosities for a few individual clusters , given the presence of @xmath72 of dust . while it would be valuable to repeat such modeling with modern radiative transfer codes and understanding of dust properties , for present purposes a simpler estimate of globular cluster dust content will suffice .",

    "the last factor scales for the change in gas - to - dust ratio with metallicity .",
    "values for @xmath75 are listed in table  [ tab : targets ] ; for the two clusters not listed by @xcite we assume a lower limit of @xmath79  yr . to estimate @xmath76 we use the ` specific evolutionary flux ' method of @xcite",

    "for one cluster , we can compare this dust mass estimate to the current dust production rate : @xcite have recently used _",

    "when multiplied by @xmath88  yr , this yields a total dust content of @xmath89 , about twice that predicted from eq .",

    "the observations of @xcite are likely to be affected by blending ; correcting for this would lower the inferred dust mass to a value closer to the prediction .",
    "even without such a correction , the comparison gives us confidence that the dust mass predictions are of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : dustpred ] compares the predicted and observed dust masses and upper limits . to augment our sample we analyse additional clusters observed by other groups : @xcite , @xcite , and ngc  7078 @xcite , and the six other clusters observed by @xcite : , , , , and .",
    "where several values for dust mass or upper limits are given in published works , only the one with assumed dust temperature closest to 70  k is used .",
    "all of our measurements are well below the predicted values ; for most clusters the disagreement is more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the same is true for clusters observed by other groups , in that only two clusters have the inferred dust mass close to the predicted value : ngc  6356 @xcite ( only for specific assumptions about the dust distribution ) , and ngc  5634 @xcite , one of the lowest - mass , lowest - metallicity clusters shown .",
    "while assuming a lower dust temperature or higher absorption coefficient would increase the dust masses inferred from the observations , it seems unlikely that this can explain the three order of magnitude discrepancy for clusters such as ngc  5272 .",
    "the other explanation is that one or more of the assumptions involved in eq .",
    "[ eq : dustpred ] is incorrect : what if globular cluster stars lose much less than @xmath90 on average , the number of horizontal branch stars does not scale with @xmath91 , the dust - to - gas ratio does not scale with metallicity , or the dust is removed from clusters on a timescale much shorter than the disk passage time @xmath75 ? direct observations of red giant mass loss and color - magnitude diagram modeling are consistent with mass losses of approximately @xmath90 @xcite , and the scaling of @xmath76 with @xmath91 is well - grounded in stellar evolutionary theory .",
    "we address the remaining factors below .    with a small sample of clusters , and an even smaller number of low - significance detections ,",
    "deriving conclusions about the effects of gc properties on mass loss is difficult .",

    "( in this and the following figure , we plot the more stringent dust mass limits of @xcite for the five clusters in common with our sample . )",
    "there are no clear correlations : while the clusters with large inferred dust masses tend to have large @xmath75 , consistent with the expectation that intracluster dust builds up between cluster passage through the disk , other clusters with similar values of @xmath75 have much smaller inferred masses .",
    "this agrees with the finding of @xcite that the icm dust in ngc  7078 must have been collecting for a time @xmath93 , and with the computation by @xcite that cluster dust lifetimes @xmath94 .",
    "the clusters with dust detections do not have the highest central escape velocities , suggesting that possession of a deep potential well is not in itself enough to guarantee the presence of an icm .",
    "the clusters cover a relatively small range in bolometric luminosity ; this parameter does not seem to have a strong effect on inferred dust mass .",
    "how does metallicity relate to intracluster dust ? the two clusters with the largest inferred dust masses ( ngc  7078 and ngc  6356 ) have the lowest and highest metallicities in the sample .",
    "ngc  5024 , with a tentative dust detection , also has a low metallicity .",
    "the globular cluster data do not help to clarify the controversy over the connection between metallicity and dust production : while some studies show that metallicity and mass loss are not correlated in carbon - rich agb stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite , others find that metal - poor carbon stars , like oxygen - rich giants , form less dust @xcite .",
    "the clusters considered here are almost all more metal - poor than the magellanic clouds , so their agb stars are expected to be oxygen , rather than carbon - rich ; however the effects ( if any ) of metallicity on dust mass loss are not evident from the present data .",
    "observations of mass - losing stars within gcs show that mass loss is occurring at roughly the expected rate , so the non - detection of the icm means that it must somehow be removed .",
    "one possible mechanism is ram - pressure stripping of the cluster icm by the galactic halo .",
    "support for this mechanism is provided by detections of diffuse x  ray emission near several galactic globular clusters @xcite ; @xcite show that the temperature and luminosity of the diffuse emission is consistent with it arising from stripped intracluster gas , and that the energetics require nearly all of the cluster gas to be removed .",
    "those authors also state , to show diffuse x  ray emission , a cluster should have a velocity relative to the galactic halo @xmath95  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we computed @xmath96 for our sample clusters from the space velocities given in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite assuming a non - rotating halo ; these are plotted against dust masses and limits in the left panel of figure  [ fig : dust_remove ] .",
    "the high velocities of both ngc  7078 and ngc  5024 appear to be problematic for halo stripping ; a measurement of the space velocity of ngc  6356 might help to clarify the situation .",
    "there is certainly no evidence that clusters with low @xmath96 have more dust ; however , the correlation of cluster kinematics with metallicity combined with any dependence on metallicity of the dust mass limits may also confuse the issue .",
    "another possible icm removal mechanism is kinetic energy injected by stellar collisions , as proposed by @xcite for m15 .",
    "those authors use an n - body model to estimate the time between collisions in the cluster core ; their result is of the same order of magnitude as a less - sophisticated estimate based on eq .",
    "8 - 125 of @xcite : @xmath97 \\frac{\\sigma_c}{\\rho_0 ^ 2 r_c^3}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the number of stars within the cluster core ( of radius @xmath99  pc ) , @xmath100 is the central velocity dispersion in km  s@xmath4 , and @xmath101 is the central mass density in @xmath102  pc@xmath103 . using the values for @xmath99 , @xmath101 , and @xmath104 , from from king - model fits given in @xcite , we computed @xmath105 for each cluster in the sample ; it is plotted against @xmath59 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dust_remove ] .",
    "again , there is no clear correlation of the time between collisions and dust masses : while both ngc  6356 and ngc  5024 have long @xmath106 , so do many other clusters .",
    "ngc  7078 is core - collapsed and should have a short central collision time . we conclude that neither ram pressure stripping and stellar collisions as the cause of icm removal can be ruled out by the current data .",
    "the intracluster medium of globular clusters remains elusive .",
    "our sample comprised eight galactic globular clusters thought to have the best chance for retaining an intracluster medium .",
    "no significant extended emission is detected from seven of the eight target clusters : any such emission may well be hidden underneath confusion noise from galactic cirrus .",
    "one cluster , ngc  6341 , has tentative evidence for excess ir emission from cool dust , although the lack of a 90  @xmath0 m  excess casts doubt on the detection .",
    "all of our inferred dust masses and upper limits are @xmath107 , compared to predicted dust masses ranging from @xmath108 for the same clusters .",
    "searches for intracluster gas have been similarly unsuccessful ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of intracluster dust and gas implies that either ( 1 ) evolved stars in globular clusters make less dust than predicted , or ( 2 ) the icm escapes from the clusters more quickly than expected .",
    "the first possibility seems unlikely because of the evidence to the contrary in both ngc  7078 and ngc  5139 , where two of the three dustiest , most mass - losing stars have @xmath78 } < -2.0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that icm escape is not just a trivial occurrence in the life of a globular cluster : substantial mass loss over a gc s history could affect its dynamical evolution and perhaps even its survival as a bound system @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms for icm escape have been discussed above , with energy injected by stellar collisions perhaps being favored over ram pressure from galactic halo gas .",
    "stellar winds provide another possible mechanism ; giant stars with wind velocities above the escape velocity of a typical cluster have been observed @xcite . while there is observational evidence that metallicity does not strongly affect the mass loss rate of individual stars @xcite , stellar wind velocities do appear to scale with metallicity @xcite .",
    "faster winds in agb stars in metal - rich clusters could therefore increase the rate at which the icm is driven out of the cluster .",
    "the existing small sample of clusters does not permit us to distinguish between the possibilities for icm removal .",
    "decades of searching have yielded few detections of the elusive globular cluster icm . a possible strategy for future observations hoping to detect",
    "the icm is to study the removal mechanisms in detail and identify those clusters most likely to retain some icm",
    ". observations of distant clusters which have had few interactions with the milky way could place limits on the importance of halo stripping , although the larger distance of such clusters reduces the effective sensitivity . while infrared facilities available in the near future will not greatly improve on the sensitivity of _ spitzer",
    "_ , observing a larger sample of clusters would allow a more thorough exploration of the dust content as a function of cluster properties .",
    "observations with future radio facilities such as the square kilometer array will place more stringent limits on the gas content . together with more sophisticated modeling efforts and detailed examination of mass loss in individual cluster stars , a multi - wavelength observational approach provides the best chance for finding and explaining the elusive intracluster medium in globular clusters .      we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and helpful comments and r.t .",
