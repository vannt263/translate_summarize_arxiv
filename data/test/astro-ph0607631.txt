    "the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs : @xcite ) and the main galaxy sample @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) , have provided detailed maps of the local structure from hundreds of thousands of galaxies of all types at a mean redshift of @xmath4 , while the sdss is also generating a large sample of more distant luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the present paper describes a new survey which combines the precision of the sdss photometric survey with the spectroscopic capabilities of the two - degree field instrument ( 2df ) on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , to extend the lrg survey from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "lrgs constitute ideal tracers of large - scale structure at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath8 ) because they are intrinsically luminous and spectroscopically homogeneous , and can be reliably identified photometrically .",
    "lrgs are strongly clustered , with a bias towards high density regions in ways that are believed to be well understood .",
    "the shift in the focus of observational cosmology from determining cosmological parameters to attempting to constrain galaxy evolution and formation has accelerated over the past decade , especially since the release of the first wmap results @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic information extracted from the 2dfgrs and sdss has provided important clues as to the nature of galaxies in the local universe and their recent history @xcite .",
    "although galaxies are generally believed to form hierarchically through a succession of mergers , it appears that the many of the most massive elliptical galaxies are very old as judged from their stellar content .",
    "thus it seems that the rate of the merger process depends strongly on the local density .",
    "a large survey of lrgs at @xmath9 therefore has two objectives : revealing the large scale structure and clustering of matter when the universe was about two thirds of its present age , and understanding the evolution of the most massive galaxies themselves .",
    "the sdss lrg survey @xcite is limited to @xmath10 by the fixed exposure time of 45 m , set for sdss spectroscopic observations in the lower redshift main galaxy survey .",
    "this is well above the limit to which lrgs can be selected reliably from the sdss imaging data .",
    "the original 2dfgrs included all galaxies with blue magnitude @xmath11 , which reached @xmath12 and required exposures of less than an hour on the aat . by increasing the exposure time to 4h and targetting only the relatively rare lrgs for spectroscopy in the red spectral region , 2df can reach @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the surface density of lrg targets requires only 200 of the 400 2df fibres within each @xmath15 diameter field , so all the lrgs were observed in one of the two 2df spectrographs .",
    "the other was used for a lower resolution survey of faint qsos @xcite which extends the earlier 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz : @xcite ) .",
    "the two new surveys together comprise the 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey , 2slaq .",
    "a bonus of 2slaq is that there is some overlap in redshift range for the lrgs and qsos , which will enable a direct comparison between their spatial distributions .",
    "there is also scope for investigating environmental and gravitational lensing effects , through the comparison of foreground lrgs and the absorption spectra of nearby background qsos ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the 2slaq targets were selected within two narrow equatorial strips , each @xmath15 wide and about @xmath16 long running through the northern and southern galactic caps , chosen for having good photometry at the time of the first sdss data release ( dr1 : @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the lrg survey was to obtain spectra for 10,000 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "this paper describes the photometric target selection , spectroscopic observations and data analysis for the lrgs , and summarises the properties of the sample .",
    "basic cosmological parameters are being derived from the full sample , such as luminosity functions @xcite and spatial correlation functions and clustering @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigate the incidence of star formation as a function of redshift and have identified rare ` k+a ' galaxies which had a substantial burst of star formation within the last billion years , while @xcite identify and determine the cosmic evolution of almost 400 2slaq lrgs which are catalogued radio sources .",
    "the 2slaq lrg redshifts have been used by @xcite and by @xcite and @xcite to validate the determination of sdss photometric redshifts .",
    "distant lrgs were selected on the basis of sdss photometric data ( see @xcite for the definition of the @xmath18 @xmath19 system ) , using a two - colour plot of ( @xmath20 ) against ( @xmath21 ) and the @xmath22band magnitude .",
    "effectively , the selection uses a crude determination of photometric redshift as the 4000  break moves through the @xmath23 bands .",
    "the colour criteria are similar to those used for the cut ii sample of sdss lrgs @xcite , although the selection here is easier since beyond @xmath24 there is less confusion with lower - redshift galaxies .",
    "targets were also required to have non - stellar images .",
    "the selection of targets into several priority classes was done originally using the best sdss photometry available in 2003 .",
    "the later dr4 photometry @xcite has been used in the final redshift lists and for the diagrams in this paper . for most objects the changes amount to at most a few hundredths of a magnitude , with r.m.s .",
    "scatters of @xmath25  mag and negligible mean shifts of only @xmath26  mag in each colour .",
    "the photometry for some galaxies changed by larger amounts , due mainly to changes in how composite images were de - blended : as a result , a few tens of galaxies ( @xmath27% ) now appear to have colours inconsistent with their original selection classification .      after some experimentation two main samples of lrgs were defined .",
    "the primary sample ( sample  8 in the data lists ) has a surface density of about 70  @xmath28 , chosen to maximise the completeness and spatial uniformity of 2df coverage for lrgs with @xmath29 ( see section 3.2 ) . the secondary sample  9 consists of galaxies with @xmath30 , to utilise fibres which could not be assigned to primary targets .",
    "a few targets falling outside the selection boundaries were included as ` fillers ' ( sample  0 ) .",
    "[ 2colsel ] illustrates the colour selection boundaries superimposed on the sdss photometric data .",
    "most galaxies of all types lie along a common locus in the lower left hand corner of this plot , becoming redder in @xmath21 with increasing redshift until the 4000 break moves into the @xmath31band at @xmath32 . thereafter",
    ", the @xmath20 colour becomes rapidly redder until the break moves into the @xmath22band at @xmath33 .",
    "thus the most massive and luminous intermediate redshift galaxies , i.e. lrgs with a dominant passively - evolving population , are expected to lie along a vertical track with @xmath34 in fig .",

    "the primary ( sample  8) lrg targets lie in the top zone in the plot , above the diagonal lines @xmath35 and the upper @xmath36 cut at 0.65 ( see text for details ) .",
    "the secondary ( sample 9 ) objects lie between the two parallel @xmath36 cuts at 0.65 and 0.55 .",
    "most of the points below the @xmath37 cut ( in the bottom right hand quadrilateral ) represent lower redshift lrgs from the initial observing runs . passively evolving lrgs with @xmath38",
    "are expected to lie along an approximately vertical locus in this plot , with @xmath34 and with @xmath20 increasing from @xmath39 to @xmath40 as redshift increases from 0.4 to 0.7 .",
    "nearly all lower redshift galaxies of all types lie below the @xmath41 boundary in the bottom left hand corner .",
    "the points with @xmath42 are mainly due to errors in the sdss @xmath43-band photometry for such faint objects.,width=359 ]    cuts above lines of constant @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) select early - type galaxies at increasingly high redshift .",
    "the top priority primary sample has @xmath45 while the secondary sample has @xmath46 .",
    "a second cut with @xmath47 eliminates later - type galaxies .",
    "the colours used here are the extinction - corrected @xmath48 colours : the definition of these and other sdss parameters can be found in @xcite or at ` http://www.sdss.org/dr4/algorithms/photometry.html ` .",
    "the third main selection parameter is the de - reddened magnitude in the @xmath22band : the 2slaq lrgs have @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total magnitude based on a fit to a de vaucouleurs profile and @xmath51 is the extinction in the @xmath22-band .",
    "this choice of a fixed limiting magnitude enables the selection of bright lrgs out to @xmath52 , although it also means that the sample at @xmath53 includes a substantial number of fainter early - type galaxies with luminosity @xmath54 .",
    "further cuts @xmath55 eliminate objects too far from the main lrg locus , probably mostly composite objects or the result of photometric errors .    the photometric selection criteria are summarised in table  [ selcrit ] .",
    "the first two rows define the primary sample  8 and secondary sample  9 , which comprise 67% and 27% respectively of the final lrg survey .",
    "4% of the objects are in samples  36 , observed in march and april 2003 using somewhat different criteria ( section  2.2 ) .",
    "the final 2% fell outside the selection boundaries and have been assigned to sample  0 .",

    "objects too diffuse to yield useful spectra using the 2  arcsec diameter 2df fibres were eliminated by requiring @xmath70 ( such objects are liable to be spurious in any case ) .",

    ".  [ 2colsel ] , beyond @xmath71 , is mainly due to photometric errors in the sdss @xmath43-band .",
    "most points in this region have @xmath72 and correspond to galaxies with @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 . at this very faint level",
    "the mean error in @xmath43 is more than 0.3  mag .",
    "different cuts and priorities were used for the initial observing runs in march and april 2003 .",
    "the original magnitude limit was @xmath75 but it became apparent that reliable redshifts could be determined to somewhat fainter limits .",
    "tests showed that @xmath76 was a realistic limit in exposure times of 4  hours .",
    "the number counts are sufficiently steep that this relatively small change had two very significant consequences : the proportion of high redshift galaxies with @xmath77 doubled to @xmath78% and half of the primary targets are in the faint extension .",
    "effectively the original limit became the new median redshift , at @xmath79 .",
    "three colour - selected samples were defined originally : a top priority class consisting of all objects with @xmath80 and two sparse - sampled classes with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( samples  3 , 4 and 5 respectively ) .",
    "these targets all had @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "a special faint sample  6 with @xmath85 was observed in one test field , d10 , and was used to determine the optimum magnitude limit for the remainder of the survey .",
    "in addition to the different sample specifications , there were subsequent small revisions to the sdss dr1 photometry .",
    "most of the early observations could be reassigned to samples  8 or 9 and nearly all of the fields have been re - observed to maintain the uniformity of the survey , but about 900 galaxies remain outside the primary and secondary samples .",
    "the aat 2df fibre system @xcite is ideally suited to this project . the lrg surface density is @xmath8670 per sq deg down to a magnitude limit of @xmath13 , corresponding to an sdss fibre magnitude of @xmath87 .",
    "2df can provide reliable redshifts for over 90% of such targets in four hours , in average conditions .",
    "atmospheric refraction limits the maximum time for which a given 2df configuration can be efficiently observed to about 3h for fields on the equator , so most fields were observed on two consecutive nights .",
    "the most practical survey design was two narrow strips along the celestial equator , one in each galactic hemisphere , given the early sdss photometric coverage and the requirement to work through complete nights .",
    "there was also a desire to overlap with previous surveys such as 2qz @xcite and the millenium galaxy survey @xcite and to enable follow - up observations from large telescopes in both hemispheres .",
    "the northern strip runs from 8.2h to 15.3h in ra , broken into five sub - strips to utilise the best photometric data ; the southern strip runs from 20.6h to 4.0h .",
    "each strip can be covered by a single row of overlapping 2df fields .",
    "the ends of the strips come close to galactic latitude @xmath88 and thus suffer from significant extinction of up to 0.4 mag in @xmath43 ( based on the maps of @xcite ) , plus substantial foreground star contamination .",
    "priority was therefore given to fields nearer the centre of each strip with @xmath89 and extinction @xmath90 mag .",
    "[ fields ] shows the layout of the target strips and the 2df fields actually observed .",
    "there is considerable imbalance between the two strips , with the northern strip containing more than two thirds of the data and having much higher completeness .",
    "this was an accidental consequence of the nights scheduled and variable observing conditions .",
    "open circles represent fields with completeness @xmath91% or with non - standard selection criteria .",
    "the letters ` a'-`e ' and ` s ' signify the sub - strips and are used as the first character of the field names.,width=377 ]      the principal objective was to maximise the total number of objects in a photometrically well - defined sample , with good coverage on different spatial scales and minimal incompleteness . for simplicity",
    "it was decided to use a fixed field separation . for the initial observations in march and april 2003",
    "the centres were set @xmath92 apart but this was increased to @xmath93 for all subsequent observations , following modelling tests of the yield .",
    "two strategies helped to maximise the fraction of targets which were observed .",
    "about 28% of the targets lie in the overlap regions of adjacent 2df fields .",
    "targets which had been observed in the configuration for one field were given lower priority in the adjacent fields .",
    "a sequence of alternate fields was observed first , followed by the partially overlapping fields in a second pass along the strip .",
    "this led to independent repeat observations for a few percent of the total sample , giving a valuable check on the internal accuracy of the data .",
    "the second strategy arose because each field was observed on two or more nights .",
    "a significant fraction of the targets , mainly the brighter galaxies and most of the m - stars , had good spectra and unambiguous redshifts after only one night .",
    "typically some 1020% of the fibres could then be re - allocated to new targets .",
    "this helped in crowded fields in particular , since due to physical constraints 2df fibres have a minimum separation of at least 30  arcsec .",
    "tests of the 2df configure software showed that the algorithm which assigns fibres to targets could introduce significant patterns into the distribution of observed objects across the 2df field .",
    "the main effect was a discontinuity in density at @xmath94 radius , if the mean number of targets per field in the input catalogue was much higher than the number of fibres .",
    "there could also be systematic effects depending on the ordering of the input catalogue .",
    "both effects were avoided in the 2slaq surveys by keeping the surface density of the top priority targets below 70  @xmath28 and by randomising the order of the targets in the input catalogue .",
    "there are instrumental constraints on the targets accessible to 2df",
    ". the nominal @xmath15 field can be up to @xmath95 in diameter , but this varied slightly during the survey due to both hardware and software limits .",
    "there are also 20 small triangular regions around the edge of the field which are inaccessible to the fibres feeding one spectrograph .",
    "the net result is that the effective area of the survey can be approximated by a row of overlapping @xmath15-diameter circles .",
    "[ xy ] shows the distribution of targets across the 2df field , for all objects in the final redshift catalogue .",
    "there is a slightly lower density of points towards the right hand edge of the field due to the asymmetrical distribution of sky fibres ( see section  4.2 ) .",
    "both this density gradient and the empty triangles on the eastern and western edges are largely eliminated when the data from overlapping fields are combined , but the northern and southern triangles remain .",
    "field diameter ; the solid circle at @xmath92 radius indicates the effective area covered .",
    "the empty triangles around the edge are inaccessible to the fibres feeding the single spectrograph used for the lrgs .",
    "the lower density towards the right - hand side of the field is due to the allocation of 2030 of the western fibres to sky : those fibres feed the central rows in the spectrograph camera.,width=359 ]      in addition to the inaccessible regions shown in fig .",
    "[ xy ] , each fibre button has a large ` footprint ' with a long tail due to the fibre , which runs across the front of the 2df field plate .",
    "it is never possible to access targets within 30  arcsec of another which has already had a fibre allocated , and in some directions the exclusion zone is much larger .",
    "there is therefore a strong intrinsic bias against observing close pairs of galaxies , and very few fibres can be allocated to members of one cluster .",
    "this bias is partially overcome within the overlap regions of adjacent 2df fields , and a few fields were independently observed in different runs .",
    "the bias is also alleviated by the policy of re - allocating some fibres after the first night on a given field ( section  3.1 ) .",
    "however , there must remain a substantial bias against close pairs of targets and the level of incompleteness will have to be assessed by comparing the objects actually observed with the full input catalogue .",
    "there is a similar conflict between the lrgs and qsos , since the two classes of objects were observed simultaneously .",
    "thus , although one of the strengths of 2slaq is having samples of lrgs and qsos in the same fields and within the same redshift range , there is a bias against qsos which lie near lrgs since the lrgs were given higher priority than the qsos in the allocation process .",
    "the lrgs were observed with 2df spectrograph number  2 , using a 600 lines  mm@xmath96 @xmath97 grating .",
    "the detector was a tek1024 ccd with @xmath98 pixels , giving a dispersion of 2.2  pixel@xmath96 and an effective resolution of about 5  or @xmath99 .",
    "almost all the spectra were taken with the central wavelength set to 6150 , covering the range 5050  to 7250 .",
    "this enables secure determination of redshifts for @xmath100 using the ca  ii h&k lines and the detection of [ o  ii ] 3727  down to @xmath101 . for the first observing run in march 2003 the central wavelength",
    "was set to 6350  but almost no useful data were obtained beyond 7250 , due to telluric features which did not cancel well in the low dispersion 2df spectra .",
    "more details of the spectrographs and their performance are given in @xcite .",
    "a subset of the 2df fibres was assigned to clear sky positions , after checking the sdss images .",
    "these are used to determine a median sky spectrum which is subtracted from all target spectra . for each frame",
    "30 fibres were assigned to sky ( later reduced to 20 , after tests showed that this resulted in negligible degradation ) .",
    "these sky fibres were selected to lie in the central half of the ccd ( i.e. between spectra 50 and 150 ) to keep the sky spectra uniform , although this results in some mismatch to spectra at the edges of the ccd due to optical distortions in the camera . in principle",
    "it is possible to correct for these but this has not yet been implemented in the 2df software .",
    "the fibres which feed the centre of the ccd happen to lie on the western side of the 2df field , which causes the slight density gradient seen in fig .",
    "[ xy ] .",
    "the standard pattern was to take sets of seven exposures per field : a quartz lamp flat - field , an arc lamp exposure using 4 cu ",
    "ar lamps and 2 he  ar lamps , @xmath102s exposures on the targets and a final arc exposure .",
    "thus in good conditions four or occasionally five sets of observations were obtained per night and four 2df fields could be fully observed in two nights . in poor conditions",
    "the observations were extended over extra nights , until the required mean signal - to - noise per pixel ( s / n ) ( and hence redshift completeness fraction ) was reached .",
    "the 2slaq surveys were supported approximately equally by the australian and british time assignment panels , plus a few director s discretionary nights , to give a total allocation of 87 nights between march 2003 and august 2005 . on average about 60% of the time was useable .",
    "a total of 102 datasets was obtained for 80 2df fields , 54 in the northern strip and 26 in the south .",
    "observations were deemed to be complete ( i.e. reliable redshifts for at least 85% of the primary targets ) for 72 fields while 8 are either incomplete or used non - standard selection criteria .",
    "the final yield was very close to one completed field per allocated night , about half of the best possible rate .",
    "this is lower than the overall fraction of clear time because 2df can not be re - configured quickly .",
    "the 80 distinct fields which were observed are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fields ] and all the datasets are listed in appendix  a , along with various quality parameters which are discussed in section  5.5 .",
    "some fields have more than one dataset because data were obtained in separate observing runs , sometimes with different parameters or target selections , and were reduced independently .",
    "there is some scope for combining such datasets before analysis which would lead to better quality spectra for repeated targets , but the gain in redshift completeness will be very small .    given that it was impossible to cover entire strips in the time available , the aim was to observe several continuous sub - strips within each galactic hemisphere .",
    "in the event , the time allocated and the observing conditions led to more than twice as much data being obtained in the northern strip as in the south .",
    "nine separate sub - strips have been observed with varying levels of completeness .",
    "the proportion of primary ( sample 8) input targets for which reliable redshifts were obtained reaches 90% in the best regions such as northern sub - strips ` b ' and ` d ' , each of which is @xmath103 long .",
    "each of these sub - strips covers a volume of space comparable to that observed in the northern 2dfgrs strip , since the angular extent of the latter was about five times larger but the mean redshift was only a fifth as high .",
    "all of the raw data have been analysed using the aao 2dfdr software @xcite . for each field , the location of the fibres on the ccd was determined using a quartz lamp exposure which was also used as a flat field to remove pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "two arc exposures provided wavelength calibration . all spectra were scaled according to the relative throughput of the fibres , as determined from the strongest night sky lines , and a median sky spectrum was subtracted from each object spectrum .",
    "the different frames for each field were combined using mean flux weighting , which takes account of the variable signal levels arising from changes in ` seeing ' , transparency or exposure time ; cosmic ray events were removed during this final step .",
    "the 2dfdr software was developed for the analysis of the 2dfgrs/2qz data .",
    "for those surveys , the data for each field consisted of several similar frames with precisely the same 200 targets , all taken on the same night .",
    "the 2dfdr software was modified during the course of the 2slaq surveys to cope with data taken on different nights , sometimes with significant changes to the central wavelength and often with altered allocations of fibres to targets .",
    "the lrg redshifts were derived using a modified version of the zcode fortran program , developed by @xcite and others for the 2dfgrs spectra of low redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "that program determined two independent redshifts whenever possible , one based on discrete emission lines and the other using cross - correlation with a set of template spectra .",
    "the higher resolution 2slaq lrg spectra cover only half the wavelength range and the targets have been photometrically selected to be predominantly passively evolving early - type galaxies at much higher redshifts ( @xmath104 ) . thus it is rarely possible to derive a secure redshift using emission lines alone : the only line which is common is [ o  ii ] at 3727 , detected by the zcode in about 20% of the spectra . the 2slaq version of the zcode derives redshifts by cross - correlating each spectrum against a set of templates and uses any emission lines only as a check on the cross - correlation results .    the cross - correlations are done using the method of @xcite , which involves fourier transformation of all the spectra and templates .",
    "the program selects the most plausible redshift for each object and assigns a quality parameter ` q ' , which is a measure of the consistency and reliability of the initial set of redshift estimates .",
    "another indicator of the reliability of the redshift is given by the @xcite parameter ` @xmath31 ' ( called @xmath105 here to avoid confusion with the photometric @xmath31 ) , which measures the height of the cross - correlation peak relative to the general noise level .",
    "the spectrum , cross - correlation function and redshift for each target are shown on an interactive graphic display .",
    "the operator can either accept the automatic redshift or choose a different value ( e.g. by making alternative identifications of strong features or by selecting a different template ) .",
    "the operator assigns an independent quality parameter to the reliability of each redshift .",
    "the lrg version of the zcode can be run in several modes : the basic fully interactive mode in which every spectrum is visually checked ; a quick mode in which only spectra with low quality redshifts are inspected ; and a fully automatic mode .",
    "the advantage of inspecting every spectrum is that unusual or extreme objects can be identified , including composite spectra ; the automatic mode has the advantages of being more consistent and objective .",
    "the semi - automatic ` quick ' mode provides a good compromise between the two methods and is normally used for initial data reductions at the telescope .",
    "given the rather homogeneous 2slaq spectra , it has proved possible to tune the automatic zcode to give very reliable results for most objects .",
    "fewer than 1% of the galaxies give significantly discrepant redshifts from two independent analyses of the same dataset or from repeat observations of the same targets ( section  6.1 ) . a majority ( 72% ) of the redshifts for the initial data release have been derived automatically , without visual inspection .",
    "some datasets from each observing run have been re - analysed in fully interactive mode to verify that the error rate remains low .",
    "all redshifts have been corrected to be heliocentric .",
    "information on the templates and other details specific to the redshifting of the 2slaq lrgs are given in appendix  b.      the principal indicator of lrg redshift reliability is the parameter @xmath106 . note that @xmath106 does not necessarily indicate the quality of the actual spectrum .",
    "although the two are strongly correlated in general , there are cases where a very poor spectrum yields an unambiguous redshift , and conversely .",
    "two quality values are output by the zcode : the automatic value ( @xmath107 ) set by the code itself , and the operator value ( @xmath108 ) set during the visual inspection of the data .",
    "the preferred value is generally the operator value , where both exist .",
    "the definitions of the operator values are as follows :    @xmath109 : a good spectrum with an unambiguous redshift ( usually @xmath110 ) , based on several strong features .",
    "@xmath111 : a single strong cross - correlation peak ( with @xmath112 ) and some obvious features ( most often h&k , g - band and/or balmer lines ) .",
    "@xmath113 : a plausible redshift but not completely convincing ( @xmath114 ) , or where alternative redshifts are possible .",
    "@xmath115 : a spectrum where no believable redshift can be found .    in each case",
    ", the presence of [ o  ii ] 3727 emission ( or , rarely , [ o  iii ] at 5007 ) at the absorption redshift can be used to increase the @xmath106 value by 1 unit ( but with @xmath109 remaining the maximum for @xmath108 ) .",

    "the overall quality of each dataset ( i.e. each set of combined frames for a given 2df field ) can be evaluated in several ways , using four global parameters listed in table  [ fldlist ] in appendix  a. these parameters are the number of raw data frames , @xmath122 ; the mean s / n per pixel ; the mean difference between the logarithm of the counts obtained and the expected magnitudes of the targets , @xmath123 , using here the sdss @xmath124 parameter ; and the percentage of targets with reliable redshifts .",
    "the redshift success rate , defined as the fraction of targets which have redshift reliability @xmath106 of 3 or more , is the most important one for the lrg survey , while the mean s / n should be the most reliable measure of overall quality . the observing strategy attempts to minimise the variations in mean s / n by taking more frames in poor conditions , but this is only partially successful since non - statistical errors begin to become significant when many frames are combined .",

    "most of the datasets with low completeness were re - observed to give higher final redshift completeness .",
    "data from fields with less than 85% final completeness are retained in the lrg catalogue but must be treated with caution in any statistical studies .",
    "nearly all the datasets with s / n@xmath129 are for northern fields observed early in 2003 , when a brighter magnitude cut - off was used .",
    "the 2slaq lrg survey is spatially incomplete ( see fig .  [ fields ] ) and has a variable redshift success rate ( table  [ fldlist ] ) .",

    "[ completeness8 ] shows the number of potential targets in each field of the northern strip for samples  8 and 9 , with considerable cosmic variance between fields .",
    "the middle panel shows the percentage of primary targets with reliable redshifts , which is close to 90% on average and reasonably uniform .",
    "this is the overall completeness , i.e. the fraction of targets observed multiplied by the redshift success rate .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ completeness8 ] gives the equivalent plot for the secondary sample  9 objects , for which the completeness is much lower and much less uniform , ranging from 20% up to 90% .",
    "sample  9 utilised only those 2df fibres which could not be placed on primary targets : it tends to be least complete in the highest density fields .",
    "the completeness is particularly poor for the low galactic latitude fields a01 and a02 , which were observed only with the original 2003 selection criteria .",
    "similarly , the southern field s01 was abandoned after its high levels of stellar contamination and foreground reddening were recognised .",
    "it is difficult to define the precise boundaries of the 2slaq survey , given the overlapping tiling pattern , the inaccessible triangles near the edge of the field ( fig .",
    "[ xy ] ) and the fibre re - allocation observing strategy .",
    "one simple way to derive a very complete sample is to work in rectangles which lie completely within the patterns of overlapping 2df circles .",
    "two such inscribed rectangles can be drawn in the well - observed northern sub - strips ` b ' and ` d ' , containing over 30% of the entire lrg survey .",
    "the targetting completeness is 94.5% for the primary sample  8 and the redshift completeness is 96.7% , giving an overall completeness of 91.4% .",
    "the best way to evaluate the completeness of the 2slaq survey , and to calculate its effective total area , is to create a spatial mask including all objects in the input lists which could in principle have been accessed by 2df from at least one of the observed field centres .",
    "this has been done by @xcite and the resulting mask will be made available as part of the survey data .",
    "two ` ascii ` listings are generated by the zcode for each 2df field .",
    "one , ` filenamez.rz ` , gives the target names , positions , fibre numbers , redshift parameters and some photometric and quality data , with one line for each spectrum analysed .",

    "some overall statistics , such as the numbers of reliable redshifts and the mean s / n of all the spectra , are also recorded .",
    "the ` * z.rz ` files are concatenated and sorted to generate the final output redshift lists for the lrg survey .",
    "the target names follow the standard iau convention , i.e. using the truncated j2000 position in right ascension and declination .",
    "these are quoted to a precision of 0.1  arcsec , which ensures unambiguous identification of the objects .",
    "however , one drawback is that sometimes the names can change slightly when the input sdss photometric data are revised , or when positions are converted between arcsec ( and seconds of time ) and decimal degrees or radians .",
    "the only safe way to make cross - identifications with other catalogues is to look for positional coincidences , rather than identical names .",
    "multiple observations were made for about 20% of the targets , either because they lay in the overlap regions of adjacent 2df fields or because entire fields were re - observed .",
    "the 2dfdr and zcode software originally assumed that all observations for a given dataset were taken using the same configuration of 200 fibres with the same spectrograph set - up .",
    "thus two or more independent spectra were obtained for many objects and two catalogues have been generated , one listing every spectrum obtained and the other with a single entry for each discrete object observed .",
    "the latter , which is the basic redshift catalogue , simply uses the best available redshift for each object .",
    "the selection is based on the redshift quality parameter @xmath106 , or on mean s / n when two spectra give the same @xmath106 .",
    "better spectra could be obtained for some repeated objects by combining the independent spectra from different observing runs .",
    "every spectrum should also be checked visually , to pick up any very peculiar objects or ones where the automatic redshifting has missed some obvious feature such as a composite spectrum .",
    "however , this will make very little difference to the actual redshifts : there should simply be a small increase in the number which are reliable .",
    "the radio sources which comprise about 3.5% of the 2slaq lrgs @xcite have been used as a quality control sample and confirm this expectation .",
    "the redshift lists are held in the 2slaq team archive at the university of queensland , ` http://lrg.physics.uq.edu.au/ ` and can be accessed via links at the university of portsmouth ( ` http://www.2slaq.info ` ) , at the aao ( ` http://www.aao.gov.au ` ) and elsewhere .",

    "the bins are independent , supporting the reality of the dip in the full distribution at @xmath178 .",
    "the highly skewed distribution of emission line galaxies indicates the existence of two separate populations of high redshift galaxies , with only the redder peak corresponding to true lrgs.,width=317 ]    the template statistics given in appendix  b support the identification of two types of galaxy among the highest redshift 2slaq lrgs .",
    "the main ( redder ) concentration of galaxies nearly all fit the composite lrg spectrum ( t1 ) best and must be true lrgs , while many of the bluer galaxies lying close to the @xmath41 boundary are best fit by the later - type emission - line galaxy ngc  5248 ( t3 ) ( see fig .  [ tzhist ] ) .",
    "the appearance of emission - line or star forming galaxies along the @xmath41 boundary is evident in the lower redshift bins as well , at least down to @xmath161 , which probably indicates that the two basic populations occur throughout the present sample as in other galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "this population is a contaminant in the lrg sample , and has to be distinguished from the subset of true lrgs which have emission lines due to either transient star formation or agn activity , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the two - colour distribution of the primary targets which were observed but failed to yield a reliable redshift is shown in fig .",
    "this distribution is not the same as for the full input sample ( fig .",
    "[ 2colsel ] ) or any of the redshift subsamples in fig .",
    "[ 2col8multi ] . evidently the redshift failure rate is a complex function of redshift itself , and of other parameters such as magnitude and colour .",
    "[ noz ] suggests that a considerable fraction of the ` failed ' objects are high redshift galaxies with @xmath179 , while there is also a significant population near the @xmath180 cut - off with colours similar to @xmath181 galaxies .",
    "there are few failed redshift targets within the main clump of @xmath38 lrgs seen in the central panels of fig .",

    "quantitatively , the fraction of failed redshift objects with colours within the main concentration of lrgs ( taken here as the objects with @xmath182 ) is only 5% compared with 8% for all objects in sample  8 . by contrast , 12% of the reddest objects with @xmath183 fail to yield reliable redshifts and this fraction rises to 17% for the bluest objects with @xmath184 .",
    "these variations demonstrate that there are real correlated differences in colour and spectral type within the primary sample : they can not simply be due to either poor spectra or photometric errors .",
    "many of the reddest and bluest objects must have spectra which are not so well matched to any of the template spectra as are the bulk of the lrgs . some may be active galaxies of various types",
    ", some may be composite spectra due to chance alignments . the ` failed redshift ' list may also include some very high redshift objects with @xmath185 , given that such objects are difficult to recognise in the 2slaq data .",
    "a few spectra with high s / n also fail to yield redshifts ; in at least one case this was due to contamination of the spectrum by light from a nearby bright star with an almost featureless spectrum in the 2slaq wavelength range .",
    "the discussions of the colour distributions above , of sample completeness in section  5.5 and of redshift reliability in section  6 , together indicate that the 2slaq sample of true passively evolving lrgs is over 95% spectroscopically complete and reliable for redshifts between 0.5 and 0.65 .",
    "few lrgs can have been missed , and few non - lrgs included , down to the @xmath186 magnitude limit .",
    "the primary sample  8 is also almost spatially complete in the most fully observed regions , assuming that the sdss input catalogue is itself almost complete , so that it should be possible to define a sample of lrgs with an absolute completeness of better than 90% .",
    "the primary sample  8 2slaq lrgs therefore provide a good sample of co - moving test particles for cosmological purposes and for constraining lrg evolution .",
    "in particular , most of the lrgs seen at redshift 0.65 must be the progenitors of lrgs at @xmath187 , and of the passively evolving lrgs seen at lower redshift in other surveys .    the secondary sample  9 2slaq lrgs are much less useful for studying large scale structure , since their spatial completeness is very variable from field to field . however , this sample has a much tighter colour distribution than sample  8 ( fig .",
    "[ 2colsel ] ) and so comprises a more homogeneous set of galaxies , with high redshift completeness and little contamination , which will be very useful for studying the evolution of lrgs .      a map of the spatial distribution of the lrgs within the more complete northern slice is shown in fig .",

    "the primary sample has high spectroscopic completeness in the sense that good redshifts have been obtained for @xmath138% of the targets within the best - observed fields .",
    "the survey also has high absolute completeness for lrgs with @xmath196 and de - reddened total @xmath22-band magnitude brighter than 19.6 , since such galaxies lie well clear of the photometric selection boundaries .",
    "the sdss-2df lrg survey thus offers a significant advance in our understanding of the most massive galaxies over the past 8  gyr : the census of such objects must be almost complete",

    "most fields were observed on two or more nights during an observing run and all the data combined , in which case the final two characters are either ` 00 ' or ` fi ' . occasionally data were obtained on only one night , in which case the last two digits give the date .",
    "a few specially combined datasets are identified by other character combinations . where the same field was observed in different",
    "runs the datasets are listed separately since the target lists will be different , although often with many objects in common .",
    "column  9 gives the number of exposures combined in each dataset , @xmath122 , normally each of 30  min duration .",
    "column  10 gives the mean s / n achieved , averaged over all pixels for all targets , and @xmath123 in column  11 is the mean offset in magnitudes in a plot of log(counts ) versus @xmath31-band fibre magnitude for each dataset ( total @xmath50 magnitude was used instead of @xmath197 for some early datasets : these account for most of the negative values of dmag ) .",

    "the footnotes give further details on some datasets .",
    "the third column of table  [ templist ] lists small zero - point velocity offsets which have been derived in two ways : from the mean differences for a set of lrgs , all cross - correlated with each template , and by cross - correlating each template with a synthetic k - type stellar spectrum generated using the _ ssg _ code of @xcite .",

    "the ngc  3379 ( t2 ) spectrum , which is very similar but without the uv tail , was used for a further 16% : for most objects these two templates give virtually identical results .",
