    "antiferromagnetic spin correlations are present in many strongly correlated electron systems , notably the prototype mott insulators nio and @xmath0 , the parent compounds of htsc cuprates , and heavy fermion systems such as ybp , @xmath1 , and many others .",
    "many of those systems are intrinsically disordered , in particular upon additional homo- or heterovalent doping .",
    "the influence of impurity doping on antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and electronic properties has recently been studied in a variety of systems .",
    "doping with static scatterers like nonmagnetic impurities usually weakens antiferromagnetic order , a prominent example being zn doping in @xmath2 @xcite . in spin chains ( @xmath3 )",

    "_ _    in the present paper we will study the influence of disorder on af order and the mott band gap in correlated antiferromagnets .",
    "we employ the hubbard model in the presence of different types of disorder . while the ( disordered ) hubbard model is certainly far too simple to describe real materials it already contains very rich physics including local moment formation , magnetic ordering , mott - hubbard transition , and anderson localization .",
    "on the other hand , the interplay of disorder and interactions in electronic systems belongs to the most difficult problems in physics , and reliable results within simple models are still very desirable .",
    "the problem has been investigated in the past by a variety of methods , including field theoretical approaches @xcite , renormalization group treatments @xcite , unrestricted hartree - fock @xcite , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , and several more ( see @xcite for a review ) . here",
    "we give an overview of results obtained by qmc and dmft concentrating on the af phase diagram and the mott gap .",
    "we consider the following hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath9 in principle all parameters @xmath10 can be randomly distributed .",
    "the precise definition of the different disorder types studied in this paper will be given in the following sections .",
    "the average @xmath11 sets our energy scale",
    ". we will restrict the hopping @xmath12 to nearest - neighbors hence not allowing for frustration .",
    "longer range , random hopping amplitudes will be important in the modeling of amorphous materials such as doped semiconductors @xcite and are not considered in the present work .",
    "we use a finite temperature determinant quantum monte carlo method @xcite to obtain approximation - free results for finite lattices .",
    "the algorithm is based on a mapping of the interacting electron problem onto a @xmath13 dimensional quasi - classical problem using auxiliary ising - type spins .",
    "it provides for calculating thermal averages of observables , @xmath14 , at a temperature @xmath15 , @xmath16 the phase space sampling over the auxiliary field configurations is performed using monte carlo techniques .",
    "the weight of a configuration is proportional to a product of two determinants , one for each electron spin species . in the case of half - filling without random potentials ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath17 , on a bipartite lattice the determinants always have the same sign , hence their product is always positive semi - definite , which can be shown by particle - hole transformation of one spin species @xmath18 $ ] . in the general situation that the product can become negative the algorithm can still be employed in principle . however , the signal to noise ratio decreases exponentially with systems size , inverse temperature , and interaction , putting severe restrictions to the applicability of the method .",
    "this so - called `` minus - sign problem '' is a general obstacle for all exact fermionic monte carlo methods as well as for spin - systems in the presence of frustration . even without the minus - sign problem",
    "the computational effort is large because the computer time grows cubically with system size @xmath19 , restricting @xmath19 to the order of 100 on present supercomputers .    in the case of disorder",
    "all observables have to be averaged over the ( frozen ) disorder configurations .",
    "because of the computational effort we restrict ourselves to two dimensional lattices with linear size up to @xmath20 which often allows a reliable finite size scaling .",
    "since we are interested in af ordering we calculate the magnetic correlation functions @xmath21 and their fourier transforms , the magnetic structure factors @xmath22 , @xmath23    in particular the af structure factor @xmath24 is used to obtain the ground state sublattice magnetization @xmath25 by a finite size scaling ansatz according to spinwave theory @xcite : @xmath26      the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite is a local approximation in which the self energy becomes site diagonal , or momentum independent : @xmath27    the one - particle green function @xmath28 can hence be obtained from the non - interaction green function @xmath29 by @xmath30 , and the local green function is given by @xmath31 this does not imply a simple shift of energies , like in traditional mean - field theories ( e.g.  hartree - fock ) , because @xmath32 remains dynamical , i.e.  frequency dependent , preserving local quantum fluctuations .",
    "the local approximation becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensionality and maps the interacting lattice model onto a self - consistent single impurity model like , for example , the wolff model @xcite : @xmath33    here the one - particle energies @xmath34 have to be defined such that the non - interacting local green function of the wolff model fulfills @xmath35 . in the self - consistent solution the local ( interacting ) green function of the wolff model has to be equal to @xmath36 . in the presence of disorder one",
    "has to average over all possible values of @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "this type of local averaging is equivalent to the `` coherent potential approximation '' , well known from investigations of disordered alloys .",
    "while the self - consistency is rather easily reached by iteration the solution of the single impurity problem is the hard part",
    ". there exists no analytic solution and different numerical and approximative techniques have been employed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we again use auxiliary field qmc @xcite , an algorithm quite similar to the one for finite dimensional lattices sketched above .",
    "the computer time grows like @xmath39 where the number of matsubara frequencies , @xmath40 .",
    "fortunately , qmc for the single band model is free from the minus - sign problem .    in the following the non - interacting dos",
    "is chosen as a semi - elliptic model dos with bandwidth=8 , equal to the @xmath41 tight binding bandwidth for @xmath42 .",
    "a typical quantity under consideration is the staggered magnetic susceptibility @xmath43 whose divergence signals the transition to an af ordered state .",
    "one can also extend the dmft equations to the ordered phase to obtain spin and sublattice dependent electron densities and the sublattice magnetization @xmath25 .",
    "the one - particle density of states ( dos ) is obtained by analytical continuation of the imaginary time green function using the maximum entropy method . for details of the algorithm ,",
    "the implementation of disorder averages and determination of expectation values see @xcite .",
    "random potentials are the most frequently studied type of disorder in the context of anderson localization .",
    "contrary to the hubbard interaction which at half - filling favors single occupation on each site , different local potentials lead to different occupations and hence to a quenching of local magnetic moments on sites with large absolute value of the local potential .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "1a where the average local moment squared , @xmath44 , is plotted versus disorder strength for a flat distribution of @xmath38 values with width @xmath45 .",
    "it is also shown that the spin - spin - correlations go in parallel with @xmath44 . for a large width of random potentials",
    "this type of disorder is apparently very effective in the destruction of magnetic order . to study the behavior of the charge gap , the electronic compressibility , @xmath46 ,",
    "is calculated as a function of @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "while disorder decreases @xmath47 in the non - interacting case , @xmath47 is enhanced by disorder at finite @xmath37 .",
    "the reason is the introduction of states within the af charge gap as will be discussed below .",
    "as mentioned above , random potentials break the particle - hole symmetry leading to a minus - sign problem even at half filling .",
    "this is the reason why only small lattices ( @xmath48 in fig .  1 ) can be studied for this type of disorder .",
    "consider the situation deep in the af phase , i.e.  with a large staggered moment .",
    "a high value of the local potential on a given site reduces the potential barrier for a majority spin electron to tunnel to a neighboring sites . the electron is hence delocalized and the local magnetic moment is reduced .",
    "a low potential on the other hand can not significantly further localize the majority spin because it is already almost saturated .",
    "this asymmetry of the localizing and delocalizing effects of random potentials is depicted in the dmft results , fig .  2 .",
    "the majority spin @xmath49 is strongly reduced for @xmath50 but almost unchanged for @xmath51 .",
    "note that the total local density monotonically decreases with @xmath38 , and that the net magnetization @xmath52 is reduced for any @xmath53 .",
    "the fact that the delocalization is not compensated can be expressed in terms of an enhanced effective hopping parameter @xmath54 . in the case @xmath55 the effective @xmath54 can be estimated by the mapping onto the af heisenberg model : the af exchange arises from virtual hopping of an electron with spin @xmath56 to a neighboring site occupied with an electron of spin @xmath57 . the exchange energy for this and the opposite process is @xmath58 .\\",
    "] ] @xmath59 is hence always _ enhanced _ from the pure case @xmath60 , and the average exchange becomes @xmath61 $ ] where @xmath62 depends only on the shape of the disorder distribution ( e.g. , @xmath63 for the constant , @xmath64 for a binary distribution ) .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the form of the magnon propagator remains unchanged in second order in @xmath65 @xcite , but magnons are stiffened by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "the effective hopping in strong coupling can thus be expressed as @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] . in dimensions",
    "@xmath68 one expects the nel temperature @xmath69 to be proportional to @xmath70 and hence @xmath69 , too , should be enhanced by weak disorder . _",
    "_    while disorder - enhanced delocalization stabilizes af order at strong coupling it suppresses it at weak coupling . for small @xmath37 the af state",
    "is rather `` spin density wave like '' and an enhanced kinetic energy tends to weaken af order and to reduce @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , random potentials destroy the perfect nesting instability responsible for af order at small @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath71 vs.  @xmath37 phase diagram within dmft ( fig .",
    "3 ) summarizes and confirms the above considerations : for small @xmath37 , @xmath69 is reduced and eventually vanishes when @xmath45 becomes roughly equal to @xmath37 . at large @xmath37 , however , the @xmath69 curves for different @xmath45 cross each other , i.e.  at a given value of @xmath37 , @xmath69 increases with disorder .",
    "the opposite effects of disorder on @xmath69 depending on @xmath37 are due to the non - monotonic behavior of the function @xmath72 .",
    "if the slope of @xmath72 is positive ( negative ) an effectively reduced ratio @xmath73 leads to a suppression ( enhancement ) of @xmath69 .",
    "local potentials can induce electronic states in the charge gap .",
    "as also found experimentally the positions of the impurity states are crucial for the stability of af order with respect to carrier doping .",
    "disorder - induced gap states will reduce the size of the charge gap .",
    "we now want to determine the critical disorder strength at which the gap vanishes .",
    "first we treat the disorder within the t - matrix approximation which becomes exact for a single impurity @xcite .",
    "since the local host green function of the correlated , not - disordered problem is unknown we approximate it by the green function of the af hartree - fock solution : @xmath74_{ii}=(1/n)\\sum_{\\bf k } ( \\omega- \\sigma d)/ ( \\omega^2 - e_{\\bf k } ^2 ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is the hubbard energy gap in the pure af , @xmath76 is the af band energy , and @xmath77 is obtained from the self - consistency condition @xmath78 . with this local host",
    "green function we can calculate the location of impurity - induced states from the poles in the t - matrix , @xmath79_{ii})$ ] . we consider a constant distribution of random potentials between @xmath80",
    ". there are disorder - induced states within the gap if @xmath81_{ii}|>2/\\delta$ ] .",
    "the energy @xmath82 up to which states are formed within the gap is given by @xmath83_{ii}= 2/\\delta$ ] .",
    "the remaining charge gap @xmath84 is plotted versus @xmath45 in fig .",
    "the decrease is almost linear and @xmath84 vanishes close to @xmath85 . also shown is the result from a numerical unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) analysis . in this approach , the hf hamiltonian on a finite lattice is numerically ( self - consistently ) diagonalized , so that disorder is treated exactly @xcite . the energy gap is obtained from the energy difference between the lowest energy state of the upper hubbard band and the highest energy state of the lower hubbard band .",
    "averages are taking over 100 disorder realizations on a @xmath86 lattice .",
    "the saturation of the gap at @xmath87 is due to the finite system size .",
    "the agreement with the t - matrix approach is excellent for the present interaction value @xmath88 .",
    "deviations from the t - matrix approach are more pronounced at lower interaction strengths where the fermion states are more extended .",
    "the closing of the charge gap is also observed within the dmft approach",
    "5a shows the density of states for several disorder values .",
    "note that all spectra shown are within the af ordered phase , i.e.  af order is much more stable than the charge gap which closes about @xmath85 .",
    "a linear reduction of the charge gap is also observed in the case of a binary disorder distribution ( fig .",
    "for this stronger type of disorder both the charge gap and the af order vanish near @xmath85 .      as discussed in the previous section the one - particle excitation gap decreases with @xmath45 and vanishes near @xmath85 .",
    "upon further increase of @xmath45 the two hubbard bands will overlap whereby electrons from the highest levels of the lower band ( with @xmath89 ) will be transfered to the lowest levels of the upper band ( with @xmath90 ) .",
    "those sites will become doubly occupied , their local moment will vanish as observed in sec .",
    "[ sec : localmoments ] . in the limit",
    "@xmath91 the hubbard bands at @xmath92 are nearly flat with width @xmath45 .",
    "the overlap region is @xmath93 and the fraction of nonmagnetic sites can be estimated by @xmath94 .    in the following this situation",
    "is modeled by spin vacancies of concentration @xmath95 which will lead to strong magnon scattering .",
    "such diluted antiferromagnets have been widely studied recently mostly within spin diluted heisenberg models @xcite and also hubbard models @xcite . a perturbative analysis in the strong coupling limit @xmath96 @xcite yields a softening of magnons by a factor of @xmath97 in @xmath41 .",
    "extrapolating to large fractions @xmath95 , the magnon energy scale @xmath98 hence vanishes only close to the percolation threshold @xmath99 . in @xmath68",
    "the nel temperature is assumed to be proportional to @xmath100 and a linear decrease of @xmath69 is thus expected . in experiments , e.g.  on li doped nio @xcite such a linear dependence on @xmath95 is indeed observed with a prefactor of 2.2 .    in the limit @xmath101 the percolation threshold is 1.0 ; hence we can expect af order to persist for arbitrarily large dilution . within dmft , too , a linear decrease of @xmath102 is observed for the diluted model at large @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "6a ) . at small",
    "@xmath37 , however , af order is remarkably robust , @xmath69 being constant up to dilutions close to @xmath103 where @xmath69 eventually drops to zero .",
    "this behavior of @xmath69 can be explained by a strong enhancement of the local moment density on the remaining sites at small @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "the reason for this enhancement is that with reduced average number of nearest neighbors the kinetic energy decreases , leading to a stronger localization . at large @xmath37",
    "the local moments are already almost saturated at @xmath104 and just can not be further enhanced .",
    "the situation in the case of vacancies is therefore quite different from the effect of weak site disorder where disorder - enhanced _ delocalization _ is observed . _ _",
    "the case of spin vacancies discussed in the previous section can of course be regarded as a specific type of randomness in the hopping elements . the more generic case of a continuous ( flat ) distribution of",
    "@xmath105 $ ] was studied in @xmath41 using qmc . since the hopping is still restricted between nearest neighbors on a square lattice particle - hole symmetry is preserved and no minus - sign problem occurs at @xmath106 .",
    "random @xmath12 hardly affect the density of local moments ( fig .",
    "7a ) , the slight decrease may be due to the enhanced kinetic energy which is @xmath107 .",
    "nevertheless , longer - range spin - spin correlations are strongly suppressed if @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "7a ) . the finite size scaling according to ( [ eq : fss ] ) yields the af order parameter ( staggered moment ) @xmath25 versus @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "@xmath25 vanishes at a critical disorder strength of @xmath109 .",
    "we propose @xcite that the phase boundary is determined basically by the variance of the af exchange coupling @xmath110 .",
    "af order persists for @xmath111 .",
    "this criterion is consistent with the phase boundary of the bond - disordered af heisenberg model with a bimodal distribution of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the vanishing of af order for this type of disorder is supposedly the formation of local singlets .",
    "such singlets will form first on the strongest bonds and will leave some spins which are weakly coupled to their neighbors unpaired .",
    "those `` free '' spins are expected to give a curie - like contribution to the susceptibility as observed in doped semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the numerical results indeed show a strong enhancement of the uniform susceptibility in the disordered case @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model at @xmath106 exhibits both af order and the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "it is important to note that both effects are in principle independent .",
    "the mott - hubbard mit occurs at intermediate interaction @xmath112 while af order can set in at arbitrarily small @xmath37 due to the fermi surface nesting instability .",
    "it is argued that the mit at @xmath113 represents a quantum critical point which is however concealed by the low temperature af phase @xcite , and attempts are made to suppress the af phase to very low or zero @xmath71 by different types of frustration @xcite . a different possibility to separate af order and the mit is to shift the filling at which the mott - hubbard mit occurs away from @xmath106 by introducing impurities with a low ( or zero ) local interaction with a concentration @xmath114 .",
    "such impurity sites can be doubly occupied without the cost of the local repulsion and hence the mit is expected at a density @xmath115 .",
    "the hubbard model with a bimodal distribution of @xmath37 values ( @xmath116 on a fraction @xmath114 of the lattice , and @xmath117 on the remaining sites ) was investigated by qmc on square lattices and in dmft .",
    "note that for technical reasons ( minus - sign problem ) the choice of the @xmath118disorder in model ( [ eq : dishub ] ) preserves particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this corresponds to different chemical potentials on the two constituents such that at @xmath106 the electronic density is homogeneous , i.e.  independent of @xmath119 . to detect charge gaps",
    "the electron density @xmath120 is plotted versus the chemical potential @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "8a ) . as expected the gap moves to a density off half filling close to @xmath122 .",
    "this agrees with the kinetic energy which shows minima at the corresponding densities ( fig .",
    "at a closer look one observes an additional gap at @xmath106 which is due to the doubling of the unit cell in the af ordered state .",
    "the gaps at @xmath106 and @xmath115 can also be detected by the one - particle spectrum , obtained in dmft ( see @xcite ) . between densities 1 and @xmath122 the systems",
    "is apparently compressible .",
    "figure 9a shows the staggered moment @xmath25 extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit in @xmath41 at @xmath106 as a function of impurity concentration @xmath114 . for small @xmath114",
    "af order is robust leading to the charge gap at @xmath106 .",
    "af order vanishes at @xmath123 , i.e.  close to the percolation threshold @xmath124 .    off",
    "half - filling the finite size scaling is no longer possible due to the minus - sign problem and the af phase boundary is obtained within dmft only ( shown in fig .",
    "9b at @xmath125 ) .",
    "it is found that the @xmath116 impurities can induce af order at densities for which the clean model is disordered . in the clean model @xmath126",
    "additional electrons are free to move and hence very effective in destroying long range order .",
    "@xmath116 sites provide localizing centers which are energetically favorable for the additional carriers .",
    "this is why the af phase extends to larger dopings at finite ( but small ) values of @xmath114 . since the mechanism of localizing mobile dopants",
    "is observed in @xmath41 , too , we expect the enlargement of the af phase to be present in @xmath41 at @xmath113 as well , in spite of the fact that in the clean model in @xmath41 the critical doping is supposed to be zero . eventually at larger fractions @xmath114 the af phase shrinks , and",
    "the critical density approaches 1.0 for @xmath127 ( @xmath128 in the ground state @xcite ) . for even larger values of @xmath114",
    "there is no af order even at @xmath106 .",
    "both the stabilization of af order and the shift of the mott gap to higher densities result from the localization of carriers at the @xmath116 impurities .",
    "af order is only destroyed when the density on the @xmath116 sites saturates , i.e.  it is stable _ across _ the mott - hubbard mit .",
    "hence the separation of mott - hubbard mit and af order is not present in the @xmath116 impurity model , at least not for the present parameter values . _ _",
    "in this paper we discussed different types of disorder in correlated antiferromagnets and presented results obtained mostly by quantum monte carlo simulations in @xmath41 and within dynamical mean - field theory ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "different mechanisms were identified by which disorder can enhance antiferromagnetic order : i ) disorder - enhanced delocalization at strong coupling in the case of weak disorder in the chemical potentials and ii ) localization of surplus carriers in the case of impurities with weak local interaction . in both cases compressible antiferromagnetic phases are observed .",
    "to determine if the gapless af phase is metallic requires the calculation of transport properties which is presently in progress .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations of electronic tight binding models are just making the transition from addressing rather abstract issues of correlation effects to making contact with real experiments .",
    "one important feature in this respect is the treatment of intrinsic disorder . for a quantitative description of experiments , however , the inclusion of a realistic bandstructure is mandatory . here",
    "the dmft will be particularly helpful because it allows for the treatment of multiband models in a wider range of parameters and in the thermodynamic limit .",
