    "dy centauri is known as a hot r coronae borealis ( rcb ) star .",
    "rcb stars are a rare class of peculiar variable stars with two principal defining characteristics : ( i ) they exhibit a propensity to fade at unpredictable times by up to about eight magnitudes as a result of obscuration by clouds of soot , and ( ii ) they have a supergiant - like atmosphere that is very h - deficient , he - rich and c - rich .",
    "the subject of this paper , the remarkable star dy cen , one of the hottest rcbs , is even a peculiar rcb member on several accounts .",
    "it is one of the most hydrogen - rich rcbs .",
    "its circumstellar environment may be home to the fullerene c@xmath1 or more likely proto - fullerenes ( garca - hernndez et al . 2011a ; 2012 ) . in terms of its chemical composition",
    ", dy cen may have a composition that sets it apart from most rcb and extreme helium ( ehe ) stars  see jeffery & heber s ( 1993 ) abundance analysis : dy cen is not only uncharacteristically h - rich but is very fe - poor with a very high s / fe ratio , thus has been classified as a minority rcb star ( lambert & rao 1994 ) ; i.e. , a rcb with extraordinarily high si / fe and s / fe ratios .",
    "however , jeffery et al . ( 2011 ) suggest that the fe abundance was greatly underestimated in 1993 . finally , dy cen is a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( rao et al .",
    "2012 ) , the only known binary among rcbs .",
    "the origins of the hydrogen - deficient rcb and ehe stars are not presently fully understood .",
    "two proposals are commonly advocated . in one , a final helium shell flash or a very late thermal pulse occurs on a cooling white dwarf star ( iben et al . 1983 ; renzini 1990 ; herwig 2000 ) which swells the envelope of the star to supergiant dimensions for a few thousand years and the remaining hydrogen is convected in and consumed while helium and carbon are convected out to the surface .",
    "living examples are believed to be sakurai s object ( v4334 sgr ) and fg sge ( asplund et al .",
    "1997 ; jeffery & schnberner 2006 ) .",
    "the other proposal involves the merger of two white dwarfs : a carbon - oxygen white dwarf accretes a helium white dwarf as a close binary orbit shrinks under the influence of energy loss by gravitational radiation ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1986 ) .",
    "the merger leads to a swollen envelope around the c - o white dwarf which lasts a few thousand years .",
    "evidence from the chemical compositions of rcb and ehe stars suggests that most are products of a merger ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; pandey & lambert 2011 ; jeffery et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "dy cen with an orbital period of about 39 days is experiencing mass loss and presumably mass transfer to a low mass companion . years .",
    "] moreover , it is likely to have experienced mass loss and transfer previously in arriving at its h - poor condition .",
    "rao et al . ( 2012 ) suggest dy cen may evolve to a he - rich sdb star .",
    "many such sdb stars are binaries . in this sense , dy cen is a representative of a third way to form a rcb star .",
    "the fact that its supergiant phase is short - lived relative to life as a sdb accounts for the rarity of such hot rcbs relative to the sdb population .",
    "the presence of forbidden emission lines in dy cen s optical spectrum , was noticed in 1989 ( rao et al . 1993 ) .",
    "these lines were attributed to a nebula around dy cen . in this paper , we analyse the nebular lines and their evolution over two decades .",
    "nebular lines were especially prominent in a 2010 high - resolution spectrum with broad wavelength coverage . inspection of earlier spectra show that physical conditions in the region emitting the nebular lines have changed since 1989 . in particular , the electron density inferred from the ratio of the [ sii ] 6717 and 6731   lines increased about eight - fold from 1989 to 2010 .",
    "the general properties of dy cen s spectrum have been described by pollacco & hill ( 1991 ) , jeffery & heber ( 1993 ) , rao , giridhar & lambert ( 1993 ) , giridhar , rao & lambert ( 1996 ) and de marco et al .",
    "optical spectra are presently a combination of photospheric absorption lines ( e.g. oii , nii , siiii lines ) , emission lines due to a stellar wind ( mainly cii , hei often superposed on underlying absorption lines ) , and nebular emission lines of [ sii ] , [ nii ] , [ oi ] , [ feii ] , etc . in addition",
    ", circumstellar and interstellar lines from caii , nai , ki and other species as well as the enigmatic diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are present in absorption ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "this paper considers new spectra from 2010 acquired as a result of an eso director s discretionary proposal .",
    "the spectra were obtained on four nights in february - march 2010 with the cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph uves at the vlt at eso s paranal observatory .",
    "the uves spectrograph was used with the 1.2 `` slit ( slit length of 8 '' and p.a.=0 degrees ) and the standard setting dic2 ( 390 + 760 ) .",
    "the seeing was always better than 1.5 \" and we obtained 11 individual exposures of 1800 s each ( total exposure time of 5.5 hours ) . since the nebular lines are not expected to change in a short time , the individual exposures were combined to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the s / n in the continuum at 4000   is @xmath2200 and at wavelengths longer than 6000 it is higher than 250 .",
    "the slit width is just about the size of the nebular diameter , as estimated later .",
    "the spectral resolving power is about 37000 , as estimated from o@xmath3 telluric lines at 6970  .",
    "wavelength coverage is from 3300 to 4500  , 5700 to 7525   and 7660 to 9460  . along with dy cen , hd 115842 a nearby b supergiant",
    "was observed with the same setup .",
    "hd 115842 was observed soon after the dy cen exposures on all nights to correct for telluric lines in the dy cen spectrum .",
    "the s / n of the hd 115842 spectrum is 300 even for a single night s observation .",
    "in addition to these spectra from 2010 , we draw on a spectrum obtained in 2003 from the 3.9 m aat with the university college london echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) .",
    "the ucles spectrograph was used with the 1.4 `` slit ( slit length of 6 '' ) and three individual exposures of 1200 s each were obtained . wavelength coverage is from 4780 to 8800  .",
    "the final s / n in the summed spectrum is 38 to 40 in the continuum at 6300   to 6750   spectral region .",
    "resolving power is about 40000 as estimated from telluric [ oi ] lines .",
    "also , considered here is the 1989 spectrum used by rao et al .",
    "this was acquired at ctio with the blanco 4-meter telescope and a cassegrain echelle spectrograph .",
    "the slit width was 2 \" , which gives a resolving power of about 18000 with the wavelength coverage from 5480 to 6830   in 1989 . a 1992 spectrum with",
    "blanco telescope covered the interval 5480 to 7080   at a resolving power of 35000 ( see giridhar , rao & lambert 1996 ) .",
    "dy cen was identified as a rcb variable by hoffleit ( 1930 ) from well - determined minima in 1897 , 1901 , 1924 , and 1929 .",
    "no rcb type minima have been recorded since 1958 ( bateson 1978 , a. a. henden 2010 , private communication ) .",
    "thus , dy cen is not an active rcb star and all the spectra discussed here were taken when the star was at maximum light",
    ".    quantitative interpretation of nebular emission lines requires knowledge of the line fluxes and , hence , of the continuum fluxes across a spectrum . to obtain such fluxes",
    ", we use ubvri photometry of the star reported for the period 1989 - 2010 .",
    "dy cen has been slowly fading for the last 40 to 50 years ( bateson 1978 ; rao et al .",
    "this fading is independent of rcb - like events .",
    "we have collected ubvri photometry reported in the literature .",
    "figure 1 shows the variation of b , v , and r from 1970 to 2010 .",
    "= 8truecm    the earliest published ubv magnitudes are from mid-1970 by marino & walker ( 1971 ) : v , b - v and u - b are 12.23 , 0.39 and -0.62 , respectively .",
    "u band measurements are few and were obtained only in 1970 ( see above ) and during the 1982 - 83 period at saao by kilkenny et al .",
    "the 1972 measurements are from v.e .",
    "sherwood ( quoted by rao , giridhar & lambert 1993 ) .",
    "pollacco & hill ( 1991 ) obtained bv mesurements during 1987 may and june .",
    "the 2007 bvri measurements are from the aavso .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is a gradual increase in magnitude over 40 years .",
    "the total variation is about 0.90 magnitude in v and 0.83 magnitude in b in 37 years : the ( b - v ) colour variations are minimal .",
    "even ( u - b ) seems to be same in 1970 and 1982 - 83 .",
    "because of these very slow changes , we adopted the colours observed in 1987 for our spectroscopic observations in 1989 and the mid-2007 photometry for our 2010 spectroscopic observations to estimate continuum fluxes .",
    "the continuum fluxes are estimated from the ubvri colours after applying a correction for interstellar reddening for an e(b - v ) of 0.47 ( garca - hernndez et al .",
    "standard relations : @xmath4@xmath5 3.1 e(b - v ) and e(b - v)/e(u - b ) = 0.72 , @xmath6/ @xmath4@xmath50.75 and @xmath7/@xmath4@xmath50.479 have been used ( cardelli et al 1989 ) .",
    "flux calibrations given by drilling & landolt ( 2000 ) are adopted .",
    "reddening - corrected line fluxes are given in the table 1 for the 1989 , 1992 , 2003 , and 2010 observations . the",
    "s / n of the 2010 spectrum is over 200 to 250 .",
    "the uncertainities in equivalent widths ( eqws ) are 3% in weaker lines ( and less in strong lines like h@xmath8 ) .",
    "the photometric colours are more or less unchanged so resulting errors in flux are also expected to be around 3% or better .",
    "thus , the relative flux ratios are expected to be better than a percent .",
    "the 2003 spectrum s / n is about 40 and the uncertainty in fluxes are around 5% level .",
    "the 1989 and 1992 entries are from rao et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and giridhar et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , respectively .",
    "for some lines , corrections for blending with absorption or other emission lines are applied . in particular ,",
    "the [ sii ] 6730.8   line is blended with the cii 6731.1   absorption line on the redside , particularly on the 1989 july spectrum .",
    "a gaussian fit to the blueside of the forbidden line was used in estimating the absorption line correction .",
    "since the fwhm ( after a minor correction instrumental broadening ) agrees with the fwhm from 2010 spectrum , we suggest that proper allowance is made for the blending . in the 2010 spectra",
    "several cii lines are in emission .",
    "the emission is seen only in the core of absorption lines of the multiplet of which 6731.1   is a member ( figure 2 ) . the contribution of this line to the strong emission [ sii ] 6730.8   is fortunately minor .",
    "thus , we trust the line ratio of [ sii ] 6716   to 6731   is not unduly affected .",
    "gradual fading of dy cen seems unlikely to be due to an increased presence of dust along the line of sight to the star ; a colour variation would likely result from the dust .",
    "for a magnitude extinction the e(b - v ) change of 0.32 is expected , if the reddening law of the diffuse ism is adopted .",
    "even otherwise rcbs in recovery phases typically show a@xmath9/e(b - v ) @xmath10 4 - so one would expect a change in e(b - v ) of 0.25 .",
    "such colour changes are large and noticeable .",
    "any colour change @xmath110.1 in e(b - v ) is noticeable .",
    "we speculate that the fading may be due to the star evolving to higher temperature at constant bolometric luminosity , as expected for such stars .",
    "jeffery & heber ( 1993 ) from a spectrum obtained on 1987 april 17 derived an effective temperature of 19500 k. our 2010 spectra suggest a spectroscopic ionization / excitation temperature of 25000 k. across the temperature range 19000 k to 25000 k , ( b - v ) is insensitive to temperature : the change is only 0.07 .",
    "if the bolometric magnitude is constant , the v change over this temperature range is about 0.9 magnitude with v increasing as the effective temperature increases .",
    "this is close to the observed change in v ( and b ) .",
    "the rate of evolution may be surprisingly rapid .",
    "jeffery et al . ( 2001a ) have monitored 12 ehe stars over a period of 10 years looking for the changes in their t@xmath12 and radii .",
    "the surface of four stars was found to show heating ( contraction ) at rates between 20 and 120 degrees per year in agreement with theoretical predictions based on models by saio ( 1988 ) .",
    "dy cen , which may be considered an ehe star , shows a heating rate of 239 k degrees per year somewhat more rapid than ehe stars .",

    "this estimate is dependent on how the line of sight to the star intercepts the nebula .",
    "de marco et al .

    "in addition , the very nearby b - type star hd 115842 ( with e(b - v)=0.5 of ism identical to dy cen ) may provide a constraint that the distance should be greater than 5 kpc .",

    "thus , assuming a distance of 7 kpc for the star ( de marco et al .",

    "thus , the slit width of 1.2 arcsec used for the 2010 observations should have covered the nebular emission .",

    "note that the main electron donor is hydrogen because : i ) no nebular emission lines of he i are observed ( i.e. , no dominant nebular he i recombinations ) ; and ii ) the photoionizations of h i dominate over he i by a factor of @xmath235 .",
    "thus most of the electrons are contributed by h i.",
    "the nebula centred on dy cen , a hot rcb star , is surely intimately related to the star because its radial velocity is coincident within about one km s@xmath19 with the systemic velocity of binary system to which dy cen belongs .",
    "the nebula s expansion velocity as estimated from the width of nebular forbidden lines suggests that the nebula may have been created about 1000 years ago .",
    "spectra from 1989 to 2010 indicate that the star and the nebula are evolving . in apparent concert with an increase in the effective temperature of the star ,",
    "the electron density in the nebula has increased several - fold over the two decades sampled by available high - resolution spectra .",
    "it is quite possible that the recent formation of the nebula , the changes in nebular conditions over the preceding 20 years , and the increase in the stellar effective temperature since 1987 and the steady fading of the star at optical wavelengths are all manifestations of dy cen s past and present evolution . the nebula may be the product of an episode of common envelope evolution that resulted in a primary ( dy cen ) which became a h - deficient supergiant .",
    "such supergiants are expected to evolve rapidly to a very hot luminous star at the tip of the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "interestingly , dy cen shows a heating rate ( contraction ) more rapid than ehe stars . in either of the two present evolutionary scenarios ( white dwarf mergers or a last helium flash ) for the origin of ehe stars and rcbs",
    ", the star has to become a cooler supergiant ( for a second time ) and starts contraction at constant luminosity . whether the rate of contraction is uniform in time or not is not clear . in case of dy cen this path of evolution",
    "might not be the one the star passed through .",
    "the binarity of the star might introduce a different course ( see rao et al .",
    "2012 for some discussion ) .",
    "further observations of the star are most crucial and important in understanding the evolution of hydrogen deficient stars .",
    "one is hopeful that dy cen s future behaviour will be followed intensively spectroscopically and photometrically . in particular , it will be important to separate behaviour linked to the 39 day orbital period from the supposedly slower evolutionary trends as dy cen crossed the top of the h - r diagram .",
