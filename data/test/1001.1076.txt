    "a wide variety of cosmological observations , which include the highly precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , galactic rotation curves @xcite , the weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by foreground structure @xcite , and the weak modulation of strong lensing around individual massive elliptical galaxies @xcite , all indicate that about 22@xmath11 of our universe consists of non - baryonic , non - luminous dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the nature of dm , on the other hand , still remains a mystery .",
    "the first direct detection experiment that provided strong evidence for dark matter is the dama collaboration , which announced an 8.3 @xmath12 discovery @xcite in the annual modulations of nuclear recoil rate . in the simplest dm models , such an event rate",
    "is excluded by two orders of magnitude in other low - background nuclear experiments .",
    "a widely invoked resolution of this controversy is the inelastic dark matter ( idm ) model @xcite , which introduces a transition to an excited state in the dark matter nucleus scattering . if the mass splitting @xmath13 is roughly 100 kev , which is close to the kinetic energy of a dm in the halo , the kinematics is significantly modified and the controversy can be settled .",
    "very recently , the cryogenic dark matter search ( cdms ii ) announced the observation of two signal events with a 77@xmath11 confidence level and additional two events just outside the signal region border @xcite .",
    "statistically this is not significant to claim a discovery , nevertheless , it is very suggestive if one believe such signals are coming from dm nuclei scattering . in particular",
    ", these two events with small recoil energies suggest that the mass of dark matter is smaller than 100 gev with si cross section @xmath14 o(10@xmath15 ) pb which could escape other experimental constraints .",
    "many models have been proposed since then @xcite .",
    "in addition , limits on the dark matter nucleus cross section are obtained from the data . in the inelastic spin - independent ( isi ) dm models , only a very narrow region of parameter space",
    "is allowed @xcite , but the constraint can be large relaxed if one consider the inelastic spin - dependent ( isd ) dm models @xcite .    other experiments that give a strong constraint on the dm - nucleon cross section besides the direct detection experiments are the neutrino telescopes which are detecting the neutrino flux from dm captured and annihilated in the sun or earth .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite give the neutrino constraints to the light elastic dm ( edm ) and isi dm which could account for dama results respectively .",
    "when the dm nucleus scattering is isd , the constraints by the neutrino flux from the sun can be dramatically different .",
    "the reason is that the kinetic energy requirement for a dm ( @xmath16 ) scattering inelastically with a nucleus ( @xmath17 ) is [ eq : econdition ] e _ > ( 1 + )  . for light elements like hydrogen",
    ", only very energetic dm particles can scatter with them and get captured in the sun if @xmath13 is not very small .",
    "then the overall capture rate with their dominant contributions from light elements in the sun will be significantly reduced .",
    "the modified kinematics for inelastic scattering in eq .",
    "( [ eq : econdition ] ) also largely reduced the kinetic phase space of dm captured in the earth because of the small escape velocity of the earth .",
    "therefore , it is of importance to preform a detailed analysis regarding the above issues motivated by the recent dama , cdms results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : crsun ] , we calculate the capture rate for both isi and isd dm in the sun and we discuss the possible uncertainties in the calculation . in section [ sec : limnt ] , we obtain the constraint on the dm - nucleon inelastic cross section for different annihilation channels from super - kamiokande ( super - k ) and the expected event number from the on - going large volume neutrino telescope , icecube . in section",
    "[ sec : limearth ] , we will discuss the neutrino constraint from idm captured in the earth .",
    "finally we conclude and discuss our studies in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "when dm particles travel through the sun system , they may get trapped by the gravitational potential and continue to lose energy with every collision against nucleus and captured in the sun .",
    "the time evolution of the dm population in the sun is given by the differential equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the capture rate of the dms in the sun and annihilation rate is @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the inverse time for dm to escape via evaporation which will be neglected below since our dm is not very light . for typical dm we have considered",
    ", the time scale required to reach equilibrium between capture and annihilation , @xmath23 , is much smaller than the age of the solar system so the annihilation rate is saturated at half of the capture rate @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , calculating the dm capture rate in the sun is crucial to estimate the final neutrino flux from the sun @xcite .",
    "suppose a dm particle has a velocity @xmath25 very far away from the sun , at some point the escape velocity in a shell is @xmath26 , the dm velocity @xmath27 will be @xmath28 in the dm - nucleus center of mass frame , it is easy to see that in order to have a dm - nucleus inelastic scattering , the following condition is required @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dm - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath13 is the mass split between two dm states .",
    "the escape velocity @xmath26 is approximated as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the sun and @xmath33 km / s and @xmath34 km / s .",

    "we assume the dm velocity distribution far from the sun follows a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in the sun rest frame @xmath44 where the dimensionless variables are defined as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47220 km / s is the average local circular velocity which is related to dm velocity dispersion @xmath48 as @xmath49 .    taking into account the form factor suppression , the scattering function @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes each species of nuclei in the sun and we will omit it below , @xmath53 is the number density of the nuclei , @xmath54 is the energy transfer in the scattering , @xmath55 denotes the possible maximum(minimum ) energy transfer and @xmath56 is the minimal energy transfer which requires dm could be captured only with a velocity less than @xmath43 , and we define lower limit of integration as @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig : cap_isi_50 ] and [ fig : cap_isd_50 ] , fe and al provide most contributions to the isi and isd scattering processes respectively and one can safely neglect the hydrogen contribution in the isd scattering for @xmath98 kev .",

    "the input astrophysics parameters are the local dm mass density @xmath99 , velocity of the sun @xmath100 , average local circular velocity @xmath101 , and solar elemental abundances @xmath102 .",
    "the capture rate is proportional to @xmath99 and the results will increase if a larger local dm mass density is available @xcite or the solar system is passing through dm substructure @xcite .",

    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if these two parameters vary in the region of 200 km / s @xmath103 300 km / s , the capture rate will be changed by a factor less than two .",
    "one should also notice that , if the velocity distribution deviates from an ordinary maxwell - boltzmann distribution , the result will also be changed . in our discussions , for simplicity , we assume the solar chemical composition does not change in the sun .",
    "the capture rate is sensitive to the abundance of heavy nuclei and increasing the number density of heavy nuclei in the center of the sun will increase the overall capture rate by a few @xcite .",
    "there are also uncertainties arising from the nuclear form factor . for the si scattering ,",
    "the helm form factor we used in the calculation is less accurate at large momentum transfers and might be improved by using some more precise form factors @xcite . for the sd scattering , the nuclear structure functions in ref .",
    "@xcite are only considered for direct dm search on the earth , so the @xmath104 used in the finite momentum transfer approximation may not be large enough for dm - nucleus scattering in the sun if our dm is heavy .",
    "if the dm capture and annihilation processes reach equilibrium , we can simply get the dm annihilation rate @xmath105    the different dm annihilation channels give different initial neutrino spectra @xcite . if the dm annihilates to @xmath106 or @xmath107 , they will not contribute to neutrino signals .",
    "this is because for muons , they always lose most of their energy before decaying in the center of the sun . for annihilation channel to @xmath108 ,",

    "the hadronization process produces mesons and baryons , and then induces neutrinos via hadron decays .",
    "the neutrino spectra for such channels are soft .",
    "notice that the light mesons easily lose their energy before decays , so the contributions to the neutrino signals from light quarks are usually small .",
    "the neutrinos produced at the solar center will interact with the matter in the sun .",

    "the detector can detect up - going muons with measured path length of at least 7 m which is equivalent to the detector energy threshold 1.6 gev .",

    "icecube consisted of 22 strings has provided a more stringent upper limit to muon flux from the sun @xcite .",
    "the main shortcoming of icecube 22-strings is its high energy threshold .",

    "the complete detector consisted of 80 strings might reduce the energy threshold to 50 gev .",
    "we need to notice that the effective detecting area of icecube decreases rapidly in the low energy region .",

    "so the capability of icecube to search for light dm is weaker than that for heavy dm .",
    "but it is worth remarking , additional icecube 6 special strings named deepcore , are powerful to improve the capability of the detector and reduce the detection threshold down to 10 gev @xcite . in the fig .",

    "[ sec : limearth ] unlike the sun , the main constituents of the earth are heavy nuclei , such as o , al , si , mg , fe and ni . since the abundances of fe and al are 31.9% and 1.59% respectively , we expect that the abundance of such heavy elements helps the capture process .",
    "nevertheless , probing neutrino signals from terrestrial idm annihilations is more difficult than probing them from solar idm annihilations .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , as a gravitational system , the earth is far smaller than the sun with a rather small escape velocity , so it is more difficult to trap dm in the center of the earth . in the idm scenario ,",
    "the situation becomes even worse due to the kinetic suppression induced by inelastic capture condition .",
    "second , it is well known that terrestrial dm capture and annihilation processes can not reach equilibrium in the ordinary dm scenario , so the annihilation rate of dm trapped in the earth is even smaller than half of the capture rate .",
    "now we turn to eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) and see the first reason of suppression explicitly",
    ". we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) as @xmath144 where we use a similar notation as ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath145 and @xmath146 the escape velocity of the earth @xmath147 10 km / s is very small compared to the escape velocity of the sun @xmath148 10@xmath149 km / s and the velocity dispersion of local dm @xmath150 270 km / s , so the right hand side of the capture condition eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) is a large value . when the mass of dm is comparable to or larger than that of a nucleus , such as fe or al , the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) is suppressed by @xmath151 so it is difficult to satisfy the capture condition . if the dm is much lighter than the nuclei , the condition eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) is still not easy to satisfy .",
    "moreover it is difficult to satisfy the inelastic scattering condition eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) simultaneously .",
    "so the most promising situation is that dm and nuclei have similar masses and @xmath13 must not be large .",
    "the terrestrial idm capture and annihilation do not reach equilibrium in ordinary dm scenario.10@xmath152 @xmath38/s due to some enhancements such as sommerfeld effect , the terrestrial dm capture and annihilation could reach equilibrium @xcite . ] following from eq .",

    "it is also useful to define a critical capture rate for the earth as @xmath158 . if @xmath159 , the dm capture and annihilation in the earth could reach equilibrium .",
    "it is straightforward to get numerical results by using the method in sec ii .",
    "here we use the mass density profile and the composition of the earth provided by ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively . for simplicity , we assume the earth is in free space @xcite . if the gravitational interaction of the sun is taken into account , there is a correction factor of o(1 ) @xcite to the capture rate . in fig .",
    "[ capea ] , we show the results of terrestrial idm capture rate for si and sd scattering processes .",
    "we find that for very heavy or light dm , the capture process is highly suppressed .",
    "so we only give the capture rate for the idm with typical mass in the range of ( 10 , 50 ) gev which is similar to the mass of nuclei of interest .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there are surges as @xmath13 is varying .",
    "the peaks of these surges ( @xmath160 ) are quite similar to the  resonant enhancement \" in the edm case when dm mass reaches to the nuclei s mass as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is absent if the dm is not light enough . for the idm scenario ,",
    "we need to notice that for the n species of nuclei of interest here , there are 2n inelastic capture conditions to be satisfied or obeyed .",
    "so if the mass of dm is similar to that of the nuclei , the terrestrial capture rate is very sensitive to the parameters of @xmath161 , @xmath151 and @xmath13 .",

    "we discuss the constraints by neutrino signals from solar and terrestrial idm annihilations motivated after dama and cdms ii results .",

    "the main contribution to the capture rate in the sun is from fe / al and in the latter case , the capture from h is highly kinematically suppressed .",
    "although the types of nuclei that contribute to the capture rate are quite different in isi and isd dm models , the constraints for the idm annihilation channels for the typical dm - nucleon cross section are actually similar .",
    "the super - k null results set very stringent constraints to the hard dm annihilation channels such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for the soft channels such as @xmath137 and @xmath8 , the limits are loose . with the icecube 80-strings plus deepcore",
    ", it can discover or exclude such channels . if the dm annihilation products are light charged leptons @xmath106 , @xmath163 , light mesons or some new light bosons , there are no constraints from the neutrino detection .",
    "for neutrinos from dm annihilation in the earth , the constraint is weaker than the one in the sun .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that earth being a small gravitational system that captures the dm .",
    "moreover , the terrestrial idm capture rate is suppressed due to the inelastic capture condition .",
    "furthermore , the terrestrial idm capture and annihilation do not reach equilibrium in most of its parameter space .",
    "the constraint is available only for small @xmath13 and idm with mass of several tens of gev where similar behaviors as the  resonance enhancement \" in the edm case occur .",
    "if the dama and cdms ii results are really induced by dm , we could expect the xenon 100 @xcite or other direct detection experiments to give the similar observations in the immediate future .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints and future detection prospects we have obtained from neutrino telescope should be considered in any explanations based on idm .",

    "<S> we discuss the neutrino constraints from solar and terrestrial dark matter ( dm ) annihilations in the inelastic dark matter ( idm ) scenario after the recent cdms ii results . to reconcile the dama / libra data with constraints from all other direct experiments , the idm needs to be light ( @xmath0 gev ) and have a large dm - nucleon cross section ( @xmath1 10@xmath2 pb in the spin - independent ( si ) scattering and @xmath1 10 pb in the spin - dependent ( sd ) scattering ) . the dominant contribution to the idm capture in the sun </S>",
    "<S> is from scattering off fe / al in the si / sd case . </S>",
    "<S> current bounds from super - kamiokande exclude the hard dm annihilation channels , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for soft channels such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the limits are loose , but could be tested or further constrained by future icecube plus deepcore . for neutrino constraints from the dm annihilation in the earth , due to the weaker gravitational effect of the earth and inelastic capture condition , the constraint exists only for small mass splitting @xmath9 40 kev and @xmath10 gev even in the @xmath6 channel . </S>"
