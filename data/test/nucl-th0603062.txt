    "very unstable nuclei with unusual ratios of neutron number ( @xmath2 ) to proton number ( @xmath5 ) are currently the subject of intense theoretical and experimental work . a particularly important issue is the effect on nuclear properties of a large neutron excess and the accompanying low - lying continuum of excited states . in ground",
    "states these conditions sometimes lead to halos , thick skins , and changes in magic numbers .",
    "less is known about excited states , which we study here by calculating transition strengths and densities .",
    "most of the work on excited states is in light neutron - rich nuclei ; a low - energy strength - function peak has been studied for years .",
    "recent work @xcite has focused on enhanced @xmath4 strength in nuclei like @xmath6li or in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xcite .",
    "but in heavier nuclei , calculations are more spotty .",
    "several groups have calculated the isovector ( iv ) @xmath4 strength functions , or photoabsorption cross sections , in the ca isotopes @xcite .",
    "references @xcite predict a small peak at around @xmath7 mev in @xmath8ca .",
    "the first paper also calculates the strength function in @xmath9ca , finding no low - energy peak , but ref .",
    "@xcite , a calculation based on density - functional theory , finds a very broad bump at @xmath1010 mev .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , at what value of @xmath2 the low - energy strength is first discernible .",
    "the method we use here , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , has been applied mainly to selected @xmath4 excitations in particular isotopes of o , ca , and ni ; one example is ref.@xcite , which asserts that the low - energy excitations reflect strong particle - particle (  dineutron \" ) correlations .",
    "references @xcite show extensive and systematic qrpa calculations of photoabsorption cross sections , but focus primarily on radiative neutron - capture cross sections .",
    "the relativistic qrpa @xcite has been applied more with an eye to nuclear structure issues ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , asserting , for example , that low - lying isoscalar ( is ) @xmath4 states exhibit toroidal flow . references @xcite go beyond rpa , altering details of predicted low - lying strength .",

    "reference @xcite examines transition strengths in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 channels near the neutron drip line , finding , for example , a sharp @xmath1 peak near @xmath11 in @xmath12ni .",
    "the above represents a considerable amount of work on excitations in exotic nuclei .",
    "its range and results can be summarized , roughly , as follows : 1 ) most of the calculations are for spherical nuclei , and the iv @xmath4 channel has been studied the most .",
    "2 ) a low - energy peak grows as @xmath2 increases .",
    "3 ) the low - energy excitations do not seem collective in the @xmath4 channel ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e.  they do not contain more than a few particle - hole or two - quasiparticle configurations .",
    "4 ) the corresponding transition densities have long neutron tails extending beyond the bulk nuclear radius .",
    "5 ) the neutron skin thickness is correlated with the amount of low - energy strength @xcite .",
    "6 ) calculations reproduce measurements of the amount of low - energy strength fairly well if they include many - particle many - hole correlations @xcite .",
    "most of this work has focused on nuclei right at the drip line and , as already noted , has emphasized the iv @xmath4 channel .",
    "it is still not known whether theory makes similar predictions for other neutron - rich nuclei , or to what extent the properties of the low - energy peaks vary from one multipole to another .",
    "the purpose of this paper , therefore , is to calculate strength functions in as many nuclei as possible , in all multipoles up to @xmath1 , and investigate how the properties of the strength functions vary as @xmath2 and the multipolarity change .",
    "we use the qrpa with skyrme density functionals ( which we refer to as interactions from here on ) and volume - type delta pairing interactions .",
    "currently , the qrpa is the most sophisticated method that can be used systematically for resonances of all energies in heavy nuclei without assuming that part of the nucleus forms an inert core . here",
    "we will display results of qrpa calculations for ca , ni , and sn isotopes from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line , describing the corresponding strength functions and transition densities in detail .",

    "our approach to the qrpa is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we discuss it here only briefly . the starting point is a coordinate - space hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation , carried out with the code used in refs .",
    "the code outputs quasiparticle wave functions , with spherical symmetry assumed .",
    "it takes the continuum into account by placing the nucleus in a 20-fm box .",
    "we use as large a single - particle space as possible and solve the hfb equations accurately , so as to ease the removal of spurious states from the qrpa and satisfy sum rules .",
    "we diagonalize the hfb density matrix to obtain a set of canonical states  as many as there are quasiparticle states  that make up our qrpa basis .",
    "the qrpa - hamiltonian matrix then contains off - diagonal elements from the quasiparticle one - body hamiltonian as well as the matrix elements of the residual two - body interaction .",
    "the two - body matrix elements are functional derivatives of the energy with respect to the density and pairing tensor , after diagonalizing the qrpa hamiltonian , we use the eigenvectors to obtain strength functions @xcite and transition densities ( see appendix ) .",
    "we can not handle an infinite number of canonical quasiparticle states , and so truncate our basis in the following way : for @xmath14 the maximum single - particle angular momentum @xmath15 is 15/2 , and for @xmath16 @xmath15 is 21/2 .",
    "if the ground state has a finite pairing gap in the hfb calculation we truncate the canonical quasiparticle basis in the qrpa by omitting states with very small occupation probability @xmath17 . in the @xmath18 and @xmath4 channel",
    "we keep states with @xmath19 , and in the @xmath20 channel we keep those with @xmath21 .",

    "the separation of spurious excitations from physical states is as complete as in ref .",
    "@xcite in most of cases .",
    "we use 3 skyrme interactions : skm@xmath25 , sly4 , and skp .",
    "our pairing interaction has zero range with no density dependence ( this is `` volume pairing '' ) . for reasons we do not understand , we can not obtain solutions of the hfb equation with skp for ca and ni isotopes .",
    "the other interactions give solutions that are unstable against qrpa quadrupole vibrations for isotopes with : @xmath26 in ni ( skm@xmath25 ) ; @xmath27 ( skm@xmath25 ) and @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( sly4 ) in sn , and so we do not discuss these nuclei .",
    "strength functions are important because they capture information about all excited states and can often be measured .",
    "we define the strength functions through the transition operators    @xmath30 : @xmath31    @xmath32 : @xmath33    @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is total - nucleon number , and @xmath37 is a single - particle index .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath5 ( @xmath2 ) on a summation sign means that the sum is over protons ( neutrons ) .    in the next few sections we show the strength functions , with spurious states removed , produced by skm@xmath25 , and discuss those produced by the other skyrme interactions when appropriate .",

    "the @xmath2 dependence of the strength function of ni ( fig .  [ fig : str_ni_0 + ] ) is similar in many ways to that of ca ; the energy of the is giant - resonance energy , for example , falls in a similar way past @xmath44 .",
    "a large low - energy peak again develops near the neutron - drip line , though not as dramatically as in ca , and with the complication that the strength shrinks after @xmath45ni .",
    "this peak first is noticeable in both the is and iv channel at 6 mev in @xmath46ni , here and in calculations with sly4 .",
