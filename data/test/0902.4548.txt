    "over the last few years , several methods have been developed to cool molecules to temperatures below 1 degree kelvin .",
    "these include buffer - gas cooling in cryogenic helium @xcite , stark deceleration with switched electric fields @xcite , velocity filtering @xcite , optical deceleration with laser fields @xcite , and crossed molecular beam scattering @xcite .",
    "the availability of cold molecules opens up a new field of low - energy collision studies , in a novel regime where collisions are dominated by long - range forces and resonances .",
    "stark decelerators can be used to _ control _ beam velocity as well as to reduce it @xcite .",
    "pulsed molecular beams can be generated with much smaller velocity spreads than is possible with conventional supersonic sources .",
    "this offers the opportunity to study scattering resonances at much higher resolution than has been possible in the past .",
    "_ @xcite have carried out a proof - of - concept experiment in which a velocity - controlled beam of oh radicals collided with xe atoms in a jet . in this case the energy resolution of the experiment was limited to 13 @xmath1 by the velocity spread of the xe atoms .",
    "however , experiments are under way to collide two velocity - controlled beams , which will provide much higher resolution .",
    "an alternative approach is to collide a beam with a sample of trapped atoms or molecules that are already nearly at rest .",
    "_ @xcite have recently measured collision cross sections for he atoms and h@xmath3 molecules in pulsed beams colliding with magnetically trapped oh radicals , and achieved a resolution of 9 @xmath1 . experiments to investigate the collisions of a velocity - controlled beam of nd@xmath0 with trapped ultracold rb atoms are also under way , and again should be able to provide much better velocity resolution .",
    "scattering resonances in molecular collisions have been studied for many years @xcite and can be very important in chemical reactions @xcite . in simple systems where only a few partial waves contribute , they may produce sharp structures in cross sections as a function of collision energy @xcite .",
    "however , in more complicated systems with dense energy level patterns , the resonant structures may get lost in the background .",
    "it is therefore important to explore whether well - defined resonant structures are expected for collisions of molecules that can be velocity - controlled ( such as nd@xmath0 and oh ) and atoms that can be laser - cooled ( such as alkali metal atoms ) .    in this paper",
    "we study collisions of rb atoms with nd@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 for collision energies between 0 and 100 @xmath1 .",
    "we carry out quantum - mechanical calculations of integral elastic and state - to - state inelastic cross sections using the coupled states approximation and observe numerous scattering resonances .",
    "to understand the nature of the scattering processes , we study the resonance structure of the scattering cross sections for individual partial waves .",
    "the resonances can be explained in terms of the bound states of the rb ",
    "nh@xmath0 complex .",
    "we calculate the pattern of bound states near the lowest dissociation limits of the complex as a function of the end - over - end angular momentum and identify the bound states responsible for the resonances .",
    "there is a further reason for being interested in rb  nh@xmath0 collisions .",
    "methods such as stark deceleration can slow molecules to velocities of a few metres per second , and the resulting molecules can then be trapped at temperatures of 10 to 100 mk @xcite .",
    "it has not yet proved possible to cool such molecules further , towards the temperatures and phase space densities at which they might undergo condensation to form quantum gases .",
    "there is great interest in methods that might be used to achieve this , and one of the most promising is _ sympathetic cooling _",
    "@xcite , in which molecules are cooled by thermal contact with a laser - cooled gas of atoms such as rb .",
    "however , sympathetic cooling can work only if the collisions are predominantly elastic rather than inelastic : if the molecules are in excited states and undergo inelastic ( deexcitation ) collisions , the kinetic energy released is usually enough to eject both collision partners from the trap .",
    "we therefore also carry out calculations of elastic and inelastic cross sections at the temperatures relevant to sympathetic cooling .",
    "in previous work we obtained the potential energy surface for nh@xmath0 interacting with rb from highly correlated electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "spin - restricted coupled - cluster calculations including single , double and perturbative triple excitations [ rccsd(t ) ] were carried out on a grid of points in the intermolecular distance @xmath4 and intermolecular angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the angle @xmath6 corresponds to rotation of nh@xmath0 about its @xmath7 axis .",
    "the angles @xmath8 were chosen to be the points for 20-point gauss - lobatto quadrature , which include @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with @xmath9 corresponding to approach toward the lone pair of nh@xmath0 ) .",
    "calculations were carried out on a grid of @xmath4 values from 3.5 to 25 @xmath11 and for two azimuthal angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    for collision calculations , we need to evaluate matrix elements of the interaction potential between angular momentum basis functions .",

    "nd@xmath0 collision energies up to 2 @xmath1 , where there are very strong resonances .",
    "the bottom panel shows the s - matrix eigenphase sums @xcite for @xmath131 , which show a sharp rise through @xmath136 as the energy passes through a resonance .    in general each partial inelastic cross section shows a non - resonant peak near the corresponding barrier maximum and then dies off at higher energies .",
    "the non - resonant peak is quite sharp for low @xmath91 but broadens as @xmath91 increases . in particular , the peaks below @xmath137 @xmath1 for @xmath138 are non - resonant .",
    "superimposed on the non - resonant background are peaks and troughs due to resonances . below the barrier maximum , both shape and feshbach resonances may occur ; however peaks due to feshbach resonances are suppressed when they are below barriers and it is usually shape resonances that give large peaks in this region .    above the barrier maximum for each @xmath91",
    ", langevin capture theory would predict a partial inelastic cross section @xmath139 except at resonances and occasionally near the barrier maximum , the partial cross sections are generally much smaller than this .",
    "it is thus evident that low - energy inelastic scattering in rb ",
    "nd@xmath0 is _ dominated _ by resonant effects .",
    "we also carried out bound - state calculations close to the @xmath2 thresholds to help identify the states responsible for the resonances .",
    "the bound - state calculations used the coupled - states approximation with the same basis set as for the collision calculations .",
    "the helicity was restricted to @xmath133 since this is the only value that contributes to the @xmath140 cross section .",
    "the resulting bound states are shown in fig .",
    "[ bnd ] . since the rotational energy of the bound and quasibound states of the rb ",
    "nd@xmath0 complex is approximately proportional to @xmath134 , it is convenient to plot the energies as a function of this quantity .",
    "this allows rotational progressions to be identified as nearly straight lines , and rotational constants can be extracted from the slopes of the lines .",
    "however , if there are two or more bound states for the same @xmath91 with energies very close together , they can mix and avoid one another ; an example of this is shown by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ bnd ] .    most of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ jexp ] can be identified with series of bound states .",
    "for example , the cross sections for @xmath141 shows three strong peaks .",
    "the first of these , at about 0.5 @xmath1 , is a nonresonant peak associated with the barrier maximum . at higher energies are two resonant peaks , labeled as i , and ii in fig .",
    "they are associated with characteristic features in the eigenphase sum and can be identified as feshbach resonances associated with the series of bound states along the dashed lines i and ii in fig .",
    "[ bnd ] ; series ii also explains the strong peak in the cross section for @xmath142 near 0.6 @xmath1 .",
    "lines i and ii both have a large slope , corresponding to a rotational constant @xmath143 @xmath1 and an effective distance between rb and nd@xmath0 around @xmath144 .",
    "it is also not difficult to assign the resonances labeled by iv , v , vi and vii to the appropriate series of bound states ; all these are feshbach resonances that arise from bound states with small effective intermolecular distances @xmath145 .",
    "for all these bound states , inspection of the wavefunction near the van der waals minimum confirms that they are dominated by rotationally excited basis functions with @xmath146 .",
    "the levels along the line iii in fig .",
    "[ bnd ] , which give strong resonances for @xmath147 and 9 , are associated with quasibound states of significantly smaller rotational constant , @xmath148 @xmath1 , and an effective intermolecular distance around 20 @xmath11 .",
    "the dominant contributions to the wavefunction in this case are the two @xmath2 states ; the @xmath83 and @xmath84 states contribute almost equally and with opposite signs , corresponding to a single umbrella state of non - inverting nd@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that these are shape resonances , and indeed for @xmath147 and 9 they lie below the energy of the centrifugal barrier , shown as a dashed curve in fig .  [ bnd ] . for @xmath149",
    "the extrapolated energy of line iii is above the barrier maximum and no well - defined shape resonances occur .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the absolute energies of the resonances and bound states close to threshold are strongly dependent on the potential energy surface .",
    "thus , the studies reported in this section should be treated as a paradigm for understanding the resonant behavior of cross sections , rather than as predictions of the actual energies at which resonances will appear for rb  nd@xmath0 .",
    "as described in the introduction , there is great interest in the possibility of _ sympathetic cooling _ , in which molecules are cooled by thermal contact with a gas of laser - cooled atoms such as rb .",
    "the simplest sympathetic cooling experiment would overlap an electrostatic trap containing a sample of cold molecules such as nd@xmath0 with a gas of atoms in a magnetic or magneto - optical trap .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to explore collision cross sections for promising candidate atoms and molecules in the temperature regime between 1 @xmath43k and 100 mk .",
    "an electrostatic trap works only for molecules in low - field - seeking states , and for nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 the low - field - seeking states correlate at low field with the upper state of the tunneling doublet .",
    "it is thus very important to know whether collisions with ultracold rb will cause relaxation to the lower tunneling state , which is a high - field - seeking state and can not be trapped electrostatically .",
    "more specifically , we need to know whether the cross section for the relaxation from @xmath90 to @xmath89 state is sufficiently small compared to the elastic cross section .    to explore this",
    "we have performed close - coupling calculations for very low energies using the same rotational basis set as for the cs calculations described above . in fig .",
    "[ ultracold ] we show the elastic and total inelastic integral cross sections calculated for partial waves @xmath113 to 8 , which gives reasonable convergence for collision energies up to 100 mk .",
    "the contribution to the total cross sections from @xmath150-wave scattering ( @xmath111 partial wave ) is dominant in the @xmath43k regime .",
    "the wigner threshold behavior for @xmath150-wave scattering is followed for kinetic energies up to about 100@xmath43k .",
    "elastic cross sections are larger than inelastic cross sections for collision energies above 100 @xmath43k , but never by much more than a factor of 10 . for",
    "sympathetic cooling , the commonly stated rule of thumb is that the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections should be at least 100 .",
    "thus it appears that the inelastic cross sections are too large to allow nd@xmath0 molecules in low - field - seeking states to be cooled to sub - mk temperatures by collision with ultracold rb atoms .     and inelastic @xmath100 cross sections and the contribution from @xmath150-wave scattering ( @xmath111 ) , from close - coupling calculations . ]",
    "there remains the possibility of using sympathetic cooling for molecules in high - field - seeking states , which can be confined using an alternating current trap @xcite .",
    "confinement of rb atoms in such a trap has also been demonstrated @xcite , but the ac frequencies required are quite different in the two cases .",
    "it is therefore important to know whether sympathetic cooling of nd@xmath0 molecules in high - field - seeking states might be feasible using magnetically trapped rb atoms , which are themselves in low - field - seeking states that are not the ground state in the applied magnetic field . in previous work on rb ",
    "oh collisions @xcite , we found large cross sections for low - energy collisions that changed the hyperfine state of rb .",
    "we initially anticipated @xcite that this would occur for rb ",
    "nd@xmath0 collisions as well .",
    "however , the more thorough analysis of the collision hamiltonian in section ii.b above suggests that for molecules in closed - shell singlet states the atomic spins are likely to be almost unaffected by collisions .",
    "we therefore now consider that sympathetic cooling of high - field - seeking states of nd@xmath0 ( or nh@xmath0 ) by magnetically trapped rb ( or another laser - cooled atomic gas ) has a good prospect of success .",
    "collision calculations at ultralow kinetic energies are very sensitive to details of the potential used in the calculations .",
    "quantitative theoretical predictions of parameters related to scattering cross sections , such as the highest bound states or scattering lengths , are possible only for the simplest , lightest systems such as metastable helium @xcite or hydrogen - lithium mixtures @xcite . the calculated rb ",
    "nh@xmath0 interaction potential we use in this paper suffers from many uncertainties resulting from incompleteness of the electronic basis set , the approximate treatment of electronic correlation , relativistic effects , etc . , which limit its accuracy to at best a few percent .    to explore this sensitivity",
    ", we introduce an additional scaling factor @xmath151 into the definition of the interaction potential .",
    "we varied the scaling factor between 0.90 and 1.05 and explored the variation of the @xmath150-wave elastic @xmath86 and inelastic @xmath93 cross sections ( using close - coupling calculations ) for a collision energy of 10 @xmath43k .",
    "the results for a representative slice of the range of @xmath151 studied are shown in fig .",
    "[ scalingparam ] .",
    "the elastic and inelastic cross sections vary dramatically as bound states cross threshold and appear as scattering resonances . in the range of @xmath151",
    "explored , the elastic and inelastic cross sections pass through more than ten resonances .",
    "there are some values of @xmath151 , such as near @xmath152 , where the inelastic cross section @xmath93 is significantly suppressed by the presence of a strong resonance , but for most other values of the scaling parameter the elastic - to - inelastic ratio ranges lies between 10 and 0.1 .",
    "although it is possible that the real potential might produce inelastic cross sections low enough to allow sympathetic cooling for low - field - seeking states , it is quite unlikely .     and inelastic @xmath100 cross sections for rb ",
    "nd@xmath0 at a collision energy of 10 @xmath43k to a scaling factor @xmath151 applied to the interaction potential . ]",
    "we have studied collisions between rb atoms and nh@xmath0/nd@xmath0 molecules , motivated by recent progress @xcite in collision experiments involving velocity - controlled and stark - decelerated beams of molecules and by interest in the possibility of sympathetic cooling .",
    "we focused principally on nh@xmath0 or nd@xmath0 molecules initially in the upper component of the inversion doublet for @xmath81 , @xmath73 .",
    "this level correlates with the low - field - seeking state in an electric field , which can be slowed by stark deceleration and trapped in an electrostatic trap .",
    "we considered collision energies between 0 and 100 @xmath1 . using the coupled - states approximation , we calculated the elastic cross sections and state - to - state inelastic cross sections from the low - field - seeking @xmath2 state to other rotation - inversion levels .",
    "the inelastic cross sections are smaller than expected for such a strongly coupled system , but are still only about a factor of 10 smaller than the elastic cross section over most of the energy range considered .",
    "both the elastic and inelastic cross sections show dense structure due to scattering resonances .",
    "the resonances in the elastic cross sections are diffuse and rather weak compared to the background .",
    "the total inelastic cross sections have much stronger resonances compared to their background , especially at collision energies below about 20 @xmath1 and one can consider the inelastic scattering as _ mostly _ resonant in nature .",
    "these resonances are washed out for larger collision energies . for energies below 90 @xmath1",
    "the @xmath100 inelastic cross section makes the largest contribution to the total inelastic cross section .",
    "transitions to @xmath153 and 3 do not change the total inelastic cross section significantly as the new channels become energetically accessible at higher collision energies .",
    "we have considered the origin of the scattering resonances , using calculations of the bound states of rb  nd@xmath0 near threshold . since the long - range attraction between rb and nd@xmath0 is very strong and the reduced mass is fairly large , the resulting centrifugal barriers are much smaller than in lighter systems .",
    "most of the resonances appearing in the cross sections arise from quasibound states in which rb interacts with rotationally excited nh@xmath0 , and can be classified as feshbach resonances .",
    "finally we studied the ultracold limit of the elastic and inelastic cross sections , in order to test whether low - field - seeking molecules could be cooled to microkelvin temperatures by contact with an ultracold gas of rb atoms .",
    "hyperfine effects were neglected .",
    "we found that inelastic collisions are strong , and the elastic / inelastic ratio is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve sympathetic cooling of nd@xmath0 molecules in the @xmath90 state .",
    "however , there is a good prospect that sympathetic cooling will be possible for high - field - seeking states of nd@xmath0 or nh@xmath0 , even if the atoms used as a coolant are in low - field - seeking states .",
