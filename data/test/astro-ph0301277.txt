    "since there are no large systematically selected samples of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) with redshifts available yet , the derivation of their luminosity function requires a luminosity criterion to estimate the redshifts . in this paper",
    ", we use the results of five recent studies using one or more luminosity criteria to compare the resulting luminosity functions and to derive from each the expected source counts and the euclidean value of @xmath0 .",
    "these studies are presented in detail in fenimore and ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) ( fr ) , schmidt ( 2001 ) ( s ) , schaefer , deng and band ( 2001 ) ( sdb ) , lloyd - ronning , fryer , and ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 ) ( lfr ) , and norris ( 2002 ) ( n ) .",
    "the luminosity criteria used in these studies are variability ( fr , sdb , lfr ) , spectral lag ( sdb , n ) and spectral hardness ( s ) .",
    "references to original work on these luminosity criteria are given in the individual papers .",
    "our use of the spectral hardness was based on its correlation with @xmath0 ( schmidt 2001 ) , which we interpreted in terms of a correlation between the peak luminosity of grbs and the observed photon spectral index @xmath2 ( based on batse channels 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this appears to be supported by the correlation of the isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath3 and @xmath2 shown in figure 1 .",
    "the data used are based on bepposax observations of 12 grbs with redshifts ( amati et al .",
    "we derived the values of @xmath2 from those given for the band @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters and the redshift .",
    "it is curious , however , that no correlation is seen between @xmath3 and either the band @xmath4 or @xmath5 parameter .",
    "generally , the authors used one or two luminosity criteria to assign peak luminosities to each grb in a sample complete above a stated flux limit .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath6 was then derived , see the references . since lfr and n gave only the luminosity distribution of their samples , we derived the luminosity function using the spectral properties and cosmological parameters adopted by the authors .",
    "the redshift dependence or cosmological evolution of @xmath6 derived or adopted in four of the studies was a density evolution @xmath7 up to redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "lfr concluded that in addition there was luminosity evolution @xmath9 .",
    "n did not consider any evolution .",
    "details about the application of the luminosity criteria , and the evolution of the luminosity function can be found in the individual papers .",
    "finally , since not all luminosity functions were given in terms of numbers per unit volume per unit time , we applied a normalization factor such that , following the procedure discussed in the next section , each produces a rate of 53 grbs per year above a photon flux of 5 ph @xmath10 s@xmath11 .",
    "figure 2 shows the luminosity functions @xmath6 at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to the peak luminosity @xmath14 at a time resolution of 1024 ms .",
    "the cosmological parameters used are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the n luminosity function extends to @xmath18 where its ordinate is @xmath19 .",
    "the five luminosity functions show considerable divergence , partly caused by differences in the cosmological evolution .",
    "for a given luminosity function @xmath6 , the source counts @xmath20 as a function of photon flux @xmath21 can be derived ( see schmidt 2001 ) .",
    "we show in figure 3 the resulting expected source counts for the five luminosity functions .",
    "also shown are the observed counts based on the bd2 sample of grbs described in schmidt ( 1999 ) .",
    "even though we had normalized the five luminosity functions ( see section 2 ) , the expected source counts show considerable divergence .",
    "the counts for n are very flat , probably a consequence of not including any cosmological evolution . at low values of @xmath21",
    "the other four predicted counts are high , only partially caused by the incompleteness of the counts setting in for @xmath22 ph @xmath10 s@xmath11 .",
    "obviously , most of the curves have no predictive value in estimating the number of grbs that may be detected by future deep missions .",
    "the euclidean value of @xmath0 , which to first order characterizes the steepness of the source counts @xmath20 , has the advantage that it accounts for the variation of sensitivity over a survey .",
    "we have derived @xmath0 for each of the luminosity functions , where for the individual sources @xmath23 .",
    "we use for the limiting photon flux @xmath24 ph @xmath10",
    "s@xmath11 , which characterizes both the bd2 sample and the batse catalog . the results are given in figure 3 .",
    "conservatively assuming that the observed value @xmath25 has an r.m.s .",
    "error of @xmath26 ( schmidt 2001 ) , we see that four of the predicted values deviate by @xmath1 sigmas .",
    "the agreement for s reflects the fact that @xmath0 for each spectral class was used directly to set its contribution to the luminosity function .",
    "the key to understanding the systematics of figure 3 is twofold .",
    "first , the euclidean value of @xmath0 is a distance indicator for uniformly distributed cosmological objects ( schmidt 2001 ) .",
    "second , @xmath0 is larger for objects with stronger positive cosmological evolution .",
    "hence , if the expected value of @xmath0 is larger than the observed one , the model luminosities @xmath13 are too low and/or the cosmological evolution is too strong ( see schmidt 1999 , table 1 ) .",
    "since the observed value of @xmath0 is known quite accurately , important information about @xmath6 is missed if it is not used .",
    "we recommend that any study of @xmath6 take into account the euclidean value of @xmath0 .",
