    "heavy quarkonia are an excellent tool to study the modifications of the basic qcd force in hot / dense matter . in vacuum ,",
    "potential models provide a theoretically controlled and phenomenologically successful spectroscopy , serving as a calibrated starting point to utilize quarkonium properties in medium as a probe  @xcite . however , the realization of such a program in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) is a non - trivial task .",
    "the interplay of color screening and dissociation reactions in a locally equilibrated , yet evolving medium , as well as off - equilibrium aspects in initial conditions and in heavy - quark ( hq ) kinetics , result in a rather complex problem . a viable theoretical framework to properly interpret experimental data must therefore be able to account for these aspects , while maintaining the connection to theoretically calculated in - medium properties",
    ". in particular , it should be able to encompass both charmonium and bottomonium observables , and a large range in collision energies , as are now available .    in sec .",

    "[ sec_pheno ] we discuss applications to charmonium ( [ ssec_psi ] ) and bottomonium ( [ ssec_ups ] ) data , mostly comparing predictions to recent lhc data .",

    "starting from the boltzmann equation one can integrate out the space and 3-momentum dependencies to obtain a rate equation for the quarkonium number , @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "this form renders the relation to the  transport \" parameters particularly transparent .",
    "the equilibrium abundance , @xmath3 , depends on the quarkonium mass , @xmath4 and binding energy , @xmath5 , as well as on the hq mass , @xmath6 , via relative chemical equilibrium at fixed hq number .",
    "the temperature dependence of these quantities is taken from a @xmath7-matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath3 is corrected for off - equilibrium hq distributions ( which suppress the formation rate ) using a relaxation - time approximation ( which has been verified to work well  @xcite ) .",
    "the pertinent @xmath8 is one of the parameters of the approach .",
    "the type of the inelastic reaction rate , @xmath9 , depends on the relation of @xmath5 to @xmath7 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "quasifree dissociation prevails ( landau damping of the exchanged gluon ) , while for larger @xmath7 gluo - dissociation ( singlet - to - octet transitions ) takes over .",
    "we adopt the former ( latter ) for charmonia ( bottomonia ) , where the precise value of the coupling constant is utilized as a second fit parameter . the resulting charmonium  @xcite and bottomonium  @xcite spectral functions are checked against euclidean correlators from lattice qcd . the initial conditions of the rate equation consist of the numbers of ( would - be formed ) quarkonia and heavy quarks , corrected for  cold - nuclear - matter \" effects ( shadowing , cronin effect and nuclear absorption ) .",
    "they are determined from available experimental cross sections or interpolations thereof .",
    "the evolving medium is modeled by an expanding thermal fireball constrained by hadro - chemistry , hadron yields and spectra .",
    "the quarkonium ground and excited states are evolved with their individual binding energies and reaction rates , to account for feeddown .",
    "the simultaneous study of charmonium and bottomonium observables in urhics is particularly valuable , since the differences in charmonium and bottomonium binding ( aka screening effects ) , as well as in open - charm and open - bottom content ( aka reaction rates ) enable a much improved discrimination power of bound - state suppression and regeneration mechanisms .      in ref .",
    "@xcite we have employed the above - described framework to conduct a systematic analysis of @xmath11 data in pb - pb and au - au collisions at top sps ( @xmath12=17.3agev ) and rhic ( @xmath12=200 agev ) energies , respectively .",
    "we have investigated both a strong- and a weak - binding scenario , where the former describes the data slightly better and gives values for our two parameters consistent with the @xmath7-matrix approach  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath13@xmath140.3 in the quasifree dissociation rate and @xmath15@xmath145fm/@xmath16 for the kinetic charm - quark relaxation time .",
    "we will therefore focus on this scenario from here on .",
    "predictions have then been made for lhc and lower rhic energies .",
    "for the latter , the centrality dependence of the total nuclear modification factor , @xmath17 , has little @xmath12 dependence , consistent with recent phenix data  @xcite .",

    "the agreement with recent alice dimuon data ( at somewhat forward rapidity ) is fair , cf .",
    "[ fig_jpsi ] .",
    "in particular , the tell - tale signature of the regeneration component at low transverse momentum is confirmed .",
    "very similar results are obtained in the transport approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which differs in details of the implementation , but overall asserts the robustness of the conclusions .",
    "the statistical hadronization model also accounts for the centrality dependence of the @xmath11 yield  @xcite , using somewhat smaller charm cross sections than used in the transport models .",
    "this is due to the off - equilibrium effects in the latter .",
    "another signature of regenerated charmonia is the collectivity that they inherit from the charm quarks , which is much larger than from path - length type suppression effects .",
    "however , as is well known , a large radial flow suppresses the @xmath18 of heavy particles at low @xmath19 , which is unfortunately where the regeneration contributes most .",
    "nevertheless , first lhc data show a promising signal ( fig .",

    "indeed , the resulting @xmath20 @xmath21 agrees reasonably well with cms data in the strong - binding scenario ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ups ] ) , but is suppressed too much in the weak - binding scenario . on the other hand , @xmath22 is strongly suppressed even in the former ( fig .",

    "a kinetic - rate equation approach , implementing in - medium quarkonium properties into a thermal bulk - evolution model , is found to provide a suitable tool ( with predictive power ) to interpret @xmath11 and @xmath23 observables in urhics . in particular , a gradual increase of regeneration contributions to @xmath11 production from sps via rhic to lhc is supported by recent lhc data , showing an increase in @xmath21 .",
    "the associated low-@xmath19 enhancement and @xmath18 signal corroborate this interpretation .",
    "bottomonium observables , while possibly not free of regeneration , give a more direct access to the in - medium qcd force ; the moderate suppression of @xmath20 at lhc ( and rhic ) suggests that a strong binding potential persists into the qgp , which may well be related to a small hq diffusion coefficient .",
