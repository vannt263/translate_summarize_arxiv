    "due to their high coercivity , single - domain nanoparticles exhibit long - range stability of the magnetization and thereby that of the information stored in recording media .",
    "the storage density may be increased by using very small particles , but then surface effects become dominant and affect the magnetization relaxation . therefore , one of our aims is to include surface effects in the calculation of the relaxation time of the particle magnetization . however",
    ", this requires a microscopic approach to account for the local environment inside the particle , and thus include microscopic interactions such as spin - spin exchange , in addition to anisotropy and applied field .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to a rather difficult task owing to the large number of degrees of freedom which hinders any attempt to analyze the energyscape .",
    "for this reason , inter alia , calculations of the reversal time of the magnetization of fine single - domain ferromagnetic particles , initiated by nel @xcite , and set firmly in the context of the theory of stochastic processes by brown @xcite , have invariably ignored all kind of interactions and included only the internal anisotropy of the particle , the random field due to thermal fluctuations , and the zeeman term . in 1968",
    "langer @xcite came up with a general approach to the calculation of the reaction rate of a system with @xmath6 degrees of freedom , which is a powerful method of attack on the problem of interaction . within this approach the problem of calculating the relaxation time for a multi - dimensional process",
    "is reduced to solving a steady - state fokker - planck equation ( ssfpe ) in the immediate neighborhood of the saddle point that the system crosses as it goes from a metastable state to another state of greater stability .",
    "the idea is that a steady - state situation can be set up by continuously replenishing the metastable state at a rate equal to the rate at which it is leaking across the activation energy barrier .",
    "a brief review of the main steps and application to the problem at hand are given after eq .",
    "( [ gamma_tsp ] ) , see also @xcite for uniform and non - uniform magnetization , and @xcite for comparison with kramers theory",
    ". however , langer s approach is only valid in the limit of intermediate - to - high damping ( ihd ) because of the inherent assumption that the potential energy in the vicinity of the saddle point may be approximated by its second - order taylor expansion .",
    "the result for small damping fails because the region of deviation from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution set up in the well extends far beyond the narrow region at the top of the barrier .",
    "the problem associated with the generalization of brown s theory to include interactions is rather difficult and can in general be solved only numerically .",
    "but before attacking this problem , one needs to understand the effect of exchange interaction on the relaxation time of the minimal system , i.e. , for a pair of atomic spins coupled via exchange interaction , including of course the usual magneto - crystalline anisotropy and zeeman terms .",
    "besides , in the case of exchange interaction , this is the unique non - trivial step towards the above - mentioned generalization , where analytical expressions can be obtained for the relaxation time .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to solve this problem within langer s approach and to compare with the nel - brown result for the one - spin problem . as a byproduct",
    ", we will show that langer s",
    "quadratic approximation at the saddle point fails when the exchange coupling assumes a  critical value \" even in the ihd limit . in this case ,",
    "finiteness of the relaxation rate requires a higher - order expansion of the energy near the saddle point .",
    "the generalization to a multi - spin particle will be briefly discussed at the end .",
    "we finally mention that the effect of dipolar interactions on the relaxation time has been considered by a few authors . in refs .",
    "@xcite approximate analytical expressions were obtained for the relaxation time in various situations of assemblies of magnetic moments . in ref .",
    "@xcite a pair of coupled dipoles was dealt with using the ( numerical ) langevin approach .",
    "we consider a system of two exchange - coupled spins with the hamiltonian @xmath7 -\\vec{h}\\cdot(\\vec{s}_{1}+\\vec{s}_{2 } ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & j\\equiv j / k,\\ , h\\equiv h/2k   \\label{hts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the exchange coupling , @xmath9 the anisotropy constant , @xmath1 the applied magnetic field , and @xmath10 the reduced field , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 are uniaxial anisotropy unit vectors . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath13 . owing to the symmetry of this system with respect to rotations around the easy axis",
    ", the number of variables reduces to three , @xmath14 .",
    "now we apply langer s approach to the energy ( [ hts ] ) and study the relaxation rate as a function of the exchange coupling @xmath15 .",
    "we first analyze the energyscape in fig .",
    "[ enscape ] .",
    "the absolute minimum of the energy ( [ hts ] ) corresponds to the ferromagnetic order along the easy axis , @xmath16 where henceforth @xmath17 denotes the energy of the state .",
    "one metastable state corresponds to a ferromagnetic order opposite to the field @xmath18 there is also the metastable state of anti - ferromagnetic order , @xmath19 as to saddle points , we find that their number and loci crucially depend on the exchange coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath20 , there is a single saddle point given by @xmath21 whereas for @xmath22 there are two saddle points given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 with energy , @xmath26 at @xmath27 the saddle point ( [ sp21 ] ) with @xmath28 merges with the saddle point ( [ sp0 ] ) , while that with @xmath29 merges with the metastable state ( [ afm ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ enscape ] central panel .",
    "starting with both spins aligned in the metastable state ( [ mfm ] ) with @xmath30 , if @xmath22 one of the two spins crosses the saddle point ( [ sp21])(@xmath28 ) into the state ( [ afm ] ) by reversing its direction .",
    "then the second spin follows through the second saddle point ( [ sp21])(@xmath29 ) , of lower energy due to the exchange coupling ( see fig .  [ rate ] ( left ) ) , ending up in the stable state ( [ sfm ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ enscape ] ( left ) the path is indicated by a pair of curved arrows .",
    "there are actually two such paths corresponding to the two - fold symmetry of the problem owing to the full identity of the two spins .",
    "note that when the first spin starts to switch and arrives at @xmath31 , the second spin has @xmath32 ( hence the curved arrows in fig .",
    "[ enscape ] ) , which suggests that in the switching process of the first spin , the position of the second spin undergoes some fluctuations creating a small transverse field , and when @xmath33 the second spin goes back to the position @xmath34 before it proceeds to switch in turn .",
    "the successive switching of the two spins through the corresponding saddle points is a sequential two - step process , similarly , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reversal of the two dipoles considered is a two - stage process with an intermediary metastable antiparallel state .",
    "] so the relaxation rates for @xmath22 add up inverse - wise . in the case",
    "@xmath35 the two spins cross the unique saddle point ( [ sp0 ] ) to go from the metastable state ( [ mfm ] ) into the stable one ( [ sfm ] ) in a single step , see fig .",
    "[ enscape ] ( right ) where the path is indicated by a single straight arrow .",
    "there is the symmetry @xmath36 , which leads to a factor of 2 in the relaxation rate .",
    "therefore , if we denote by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the respective relaxation rates , the relaxation rate of the two - spin system is given by @xmath40 in langer s approach the @xmath41s are obtained from the ssfpe linearized around each saddle point , using the fluctuating variables @xmath42 where @xmath43 , or more adequately the  canonical \" variables @xmath44 with @xmath45 , in which the energy hessian is diagonal .",
    "the deterministic dynamics of the system is governed by the landau - lifshitz equations , which upon linearization near the saddle point , read @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the quadratic approximation of the energy ( [ hts ] ) near the saddle point and @xmath48 is the damping parameter . in matrix form eqs .",
    "( [ linlle ] ) become @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the dynamic matrix containing the precessional and dissipative parts . rather than investigating the stochastic trajectories",

    "( [ linlle ] ) , langer concentrates on the distribution function @xmath52 as the probability that the system is found in the configuration @xmath53 at time @xmath54 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath55 is governed by the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) @xmath56 , which is a continuity equation with the probability current @xmath57 given , near the saddle point , by @xmath58 in order to calculate the nucleation rate , one must solve the fpe .",
    "a particular solution is obtained at equilibrium and is given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath59 , which corresponds to zero current , @xmath60 .",
    "however , what is really needed is a finite probability current flowing across the saddle point .",
    "in fact , instead of solving the time - dependent fpe , langer solves the ssfpe @xmath61 near the saddle point .",
    "the steady - state situation may be realized by imposing the boundary conditions : @xmath62 near the metastable state and @xmath63 beyond the saddle point .",
    "then , the problem of calculating the escape rate reduces to the calculation of the total current by integrating the probability current @xmath64 over a surface through the saddle point .",
    "this led langer to his famous expression for the relaxation rate which is valid in the ihd limit .",
    "however , since the escape rate is simply given by the ratio of the total current through the saddle point to the number of particles in the metastable state , langer s result for the escape rate can in fact be achieved by only computing the energy - hessian eigenvalues near the saddle points and metastable states , from which one then infers the partition function @xmath65 of the system restricted to the region around the saddle point where the energy - hessian negative eigenvalue is ( formally ) taken with absolute value , and the partition function @xmath66 of the region around the metastable state .",
    "when computing these partition functions , one has to identify and take care of each goldstone mode , that is a massless mode or zero - energy fluctuation associated with a continuous unbroken global symmetry . finally , one computes the unique is unstable @xcite . ]",
    "negative eigenvalue @xmath67 of the ssfpe corresponding to the unstable mode at the saddle point as the negative eigenvalue of the dynamic matrix @xmath68 , where the @xmath69 s are the eigenvalues of the hessian at the saddle point and @xmath70 is the transformation matrix from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , langer s final expression for the escape rate is rewritten in the following somewhat more practical form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the attempt frequency which contains the damping parameter @xmath48 .",
    "now , we give the different relaxation rates for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .    * relaxation rate for @xmath35 * : the quadratic expansion of the energy ( [ hts ] ) at the saddle point ( [ sp0 ] ) reads , @xmath77 with zero eigenvalue for the @xmath78 mode , that is the goldstone mode associated with the rotation around the easy axis .",

    "the partition function @xmath66 at the metastable state ( [ mfm ] ) is computed by expanding the energy up to @xmath87 order , leading to @xmath88 using eq .",
    "( [ gammapr ] ) and inserting the symmetry factor of @xmath89 , the relaxation rate for @xmath90 reads @xmath91 for @xmath92 ( [ gamma_tsp_j > jc ] ) tends to the nel - brown result , @xmath93 for the relaxation rate of one rigid pair of spins with a barrier height twice that of one spin .",
    "note , however , that this convergence is very slow so that @xmath94 remains above the nel - brown result and only merges with the latter for @xmath95 . * relaxation rate for @xmath22 * : here we are faced with a semi - analytical case since the attempt frequencies @xmath96 ( for @xmath24 ) can not be obtained in a closed form and are thus computed numerically . on the other hand ,",
    "following the same procedure as for @xmath35 we obtain the relaxation rate for @xmath24 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the barrier height given by the energy ( [ enj < jc ] ) measured with respect to ( [ mfm ] ) or ( [ afm ] ) for @xmath99 respectively , and ( see eq .",

    "indeed , the product of the last two factors in the prefactor tend to @xmath102 , the attempt frequencies tend to @xmath103 , and the energy barriers @xmath104 .",
    "note that in the present regime of @xmath105 the large value of anisotropy has not changed the temperature dependence of the individual relaxation rates , i.e. , @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath108 appears in the prefactor each time there is a continuously degenerate class of saddle points @xcite , which is indeed the case for @xmath90 and @xmath105 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "however , anisotropy do affect the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate of the two - spin system , since for @xmath22 there are two saddle points bringing each a factor @xmath108 , see the first line in eq .",
    "( [ gamma_tsp ] ) .    * the case of @xmath76 * : when @xmath15 approaches @xmath111 either from above or from below , more hessian eigenvalues ( in addition to @xmath112 ) vanish , rendering the saddle point rather flat and thus leading to a divergent relaxation rate .",
    "indeed , for @xmath76 the relaxation rate ( [ gamma_tsp_j > jc ] ) diverges , which clearly shows that langer s approach which uses a quadratic approximation for the energy at the saddle point , e.g. , eq .",

    "the remedy is to push the energy expansion to the @xmath113order in the variable @xmath114 ( since @xmath115 as @xmath116 ) , i.e. , @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",

    "similarly , when @xmath15 approaches @xmath111 from below , for @xmath29 the eigenvalue @xmath122 vanishes at @xmath27 , upon which the saddle point ( [ sp21 ] ) ( @xmath29 ) merges with the state ( [ afm ] ) and thereby the partition functions @xmath123 and @xmath66 tend to infinity .",

    "we see that the relaxation rate of the two - spin system contains two unconnected branches corresponding to the two regimes , @xmath22 and @xmath35 , the bridging of which would require a more sophisticated approach .",
    "fig .  [ rate ] ( right ) also shows that as @xmath15 increases , but @xmath136 , the relaxation rate @xmath37 decreases because the switching of the first spin is hindered by the ( ferromagnetic ) exchange coupling . while @xmath38 is an increasing function of @xmath15 with a faster rate , since now the exchange coupling works in favor of the switching of the second spin .",
    "this is also illustrated by the evolution of the energy barrier height in fig .",
    "[ rate ] ( left ) .",
    "as @xmath15 approaches @xmath111 from below , the relaxation rate @xmath137 tends to @xmath39 because the respective saddle points merge at @xmath27 . whereas @xmath38 goes to zero since the corresponding saddle point merges with the antiferromagnetic state that is no longer accessible to the system . for @xmath138 ,",
    "as @xmath15 increases the minimum ( [ sfm ] ) , the metastable state ( [ mfm ] ) and the saddle point ( [ sp0 ] ) merge together , which means that the system is found in an `` energy groove '' along the direction @xmath139 because the eigenvalue @xmath140 corresponding to the mode @xmath141 becomes very large , and thus the escape rate decreases and eventually reaches the nel - brown value at large @xmath15 .",
