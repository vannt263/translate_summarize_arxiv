    "in the early universe during the time interval between 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2sec the universe passed through the temperature ( t ) range which included the critical t = t@xmath3 for the qcd chiral phase transition from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to the hadronic phase ( hp ) , t@xmath4 150 mev .",
    "this is the quark - hadron phase transition ( qht ) . in the present work",
    "we assume that this phase transition is first order , in which case bubbles of the hp could form , nucleate and collide until the our hp universe emerges with t at about 100 mev at 10@xmath2s .",
    "although at the present time lattice calculations can not determine the order of the transition@xcite , some lattice gauge calculations@xcite and numerical model calculations@xcite indicate that the transition is weakly first order , which would imply bubble formation during the qht .",
    "the crucial question is whether the phase transition leads to astrophysical observables .",
    "based on the results of an effective field model in which an internal qcd domain wall is produced within the hp bubble during the qht and results in a magnetic wall@xcite , a study of possible cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) correlations has been carried out@xcite .",
    "it was found that the large - scale magnetic wall could lead to cmbr polarization correlations that might be observable in the near future .",
    "this result depends on the existence of a domain - size thin gluonic wall with a lifetime long enough to produce the magnetic wall .",
    "the latter continues to exist and evolves until the last scattering time ( about 300,000 years ) , and can therefore lead to cmbr polarization and metric correlations .",
    "although there has been a great deal of work on bubble nucleation during the qht@xcite , a subject that is still incomplete , there has been very little published on the bubble collisions . for the electroweak phase transition ( ewt )",
    "bubble collisions were studied two decades ago@xcite using a higgs model and a semiclassical tunneling picture that was originally developed for nonperturbative qcd@xcite . in recent years",
    "an abelian higgs model@xcite has been used to study ewt bubble collisions@xcite and possible magnetic fields which are produced in such collisions .    in the present paper bubble collisions",
    "are studied for the qht using an instanton - inspired model of qcd .",
    "instantons can be used to represent the midrange nonperturbative qcd interactions , and recently have been used to study high - energy collisions of quark / gluon systems@xcite .",
    "also , for the qht an instanton model for the bubble wall between the qgp and hp is consistent with the surface tension found in lattice gauge calculations@xcite .",
    "however , the bubble nucleation and collisions have not been calculated in such a picture .",
    "we do not attempt the study of nucleation in this work , but center on investigation of the possible production of an interior gluonic wall , which could possibly lead to the cmbr correlations found in ref.@xcite    the equations of motion for the qcd pure - gluonic lagrangian , i.e. , the equations of motion for the su(3 ) color field without quarks , are given in sec .",
    "ii , with a brief discussion of the instanton model .",
    "the equations of motion for the instanton - motivated su(2 ) model of qcd used in the present work , which we call su(2 ) yang - mills fields to distinguish the model from su(3 ) qcd , are given in sec iii .",
    "the instanton - type form is in 4-dimensional euclidean space , which we continue to ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space for the investigation of bubble collisions ; and we choose a convenient metric , which we discuss in detail .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor in minkowski space is also derived . in sec .",
    "iv we study ( 1 + 1)-dimensional collisions in minkowski space and find promising gluonic structure arising in the interior . this could be the basis for investigating large - scale structure that could lead to cmbr correlations or large - scale galaxy effects .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in sec .",
    "in this section we consider the purely gluonic part of the qcd lagrangian , derive the field equations of motion , and discuss the relation to the instanton model .",
    "since in the present work we do not solve these equations , but use the su(2 ) instanton - motivated version described in the next section , we only give a brief discussion here .",

    "we start with the su(2 ) gauge field as in the instanton model , and model the color field with the color / dirac structure of the instanton solutions@xcite , but keep a more general space - time structure .",

    "we find it convenient to use a metric @xmath13 in euclidean space , so that our metric in minkowski space is not the standard one .",
    "of course this does not alter our results , as we discuss in the next section .",
