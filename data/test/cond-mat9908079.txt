    "the time evolution of systems of interacting species modeling natural ecosystems has attracted wide attention since its first studies by lotka @xcite and volterra @xcite .",
    "various models have been introduced in order to consider different aspects of natural life , including motion , birth and death processes , evolution and extinction @xcite . physical motivation for studying such models",
    "is that they exhibit interesting features such as chaos and critical phenomena .",
    "a much studied category of such models is that of two interacting species , the so called predator - prey systems @xcite .",
    "however , most of the existing models neglect the effect of time delays on the dynamics of the models . by time - delayed systems we mean such systems that their dynamics is not defined only by knowing their present state , but some information about previous states is required .",
    "time delays are present in many different physical or biological systems , and are particularly able to account for many features of ecological phenomena @xcite , although they have not been studied extensively .    in this paper we introduce a new model of the predator - prey problem with history - dependent dynamics . in our model ,",
    "herbivors and edible plants are the predators and the prey , respectively .",
    "the predators stray randomly in a plant - full environment , eating them when they find any , but the eaten plant will regrow after a definite elapsed time .",
    "the predators reproduce with a constant rate and die , if they have not eaten anything in a specified length of time . in our model ,",
    "time delays enter the temporal evolution equations through the terms representing plants growth and predators death .",
    "somewhat similar models without such time delays were published before @xcite .",
    "the set of time - delayed equations leads to a rich collection of dynamical behaviors including chaos .",
    "as we will show , however , the emerging space correlation of the densities can eliminate the chaotic behavior .",
    "we have studied this model by discrete - time , lattice - based computer simulations , as well as by a mean - field approximation solution . in what follows",
    "we describe our model and then present and discuss the results .",
    "the ecosystem consists of a(n infinite ) square lattice each site of which if not empty , is occupied by either predators or a plant .",
    "the predators move randomly to one of the nearest neighbors ( two - dimensional free random walk ) and do not interact with each other , therefore multiple occupancy of the site is allowed .",
    "if a predator enters a site occupied by a plant , it will eat it .",
    "however after @xmath2 time steps another plant grows at that site .    to every predator an _ energy _ is assigned , indicating the number of steps that it can go without eating anything . as a result , the energy is lowered by one at every time step . eating",
    "a plant raises the energy to the maximum value @xmath3 , so that a predator that has not eaten anything in @xmath3 steps will die . at every time",
    "step each predator reproduces with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the offspring is positioned at the same site and half of the parent s energy is transferred to it .",
    "these rules are applied in the following order .",
    "the predators are first moved in a random sequence .",
    "they eat every plant that they can , after which they reproduce with some probability and finally plant growth occurs . in the case of more than one predator",
    "entering a plant site , the early comer eats the plant .",
    "the rules governing the motion of the predators are those that are characteristics of branching diffusion processes , for which the space and time average quantities as well as spatial correlations have been investigated @xcite .",
    "what we examine in the following sections is the time evolution of the mean spatial densities of predators and plants .",
    "we first present the results obtained from simulating the model .",
    "simulations are made on a @xmath5 square lattice with @xmath6 and with periodic boundary conditions . as initial conditions , predators and plants",
    "are distributed randomly and the value of @xmath3 is assigned to the energy of every predator .",
    "the sites that are initially plant - free must be filled with plants in the first @xmath2 steps , so a random integer @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is assigned to every such site , and a plant occupies that site at the @xmath9 s time step .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote predator and plant respective local densities and @xmath12 and @xmath13 be their respective spatial mean values , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 stands for spatial averaging ) .",
    "@xmath17 is an integer number including @xmath18 , while @xmath11 is either @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are assumed to be equal to the probability of predators and plants occupying a lattice site ( assuming that @xmath20 does not become larger than one ) .",
    "as expected , time evolution of the two species can lead to a stationary state ( fig .",
    "1 ) in which both @xmath21 and @xmath20 fluctuate about their ( time independent ) mean values , and the fluctuations are predominantly out of phase . therefore by averaging @xmath13 and @xmath12 over many realizations of the system we find a fixed point in the @xmath22 phase space ( fig .",
    "2 ) ( where @xmath23 represents the expectation value found by averaging over different realizations ) .",
    "trivially , @xmath24 is also a fixed point ( _ extinction _ state ) . in a wide range of parameters",
    "this is unstable , and there exists the just described active oscillatory state with a @xmath25 stable fixed point .",
    "but in a large region in the parameter space of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , the point @xmath26 is stable and there is no non - extinction stationary state .",
    "this is the case for sufficiently large @xmath2 ( low growth rate for the plants ) , low @xmath3 ( low energy content of a plant ) or low @xmath4 ( low predator birth rate ) .",
    "even an unstable fixed point , @xmath27 can be reached ( in transient region ) by specific initial conditions that are large @xmath28 or large @xmath29 . in the latter case ,",
    "the initially high density of plants increases @xmath20 and decreases @xmath21 very much and consequently all the predators die of starvation . in the following we consider the non - trivial ( non - extinction ) stationary state .",
    "although the predators ( plants ) have no interaction with each other , the spatial distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not uniform in the stationary state .",
    "this is due to the rules of the game that are random motion of predators and the laws of birth and death @xcite . as a typical pattern , fig .",
    "3 shows the emergence of clusters of predators and plants for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , when the system is in its stationary state .",
    "formation of the clusters is characterized quantitatively by the predator or plant autocorrelation functions defined by @xmath36 @xmath37 these clusters form separately , since if there is a plant at a site no predators can be at the same site .",
    "this is shown by the predator - plant correlation function : @xmath38 fig .",
    "4 shows @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 as functions of @xmath42 along the lattice axis , for the same parameter set as in fig.3 .",
    "they all vanish as @xmath42 increases , but while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are positive functions for small @xmath42 , representing formation of the clusters , @xmath45 is negative since the probability that a plant occupies a site decreases if there is a predator in the neighborhood .",
    "diffusion of the predators increases the fluctuations in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "an exponential function best fits to @xmath43 with correlation length increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the correlation of the predators and plants within a mean - field approximation .",
    "if the probabilities that a site is occupied by a predator or a plant were independent , the density of the eaten plants at every time step would be given by @xmath46 i.e. @xmath47 is the probability of that a site is simultaneously occupied by both a predator and a plant . to take into account the just described correlations",
    ", we modify this expression , by writing as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and also can be thought of as a rate .",
    "stronger correlations imply larger clusters which lowers the value of @xmath50 .",
    "introduction of @xmath51 rate , can also be justified in this way : since predators move randomly , a predator lowers its food - eating chance by repeatedly coming back to the sites which had previously been occupied by itself and it had eaten the plants in them .",
    "we show that @xmath50 is an important parameter that controls the ability of the system to transit into a chaotic phase .    to calculate @xmath52 by simulation , we enumerate the total number of the eaten plants at time @xmath53 and divide it by @xmath54 .",
    "figure 5 represents as a function of time , the value of @xmath55 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 which indicates that it becomes essentially a constant at about @xmath56 in the stationary state .",
    "in fact @xmath55 varies slightly as @xmath57 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 change .",
    "the value of @xmath50 can also be read from the correlation function ( fig 4c ) . since the probability that a plant is eaten is @xmath58 of probability that a predator and a plant are nearest neighbors , and this probability is equal to the probability of finding a predator and a plant within a unit distance * i *",
    ", we have @xmath59 then @xmath60    > from fig .",
    "4(c ) we find that @xmath61 and @xmath62 in complete agreement with the independently calculated value of @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "the time evolution equations will then be @xmath63 \\\\",
    "p(t+1)&=&p(t)\\left\\ { ( 1+b)-\\prod_{t^{\\prime } = 0}^{l-1}[1-rn(t - t^{\\prime } ) ] \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 8) is @xmath47 and the first is @xmath64 , the density of the plants eaten at time @xmath65 which will grow again after @xmath2 steps at time @xmath66 . the second term on the right - hand side of eq.(9 ) is the probability of a predator not eating anything in each of the past @xmath3 steps . at any time",
    ", a predator does not eat a plant with a probability    @xmath67    i.e. the ratio of density of those predators who do not eat to the total predators density .",
    "in order to find the possible solutions of this set of equations , we numerically compute @xmath68 and @xmath69 , knowing the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 at the earlier times . by repeatedly doing this",
    ", we can find all the possible trajectories in the @xmath70 phase space .",
    "however , because of the existence of time delays , it is not sufficient to know only @xmath20 and @xmath21 at time @xmath18 in order to initiate these equations . therefore , to overcome this difficulty we rewrite these equations as    @xmath71    we drop the @xmath72 term from eq .",
    "( 8) for @xmath73 , and add the term @xmath74 to take into account growing of the plants in the initially plant - free sites .",
    "also , we eliminate the second term in eq .",
    "( 9 ) for @xmath75 because of the initially full energy of all the predators .    as in the case of the simulations",
    ", @xmath26 is a trivial fixed point , which is unstable only for sufficiently low @xmath3 , low @xmath4 or high @xmath2 and long - time behavior of the solutions does not depend on the values of @xmath29 and @xmath28 . here",
    ", we do not consider that range of the parameters for which extinction occurs . in order to find a fixed point ( fig .",
    "6 ) we assume that @xmath21 and @xmath20 are constant for a long time , that is @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to    @xmath79\\ ] ]    ( which is independent of @xmath2 ) but no explicit expression for @xmath80 .",
    "however , interestingly , as we have checked numerically , there also exists a unique @xmath81 and the fixed point ( specially its @xmath20-coordinate ) is uniquely determined by the parameters and independent of initial conditions .    although @xmath50 is obtained definitely from simulation , we assume it to be variable .",
    "it is easily seen that the dynamics of the equations depends critically on the value of @xmath50 .",
    "we temporarily assume @xmath82 which means neglecting the correlations and clustering .    for every @xmath3 and @xmath4 the fixed point is stable for low @xmath2 .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , the fixed point eventually loses its stability through a hopf bifurcation and turns to a limit cycle ( fig .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased further , more bifurcations occur which lead to the chaotic phase ( fig .",
    "figure 9 represents the bifurcation diagram , which is the poincare maps for constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 and varying @xmath2 , obtained from the intersection of trajectories in the phase space with the vertical line @xmath83 .",
    "10 is the same graph for the same set of parameters except that @xmath84 ( see below ) , in which the chaotic regime has been eliminated .",
    "we found that the time - evolution equations with a realistic value of @xmath85 which is obtained from the simulation , do not exhibit a chaotic behavior .",
    "this is similar to what occurs in the simulation which always there exists a stationary state .",
    "however , setting @xmath82 artificially , can produce a chaotic behavior .",
    "this has an interesting interpretation : formation of the clusters and emergence of correlations removes the chaotic regime .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "11 offers a comparison between the mean - field results and those of the computer simulations . here ,",
    "the fixed points in @xmath86 phase space derived from simulation and the time - average of @xmath70 obtained from the mean - field equations are shown with @xmath87 , @xmath33 , and varying @xmath2 from 65 to 150 .",
    "@xmath50 is chosen so that the two curves best coincide and that occurs if @xmath88 .",
    "we have introduced and studied a model for the predator - prey problem with time delay in which the prey are edible plants and the predators are herbivores .",
    "the model is defined algorithmically through a series of rules that are i ) random - walk motion of the predators ; ii ) growth of the eaten plants after a time delay , and iii ) death of those predators not having eaten anything in a specified length of time . both rules",
    "ii and iii generate history dependence in the mean - field equations .",
    "simulation of the model on a lattice yields stationary states with fixed points in the phase space of @xmath89 as well as a trivial @xmath27 fixed point .    in such stationary states , the predators and the prey",
    "are distributed in separately - formed clusters and hence producing non - zero autocorrelation as well as correlation functions .",
    "such correlations are taken into account in the mean - field equations by introduction of a rate @xmath51 in the expression of the eaten plants density .",
    "these equations have chaotic solutions for @xmath50 nearly 1 , but there is no chaos if @xmath50 is lowered to its true value obtained from the simulation .",
