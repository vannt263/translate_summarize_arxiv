    "in recent years , there has been a growing interest in the topic of consensus decision making in several fields including animal behaviour @xcite , social sciences @xcite and control theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the paradigm of animal groups but we would like to stress already at this point that there is a considerable analogy between the decision - making processes in very different systems and we expect that our simple model should be applicable to a wider range of systems . our object of study is the phenomenon during which the animals moving in groups , seemingly make unanimous decisions on the choice and time of performing activities even in the absence of global leaders . it is expected that because of the heterogeneity in the attributes like the age , sex and social status of the animals in a group or the differences in their perception of external stimuli there will be differences in the motivations of the members at the time of making choices . however , in spite of the differences , synchronization is seen to take place .",
    "examples include takeoff of swarm of honeybees from nest sites @xcite , activity synchronization in sheep @xcite , collective movement in monkeys @xcite , group departures of domestic geese @xcite and departure of ants from a feeding site @xcite .",
    "the study of collective opinion formation in physics has mainly focused on human societies @xcite .",
    "parallels have been drawn between phase transitions in magnets and the opinion dynamics in populations .",
    "alternatively , the subject of collective motion of animal groups has been extensively modelled @xcite . here",
    "point - like particles , representing animals , move with constant speed , each tending to align with its immediate neighbours , for low noise levels , giving rise to a globally ordered state replicating the motion of flocks where all animals move in the same direction .    in this report",
    "we model the process of landing of bird flocks performing foraging flights as a typical example of collective decision making .",
    "we view this phenomena as a shift of the average opinion of the flock from that of continuing horizontal flight about some preferred altitude to that of descent towards the surface below .",
    "we model the fact that birds land almost synchronously even in the presence of heterogeneity in motivations , along the lines of the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite .",
    "our approach is similar to that used in @xcite where the authors analyze ( among other cases ) the manner in which people in concert halls , initially joining the applause , stop clapping almost at the same time . in a very recent model @xcite for collective landing ,",
    "birds are assumed to move under the action of different _ social _ forces .",
    "in addition , the internal state of each bird is characterized by a continuous variable called _ landing intent _ such that the internal state of each bird is directly coupled to the internal state of its neighbours .",
    "in contrast we allow motivation of individual birds to be influenced by only the observable variables of their neighbours , like position and velocity .",
    "in addition as a part of the model we introduce a method which enables us to work in open boundary conditions where the birds in flight move cohesively and do not spread out in the horizontal plane even in the presence of perturbations . with this model",
    "we investigate the level of synchronicity in collective landing across time and space and explore the nature of fluctuations close to the point in time when landing occurs .",
    "below we describe the two aspects of the model , _ viz . _ collective decision making and collective motion in detail .",
    "the birds in our model are represented by particles characterized by the dynamical variables of position @xmath0 and velocity @xmath1 in three dimensional space .",
    "the only _ natural _ boundary that we allow in the system is the @xmath2 plane which we consider to be the landing surface .",
    "the @xmath3-coordinate of a flying bird gives its height above the ground .",
    "we assign to each particle @xmath4 a variable @xmath5 such that we refer to a bird in the flying state as active ( @xmath6 ) and a bird in the landed state as inactive ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this variable is updated at discrete times @xmath8 according to the condition : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time increment . once a bird @xmath4",
    "has landed we keep its position unchanged till the end of the simulation .",
    "also , from here on we use the words `` bird '' and `` particle '' synonymously .",
    "first we focus on the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 governing the cruising motion of the birds parallel to the landing surface .",
    "this motion is assumed to be essentially decoupled from the motion in the vertical direction and is modelled in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "a particle @xmath4 is assumed to move , with some uncertainty , in the average direction of motion of all neighboring particles @xmath13 whose separation @xmath14 from @xmath4 is less than a interaction radius @xmath15 . from now on we refer to the set of particles in this neighbourhood as @xmath16 with respect to a particle @xmath4 such that , the inactive particles and the particle @xmath4 are included as well .",
    "the expression for updating velocity at a time @xmath8 is given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath19 is the rotation matrix in two dimensions representing a random perturbation by an angle @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the unit vector @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath20 is chosen with a uniform probability from the interval @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the noise .",
    "we describe the force - like term @xmath25 below .",
    "we follow the standard version @xcite of the original spp model @xcite for the updating of positions : @xmath26    we mention here that it is a well - known problem with existing models of collective motion to maintain the cohesiveness of a moving flock in the presence of a finite amount of noise @xmath24 and with finite ranged ( as @xmath15 ) interaction between the members .",
    "a flock tends to break up into smaller sub - flocks which eventually move in independent directions .",
    "a periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is used to prevent the flock from spreading out perpendicular to the direction of motion . however , in the problem of landing we find that the imposition of a pbc would be unrealistic in the sense that there will be a possibility of a particle that has become inactive and hence ceased to move , to continually exchange information with the rest of the moving flock .",
    "therefore , we introduce a new kind of `` comoving boundary '' condition where we imagine the motion of the particles on the @xmath27-plane to be governed by a circular bounding region with radius @xmath28 and the centre lying on the centre of mass ( _ com _ ) of all active particles ( mass of each assumed to be unity ) .",
    "this boundary therefore translates with the flock as the _ com _ is put into motion due to collective motion of the particles .",
    "when a particle which is inside the region tries to leave it , the particle is subjected to an attraction proportional to the distance from the boundary .",
    "the direction of this attraction is along the resultant of the direction towards the location of the _ com _ and the direction of motion of the _ com _ itself . for a particle located at @xmath29 at an instant of time , the attraction @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31\\mathbf{c}\\big(\\mathbf{x^{\\shortparallel}}\\big )          & \\mbox { if $ |\\mathbf{x}^{\\shortparallel}-\\mathbf{\\overline{x}}^{\\shortparallel}| > r_\\mathrm{b}$ } \\\\        0 & \\mbox { otherwise , }      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the strength of the attraction , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the position and the velocity of the _ com _ , respectively , parallel to the @xmath27-plane at that instant and @xmath36 is a parameter . the _ com _ and its velocity",
    "are calculated with respect to the active particles . in the figure [ field ] we plot",
    "@xmath25 when the motion of the _ com _ is in a direction parallel to the y - axis .",
    "similarly , we assume that the boundary adjusts itself to keep average separation between active particles constant .",
    "thus , in general @xmath28 is a function of time , given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fraction of the active particles at time @xmath8 and @xmath39 is the number of particles , initially active , per unit area of the @xmath27-plane .     on the @xmath27-plane , defined through ( [ bound-1 ] ) for the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the direction of motion of the _ com _ is assumed to be along the y - axis , indicated by the arrow at the centre of the circle .",
    "the length of a vector is directly proportional to the distance from the boundary .",
    ", width=340 ]    now we explain how the collective decision making process takes place in the flock and how it is related to the cohesion and eventual landing along the vertical direction .",
    "we characterize the decision of an individual bird as a binary choice problem @xcite . to each bird",
    "@xmath4 we assign an internal state variable @xmath41 such that when @xmath42 the bird continues to cruise above ground and when @xmath43 the bird decides to land . for the cruising state",
    "we assume that a bird likes to fly about an altitude @xmath44 on average without deviating too far above or below .",
    "however , we expect the elevation of a bird to fluctuate with time pertaining to factors like the noise in the medium and collision avoidance .",
    "thus when @xmath42 we consider the vertical motion of the particle to be essentially a random walk bounded by imaginary walls at @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the thickness of the flock . in case the bird decides to land the vertical motion is directed towards the landing surface at @xmath2 .",
    "formally we define , @xmath48 & \\textrm{if $ s_i(t)=1 $ and $ |\\delta(t-\\delta t)|>\\delta z_0/2 $ } \\\\",
    "-v &   \\textrm{if $ s_i(t)=-1 $ , } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath49 takes values @xmath50 with equal probability and @xmath51 , is the amount of deviation from the height @xmath44 at time @xmath52 .    to model the motivational differences in birds we assign to each bird @xmath4 , an inherent switching time @xmath53 @xcite such that if the bird begins an isolated flight at time @xmath54 , it would decide to land at time @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath53 for the bird @xmath4 will in general depend on its energy reserves @xcite and thus in general will be different for different birds .",
    "we choose @xmath53 s from a gaussian distribution with a given standard deviation @xmath56 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 allows us to control the level of heterogeneity in a flock .",
    "although we assign _ a priori _ values of @xmath53 to birds , due to the randomness in the choice of these switching times , they can be thought to be additionally include the effect of the environment such as quality of foraging patches over which the flocks fly .    for a particle in the flock",
    ", it will have a finite number of particles in its neighbourhood and therefore will be influenced by their actions while taking a decision .",
    "hence the internal state of a particle will be a function of two competing factors , ( i ) its inherent switching time and ( ii ) the internal state of the neighbours , which we assume to be reflected by the nature of their motion . in an approach similar to that of the rfim at zero temperature @xcite we write down : @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the propensity of a particle to follow the decision of its neighbours and @xmath59 is the _ local mean field _ through which the bird @xmath4 senses the average decision in its neighbourhood @xmath16 .",
    "we expect that the inclination of a bird @xmath4 to land will be enhanced by a resultant motion of birds in @xmath16 towards the landing surface , and also by the number of birds that have already landed .",
    "we define @xmath59 at a time @xmath8 as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the average value of @xmath3-component of velocity of active particles and fraction of active particles , respectively , in the neighbourhood @xmath16 at time @xmath8 . at times",
    "@xmath63 , the birds on average have no inclination to land and therefore we expect them to maintain a height around @xmath64 without any resultant vertical motion towards the landing surface .",
    "in this regime we expect for any particle @xmath4 , @xmath65 and also , @xmath66 , implying that @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hand a resultant vertical motion in negative @xmath3-direction would imply @xmath68 .",
    "thus in a regime when majority move towards the landing surface at @xmath2 and eventually reach inactive states , we expect @xmath69 .",
    "we now move on to characterize the resulting collective landing as a function of different states of collective motion .",
    "_ we would like to emphasize at this point that although the detailed description of our model involves specifying nine expressions , the essential concept and the ingredients of the model are rather simple ( spp + rfim ) and the number of independent parameters is low ( @xmath24 , @xmath15 , @xmath70 , @xmath58)_.",
    "we note that in our model , the shape of a coherently moving flock , far from the landing regime , is roughly cylindrical with a radius of cross section @xmath71 and thickness @xmath47 .",
    "we argue that from the point of view of our model for large flocks @xmath47 will have in general weak or no dependence on the number of birds .",
    "we choose the thickness of the flock @xmath47 as the unit to measure distances ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we choose the projected density @xmath73 , the interaction radius @xmath74 and the preferred altitude of flying @xmath75 . in our simulations",
    "we take @xmath76 , unless mentioned otherwise , the order of which is typical for moderately large flocks @xcite .",
    "also the ratio @xmath77 would be typical in these flocks which have thickness of order @xmath78 m and fly at altitudes of around @xmath79 m. at the time @xmath54 in ( [ rfim ] ) we expect the flock to be already in the steady state of collective motion .",
    "so before we switch on time as in ( [ rfim ] ) we evolve a flock to its steady state of motion according to equations ( [ eom - xy ] ) , ( [ eq_snm_pos ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) where each particle @xmath4 has @xmath42 .",
    "it is known @xcite that the nature of the collective motion depends on the amplitude of the noise .",
    "we find that for sufficiently low values of @xmath24 , all the particles align their directions and the flock as a whole translates in some spontaneously chosen direction parallel to the @xmath27-plane . as the value of @xmath24",
    "is increased , the tendency of alignment is gradually lost leading to weak or no translation .",
    "however , the actual nature of this transition is not known precisely enough and its detailed investigation is outside of the scope of the present paper .",
    "we make an observation that there are two independent time scales in the problem - the time scale of motion and the time scale over which the inherent switching times are distributed .",
    "the former is given by @xmath80 which is the time required to move one unit of length ( or half interaction radius @xmath81 ) .",
    "in presence of finite amount of noise @xmath24 , this time scale would also govern the mixing between particles .",
    "the width of the distribution of @xmath53 s ( @xmath82 ) gives a measure of the time over which the energy reserves of the majority in the flock are exhausted .",
    "therefore , when @xmath83 , there is hardly any motion during the collective decision making .",
    "when @xmath84 the flock actually translates ( at low values of @xmath24 ) over a long distance during the process .",
    "we call the ratio of these two time scales as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , and we investigate the nature of landing at its different values .",
    "we set the time scale for choosing values of @xmath18 and @xmath56 as the time increment @xmath87 .",
    "the value of magnitude of velocity @xmath18 is kept around and below @xmath88 so that change in the set of neighbours @xmath16 of any bird @xmath4 is gradual .",
    "we choose the value of the parameters for the comoving boundary described by equations ( [ bound-1 ] ) and ( [ bound-2 ] ) to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also observe that parameter @xmath36 controls the degree of asymmetry of the vector field @xmath91 ( [ bound-2 ] ) outside the comoving boundary . for @xmath92",
    "the system enters into a rotating phase @xcite , and for @xmath93 the flock has a tendency to accumulate at the boundary .      the role played by the coupling @xmath58 in ( [ rfim ] )",
    "is well known @xcite and has also been the matter of investigation . however ,",
    "in our model we fix @xmath58 to an optimal value for which we find the desired behaviour , as explained below . in the figure [ trans - land](a )",
    "we compare the process of landing across time for different values of the coupling . for a flock with inherent switching times @xmath94 chosen with a fixed @xmath56",
    "we monitor the fraction of active particles @xmath95 with time @xmath8 for different values of @xmath58 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath96 the particles become inactive independent of each other at their own switching times as seen from the curve @xmath97 which falls smoothly with time . on choosing @xmath98",
    "the behaviour is quite opposite .",
    "a very sharp fall occurs in the curve @xmath99 implying that there is indeed a collective decision making taking place when a large number of particles reach inactive states within a short period of time .",
    "however , comparing the two curves @xmath97 and @xmath99 it appears that in the latter case , the collective landing occurs at point in time which is much larger than ( by an amount of order @xmath56 ) than the switching times of most of the birds .",
    "we find that a much lower value of @xmath100 is relevant biologically .",
    "the curve @xmath101 sharply falls indicating collective behaviour and the fall occurs near at a time when about half of the birds have just crossed their inherent switching times .    in the figure [ trans - land](a )",
    "we also plot @xmath102 which is the fraction of birds which have a momentary intention to land at time @xmath8 _",
    "i.e. _ , the fraction of particles with @xmath43 . unlike @xmath101 , the quantity @xmath102 is seen to fluctuate before becoming equal to the maximum value unity .",
    "this shows that before finally deciding to land , birds may intermittently change their decision .",
    "this is caused by the fluctuations in the vertical motion ( [ spin ] ) of neighbours as well as the changing neighbourhood due to finite value of @xmath24 .",
    "however , these fluctuations become only important near the landing regime .",
    "we explore an aspect of these fluctuations later . in the figure [ trans - land](b )",
    "we plot the velocity field of a typical flock when the majority has decided to land .",
    "denotes the fraction of birds not landed yet as the time @xmath8 progresses .",

    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath113 averaged over different realizations of @xmath114 s , provides a measure of the extent to which the landing of the flock is coherent in time such that @xmath115 implies the complete absence of collective decision making . in the figure [ t2080-r](a )",
    "we plot @xmath113 versus @xmath24 for different values of @xmath85 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the quantity @xmath109 provides an alternate normalization of @xmath70 with respect to the other independent time scale @xmath108(@xmath119 ) .",
    "we find that for @xmath85 close to unity , @xmath120 asserting that the landing is coherent and the separation between landing times is due to the width @xmath47 . for larger values of @xmath85",
    "the value of @xmath113 also becomes large signifying gradual loss of coherence .",
    "we also observe that in general @xmath113 has a maximum for intermediate values of the noise .",
    "we find that if we choose to ignore the particles which become inactive either too early or too late , then the level of temporal coherence appears better . for a particular landing",
    "we measure the times @xmath121 and @xmath122 at which @xmath111 and @xmath123 of the particles , respectively , in the flock has just become inactive .",

    "we investigate the degree of collectiveness as a function of the distance over which a flock lands in figure [ t2080-r](b ) .",
    "we calculate the following quantity : @xmath129 this quantifies the spread of the flock across the landing surface .",
    "we normalize the value of this spread ( @xmath130 ) when all particles become inactive by the corresponding value ( @xmath131 ) calculated with the positions of the active particles at time @xmath54 . in the figure [ t2080-r](b )",

    "for very low values of @xmath24 the flock translates over large distances . due to this translation ,",
    "the particles reaching inactive states early are unable to influence the decision of the active particles in the flock as the _ com _ moves away from these particles . in this case",

    "is weak or no translation of the _ com_. however , the scale of the difference in inherent switching times _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 being very slow as compared to the scale of motion , it provides the scope for a particle with a low value of @xmath53 to diffuse to the boundary . as a result , temporarily the influence of the neighbourhood is weakened .",
    "this allows the particle to switch its state and become inactive .",
    "initially , the excursions of the particles to the comoving boundary becomes the reason behind independent landings .",
    "the shrinking of the boundary ( [ rb ] ) effectively screens ( depending upon the interaction radius @xmath15 ) the active particles from the inactive particles . for moderate values of @xmath24 the path of the _ com _ becomes tortuous .",

    "the equation ( [ lambda - scale ] ) suggests that for a fixed value of @xmath85 , with the increase in the system size there is increase in temporal coherence .",
    "we also plot the corresponding values of the ratio @xmath113 in the inset ( b ) .",
    "the plot shows how this ratio approaches the maximum value unity with the increase in the value of @xmath85 .",
    "the reason for the rise in @xmath113 for very low values of @xmath85 is already stated with respect to the figure [ t2080-r](a ) . in all the above investigations we have assumed that the interaction radius controlling the average number of neighbours of any particle is @xmath74 .",
    "we now address the issue of having larger ( or smaller ) interaction radii . in the figure [ t - r](b )",
    "we plot the variation of @xmath109 with the value of @xmath15 for different values of @xmath85 with value of noise set at @xmath139 .",
    "we find significant decrease in the spread @xmath109 for large values of @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that global information can lead to a more coherent decision making process .     of the maximum depth @xmath160 of excursions below the flock by birds , before returning to the flock as a result of temporarily reverting from the decision to land .",
    "the parameter sets indicated by symbols are @xmath161 , @xmath162 ( circles ) and @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( squares ) . the solid line has a slope @xmath163 and is a guide to the eye .",

    "the parameter sets indicated by symbols are same as in the case of ( a ) .",
    "the measured slopes of the power - law fits to the curves are around @xmath166 . in both (",
    "a ) and ( b ) the value of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and the magnitude of the velocity @xmath18 controls the lower cut - off of the power - law decays.,width=529 ]",
    "lastly , we focus on the nature of fluctuations during the landing process . as a result of the decision reversals in birds under the influence from the neighbourhood ( as reflected by @xmath102 in the figure [ trans - land](a ) )",
    "we find that birds originally moving towards the landing surface sometimes return back to the cruising altitude .",
    "we characterize these fluctuations by the maximum depth @xmath160 to which a bird makes an excursion before returning to an altitude greater than @xmath169 . in the figure [ aval - dcm](a )",
    "we plot the probability density @xmath170 .",
    "we find that the distribution of @xmath160 is a power - law decay bounded by a minimum and maximum governed by the magnitude of velocity @xmath18 and the maximum possible depth @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "we also study the jumps that occur in position of the _ com _",
    "( on the @xmath27 plane ) of flying birds once the landing process starts .",
    "as is seen from the figure [ com - psi](a ) the trajectory of the _ com _ becomes irregular near the end .",
    "the _ com _ actually jumps from a cluster which ceases to move to a cluster which continues moving .",
    "we construct the probability density @xmath164 for the separation @xmath165 between the centres of mass at two consecutive time steps .",
    "we find that @xmath164 has a fat tail during the landing process . in the figure [ aval - dcm](b )",
    "we plot the tail of @xmath164 after binning .",
    "the plots reveals power law decays with close by exponents .",
    "the power law has a cut - off which governed by @xmath138 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the interplay between the dynamics of collective motion and collective decision making . in particular",
    "we have presented a model for landing of bird flocks .",
    "we have identified the relevant scales in such a problem and we have worked in the coupling regime which is expected to be biologically relevant .",
    "it appears that higher values of the coupling delays the process of the global opinion shift .",
    "we have characterized the degree of the resulting collective behaviour by different measures .",
    "we found that  as a function of the few parameters of our model  the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual ( inherent ) landing intentions . among the several interesting features of the model we proposed",
    ", we showed that if the flock is subject to larger fluctuations , the spatial spreading of the fully landed flock becomes smaller due to a better mixing of the information about the momentary landing intentions of the birds .",
    "we also find that there is a characteristic value of heterogeneity which scales with the size of the flock .",
    "below this value of heterogeneity , flocks remain spatially coherent in the process of landing and above this value , the coherence is lost .",
    "in addition we have formulated a boundary condition which is pertinent to models of flocking .",
    "we believe that the approach we proposed is also relevant for many other systems where abrupt behavioural changes are observed .",
    "possible applications include various kinds of animal or even robotic groups in which an almost instantaneous global switching to a new desired state takes place .",
