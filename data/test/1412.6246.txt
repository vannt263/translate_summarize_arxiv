    "entanglement is emerging as an important characteristic of many - particle systems . while not yet a directly accessible quantity experimentally , entanglement entropy ( ee ) and spectrum have been studied theoretically and numerically in many different models .",
    "in general they are _ not _ simply related to correlation functions measured in linear response , and thus provide alternative probes of the system that are particularly useful in determining the nature of phases and phase transitions.@xcite    among the many systems whose entanglement properties have been studied , the best understood are perhaps one - dimensional ( 1d ) conformally - invariant systems . in this case",
    "it is not only understood that bipartite ee grows logarithmically with subsystem size with a coefficient depending on the central charge only,@xcite but also much is known about how a single impurity affects ee.@xcite the effect of the impurity depends sensitively on whether the perturbation it induces is relevant or not in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense .",
    "when it is relevant , it effectively cuts the chain into two decoupled pieces in the scaling limit , and typically produces a finite correction to entanglement entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "when it is irrelevant , its effect goes to zero in a power - law fashion in the scaling limit.@xcite what has been left out in previous studies is the case when the impurity is _",
    "exactly marginal_. this is the case when a single potential scatterer is embedded in a 1d free fermi gas,@xcite which is the subject of the present work .",
    "the non - interacting nature of the system allows for detailed numerical studies in sufficiently large systems sizes that yields results in the scaling regime .",
    "our main findings are the following .",
    "a single impurity in a 1d free fermion lattice induces two subleading contributions to ee , both of which scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the subsystem size .",
    "one of these contributions oscillates with the fermi wave vector , while the other is non - oscillatory .",
    "the origin of both terms are identified by considering certain limiting cases , where analytic treatment is available .",
    "we note that a closely related recent work@xcite did not find any corrections to ee for such impurities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ analytic ]",
    "we show by analytic calculation that an inversion symmetric potential adds to the continuum free fermi gas ee a term inversely proportional to the subsystem size .",
    "we verify this numerically in the succeeding sections for a discrete lattice system . in section [ method ]",
    "we introduce the one dimensional single impurity hamiltonian model and the numerical method of calculating the ee . in section [ numeric ] , detailed numerical calculations are presented ; we first verify numerically asymptotic and subleading behavior of the free fermion ee up to order of @xmath2 .",
    "then , we show that the single impurity introduces a term on the order of @xmath0 to the ee . in the rest of this section , behavior of the subleading term",
    "is examined numerically in the regime of large impurity strength , small impurity strength , and disorder on the order @xmath3 .",
    "some concluding remarks are offered in section [ con ] .",
    "let us consider a 1d free fermi gas with states @xmath4 fully occupied , and the entanglement between a subsystem a defined by @xmath5 with the rest of the infinite line ( called b ) .",
    "all entanglement - related properties are encoded in the two overlap matrices : @xmath6 where we used the fact that there is no overlap between even and odd functions .",
    "equivalently , but perhaps done less often , we can work with the analog of the above in subsystem b @xmath7 now introduce a inversion symmetric impurity potential @xmath8 with range @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "there are two special features of such potential that are very useful for later considerations : ( i ) energy eigenstates will remain parity eigenstates , such that there is no mixing between even and odd parity states .",
    "( ii ) as long as @xmath11 , the only effect on the wavefunctions in subsystem b is a phase shift : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to work with the b matrices as they only involve the phase shifts but not the complicated wavefunction in the region @xmath14 where it is not a plane wave .",
    "furthermore , in the low - energy limit @xmath15 , the @xmath16-dependence of the phase shifts can be parameterized by scattering lengths : @xmath17 in the asymptotic limit where this behavior becomes exact , we find @xmath18 namely , the entanglement properties of the even sector is identical to those of the original impurity free case with @xmath19 .",
    "similarly the entanglement properties of the odd sector is identical to those of the original impurity free case with @xmath20 .",
    "in particular , we expect the entanglement entropy for the impurity free case to behave as @xmath21 the considerations above immediately suggest that the impurity will lead to a correction @xmath22    we point out that equations such as receive a contribution proportional to @xmath23 coming from the oscillation at infinity and which is independent of @xmath24 and the scattering length(s ) . on top of that , however , there is a finite contribution that is in general non - vanishing for different @xmath16 , @xmath25 , owing to the fact that cutting off the integration at @xmath24 spoils the orthogonality of the factors in the integrand .",
    "it is this finite piece that contains information about the dependence of the ee on @xmath24 and the scattering lengths .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseshiftintermsofscatteringlength ] ) is exact only for a hard wall potential that excludes the particle from @xmath26 , in which case eq .",
    "( [ eq : continuumeechange ] ) becomes exact . for generic potentials",
    "there are additional corrections to the ee not captured by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseshiftintermsofscatteringlength ] ) , as we will find out in later sections .",
    "we note in passing that qualitatively , most of the considerations above carry over to high d cases with spherically symmetric impurity potentials , as ( i ) they do not mix different angular momentum sectors ; and ( ii ) the asymptotic behavior of the energy eigenstates is uniquely determined by the corresponding phase shift .",
    "quantitatively however , only the s - wave channel of the 3d case works exactly like the 1d case above , and in particular , in the low - energy limit where the @xmath16-dependence of the s - wave scattering phase shift takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the s - wave scattering length , its effects are identical to those of a shift in the subsystem boundary .",
    "we thus consider in the following a special case where we have a 3d spherical that gives rise to s - wave scattering only , with the phase shifts taking the form above . in this case",
    "we find the s - wave energy eigenfunction in subsystem b takes the form @xmath29 , and the corresponding overlap matrix takes the form @xmath30[\\sin(k'r - k ' \\mathfrak{a}^a)/r]dr\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{l - a^s}^{\\infty}\\sin(kr)\\cos(k'r)dr,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we see the effect of @xmath31 is equivalent to shifting the boundary from @xmath24 to @xmath32 .",
    "also noticing the similarity to the 1d odd channel case , we conclude in this 3d case an s - wave scatterer induces a correction to entanglement entropy @xmath33",
    "coming back to the 1d case , we now consider the hamiltonian of a tight binding model with constant hopping amplitude @xmath34 and only one non - zero on - site energy .",
    "we refer to this as the single impurity ( si ) hamiltonian :    @xmath35 + w c_{n}^{\\dagger } c_{n},\\ ] ]    where we choose periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and there is one impurity with strength @xmath36 on a specific site @xmath37 ( we specify @xmath37 below ) .",

    "we note that a single impurity in a free 1d fermi gas is very special .",
    "interactions change its scaling dimension@xcite , making it a relevant perturbation for repulsive interaction , and an irrelevant one for attractive interaction .",
    "we thus expect finite corrections to the entanglement entropy for the former , and a subleading one for the latter , with an exponent varying continuously with interaction strength .",
    "while these conclusions follow straightforwardly from scaling analysis@xcite , it is not immediately clear if there will be oscillatory contributions , and if so , with what period .",
    "these questions deserve further investigation .",
