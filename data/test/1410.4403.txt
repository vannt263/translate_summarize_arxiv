    "contrarily to electron machines , hadron machines are mostly limited by non - linear effects and lifetime problems , in particular for beams with high intensities  @xcite . the limitation appears as a slow emittance increase ( over hours ) or beam losses ( tails and dynamic aperture ) , bad lifetime or other effects such as coherent beam  beam oscillations .",
    "it is important to note that the head - on ( ho ) tune shift depends only on the bunch intensity and the normalized emittance , i.e. is independent of the beta function at the interaction point @xmath0 and the energy as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ho_tune_shift ] ) . for the long - range ( lr ) interactions ,",
    "the tune shift depends on the beam separation @xmath1 , thus on the crossing angle @xmath2 and the beam energy @xmath3 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lr_tune_shift ] ) .",
    "@xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    therefore , identifying the source of these limits has vital significance for the luminosity optimization strategy : if the ho collisions are dominating the beam  beam limit , it is then advantageous to increase the bunch intensity together with the transverse emittance since this would keep the tune shift unaffected and increases the luminosity proportionally to the intensity ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity ] ) ) .",
    "the luminosity is further increased by pushing more the focusing at the interaction point ( ip ) without affecting the beam  beam parameter @xmath7 :    @xmath8    on the other hand , when the machine is limited by the lr interactions , a large number of bunches with a moderate @xmath0 is preferred .",
    "since @xmath9 depends on @xmath0 , any change of the optical function at the ip requires one to adjust the crossing angle @xmath10 to keep the lr tune shift constant , @xmath11    some confusion is related to the maximum expected ho beam  beam tune shift for the lhc .",
    "the nominal ho tune shift was derived from the experience of the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , taking into account possible contributions from the lattice non - linearities and significant lr contributions .",
    "the nominal value of @xmath12 was defined to provide a coherent set of parameters to reach the target luminosity , @xmath13@xmath14s@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be considered as a conservative value and not as a real upper limit , in particular in the absence of strong lr interactions .",
    "early in 2010 , even if no show - stoppers were expected , dedicated experiments and observations during normal operation were planned to check the feasibility of colliding beams with the nominal tune shift estimated in the design report . in the following , we briefly list a few of these fills including the important results observed  @xcite .",

    "an increase of the vertical emittance in beam 2 was observable and thought to be originating from an external excitation not fully understood ( the hump ) .",

    "the initial low lifetime observed was thought to originate from a lattice resonance where the core of the bunch was getting close to the 10th - order resonance ; a small negative shift for the vertical tune ( @xmath29 ) improved the losses and reduced the emittance blow - up since the large tune shift from the collisions will bring the core particles below the resonance .",
