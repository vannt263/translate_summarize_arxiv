    "polymeric liquids subjected to shear flow demonstrate a very peculiar phase behaviour .",
    "their phase diagrams not only contain regions of stability of the different symmetry types ( lamellae , hexagonally packed cylinders and so on ) , but also these regions have an internal structure .",
    "application of shear breaks the rotational symmetry selecting the preferable direction .",
    "thus , at given external parameters ( temperature and shear rate ) a certain orientation of the symmetry pattern with respect to the selected direction is more stable than the others @xcite .",
    "experimentally this phenomena was first observed for the lamellar phase @xcite . in this work a microphase separated poly(ethylene - propylene)-poly(ethylethylene )",
    "diblock copolymer melt was subjected to an oscillatory shear . near the order - disorder transition ( odt ) the lamellae have their normal parallel to the velocity gradient ( the parallel orientation ) at low shear frequencies , while at high shear frequencies the lamellae have their normal parallel to the vorticity direction of the shear flow ( the perpendicular orientation ) . at lower temperatures",
    "the parallel orientation is always the most stable one .",
    "the first theoretical attempt to study the orientational phase transition was by cates and milner @xcite .",
    "they considered the equation of motion for the order parameter with a coupling of applied steady shear to the composition fluctuations .",
    "they found that flow completely changes the fluctuation spectrum . as a result",
    ", the fluctuations of the order parameter are suppressed and the odt temperature is raised .",
    "the authors suggested that the perpendicular orientation is stable near the odt since the composition fluctuations with wave vectors normal to both the velocity and the velocity gradient are the least affected by shear .",
    "later fredrickson has shown that the angle - dependence of the fourth order vertex function is crucial for construction of a realistic non - equilibrium phase diagram . within this framework fredrickson",
    "reproduced the experimental observation by koppi _",
    "the theory fails to describe the selection of the parallel orientation at higher frequencies @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the fredrickson theory to describe the orientational phase transitions in the hexagonal phase of a diblock copolymer melt subjected to steady simple shear flow .",
    "the symmetry pattern of this phase consists of hexagonally packed cylinders made up of blocks of one type immersed in the surroundings of the other blocks ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . in equilibrium",
    "this phase appears in between lamellae and body - centered cubic phase @xcite .",
    "the experiments under shear flow show an analogy with the orientational behaviour of the lamellar phase @xcite . in slow flow",
    "the symmetry pattern has `` 2 dots up '' , while in the faster flow the `` 1 dot up '' orientation appears ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . in order to keep universality we call them the parallel and the perpendicular orientations , respectively .",
    "there have been many observations of the ordering of the hexagonal phase subjected to shear flow @xcite .",
    "recently , tepe _ et al .",
    "_ have varied temperature and shear rate and observed both orientations of the hexagonal pattern in a non - symmetric polyethylene - poly(ethylenepropylene ) ( pe - pep ) diblock copolymer melt .",
    "we schematically present their results in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "our goal is to reproduce this dynamical phase diagram theoretically .",
    "we start with a speculative analogy with lamellae .",
    "both orientations of the hexagonal pattern could be considered as parallel lamellae with different interlamellar distances ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "high shear squeezes the pattern and the lamellae with the smallest interlayer distance are favorable . in very slow shear",
    "the intermolecular forces resulting in microphase separation will play the predominant role and lamellae with the biggest interlayer distance are stable .",
    "such simple reasoning already reproduces the main features of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we proceed with more exact and motivated analysis . in section",
    "ii we formulate a dynamical model and study its equilibrium limit . in sections",
    "iii and iv we apply the methods of fredrickson @xcite to analyze the high - shear and low - shear behaviour . in the conclusions we compare the orientational behaviour of the hexagonal and lamellar phases and explain the origin of difficulties in experimental study of this behaviour .",

    "it means that we ignored any alteration of the velocity profile caused by the internal structure of the melt .",
    "fredrickson has showed @xcite that by taking into account different viscosities of the two blocks one can approximate the real velocity profile by the same functional form @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a renormalized shear rate : @xmath12    in lamellar phase at high shear , the lamellae are perpendicular at high temperatures , and parallel at low temperatures .",
    "fredrickson has shown that the orientation - dependent hydrodynamic corrections are needed to explain this transition . in hexagonal phase such an effect at high shear",

    "thus , by introducing the fields @xmath22 we obtain an analytic continuation of the free energy to the dynamic case @xcite .",
    "this is possible because our model is conservative @xcite .    as our last simplification we introduce an approximation for the vertex functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "since we use the principle - harmonic approximation in ( [ e2.5 ] ) , we assume that all wavevectors have the same modulus @xmath29 .",

    "the fluctuation integral ( [ e2.10 ] ) takes into account the fluctuations of the order parameter @xcite and renormalizes the temperature in the system .",
    "because of the angle - dependence of the 4th - order vertex function @xmath28 ( eq.[e2.8.1 ] ) , the renormalized temperature also has an angle - dependence . expanding it to the first order in @xmath39",

    "the amplitudes @xmath54 that minimize the potential @xmath26 are found by solving the set of equations @xmath61 .",
    "its most important feature is that @xmath62 does not depend on the @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the resulting equations are isotropic with respect to @xmath54 and the solution has the form @xmath63 .    to explore the stability region of the hexagonal phase",
    "we need to solve the resulting system of equations for given temperature and composition : @xmath64 the calculation technique of fredrickson and helfand @xcite allows us to demonstrate the influence of the @xmath39-terms on the equilibrium phase diagram . in fig.[graph1 ] and fig.[graph2 ] we show that the approximation ( [ e2.8.1 ] ) results in a non - significant quantitative shift of values .",
    "the effect of @xmath39 on the equilibrium phase diagram is tiny , but in the next section we will demonstrate that @xmath39 is dominant in explaining the dynamical orientational ordering .",
    "to study the orientational dynamics in the strong - shear regime we need to solve ( [ e2.11 ] ) and ( [ e2.12 ] ) in the limit @xmath65 . in this case",
    "it is impossible to obtain a solution of ( [ e2.11 ] ) as a perturbation series in @xmath66 .",

    "one can apply the rg methods @xcite to find the asymptotic behaviour of the structure factor @xmath67 . then",
    ", at large shear rates the structure factor can be approximated by interpolating between @xmath45 and @xmath68 .",

    "unlike the equilibrium situation we do not have any problem with integration ( ( [ h_high ] ) does not depend on both @xmath42 and @xmath40 ) , and the equation for the free energy is straightforward : @xmath76 the amplitudes @xmath54 are the solutions of the equations @xmath77 in the absence of the term @xmath78 these equations have a uniform solution @xmath79 .",
    "the presence of this term breaks the symmetry of the equations and allows for the nonequal amplitudes .",
    "we construct the solutions of ( [ h=0 ] ) as a perturbation series in two small parameters : @xmath80 and @xmath39 .",
    "the highest order in the perturbation series for the amplitudes is determined by the following argument .",
    "our goal is to obtain an angle - dependent free energy .",
    "this angle - dependence can only appear via various but symmetric combinations of the basis vectors @xmath16 .",
    "let us discuss an example : @xmath81 this combination is angle - dependent if @xmath82 .",
    "one can easily check that it is also true for the other symmetric combinations .",
    "the only way for such a combination to enter the equation for the free energy is via a term like @xmath83 , which is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "thus , in what follows we keep terms up to @xmath85 . solving ( [ h_high ] ) for the amplitudes and substituting them into ( [ fe_high ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 the coefficients @xmath87 are given by : @xmath88\\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\lambda}{\\xi}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the dimensionless temperature @xmath89 and kept only the leading terms in @xmath39 for a given order in @xmath80 .",
    "the second term in @xmath90 is the angle - dependent contribution we were looking for .",
    "the spinodal temperature is obtained from the condition : @xmath91 .",

    "up to the first order in @xmath94 we obtain : @xmath95    now we summarize our results . in the high - shear limit",
    "the hexagonal phase is found to be stable in the temperature range from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ( see fig.[fig_diagram ] ) .",
    "here we suppose that hexagonal phase is the first phase appearing at cooling down from melt .",
    "if this is not a case , the temperature range @xmath98 transforms to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a transition temperature from a hypothetic ( bcc , gyroid , ... ) to the hexagonal phase .",
    "the factor in front of @xmath101 in the equation for @xmath102 is negative .",
    "this means that the spinodal temperature is higher for the orientation with @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the free - energy is minimal for this orientation for all values of temperature from the range @xmath98 .",
    "thus we predict the perpendicular orientation to be the only stable orientation in the high - shear limit .",
    "we emphasize that the appearance of the angle - dependence in the free energy only in the @xmath104 is not a coincidence .",
    "it reflects the internal symmetry of the system .",
    "any figure on plane can be oriented with respect to the particular direction only if its shape deviates from circle . in other words ,",
    "if one expands the figure s shape into the plane waves around circle : @xmath105 $ ] , the interaction with a selected direction will appear in the first non - zero order .",
    "for hexagons it gives @xmath106 .",
    "the n - th order in the expansion corresponds to the interaction between @xmath107 different wavevectors .",
    "taking into account that the parameter @xmath39 introduces the _ pare - wise _ interaction between vectors ( see ( [ e2.8.1 ] ) ) , we conclude that the angle - dependent terms in the free energy should be at least @xmath108 .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath80 is different .",
    "shear breaks the rotational symmetry in the system , stipulating the preferred ( gradient ) direction and allowing for a discrimination between orientations .",
    "thus the angle - dependent terms in the free energy should be proportional at least to the lowest possible power of @xmath80 .",
    "this lowest possible power is determined by the concrete form of the structure factor @xmath109 . in ( [ sigma_high ] )",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath80 enter as a one combination .",
    "so , one would expect the free energy to be angle - dependent starting from the @xmath110 order .",
    "we illustrate the concept with the following example in which we calculate the free energy of systems with other rotational symmetry .",
    "we consider for the moment an artificial phase which the average density is given by : @xmath111 where @xmath112 are two vectors lying in the plane perpendicular to the velocity direction , @xmath113 .",
    "we consider two cases : a ) @xmath114 , which describes square packed cylinders and b ) @xmath115 , which describes highly non - symmetric cylindrical pattern .",
    "calculating the structure constants ( [ str_const ] ) and integrating ( [ e2.12 ] ) with the help of ( [ sigma_high ] ) , we obtain for the free energies : @xmath116 \\frac{\\alpha^{4/3}\\lambda^{1/3}}{3}{\\frak d}^2\\ ] ] @xmath117 \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case a ) the structure deviates from a circle in the second order ( @xmath118 ) , while in the case b ) already in the first order .",
    "this gives @xmath119 and @xmath39 standing in ( [ f_0 ] ) and ( [ f_15 ] ) in front of the angle - dependent terms .",
    "both cases have the same power of @xmath80 as @xmath39 because of ( [ sigma_high ] ) . in the next section",
    "we shall see how a different expression for the fluctuation integral will produce the different lowest possible power of @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we consider the other limit @xmath120 . in this case",
    "the solution of ( [ e2.11])-([e2.12 ] ) only slightly deviates from the equilibrium one and we can construct a perturbation theory with a small parameter @xmath13 .",

    "following the conclusions of the previous section we evaluate @xmath122 up to @xmath108 and the lowest possible order in @xmath13 , which is @xmath123 .",

    "therefore , we keep @xmath125 in the expression for the structure factor . performing integration in ( [ e2.10 ] ) with @xmath122 given by ( [ st_f ] ) and using ( [ e2.10.2 ] ) for @xmath45",

    "we note that in principle the fluctuation integral ( [ sigma_low ] ) contains all possible combinations of powers of @xmath39 and @xmath140 .",
    "according to the symmetry arguments the angle - dependence appears in the lowest possible order in @xmath13 ( which is @xmath140 in this case ) and the third order in @xmath39 .",

    "in the present paper we have shown how the orientational behaviour of the hexagonal phase under simple shear flow can be described in the framework of the dynamical model first developed by fredrickson for the lamellae @xcite . in this model",
    "the angle - dependence of the 4th order vertex function @xmath28 ( see [ e2.8.1 ] ) plays a crucial role , although it is of no importance in equilibrium ( see section ii for details ) .",

    "the only role of the dissipation in our model is to renormalize the shear rate @xmath145 .",
    "since we neglected any alteration of the velocity profile in the sample and simply approximated @xmath146 , the existence of the potential @xmath26 is not surprising .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is a functional of the dissipative effects @xcite , so that only the number @xmath11 enters the dynamic equations .",
