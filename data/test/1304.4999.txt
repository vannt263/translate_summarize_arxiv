    "the upcoming gluex experiment  @xcite in hall d at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) is an experiment that will primarily search for mesons with exotic quantum numbers .",
    "meson states of interest will be produced using a photon beam incident on a proton target .",
    "it is crucial for the experiment to have a detector with good resolution and high acceptance for multi - particle events  studying the angular distributions of decay products is an essential tool in identifying underlying structure of the produced mesons .",
    "the forward calorimeter ( fcal ) will be an essential detector for the experiment , providing energy measurements and timing information for photon showers in the forward region with polar angles @xmath4 and energies between 100  mev and 5  gev .    in the fall of @xmath5 ,",
    "a 25-element miniature version of the fcal was constructed for a beam test underneath the existing photon tagger of hall b  @xcite at jlab .",
    "the main goals were to verify , as expected , that the hardware configuration of the fcal modules would meet the desired energy and timing resolutions .",
    "while many studies with prototypes were performed during the design phase , this represented the first test of the production hardware and data acquisition system in a beam .",
    "below we discuss the results of this beam test and compare them with previous measurements .",
    "the fcal for the gluex experiment consists of @xmath6 lead glass modules , each coupled to its own type feu 84 - 3 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and cockcroft - walton base ( similar to that detailed in ref .",
    "the lead glass blocks were equivalent to type f8 manufactured by the lytkarino optical glass factory  @xcite , and each have transverse dimensions of @xmath7 @xmath8 and are @xmath9 cm long .",
    "the cherenkov light emitted by the electromagnetic showers produced within the lead glass blocks will be detected by the pmts .",
    "the resulting pmt current pulses are digitized by 12-bit @xmath10 mhz flash analog - to - digital converters ( fadcs ) designed by jlab  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fcal_exploded ] shows an expanded view of one of the @xmath6 fcal modules .        the lead glass blocks and most of the pmts are the same as those used in previous experiments , e852 at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite and the radphi experiment at jlab  @xcite .    in the gluex experiment ,",
    "magnetic shielding of the pmts is necessary due to the stray field of the solenoid magnet of up to @xmath11  g. the pmts are placed well within a double layer of soft iron and mu - metal shield . the light collection from the lead glass block to the pmt",
    "is facilitated using a cylindrical acrylic light guide glued to the pmt .",
    "an eljen ej-560 optical interface  cookie \" is used to connect the guide to the lead glass block .",
    "the primary goal for this beam test is to verify that we can achieve the design energy resolution at low energies , where statistical fluctuations in the number of cherenkov photons detected dominate the resolution .",
    "this , in turn , would validate the design of the light collection system using optical photons with the characteristic cherenkov angular distribution inside of the block , a task that had only been performed with ray - tracing simulation .",
    "besides measuring the energy of electromagnetic showers , the fcal will measure the timing of the showers .",
    "during gluex running , the jlab continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) beam will provide an electron beam bunch every @xmath12  ns .",
    "electrons in the bunch interact with a thin diamond crystal radiator to produce a linearly - polarized photon beam . during nominal running configuration",
    "the diamond is oriented so that the coherent bremsstrahlung process produces a peak in both linear polarization and photon flux at photon energies of about 9  gev .",
    "the photon energy is measured by measuring the momentum of the recoil electron using the hall d tagger .",
    "the photon rates are expected to be up to @xmath13 @xmath14 in the coherent peak between @xmath15 and @xmath16  gev , leading to a high rate of signal photons as well as electromagnetic background .",
    "the timing measurements of the fcal will allow identification of the respective beam bunch that created the photon of interest and also help in reducing accidental backgrounds .",
    "a @xmath17 array of fcal modules was constructed at indiana university .",
    "the modules were encased in a light - tight aluminum body , with a gear drive that allowed the modules to be tilted at an angle so that the front face of the modules were perpendicular to the incoming electron trajectories .",
    "figure  [ fig : detector ] shows a drawing of the detector .        for triggering purposes , two arrays of five eljen ej-200 plastic scintillator paddles were placed at the front of the detector .",
    "the three inside paddles had widths of @xmath18 cm , while the two outside paddles were @xmath19 cm wide and used as veto signals to the trigger .",
    "the two arrays were oriented perpendicularly to each other , with the centers of each paddle centered on the border of two modules , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trigger_positions ] .",
    "the scintillators spanned the length of the perpendicular array of modules .",
    "when looking into the detector from the upstream end ( the  beam s eye view \" ) , the horizontal paddles were labeled h1h5 from the top , and the vertical paddles were labeled v1v5 from the left .",
    "each of the trigger paddles were optically connected to the same type feu 84 - 3 pmts used for reading out the detector modules .",
    "the signals from the pmts were converted into nim signals by a discriminator , and the digital output of the discriminators were recorded into the data stream using the same fadcs that were used for recording the pulse height of the lead glass modules .",
    "the trigger arrays were placed in a dark box that was attached to the front of the main detector .",
    "the dark box was made of @xmath20 cm - thick plywood and painted black , with a thin ( @xmath20 mm ) aluminum plate underneath the trigger setup to hold the trigger paddles in place .",
    "array of detector modules is shown as the dashed lines . ]    in addition to the main trigger counters , there was a thin remote paddle located several meters upstream of the detector , along the nominal trajectory of electrons hitting the detector ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hallb ] ) .",
    "the remote paddle was made of a @xmath21 cm - thick plastic scintillator , wrapped in aluminized mylar , and connected to a photonis xp2020 pmt .",
    "the signal was also converted into a nim pulse signal using a discriminator and read out with a fadc channel .",
    "the purpose of this remote paddle was to identify electrons following the nominal electron trajectory during off - line analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : trigger_electronics ] shows a diagram of our trigger logic , which was handled by standard nim modules .",
    "the pmt pulses from each of the @xmath22 modules within the detector array were digitized using a fadc . to trigger the readout of an event event to disk",
    ", we required a hit within at least one of the inside paddles from each array .",
    "the outside paddles were used as vetoes , and the veto signal was also individually recorded .",
    "the beam test was conducted within hall  b at jlab , which housed the clas detector and its photon tagger setup . during our beam test",
    ", the clas collaboration was running the hd - ice experiment with a real photon beam produced by bremsstrahlung , allowing us to use the electrons that had radiated photons .",
    "our beam test was conducted parasitically to this run , and therefore we had no control over the beam energy or intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig : hallb ] shows a schematic of hall b and the tagger setup .",
    "the electron beam from the accelerator comes in from the left and is incident on a very thin radiator foil . immediately following the radiator is the clas tagger magnet , which is a uniform - field dipole magnet .",
    "the electron trajectories are determined by the energy of the electron , and the position and angle at the exit of the magnet can be calculated .",
    "details of the clas tagger setup can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    .",
    "the trajectories of degraded electrons with varying energies are given by the lines originating from the vacuum exit window .",
    "depictions of our detector are shown in the alcove area and floor . ]",
    "the electrons exit the vacuum of the tagger magnet through a very thin exit window  @xcite and pass through the clas tagger detectors called the e - counters and t - counters .",
    "the e - counters are a plane of @xmath23 , @xmath18  mm - thick plastic scintillators that detect the position of each electron for energy identification .",
    "the t - counters form a second plane of @xmath12  cm - thick plastic scintillators that are used for timing identification of the electrons .",
    "the two detector planes are separated by @xmath24  cm , and each counter within each plane is rotated so that it is facing normal to the incoming trajectory of electrons .    in our beam test , the detector was placed mainly in the area seen in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : hallb ] that we call the alcove .",
    "the detector was placed at the calculated location that intercepted electrons with @xmath25 of the accelerator beam energy and was angled to face the incoming electrons .",
    "we also placed the detector in the floor area ( right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : hallb ] ) , where data were collected at a higher electron energy fraction . due to mechanical interference and",
    "running constraints , we could not properly align the detector in the floor area , and hence did not use those runs for our energy resolution measurements ( sec .",
    "[ section : energyresolution ] ) . however , since the timing resolution studies ( sec .",
    "[ section : timingresolution ] ) are not very sensitive to the detector alignment , we utilized these runs for this purpose , as they had the largest range of signal sizes .",
    "for the energy resolution studies , our detector position was fixed and data were taken at three separate accelerator energies , allowing us to measure the energy resolution for these energies .",
    "the three runs that were used for our results had accelerator energies of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 gev .",
    "each run had approximately @xmath29 events .",
    "each channel of the fadcs samples the pmt output voltage every @xmath18 ns , and @xmath30 samples were stored for each event .",
    "figure  [ fig : single_eventdisplay ] shows the read out samples from a single channel in one event .",
    "however , zero - suppression was implemented by setting a pre - programmed threshold and only channels that had at least one signal sample larger than this threshold were written to the output stream .",
    "the threshold applied to each channel was based on the pedestal , or baseline , which was measured without any input signals .",
    "the threshold was set to @xmath31 adc counts above the pedestal .",
    "off - line studies showed that the resolution worsens with larger thresholds .",
    "after data taking , it was discovered that the thresholds for modules in the top two rows were inadvertently set much higher , leading to a significantly worse energy resolution .",
    "therefore , the sub - sample of events with showers centered on these modules were not used in the determination of the energy resolution ( see sec .  [",
    "subsection : energyresolution : final ] ) .",
    "the module response to energy deposited in the lead glass is obtained by summing the pedestal - subtracted samples over a range of time .",
    "this range was optimized and was @xmath24 samples ( or 80 ns ) starting at sample @xmath32 .",
    "the sum was performed off - line for the beam test , although for the gluex experiment the determination of the signal size and time will be computed in field - programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) to manage the size of the output data stream .",
    "the first step in our analysis was to ensure that we had a sample of events that had one and only one electron signal with the correct timing .",
    "therefore , a preliminary skim was applied to the data to extract such events . for each inside trigger scintillator",
    ", we determined the pedestal by taking the average of the first eight samples recorded . to exclude events that had an unstable pedestal , we removed events that had channels with a pedestal rms greater than @xmath12 .",
    "this eliminated events that were on the tail of a previous event and also noise fluctuations at the beginning of the event .    next , to ensure that the timing of the event was correct ,",
    "the recorded nim signals were examined and a coincidence in the leading edges was required . also , events with a prolonged or second signal were removed .",
    "finally , we required that only one horizontal and vertical trigger combination satisfied all of our trigger conditions to ensure that there were not two separate incoming electrons .",
    "similar requirements on the pedestal rms and timing of the signal were made on the remote paddle based on the distribution of the data .",
    "we verified no signal was present on the veto just before or after the triggered events .",
    "for all detector modules , if any sample indicated an underflow or overflow in the adc counts , that event was removed .",
    "the requirements on the trigger counters removed @xmath31@xmath0 of the data , while the requirements on the remote paddle removed @xmath33@xmath34 of our initial data sample indicating that our detector was frequently triggered by electrons that did nt pass through narrow angular range that was spanned by the remote paddle at the exit of the tagger window .      the total signal size for the event is given by summing the signals from all modules .",
    "for each run , the distribution of the total signal is fit with a gaussian function and linear background .",
    "the width @xmath35 of this distribution divided by the centroid is then the measured resolution .",
    "below we outline the procedure that was used to optimize the resolution consistently over all runs .",
    "prior to the beam test , the gain characteristics for the pmts for each module were measured , and the high voltage ( hv ) settings were adjusted to equalize the gains . with these initial settings , data were taken to measure the initial energy resolution . a software gain balancing technique was then applied to minimize the event - to - event variance of the sum over all modules by scaling the signal size from each module by a constant module - dependent gain factor .",
    "this minimization can be formulated in terms of a lagrangian multiplier method , which is described in detail in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the mass squared of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mesons were used as constraints and measured differences from the meson masses squared were minimized .",
    "we fixed the average total signal size ( in arbitrary units ) , and the standard deviation from this average was minimized .",
    "such a problem is linear with respect to the gain factors and can be solved exactly , so that no iteration of the minimization is necessary .",
    "next , using the computed gain factors , we adjusted the hv values based on knowledge of the gain characteristics of each pmt to better equalize the gains of the pmts",
    ". finally , we repeated the gain factor determination , and utilized these gain factors in our analysis .",
    "we explored the stability of our software gain - balancing procedure by selecting events whose sum were within @xmath38 or @xmath39 of the mean and determined gain constants for both sets .",
    "this selection reduces the influence of non - gaussian tails on the computation of the variance and the gain constants .",
    "our results are therefore given as the average resolution from these selections , with an error given by half the difference , which is negligible on the scale of other systematic uncertainties in the determination of the energy resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : run474 - 476_signaldist ] demonstrates the method of determining the resolution and shows the distribution of the total signal from all modules for two given runs at the same incoming electron energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : run474 - 476_signaldist](a ) shows a run in which we used our initial hv settings without the pmt hv adjustments , and fig .  [",
    "fig : run474 - 476_signaldist](b ) is for a run when it was applied . for each case ,",
    "the black hollow histogram is the distribution before the software gain balancing procedure is applied , and the gray ( red online ) hatched histogram is after .",
    "we see that software gain balancing is essential to obtaining optimal resolution , and the resolution is best when software corrections are applied to approximately equal - gain modules to start , _",
    "i.e. _ , the precision that is lost when a low gain module is digitized by the fadc can not be recovered by a simple multiplicative constant . in principle",
    ", one can continue to iterate hardware hv adjustments based on software gain constants ; however , we performed only one such hv adjustment and utilized the software gain balancing procedure for all subsequently analyzed data .",
    "corrections for energy loss and scattering in the material before the electrons entered the detector were determined using a geant4-based  @xcite simulation program . for each simulated data set , nominal energies for the electrons were chosen to correspond to actual electron energies used in the data collection .",
    "the fractional spread of the actual cebaf electron beam is of order @xmath40 and is negligible .",
    "electrons were produced with energies centered around this value and with a range of @xmath41 to cover the range of rays that would scatter into our acceptance .",
    "for each event , the incident angle and position with which the electron exited the vacuum window were calculated based on the clas tagger geometry .",
    "the electron energy distribution was modeled on a realistic bremsstrahlung distribution .    using the simulation , we recorded the distribution of total incoming energy into our detector .",
    "the same trigger conditions as used in the analysis of the data were imposed on the simulated events .",
    "we fit the incoming energy distribution for our final selection of events with a gaussian function to determine the mean and width .",
    "we concluded that the mean incoming energy into our detector was @xmath42@xmath43 mev lower than the nominal energy with a spread of @xmath18@xmath19 mev .",
    "table  [ tab : simulation_results ] summarizes the results of our simulation for all energies . with the assumption that the intrinsic detector resolutions and the spread of energies add in quadrature",
    ", we can subtract this contribution to obtain the intrinsic detector resolution .",
    ".[tab : simulation_results ] predicted energy and spread of electrons incident on the detector during three run periods .",
