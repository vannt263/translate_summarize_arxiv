    "it is widely believed that the quantum choromodynamics ( qcd ) exhibits a phase transition at some temperature @xmath1 , and quarks and gluons confined in the low temperature phase are liberated to form `` quark gluon plasma '' . at the beginning of 2000 , cern reported that the qgp state had been created in the heavy ion collision experiment@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the @xmath0 suppression @xcite is regarded as a key signal of qgp formation .",
    "more reliable inspection will be performed in rhic project at bnl .    on the theoretical side , in spite of various approaches ,",
    "we are still far from definite understanding of charmonium properties near the transition and the fate of the hadronic states in the plasma phase .",
    "we investigate this problem using lattice qcd , which enables us to incorporate the nonperturbative effect of qcd .",
    "the difficulties in studying the heavy quarkonium state at finite temperature can be categorized into two classes : ( i ) difficulties to obtain detailed information on the heavy quarkonium correlators at finite temperature , and ( ii ) analyses of the obtained correlators . although it is difficult to overcome the latter ,",
    "the former is possible to be solved by employing the techniques developed in recent years .    at high temperature ,",
    "sufficient information on the temporal correlator requires high resolution in the temporal direction . to achieve large temporal cutoff with limited computational resources ,",
    "we employ the anisotropic lattice , on which the temporal lattice spacing is finer than the spatial one @xcite .",
    "calculations with a heavy quark need further implementation .",
    "the standard lattice action contains large systematic uncertainty for the quark mass larger than or comparable to the lattice cutoff .",
    "this problem was reexamined with the light of effective theoretical interpretation of the wilson ( and clover ) quark action by fnal group @xcite .",
    "their approach is well - matched with to the anisotropic lattice , since it naturally introduces the anisotropy in the spatial and the temporal hopping parameters .",
    "we employ this approach to describe the heavy quark on present lattices , which have not sufficiently large spatial cutoff compared with the charm quark mass .",
    "the latter problems , ( ii ) , are much more difficult to be overcome .",
    "this is because one is inevitably enforced to extract the spectral properties from the data at the short temporal distance , where high frequency component of the dynamics is significant . at present , there is no well - established way of lattice simulations to attack the spectroscopy at @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason , lattice studies of hadrons at finite temperature have been argued on the spatial correlation ( screening mass ) @xcite .",
    "recently , qcd - taro collaboration ( including three of us ) analyzed the space - time structure of the mesonic correlators in the temporal direction to examine the temperature effect on them @xcite .",
    "they caught a sign of the bound state even in the deconfined phase , as well as an indication of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "their strategy seems one of the best approaches also to the present subject , and is expected to give us novel information on the fate of charminium near the phase transition . therefore we proceed the analysis with the following steps .    at @xmath4",
    "we construct good meson operators which has large overlap with the state of interest .",
    "temperature effects are observed in the meson correlator between the operators constructed in the previous step .",
    "we define the `` wave function '' in the coulomb gauge at finite temperature , and observe its @xmath5-dependence below and above @xmath1 to discuss the possibility of the bound state at @xmath6 .",
    "the quark action we use is in the following form .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 + where @xmath9 .",
    "the bare anisotropy @xmath10 of the fermion field appears in the ratio of the spatial and the temporal hopping parameters , @xmath11 .",
    "the wilson parameter in this form is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the renormalized anisotropy : @xmath14 .",
    "the hopping parameters are related to the bare quark mass as @xmath15 .",
    "we also define @xmath16 with @xmath17 as the parameter which plays the same role as @xmath16 on the isotropic lattice . as the field strength @xmath18 , we use the standard clover - leaf definition . at the tree level ,",
    "the coefficients of the clover terms , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are unity .",
    "this action is obtained by generalizing the form in @xcite to the anisotropic lattice , and by setting @xmath12 .",
    "this choice of the wilson term is adopted so that the action restores the axial interchange symmetry in the physical unit as @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we can use the same form in the light quark region as the @xmath22 improved wilson quark action @xcite .",
    "this is the reason that our form of the action is different from the form used in @xcite .    on the anisotropic lattice",
    ", we need additional tuning of the parameters called as `` calibration '' , to ensure the renormalized anisotropy is same for the gauge and the fermion fields @xcite .",
    "we define the fermionic anisotropy @xmath23 using the dispersion relation of the pseudoscalar and the vector mesons and tune the value of @xmath10 so that @xmath23 coincides with the gauge field anisotropy @xmath13 .",
    "we incorporate the mean - field improvement @xcite : @xmath24 ( @xmath251,2,3 ) and @xmath26 with the mean - field values of the spatial and the temporal link variables , @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined in the landau gauge .",
    "numerical calculation is done on the lattice of sizes @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the standard wilson gauge action at the coupling @xmath32 and the bare anisotropy @xmath33 , in the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "on @xmath34 lattice , the renormalized anisotropy and the spatial lattice spacing from the string tension are determined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 gev .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath31 lattices correspond to the temperatures @xmath39 0.93 @xmath1 , 1.15 @xmath1 and 1.5 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we calculate the meson correlators at @xmath4 with the three sets of the parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath10 ) listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",

    ", we employ the variational analysis .",

    "[ fig : vanal ]    figure  [ fig : vanal ] shows the effective masses of the diagonalized correlators with two largest eigenvalues ( smallest masses ) .",
    "both correlators show plateaus beyond @xmath53 , though the statistical fluctuation is large for the correlator corresponding to the first excited state .",
    "we fit these data at @xmath54@xmath55 and find the meson masses in 2@xmath49 states as @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the lattice unit .",
    "although these give 1@xmath49 - 2@xmath49 splitting smaller than the experimental value , considering the large systematic uncertainty on this coarse lattice , they are not inconsistent results .",
    "we regard the operator corresponds to the ground state in this analysis as the optimized meson operator at @xmath4 .",
    "we start the argument at @xmath3 with the temperature dependence of the correlator between the optimized operators at @xmath4 difined in the previous section .",
    "figure  [ fig : ep ] shows the effective mass plot at finite temperatures in the vector channel . below @xmath1 ( @xmath58 ) , the plateaus of the effective mass seem to appear .",
    "although the effective mass of the ground state is slightly larger than that at @xmath4 , it is difficult to identify the plateau precisely and determine the mass quantitatively with present statistics .",
    "more detailed analysis with higher statistics may open a stage to discuss the potential mass shift of charmonium near to the @xmath1 @xcite .      above @xmath1 ( @xmath59 and @xmath31 )",
    ", the correlators do not show any clear plateau in the effective mass plot .",
    "they decrease more rapidly than expected from the behavior at @xmath58 in both of the correlators correspond to the ground and the first excited states at @xmath4 .",
    "the ps channel shows similar feature , although the decrease of the effective mass is slightly milder .",
    "these behavior at least signal significant change in the nature of the correlators when the system crosses @xmath1 . in @xcite , the ( effective )",
    "masses increase as @xmath60 in the pseudoscalar and the vector channels . the observed behavior in present work ,",
    "however , shows qualitatively different nature of the correlators .    to discuss the spatial correlation between quark and antiquark at @xmath3",
    ", we observe the `` wave function '' normalized at the spatial origin , @xmath61 @xmath62 if there is no bound state , like as with the free quark propagators , this wave function @xmath63 broadens with @xmath5 for any source smearing function .",
    "in contrast , the existence of the stable shape of @xmath63 give us a hint on the existence of the bound state .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefunc ] shows the @xmath5-dependence of the wave function normalized at the spatial origin in the vector channel at @xmath6420 and 12 .",
    "the source function of these correlators are taken to be wider than the optimized one , to show clearly that @xmath63 keeps narrow shape . at the both @xmath65 , the wave function gradually decrease as @xmath5 , in contrast to the case with the free quark poropagators shown together .",
    "this indicates that the quark and antiquark tend to stay together even in the deconfined phase , up to 1.5 @xmath1 .",
    "these two observations are interesting , and at the same time puzzling .",
    "obviously , the phase transition causes significant change in the charmonium correlators , especially in the vector channel . on the other hand ,",
    "the result of the wave function suggests the persistence of the bound states .",
    "one natural picture is that the mesonic spectral function still have a peak with rather large width above @xmath1 .",
    "this explains both of our observations .",
    "direct extraction of the spectral function from the lattice data @xcite may give us further information .",
    "for the definite understanding of the fate of chamonium at the phase transition , we need more systematic studies and development of procedures .",
