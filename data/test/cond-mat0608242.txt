    "the properties of quasi - one - dimensional conductors have been subject of intensive studies for half a century .",
    "a theory based on the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model predicts a non - fermi - liquid metallic state.@xcite the situation , however , develops differently when the filling of the system is commensurate , since in this case , electronic interactions may cause a mott insulating state .",
    "although this phenomenon is possible in all dimensions , it is particularly strong in the 1d case via umklapp process.@xcite the influence of the interchain coupling on the electronic properties of a half- and quarter - filled quasi-1d interacting electron system was studied theoretically.@xcite it is predicted@xcite that with increasing interchain transfer integral @xmath6 such a system undergoes a deconfinement transition into a metallic state . the schematic phase diagram illustrating this phenomenon",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deconfine ] .",
    "strictly speaking , the deconfinement transition takes place at @xmath7 when @xmath6 becomes larger than a certain value @xmath8 and can be referred to as a quantum phase transition . for @xmath9",
    "the system is in a mott insulating state and the single - particle interchain hopping is completely suppressed . if the interchain transfer integral exceeds a critical value @xmath8 , the insulating state is broken and single - particle interchain hopping becomes possible .",
    "thus , the system evolves from a 1d mott - hubbard insulator to a high - dimensional metallic state ( trajectory 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : deconfine ] ) .",
    "the theoretical study@xcite of two coupled hubbard chains predicts a close relation of the interchain transfer integral to the charge gap , @xmath10.@xcite while in a simple two - chain system no real deconfinement is observed,@xcite for a large ( infinite ) number of chains@xcite the crossover is expected at some critical value @xmath11.@xcite     when @xmath12 reaches a critical value @xmath13 ( trajectory 1 ) . at high enough temperature",
    ", the increase of @xmath12 leads to a transition from a mott insulating to a 1d luttinger liquid ( ll ) conducting state ( trajectory 2 ) and finally to a dimensional crossover into an hdm state ( trajectory 3 ) .",
    "the temperature change at a fixed value @xmath12 may also lead to a transition from a mott insulating to a ll state ( trajectory 4 ) , or to a dimensional crossover ( trajectory 5 ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the path of our pressure study.[fig : deconfine],title=\"fig : \" ] +    if the temperature or energy scale at which the response of the system is probed becomes larger than @xmath12 , the warping of the open fermi surface is masked .",
    "therefore , the properties of the system are virtually the same as in the case of a flat fermi surface , i.e. , for a strictly 1d system where the interacting electrons are described by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model.@xcite thus , the deconfinement transition at high enough temperature leads to a crossover from a mott insulating to a ll metallic state ( see trajectories 2 and 4 in fig .  [",
    "fig : deconfine ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a dimensional crossover from a ll to a high - dimensional metallic state occurs when the interchain coupling ( i.e. , the warping of the fermi surface ) becomes larger than the energy of thermal fluctuations ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the transfer integral @xmath15 ( trajectory 3 ) or by lowering the temperature ( trajectory 5 ) . in the high - dimensional metallic state",
    "the fermi - liquid description is valid instead of the ll model .",
    "suitable systems to study the predicted dimensional crossover and deconfinement transition are the well - known organic bechgaard - fabre salts@xcite ( tmttf)@xmath16 and ( tmtsf)@xmath16 .",
    "they consist of weakly coupled molecular stacks along which the charge transport occurs . hereby , the type of the molecule ( tmtsf or tmttf ) and of the anions @xmath17 determine the coupling between the molecular stacks and thus the dimensionality of the system ( chemical pressure effect ) . in particular , the ( tmttf)@xmath16 salts consist of basically uncoupled chains , which are half - filled due to the dimerization along the chains .",
    "thus , they constitute systems of electrons confined to the chains , forming a mott insulating state , and are located on the left side of the diagram given in fig .  [",
    "fig : deconfine ] . at low temperatures",
    "the mott insulating state of ( tmttf)@xmath16 salts is transformed into a charge - ordered state characterized by a disproportion of charge of the donor tmttf molecules within the stacks .",
    "this ferroelectric transition is strongly pressure - dependent , and the charge - ordered phase can be suppressed by the application of a moderate pressure of a few kbars.@xcite on the other hand , the compounds ( tmtsf)@xmath16 represent examples of quasi-1d metals and they are on the right side of the diagram , since the enhanced interchain coupling leads to a charge deconfinement .    the low - temperature optical conductivity spectra of the tmtsf salts along the stacks are characterized by two distinct features : a narrow mode at zero energy containing a very small part of the spectral weight and a high - energy mode centered at around 200  @xmath18.@xcite the latter feature was interpreted in terms of the mott ( charge ) gap of a 1d insulator.@xcite the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity in the energy range above the effective interchain transfer integral [ about 250  @xmath18  for @xmath19 is well described by a ll model , since the system can be considered as effectively one - dimensional . on the other hand , the zero - energy mode was suggested to originate from the effective doping of the 1d mott insulator due to the deconfined interchain electron hopping .",
    "thus , it is related to 2d physics and could be successfully described by the fermi - liquid model.@xcite similar on - chain optical conductivity spectra with the dominating mott gap were also observed for tmttf compounds.@xcite however , the zero - energy mode typical for tmtsf salts is absent , since these systems are in the confined state where interchain hopping is suppressed .",
    "thus , optical spectroscopy on the high - energy range ( larger than the interchain transfer integral ) addresses electronic interactions in 1d , while dc resistivity measurements are more susceptible to interchain hopping and thus reveal deviations from a strictly 1d picture .",
    "first hints for the deconfinement transition and the dimensional crossover were found by pressure - dependent transport measurements on ( tmttf)@xmath20pf@xmath21 and @xmath22  crystals.@xcite the effect of the dimensional crossover occurring during the temperature decrease was addressed by an optical study of @xmath22.@xcite lateron , the above - mentioned theoretical criterium for the deconfinement transition was verified by comparing the ambient - pressure optical spectra of different bechgaard - fabre salts,@xcite i.e. , making use of the effect of chemical pressure on the interchain coupling . however",
    ", this approach has disadvantages , since only a limited number of discrete pressure points corresponding to particular compounds are available . moreover , atomic substitution ( especially for sulfur and selenium atoms ) may appreciably affect not only the interchain transfer integral @xmath12 , but also the stack dimerization , on - chain bandwidth , coulomb repulsion etc .    a more direct and cleaner way to study",
    "the deconfinement transition experimentally is the application of external pressure , since the changes in the electrodynamic response can be monitored while the interchain coupling is being continuously tuned . in this paper",
    "we present the results of the first pressure - dependent infrared spectroscopic study on the salt @xmath0 which is a prime example of a 1d mott - hubbard insulator at ambient pressure.@xcite the main aim of the present investigation is to determine the pressure - induced changes in the optical response of @xmath0  during the deconfinement transition and the dimensional crossover . during our experiment",

    "[ fig : deconfine ] ) is expected to occur when the mott - hubbard gap @xmath118 equals approximately @xmath119.@xcite in order to verify this condition , we estimate the pressure dependence of the charge gap @xmath120 using the expression for a 1d quarter - filled mott - hubbard insulator@xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the bandwidth and @xmath123 the coupling constant of the corresponding umklapp process . the pressure dependence of @xmath5 was obtained from the analysis of the longitudinal optical response .",
    "as already discussed , our experiment indicates that the bandwidth @xmath124 does not strongly depend on pressure and amounts to 560  mev . using the value of @xmath125  mev known from dc resistivity measurements,@xcite",
    "the umklapp coupling constant at ambient pressure can be calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) and amounts to @xmath126  mev . since the increase of @xmath5 with increasing pressure ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : slopes ] ) indicates a decrease of the electronic interaction , @xmath127 should decrease as well .",
    "the functional relation between @xmath127 and @xmath5 is , however , not known for the case of a strong non - local electron repulsion when @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we calculated the pressure - dependent charge gap @xmath120 assuming that all parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) except @xmath5 are pressure - independent .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath120 as a function of pressure is depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : bandwidth - b ] .    according to the temperature - pressure phase diagram , which is based on pressure - dependent resistivity measurements on the closely related ( tmttf)@xmath20pf@xmath21 compound,@xcite the deconfinement transition occurs at a pressure of 1  gpa at room temperature .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than the pressure of the deconfinement transition in @xmath0  obtained in the present study .",
    "possibly , this discrepancy is related to the criteria which were used to specify the transition : in the mentioned work of moser _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the deconfinement transition was identified based on the resistivity behavior along the @xmath1 axis , whereas in the present work we refer to the onset of the charge transport along the @xmath3 direction .",

    "the drude response is overdamped ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) in the whole studied pressure range . thus , even at 6  gpa @xmath0  is presumably in a 1d ll state , and the dimensional crossover is expected to occur only at even higher pressure . according to the linear extrapolation ( not shown ) of the pressure dependence of @xmath103 ( which is proportional to @xmath4 ) the condition @xmath133 for the dimensional crossover is fulfilled at a pressure of @xmath134 = 12.8  gpa .",
    "the estimated value of the interchain transfer integral at this pressure is @xmath135  mev .",
    "the so - obtained value of @xmath134 does not agree with the results of dc resistivity measurements along @xmath50 published by moser et al.@xcite there , a strong increase of the dimensional crossover temperature @xmath136 with application of pressure was demonstrated , such that @xmath136 should reach room temperature at 3  gpa for ( tmttf)@xmath20pf@xmath21 and at 1  gpa for @xmath22 .",
    "the former value is smaller by a factor of about four compared to our estimation based on the criterium of the underdamped drude response .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this criterium should not be used for the precise determination of the dimensional crossover pressure or temperature . rather , the observation of a well underdamped drude response ( @xmath137 ) could be taken as a criterium that the system can no longer be considered as one - dimensional .",

    "the corresponding ll exponent @xmath5 increases from 0.13 to 0.19 indicating a weakening of the electronic interaction .",

    "the analysis of the data suggests a linear pressure - induced change of the interchain transfer integral @xmath4 .",
    "the absence of a noticeable drude component below @xmath140  gpa and its appearance above this pressure is interpreted in terms of a pressure - induced deconfinement transition at @xmath130 . for this pressure value",
