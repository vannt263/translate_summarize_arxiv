    "the emergence of classical dynamical chaos from more profound quantum mechanics is one of the most intriguing problems in physics @xcite .",
    "dynamical chaos in classical mechanics is a special kind of random motion in dynamical systems without any noise and random parameters that is characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions in a bounded phase space .",
    "the current consensus is that _ isolated bounded quantum systems _ do not show sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the same way as classical systems because their evolution is unitary .",
    "so the question is : what is the fundamental mechanism of arising classical chaos from quantum mechanics ?",
    "the purpose of this lecture is to show how classical hamiltonian chaos with sensitive dependence on initial conditions , positive lyapunov exponents , fractal properties of underlying phase space , and anomalous statistical characteristics may arise from quantum electrodynamics of a single atom strongly interacting with a quantized mode of the electromagnetic radiation field in a high - quality cavity .",
    "the study of the fundamental atom - photon interaction constitutes the rapidly growing field of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental state of the art has reached in this field the stage where the transition from classical to quantum dynamical regimes can now be probed directly .",
    "atoms and photons , confined in a high - quality cavity , are ideal objects to study quantum - classical correspondence and quantum chaos .",
    "real quantum systems are not isolated .",
    "they interact with their environment and in attempts to measure their states with classical measuring devices which should , by virtue of their purpose , be in unstable states .",
    "so we are dealing with quantum - classical hybrids .",
    "it is not a simple question which degrees of freedom should be considered in a given physical situation as quantum ones and which ones as classical .",
    "let us consider an excited atom in a single - mode high - quality cavity whose frequency is close to the frequency of one of the atomic electrodipole transitions .",
    "the atom emits a photon in the cavity mode and goes to a lower - lying state . under the conditions of the strong atom - field coupling",
    ", the photon may be reemitted and reabsorbed by the atom many times .",
    "sooner or later , the atom will emit a photon in one of the other modes of the electromagnetic field that are not sustained by the cavity ( for example , transverse modes in an open fabry - perot cavity ) and the photon will be lost in a surrounding , the process known as spontaneous emission . in real experiments , the cavity relaxation due to the losses in the cavity walls can not be neglected .",
    "it is usually modeled by a weak coupling of the selected cavity mode with a bath of harmonic oscillators ( spanning a wide frequency range ) in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature .",
    "sooner or later , the atom will relax to a lower - lying state that is not resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "it seems to be reasonable to treat two near - resonant atomic levels , strongly coupled to a cavity mode , as a quantum dynamical system weakly coupled to the other electromagnetic modes , the other atomic levels and the cavity walls .",
    "an infinite number of the respective degrees of freedom , which are coupled to the quantum dynamical system s degrees of freedom but are not affected by them , forms an inexhaustible external reservoir ( that may be treated classically ) usually called  the environment \" .",
    "it is a kind of the external coupling which is inevitably present in reality .",
    "there is another kind of coupling called the dynamical coupling .",
    "for example , if the average number of photons in the cavity mode is sufficiently large , one may treat the field as a classical object dynamically coupled to quantized atoms ( the semiclassical approximation ) and take into account the feedback effect of the atoms on the radiation field .",
    "the semiclassical approximation breaks down when we deal with single cold atoms and photons in a cavity .",
    "in this situation we should take into account the translational ( external ) atomic degree of freedom .",
    "when a cold atom emits and absorbs photons its momentum and position may vary significally due to the recoil effect . the external atomic degree of freedom , which may be treated classically if the values of the atomic momentum are greater than the photon momentum , is dynamically coupled to the internal atomic and field degrees of freedom which are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "we show in this lecture that , even in the absence of any other interaction with the environment , the interaction of the quantum atom - field system with the external atomic degree of freedom provides , under appropriate conditions , the emergence of classical chaos from quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the discovery that a single - mode laser , a symbol of coherence and stability , may exhibit deterministic chaos is especially important not only because lasers are one of the main instruments in physics but lasers , as well , provide almost ideal systems to test general ideas in quantum mechanics and statistical physics . from the standpoint of nonlinear dynamics , laser is an open dissipative system that transforms an external excitation into a coherent output in the presence of loss .",
    "some manifestations of strange attractors and dissipative chaos have been observed with different types of lasers ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "a collection of identical two - level atoms , interacting with a single - mode electromagnetic field , provides the simplest model for laser dynamics . because of a large number of atoms ( and photons )",
    ", laser dynamics can be adequately described in the so - called semiclassical approximation , where one treats atoms as two - level objects , which may be described by the bloch equations for two components of the collective electrodipole polarisation and collective atomic population inversion , interacting with a field mode to be governed by the classical maxwell equations for the field strengths with the right hands depending on the atomic polarisation . with a single - mode",
    "homogeneously broadened laser , operating in resonance with the gain center , these five equations can be reduced to three real - valued equations for slowly varying amplitudes which have been shown to be equivalent to the well - known lorentz model for fluid convection @xcite .",
    "practically in the same time , ideas of dynamical chaos have been explored with fundamental models of the matter - radiation interaction , comprising of a collection of two - level atoms _ interacting with their own radiation field _ in a perfect single - mode cavity without any loss and external excitation .",
    "it has been shown theoretically and numerically @xcite that the semiclassical maxwell ",
    "bloch equations , following from the dicke hamiltonian @xcite , may demonstrate _",
    "hamiltonian semiclassical chaos _",
    "if one goes beyond the so - called rotating - wave approximation , i.  e. if one takes into account energy non - conserving terms in the hamiltonian ( for details , see the beginning of the next section ) .",
    "this mechanism of arising hamiltonian semiclassical chaos is rather weak under realistic assumptions . on the other hand , rotating - wave approximation suppresses chaos with atoms at rest due to existence of an additional integral of motion , the conserving interaction energy .",
    "it has been shown in a series of our papers @xcite that hamiltonian chaos may arise within the rotating - wave approximation under conditions of a modulation of the atom - field interaction . in a natural way it occurs",
    "when atoms move through a cavity in a direction along which the cavity sustains a standing - wave field that is periodic in space @xcite .",
    "when moving with a constant velocity , atoms `` see '' the field whose strength changes in time periodically .",
    "it breaks down the interaction - energy integral and may cause hamiltonian semiclassical chaos of a homoclinic type @xcite .",
    "there are another ways of modulations to be considered in @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the detuning between the atomic transition frequency and the frequency of the field mode has been shown to produce parametric instability and hamiltonian semiclassical chaos @xcite .",
    "structural hamiltonian chaos @xcite may arise as a result of a harmonic modulation of cavity length which causes the respective oscillations of the nodes of a standing - wave .",
    "generally speaking , the model of the atom - field interaction should involve not only the internal atomic and field degrees of freedom but also the center - of - mass motion of the atom . when emitting and absorbing photons , atoms not only change their internal states but their position and momentum are changed as well due the photon recoil effect .",
    "this effect may be neglected if one deals with rydberg atoms interacting with a microwave field in a cavity ( as it has been done in @xcite ) or with thermal usual atoms interacting with a visible light .",
    "it has been theoretically and numerically shown in @xcite that hamiltonian semiclassical chaos may arise with cold atoms with recoil in a standing - wave microcavity .    in trying to describe adequately dynamics of single atoms and photons in a high - quality cavity",
    ", one should go beyond the semiclassical approximation and treats the atom - photon interaction on a quantum ground .",
    "the fully quantum model of the interaction between a single two - level atom ( without a recoil ) with a single - mode quantized field in an ideal cavity is known as the jaynes - cummings model @xcite .",
    "it describes the atom - field system as a quantum - electrodynamical object whose evolution in time is ( quasi)periodic . in schrdinger picture , it may be described by an infinite set of linear ordinary differential equations for the probability amplitudes to find the atom in the ground / excited state and the field in the state with @xmath0 photons , where @xmath0 runs from zero to infinity . when adopting the semiclassical approximation , we reduce , by hook or by crook , this infinite set to a small number of equations for atomic and field variables .",
    "in fact , we decouple the quantum atom - field system into an atom and field parts which may exchange excitations with each other . in doing so",
    ", we get automatically products of the atom and field variables in the equations of motion .",
    "the respective maxwell ",
    "bloch equations may , under appropriate conditions , produce chaos in the classical sense of sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the reduced classical phase space spanned by the atomic and field expectation values .",
    "it resembles the procedure of deriving the famous lorenz equations from an infinite hierarchy of mode equations in fluid convection by reducing it to three main modes only .",
    "the reduction of an infinite set of linear equations , that are not chaotic in the classical sense , to a finite set of nonlinear equations , that may be chaotic , makes an impression that it is only a mathematical trick .",
    "it seems that it is not only a useful trick enabling us to handle with the equations of motion but the reduction is a model of processes that may occur in nature . coherence loss caused by inevitable interaction with environment ( decoherence ) breaks quantum unitarity suppressing some quantum properties of motion and revealing its classical properties .",
    "such a situation can be modeled with the use of a quantum - classical hybrid , a system with quantum and classical degrees of freedom dynamically coupled to each other . which part of the whole system under consideration is quantized and which one is treated classically depends on the physical situation .",
    "if we have a large number of atoms ( or photons ) we may adopt with a good accuracy the semiclassical approximation treating the cavity field as a classical one .",
    "when considering a single atom with a recoil in a high - quality microcavity it is necessary to quantize the internal electronic atomic and field degrees of freedom but the translational atomic motion may be treated classically if the values of the atomic momentum are greater than the photon momentum .",
    "the interaction between matter and radiation , commonly evidenced by spontaneous emission and induced emission and absorption of photons by atoms , is one of the most fundamental dynamical interactions in nature . in free space",
    ", an excited atomic state decays irreversibly because an infinity of vacuum electromagnetic states is available to the radiated photons which disappears in the free - space mode continuum .",
    "the situation may be changes if the mode structure and the density of modes are modified by placing the radiating atom into a high - quality cavity .",
    "a cavity - induced enhancement and inhibition of spontaneous emission has been observed in a number of experiments in different ranges of the electromagnetic field , from microwaves to visible light ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in a near - resonant ideal cavity with a single - mode frequency closed to the atomic transitional frequency , the radiation emitted by the atom is reflected at the cavity walls and is reabsorbed by the atom many times before it dissipates . in",
    "particularly , spontaneous emission becomes reversible . in cavity quantum electrodynamics",
    "near - resonant interaction of a single atom with a single - mode cavity field is commonly modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the free motionless two - level atom with @xmath3 being the energy separation between the electronic states , the ground @xmath4 and excited @xmath5 ones .",
    "the pauli spin operator acts on the states as @xmath6 the hamiltonian @xmath7 represents the mode of the isolated field .",

    "the products @xmath21 and @xmath22 describe the transition of the atom from the ground ( excited ) to the excited ( ground ) state and simultaneous annihilating ( creating ) a photon in the field mode , respectively .",
    "they are usual energy - conserving processes .",
    "the product @xmath23 describes the transition of the atom from the ground to the excited state and simultaneous creating a photon in the mode .",
    "the reverse process of simultaneous atom and field de - excitation is described by the term @xmath24 .",
    "the last two processes are not energy - conserving and may be neglected while we deal with a single atom .",
    "omitting the energy - nonconserving terms defines the jaynes - cummings model @xcite which was proposed originally in 1963 as a purely theoretical tool for studying fundamentals of the interaction between matter and radiation .",
    "it seemed to be far from reality because neither the atom nor the cavity mode can hardly be perfectly isolated from environment with those - days technique .",
    "exciting progress in experimental techniques has drastically changed the situation .",
    "experiments , using very high - quality microwave cavities with @xmath25 and optical microcavities with @xmath26 , have now achieved the exceptional circumstance of strong coupling between atoms and a cavity field with the strength of the coupling exceeding the atomic and cavity decays that provides manipulations with single atoms and photons and experimental proving of some predictions of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite .",
