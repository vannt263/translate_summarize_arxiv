    "its axiom systems have been built  @xcite and generalization works have been done  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as is known , many optimization issues related to rough sets , including attribute reduction , are np - hard , and thus , typically require greedy algorithms . to find effective methods for solving these problems , rough sets have been combined with other theories  @xcite , especially matroid theory  @xcite , which borrows extensively from linear algebra and graph theory . with abundant theories and a perfect system ,",
    "matroid theory has been widely used in many fields including combinatorial optimization , network flows  @xcite , and algorithm design , especially greedy algorithm design  @xcite .",

    "a greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum .    in many problems ,",
    "a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution , but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time .",
    "the most wonderful thing is that the question whether a greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution for a particular problem can be converted to the question whether there exists a translation of the problem into a matroid .",
    "furthermore , the optimal solutions are bases of the matroid .",
    "there are two well - known optimization problems solved by greedy algorithms designed by matroids .",
    "one is the minimum - weight spanning tree problem , the other is job assignment problem .",
    "the solution for the former problem is a base of the corresponding graphic matroid , and the solution for the latter one is a base of the corresponding transversal matroid .",
    "this prompts us to establish relationships between the bases of a matroid and the attribute reduction .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a dependence space in the context of matroids and apply it to attribute reduction problems .",
    "first , a dependence space of matroids is proposed from the viewpoint of closure operator .",
    "second , we study the dependence space by means of matroids .",
    "it is interesting to find that the set of consistent sets and the set of reducts of the dependence space are the family of independent sets and the family of bases of the corresponding matroid , respectively .",
    "finally , matroids are studied conversely by dependence spaces and two expressions for bases of matroids are presented .",

    "<S> matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields , particularly greedy algorithm design , which plays an important role in attribute reduction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems . in this paper , we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids . </S>",
    "<S> first , a dependence space of matroids is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> second , the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases . in a word , </S>",
    "<S> this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction .    </S>",
