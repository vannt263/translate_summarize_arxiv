    "the binary pulsar psr  b1259@xmath063  is in a highly eccentric ( @xmath2 ) , 3.5-yr orbit around a 10th magnitude b2e star , ss 2883 , of radius @xmath3 ( johnston et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the system is unique because psr  b1259@xmath063  is the only radio pulsar orbiting a main - sequence companion with a circumstellar disk .",
    "observations of the h@xmath4 emission line show that optically emitting material in the be - star disk extends to at least @xmath5 ( johnston et al .",
    "1994 ) , and pulsar timing data suggest that the disk is steeply inclined to the plane of the binary orbit ( wex et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the pulsar s orbital radius at periastron is @xmath6 .",
    "melatos , johnston & melrose ( 1995 ) proposed a wind - disk model of the system to explain orbital variations of the flux density , polarisation , rotation measure and dispersion measure of the pulsed emission near periastron ( johnston et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the model ,",
    "the eclipse of the pulsed emission between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 denotes the epoch of periastron ) is attributed to free - free absorption in the disk .",
    "x - ray observations of psr  b1259@xmath063  reveal significant ( unpulsed ) emission throughout the orbit , with the flux density at periastron @xmath10 times higher than at apastron ( hirayama et al .  1996 ) .",
    "modeling suggests that the x - rays are synchrotron radiation from relativistic pulsar wind leptons accelerated at the shock between the pulsar wind and be - star outflow ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "we discuss the origin of the transient , unpulsed radio emission detected from psr  b1259@xmath063  from @xmath11 until @xmath12 ( johnston et al .",
    "the radio emission , like the x - rays , is likely to be synchrotron radiation produced by the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and be - star outflow .",
    "however , we argue that the interaction between the pulsar wind and an isotropic , radiatively driven , be - star wind can not explain the magnitude and rapidity of the variations in the radio light curve . furthermore , we show that the radio emitting electrons , unlike the x - ray electrons , do not originate from the pulsar wind .",
    "we therefore suggest that the unpulsed radio emission results from the acceleration of electrons in the be - star disk . the pulsar  disk encounter is likely to result in a strongly time - dependent ,",
    "magnetized , hydrodynamical interaction forming a cometary pulsar wind nebula surrounded by a shock front where acceleration of particles is followed by a combination of adiabatic , synchrotron and inverse compton cooling",
    ". however , the data so far obtained from this system are insufficient to constrain a model of the physics at this level of detail . here",
    "we propose a simple model for the radio light curves which reproduces the main features of the data and identifies the essential physics .",
    "two periastron passages of psr  b1259@xmath063  have been observed in detail , the first on 1994 jan 9 and the second on 1997 may 29 .",
    "unpulsed radio emission was detected at frequencies between 0.84 and 8.4  ghz , as described by johnston et al .",
    "figure 4 of that paper shows the radio light curve at five frequencies during the 1997 periastron passage ( the observed 1.4  ghz light curve is reproduced here in figure 1b ) .",
    "emission appeared suddenly at @xmath11 ; prior to this the 3-@xmath13 upper limit on the unpulsed emission is @xmath14 mjy at frequencies between 1.4 and 8.4  ghz . for the next few days , rapid variations were superimposed on an overall increase in the flux density @xmath15 at all frequencies , peaking at @xmath16  mjy at 1.4  ghz near @xmath17 .",
    "there followed a relatively slow decline before the flux density again began increasing around @xmath18 , peaking a second time near @xmath19 , with @xmath20  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the flux density then declined steeply until around @xmath21 , when the rate of decay slowed to roughly that observed after the first peak near @xmath17 .",
    "this slower decline continued until the last observations on @xmath22 .",
    "the 1994 data are similar and showed detectable emission until @xmath12 .    at most times the radio frequency spectrum is well fitted by a power law @xmath23 of spectral index @xmath24 , consistent with synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons .",
    "importantly , there is evidence in both the 1994 and 1997 data that the spectrum steepens after periastron ( figure 5 of johnston et al .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for free - free absorption at any epoch between @xmath11 and @xmath22 ( johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) , even at periastron when the pulsed emission is totally eclipsed by the be - star disk .",
    "the relativistic pulsar wind is enclosed within a bubble as it ploughs through the material around the be star .",
    "momentum flux balance between the pulsar wind and be - star outflow determines the size and shape of the bubble , and particles are shock accelerated at the boundary between the two flows ( melatos , johnston & melrose 1995 ) .",
    "the be - star outflow consists of a radiation - driven polar wind and a more dense equatorial disk responsible for the bulk of the mass loss ( dougherty 1994 ) .",
    "both components are often characterised as simple power laws in radial distance @xmath25 , with number density and speed given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to a constant speed and @xmath29 corresponds to constant ram pressure . if the outflow is highly conducting so that the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma , then simple models imply @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the polar wind is generally thought to reach a terminal speed @xmath32 within a few stellar radii ( e.g.  friend & mcgregor 1984 ) ; we therefore approximate it as a constant speed outflow with @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the disk density falls off rapidly with radius , as rotating material gradually accelerates outward ; one typically has @xmath34 , @xmath35 and a half opening angle of @xmath36 ( waters , cot & lamers 1987 ) .",
    "the disk and wind number densities are related by @xmath37 . for @xmath38",
    "this implies a density ratio of @xmath39 .",
    "typical values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 yield @xmath42 .",
    "if the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , @xmath43 , goes entirely into the relativistic wind then the ram pressure at a distance @xmath44 from the pulsar is @xmath45 .",
    "the ram pressure of the be - star polar wind is @xmath46 .",
    "the contact discontinuity between the two flows has its apex at the point where the ram pressures balance , provided the magnetic pressures can be ignored .",
    "this point is denoted by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the pulsar - be star separation , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the ratio of the momentum flux in the pulsar wind to that in the be - star polar wind .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 is constant over the pulsar orbit , although @xmath48 and @xmath52 both vary .",
    "now suppose that the unpulsed radio flux is associated with the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and be - star polar wind .",
    "synchrotron theory implies that the flux density scales as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number density of radiating electrons , @xmath55 is the source size and @xmath56 is the magnetic field . assuming @xmath57 and that the other source parameters scale as their values at the contact surface apex , one obtains @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , implying @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( irrespective of whether the radiating electrons originate from the pulsar wind or be - star polar wind ) .",
    "since @xmath48 varies by a factor of @xmath63 around the orbit , this argument implies that @xmath15 should be @xmath64 times higher at periastron than at apastron  consistent with the sparse x - ray data , but far smaller than the 1.4  ghz radio variation from @xmath65 at apastron to @xmath66 near periastron .",
    "furthermore , in the interval near periastron , the above scaling yields @xmath67  mjy , yet at @xmath68 there is no detectable unpulsed radio emission at any frequency .",
    "we conclude that the emission can not be attributed solely to the interaction between the pulsar wind and be - star polar wind .",
    "the pulsar orbit is eccentric and steeply inclined with respect to the be - star disk , so the pulsar wind interacts strongly with the disk near periastron , potentially generating unpulsed radio emission .",
    "we now investigate whether the radiating electrons in this scenario originate from the pulsar wind or the disk .",
    "the magnetic field in the emission region is the sum of the contribution from the pulsar , @xmath69  tesla ( estimated from @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the assumption @xmath72 in the pulsar wind ) , and the contribution from the be star .",
    "the field in the be - star polar wind satisfies @xmath73  tesla ( see barker 1987 for an upper limit on surface fields of be stars ) , while estimates of the field in the disk are so uncertain as to be of little value . for @xmath74 ,",
    "one finds @xmath75  t at @xmath76 when the radio peaks occur , and hence @xmath77 .",
    "this value of @xmath56 is consistent with that obtained independently from synchrotron equipartition arguments , which yield @xmath75  t for @xmath78 and @xmath62 , assuming a source distance of 1.5  kpc , a spherical source of radius @xmath79 .",
    "the lorentz factor required to produce synchrotron emission at 1  ghz in such a field is @xmath80  five orders of magnitude lower than the likely lorentz factor @xmath81 of unaccelerated leptons in the pulsar wind ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ; arons & gallant 1994 ) .",
    "we conclude that the pulsar - wind electrons are too energetic to be responsible for the unpulsed radio emission observed . on the other hand , non - relativistic electrons from the be - star disk and/or polar wind",
    "could certainly be accelerated to the relatively modest energy required at shock(s ) produced by the interaction between the pulsar wind and be - star disk ( e.g.  kirk 1994 ) as they are in binaries comprising early - type stars ( eichler & usov 1993 ) .      the number density of radiating electrons can be estimated straightforwardly for an assumed source size and magnetic field , since from synchrotron theory @xmath82 .",
    "the source size @xmath55 is at least the standoff distance @xmath52 , otherwise synchrotron self - absorption would cause a detectable low - frequency turnover below 1  ghz ( johnston et al .",
    "if the emission results from the interaction between the pulsar wind and be - star disk , then the source is likely to be some kind of sheath around the contact discontinuity , extending downstream in a cometary tail . a spherical sheath with thickness @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a numerical factor less than 1 , yields @xmath85 for the parameters used above .",
    "the number density of the pulsar wind can be estimated straightforwardly from the spindown luminosity @xmath86  w and wind lorentz factor @xmath81 , yielding @xmath87 and hence @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "this is at least 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated number density required to produce the observed radio flux density .",
    "while the estimates clearly allow considerable latitude , and a shock may compress the wind by a factor of order 10 , it is very difficult to argue away this discrepancy .",
    "we conclude that the pulsar - wind electrons are too few in number to be responsible for the unpulsed radio emission observed . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the number density of the be - star disk falls off as steeply as @xmath90 , one finds @xmath91 , and acceleration of just @xmath92 of the electrons in the disk can account for the observed emission .",
    "johnston et al .  ( 1999 ) and wex et al .  ( 1998 ) have argued that the be - star disk is inclined with respect to the orbital plane in such a way that the pulsar passes through the disk twice in each orbit , once before periastron ( crossing the disk around @xmath93 at @xmath94 ) and once afterwards ( @xmath95 at @xmath96 ) .",
    "we postulate that the radiating electrons are created during time intervals @xmath97 and @xmath98 at the two disk crossings , when the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and the disk ( and hence electron acceleration ) is at its peak , and nowhere else .",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 are somewhat greater than the orbital crossing time of the disk ( @xmath99 with @xmath100 according to johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) because the pulsar wind interacts appreciably with the disk surface for a few days before the pulsar enters and after it leaves .",
    "the two resulting electron populations are assumed to evolve with time purely under the action of synchrotron losses .",
    "the loss times at the two crossings are given in terms of constants @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the local magnetic field , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the number densities per unit energy @xmath105 then obey @xmath106 + q_{1,2}(\\varepsilon , t ) , \\label{eq : diffeqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 , the injection rate at each disk crossing , is a power law in energy during the times @xmath97 and @xmath98 and zero otherwise .",
    "note that the evolution of the accelerated electrons depends only on conditions at the acceleration site ; it is unrelated to the subsequent orbital position of the pulsar .",
    "emission from the first disk crossing persists as the pulsar rounds the be star ( behind the disk ) and is still present when the pulsar re - enters the disk after periastron , so the observed emission is the sum of that from the two electron populations .",
    "the lack of evidence of a low - frequency spectral turnover implies that there is little absorption of the unpulsed radio emission ( johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) , even when the pulsar is at periastron and is obscured behind the dense be - star disk .",
    "this strongly suggests that the radio - emitting electrons are left behind by the pulsar in a ram - pressure - confined bubble at the point where the pulsar crosses the disk , and that therefore their radio emission is not obscured by the bulk of the disk ( ball et al .",
    "we therefore ignore propagation effects on the radio emission .",
    "the proposed model does not include the effects of adiabatic expansion in the evolution of @xmath105 .",
    "melatos , johnston & melrose ( 1995 ) showed that when the pulsar is deep within the be - star disk , the momentum flux in the pulsar wind is insufficient to disrupt the disk and so the pulsar wind is contained within a bubble .",
    "it follows that in a model which assumes that the bubble of radiating electrons is spherical , the source does not expand and so adiabatic losses do not occur .",
    "electrons accelerated during each disk crossing are advected away from the shock apex in a cometary backflow ( melatos , johnston & melrose 1995 ) , but the observed rate of decline of the unpulsed radio emission indicates that the resulting adiabatic losses must occur on a timescale of a week or longer . in this letter we show that a model involving only injection during the pulsar disk crossings and synchrotron losses is in qualitative agreement with the observations .",
    "inverse compton losses may be important in this system ( tavani & arons 1997 ; kirk , ball & skjraasen 1999 ) . at the energies of the radio - emitting electrons",
    "these losses have the same form as synchrotron losses , and so the evolution of the electron spectrum will still be described by an equation of the form of ( [ eq : diffeqn ] ) . outside of the disk the energy density of target photons from the be",
    "star is comparable to the energy density in the magnetic field at the shock between the pulsar wind and the be - star wind ( kirk , ball & skjraasen 1999 ) , in which case the inverse compton and synchrotron loss rates would be comparable .",
    "however , the density of target photons available to radio - emitting electrons originating in the disk is likely to be low because of screening by the disk ( tavani & arons 1997 ) , and so inverse compton losses are likely to be less important than synchrotron losses in the model for the radio emission proposed here .    assuming that the synchrotron emissivity can be approximated by a delta - function in frequency , the observed emission at a given frequency @xmath108 originates from electrons with characteristic energies @xmath109 and @xmath110 at the two acceleration sites . since @xmath111 it follows that in general @xmath112 .",
    "the total number density per unit energy of electrons emitting characteristically at @xmath108 is then @xmath113 .",
    "when adiabatic losses ( and therefore expansion ) are neglected it follows from ( [ eq : synch ] ) that the that the emitted flux density is proportional to the number density of electrons radiating at @xmath108 .",
    "the solid line in figure 1a is the model flux density @xmath114 obtained in this way , plotted in arbitrary units as a function of time .",
    "the curve is obtained by solving equation ( [ eq : diffeqn ] ) for @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and source functions of the form @xmath118 ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows the model flux density for a frequency @xmath121 .",
    "since the pulsar is closer to the be star during the post - periastron disk crossing than during the pre - periastron crossing , ram pressure balance implies @xmath122 ; however , the choice @xmath123 @xmath124 in figure 1a is purely illustrative because we have no precise knowledge of the geometry of the pulsar - disk interaction .",
    "the synchrotron - loss times @xmath125 are roughly the values expected for @xmath126 and @xmath127 ; the injection intervals @xmath128 are roughly twice the pulsar disk crossing times ; the relative magnitudes of @xmath129 and @xmath130 are chosen arbitrarily to be similar .",
    "the curves are approximately piecewise - linear , a characteristic of solutions to equation ( [ eq : diffeqn ] ) for @xmath131 .",
    "the proposed model reproduces many of the essential features of the light curves in figure 4 of johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , from which the 1.4  ghz light curve is reproduced in figure 1b . in particular , the flux density is higher after @xmath132 because it is the sum of the contributions from two accelerated electron populations .",
    "the following features of the light curves in figures 1a and 1b should be noted .",
    "( i ) the first rise is associated with the pre - periastron disk crossing and lasts for a time @xmath97 , because the synchrotron - loss time @xmath133 is much greater than @xmath97 .",
    "( ii ) the gradual decay after @xmath17 , which continues until @xmath134 ( solid curve ) , occurs because the number of electrons per unit time cooling down to energy @xmath109 from @xmath135 is slightly smaller than the number with energy @xmath109 cooling to lower energies .",
    "( exact balance occurs for @xmath136 . )",
    "( iii ) the second rise is associated with the post - periastron disk crossing and lasts for the synchrotron - loss time @xmath137 , because @xmath98 is larger than @xmath137 .",
    "( iv ) the plateau at the principal maximum lasts for a time @xmath138 , which is brief because the injection and loss times for the post - periastron disk crossing have been chosen to be almost equal .",
    "( ii ) ] ( v ) following this brief plateau , @xmath139 decreases to zero over a time @xmath137 equal to the rise time in ( iii ) .",
    "since @xmath139 decreases to zero relatively rapidly , its contribution drops below that of the more slowly decaying @xmath140 and the subsequent evolution is therefore an extension of ( ii ) .",
    "note that the pre - periastron rise time ( i ) is determined by injection ( which lasts longer than the loss time ) , whereas the post - periastron rise time ( iii ) is determined by the loss time ( which is shorter than the second injection episode ) .",
    "these rise times happen to be similar because we chose parameters such that @xmath141 .",
    "the changing separation of the solid and dashed curves in figure 1a indicates that the effective spectral index @xmath142 of the composite electron distribution is not constant . by crudely relating @xmath142 to @xmath4 ( @xmath23 ) via @xmath143 ,",
    "we predict that the spectrum : ( i ) has @xmath144 and does not change significantly from switch - on at @xmath93 until the short plateau around @xmath145 ; ( ii ) then steepens markedly with @xmath4 increasing to @xmath146 before flattening again to @xmath147 at @xmath21 ; ( iii ) steepens smoothly thereafter as the emission at higher frequencies decays more rapidly .",
    "the model behavior is broadly in accord with the data , which reveal a systematic steepening of the spectrum with the spectral index changing by @xmath148 between @xmath149 and @xmath21 ( figure 5 of johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) , followed by a less pronounced flattening .",
    "the model makes a clear , testable prediction .",
    "we see from figure 1a that the slow decay after the first disk crossing ( which continues well past the second disk crossing to the end of the observation period @xmath22 ) ends sharply ; the model flux density decreases to zero over a time comparable to the initial rise , @xmath150 , instead of maintaining its very gradual downward slope all the way to zero .",
    "although observations extending to @xmath12 were made at 0.84  ghz following the 1994 periastron , these single - frequency data are inconclusive as to the existence of such a feature",
    ". it will be possible to test this prediction during the next periastron passage ; the frequency dependence of the onset of this rapid decline should also be observable .",
    "the model makes no attempt to explain the shortest time scale variations in the radio emission .",
    "particularly puzzling is the flat spectrum ` blip ' which was observed at @xmath151 in 1997 .",
    "we speculate that this feature is the result of the pulsar nebula splashing into the be - star disk .",
    "such effects are more likely to have observable consequences the first time the pulsar enters the disk because the system geometry is such that we have an unobscured view of the pre - periastron impact ( see figure 6 of johnston et al .",
    "1999 ) , but not of the post - periastron impact .",
    "we have argued that the transient , unpulsed radio emission from the binary system psr  b1259@xmath063is synchrotron emission associated with the shock interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind and the dense circumstellar disk of the be star .",
    "the radiating electrons originate from the disk , not a spherically - symmetric pulsar wind with the parameters required to model the x - ray data .",
    "we have presented a simple physical model for the evolution of the unpulsed radio emission , based on impulsive acceleration of electrons followed by synchrotron losses , which reproduces the salient features of the radio light curves and spectra observed during the 1994 and 1997 periastron passages .",
    "the model also makes a testable prediction of a rapid frequency - dependent decay in the radio flux several weeks after the principal flux density peak , to be searched for during observations of the next periastron passage in october 2000 .",
