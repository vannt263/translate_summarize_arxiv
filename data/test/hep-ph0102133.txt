    "so far we discussed small , but finite , bjorken @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath123 and the integral thereof . at least from the theoretical point of view",
    ", one can ask the question : what happens to @xmath146 when @xmath147 ?",
    "our analysis seems to suggest that the gottfried integral for the @xmath1he-@xmath1h system is divergent logarithmically because of the non - cancellation of the factor @xmath148 .",
    "we observe that this result is not paradoxical since the gottfried integral is not constrained by current algebra  as , for example , the bjorken sum rule .",
    "thus , the value of the gottfried integral is not related to any physical observable or constant and , in principle , can be infinite .",
    "our statement that @xmath149 diverges is supported by the analysis of the total virtual photon - nucleus cross section ( structure function @xmath119 ) at small values of bjorken @xmath2 within the gribov model @xcite . indeed ,",

    "hadrons _ '' ) ; @xmath155 is the photon - target cross section for the production of the final state with mass squared @xmath154 .",
    "the key assumption of the model is that when @xmath38 is constant , @xmath2 is very small and @xmath156 ( very heavy nuclear target ) , the hadronic fluctuations of the virtual photon @xmath28 ( see eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) ) interact with the nucleus with the maximal possible cross section @xmath157 ( @xmath158 is the size of the nucleus ) @xcite .",
    "this set of approximations is sometimes called the black body limit .",

    "@xcite that @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the critical bjorken @xmath164 entering the dipole formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , when the black body limit is achieved .",
    "the factor @xmath163 depends on the details of a particular dipole model and , in general , significantly affects the absolute value of @xmath119 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ disp2 ] ) . since we are concerned with qualitative and model - independent aspects of the @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath136 following from eq .",
    "( [ disp2 ] ) , after taking the integral over the diffractive masses in eq .",
    "( [ disp2 ] ) , we can present the nuclear structure function in the form @xmath165    the application of the black body limit as @xmath147 is also justified for light nuclei and nucleons . in particular , using eq .",
    "( [ disp3 ] ) , one obtains for the difference of the structure functions of @xmath1he and @xmath1h : @xmath166 the charge symmetry breaking in the @xmath1he-@xmath1h system manifests itself as the non - equality of charge and , hence , nuclear matter radii of @xmath1he ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath1h ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) into the gottfried integral yields an integral , divergent as @xmath169 as @xmath147 . hence , we conclude that our analysis of nuclear shadowing and the one within the framework of the black body approximation shows that the gottfried integral for the @xmath1he-@xmath1h system is divergent .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above discussed phenomena should also be relevant for the free proton and neutron . in this case , similarly to the tri - nucleon system , small charge symmetry breaking makes the ( hadronic ) sizes of the proton and neutron different .",
    "specifically , two effects work in the direction of making the radius of the proton larger than the radius of the neutron .",
    "these are the coulomb repulsion and the quark mass difference .",
    "( since the neutron consists of two @xmath13 quarks and one @xmath12 quark and the @xmath13 quark is heavier than the @xmath12 , the size of the neutron is smaller than that of the proton consisting of two @xmath12 quarks and one @xmath13 quark . )",
    "the difference in sizes should lead to different photoabsorption cross sections on the proton and neutron .",
    "the analysis of ( virtual ) photon - hadron interactions demonstrated that in order to successfully describe the data , the photon should contain `` soft '' and `` hard '' contributions .",
    "the soft part interacts with the target with some typical hadronic cross section .",
    "phenomenologically , cross sections of soft interactions are proportional to the square of the radius of the target hadron ",
    "see e.g. ref .  @xcite . in light of the argument presented above for the size of the valence quark distributions in the proton and neutron ,",
    "the soft component of the photon should interact with the proton with a larger cross section .",
    "one can expect a similar effect for the hard component of the photon .",
    "the hard cross section is proportional to the gluon field of the target with a cutoff proportional to the size of the target .",
    "this makes the cross section for interaction with the proton larger than that with the neutron .",
    "hence , in the limit of very small values of bjorken @xmath2 , the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton is larger than on the neutron . in other words",
    ", we expect that @xmath170 should be greater than @xmath171 , which would lead to the divergence of the gottfried integral , @xmath172 .",
    "further investigations of this interesting question are necessary . if , indeed , @xmath172 is infinite , modern parton distributions need to be revised since they impose the condition @xmath173 as @xmath174 and , hence , give a finite value of @xmath172 .",
    "we considered the influence of the nuclear effects of shadowing and antishadowing on the structure functions @xmath98 of @xmath1he and @xmath99 of @xmath1h .",
    "we found that these nuclear effects increase the gottfried integral @xmath141 by @xmath4% , depending on the model used for the nuclear wave functions and for the calculation of nuclear shadowing .",
    "we observed that the violation of charge symmetry for the nuclear wave functions of @xmath1he and @xmath1h induces charge symmetry breaking for the nuclear quark parton densities ( as a result of the nuclear shadowing correction ) .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the gottfried integral , integrated over the whole region of bjorken @xmath2 , @xmath149 , is divergent .",
    "it is expected that even in the case of the free nucleon , the hadronic sizes of the proton and neutron should be different because of the small charge symmetry breaking effect .",
    "this suggests that the gottfried integral of the free nucleon should be divergent at very small @xmath2",
    ". it will be very interesting to study the gottfried integral of the free nucleon at very small @xmath2 in the future .",
    "experiments on dis off mirror nuclei with large isospin asymmetry should be possible in the future @xcite .",
    "the observation of some deviation from the present calculations would provide information on phenomena involving non - pqcd dynamics ( like the pion fields ) in a nuclear medium .",
    "if one could vary the atomic number ( @xmath26 ) and the difference between the proton and neutron numbers ( @xmath175 ) independently in measuring the nuclear structure functions of unstable mirror nuclei @xcite , it would stimulate a great deal of work which may eventually lead to genuinely new information on the dynamics of nuclear systems .",
