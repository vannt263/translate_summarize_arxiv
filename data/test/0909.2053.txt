    "does the tidal debris of minor mergers contribute structures to halos of spiral galaxies or igm ?",
    "though major mergers are known to create structures from star clusters to tidal dwarf galaxies in their debris @xcite , less is known about minor mergers and their tidal debris . yet , minor mergers are more common and were presumably important in the early universe .",
    "structures in minor mergers tidal debris may be captured by the more massive galaxy and create structures in the galaxy s halo like those found in the milky way @xcite , or contribute to the pollution of the igm .",
    "tidal debris can also give insight into unusual environments of star formation and how gas behaves in galaxy interactions .",
    "studying the formation of structure in the tidal debris of minor mergers can help us understand a common process in galaxy formation , particularly disk and halo formation .",
    "compared to major mergers , less is known about minor mergers ( mass ratios between a dwarf galaxy and a disk galaxy of less than 0.3 ) and their tidal debris .",
    "previous work includes vlt observations of ngc 6872 @xcite and hst observations of ugc 10214 @xcite .",
    "these studies found the tidal debris to contain blue star clusters ( @xmath1 ; bastian et al .",
    "2005 and @xmath2 ; de grijs et al .",
    "2003 ) with young ages indicating they were formed within the tidal tail(s ) .",
    "using the 1.8 m vatt , deep optical images of 15 minor mergers were taken in @xmath3 and narrow - band @xmath0 and reduced using standard iraf tasks .",
    "point sources were found using daofind .",
    "final star cluster candidates were selected using the 3def code @xcite and bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ssp models with a metallicity of @xmath4 .",
    "these sed fits gave an age , mass , and extinction for each star cluster candidate .",
    "results from the closest six out of the full sample of 15 minor mergers show that star clusters in the tidal debris have ages ranging from a few myr to greater than a gyr as well as masses ranging @xmath5 ( figure 1 )",
    ". there may be some contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "table 1 shows properties of the minor mergers such as merger stage , as well as the dynamical age of the tail , number of star cluster candidates ( scc ) , mean or median values of @xmath6 , age , mass , and extinction , and the total mass of the star cluster candidates in the tidal debris area .    in each merger",
    ", there are scc with ages less than the tail age , which indicates that the star cluster formed in the tidal debris and was not pulled out from the central regions of the galaxies . comparing the merger stages with age ,",
    "early stage mergers have slightly younger median ages than late stage or merged systems , with the exception of ugc 260 .",
    "the median age of clusters in this system are likely skewed by the presence of substantial @xmath0 flux contaminating the clusters . in general",
    ", the median cluster age appears to be 10 - 20% of the dynamical age of the merger .",
    "the lowest median mass of the star clusters are found in the early stage mergers of arp 269 and arp 279 .",
    "these two galaxies appear to be missing higher mass star clusters .",
    "this could indicate either that they have not yet formed more massive star clusters or that there is not enough material in their tails to form them .",
