    "grbs are known to emit radiation up to the detector sensitivity limits of grb satellites .",
    "photons at energies @xmath010  gev have been detected so far  @xcite , without any sign of apparent cutoffs in the energy spectrum .",
    "gamma - rays of even higher energy would allow for valuable insights in the secondary emission processes : inverse compton ( ic ) and/or hadronic emission scenarios which lead to a clearer picture of the circumburst medium and general energetics involved in the prompt emission phase . whereas current satellite experiments are rather limited by their effective areas when it comes to energies in the gev regime , the current generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , deploys full sensitivities only above typically 200  gev . at these energies , @xmath1-ray emitting sources have to lie at small redshifts to be detectable , given the absorption of @xmath1-rays by the extragalactic background lights ( ebl ) .",
    "grbs are located at redshifts typically around or higher than a redshift of @xmath2 , making it mandatory to lower the energy threshold of iactss to energies well below 100  gev .",
    "this goal was recently achieved by the magic collaboration using an upgraded sum trigger system and demonstrated with the observation of the crab pulsar at 25  gev  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the new trigger system is also used for most grb observations carried out with the magic telescope . among these observations , grb090102 stakes",
    "out by the fact that it could be observed under particularly low zenith angles allowing for the lowest possible thresholds .",
    "grb090102 was detected by the _ swift _ satellite on january 1@xmath3 , 2009 at 02:55:45ut  @xcite and also by the konus - wind satellite at 02:55:36ut  @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission lasted for about 30s , an x - ray and an optical counterpart were discovered and followed - up by several groups .",
    "spectroscopy was carried out allowing to derive a redshift of @xmath4  @xcite . using this redshift , konus - wind derived an isotropic energy release of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the bright multi - wavelength emission and good observational conditions for the swift instruments made that the swift collaboration declared grb090102 as `` burst of interest '' .",
    "the magic - i telescope started observation at 03:14:52  ut , 1161  s after the onset of the burst , but well after the prompt emission phase .",
    "observations were carried out under excellent observation conditions and at a very low zenith angle , ensuring a low energy threshold . the observation with magic - i started at a zenith angle of z@xmath6 , reaching z@xmath7 after 13149  s of observation .",
    "one night later , extensive off data were collected under the same observational conditions .",
    "off data are taken with the telescope pointing close to the original source location , without the source having in its field - of - view and are used to estimate the background from hadronic cosmic rays triggers .",
    "no significant excess of @xmath1-rays above background was detected .",
    "upper limits above 80  gev have already been reported elsewhere  @xcite , while we concentrate here on the analysis of the very low - energy part of the data .",
    "as the trigger energy threshold depends very sensitively on the telescope zenith angle , only data with z@xmath8 were used here , ensuring an analysis threshold around 30  gev ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these data cover 5919  s of observation time .",
    "differential upper limits with 95% cl for six energies were derived as shown in table  [ uls ] .",
    "these limits include a 30% systematic uncertainty on the overall telescope efficiency .",
    "xrt data show at the time of the magic observation an average ( unabsorbed ) flux of @xmath9 in the 0.3 to 10  kev energy regime , the time averaged spectrum yields a spectral photon index of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a simple extrapolation to the energies accessible by magic , made only for illustrative reasons , gives fluxes ranging from @xmath11 for our lowest energy bin from 25 to 50  gev . under the assumptions of a similar burst environment ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , an ssc scenario ,",
    "like the one shown in  @xcite , predicts a flux of about @xmath15 at 45  gev and @xmath16 , which is not far from the upper limit shown in the first energy bin , seen in table  [ uls ] .",
    "note that this burst is much less studied than grb080430 , and therefore all assumptions on the circumburst medium , magnetic energy density , etc .",
    "are only rudimentary , and variations of these parameters may modify the result considerably .",
    ".upper limits for the emission of grb090102 , corresponding to @xmath17 of the magic - i observation from 03:14:52  ut to 04:53:32  ut . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     this simplistic treatment does not take into account higher orders of ic scattering of x - ray photons and/or hadronic emission processes since some of the necessary parameters are not available for this burst .",
    "one can see a recent review of possible scenarios in  @xcite and an example for the case of grb080430 , compared to magic upper limits , in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "different models predict a wide range of optical depths at @xmath18 , ranging from about 1 up to 6  @xcite .",
    "recently , the magic collaboration published an observational result  @xcite suggesting the ebl attenuation could be much lower than previously assumed .",
    "a quasar located at a redshift of @xmath19 could be clearly detected at energies well above 150  gev , opening such the window to the universe observable by iacts .",
    "this means that at the redshift of grb090102 , @xmath20 , and at the magic-1 threshold energy , e @xmath21gev , an optical depth , @xmath22 , not far from unity is possible .",
    "these statements are strengthened by the discovery of a @xmath010  gev emission component by lat detector onboard the fermi satellite , from a burst with much higher redshift  @xcite . in total , even after taking into account a possible attenuation of a factor 10 to 100 , our limits start to be sensitive to possible ic emission components of grbs .",
    "excess event rates vs. observation time in bins of 10 minutes are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] for the three lowest energy bins .",
    "the entries fluctuate around zero and are all compatible with fluctuations of the background from hadronic cosmic rays triggers .",
    "unfortunately , this burst did not show any x - ray flare during the early afterglow which would otherwise allow for correlation studies between the x - ray and vhe @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "the magic-1 telescope has undergone several hardware upgrades  @xcite during the last year , which significantly enhance the chances to detect the @xmath010  gev @xmath1-ray emission component of grbs .",
    "grb090102 was the first grb afterglow observation made with the new sum trigger , under excellent observation conditions , which allowed to derive upper limits well below 50  gev .",
    "sensitivity for @xmath1-ray emission at these low energies is a prerequisite to detect emission from bursts at moderate and high redshifts .",
    "although in the case of grb090102 , our limits are still compatible with a general ssc model under very rude assumptions , a slightly closer and better studied burst should soon allow for the detection of a gev counterpart , in the best case in a joint observation together with lat .",
    "the collaboration thanks the instituto de astrofsica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma , as well as the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn and spanish mcinn .",
    "this work was also supported by eth research grant th 34/043 , by the polish mniszw grant n n203 390834 , and by the yip of the helmholtz gemeinschaft .",
