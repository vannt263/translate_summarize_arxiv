    "the description of quark dynamics inside hadrons remains an actual problem of elementary particle theory .",
    "the asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) enables one to investigate the quark interactions at small distances by making use of standard perturbation theory .",
    "the quark dynamics at large distances ( the confinement region ) lies beyond such calculations . for this purpose",
    "other approaches are used : phenomenological potential models @xcite , string models @xcite , bags models @xcite , lattice calculations @xcite , the explicit account of nontrivial qcd vacuum structure  @xcite , and variational perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "recently shirkov and solovtsov proposed a new analytic approach to qcd @xcite .",
    "its basic idea is the explicit imposition of the causality condition , which implies the requirement of the analyticity in the @xmath0 variable for the relevant physical quantities .",
    "the essential merits of this approach are the following : absence of unphysical singularities at any loop level , stability in the infrared ( ir ) region , stability with respect to loop corrections , and extremely weak scheme dependence .",
    "the analytic approach has been applied successfully to such problems as the @xmath1 lepton decays , @xmath2-annihilation into hadrons , sum rules ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the analytic approach has been employed to the solution of the renormalization group ( rg ) equation .",
    "the analyticity requirement was imposed on the rg equation itself , before deriving its solution . solving the rg equation , `` analytized '' ( i.e. , requiring analyticity ) in the above - mentioned way , one gets , at one - loop level , a new analytic running coupling , which possesses practically the same appealing features as the shirkov - solovtsov running coupling @xcite does .",
    "an essential distinction , that will play a crucial role in the present paper , is the ir singularity of the new analytic running coupling at the point @xmath3 .",
    "it should be stressed here that such a behavior of the invariant charge is in a complete agreement with the schwinger - dyson equations , and , as it will be demonstrated in sec .",
    "iii , provides the quark confinement ( see sec .",
    "ii for the details ) .    in this paper we shall adhere to the model @xcite of obtaining the quark - antiquark ( @xmath4 ) potential by the fourier transformation of the running coupling .",
    "however , the perturbative running coupling @xmath5 does not enable one to obtain the rising @xmath4 potential without invoking additional assumptions @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct the quark - antiquark potential by making use of the new analytic running coupling .",
    "this potential proves to be rising at large distances ( i.e. , providing the quark confinement ) and , at the same time , it incorporates the asymptotic freedom at small distances .",
    "it is essential that for obtaining this potential _ no additional assumptions _ , lying beyond the standard rg method in the quantum field theory and the analyticity requirement , will be used .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the derivation of the new analytic running coupling is presented and its properties are briefly discussed . in sec .",
    "iii the quark - antiquark potential , generated by the new analytic running coupling , is derived by making use of the fourier transformation .",
    "further , the asymptotic behavior of the potential at large and small distances is investigated . in sec .  iv the higher loop corrections and the scheme dependence of the potential are discussed briefly . for practical purposes , a simple approximate formula for the potential",
    "is proposed which interpolates its infrared and ultraviolet asymptotics .",
    "this formula is compared with the phenomenological cornell potential .",
    "proceeding from this , an estimation of the qcd parameter @xmath6 is obtained . in the conclusion ( sec .",
    "v ) the obtained results are formulated in a compact way , and the further studies in this approach are outlined .",
    "in the analytic approach to qcd , proposed by shirkov and solovtsov @xcite , the basic idea is the explicit imposing of the causality condition , which implies the requirement of the analyticity in the @xmath0 variable for the relevant physical quantities .",
    "later this idea was applied to the `` analytization '' ( i.e. , the procedure of analyticity requirement ) of the perturbative series when calculating the qcd observables @xcite .",
    "the results turned out to be quite encouraging . as was mentioned in the introduction , the analytization of the perturbative series leads to the elimination of the unphysical singularities , to the higher loop correction stability and to a weak scheme dependence .",
    "however , the @xmath0-evolution of some qcd observables ( for instance , the structure function moments ) is intimately tied with the solution of the rg equation .",
    "our task here is to involve the analytization procedure into the rg formalism more profoundly .",
    "let us consider the rg equation of a quite general form for a quantity @xmath7 ( it may be , for example , the gluon propagator , or the structure function moment ) .",
    "at the one - loop level this equation reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the corresponding anomalous dimension ( the negative noninteger number in the general case ) , @xmath10 is the one - loop perturbative running coupling .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ stdrgeqn ] ) can be written in the form @xmath11^{\\gamma}.\\ ] ] from here it follows immediately , that this solution has unphysical singularities in the physical region @xmath12 . however , in many interesting cases mentioned above , the quantity @xmath7 must have correct analytic properties in the @xmath0 variable ( namely , there is the only cutoff @xmath13 ) .",
    "one can demonstrate this proceeding from the first principles .",
    "so , for the gluon propagator this assertion follows from the causal klln - lehmann representation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and for the structure function moments this is a consequence of the deser - gilbert - sudarshan integral representation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we come to a contradiction .",
    "the point , which is crucial to our consideration , is the following .",
    "the rg equation in the form ( [ stdrgeqn ] ) involves , in fact , a contradiction .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation has no unphysical singularities in the @xmath12 region , while its right - hand side has pole - type singularity at the point @xmath14 .",
    "the account of the higher loop contributions just introduces the additional unphysical singularities of the cut type in the physical region @xmath12 and hence does not solve the problem .    in order to avoid this contradiction",
    ", we propose to use the following method @xcite . before solving the rg equation ( [ stdrgeqn ] )",
    "one should analytize its right - hand side as a whole .",
    "this prescription leads to the analytized rg equation , which , at the one - loop level , takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the perturbative running coupling analytized by making use of the shirkov - solovtsov prescription @xcite .- function for the invariant charge . ]",
    "the solution of eq.([argeqn ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath17^{\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 comparing the solution ( [ argeqnsol ] ) with eq.([stdrgeqnsol ] ) one infers that @xmath19 should be treated as a new one - loop analytic running coupling .",
    "really , it possesses the same properties , as the one - loop running coupling analytized through the shirkov - solovtsov procedure .",
    "namely , the new running coupling has the standard asymptotic behavior at @xmath20 and it has no unphysical singularities in the @xmath12 region .",
    "the latter follows directly from the causal representation of the klln - lehmann type , that holds for @xmath21 : @xmath22    the distinctive feature of the new running coupling , which will play the crucial role in the framework of our consideration , is its singularity at the point @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth noting that such a behavior of the invariant charge is in a complete agreement with the schwinger - dyson equations ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and , as it will be demonstrated in the next section , provides the quark confinement .    summarizing all stated above , we propose the following model for the analytic running coupling .",
    "we define the new analytic running coupling @xmath24 as the solution of the analytized rg equation at the respective loop level . here",
    "one has to choose the anomalous dimensions in such a way that the solution of the standard rg equation is the perturbative running coupling at the loop level considered . ; @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the coefficient by the @xmath27th power of the perturbative running coupling on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ stdrgeqn ] ) . ]",
    "thus , at the one - loop level , the new analytic running coupling has the form @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the first coefficient of the @xmath30-function . at the higher loop levels",

    "shows the new analytic running coupling computed at the one- , two- , and three - loop levels .",
    "it is clear from this figure that our analytic running coupling possesses the higher loop stability .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the singularity of the new analytic running coupling at the point @xmath23 is of the universal type at any loop level .",
    "this is clear from the following simple consideration . when @xmath35 the basic contribution into eq.([narcdefhl ] ) affords the integration over the small @xmath36 region .",
    "the spectral density @xmath37 at any loop level has the same limit when @xmath38 : @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "hence the new analytic running coupling ( [ narcdefhl ] ) has the unique behavior when @xmath35 .",
