    "recently , localization systems have found widespread application , since they allow to develop a number of new services in both outdoor and indoor environments @xcite . conventional localization systems",

    "localization accuracy can certainly benefit from the availability of any form of _ a priori _ knowledge . in the technical literature ,",
    "the sources of prior knowledge commonly exploited are represented by the positions of some specific nodes ( called _ anchors _ ) or by some characteristic of the communication channel ; for instance in @xcite the impact of different factors ( like non - line - of - sight , nlos , propagation and network synchronization ) on localization accuracy have been thoroughly analysed employing cramer - rao bounds ( crbs ) and , when a priori knowledge is available , bayesian cramer - rao bounds ( bcrbs ) . in @xcite multipath propagation in ultra wide band ( uwb ) systems and its effects on time - of - arrival ( toa ) estimation",
    "have been investigated by means of crbs or bcrbs . in @xcite crbs and bcrbs for the analysis of cooperative localization techniques",
    "have been derived .    in recent times , however , some attention has been paid to the possibility of improving accuracy by endowing localization systems with _ map - awareness _ ,",
    "i.e. , with the knowledge of the _ map _ of the environment in which they operate . specific examples of map - aware algorithms have been developed in @xcite , which propose the adoption of non - linear filtering techniques ( namely , particle filtering and extended kalman filtering ) to embed map - based a priori information in navigation systems .",
    "this work evidences that this kind of information plays an important role in improving localization and navigation accuracy ; however , the impact of map - awareness on the performance limits of localization systems is still an open problem .",
    "in fact , as far as we know , the technical literature dealing with the fundamental limits of localization accuracy @xcite has not considered this issue yet .    in this",
    "paper , novel accuracy bounds for map - aware localization systems are developed and their applications to specific environments are analysed .",
    "specifically , the bcrb , the extended zik - zakai bound ( ezzb ) and the weiss - weinstein bound ( wwb ) for the above mentioned systems are derived .",
    "these bounds , which provide several novel insights into map - aware localization , have the following features :    1 .",
    "they are characterized by different tightness / analytical complexity ; 2 .",
    "they can be evaluated for any map geometry and , in the cases of the bcrb and the ezzb , admit a closed form for rectangular maps ; 3 .",
    "they allow to a ) identify map features ( e.g. , shape , area , etc . )",
    "influencing localization accuracy and b ) quantify such an influence .",
    "then , such bounds are evaluated and compared for simple representative environments .",
    "our results allow to assess the importance of map - awareness in localization systems in the presence of noisy observations .",
    "in particular , they evidence that :    1 .",
    "maps should be expected to play a significant role at low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) and in the presence of obstructions ; 2 .   in some cases",
    "simplified map models can be adopted for localization purposes , since map details have a negligible impact on estimation accuracy .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : scenario ] our reference scenario is illustrated and the map model is defined .",

    "in the following we focus on the problem of localizing a single device , called _ agent _ , in a 2-d environment , i.e. , of estimating its position @xmath19^{t}$ ] , in the presence of the following information : a ) a map representing the a priori knowledge about the environment in which the localization system operates ; b ) an observation vector @xmath20 related to the true position @xmath21 of the agent .      in a bayesian framework the map of a given environment can be modelled for localization purposes as a pdf @xmath22 of the random variable @xmath21 , representing the agent position .",
    "such a pdf is characterized by a 2-d support @xmath23 having a finite size and consisting of the set of points in the environment not occupied by obstructions ( e.g. , walls , buildings , etc ) . in the absence of other prior knowledge ,",
    "a natural choice for @xmath22 is a simple uniform model , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the area of @xmath23 .",
    "this model is referred to as _ uniform map _ in the following and is preferable to other , more detailed , prior models since it can be adopted when only basic knowledge of the environment is available ( e.g. , the floor plan of a building in indoor environments or satellite photos in outdoor environments ) . an alternative statistical model for maps , better suited to mathematical analysis in the bcrb case , is a `` smoothed '' version of ( [ eq : uniform_map ] ) ; this is obtained modifying the uniform pdf in a narrow area around the edges of @xmath23 in order to introduce a smooth transition to zero along the boundaries of its support .",
    "note that the adoption of a smoothed uniform model leads to analytical results similar to those found with the uniform model if the transition region is small with respect to the size of @xmath23 .",
    "as it will become clearer in the following , for a generic map , a detailed description of the structure of its support @xmath23 should be provided to ease the formulation of the accuracy bounds referring to the map itself .",

    "[ fig : non_convex_generic_shape ] .      in the following ,",
    "we assume that the localization system is able to acquire a set of noisy observations , collected in a vector @xmath20 and related to the agent position @xmath21 according to a specific statistical model .",

    "it is important to point out that :    1 .   the model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) is purposely abstract and does not explicitly refer to a specific localization technique ( e.g. , toa or received signal strength ( rss ) ) or to particular propagation conditions . generally speaking ,",
    "it is suitable to describe the position estimate @xmath20 generated by a map - unaware and unbiased localization algorithm ; in addition , it leads to useful bounds which unveil the impact of _ map _ modelling ( instead of that of _ observation _ modelling ) on estimation performance ; readers interested in an in - depth analysis on the impact of observation modelling can refer to @xcite .",

    "in this section various bounds about the accuracy of map - aware position estimation are derived and their implications are analysed .",
    "given an estimator @xmath63 of @xmath21 based on the observation vector @xmath20 , the bcrb establishes that the bayesian mean square error ( bmse ) matrix @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 is the bayesian fisher information matrix ( bfim ) associated to the statistical models employed by @xmath63 .",

    "the last decomposition allows us to analyse the two above mentioned sources of information in a separate fashion .",
    "therefore , in the following , we mainly focus on the evaluation of the matrix @xmath75 ( [ eq : bfim_apriori ] ) , since this term unveils the contribution of map information in the estimation of agent position . as already mentioned in sec .",

    "the computation of the bcrb requires the knowledge of @xmath82 ( [ eq : bfim_cond ] ) ( see ( [ eq : j_somma ] ) ) ; for its evaluation , instead of considering a specific observation model , we just assume that the cross - information about @xmath29 and @xmath30 is negligible , so that such a matrix can be put in the form if the specific observation model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) is adopted ; this result will be exploited later for comparison with other bounds derived for the model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath83 then , the bcrb associated with the pdf @xmath22 can be put in the form ( see ( [ eq : bfim_map_generic_mult_intervals ] ) , ( [ eq : jzp ] ) and ( [ eq : j_somma ] ) ) @xmath84 it can be shown that the last two expressions are exact , and can be put in a closed form ( not involving any integral ) , if @xmath23 is the union of a set of disjoint rectangles ( all having parallel sides ) .    from ( [ eq : bfim_map_generic_mult_intervals ] ) and ( [ eq : bcrb_generic ] ) it can be inferred that :    1 .",

    "its formulation is obtained from the standard formulation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 32 ) ) ) removing the so - called valley - filling function and the maximization operator , as shown in appendix [ apd : proofs_zzb ] ; these modifications simplify the derivation of the bound at the price of a small reduction in its tightness ; 2 .",
    "it exhibits a complicated dependence on the observation model , which comes into play in the evaluation of the probability @xmath128 ; 3 .",
    "it can not be put in a form similar to ( [ eq : j_somma ] ) , so that , generally speaking , the contribution coming from conditional information ( i.e. , observations ) can not be easily separated from that associated with a priori information ( map awareness in this case ) .",
    "as shown in appendix [ apd : proofs_zzb ] , for a uniform map and the observation model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_def ] ) can be put in the form ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) shown at the top of this page where    @xmath129    @xmath130    an accurate analysis of the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) and a comparison with the bcrb ( [ eq : bcrb_generic ] ) lead to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) exhibits a similar dependence as the bcrb ( [ eq : bcrb_generic ] ) in terms of the quantities @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath131 and/or @xmath133 increases , the trace of matrix @xmath134 in ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) gets larger , since @xmath135 ( [ eq : f_rho_def ] ) is a monotonically increasing function . 2 .",
    "in the same environment the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) takes on larger values than the bcrb ( [ eq : bcrb_generic ] ) and results to be a bound tighter to the performance of optimal estimators .",
    "this is due to the fact that the terms @xmath135 appearing in the rhs of ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) give the ezzb approximately the same behaviour of the bcrb ; however , the ezzb also contains terms based on @xmath136 ( [ eq : f_gap_def ] ) , which is a positive valued function .",
    "the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) , unlike the bcrb , is influenced by the shape of map obstructions ( through the @xmath136 function and the @xmath137 , @xmath138 parameters ) .",
    "the two terms of ( [ eq : zzb_generic ] ) depending on the function @xmath136 ( [ eq : f_gap_def ] ) are influenced by the spatial extensions @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the obstructions separating _ consecutive _ map segments ( which are characterized by the lengths @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively ) ; in particular , the impact of obstructions is significant when @xmath49 ( @xmath141 ) is greater than one of @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) . 5 .",

    "the result ( [ eq : zzb_maps_nogap ] ) deserves the following comments :    1 .",
    "the structure of its rhs is similar to that of the equivalent bfim ( [ eq : bfim_maps_nogap ] ) . despite the differences between the integrand functions ,",
    "our numerical results show that in this case both the ezzb and the bcrb are tight and that the ezzb does not provide additional hints on localization accuracy with respect to the bcrb ( see section [ sec : num_res ] ) .",
    "2 .   the ezzb predicts the correct variance of map - aware estimation when the snr is very low whereas a specific assumption about the value of @xmath80 is required to obtain the same result in the bcrb case .",
    "for instance , let us consider a uniform map whose support @xmath23 is a rectangle whose sides have lengths @xmath109 and @xmath110 ; with model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) and for @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( i.e. , for a snr approaching zero ) , the bmse of the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimator tends to @xmath146 .",
    "the ezzb provides this exact result since the rhs of ( [ eq : zzb_maps_nogap ] ) can be put in the closed form @xmath147 and @xmath148 for a snr @xmath149 approaching zero around @xmath150 . ] .",
    "this result can be compared with its bcrb counterpart ; in this case , from ( [ eq : bfim_maps_nogap ] ) it can be inferred that @xmath151 , so that @xmath152 should be selected to match the correct variance .",
    "the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_maps_nogap ] ) confirms that map - aware estimators should be expected to be more accurate than their map - unaware counterparts , at least for maps without obstructions : for instance , if a rectangular map of sides @xmath109 , @xmath110 is considered , then ( [ eq : zzb_rectangle_map ] ) is easily proved to be always smaller than @xmath153 ( because @xmath154 ) which is the trivial ezzb ) after proving that @xmath155 for @xmath156 . ] for the observation model ( [ eq : obs_model_gaussian ] ) when the map is unavailable ( i.e. , when no prior information is available ) .",
    "this derives from the fact that a priori information lowers the ezzb ( similarly to what occurs in the case of the crb and the bcrb ) ; this is a well - known result , but may not be evident in ( [ eq : zzb_maps_nogap ] ) .",
    "4 .   similarly to the bcrb , the dependence on the map area is complicated ; however , it should be expected that the elements of @xmath134 get larger when @xmath157 increases as suggested by the following asymptotic result : when @xmath90 the contribution coming from a priori information vanishes and the ezzb ( [ eq : zzb_rectangle_map ] ) tends to @xmath153 , i.e. , to the map - unaware ezzb , which is larger ( see point 3 ) .    as already mentioned above",
    ", the ezzb allows us to understand the role played by some map features , which do not have any impact on the bcrb",
    ". however , our numerical results evidence that , for complex maps and , in particular , at very low snrs , this bound turns out to be somewhat far from the performance offered by a mmse estimator .",
    "this has motivated the derivation of the wwb @xcite , which can be tighter than the ezzb at very low - snrs .",
    "similarly to the bcrb and the ezzb ( see ( [ eq : bcrb ] ) and ( [ eq : zzb ] ) , respectively ) , the wwb , for 2-d localization , can be expressed as @xmath158 where @xcite @xmath159^{2}\\right\\ } } \\label{eq : wwb_def}\\ ] ] and @xmath160 @xmath161 are functions of the @xmath162 parameter ; moreover @xmath163 is a likelihood ratio and @xmath121 .",
