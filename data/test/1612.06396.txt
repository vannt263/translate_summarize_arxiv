    "quantum key distribution ( qkd )  @xcite establishes cryptographic keys between two distant parties in a way that is cryptanalytically unbreakable .",
    "ground based implementations of qkd using optical fiber links are limited to distances of a few hundred kilometers due to absorption losses , which scale exponentially with distance , leading to insufficient signal - to - noise  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , free space links have been demonstrated over ground with varying distances , both in stationary  @xcite and moving  @xcite configurations . but",
    "despite losses due to geometric effects scaling quadratically with distance , the addition of atmospheric absorption and turbulence , and the necessity of having clear line of sight , limit terrestrial free - space transmissions to , also , a few hundred kilometers .",
    "much greater distances could be spanned in free - space transmissions outside earth s atmosphere .",
    "utilizing orbiting satellites therefore has potential to allow the establishment of global qkd networks , with `` quantum '' satellites acting as intermediaries . such satellites could operate as untrusted nodes linking two ground stations simultaneously  @xcite , or trusted nodes connecting any two ground stations on earth at different times  @xcite .",
    "since 2010 , the canadian space agency ( csa ) has studied the proposed quantum encryption and science satellite ( qeyssat )  @xcite concept , where a mission concept was developed in partnership with com  dev ( now honeywell aerospace ) .",
    "this concept , contrary to many other missions , proposes a quantum uplink , which places the quantum receiver on the satellite while keeping the quantum source at the ground station . under similar conditions ,",
    "the uplink configuration has a lower key generation rate than the downlink , owing to atmospheric turbulence affecting the beam path very early in the propagation . despite this ,",
    "the uplink has a number of advantages over a downlink  @xcite , including relative simplicity of the satellite design , relaxed requirements on processing and storage ( only the photon reception events need be considered , many orders of magnitude less than the source events ) , and the flexibility of being able to incorporate and explore various different quantum source types with the same receiver apparatus .",
    "demonstrations of qkd with moving and airborne platforms take important steps to verifying the readiness of quantum technology , and the supporting classical technology , for deployment within a satellite payload . to date , however , demonstrations of qkd with aircraft have operated exclusively in the downlink configuration  @xcite , where the quantum states are generated and transmitted from the aircraft to a receiver at a stationary ground location . here",
    "we present the first demonstration of qkd to a receiver on a moving aircraft .",
    "our apparatuses incorporate coarse- and fine - pointing systems necessary to establish and maintain optical link , quantum source and measurement components that conduct polarization - encoded qkd , and suitable post - processing algorithms to extract secure key .",
    "the results show good performance at the same angular rates exhibited by low - earth - orbit ( leo ) satellites .",
    "our qkd receiver makes extensive use of components custom - designed according to the mass , volume , power , thermal , and vacuum operating environment requirements of systems to be embedded in a satellite payload ",
    "many components are already space suitable , and others have a clear path to flight . in a recent study , conducted with the university of toronto institute for aerospace studies space flight laboratory ( utias sfl )",
    ", a realistic satellite concept was developed , incorporating the space - ready receiver apparatus demonstrated here , integrated into the flight - proven nemo-150",
    "@xcite micro - satellite bus ( see below ) .",
    "this , together with our airborne operational demonstration , illustrates the technological advancements made towards the development of a space - suitable qkd receiver , and highlights the feasibility and technological readiness of an uplink qkd satellite .",
    "the apparatuses for our demonstration consist of a qkd source and transmitter , located at a ground station near the airstrip of smiths falls ",
    "montague airport , and a qkd receiver , located on a twin otter research aircraft from the national research council of canada .",
    "optical links were only attempted at night , to limit optical noise .",
    "one systems - test day - time flight was conducted ( where the optical links were not attempted ) , followed by night - time flights .",
    "two night - time flights were conducted , each two hours duration and consisting of several passes of varying trajectories .",
    "optical links were established using tracking feedback to two - axis motors , guided by strong beacon lasers ( at a wavelength different from the quantum signal ) and an imaging camera , at each of the two sites .",
    "the qkd signals produced by the source were guided through a telescope on the ground and pointed to the receiver on the aircraft . there",
    "the qkd signal polarizations and times - of - arrival were recorded for later correlation and processing to complete the qkd protocol and extract the key .",
    "we focused on two path types : arcs with ( approximately ) constant radius around the ground station , and straight lines past the ground station . for straight line paths , the distance we quote is the minimum .",
    "over the two nights we performed 14 passes with nominal distances of , , , and , in both line and arc configurations , at an altitude of above sea level  see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : flight7 km ] for the flight path of an arc at radius . for this flight mission concept ,",
    "a sequence of gps coordinates was calculated for each flight , with the start angle relative to the ground station and the distance were used as input .",
    "these coordinates were transferred to the flight software of the aircraft by the pilots .",
    "we developed a decision tree such that , based on the observed performance of each pass , we could immediately select an appropriate course of action ( e.g. to perform troubleshooting or collect data under different conditions ) .",
    "that a mission concept such as this is viable shows that a similar mission concept , appropriate for an orbiting satellite receiver , can realistically be achieved .",
    "0.475     0.475     our qkd source is a significantly improved version of a previous - generation apparatus  @xcite , implementing bb84 with decoy states  @xcite at .",
    "weak coherent pulses at wavelength are generated by combining a narrow - band continuous - wave ( cw ) laser ( l1 ) with triggered - pulsing laser ( l2 ) through sum frequency generation in a periodically poled magnesium oxide ( ppmgo ) waveguide ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : transmitter ] ) . for each pulse ,",
    "one of three intensity levels is chosen : signal , decoy , or vacuum , with probabilities of , , and , respectively .",
    "signal and decoy levels are generated using a fast electro - optical intensity modulator ( i m ) calibrated to emit @xmath0 and @xmath1 mean photon number at the entrance of the transmitter telescope , respectively .",
    "the vacuum state is made by suppressing the laser trigger .",
    "each of the four bb84 polarizations  horizontal ( h ) , vertical ( v ) , diagonal ( d ) , and anti - diagonal ( a)are imposed using two electro - optical phase modulators ( pms ) , each in one arm of a balanced mach - zehnder polarization interferometer . with a balanced input ( d )",
    ", the pms can address any point on the circle through d , right - circular ( r ) , a , and left - circular ( l ) .",
    "a subsequent unitary rotation takes these to d , h , a , and v , respectively . the intensity and polarization states",
    "are generated according to a randomized sequence that repeats every 1000 pulses .",
    "although this is insecure , it is sufficient for our demonstration , while upgrading to a fully random sequence ( e.g. , given by a quantum random number generator ) is straightforward and a suitable system has been identified .",
    "pulse intensities are measured locally through the weak output of an optical fiber splitter ( 90:10 ) connected to a silicon avalanche photodiode ( si - apd ) operating in geiger mode with active quenching .",
    "the bulk of the pulse power is guided from the source to the transmitter through single - mode optical fiber .",
    "the beam passes through a band - pass ( bandwidth ) filter ( to impede trojan - horse attacks  @xcite ) and then a 75:25 beam splitter .",
    "we employ a polarization correction system to undo the unknown unitary rotation applied by the single - mode fiber  the reflected of pulses undergo characterization , while the remaining of pulses pass through a triplet of wave plates ( wps ) in motorized rotation stages that apply a compensation operation to the states , and are finally transmitted through a diameter sky - watcher bk 1206az3 refractive telescope .",
    "the polarization characterization subsystem consists of two beam paths , where each path passes through a port of a rotating chopper wheel that contains linear polarizers .",
    "the linear polarizers are each calibrated to project onto the h , v , d , or a state ",
    "however , one of the two beam paths contains a quarter - wave plate just prior to the chopper wheel , thereby facilitating projections onto a tomographically complete set of three polarization bases : h / v , d / a , and r / l .",
    "the actual state any given photon is projected to depends on which blade of the wheel is open at the time the photon passes through ( the rotation of the wheel is also recorded ) .",
    "the two beams are each coupled into fiber and directed to si - apds . with near real - time analysis of source and detection data ( performed on per - second integrated counts )",
    ", we obtain tomographic reconstructions , for each of the generated polarization states , of the states at the transmitter after the rotation applied by the fiber .",
    "we then optimize the compensating wave plate triplet ( a sequence of quarter- , half- , and quarter - wave plate ) to maximize the fidelity of the states expected after compensation with the nominally generated states .",
    "the optimal positions are given to the motorized stages , applying the ( rotated ) wave plates to pulses that are then transmitted through the telescope towards the receiver .    during our airborne trials , the qkd source optics and electronics , as well as computers for data recording and pointing feedback ,",
    "were located inside of a trailer to maintain thermal and humidity stability .",
    "the transmitter pointing stages , polarization characterization optics , and telescope were located just outside the trailer , with cabling running through a small window . equipped with an electric generator , our ground station is relocatable and self - sufficient .",
    "0.475     0.475     at the receiver ( fig .",
    "[ fig : receiver ] ) , the signal is collected by a tele vue np101is refractive telescope with a aperture , and coupled into a sequence of custom components developed under contract with the canadian space agency  @xcite .",
    "first of these is a fine - pointing unit ( fpu ) , developed with institut national doptique ( ino ) and neptec design group , which guides both the quantum and beacon signals with a fast - steering mirror ( fsm ) . inside the fpu ,",
    "a dichroic mirror separates the quantum and beacon signals  the beacon is reflected towards a quad - cell photo - sensor ( qs ) , providing position feedback to a fine - pointing controller ( fpc ) that guides the fast - steering mirror in a closed loop  @xcite .",
    "the fpu , measuring and , and has a field of view .",
    "the collected quantum beam is guided through a pinhole , acting as a spatial - mode filter  @xcite , followed by a pair of ( bandwidth ) spectral filters .",
    "it then passes into a custom integrated optical assembly ( ioa ) developed with ino , containing a passive - basis - choice polarization analysis module with a 50:50 beam splitter and polarizing beam splitters .",
    "the ioa , measuring and , produces four beams coupled into multimode fibers , corresponding to the four bb84 measurement states ( h , v , d , and a ) with state contrasts between 532:1 and 2577:1 .",
    "the four ioa output fibers are guided to a detector module ( dm ) containing four excelitas technologies slik si - apd detectors operating in geiger mode with passive quenching .",
    "the dm measures and , and operates at steady state ( including thermoelectric cooling of detector active areas to ) to give a detection efficiency of , biased above breakdown .",
    "the detectors trigger low - voltage differential signalling pulses which are measured at a control and data processing unit ( cdpu ) based on xiphos systems corporation s q7 processor card ( recently flown on ghgsat  @xcite ) with a custom daughterboard .",
    "the cdpu utilizes an arm cortex - a9 processor and measures , , drawing while operating . a field - programmable gate array embedded in the cdpu",
    "is programmed to implement time - tagging of detection pulses with a resolution of , while data storage , communication , and processing software running in the linux operating system implement the receiver - side qkd protocol .",
    "the receiver telescope was mounted facing out the cabin door on the port side of the aircraft , and flown with the door removed .",
    "the electronics and computers were located six feet forward in the aircraft cabin , and optical fibers and cables conducted signals between the electronics and the receiver telescope and pointing equipment .",
    "the transmitter and receiver each have a beacon laser assembly ( bla ) consisting of three fiber launchers with fixed divergence angles of and individual tip / tilt control .",
    "these are mounted on each telescope and fed strong ( ) laser light from fiber - coupled beacon laser source ( bls ) arrays located away from the telescopes . a beacon camera ( bc)a 50 frame - per - second , 2 megapixel imaging camera with an band - pass filter ( bandwidth)is also mounted to each telescope .",
    "each telescope is attached to a commercial two - axis motor system ( transmitter : asa ddm85 standard , receiver : flir ptu - d300e ) , providing first - stage `` coarse '' pointing . when light at the beacon wavelength is visible as a bright spot on the camera image , our custom pointing software ( running on pcs at each site ) controls the angular speeds of the motors to minimize the deviation of the spot s position from a calibrated reference position .",
    "the control feedback loop incorporates the estimated angular speed of the spot ( based on position differences between recent images , taking into account previous motor motions ) , a factor proportional to the spot s current deviation , and a factor proportional to the accumulated ( integrated ) spot deviations .",
    "the pointing software operates as a state machine , and also includes a `` coasting '' state to handle short drop - outs of the beacon signal , and `` acquiring '' and `` searching '' states to support the initial acquisition of the beacon .    to achieve initial acquisition ,",
    "we employ inertial navigation modules ( inms ) , containing gps receivers and attitude sensors , mounted to the telescopes .",
    "each site transmits their gps location to the other site via a classical rf ( wi - fi ) link , and then calculates the other site s orientation relative to its own based on its local attitude data . during initial testing , the inms exhibited an attitude uncertainty of about significantly larger than the divergence of the beacon lasers . to mitigate this",
    ", we turn on a bright infra - red light - emitting diode array ( irl ) at the receiver with much greater divergence ( of order ) , allowing the transmitter to find , and point towards , the receiver .",
    "once the receiver sees the transmitter s beacon spot in its camera image and has moved to position , the irl is switched off , and two - way beacon tracking continues for the remainder of the pass .",
    "a necessary practical feature of our transmitter and receiver apparatuses is that they can be independently calibrated , as they were not co - located prior to establishing a link as would be the case in a satellite mission . to align each of the beacon lasers with the quantum signal beam path",
    ", we first inject alignment laser power into each telescope , and point the telescope towards a separate larger - diameter ( ) telescope , located away , equipped with a camera imaging the far field .",
    "we then observe the position of the beacon beams on the camera image , and adjust the tip and tilt of each beacon fiber launcher to center its output over the signal spot . to calibrate the reference position of the beacon camera at the transmitter and the collimation of the transmitted quantum beam , we optimize the power received ( using the alignment laser injected into the transmitter telescope ) at another telescope located at a sufficient distance down the runway .",
    "the receiver beacon camera , which has greater tolerance due to the receiver s fine - pointing unit , is calibrated using a corner cube located away in the nrc hangar .",
    "these alignments were done prior to each flight .",
    "these independent calibrations allowed link acquisition to begin immediately upon the arrival of the airplane in the vicinity of the ground station .",
    "in total , seven of the 14 airplane passes over the ground station successfully established a quantum signal link .",
    "issues , including minor equipment failures ( e.g. , a loose beacon camera lens ) and accidental controller misconfigurations , particularly hampered link establishment during the first night  two of the seven attempts were successful .",
    "these issues were addressed during the intervening day , and the second night had considerably better link establishment rate  five of seven attempts .",
    "( we attribute the two failures on the second night  both attempted straight - line paths  to the fixed orientation of the wi - fi transceiver at the aircraft being poor for this geometry , particularly at the beginning of a pass . )",
    "secret key was extracted out of six of the seven successful passes . from data collected during these passes ,",
    "we observe the performance of the system at various distances and with angular speeds .",
    "circular - arc passes allowed us to demonstrate longer duration of key exchange , compared to straight - line passes , as the receiver telescope held a relatively constant position during the pass , making link establishment and pointing easier .",
    "straight line passes , however , are much more representative of a satellite passing over a ground station , as they simulate the change in angular speed that would be experienced during such a pass .",
    "the maximum angular rate is reached when the airplane is closest to the ground station for that pass  the greatest maximum angular rate we measured for our passes was at a distance of ( arc ) .",
    "this angular rate is consistent with overflying leo spacecraft such as for a orbit , as baselined for qeyssat , or for the international space station ( iss ) .",

    "we assume diffraction - limited divergence , resulting in lower bound theoretical loss estimates .",
    "consequently , the experimental losses we observed are generally higher than the theoretical losses .",
    "the difference between the theoretical loss of an arc pass and the minimum theoretical loss of a line pass at the same nominal distance is due to varying pointing accuracy experienced for each pass , as well as the actual ground distance and altitude deviating from nominal .    for qkd analysis",
    "we utilize a signal - to - noise ( snr ) filter  @xcite , which assesses the total counts in each frame of data and discards any frame with counts less than a threshold , prior to distilling key bits .",
    "we choose thresholds between 1000 and 2500 , depending on the pass .",

    "the qber measured at the receiver drops to a few percent upon optical link lock , and rests at due to the random noise of background detections at all other times . for passes where secure key was generated , the qber measured at the receiver , after the snr filter , varied from .",
    "the received qber during the first night flight was observed to be higher than for the second night , possibly due to an issue with the wave plate motorized stage controller .",
    "we generate secure key bits from the data collected during each pass using algorithms tailored for the asymmetric processing resources that would be available with a satellite platform @xcite .",
    "these algorithms consist of source and receiver event time - correlation ( performed at the ground station ) , error correction utilizing low - density parity check codes , and privacy amplification via reduced - toeplitz - matrix two - universal hashes . to ensure security , the uncertainty due to the finite number of samples used to estimate link parameters must be taken into account .",
    "of the six passes from which key could be extracted , five yielded secure key including these finite - size effects ( where we use the common ten - standard - deviation heuristic to bound parameter estimates @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining pass had too few counts and could only generate secure key assuming no finite - size effects .",
    "we have successfully demonstrated quantum key distribution to a satellite receiver payload prototype on an aircraft moving at up to . our pointing and tracking system was able to establish and maintain an optical link with milli - degree precision over distances while bb84 decoy - state signals were sent across the channel to the aircraft moving at the angular speeds of a leo satellite .",
    "our custom fine - pointing system , ioa , dm , and cdpu , along with the other commercial components , all performed in concert on the aircraft to generate secure keys , of tens to hundreds of kilobits in length , in various flight scenarios , including the straight - line paths approximating the apparent trajectory a leo satellite .",
    "with source intrinsic qber typically and post - processing algorithms representative of what would be achievable with a satellite platform , we extracted finite - size secure key for many of the tested passes .",
    "the details of path - to - flight modifications necessary to construct space - suitable versions of our receiver components varies .",
    "some elements present on the cdpu daughterboard , for example , will need to be replaced with radiation - hard equivalent versions . or",

    "0.4     0.25     for pointing to a satellite from the ground , initial acquisition will likely not have a real - time classical communication link to exchange position data . in this case , however , predictions of the satellite position at the time when a link is to be established can be used , as the orbital trajectory of a satellite is predictable with far greater accuracy than the flight path of an airplane . in this context , point - ahead may be necessary ( depending on the transmitter s divergence ) to ensure that the quantum beam is coincident with the satellite when it arrives , owing to the satellite s motion during the time of flight of the optical signals .",
    "a fine - pointing system would likely also be required to achieve sufficient accuracy over the significantly larger transmission distance . for the aircraft ,",

    "<S> satellite - based quantum terminals are a feasible way to extend the reach of quantum communication protocols such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) to the global scale . to that end </S>",
    "<S> , prior demonstrations have shown qkd transmissions from airborne platforms to receivers on ground , but none have shown qkd transmissions from ground to a moving aircraft , the latter scenario having simplicity and flexibility advantages for a hypothetical satellite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , for the first time , qkd from a ground transmitter to a receiver prototype mounted on an airplane in flight . </S>",
    "<S> we have specifically designed our receiver prototype to consist of many components that are compatible with the environment and resource constraints of a satellite . coupled with our relocatable ground station system , optical links with distances of were maintained and quantum signals transmitted while traversing angular rates similar to those observed of low - earth - orbit satellites . </S>",
    "<S> for some passes of the aircraft over the ground station , links were established within of position data transmission , and with link times of a few minutes and received quantum bit error rates typically , we generated secure keys up to in length . by successfully generating secure keys over several different pass configurations , we demonstrate the viability of technology that constitutes a quantum receiver satellite payload and </S>",
