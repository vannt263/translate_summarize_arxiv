    "planets that transit their stars offer us the opportunity to study the physics of planetary atmospheres and interiors , which may help constrain theories of planet formation . from the photometric light curve",
    ", we can measure the planetary radius and also the orbital inclination , which when combined with radial velocity ( rv ) observations , allows us to measure the mass and density of the planet .",
    "infrared observations of planets during secondary eclipse can be used to measure the planet s thermal spectrum @xcite , and spectroscopic observations around the time of transit can constrain the composition of the planet s atmosphere through transmission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "additionally , optical observations of the secondary eclipse can probe a planet s albedo @xcite .",
    "all of the known transiting planets are hot jupiters or hot neptunes , which orbit so close to their parent stars that the stellar flux plays a major role in heating these planets .",
    "in contrast , the detection of transiting planets with longer periods ( @xmath1 ) and consequently lower equilibrium temperatures , would allow us to probe a completely different regime of stellar insolation , one more like that of jupiter and saturn whose energy budgets are dominated by their internal heat .    currently , it is not feasible to find long - period , transiting planets from the ground .",
    "while rv surveys have found @xmath2 planets with periods @xmath3 , it is unlikely that any of these transit their parent star , given that for a solar - type host , the transit probability is very small , @xmath4 .",
    "thus the sample of long - period planets detected by rv will need to at least double before a transiting planet is expected .",
    "given the long lead time necessary to detect long - period planets with rv observations , this is unlikely to happen in the near future .",
    "furthermore , the expected transit times for long - period systems are relatively uncertain , which makes the coordination and execution of photometric follow - up observations difficult . putting all this together ,",
    "radial velocity surveys are clearly an inefficient means to search for long - period , transiting planets .",
    "ground - based photometric transit surveys are similarly problematic . a long - period system must be monitored for a long time because typically , at least two transits must be observed in order to measure the period of the system .",
    "furthermore , if there are a couple of days of bad weather at the wrong time , the transit event will be missed entirely , rendering years of data worthless .",
    "thus transit surveys for long - period planets require many years of nearly uninterrupted observations .",
    "additionally , many thousands of suitable stars must be monitored to find a single favorably - inclined system .",
    "because of its long mission lifetime ( @xmath5 ) , nearly continuous observations , and large number of target stars ( @xmath6 ) , the _ kepler _ satellite @xcite has a unique opportunity to discover long - period transiting systems",
    ". not only will _ kepler _ observe multiple transits of planets with periods up to the mission lifetime , but it is also likely to observe single transits of planets with periods longer than the mission lifetime . as the period of a system increases beyond @xmath7 , the probability of observing more than one transit decreases until , for periods longer @xmath8 , only one transit will ever be observed . for periods longer than @xmath8 , the probability of seeing a single transit diminishes as @xmath9 .",
    "even with only a single transit observation from _ kepler _ , these long - period planets are invaluable .",
    "we show that planets with periods longer than the mission lifetime will likely be detected and can be characterized using the _ kepler _ photometry and precise radial velocity observations .",
    "furthermore , this technique can be applied to planets that will transit more than once during the _ kepler _ mission , so that targeted increases in the time - sampling rate can be made at the times of subsequent transits .    in @xmath10[sec : np ] we calculate the number of one- and two - transit systems _ kepler _ is expected to observe .",
    "we give a general overview of how the _ kepler _ photometry and radial velocity follow - up observations can be combined to characterize a planet in @xmath10[sec : basic ] .",
    "we discuss in @xmath10[sec : lc ] the expected uncertainties in the light curve observables , and we relate these to uncertainties in physical quantities , such as the period , that can be derived from the transit light curve .",
    "@xmath10[sec : rv ] describes the expected uncertainties associated with the rv curve and how they influence the uncertainty in the mass of the planet .",

    "the number of single - transit events _ kepler _ can expect to find is the integral of the probability that a given system will be favorably inclined to produce a transit , multiplied by the probability that a transit will occur during the mission , convolved with a distribution of semimajor axes , and normalized by the expected frequency of planets and the number of stars that _ kepler _ will observe ,    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the total number of transiting systems expected , @xmath13 is the number of stars being monitored , @xmath14 is the probability that the system is favorably inclined to produce a transit ( the transit probability ) , @xmath15 is the probability that a transit will occur during the mission , and @xmath16 is some distribution of the planet semimajor axis @xmath17 , normalized to the expected frequency of planets .    assuming a circular orbit ,",
    "the transit probability is simply , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the radius and mass of the parent star , and @xmath21 is the period of the system .",
    "we consider both the probability of observing exactly one transit , @xmath22 , and the probability of observing exactly two transits , @xmath23 .",
    "these probabilities are @xmath24 @xmath25 thus there will be a range in periods from @xmath7 to @xmath8 where it is possible to get either one or two transits during the mission . if we assume a mission lifetime of @xmath26 years and a solar - type star ( @xmath27 ) , we can find the total probability ( @xmath28 ) of observing a planet that transits _ and _ exhibits exactly one or exactly two transits as a function of period or semimajor axis .",
    "these probability distributions as functions of @xmath17 are shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : np ] .    for @xmath29 ,",
    "the total probability , @xmath30 , of observing a single transit is @xmath31 thus the probability that the planet will transit _ and _ that a single transit will occur during the mission is generally small for periods at the mission lifetime , and beyond this is a strongly decreasing function of the period , @xmath32 or @xmath33 .    the observed distribution of semimajor axes for planets with minimum masses @xmath34 is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : np ] , where @xmath35 is the mass of the planet",
    ", @xmath36 is the orbital inclination , and the data are taken from the `` catalog of nearby exoplanets '' of @xcite .",
    "note that we have included multiple - planet systems .",
    "we normalized the distribution by assuming that 8.5% of all stars have planets with @xmath34 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we can extrapolate this distribution to larger semimajor axes by observing that it is approximately constant as a function of @xmath38 and adopting the value found by @xcite , @xmath39 . using this extrapolation",
    ", we predict @xmath40 and @xmath41 of stars have a @xmath34 planet within @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we find the number of planets expected for _ kepler _ by convolving this normalized distribution with the probability distribution and multiplying by @xmath44 .",
    "we convolve the distribution of semimajor axes with the total transit probability distribution by weighting the probability of observing a transit for each member of the bin to determine an overall probability for the bin . the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : np ] shows the resulting distribution of one- and two - transit systems . integrating this distribution over all semimajor axes out to the limit of current rv observations",
    "predicts that _ kepler _ will observe a total of 4.0 single - transit systems and 5.6 two - transit systems during the mission lifetime of @xmath45 .",
    "if we include the extrapolation of the observed distribution to larger semimajor axes , the integrated number of single - transit systems increases to 5.7 ; the effect is modest because the probability of observing a transit declines rapidly with increasing semimajor axis ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , _ kepler _ is likely to detect at least handful of single - transit events .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that this is a lower limit .",
    "first , our estimate does not include planets with @xmath47 , primarily because rv surveys are substantially incomplete for low - mass , long - period planets .",
    "as we will show , _ kepler _ will be able to constrain the periods of planets with radii as small as that of neptune with the detection of a single transit .",
    "indeed , microlensing surveys indicate that cool , neptune - mass planets are common @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite and @xcite showed that a distribution in eccentricity increases the probability that a planet will transit its parent star .",
    "finally , if the _ kepler _ survey lifetime is extended , the number of detections of long - period transiting planets will also increase .",
    "one might assume that a single - transit event must simply be discarded from the sample because the event is not confirmed by a second transit , and the period can not be constrained by the time between successive transits .",
    "although we do not expect to see many of them , long - period transiting planets are precious , as the information we could potentially gain by observing these systems when they transit in the future would allow us to greatly enhance our understanding of the physical properties of outer giant planets , and in particular would allow us to compare them directly to our own solar system giants .",
    "thus , these single transit events should be saved , if at all possible .    .",

    "the probability distribution has been convolved with the observed fraction of planets and multiplied by the number of stars kepler will observe ( 100,000 ) to give the number of single transit systems ( solid line ) and two transit systems ( dotted line ) that can be expected .",

    "with a few basic assumptions , _ kepler _ photometry of a transiting planet can provide a period for the system that can be combined with precise radial velocity measurements to estimate a mass for the planet . here",
    "we briefly sketch the basics of how these properties can be estimated and what their uncertainties are , and we provide details in the following sections .",
    "we assume the planet is much less massive than the star , @xmath49 , and circular orbits .",
    "we consider the impact of eccentricity on our conclusions in  [ sec : e ] .    assuming no limb - darkening and assuming the out - of - transit flux is known perfectly",
    ", a transit can be characterized by four observables , namely the fractional depth of the transit @xmath50 , the full - width half - maximum of the transit @xmath51 , the ingress / egress duration @xmath52 , and the time of the center of transit @xmath53 .",
    "these can be combined to estimate the instantaneous velocity of the planet at the time of transit , @xmath54 for a circular orbit , @xmath55 can be used to estimate the period of the planet @xmath56 where we have employed kepler s third law assuming that the planet s mass is much smaller than the star s mass .",
    "thus , if the stellar density @xmath57 is known , then the planet s period can be estimated from photometry of a single transit @xcite .",
    "note that there is a degeneracy between @xmath57 and @xmath21 , so with a single transit @xmath57 must be determined by other means in order to derive an estimate of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath57 can be estimated via spectroscopy combined with theoretical isochrones , or asteroseismology .",
    "the total uncertainty in the period is the quadrature sum of the contribution from the estimate of @xmath57 and the contribution from the _ kepler _ photometry ( i.e. , the uncertainty at fixed @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 the contribution from _ kepler _ is dominated by the uncertainty in the ingress / egress time @xmath52 , @xmath59 where we have assumed @xmath60 , and that the number of points taken out of transit is much larger than the number taken during the transit ( and thus the out - of - transit flux is known essentially perfectly ) . here",
    "@xmath61 is approximately equal to the total signal - to - noise ratio of the transit , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the photon collection rate . for _ kepler",
    "_ we assume , @xmath64 and thus _ kepler _ will detect a single transit with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the radius of the planet . for a neptune - size planet with these fiducial parameters , @xmath67 .",
    "_ kepler s _ contribution to the uncertainty in the period is , @xmath68 where we have assumed the impact parameter @xmath69 .",
    "due to the strong scaling with @xmath66 and relatively weak scaling with @xmath21 , there are essentially two regimes . for @xmath70 , the uncertainty in @xmath21",
    "is dominated by uncertainties in the estimate of @xmath57 , which is expected to be @xmath71 , whereas for @xmath72 , it is very difficult to estimate the period due to the uncertainty in @xmath52 from the _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "once the period is known from the photometry , the mass of the planet , @xmath35 , can be measured with radial velocity observations . for a circular orbit , and for observations spread out over a time that is short compared to @xmath21",
    ", the radial velocity of the star can be expanded about the time of transit , and so approximated by the velocity at the time of transit @xmath73 , plus a constant acceleration @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the stellar radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "thus , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the surface gravity of the star , and we have assumed @xmath80 .",
    "the uncertainty in the planet mass has contributions from three distinct sources : the uncertainty in @xmath79 , which can be estimated from spectroscopy , the uncertainty in @xmath74 , which is derived from rv observations after the transit , and the uncertainties in @xmath81 and @xmath50 , which are derived from _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty in @xmath52 dominates over the uncertainties in @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we may write , @xmath82 for reasonable assumptions and long - period planets ( @xmath83 ) , we find that the uncertainty in @xmath74 dominates over the uncertainty in @xmath52 .    assuming that @xmath84 equally - spaced rv measurements with precision @xmath85 are taken over a time period @xmath86 after the transit , the uncertainty in @xmath74 is , @xmath87 where we have assumed @xmath88 .",
    "thus , radial velocity observations combined with _",
    "kepler _ photometry can confirm the planetary nature of a jupiter - sized planet in a relatively short time span .",
    "an accurate ( @xmath89 ) measurement of the mass for a jupiter - mass planet , or even a rough characterization of the mass for a neptune - mass planet , will require either more measurements , or measurements with substantially higher rv precision .",
    "of course , additional radial velocity observations over a time span comparable to @xmath21 will further constrain the mass and period .    in @xmath10[sec : lc ] and @xmath10[sec : rv ] , we derive the above expressions for the uncertainty in the mass and the period of the planet using a fisher information analysis .",
    "in the absence of significant limb - darkening , a transit light curve can be approximated by a trapezoid that is described by the five parameters @xmath53 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath50 , and @xmath90 , where @xmath90 is the out - of - transit flux .",

    "@xmath50 is the depth of the transit ( e.g. , in units of flux ) , rather than the fractional depth .",
    "these two definitions differ by a factor of @xmath90 such that @xmath97 .",
    "however , when @xmath98 ( as will be the case for _ kepler _ ) , the uncertainty in @xmath90 is negligible , and so one may define @xmath99 , thus making these two parametrizations equivalent .",

    "we see that the trapezoidal model provides an excellent approximation to the exact light curve , and as we will show the analytic parameter uncertainties are quite accurate .",
    "we also show the case of significant limb - darkening as expected for a sun - like star observed in the _ r_-band ( similar to the _ kepler _ bandpass ) . in this case , the match is considerably poorer , but nevertheless we will show the analytic parameter uncertainties we derive assuming the simple trapezoidal model still provide useful estimates ( see @xcite for a more thorough discussion ) .",

    "in the case of the long - period transiting planets that will be observed by _ kepler _ , we can simplify the full expression by making a couple of assumptions .",

    "however , our study addresses this topic from a very different perspective .    in  [ sec :",
    "basic ] we demonstrated that , under the assumption that @xmath160 , the planet period @xmath21 and mass @xmath35 can be inferred from two observables : the velocity of the planet at the time of transit @xmath161 , and the projected acceleration of the star @xmath74 . in the case of a non - zero eccentricity , there are two additional unknown parameters : the eccentricity @xmath157 and the argument of periastron of the planet @xmath162 .",
    "thus , with only two observables ( @xmath161 and @xmath74 ) and four unknowns ( @xmath163 ) , it is not possible to obtain a unique solution .",
    "although a unique solution to the planet parameters does not exist using the observable parameters alone , it may nevertheless be possible to obtain an interesting constraint on @xmath21 and/or @xmath35 by adopting reasonable priors on @xmath157 and @xmath162 .",
    "from the transit observables , one can estimate the velocity of the planet at the time of transit ( eq . [ eqn : vtr ] ) . in the case of @xmath164 ,",
    "this is given by , @xmath165 where here and throughout this section we assume @xmath166 .",

    "in fact , because the probability that a planet with a given @xmath17 transits its parent star depends on @xmath157 and @xmath162 @xcite , a proper bayesian estimate , accounting for these selection effects , might reduce the range of inferred values for @xmath21 significantly .    what can be learned from rv observations immediately after the transit ?",
    "expanding the stellar projected velocity around the time of transit , we can write , @xmath171 the projected acceleration of the star at the time of transit is , @xmath172 this can be combined with @xmath55 to derive the mass of the planet , @xmath173 thus , for a fixed eccentricity , the inferred mass relative to the assumption of a circular orbit has extremes of , @xmath174 which for @xmath169 yields a range of @xmath175 , which is generally _ smaller _ than the contribution to the uncertainty in @xmath35 due to the measurement uncertainty in @xmath74 for our fiducial case of @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : sigbscale ] ) .",
    "we may also consider what can be learned if it is possible measure the curvature of the stellar radial velocity variations immediately after transit .",
    "the projected stellar jerk is given by , @xmath178 this can be combined with @xmath161 and @xmath74 to provide an independent constraint on a combination of the eccentricity and argument of periastron , @xmath179 unfortunately , it will be quite difficult to measure @xmath180 . using the same fisher formalism as we used to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath74 (  [ sec : append ] ) , assuming @xmath84 evenly - spaced rv measurements with precision @xmath85 , taken over time span @xmath86 after the transit , the uncertainty in @xmath180 is , @xmath181 where we have assumed @xmath88 . for our fiducial parameters ,",
    "the fractional uncertainty in @xmath180 is , @xmath182 where we have approximated @xmath183 .",
    "we conclude that , in order to obtain interesting constraints on the eccentricity of long - period planets detected by _ kepler _ , higher - precision rv measurements taken over a baseline comparable to @xmath184 will be needed .",
    "the discovery of long - period transiting planets along with subsequent follow - up observations would greatly enhance our understanding of the physics of planetary atmospheres and interiors .",
    "such planets would allow us to gather constraints in a regime of parameter space currently only occupied by our own giant planets , namely planets whose energy budgets are dominated by their residual internal heat , rather than by stellar insolation .",
    "these constraints , in turn , might provide new insights into planet formation . in this paper , we demonstrated that it will be possible to detect and characterize such long - period planets using observations of single transits by the _ kepler _ satellite , combined with precise radial velocity measurements taken immediately after the transit .",
    "indeed , these results can be generalized to any transiting planet survey using the scaling relations we provide , and it may be particularly interesting to apply them to the _ convection , rotation & planetary transits ( corot ) _",
    "mission @xcite .",
    "we calculated that _ kepler _",
    "will see a few long - period , single transit events and showed that , for circular orbits , the period of the system can be derived from the _ kepler _ light curve of a single event .",
    "we derived an expression for the uncertainty in this period and showed that it is dominated by the uncertainty in the stellar density derived from spectroscopy ( which we assume is @xmath185 ) for planets with radii larger than the radius of neptune , rather than being dependent on the properties of the transit itself .",
    "this method can also be applied to planets that _",
    "kepler _ will observe more than once , so that the second time a planet is expected to transit _ kepler _ can make a selective improvement to its time sampling to better characterize the transit .",
    "we have also shown how the mass of the planet can be constrained by acquiring precise ( @xmath186 ) radial velocity measurements beginning shortly after the transit occurs .",
    "we have shown that 20 measurements over 3 months can measure the mass of a jupiter - sized object to within a factor of a few and that extending those observations to 40 measurements over 6 months significantly reduces the uncertainty in the mass . knowing the mass to within a factor of a few in such a short time can distinguish between brown dwarfs and planets rapidly and allow us to maximize our use of radial velocity resources .",
    "we explored the effect of eccentricity on the ability to estimate the planet mass and period .",
    "allowing for a non - zero eccentricity adds two additional parameters , and as a result it is not possible to obtain a unique solution for the planet mass , period , eccentricity , and argument of periastron .",
    "however , by adopting a reasonable prior on the eccentricity of the planet , the period and mass of the planet can still be estimated to within a factor of a few .",
    "detailed characterization of the planet properties will require precision rv measurements obtained over a duration comparable to the period of the planet .",
    "thus , in the interest of `` getting the most for your money , '' we have shown that the sensitivity of _ kepler _ extends to planets with periods beyond its nominal mission lifetime . with the launch of the _ kepler _ satellite ,",
