    "investigation of spin - dependent interactions of elementary particles at high energies is a very important part of a program of scientific research has been preparing for carry out at storage rings ( rhic , cern , cosy ) .",
    "it is well known in experimental particle physics how to measure a total spin - dependent cross - section of proton - proton ( pp ) and proton - deuteron ( pd ) ( or proton - nucleus ( pn ) ) and deuteron - nucleus ( dn)interactions .",
    "through analicity we can get dispersion relations between the real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "these relations are very valuable for analyzing interactions , especially if we know both real and imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude in a broad energy range through the independent experimental measurements .",
    "there are several experimental possibilities for the indirect measurement of the real part of the forward scattering amplitude @xcite .    *",
    "since no scattering experiment is possible in the forward direction , the determination of the real part of the forward amplitudes has always consisted in the measurement of well chosen elastic scattering observables at small angles and then in the extrapolation of these observables towards zero angle @xcite*. all of these methods , however , contain discrete ambiguities in the reconstruction of the forward scattering matrix , which can be removed only by new independent measurements .",
    "consequently , what is needed is a direct reconstruction of the real part of the forward scattering matrix such we have in the case of the imaginary part through the measurement of a total cross section .",
    "it has been shown in [ 2 - 9 ] that there is an unambiguous method which makes possible the direct measurement of the real part of the spin - dependent forward scattering amplitude in the high energy range .",
    "this technique is based on the effect of proton ( deuteron ) beam spin rotation in a polarized nuclear target and ( it is very important)on the phenomenon of deuteron spin rotation and oscillation in a nonpolarized target .",
    "this technique uses the measurement of angle of spin rotation of high energy proton ( neutron ) in conditions of transmission experiment - the so - called spin rotation experiment .",
    "the analogous phenomenon for the thermal neutrons was theoretically predicted by baryshevsky and podgoretsky in @xcite and experimentally observed by abragam and forte groups [ 11 - 13 ] ( the phenomena of nuclear precession of the neutron spin in a nuclear pseudomagnetic field of a target ) .    it should be noticed that usually the spin state of high energy particles passing through a target is analyzed in the arrangement studying the spin rotation ( see fig.[conventional ] ) .",
    "= 8 cm    in the present paper it is shown that we can reverse experiment arrangement to study spin rotation and oscillation of particles of a gas target , through which a beam of high energy particles passes ( see fig.[second ] ) .",
    "such experiment arrangement make it realizable for a storage ring and allows one to study the zero - angle scattering amplitude at the highest possible energies .",
    "life - time of a particle beam in a storage ring can reach several hours .",
    "life - time of a particle in a gas target ( gas trap ) is long too .",
    "particles circulate in the storage ring with the frequency @xmath0 of several mhz .",
    "this yields to the @xmath0-fold increase of the current of the beam of high energy particle , which blows the gas trap , in comparison with the single - pass case .",
    "finally , this causes the the perfectly acceptable angle of spin rotation of particles containing in the gas cell .",
    "= 8 cm    this paper , then , is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the relation between the index of refraction and effective potential energy of a particle in medium is discussed .",
    "section iii considers phenomenon of spin rotation of a particle captured to a trap under the action of a beam of polarized particles .",
    "expressions for effective potential energy and the angle of spin rotation are derived for particles in the trap .",
    "section iv studies rotation and oscillation of deuteron spin .",
    "estimations for the angle of rotation show that the effect can be experimentally observed .",
    "close connection between the coherent elastic scattering amplitude at zero angle @xmath1 and the refraction index of medium @xmath2 has been established as a result of numerous studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of particles per @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the wave number of a particle incident on a target .    during derivation of ( [ refr_ind ] )",
    "it is supposed that @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 then @xmath9 grows and expression for @xmath2 has the form @xmath10    let us consider refraction on the vacuum - medium boundary .",
    "the wave number of the particle in vacuum is denoted @xmath6 , @xmath11 is the wave number of the particle in medium .",
    "= 5 cm    as it can be seen , the kinetic energy of a particle in vacuum @xmath12 is not equal to that in medium @xmath13 .    from the energy conservation condition we immediately obtain the necessity to suppose that a particle in medium possesses effective potential energy ( see detailed theory in @xcite .",
    ") this energy can be found easily from evident equality @xmath14 i.e. @xmath15    above we considered the rest target . but",
    "in storage rings moving bunches are usually used as a target .",
    "therefore we should generalize expressions ( [ refr_ind],[u1 ] ) for this case .",
    "thus , let us consider cross - collision of two bunches of particles .",
    "suppose that in the rest frame of storage ring the particles of the first beam have the energy @xmath16 and lorentz - factor @xmath17 , whereas particles of the second beam are characterized by the energy @xmath18 and lorentz - factor @xmath19 .",
    "let us recollect that phase of the wave in medium is lorentz - invariant .",
    "therefore , we can find it by the following way .",
    "let us choose the reference frame , where the second beam rests .",
    "as in this frame the substance of the second beam rests , then refraction index can be expressed in conventional form ( [ refr_ind ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density of the bunch 2 in its rest frame and @xmath22 is the density of the second bunch in the storage ring frame , @xmath23 is the wavenumber of particles of the first bunch in the rest frame of the bunch 2 .",
    "let us denote the length of the bunch 2 in its rest frame as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the length of this bunch in the storage ring frame .",
    "now we can find the change of the phase of the wave caused by the interaction of particle 1 with the particles of bunch 2 : @xmath27    it is known that the ratio @xmath28 is invariant , so we can write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the amplitude of elastic coherent forward scattering of particle 1 by the moving particle 2 in the rest frame of the storage ring .    as a result @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity of relative motion of the particle 1 and bunch 2 , if the first particle is nonrelativistic whereas the second that is relativistic , then @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the light velocity , @xmath35 is the time of interaction of the particle 1 with the bunch 2 in the rest frame of the storage ring .",
    "the particle with velocity @xmath36 passes the distance @xmath37 over time @xmath35 .",
    "it should be noted that the path length @xmath38 differs from the length of bunch 2 , because it moves",
    ". expression ( [ phase1])can be rewritten by the use of @xmath38 : @xmath39 where the index of refraction of the particle 1 by the beam of moving particles 2 .",
    "@xmath40 if @xmath41 , the conventional expression ( 1 ) follows from ( [ r_ind_z ] )    so , let us consider particles captured to a trap .",
    "they are nonrelativistic . from ( [ u1 ] ) @xmath42 can be expressed as : @xmath43 where @xmath19 is the lorentz - factor of the bunch 2 , the lorentz - factor of the particle 1 is @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "it should be noted that the amplitude of coherent elastic scattering at zero angle depends on t - matrix as follows : @xmath46 i.e. the amplitude of forward scattering is proportional to the lorentz - factor @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "the quantity @xmath47 depends on the energy of a particle only due to possible dependence of t - matrix on energy . from ( [ u_],[t - matrix ] ) one can obtain @xmath48",
    "in 1964 it was shown @xcite that while slow neutrons are propagating through the target with polarized nuclei , a new effect of nucleon spin precession occurred .",
    "it is stipulated by the fact that neutrons in a polarized target possess two refraction indices : @xmath49 for neutrons with the spin parallel to the target polarization vector and @xmath50 for neutrons with the opposite spin orientation , @xmath51 . from the above",
    "it follows that in a medium with polarized nuclei , neuterons possess two effective potential energies : @xmath52 for neutrons with the spin parallel to the target polarization vector and @xmath53 for neutrons with the opposite spin orientation , @xmath54 .",
    "this resembles interaction of neutrons with a magnetic field , where the energy of interaction depends on the relative orientation of neuteron spin and magnetic field . according to @xcite , this comparison enables one to conclude that in a target with polarized nuclei there is a nuclear pseudomagnetic field and the interaction of an incident neutron with this field results in neutron spin rotation .",
    "the results @xcite , had initiated experiments , which proved the existence of this effect [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "let us consider the experiment arrangement shown in fig.2 .",
    "gas of polarized particles ( nuclei , atoms ) is contained in a cell .",
    "a beam of relativistic polarized particles passes through the cell .",
    "the relativistic beam is a moving target .",
    "let us study the polarization vector of particles captured to the cell . to describe this vector behavior , it is necessary to find effective potential energy of interaction of pacticles captured to the cell with the relativistic beam passing through it .",
    "first fo all the amplitude of elastic coherent zero - angle scattering of a nucleon by a polarized nucleon ( nucleus ) should be considered .",
    "general form of this amplitude with allowance for strong electromagnetic and weak interactions is given in @xcite .",
    "below we shall consider the cell containing protons ( nuclei with spin @xmath55 ) .",
    "the beam of polarized protons passes through it .",
    "let us take into account only strong p-,t - invariant interactions .",
    "in this case , the explicit structure of the elastic scattering amplitude of a particle with the spin 1/2 by a particle with the spin 1/2  ( see , for example , @xcite ) proceeds from the following simple reasoning . in our case , the elastic scattering amplitude at zero angle depends on the spin operators  @xmath56 , @xmath57 of an incident particle ( beam ) and that of a cell , and also on the relative momentum of particles @xmath58 , i.e. , on @xmath59 .",
    "operators @xmath60 @xmath61 can be contained in the expression for the amplitude only in the first degree , as higher degrees  of @xmath62 reduce either to a number or @xmath63 .",
    "the combinations @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 must be such that the scattering amplitude is  a scalar and invariant in space and time reflections .",
    "these conditions definitely determine its general form :    @xmath67    by averaging the amplitude @xmath68  with the help of a spin matrix of the density of particles @xmath69 , the elastic coherent scattering amplitude may be written as :    @xmath70    where @xmath71@xmath72 is the polarization vector of a particle in beam .",
    "amplitude @xmath73 can be expressed as @xmath74 where @xmath75 .    to simplify further reasoning",
    "let us consider the situation when vector @xmath76 is either parallel to @xmath66  ( @xmath77 ) or perpendicular to @xmath78 ( @xmath79 )",
    ".    in this case one has that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus in these cases vector @xmath82 is directed along @xmath83 selecting quantization axes parallel to @xmath84 , one can see that scattering amplitude @xmath85  of proton ( nucleus ) with spin parallel to @xmath84 is not equal to scattering amplitude @xmath86  of proton ( nucleus ) with spin antiparallel to @xmath84 .",
    "hence , corresponding effective potential energies are not equal to each other ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "let us consider a particle , which spin is parallel to the vector of polarization of beam particles @xmath84 . from (",
    "8) it follows that effective potential energy of such a particle captured in a trap is    @xmath88    here and below @xmath89 denotes the mass of the particle ( nuclei ) captured in the trap , @xmath90 is the density of the beam rotating in a storage ring , @xmath91 is the amplitude of elastic coherent forward scattering of the particle captured in the trap ( particle 1 ) by the particle of the beam ( particle 2 ) in the rest frame of the beam ( particle 2 ) , @xmath92 is the energy of the entrapped particle in the rest frame of the beam , @xmath93 is the lorentz - factor of the particle 2 .",
    "the latter frame is the laboratory frame by definition .",
    "effective potential energy of particle with opposite spin direction is    @xmath94    suppose that spin of the nucleon captured in a trap is oriented at the certain angle to the vector @xmath84 .",
    "this state of nucleon can be described as superposition of two states with spins directed along and opposite to the vector @xmath84 .",
    "spin wave function of nucleon at time moment @xmath95 can be expressed as :    @xmath96    or    @xmath97    the state @xmath98 possesses effective potential energy @xmath52 and the state @xmath99 is characterized by @xmath53 . hence , the spin wave function of a nucleon blowing on by a beam of high energy particles changes with time @xmath35 as follows :    @xmath100    one can find nucleon polarization vector at the time moment @xmath35    @xmath101    and as a result    @xmath102    suppose that nucleon spin in time moment @xmath95 is perpendicular to the beam polarization vector @xmath84 .",
    "the axes @xmath38 is directed along the beam polarization vector @xmath84 .",
    "direction of nucleon spin in time moment @xmath95 defines the axes @xmath103 . in this case @xmath104 using ( [ p - project ] ) we obtain    @xmath105    @xmath106 is the frequency of nucleon spin precession around polarization vector @xmath84 , @xmath107 is the total cross - section of scattering in laboratory frame for particles with parallel ( antiparallel ) spins . it should be noted that @xmath108 .    according to ( [ p-2 ] ) the polarization vector of a nucleon , being blown by the beam of relativistic particles , rotates around nuclei polarization vector @xmath84 at the angle    @xmath109    this rotation is similar to the spin rotation appearing in magnetic field .",
    "then we can conclude that the beam of relativistic particles acts on spin of particles captured in a trap by the nuclear pseudomagnetic field @xcite , which causes precession of spin of entrapped particles .",
    "above we considered only cases with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "in general case forward scattering amplitude is expressed by ( [ ampl_g ] ) : @xmath112 effective potential energy can be written as : @xmath113 the shrdinger equation for spin wave function of a particle can be written as @xmath114 and let to find behavior of spin of particles captured in a trap at arbitrary orientation of @xmath84 and @xmath58 .    in general case a particle captured to a trap is affect by an electromagnetic field , in particular , an external magnetic field @xmath115 .",
    "the energy of interaction of the particle with the external field should be added to @xmath116 . as a result ,",
    "if in a gas cell there is a magnetic field @xmath115 , then the potential energy of a particle in a trap is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the magnetic moment of a proton ( nucleus ) captured in a trap .",
    "typically , the proton ( nucleus ) occur appears in the trap as a constituent part of an atom . in this case to describe the behavior of proton ( nucleus ) spin one should use shrdinger equation for spin wavefunction @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the spin hamiltonian of the atom , which describes hyperfine interaction of the proton and electron interaction in the atom , @xmath121 @xmath122 is the magnetic moment of an electron .",
    "suppose a deuteron is placed to a gas trap .",
    "deuteron spin is equal to 1 .",
    "this makes the picture of spin behavior more rich .",
    "potential energy of interaction of the deuteron with a particle beam passing through the trap and external fields can be expressed as follows :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the operator of deuteron magnetic moment , @xmath89 is the mass of deutron , @xmath125 is the amplitude of elastic coherent scattering of the deuteron by beam particles .",
    "in contrast to the particles with spin @xmath55 rotation and oscillation of the deuteron spin appear even while a deuteron passes through unpolarized medium .",
    "therefore , let us consider in details the case when a beam of nonpolarized particles passes through a trap .",
    "let us also suppose that there is no external magnetic field .",
    "it is important that even for unpolarized medium the amplitude of zero - angle scattering @xmath125 is a function of the particle spin operator and can be written as    @xmath126    the quantization axis @xmath38 is directed along @xmath127 .",
    "consider a specific case of strong interactions invariant under space and time reflections .",
    "for this reason , the terms containing odd powers of @xmath128 are neglected .",
    "correspondingly , the contribution to the effective potential energy , which is caused by the interaction of a deuteron with a beam of passing particles , can be expressed as @xmath129    from eq .",
    "( [ n_hat ] ) one can draw an important conclusion about @xmath130 being dependent on the spin orientation with respect to the momentum direction .",

    "as one can see , the picture of splitting of deuteron energy levels under the action of the passing beam coincides with that of splitting of atom energy levels in an electric field due to the stark effect .",
    "thus one can guess that a deuteron in a medium undergoes the action of some effective quasielectric nuclear field , caused by nuclear interactions of the deuteron with the passing proton ( nucleus ) .",

    "now we can evaluate the phase of spin oscillation of the deuterons captured in trap , which appears under the action of the beam of unpolarized particles rotating in the storage ring .",
    "@xmath225    the expression ( 48 ) could be rewritten as follows : @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the compton wavelength , @xmath228 is the number of particles passed through the target during the time @xmath35 , @xmath229 is the cross - section of the particle beam , which passes through the target , @xmath230 is the number of particles rotating in the storage ring , @xmath0 is the frequency of their rotation in orbit .",
    "suppose that @xmath231 , @xmath232 @xmath233 and @xmath234 one can obtain @xmath235 . therefore , for @xmath236 @xmath237 and @xmath238 @xmath239 .",
    "attention should be drawn to the fact that hydrogen atom in triplet state has spin 1 .",
    "therefore , all the above is relevant for a cell containing hydrogen atoms in triplet state , too .",
    "according to @xcite study of deuteron spin - dependent scattering amplitude allows , among other things , to investigate real part of nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "if a cell contains hydrogen atoms , then studying spin oscillation and rotation of hydrogen atom blowing by a flow of nonpolarized protons one can reconstruct real part of proton - proton scattering amplitude .",
    "thus , the above analysis shows that , as a result of coherent rescattering processes , a particle in a gas cell undergoes action of effective quasimagnetic and quasielectric fields , formed by the flow of high energy particles .",
    "picture of energy levels splitting , necessary for analysis of behavior of particle spin , can be obtained from shrdinger equation for spin wave function of a particle ( [ shr_eq ] ) @xmath240    if a particle beam flying at a proton ( deuteron , atom , molecule ) containing in a cell has non - zero polarization , then from general structure of scattering amplitude @xcite we can express @xmath130 as @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the magnetic moments of nuclei and electron shell of atom , respectively , @xmath244 + \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it should be emphasized that @xmath250 is amplitude of scattering by atom as a whole , therefore it includes both scattering by atom nucleus and atom electrons , @xmath251 is the spin of an atom .    it should be emphasized that in discussed experiment arrangement the effect of rotation and oscillation of spin of particles captured in a trap can exceed those investigated for high energy particles passing through a trap .",
    "this is caused by the following . in the first case",
    "( when we observe spin rotation of particles captured in a trap , see fig.[second ] ) density of particles in a trap @xmath252 can be quite low @xmath253 . as a result life - time of a particle beam rotating in a storage ring",
    "does not change .",
    "but in the second case ( when we observe spin rotation of high energy particles , see fig.[conventional ] ) the density of particles in gas cell should be rather high ( for example , @xmath254 ) to increase the effect value , but density growth yields to raising of multiple scattering by gas and , as a result , reduces life time of high energy particle in a storage ring .",
    "therefore , in the first case observation time can exceed that in the second case and effect can grow ."
