    "the ground - state ( gs ) structure of a magnetic nanosystem results from the competition between the interactions in the system . the energies of the exchange and dipolar interactions as well as the anisotropy energy and the energy of interaction of the magnetic moments with the external magnetic field must be taken into account in the energy balance while determining the gs .",
    "the combination of the frustration @xcite resulting from competing interactions and the boundary effects in nanoscale systems gives rise to unexpected phenomena @xcite . among the competing forces in two dimensions ( 2d ) , let us focus on the dipolar interaction which favors in - plane spin configuration , and the perpendicular anisotropy which tends to align spins in the perpendicular axis .",
    "the perpendicular anisotropy is known to arise with a large magnitude in ultrathin films @xcite .",
    "note that , in thin films with heisenberg and potts models , the competing dipolar interaction and perpendicular anisotropy causes a spin re - orientation transition at a finite temperature @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the case of a ultrasmall magnetic nanodot with heisenberg spins .",
    "four gs configurations have been observed in such nanosystems @xcite : ( i ) a capacitor - like state , ( ii ) a planar vortex , ( iii ) a vortex with core , and ( iv ) a domain structure .",
    "the conditions of formation of each structure have been determined @xcite with the size of the sample , the relation between the exchange and dipolar interactions , and the type of crystal order taken into account .",
    "systems in which the core vortex structure occurs hold much promise from the commercial point of view ; the occurrence of this structure has already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite by different imaging techniques . a major advantage of core vortex structures is the central region ( core ) of nonzero perpendicular magnetization , the polarization of which is stable at room temperature ( as shown by shinjo _",
    "interestingly , core magnetization reversal @xcite can be realized in two ways , by applying a strong magnetic field _",
    "perpendicular _ to the surface of the sample , or a short pulse of magnetic field _",
    "parallel _ to it .",
    "this property of magnetic nanodots opens the door to their application in magnetoresistive random access memory ( mram ) .",
    "the current development of a technology that allows to obtain nanosamples with a very strong perpendicular anisotropy @xcite has inspired us to investigate , with the use of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , the behavior of the core vortex structure , so interesting from the point of view of applications , under the impact of _ giant _ perpendicular anisotropy .    the purpose of this work is ( i ) to investigate the gs configuration in magnetic nanodots taking into account the short - range exchange interaction , the long - range dipolar interaction and the perpendicular anisotropy in 2d , ( ii ) to study the nature of the ordering and the phase transition at finite temperatures in such nanodots .",

    "the first summation runs over all the nearest - neighbor spin pairs @xmath13 , the second one over all the spins in the system , and the third one over all spin pairs . the dipolar energy is calculated from the expression included in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) without any numerical approximations ; in particular we do not introduce the cut - off radius , since this has been shown @xcite to affect quantitatively the calculation results in a sensible manner . in the following , @xmath6 is taken as a fixed parameter and is used as the energy unit ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the gs and thermal properties are calculated with varying @xmath2 and @xmath1 .    to find the gs of the system defined above we have used the simulated annealing method of the mc simulation class @xcite .",
    "the main steps of the procedure are :    \\(i ) to generate a random spin configuration , which corresponds to a high temperature phase of the system ,    \\(ii ) to update one by one all the spins as follows . at a lattice site",
    "we calculate the energy of its spin @xmath15 .",

    "the spins converge closer and closer to the gs with iterations .",
    "the above algorithm is thus a ",
    "slow cooling \" procedure which works rather well for small systems without strong bond disorder .",
    "another way to get the gs is to use the steepest - descent method : i ) we generate an initial spin configuration , ii ) at each lattice site we calculate the local field from other spins acting on that site , iii ) we align the spin of that site along the local field to minimize its energy , iv ) we take another spin and repeat step ii ) until all spins are considered , iv ) we iterate the procedure a large number of times until the convergence of the system energy to a minimum .",
    "in general , except for spin glasses , systems without strong bond disorder converges to the gs with a few dozens to a few hundred iterations @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this method gives the same results as those obtained from the simulated annealing shown in the following .      to investigate the evolution of the gs with growing anisotropy",

    "the next configuration , which occurs for @xmath2 greater than 1.87 , is characterized by satellite regions of perpendicular magnetization around the core ; the magnetization polarization in these regions is opposite to that in the core .",
    "finally , in its further evolution the system achieves a stripe domain structure , which forms above another threshold value , 2.37 , of the anisotropy parameter @xmath2 .",
    "thus , our simulations indicate that the stripe structure is the final configuration which the spin system seeks in the giant perpendicular anisotropy regime .",
    "this finding is easy to accept as with such a strong anisotropy all the spins are drawn out of the sample plane to set along its normal , i.e. @xmath38 . then the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) takes the form : @xmath39 which implies that the anisotropy term only shifts the system energy level ; for this very reason the number of stripe domains ( and their pattern ) at a given gs proves to depend only on the ratio @xmath40 , and not on @xmath2 .",
    "referring to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) , we can precisely indicate the ranges in which the stripe structure minimizes the system energy .",

    "spins are ordered in vortex configurations with out - of - plane core and corner spins which is a compromise between @xmath1 and @xmath2 effects .",
    "for very large @xmath2 , the energy is lowest when spins are perpendicular . in this situation ,",

    "in statistical physics , a phase transition is defined for systems at the thermodynamic limit where thermodynamic functions diverge or undergo anomalies .",
    "two often encountered types of phase transition are ( i ) the second - order transition where the second derivatives of the free energy , such as the specific heat and the susceptibility , diverge at the infinite system size , ( ii ) the first - order transition where the first derivatives of the free energy , such as the internal energy and the magnetization , have discontinuity .",
    "we can not theoretically define a phase transition for a finite - size system . in simulations and in theories",
    ", we can study finite - size systems but we use the finite - size scaling@xcite to predict the characteristics of the phase transition at the infinite - size limit . in nanodots with short - range interaction for instance , we can not talk about phase transition in the sense of the above definition : due to their very small sizes , the spins spend a finite time to reverse their orientation over and over again during the simulation time so that there is no stabilized ordering .",
    "however , in systems with long - range interaction where each spin is in interaction with all others as the dipolar case treated here , the ground - state ordering is due to the whole all - spin connection : exciting a spin costs an important energy amount , unlike in the short - range interaction case .",
    "as it turns out , the gs found above is stabilized at finite temperatures and is destroyed only at a higher temperature .",
    "we shall use the term  transition \" to indicate this change of ordering which is seen by the variation of the order parameter , even if this transition does not occur with a divergence of physical quantities since we work with nanodots .",
    "the dependence of physical quantities on the system size in the transition temperature region proves that the anomaly is indeed a phase transition if we let the system size go to infinity .",
    "we will return to this point below .",
    "a second point which is important to emphasize is the following .",
    "we know from the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite that systems of spins of continuous degrees of freedom , such as xy or heisenberg spins , with isotropic short - range interactions do not have long - range ordering at finite @xmath3 in 2d . our present model , though having a very small size , possesses the long - range interaction and an ising - like anisotropy , namely the two factors which favor the ordering at finite @xmath3 .",
    "we will see below that we have , even in the most unfavorable case with small @xmath2 , a sharp peak of the specific heat at the loss of vortex ordering at a finite @xmath3 .",
    "we use the standard mc simulation method which is enough for our purpose .",
    "the histogram method is used to detect first - order transition when necessary . in general , we discard about @xmath42 mc steps per spin for equilibrating and average physical quantities over the next @xmath43 mc steps per spin .",
    "we will concentrate ourselves in the following to the case @xmath21 with varying @xmath2 , for numerical presentation .",
    "note however that physical behaviors depend roughly on the ratio @xmath44 .",

    "<S> we study the effect of perpendicular single - ion anisotropy , @xmath0 , on the ground - state structure and finite - temperature properties of a two - dimensional magnetic nanodot in presence of a dipolar interaction of strength @xmath1 . by a simulated annealing monte carlo method </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in the ground state a vortex core perpendicular to the nanodot plane emerges already in the range of moderate anisotropy values above a certain threshold level . in the giant - anisotropy regime </S>",
    "<S> the vortex structure is superseded by a stripe domain structure with stripes of alternate domains perpendicular to the surface of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we have also observed an intermediate stage between the vortex and stripe structures , with satellite regions of tilted nonzero perpendicular magnetization around the core . at finite temperatures , at small @xmath2 , we show by monte carlo simulations that there is a transition from the the in - plane vortex phase to the disordered phase characterized by a peak in the specific heat and the vanishing vortex order parameter . at stronger @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a discontinuous transition with a large latent heat from the in - plane vortex phase to perpendicular stripe ordering phase before a total disordering at higher temperatures . in the regime of perpendicular stripe domains , </S>",
    "<S> namely with giant @xmath2 , there is no phase transition at finite @xmath3 : the stripe domains are progressively disordered with increasing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size effects are shown and discussed . </S>"
