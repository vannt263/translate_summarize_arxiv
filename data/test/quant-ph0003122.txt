    "of all the proposed technologies for quantum information processing devices , argueably one of the most promising and certainly one of the most popular is trapped ions .",
    "this scheme , discovered by ignacio cirac and peter zoller @xcite , and demonstrated experimentally shortly afterwards by monroe et al .",
    "@xcite , is currently being persued by about a half - dozen groups world - wide @xcite ( for an overview of this work , see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a vital ingredient of trapped ion quantum computing is the ability to cool trapped ions down to their quantum ground state by sideband cooling . using controlled laser pulses , the quantum state of the ion s collective oscillation modes ( i.e. the ions _ external _ degrees of freedom )",
    "can then be altered conditionnally on the _ internal _ quantum state of the ions valence electrons , and vice - versa .",
    "this allows quantum logic gates to performed .",
    "the current state - of - the - art ( as of spring , 2000 ) is that two groups have suceeded in cooling strings of a few ions to the quantum ground state @xcite , and that entanglement of up to four ions has been experimentally reported @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the quantum logic gates performed in trapped - ion quantum computers relies cruitially on the quantum state of the ions collective oscillatory degrees of freedom . in the original cirac - zoller scheme the ions must be in their quantum ground state of these degrees of freedom ( the quanta of which",
    "are widely referred to as phonons ) .",
    "if the purity of this quantum state were to be degraded by the action of external perturbations ( which , given the fact that ions couple to any externally applied electric field , seems quite likely ) then the fidelity of quantum operations naturally will suffer .",
    "the maintainance of the cold ions in their oscillatory quantum ground state seems at the moment to be the biggest single problem standing in the way of advancing this field .",
    "the solution is being tackled in two ways : firstly the understanding and nuffication of the experimental causes of the `` heating '' of the trapped ions , and secondly the investigation of alternative schemes for performing quantum logic operations which relax the strict condition of being in the quantum ground state of the phonon modes .",
    "this paper is a brief review and assessment of these schemes .",
    "the influence of random electromagnetic fields on trapped ions has been analyzed by various authors @xcite ; because this theory impacts on our later discussions , we will give a brief reprise of it here .",
    "consider @xmath0 ions confined in a trap .",
    "the trap is assumed to be sufficiently anistropic , and the ions sufficiently cold that they lie crystalized along an axis of the trap in which the effective trapping potential is weakest , which we shall denote as the x - axis . because the ions are interacting via the coulomb force , their motion will be strongly coupled .",
    "their small amplitude fluctuations are best described in terms of normal modes , each of which can be treated as an independent harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "there will be a total of @xmath0 such modes along the weak axis ( we will neglect motion along the directions of strong confinement ) .",
    "we shall number these modes in order of increasing resonance frequency , the lowest ( @xmath1 ) mode being the center of mass mode , in which the ions oscillate as if rigidly clamped together . in the quantum mechanical description ,",
    "each mode is characterized by creation and annihilation operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) . the ions are interacting with an extrnal electric field @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case is given by the expression @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 in eq.([up ] ) , @xmath8 is the @xmath9-th element of the @xmath10-th normalized eigenvector of the ion coupling matrix @xcite , @xmath11 being its resonance frequnecy , and @xmath12 is the component of the electric field along the weak axis of the trap . in what follows ,",
    "the center of mass phonon mode ( @xmath1 ) , whose frequency is equal to the frequency @xmath13 of the harmonic trapping potential , will have special importance .    the frequencies",
    "at which the externally applied fields are resonant with the ions motion is at most a few megahertz ; the wavelengths of such radiation will therefore not be less than 100 meters or so .",
    "the separation of the ions is of the order of 10 @xmath14 , or @xmath15 wavelengths .",
    "thus spatial frequencies in the applied field on the spatial scale of the ions separation will be very evanescent , and to a very good approximation one can assume @xmath16 , i.e. the field is constant over the extent of the ion string .",
    "using the fact that @xmath17 , the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the trapping frequency along the x - axis .",
    "in other words , spatially uniform fields will only interact with the center - of - mass mode of the ions , which is physical inituitive since some form of differential force must be applied to excite modes in which ions move relative to one another .",
    "the dynamics governed by this hamiltonian can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the  _ heating time_ , i.e. the time taken for the occupation number of the center of mass mode to increase by one , is given by the formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the root mean square value of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is its coherence time ( we have assumed that @xmath25 ) .",
    "the analysis of the heating of ions presented in the previous section is directly linked to the first , and conceptually most simple method for quantum computing with trapped ions in a manner which avoids the heating problem @xcite .",
    "quite simply the `` higher '' ( @xmath26 ) modes of the ions collective oscillations can be utilized in place of the center of mass ( @xmath1 ) mode originally considered by cirac and zoller .",
    "the pulse sequence required is exactly that proposed by those authors , with the slight added complication that different laser frequencies ( i.e. the sideband corresponding the stretch mode in question ) must be employed , and that the laser - ion coupling varies between different ions for the higher modes @xcite , requiring different pulse durations for different ions .",
    "however , as has been pointed out by saito",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( in the context of high - temperature nmr experiments ) the overall complexity of a computer algorithm involving _ classical _ control problems of this kind can nullify any speed - up that can be achieved via quantum parallelism .",
    "experimentally the `` higher '' modes of the two - ion system are observed to have heating times in excess of 5 @xmath27sec , as opposed to heating times of less than 0.1 @xmath27sec for the center of mass modes @xcite , confirming that they are indeed well isolated from the influence of external heating fields , and can be used as a reliable quantum information bus .",
    "the heating of the center of mass mode has an important indirect influence . as",
    "this mode becomes more and more excited , the wavefunction of the ions becomes more spatially smeared - out , causing a random phase shift of the ions .",
    "this effect is analogous to the debye - waller effect in x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "one possible solution for this problem has been proposed @xcite , namely the use of _ sympathetic cooling _ by a separate species of ion , allowing the excitation of the center of mass mode to be reduced and kept constant .",
    "this scheme however poses the problem of devising a method of loading a trap with an ion of a distinct species and providing a second set of lasers to cool it .",
    "the essential principle of the scheme proposed by poyatos , cirac and zoller @xcite for `` hot '' ion quantum computation is to create coherent states of the ions collective oscillations , rather than fock states .",
    "a laser pulse , appropriately tuned , flips the internal state of the ion and simultaneously provides a momentum `` kick '' to the wavepacket of the trapped ion _ in a direction which is dependent on the internal state of the ion_. thus if the ion / qubit is in state @xmath28 it will start to move off in one direction ; if it is in state @xmath29 it will start to move in the opposite direction .",
    "if it is in a superposition state , then a macroscopic entangled state ( or `` cat '' state ) will be created . because of the strong ion - ion coupling due to the coulomb interaction , a second ion will also evolve into two spatially dependent wavepackets dependent on the state of the first ion ( see fig.[fig1b ] ) .",
    "if the momentum kick imparted by the initial laser pulse is sufficiently strong then the wavepacket associated with the @xmath28 will , after a short time , be spatially distinct from that associated with the @xmath29 state . a laser",
    "may then be directed on that distinct wavepacket of the second ion , allowing its state to be changed dependent on the state of the first ion ( fig.[fig1c ] ) .",
    "once this is done , the motion of the wavepackets in the traps restores them to their original positions ( fig.[fig1d ] ) and a third pulse , reversing the effect of the first pulse and nullifying the momentum kick is applied to the first ion , completing the gate operation ( fig.[fig1e ] ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the traveling wave laser pulses which provide the momentum kicks are described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath30+h.a.\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath31 is the rabi frequency , which is proportional to the electric field strength of the laser ( see ref.@xcite for details ) and the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respecitively the lowering and raising operators for the internal states of the ion ( treated as a two level system ) . in paper",
    "will be considering the dynamics of one or two ions only , and the context should make it clear to which of the two ions the operators refer ; in some cases subscripts are appended .",
    "the constant @xmath34 is the lamb - dicke parameter , which characterizes the strength of the coupling between the laser and the oscillatory mode .",
    "it varies between different modes and , in general , from ion to ion .",
    "if this hamiltonian acts for a time @xmath35 then the resultant transformation of the state of ion 1 is @xmath36|\\phi\\rangle , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the _ displacement operator _ for the @xmath10-th phonon mode in question @xcite .",
    "the fact that all of the phonon modes are excited by this operation leads to somewhat complicated dynamics of the excited wavepackets .",
    "this is alieviated somewhat by the use of slightly different trapping potentials ( see @xcite for details ) , which may be realized in small scale traps , in which the electrodes are close to the ions ( which could have a detrimental effect on the heating of the ions . ) . as the number of ions increases this dynamics will becomes more and more complicated , so that one has to wait longer an longer times for the wavepackets to re - combine ( as in fig.[fig1d ] ) prior to completion of the gate .",
    "this is phenomnon unfortunately limits this scheme to no more than two or three ions .    in practice",
    "the ion wavepackets do not have to be _ completely _ separated spatially so that a laser can be focused on one but not the other ( as shown in fig.[fig1c ] ) ; so long as they are separated somewhat , a laser beam could be applied in such a fashion that one of the wavepackets had its internal states flipped while the other recieved a pulse of the same duration , but different intensity , contrived to leave the internals states effectively unaltered ( e.g. a `` @xmath38 '' pulse ) .",
    "care must however be exercised that laser fields are constant over the spatial extent of each wavepacket , otherwise spatial information will become inprinted on the internal degrees of freedom .    the finite temperature effects simply by increasing the size of the ions wavepackets . it derives its immunity from heating from the use of macroscopic effects ( i.e. the separation of the ions wavepackets ) which are effected but slightly by the heating .",
    "a possible source of decoherence would be differential heating , when the two spatially separated wavepackets of a single ion are excited by different random feilds , so that a mixed state of the internal degrees of freedom is created when the wavepackets are recombined .",
    "mlmer and srensen have proposed related techniques for creating both multi - ion entangled states @xcite and for quantum computation @xcite with ions in thermal motion .",
    "the scheme proposed in fact is valid for any mixed state of the ions collective oscillation modes , and is not confined to thermal equilibrium states .",
    "it relies on the virtual excitation of phonon states , in a manner analgous to the virtual excitation of some exited state of an atom or molecule in raman processes .",
    "laser fields with two spectral components detuned equally to the red and to the blue of the atomic resonance frequency are applied to a pair of ions in the trap .",
    "the interaction is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath39    in this equation @xmath40 is the detuning of the laser beam from the resonance frequnecy of the two level system . for large values of @xmath40",
    "it is convenient to consider this interaction in terms of an effective hamiltonian ( see appendix ) , which neglects the effects of very rapidly varying terms . in this case",
    ", the effective hamiltonian is @xmath41 + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{(\\delta-\\omega_{x } ) } \\left[\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{j}_{y},\\hat{j}_{y}\\hat{a}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{(\\delta-\\omega_{x } ) } \\left(\\frac{2\\omega_{x}}{\\delta+\\omega_{x}}\\right ) \\hat{j}^{2}_{y}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this interaction is equivalent to a conditional quantum logic gate preformed between the two ions , and can be used to create multiparticle entangled states .",
    "this scheme is very attractive because , while it has the possibility of being scalable to many ions , its operation is _ independent _ of the occupation number of the phonon modes , and so its fidelity is not degraded by excitation _ during _ the gate operations themselves .",
    "its chief drawback seems to be the time taken to perform gate operations . in @xcite",
    "an example is given of population oscillations associated with the above entangling operations in the presence of noise .",
    "the rabi frequency of these oscillations was approximately 4500@xmath13 ( c.f .",
    "fig.4 of ref.@xcite , with appropriate change of notation ) . given",
    "that trap frequencies must be of the order of @xmath42500 khz in order for the ions to be individually resolvable by focused lasers , this implies a gate time of the order of 50 milliseconds . as explained in ref.@xcite , it is possible to decrease this time by reducing the detuning @xmath40 of the laser , at the cost of increasing the susceptibility of this scheme to heating during gate operations .",
    "nevertheless mlmer and srensen s scheme is a very compelling idea , and has been used experimentally to create entangled states of multiple ions @xcite .",
    "the scheme proposed by schneider et al .",
    "@xcite relies on two operations : first the phonon - number dependent a.c .",
    "stark shift introduced by dhelon and milburn @xcite , and second the use of stimulated raman adiabatic passage to carry out certain kinds of transitions independently of the occupation number of the phonon mode used as a quantum information bus .",
    "@xmath46 + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{2(\\delta+\\omega_{x } ) } \\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^{(-)}\\hat{a } , \\hat{\\sigma}^{(+)}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx&-\\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{2\\delta } \\left(2\\hat{n}+1\\right ) \\hat{\\sigma}_{z}= -\\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{\\delta}\\hat{n}\\left(\\hat{\\sigma}^{(+)}+1/2\\right ) + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}}{2\\delta}\\left(\\hat{n}-\\hat{\\sigma}^{(+)}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{heffsara}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second term on the right hand side of the final equation represents a level shift , which can be compensated for by detuning the laser .",
    "if we choose the duration @xmath47 of this interaction to be @xmath48 , the time evolution is represented by the operator @xmath49 \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] this time evolution flips the phase of the ion when the cm mode is in an odd state and the ion is in its excited state , thus providing us with a conditional phase shift for an ion and the cm mode .",
    "this operation will be performed only on one of the ions ( the target qubit ) involved in the quantum gate ( which we denote by the subscript @xmath50 ) .",
    "operations acting on the second ion involved in the gate ( the control qubit ) will be denoted by the subscript @xmath51 .",
    "the adiabatic passage @xcite required for the gate operation can be realized using two lasers , traditionally called the pump and the stokes ( see fig.[adpass ] ) .",
    "the pump laser is polarized to couple the control qubit state @xmath52 to some second auxiliary state @xmath53 and is detuned by an amount @xmath44 . the stokes laser couples to the red side band transition latexmath:[$|2\\rangle_c    detuning @xmath44 .",
    "if the population we want to transfer adiabatically is initially in the state @xmath55 , we turn on the stokes field ( i.e.  the sideband laser ) and then slowly turn on the pump field ( i.e.  the carrier laser ) until both lasers are turned on fully",
    ". then we slowly turn off the stokes laser : this is the famous `` counter - intuitive '' pulse sequence used in adiabatic passage techniques .",
    "the adiabatic passage must be performed very slowly .",
    "the condition in our scheme is that @xmath56 , where @xmath24 is the duration of the adiabatic passage and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) are the effective rabi frequencies for the pump and the stokes transition , respectively @xcite . using the adiabatic passage we can transfer the population from @xmath55 to @xmath59 . to invert the adiabatic passage",
    ", we just have to interchange the roles of the pump and the stokes field .",
    "we will denote the adiabatic passage by operators @xmath60 and @xmath61 defined as follows : latexmath:[\\ ] ]    if we confine our interest to dynamics which are time - averaged over a period much longer than the period of any of the oscillations present in the effect hamiltonian ( i.e. averaged over a time @xmath80 ) then the oscillating terms may be neglected , and we are left with the following simple formula for the effective hamiltonian :            here is a list of groups either actively engaged on trapped - ion quantum computing that has come to the author s attention : nist boulder ( d.j .",
