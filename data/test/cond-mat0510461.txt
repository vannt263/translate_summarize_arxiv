    "bosonic atoms in an optical lattice are described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",

    "the last term accounts for a chemical potential @xmath6 .",

    "the average number of bosons is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of bosons and @xmath11 the total number of wells in the optical lattice . in the spirit of the tight - binding description we will call the wells henceforth ` sites ' . on the same site ,",
    "the bosons repel each other with interaction strength @xmath0 .    in the limit @xmath12 , a site with @xmath13 bosons contributes the energy @xmath14 . a deviation from uniform filling costs the energy @xmath15 . note that this excess energy results from the constant curvature of the parabola @xmath16 .",

    "it is energetically favorable to distribute the bosons uniformly and to put just @xmath13 bosons on each site .",

    "we will not address the inhomogeneity that is present in the experimentally realized traps , i.e. , we treat the system as translationally invariant though there is the slowly varying external trap potential .",
    "this approach makes quantitative computations much easier and it is backed by the recent finding that the inhomogeneous system acts essentially like two ( or several ) independent systems of different average number of bosons @xcite .    among the extensive literature on the bosonic hubbard model there are mean - field treatments , e.g.  refs .  , other analytical investigations , e.g.  refs . , and numerical treatments , e.g.refs .",

    "this entropy is present before turning on the optical lattice .",

    "the temperature is approximately @xmath60 , i.e. , of the same order as deduced by analysing recent spectroscopic experiments @xcite .",
    "this seemingly large value for the temperature is needed because the groundstate of the mott insulating phase at zero doping is separated by a large gap from the first excited states .",
    "the entropy has to be produced by the excited states which have an energy of the order @xmath0 .",
    "a small amount of doping leaves this temperature almost unchanged .",
    "but the system develops a finite entropy at zero ( and small ) temperatures .",
    "the reason for this is the degeneracy of the groundstate coming from the different possibilities to distribute @xmath10 bosons over @xmath11 lattice sites .",
    "the entropy at intermediate values of the temperature is only changed slightly .",
    "the temperature realized in the optical lattice is changed abruptly when the zero temperature entropy reaches the entropy value of the free bosons .",
    "then the temperature immediately jumps to zero .",
    "physically this corresponds to the situation where the whole entropy can be produced by the groundstate degeneracy of the doped mott insulator .",
    "thereby the temperature is reduced to the scale @xmath1 which is zero in the atomic limit .",
    "this is the mechanism which is most probably observed in the experiment in ref .  .",
    "it is more closely examined in the next part .    in the third temperature regime , the entropy of the free bosons is smaller than the entropy of the adiabatically loaded bosons at any temperature .",
    "this means that an adiabatic loading of the bosons into the optical lattice is not possible .",
    "instead , a non - ergodic mixture will be realized .",

    "hence we focus here on nearest - neighbor hopping so that we have a benchmark system which is simple to analyze .    in order to know which temperature",
    "is realized after adiabatic loading in the tg regime one needs to know the entropy of the non - interacting fermion gas . in one dimension",

    "the gibbs energy per site is ( @xmath43 ) @xmath63 where @xmath11 is the number of sites .",
    "the entropy per particle is calculated as @xmath64 in the limit of high temperatures the entropy per site is @xmath65 which is just the entropy of one state with occupation probability @xmath13 .",

    "additionally , the entropy per particle of the three - dimensional harmonic trap is plotted for condensate fractions @xmath57 as horizontal lines .",
    "this allows to determine the temperature that results for these condensate fractions after loading into the optical lattice in the tg regime . for half filling @xmath70 , the temperatures are @xmath73 for @xmath57 . also temperatures of multiples of the hopping parameter are possible , e.g. , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 the temperature is @xmath76 .",
    "again , the temperatures are of the size of the microscopic system parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this agrees well with the temperatures estimated in ref .. there , the temperature has been determined from the measured momentum profiles . for higher filling the entropy saturates at a lower value . for filling @xmath75 it does not rise up to the value of the harmonic trap for @xmath77 . thus in a process of adiabatic loading one",
    "can not achieve a filling of @xmath75 when starting with a condensate fraction of @xmath77 . within the tg regime ,",
    "even the highest temperatures are not sufficient to reach the necessary entropy . in practice",

    "are found in the tg regime .    by thermodynamic considerations , we found a physically relative simple and consistent picture . in the undoped mott insulator ,",
    "the temperature has to be of the order @xmath0 .",
    "the groundstate is a single state and does not provide any entropy .",
    "the initially present entropy has to be realized by excited states .",
    "this requires a large temperature of the order of the gap .",
    "the situation is different for the doped mott insulator .",
    "already at the energy scale of the hopping an appreciable amount of entropy is possible due to the finite amount of holes or particles .    in comparison to experiment ,",
    "an item still missing in our treatment is the inhomogeneity of the trap .",
    "so one might wonder whether our qualitative conclusions apply to the realistic systems .",
    "this question can be answered positively because it has been shown previously that the groundstate displays constant density plateaus at small values of @xmath17 @xcite . for zero or low temperature ,",
    "the realistic situation can be seen as an ensemble of homogeneous systems of various fillings @xcite .",
    "thus it is expected that our qualitative conclusions concerning the orders of magnitude of temperature remain valid even if the inhomogeneity of a wide trap is taken into account .",
    "the results were obtained on the one hand by considering limiting cases where a purely analytic treatment is possible and on the other hand by using a particle conserving cut at zero temperature extended by an approximate thermodynamics for hardcore bosons .",
    "for the cut the bose - hubbard hamiltonian is reformulated in terms of a reference state with exactly one boson per site and excitations above this state .",
    "this approach yields reliable results in a wide parameter regime of the mott insulating phase .",
    "results at finite doping were obtained by tuning the chemical potential in the approximate hardcore thermodynamics .",
    "the reference state was not adapted to finite doping , which may represent a way to improve the cut calculation .",
    "but we do not expect significant changes .",
    "we tested the reliability of the approximate thermodynamics for hardcore bosons by comparison to the exact results in the tg regime which are based on the mapping of the system to non - interacting fermions .",
    "we find that the approximation works well up to relatively low temperatures @xmath142 .",
    "we found that the approximate hardcore statistics corresponds to a classical description of the gas of hardcore particles .",
    "this results from the observation that the temperature below which the approximate statistics fails can be estimated to be the temperature at which the thermal de broglie wave length @xmath143 equals the interparticle distance .",
    "our considerations were restricted to one dimension because only in one dimension the hardcore bosons can be exactly mapped to fermions providing an easy - to - test benchmark .",
    "but apart from this generic one - dimensional feature used for the benchmark none of our arguments is restricted to one dimension .",
    "thus we expect that the qualitative findings presented in this paper apply also to higher dimensions .",
    "the obtained results provide a consistent picture of the role of temperature for bosons in one - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "we found that different physical situations can produce rather different temperatures .",
    "it is important in future experimental and theoretical works to take the influence of temperature into account in order to explore new quantum phenomena in the field of ultracold atoms .",
    "our basic finding is that a restricted phase space at low energies leads inevitably to a relatively large temperature when the system is reached adiabatically from a bose - einstein condensate with a condensate fraction which deviates from unity .",
    "one obvious means to reach lower temperatures is to realize condensates with less entropy , i.e. , with a higher condensate fraction @xmath58 at lower temperature .",
    "let us , however , suppose that this route can not be used to reach the desired very low temperatures which are , for instance , necessary to perform reliable quantum computations .",
    "in such a case , we like to propose an alternative route .",
    "the system with very restricted phase space at low energies should be brought into weak thermal contact with another system in the optical trap which has a large phase space at low energies .",
    "elementary thermodynamics tells us that the temperatures of both systems will finally become equal .",
    "this means that the system with large phase space cools the wanted system with small phase space down to low temperatures .    in the realm of bosons loaded in optical lattices",
    "this proposal means that one system should be realized which corresponds to a mott insulator and which remains at relatively high temperatures in the adiabatic process because it does not have phase space below its gap .",
    "this mott insulator can be cooled by a system which is in the tg regime , i.e. , in the doped mott insulating regime , with small hopping amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "the tg system can accommodate for an appreciable amount of entropy even at low temperatures .",
    "thus it is well - suited to cool the other system .",
    "we can not devise an experimental system which realizes the above idea .",
    "the use of two different laser systems in spatial vicinity for the same kind of atoms is certainly cumbersome .",
    "so it might be more promising to use two kinds of atoms in the same optical trap .",
    "the control parameters for the first kind of atoms should be such that it becomes mott insulating upon loading into the optical lattice .",
    "the second kind should enter the tg regime upon loading .",
    "it is most challenging to see to how low temperatures a bosonic mott insulating system can be pushed in such a way .",
    "fruitful discussions are acknowledged with a.  luchli , t.  stferle , i.   bloch , s.  dusuel , and e.  mller - hartmann .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg in sfb 608 and in sp 1073 .",
    "this appendix provides the derivation of the approximate gibbs energy of hardcore particles used in sect .",
    "[ sec : cut ] .",
    "the calculation adapts the reasoning in ref .   for triplets in a spin ladder to the present hardcore excitations .",
    "the relevant excitations are independent particle and independent hole excitations .",
    "multiple correlated @xmath89 and @xmath88 excitations and excitations of @xmath20-type are less relevant because of their higher energy .",
    "therefore , we will neglect @xmath20-excitations and correlated excitations of more than one particle or hole in the following .",
    "to use the non - interacting boson statistics for hardcore particles is a bad approximation because non - interacting bosons have no restriction on the occupation number .",
    "an incorrect number of states would contribute in the partition sum .",
    "the idea is to reweight all contributions to the partition sum such that they contribute the correct amount of entropy .",
    "therefore we have to calculate the correct number of states with particle and hole excitations .",
    "the number of possibilities to distribute @xmath144 truly bosonic excitations on @xmath145 sites is @xmath146 but the correct number of possibilities of @xmath144 hardcore excitations of two kinds reads @xmath147 to obtain the correct entropy for each number of excitations the @xmath144-boson part in the partition sum is reweighted by the factor @xmath148 . by this means",
    ", the partition function displays the correct high and low temperature behavior .",
    "the boson partition function for a system with @xmath11 sites and @xmath144 bosons is @xmath149 the sum runs over all multi - indices @xmath150 of @xmath151 momenta for particles at the momenta @xmath152 and holes at the momenta @xmath153 . here , @xmath154 is the energy of a particle with momentum @xmath155 , @xmath156 the energy of a hole with momentum @xmath157 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath6 is accounted for by @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the negative sign in the definition of the chemical potential @xmath160 for holes results from the fact that adding a hole means removing an original boson .",
    "the boson partition function eq .",
    "[ eq : boson : smallpf ] contains @xmath161 terms .",
    "thus the reweighted partition function reads      where we used the definition @xmath163 for the partition function of the single modes with @xmath164 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath6 is determined by specifying a certain filling .",
    "for instance ,",
    "for the filling @xmath18 the chemical potential @xmath6 is determined such that as many particles as holes are excited .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "[ eq : boson : pf ] is only an approximation to the correct hardcore partition function because it contains contributions from states that are only allowed for non - interacting bosons , but are forbidden for hardcore bosons .",
    "the correct contribution of each subspace of fixed total number @xmath144 of excitations is ensured only in an overall manner by reweighting the total subspace .    using the final expression ( [ eq : boson : pf : final ] )",
    "one can compute the gibbs energy per site @xmath165 to be @xmath166 equations  [ eq : bose : kleinepartfu ] and [ eq : bose : freeenergy ] are the formulae used in sect .",
    "[ ssec : finitet ] .    the toy model discussed in sect .",
    "[ ssec : test ] includes only holes as possible excitations .",
    "thus the gibbs energy depends only on one partition function of a single mode @xmath167 .",
