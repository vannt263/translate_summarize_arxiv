    "hadronic processes with a hard scale involved constitute an indispensable tool for probing the qcd dynamics of quarks and gluons , and through the qcd factorization theorems @xcite that separate physics at small and large distances , one may also study the dynamics of soft processes with small momentum transfers . hard quark and gluon interactions at small distances",
    "are thus not affected by soft interactions and are described in perturbative qcd .",
    "the most problematic part of the process is soft interactions at large distances , where nonperturbative qcd comes into the game and manifests itself as the confinement of quarks and gluons in hadrons and the related hadronization process giving the observable hadronic final states in high energy collisions .",
    "diffractive processes are sensitive to the details of nonperturbative qcd dynamics and provide a way to probe the soft and semihard regimes directly .",
    "diffractive events are characterized by a leading `` target '' particle , carrying most of the beam momentum , and a well separated produced hadronic system .",
    "the `` gap '' in between is connected to the soft part of the event and therefore to nonperturbative effects at a long space - time scale .",

    "proton collisions involves hard scattering events where , in spite of the large momentum transfer @xmath1 from the electron , the proton emerges essentially unscathed with small transverse momentum , keeping almost all of its original longitudinal beam momentum ( for reviews on ddis , see e.g. refs .",
    "the leading proton is well separated in momentum space , or rapidity @xmath2 , from the central hadronic system produced from the exchanged virtual photon s interaction with the proton .",
    "thus , this new class of events is characterized by a _ large rapidity gap _ ( lrg ) void of final state particles .",
    "rapidity gaps in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) were discovered by the zeus and h1 experiments at hera @xcite , but the first discovery of hard diffraction was in @xmath3 collisions by the ua8 experiment @xcite .",
    "these processes had actually been predicted @xcite by combining regge phenomenology for soft processes in strong interactions via pomeron exchange , with hard processes based on perturbative qcd . by parametrizing the parton content of an exchanged pomeron ( or alternatively diffractive parton density functions ) it is possible to describe the hera data .",
    "however , the extracted parton densities are not universal , since when used to calculate diffractive hard scattering processes in @xmath4 collisions at the tevatron one obtains cross sections an order of magnitude larger than observed .",
    "schematic illustration of the mechanism for diffractive deep inelastic scattering considered in this paper , with soft gluon exchanges in the final state.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    an alternative dynamical interpretation of hard diffraction was proposed in refs .",
    "this soft color interaction ( sci ) model is based on the simple assumption of soft gluon exchanges leading to color rearrangements between the final state partons .",
    "variations in the topology of the confining color fields lead to different hadronic final states .",
    "the sci model is implemented in monte carlo event generators , e.g.  lepto for dis @xcite .",
    "the hard part of the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddis - cartoon ] is then calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd with dglap evolution of the parton showers in the same way as in inclusive dis .",
    "the large momentum transfer means that the hard subprocess occurs on a spacetime scale much smaller than the bound state proton and is thus `` embedded '' in the proton .",
    "the emerging hard - scattered partons propagate through the proton s color field and may interact with it .",
    "soft exchanges will dominate due to the large coupling and the lack of suppression from hard gluon propagators .",
    "therefore , the momenta of the hard partons are essentially undisturbed  the soft , long distance interactions do not affect the hard , short distance process , and the momentum transfer of the soft exchanges can be neglected .",
    "however , the exchange of color changes the color charges of the emerging partons such that the confining string - like field between them will have a different topology , resulting in a different distribution of final state hadrons produced from the string hadronization  @xcite . in particular , a region in rapidity without a string will result in an absence of hadrons there , i.e.  a rapidity gap .",
    "the only parameter of this model is the probability for a soft exchange , accounting for the unknown nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "remarkably , the sci model is phenomenologically very successful in describing many different processes , both diffractive and nondiffractive @xcite , with only a single parameter @xmath5 for this probability .",
    "thus , the sci model captures the essential dynamics of diffraction , but lacks a solid theoretical basis .    to understand better what we can learn from the phenomenology of the sci model , we present in this paper a detailed qcd - based mechanism for soft gluon rescattering of final state partons , as illustrated in fig .

    "the reason is that there is no data from inclusive dis or other processes that can measure the gluon density directly in this domain .",
    "this gluon pdf uncertainty strongly affects the calculated diffractive structure function at small quark fractions @xmath32 and/or small @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where @xmath138 may drop below @xmath377 gev . in this case",

[ fig : rg ] for different pdfs . as can be seen , using either the typical leading order cteq6l1 pdf  @xcite , which decreases at small @xmath40 and @xmath138 , or the more regular but older grv94ho pdf  @xcite ( see comparison in fig .",

    "the soft factor is quite stable at @xmath381 .",
    "however , at @xmath372 , the diffractive cross section calculated with cteq6l1 is underestimated by almost an order of magnitude , and in order to get the correct normalization the fitted @xmath370 value grows significantly .",
    "this is mostly because of the strong suppression in cteq6l1 at small @xmath382 at scales @xmath383 . in contrast , the fit with grv94ho , which does not decrease at small @xmath40 , leads to a more stable behavior at low @xmath1 , such that @xmath370 essentially becomes an overall normalization constant close to unity .    in order to illustrate how uncertainties in the pdfs and in the ugdf prescriptions affect the @xmath40-dependence in comparison with data",
    ", we compare our model to the data using both cteq6l1 and grv94ho in the ugdf prescription of eq .",
    "( [ ugdfsat ] ) .",
    "this is our `` normal '' prescription that gives a linear dependence of the cross section on the gluon density . for comparison",
    "we also use cteq6l1 with the `` old @xmath162''-prescription defined in eq .",
    "( [ ugdfrg ] ) , which makes the cross section depend on the square of the gluon density .",
    "[ fig : pdfvsdata ] shows the results in the bins of interest with small scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the `` old @xmath162''-prescription leads to an order of magnitude too small diffractive structure function at all @xmath1 , which can not be explained by the expected normalization factor @xmath162 of order unity in eq .",

    "the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfvsdata ] have therefore been normalized in order to compare the @xmath40-slopes .",
    "these slopes are in reasonable agreement with the data , but there is a tendency for a too large curvature generated by the squared gluon density , in particular at large @xmath1 .    for the curves with linear gluon density",
    ", the curves with grv94ho lead to better slopes at the smallest @xmath1 and @xmath0 than those with cteq6l1 , but at higher scales they become too steep and can not describe data .",
    "this is not surprising since the old grv parametrization from 1994 does not take into account later data from hera and elsewhere , but it provides an interesting alternative due to its more regular behavior at very small @xmath364 at low scales .",
    "the curves fitted with the recent cteq6l1 parametrization have better @xmath40-slopes at higher scales and this is therefore the main alternative in fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] , in spite of its shortcoming at the very lowest @xmath40 points .",
    "the remaining free parameter to discuss is @xmath83 , the effective mass of the quark and antiquark in the @xmath30-system which is used in kinematical relations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : meff ] we show fitted values of @xmath83 at different scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the diffractive cross section itself is not very sensitive to @xmath83 , which therefore only varies within the physically reasonable interval @xmath384 gev .",
    "thus , it is mostly of nonperturbative nature and can be interpreted as a constituent quark mass .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath83 depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , indicating that both scales contribute to generating softer gluon radiation .",
    "this dependence is , however , non - trivial .",
    "indeed , a larger invariant mass @xmath0 provides a larger phase space , which may accumulate more soft collinear gluons , leading to a larger effective quark mass . on the other hand , a harder photon ( large @xmath1 )",
    "can probe a quark at smaller distances , so the @xmath1-dependence of the quark mass obeys renormalization group evolution , i.e.@xmath83 should decrease at larger @xmath1 .",
    "these two effects are indeed observed in the description of data ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : meff ] ) for @xmath385 gev . at larger @xmath0",
    "the situation changes somewhat due to more hard gluon radiation contributing to @xmath0 ( in particular , the @xmath7 contribution becomes important ) .",
    "we now investigate the role of the different contributions to @xmath386 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sigma ] ) , i.e.   @xmath6 from longitudinally and transversely polarized photons and the @xmath7 contribution . in our results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : data ] and  [ fig : pdfvsdata ] above , they are all included .",
    "we find , however , that the leading order @xmath6-dipole contribution dominates in all bins of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and is enough to describe all data for @xmath387 , below which the @xmath7 contribution becomes significant and can be approximated with its leading part calculated via dglap splitting of the first , hard gluon .",
    "[ fig : bspecr ] shows the @xmath26-spectra for the different contributions .",
    "they all vanish in the limits of @xmath388 , corresponding to large @xmath0 , and @xmath21 , corresponding to small or vanishing @xmath0 with production of resonances , which is not taken into account here , or no available phase space .",
    "the transverse @xmath6 contribution dominates over the other contributions .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath6 contribution is always small , although it becomes slightly larger at smaller @xmath1 scales .",
    "the gluonic @xmath7 contribution becomes relatively larger both at high @xmath1 and small @xmath26 , where it gives an important contribution that must be taken into account .",
    "we have in this paper developed a proper qcd framework for diffractive hard scattering , which contains both hard and soft dynamics .",
    "the hard part produces a well - defined state of emerging partons , and the soft part is the rescattering of these partons with the color field of the proton remnant .",
    "we have demonstrated that , by taking the fourier transform from momentum space to impact parameter space , the overall amplitude can be factorized into separate amplitudes for these hard and soft parts .",
    "this provides a substantial simplification for the calculation and is consistent with the physical insight that soft , long distance processes can not affect the hard process occurring on a short distance scale .",
    "the hard part is calculated using perturbative qcd , in the same way as for inclusive dis .",
    "a perturbative hard scale is provided by the photon virtuality @xmath1 and invariant mass @xmath0 of the diffractive system , and the process thus occurs at a space - time scale much smaller than the proton size . for small @xmath364 , the hard subprocess @xmath389 dominates .",
    "this process is mediated by a single gluon exchange taking most of the longitudinal momentum transfer , and leaves a proton remnant consisting of the three valence quarks in a color octet state .",
    "the proton remnant carries most of the beam momentum , and is therefore well separated in rapidity from the @xmath37 system .    the soft part of the amplitude accounts for the rescattering of the @xmath37 pair ( in a color octet state ) with this remnant .",
    "this rescattering is dominated by multiple exchanges of soft gluons , which have larger couplings and less propagator suppression .",
    "the result is a negligible change of the momenta of the emerging partons , but an important change of phase is picked up  this is the essence of the eikonal approximation .",
    "we find that summing over an arbitrary number of exchanged gluons leads to exponentiation of the soft amplitude , which can be written in a closed analytic form free of infrared divergences .",
    "the color exchange , treated in the large-@xmath58 approximation , leads to an overall color singlet exchange between the @xmath6 dipole and the proton .",
    "these two color singlet systems then hadronize independently separated by a gap in rapidity as characteristic signature of diffractive scattering .    by invoking physical considerations based on the uncertainty principle , which limits the possible resolution of small momentum transfers ,",
    "we obtain simplifications of the otherwise complicated angular relations in the impact parameter space .",
    "in essence , the orientation of the @xmath37-dipole relative to the proton color field is physically irrelevant and can be averaged out .",
    "in addition to the leading order contribution from the @xmath37-dipole , we have also included the next - to - leading contribution @xmath390 with an extra gluon in the final state . here",
    ", we find that the most important contribution is emission of this gluon from the exchanged hard gluon ( in @xmath389 ) , which can be well approximated by leading logarithmic dglap emission .    numerical evaluation of the analytical results gives good agreement with the precise hera data on the diffractive deep inelastic cross section .",
    "the @xmath37 contribution is indeed dominant , but at @xmath391 , the @xmath390 contribution is important . at very small @xmath382 and",
    "scales @xmath392 gev@xmath376 the gluon density in the proton , which is used as input in our calculation , is very poorly known and gives a complication in the comparison with the few hera data points in this extreme region .",
    "standard up - to - date parametrizations have a too low gluon density in this @xmath393 region , whereas , e.g. , the old grv94 gluon density does better .",
    "since the diffractive cross section depends directly on the gluon density , and not only indirectly via dglap evolution as for inclusive dis , one here obtains an interesting possibility to constrain the gluon density at very small @xmath364 .",
    "having demonstrated that our theoretical formalism for ddis does describe hera data , one may then extract the part describing the multigluon exchange process and apply it to other hard scattering processes .",
    "this soft rescattering description ought to be universal , due to the factorization of the hard and soft amplitudes .",
    "thus , one may apply it together with hard processes in @xmath3 collisions at the tevatron to describe the different hard diffractive processed observed there , and then go to the higher energies at the lhc .",
    "one may also apply it to more detailed observables in diffractive dis , such as diffractive dijets or diffractive vector meson production .    however , not only diffractive processes are of interest .",
    "the soft color interaction ( sci ) model discussed above has previously been successfully applied to both charmonium production and @xmath394-meson decays  @xcite , and one may expect the model presented in this paper to have interesting applications in such processes too . moreover",
    ", the multi - gluon exchange mechanism will also affect the underlying event , since it effectuates color exchanges that modify the color - string topology and thereby the hadronic final state after hadronization .",
    "the underlying event is important in its own right to understand non - perturbative qcd dynamics , and also for understanding of inclusive events when subtracting the standard model background in searches for new phenomena at lhc .",
    "finally we note that in deriving the theoretical formalism presented here , we have _ not _ used any assumptions or results from the previous soft color interaction ( sci ) model .",
    "our new formalism stands on its own , based on qcd theory and basic physical arguments .",
    "the formalism can , however , explain why the simple sci model has been so successful in describing data on diffractive hard scattering and other phenomena .",
    "the assumptions of the sci model as well as its major features are essentially what comes out as results of the present paper .",
    "of course , our new formalism has a richer dynamical structure and we will therefore attempt to improve the monte carlo implementation of the sci model by replacing its fixed probability for soft gluon exchanges with a mechanism based on the above amplitude for the multiple soft gluon exchanges .",
    "this will introduce a non - trivial dependence on the kinematical variables , giving a new level of event - to - event variations .",
    "as usual with full event simulation using monte carlo , this will give access to more detailed studies of both the employed theoretical model and its comparison to data in terms of the indicated more elaborate observables .",
