    "two observations of with the rosat pspc resulted in the detection of x - ray emission from 25 members of this old open cluster ( belloni et al .",
    "1993 , 1998 ) . the x - ray emission of many of these sources is readily understood .",
    "for example , the x - ray emission originates in deep , hot atmospheric layers in a hot white dwarf ; is due to mass transfer in a cataclysmic variable ; and is caused by magnetic activity in two contact binaries and several rs cvn - type binaries . however , belloni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) point out several x - ray sources in for which the x - ray emission is unexplained .",
    "all but one of these objects are located away from the isochrone formed by the main sequence and the ( sub)giant branch of ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the x - ray emission of these stars through low- and high - resolution optical spectra .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether the emission could be coronal as a consequence of magnetic activity , by looking for emission cores in the h&k lines .",
    "tidal interaction in a close binary orbit is thought to enhance magnetic activity at the stellar surface by spinning up the stars in the binary .",
    "therefore , we also derive projected rotational velocities with the crosscorrelation method .",
    "finally , we study the h@xmath0 profile as a possible indicator of activity or mass transfer .",
    "the observations and the data reduction are described in sect .  2 , and the analysis of the spectra in sect .",
    "comparison with chromospherically active binaries is made in sect .",

    "we give brief sketches of the stars studied in this paper ; details on many of them are given by mathieu et al .",

    "their orbital periods , 18.4 and 2.82 days respectively , are too long for them to be contact binaries ; also they are too far above the main sequence to be binaries of main - sequence stars . in principle , a ( sub)giant can become underluminous when it transfers mass to its companion , as energy is taken from the stellar luminosity to restore hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g.  kippenhahn &  weigert 1967 ) .",
    "however , mass transfer through roche lobe overflow very rapidly leads to circularization of the binary orbit , whereas s1063 has an eccentricity @xmath6 .",
    "the orbit of s1113 is circular , so mass transfer could be occurring in that system . for the moment ,",

    "was claimed by kurochkin ( 1960 ) , but this has not been confirmed by kaluzny & radczynska ( 1991 ) , who find variability with only 0.05 mag .",
    "s1063 is the only star in our sample that shows significantly variable x - ray emission ( between 0.0081 and 0.0047 cts s@xmath5 ; belloni et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "s1072 and s1237 are binaries with orbital periods of 1495 and 698 days , and with eccentricities @xmath8 and 0.105 , respectively .",
    "the colour and magnitude of s1072 can not be explained with the pairing of a giant and a blue straggler , since this is not compatible with its @xmath9 photometry ( nissen et al .",
    "1987 ; mathieu &  latham 1986 ) , nor with superposition of three subgiants , since this is excluded by the radial velocity correlations ( mathieu et al .",
    "the absence of the 6708   lithium feature in the spectrum of s1072 indicates that the surface material has undergone mixing ( hobbs &  mathieu 1991 ; pritchett & glaspey 1991 ) .",
    "s1237 could be a binary of a giant and a star at the top of the evolved main sequence ( janes & smith 1984 ) ; high - resolution spectroscopy should be able to detect the main - sequence star in that case ( mathieu et al .  1990 ) .",
    "the wide orbits and significant eccentricities appear to exclude both mass transfer and tidal interaction as explanations for the x - ray emission .",
    "s1242 has the largest eccentricity of the binaries in our sample , at @xmath10 in an orbit of 31.8@xmath11days .",
    "its position on the subgiant branch is explained if a subgiant of 1.25@xmath12 has a secondary with @xmath13 ( mathieu et al .",
    "k line emission is reported by pasquini &  belloni ( 1998 ) .",
    "photometric variability with a period of 4.88@xmath11days and amplitude of 0.0025 mag has been found by gilliland et al .",
    "we note that this photometric period corresponds to corotation with the orbit at periastron , which suggests that the x - ray emission may be due to tidal interaction taking place at periastron .",
    "the binary would then be an interesting example of a system in transition from an eccentric to a circular orbit .",
    "indeed , according to the diagnostic diagram of verbunt &  phinney ( 1995 ) a giant of 1.25@xmath12 with a current radius of @xmath14 ( as derived from the location of s1242 in the colour - magnitude diagram ) can not have circularized an orbit of 31.8days .",
    "s1040 is a binary consisting of a giant and a white dwarf .",
    "the progenitor of the white dwarf circularized the orbit during a phase of mass transfer ( verbunt &  phinney 1995 ) ; as a result the mass of the white dwarf is very low ( landsman et al .",
    "the white dwarf is probably too cool , at 16160@xmath11k , to be the x - ray emitter .",
    "indications for magnetic activity are h&k ( pasquini &  belloni 1998 ) and ( @xmath15 2800  , landsman et al .",
    "1997 ) emission lines .",
    "if the x - rays are due to coronal emission of the giant , this must be the consequence of the past evolution of the binary , since the giant is too small for significant tidal interaction to be taking place in the current orbit .",
    "s1082 is a blue straggler .",

    "( 1992 ) found eclipses with a total amplitude of 0.12 mag and a binary period of 1.07 days ; however , the radial velocities of the star do not show this period , and vary by about 2 km s@xmath5 , far too little for a 1day eclipsing binary ( mathieu et al .",

    "the level of their x - ray and emission is more appropriate for active main - sequence stars ( fig.[xca ] ) .",

    "we find no indication for a faint secondary in the crosscorrelation profile of s1237 ; at the time of observation , the spectra of two equally massive stars as suggested by janes &  smith ( 1984 ) would be separated by 4 to 7 km s@xmath5 ( derived from the ephemeris in mathieu et al .",
    "since the secondary is 1.6 magnitude fainter in v than the primary , we think that this small separation is compatible with finding a single peak in the crosscorrelation .",
    "s1242 is chromospherically active , as shown by its h&k emission .",
    "we suggest that this activity , which also explains the x - rays , is due to rapid rotation induced by tidal interaction at periastron , which tries to bring the subgiant into corotation with the orbit at periastron . if we assume that the observed period of photometric variability is the rotation period we derive an inclination of @xmath7 9@xmath74 using our maximum value of @xmath48 and the estimated radius",

    "1997 ) implies an equatorial rotation velocity of @xmath77 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is compatible with the velocity measured with our crosscorrelation , @xmath48 , for an inclination @xmath78 .",
    "this inclination has an a priori probability less than 0.5% ; and it implies an unacceptably high mass for the white dwarf , from the measured mass function @xmath79 .",
    "we conclude that the 8days period can not be the rotation period of the giant .",
    "it is doubtful that the white dwarf can be responsible , as its contribution to the @xmath2 and @xmath1 flux is small .",
    "the h@xmath0 absorption profile of the blue straggler s1082 is variable . if we consider the most symmetric spectrum profile , that of 00:01 ut , as the unperturbed profile of the primary , we find that the changes are due to extra emission .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ s1082 ha ] .",
    "we suggest that this variation is due to the subluminous companion , possibly to a wind of that star .",
    "we have also investigated the presence of a broad shallow depression underlying the d lines ( near @xmath72 5895  ) and the triplet ( near @xmath72 7775  ) as found by mathys ( 1991 ) .",
    "we find that this broad component is variable , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ s1082na ] .",
    "mathys ( 1991 ) suggests that the broad component originates in the subluminous companion .",
    "this companion outshines the primary by a factor six at @xmath72 1500  and thus is presumably hot ( landsman et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we note that the star can not be too hot or it would not show neutral lines .",
    "in this paper we have tried to find an explanation for the x - ray emission of seven sources in .    for s1242 and s1040",
    "we have concluded from the h&k emission cores that magnetic activity is responsible for the x - rays .",

    ", activity is likely to be triggered by interaction at periastron in the eccentric orbit .",
    "this is also reflected in the period of photometric variability . for s1040",
    ", the reason for activity is less clear .",
    "the explanation could involve mass transfer from the precursor of the white dwarf to the giant and the latter s subsequent expansion during the giant phase . as was already noted by landsman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a similar system is , a binary of a white dwarf of @xmath80 k ( simon et al .",
    "1985 ) and a g5iii giant in an 56.8 days circular orbit .",
    "the @xmath48 of that giant is also low , 4 km s@xmath5 , and the long photometric period of 77.2 days implies asynchronous rotation ( strassmeier et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity for is @xmath81 erg s@xmath5 in the 0.24 kev band as measured with einstein by walter &  bowyer ( 1981 ) , somewhat higher than the luminosity of s1040 .",

    "the h&k emission cores in s1063 and s1113 are very strong . in s1113",
    "we might even see emission of both stars .",
    "due to the shape of the h@xmath0 emission we can not conclude with certainty that the x - rays arise in an active corona and not in a disk or stream .",
    "the wings in the emission peak of s1113 are very broad .",
    "however , montes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have demonstrated that the excess emission in the h@xmath0 lines of the more active binaries is sometimes a composite of a narrow and broad component , the latter having a full width at half maximum of up to 470 km s@xmath5 .",
    "they ascribe this broad component to microflaring accompanied by large scale motions .",
    "we note the similarity between s1113 and , a well known extremely active binary of a g5iv ( @xmath48 = 13 km s@xmath5 ) and k1iv ( @xmath83 km s@xmath5 ) star in a 2.84 days circular orbit and a mass ratio 0.79 ( strassmeier et al . 1993 ) ; the mass ratio of s1113 is 0.70 ( mathieu et al .",
