    "over the last century , the _ einstein s theory of gravitation _",
    "i.e. general relativity ( gr)@xcite has been extremely successful to understand various observational facts like gravitational redshift , the precession of mercury s orbit , the bending of light etc . on the other hand , various black hole spacetimes with or without rotation were obtained as exact solutions of einstein field equations in gr namely schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "other black hole spacetimes including charges and rotations have also been discovered . though gr has enjoyed the great success , but it is still not a complete theory to understand the physics at sufficiently smaller length scale e.g. near the spacetime singularity which arises in case of gravitational collapse @xcite . in the vicinity of the spacetime singularity ,",
    "the quantum effects should be taken care of seriously and recently string theory has become the promising candidate for the same purpose which comprises gravity in the frame work of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "+ in continuation pursuit of the search for a quantum theory of gravity , the gauged supergravity theories @xcite have also captured considerable attention in recent times . in such models of gravity ,",
    "the maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravity is realized as truncation of string theory or @xmath1 dimensional m theory compactified on a sphere where the gauge group is the isometry group of the sphere . in particular , in @xmath2 correspondance @xcite , this gauge group becomes the r - symmetry group of the boundary cft which is related to the string theory on anti - de sitter space .",
    "black hole solutions in the @xmath3 sector have drawn much attention to understand strongly coupled gauge theory at finite temperature on the cft side @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the present work , we consider four dimensional charged black holes in @xmath4 is the number of supermultiplates .",
    "] , gauged supergravity upto four charges . the construction of these black holes have been explicitly performed in ref . @xcite and according to @xcite , such charged black hole congurations are termed as r - charged black holes . in gauged @xmath4 supergravity models ,",
    "the bosonic part of the complete lagrangian has a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 proportional to the square of the gauge coupling constant , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the @xmath3 length scale . ]",
    "@xmath8 @xcite and the black hole solutions are asymptotically @xmath3 .",
    "+ motivated from the study of motion of massless and massive test particles in the background of various black holes in gr @xcite and other alternative theories of gravity like string theory @xcite , we try to make an attempt to understand the geodesics of massive neutral as well as massless particles in the exterior region of such r - charged black holes .",
    "such investigations may indeed useful to capture the effect of cosmological constant in addition to the charges on the motion of the test particles .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study all the possible orbits of test particles in these class of spacetimes .",
    "we analyze the equivalent one dimensional effective potentials in order to study the geodesics equations of motion of the test particles in r - charged black holes background . on the other hand",
    ", we also focus our study on the various parameters ( mass parameter , multiple charge parameters and gauge coupling constant ) of the solutions and present various possible orbits by tuning those parameters . due to the presence of four non zero charges ,",
    "the form of the one dimensional effective potentials are little complicated in our case .",
    "we mainly concentrate on the numerical approach without performing the analytic solutions @xcite .",
    "the form of potentials can be retraced back to the known form in the limit of zero charges which otherwise takes quite nontrivial form .",
    "+ this paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss about the spacetime of our interest and the horizon structure of these particular class of r - charged black holes @xcite with multiple charges , whereas the ungauged situation ( i.e. @xmath9 ) is same as the schwarzschild black hole with flat asymptotes in gr . in section iii , we derive the geodesics equation and obtain the form of the effective potential . in section iv , we study geodesics equation of motion for massive neutral particles ( i.e. the timelike geodesics ) under one dimensional effective potential by considering different values of the parameters involved in .",
    "the radial and non - radial geodesics are studied analytically and otherwise numerically . using the effective potential techniques , the motion of test particles and the structure of corresponding orbits",
    "are discussed in greater detail . in order to have a complete analysis of the geodesic motion in the background of the abovementioned black hole spacetime",
    ", we also study the motion of massless test particles ( i.e. null geodesics ) in section v. finally , we conclude and summarize our results .",
    "we consider the following spacetime metric of four electric charge black hole solution in @xmath0 , @xmath4 gauged supergravity , @xmath10 where @xmath11 here @xmath8 is the gauge coupling and @xmath12 is the non - extremal parameter like mass term in pure schwarzschild black hole , @xmath13 can take three values i.e. @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , however in the present study , we consider only the case of black hole solutions with @xmath13 = 1 .",
    "the @xmath17 in eqs .",
    "( [ met1 ] ) and ( [ eq : f_n_h ] ) parametrizes the four electric charges .",
    "+ the scalar curvature @xmath18 for the above metric can be given as below , @xmath19 , \\label{ricci}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 .",
    "one can easily verify that for @xmath21 ( no charge solution ) , the scalar curvature @xmath22 , which is exactly same as that of an anti - de sitter schwarzschild black hole .",
    "+ let us first discuss about the event horizons of the metric eq.([met1 ] ) in presence of @xmath23 equal charges .",
    "so for @xmath23 equal charges with @xmath13 = 1 , equation ( [ eq : f_n_h ] ) reduces to , @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the lapse function @xmath27 vanishes at the zeros of the equation given as , @xmath28 the real and positive zeroes of eq.([eq : f_r ] ) are known as the horizons for the corresponding spacetime .",
    "hence if a spacetime represents black hole @xmath27 should vanish at some positive value of @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath23 = 1 , 2 , 3 , there is always a cubic equation for @xmath29 while for @xmath23 = 4 , we have a quartic equation for @xmath29 . the roots of eq.([eq : f_r ] ) in a closed form are really lengthy and complicated , so are not discussed over here , rather we present the graphical presentation of the position of the horizons by imposing certain conditions among the parameters of the black holes . in presence of one and two equal charges",
    "one will always have a horizon as shown in the fig([horizon_1_4]@xmath30 ) for various values of @xmath31 and @xmath8 . while in presence of three and four equal charges , there are some constraints on the parameters involved in the metric to represent a black hole with at least one horizon . in presence of three equal charges ,",
    "the constraint on parameters for the presence of horizon is given by , @xmath32 the three type of plots in fig([horizon_1_4]@xmath33 ) or ( [ horizon_1_4]@xmath27 ) clearly explain the facts that black curve does not satisfy the bound eq.([eq : condition_bh_3q ] ) with the values of parameters chosen .",
    "so it is obvious that there is a possibility of naked singularity in case of three equal charges if one crosses the bounds given in eq.([eq : condition_bh_3q ] ) . in case of four equal charges present ,",
    "the condition of getting at least one horizon is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , + and @xmath36 .",
    "+ the zeros of the function @xmath37 are presented in the plots of fig([horizon_1_4]@xmath38 ) . in fig([horizon_1_4]@xmath8 ) , one can see that for sufficiently small values of the constant @xmath8 the number of zeros for @xmath37 changes . for certain values of @xmath31 ,",
    "one will get two zeros of the function @xmath37 whereas smaller than that two zeros merge into a single zero and larger than that real zeros will disappear completely by leaving with a naked singularity as explained in @xcite .",
    "the same arguments are also plausible when the constant @xmath8 varies keeping charge parameters @xmath31 fixed , as shown in fig([horizon_1_4]@xmath39 ) .",
    "one can simplify metric given in eq.([met1 ] ) by choosing @xmath40 , to restrict the motion of the particles in the equatorial plane i.e. we restrict ourselves to study of the equatorial geodesics .",
    "+ using the following geodesic equation @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where dot denotes the derivative with respect to proper time @xmath45 . + for a timelike geodesics @xmath46 , @xmath47 from the constant of motion , the first integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ time ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) result as , @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the integration constants which represent the conserved energy and angular momentum of the test particles respectively .",
    "+ using eqs.([com1 ] ) and ( [ com2 ] ) , one can now rewrite the timelike constraint eq.([timelike ] ) in the following form , @xmath52 the effective potential for timelike geodesics may be identified from eq.([eom ] ) as , @xmath53 one can reproduce the effective potential for the schwarzschild black hole with @xmath3 asymptote as a limiting case when @xmath21 .",
    "it seems that under scaling of the metric components like @xmath54 and @xmath55 , one can exactly write down all the corresponding equations above for the case of a schwarzschild black hole in flat space @xcite . however , the effective potential for null geodesics is given as , @xmath56 the difference in the nature of effective potentials for both the cases as given in eq.([eq : potential_non_radial ] ) and eq.([eq : potential_non_radial_null ] ) manifests itself in the structure of orbits as presented in the later sections .",
    "from effective potential given in eq.([eq : potential_non_radial ] ) for particles moving along the timelike geodesics , the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) is investigated for two cases : radial and non - radial geodesics in the following subsections , respectively .      for radial geodesic",
    "( with zero angular momentum @xmath51 ) , the effective potential given in eq.([eq : potential_non_radial ] ) reduces to the following form , @xmath58 the behaviour of effective potential is shown in fig.([fig : potential_01 ] ) for a particular set of parameters , considering all values of @xmath23 ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath59 .",
    "if the particle is released from rest at a distance @xmath60 , the initial energy of the particle is given as , @xmath61 so from the radial equation of motion , one obtains @xmath62 which can be integrated as , @xmath63        in order to know the proper time experienced by a particle falling from @xmath64 to coordinate radius @xmath29 , one needs to evaluate the integral given in eq.([eq : tau_integral ] ) .",
    "since the result in a closedform is not obvious here , we look for numerical solutions . the proper time given by eq.([eq : tau_integral ] ) is visually presented in fig.([fig : proper_time_radial ] ) which indicates that the particle falls towards the horizon in a finite proper time .",
    "it can also be observed from this figure that the proper time to reach horizon decreases with the increasing number of charges .",
    "here we study the timelike geodesics for incoming test particles with nonzero angular momentum .",
    "let us try to understand orbits of the particles in the background of the r - charged black holes by using the effective potential @xmath66 given by eq.([eq : potential_non_radial ] ) .",
    "for @xmath67 ( the horizon radius ) , @xmath68 and for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , whereas for @xmath69 , @xmath71 ( when @xmath9 ) .",

    "<S> we have discussed all the possible orbits in detail for different values of energy and angular momentum of the incoming test particles . </S>",
    "<S> the periods for one complete revolution of circular orbits and the advance of perihelion of the planetary orbit have also been investigated in greater detail for massive test particles . </S>",
    "<S> we have also discussed the time period of unstable circular motion and cone of avoidance of massless test particles in detail . </S>",
    "<S> all the corresponding results obtained for massive and massless test particles are then compared accordingly . </S>"
