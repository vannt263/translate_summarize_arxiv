    "in this paper we will give a treatment of an sis infection model in a population partioned into households .",
    "our main emphasis will be the use of a method borrowed from statistical physics , the self - consistent field ( scf ) technique .",
    "the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model is one of the basic themes in mathematical epidemiology @xcite . in this idealization of the spread and persistance of an infection ,",
    "@xmath2 individuals are initially either susceptible , @xmath3 , or infected , @xmath4 .",
    "each one of the infected is coupled to a certain number of other agents .",
    "each @xmath4 infects all of the @xmath3 with which it has contact with a rate @xmath5 , and each @xmath4 recovers with rate @xmath6 , and immediately becomes susceptible again .",
    "schematically , we can write : @xmath7 clearly , at long times the system might achieve an equilibrium where the number of infected fluctuates around a mean .",
    "we characterize this state by denoting the mean fraction of population which is infected by @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes a time average .",
    "we refer to this quantity as the endemic level .",
    "the model is defined by the two parameters , @xmath11 , and by the contact structure of the population .",
    "two cases of the latter have been studied in some detail . in the first ,",
    "each individual is equally coupled to all the others in a large population .",
    "this random mixing model is rather easy to treat , and a large number of results are known @xcite .",
    "for example , in the deterministic limit , @xmath4 obeys : @xmath12 where we have redefined @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath14 , and for any intial condition with @xmath15 , the epidemic goes to the endemic level , @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath17 the infection dies out .    in the second well - studied case",
    "the individuals are arranged in some geometric way and couple only to their nearest neighbors .",
    "this is called the contact process @xcite . in the last section of this paper",
    "we give numerical results on a model which interpolates between the two cases .",
    "ball @xcite introduced the sis household model , which puts more structure into the random mixing case by having two levels of mixing . in this idealization the population , @xmath2 , is partitioned into @xmath0 households with @xmath18 members .",
    "the infection rate within the household , @xmath19 , is different from that with individuals outside , @xmath5 .",
    "this followed work on sir models with similar structure @xcite .",
    "ball s results are for the case @xmath1 with fixed @xmath18 , that is , a large population of small households , which is clearly of practical interest .",
    "in this paper we extend ball s work from a different point of view inspired by techniques in statistical physics .",
    "these will be explained in the next section .",
    "briefly , the idea is that for random mixing and a large population , we can consider that each household is acted on by an average force of infection from outside .",
    "this is quite similar to methods used in the theory of magnetism @xcite , inspired by the work of p. weiss .",
    "weiss introduced the ` molecular field ' , which is proportional to the mean orientation of the neighbors of a given magnetic ion .",
    "the orientation of the ion itself is then determined , and the unknown molecular field is gotten by demanding that the neighbors have the same orientation .",
    "( note that this step assumes that there is no correlation between neighbors . )",
    "this step is known as self - consistency , hence the name , self - consistent field .",
    "as we will see , @xmath8 plays the role of the self - consistent field .",
    "the technique itself is called self - consistent field ( or sometimes mean - field ) theory .",
    "some of our results were already obtained in @xcite , e.g. , the expression for @xmath20 for households of size @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ thresh ] ) , below .",
    "other explicit results are new .",
    "we think that one of the main values of this paper is that this point of view allows us to look at the solutions in a new way , and gives considerable insight .    in the last section",
    "we continue the analogy to magnetic systems by doing numerical simulations for finite @xmath0 , and for systems where the random - mixing assumption is not valid .",
    "we find , as in magnetism , that the scf assumption is remarkably accurate in situations where we would expect it to fail .",
    "consider an sis epidemic in a population partitioned into @xmath0 households each consisting of @xmath18 individuals .",
    "we suppose that within a household the infection rate per contact is @xmath19 and between different households @xmath5 .",
    "we write @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "( in the notation of ball @xcite , @xmath22 ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath23 remains finite in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "the recovery rate is @xmath6 , and a recovered individual can be reinfected at once .",
    "we begin intuitively by considering the case @xmath25 and try to formulate the chapman - kolmogorov forward equations for the probability , @xmath26 , to have @xmath27 infected in a typical household : @xmath28 the terms in @xmath23 are the mean force of infection between households , and @xmath8 has the interpretation of the fraction of a typical household that is infected .",
    "the point is that the only communication between households is by infection , and for a large number of such contacts , only the average number of infected in the other households is important . in effect",
    ", we have assumed that the households are independent . note that @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the strategy for solving these equations ( in the steady state ) is to find the @xmath31 with @xmath8 as a parameter , and solve for @xmath8 self - consistently , using eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , at the end of the calculation .",
    "this is a heuristically appealing method . for magnetic models ,",
    "the approximation is exact in the case of infinite - range interactions ( in our case , all households interact equally with all others ) . even for short - range interactions ( i.e. , households interacting with a ` neighborhood ' ) the approximation is often surprisingly useful .    in fact , a rigorous proof of the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ p ] , [ f ] ) is available for this case as well .",
    "this is given by ball @xcite who uses the work of kurtz @xcite to prove the following : let @xmath32 be the number of households in the population with exactly @xmath27 infected . define @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath31 satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ p ] , [ f ] ) for any initial condition with finite density , i.e. , with @xmath34 not all equal to @xmath35 . in the last section",
    "we will investigate numerically how good this approximation is for finite @xmath0 and for finite range of interaction .",
    "we note , for later use , that we can give another interpretation to eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) .",
    "suppose we consider a single household with 2 individuals subject to a _ fixed _",
    "external force of infection .",
    "then we can think of @xmath31 as the probability to have @xmath27 infected . from standard results on stochastic processes",
    ", there is a unique steady - state solution to these equations for any positive @xmath36 .",
    "further , if @xmath37 the only steady - state solution is @xmath38 ; that is , the infection becomes extinct with probability unity .    in the general case the time evolution of the vector of probabilities @xmath39 ( @xmath40 denotes a column vector ) to have exactly @xmath27 infected in the household of @xmath18 ,",
    "is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a square tridiagonal matrix with nonzero elements @xmath43 \\label{elements } \\\\ m_{k , k\\quad } & = & -\\left [ k\\gamma + ( n - k)kw+(n - k)fb\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ m_{k , k+1 } & = & \\left ( k+1\\right ) \\gamma \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the equations again contain @xmath8 , the mean level of infection , as a parameter .",
    "@xmath45 for the reasons given above , these equations are valid in the limit @xmath46",
    ".    we will be interested in the stationary solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ timedep ] , [ fn ] ) .",
    "it is clear by inspection that there is always a trivial steady - state solution @xmath47 corresponding to extinction of the infection .",
    "we will find that above a certain threshold there is another solution , and we will show that when this occurs the trivial solution is unstable .      in the case @xmath48 it is a matter of simple algebra to find the steady - state solution : @xmath49    using eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) we get a cubic polynomial equation to solve for the endemic level , @xmath8 . after removing the trivial solution",
    "we have : @xmath50 the larger root of this equation is : @xmath51 this expression is acceptable , i.e. , positive , provided : @xmath52 thus eq . ( [ thres2 ] ) serves as a threshold condition for the existence of a non - trivial endemic level .    for @xmath53",
    "it is not difficult to find a cubic equation for @xmath8 analogous to eq .",
    "( [ quadeq ] ) ( in this expression we set @xmath54 , which sets the unit of time ) : @xmath55 by inspection @xmath56 . if @xmath57 then there is at least one root in the interval @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "( in fact , numerics shows that there are also two negative roots ) .",
    "thus if : @xmath59 we have a non - trivial solution , and otherwise all the roots of eq .",
    "( [ cubiceq ] ) are all negative , and only the trivial solution is acceptable .    in the general case we look for the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ timedep ] ) by setting @xmath60 .",
    "we get a homogeneous system of equations , from which the endemic level has to be established self - consistently . recall that @xmath29 , so that we can reduce the number of equations by one by eliminating @xmath61 .",
    "denote the vector of length @xmath18 , @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting system of equations for the stationary state is inhomogeneous .",
    "it reads @xmath63    the matrix @xmath64 is given by : @xmath65    the matrix @xmath66 is linear in @xmath8 : @xmath67 where both matrices , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath8-independent .",

    "eq.([ex ] ) can be rewritten : @xmath100 then we formally expand in a geometric series : @xmath101 multiplying both sides of eq.([iterat ] ) by @xmath102 we get the following equation for @xmath8 : @xmath103 where @xmath104 from which @xmath8 can be obtained with any necessary accuracy .",

    "we obtain an equation for the time evolution of the reduced probability vector @xmath78 : @xmath115 since @xmath78 depends on @xmath8 , eq.([temporal ] ) is a nonlinear equation describing the evolution of @xmath78 . in the previous section",
    "we have shown that this equation has two equilibria provided @xmath116 , where @xmath20 is defined in eq .",

    "recall that @xmath147 can be interpretated as @xmath148 where @xmath136 is the number infected in a household , and @xmath149 is the average over the distribution @xmath150 .",
    "if we calculate @xmath151 we get a measure of the fluctuation of @xmath136 in a household . in figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    "we show the standard deviation , @xmath152^{1/2 } = [ \\mathbf{n_2p } - ( nf)^2]^{1/2}$ ] as a function of @xmath23 for several @xmath19 s , for @xmath53 . in a similar way , in figures ( [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] ) we show @xmath8 and @xmath153 for @xmath142 and @xmath154 .",
    "the considerations in the previous sections apply in the limit @xmath24 . for any finite @xmath0",
    "the only steady - state solution possible is the trivial one , @xmath37 ; with probability unity the infection will become extinct .",
    "however , the time to extinction may be very long , @xmath155 if the system is above @xmath20 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for the case @xmath156 . for times short",
    "compared to the extinction time the system will be in a quasi - stationary state which resembles the infinite system .",
    "we have done preliminary investigations of this and related behavior using computer simulations .",
    "we represent the population as follows : imagine a population of @xmath0 households each containing @xmath18 agents arranged on a ring .",
    "all of the members of the same household can infect one another with probability / unit time @xmath19 .",
    "the communication with other households is variable range : we allow each household to infect all of the other households in a range @xmath157 on either side .",
    "see figure ( [ sketch ] ) .",
    "that is , the number of outside contacts is @xmath158 , and the infection probability is @xmath159 .",
    "the equivalent of the random mixing case of the previous sections is @xmath160 ; in this case all agents are coupled to each other .",
    "the case @xmath161 is the well - known contact process @xcite .    , @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "the white bonds represent contacts within a household .",
    "all of the inter - household contacts for one agent are shown in black , width=288 ]    our computer algorithm is quite simple : we suppose that @xmath164 are all less than unity .",
    "we start by marking a certain fraction of agents as infected , which establishes @xmath165 where @xmath4 is the total number infected in the population . for each computer time step",
    "we choose one agent , in household @xmath27 , at random among the infected , and find all the other agents that are coupled to the one in question",
    ". these will be in households with index @xmath166 , where the indicies are to be interpreted with periodic boundary conditions . with probability @xmath19 or @xmath159 ( depending whether the other agent is in @xmath27 or outside ) the other agent",
    "is infected .",
    "then another agent is chosen at random among the infected , and it is allowed to recover with probability @xmath6 .",
    "each computer time step corresponds to an increment of ` clock time ' , @xmath167 .",
    "a typical result for @xmath168 is shown in figure([sim ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this algorithm is quite fast  it is not difficult to treat as many as 3000 agents on a simple workstation .    in this section",
    "we will give a few results of the simulations .",
    "we have found that the scf is an excellent representation of the behavior in large systems with long - range interactions , but that for smaller systems and shorter ranges the approximation becomes poorer , but still surprisingly good .",
    "a systematic investigation of these effects will be reserved for a future publication : here we give a few preliminary results .    , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "the agreement for the average is essentially perfect , but for the fluctuations ( see text ) the scf method is an underestimate.,width=480 ]      for large enough @xmath0 the simulation results agree very well with the scf results . in figure([sim ] ) the average of the time series agrees almost perfectly with the results from the previous sections : the numerical average of the simulation data differs from the scf by less than the width of the line .",
    "in addition we can try to understand the fluctuations of the time series by the following reasoning : if we imagine that the different households fluctuate more or less independently ( this is the assumption under which the scf method is valid ) , then the standard deviation of the total should be @xmath172 . as we see in the figure , this is a good approximation .",
    "however , we have observed that there is a large finite - size effect for this statistic . for @xmath173",
    "the simulation result for @xmath174 is almost twice the prediction .",
    "another way to look at the standard deviation is to simply record the time series of the number infected in a given household , and directly find @xmath153 .",
    "we did this by averaging over 10 randomly chosen households in the system .",
    "we find very good agreement with the analytic treatment : for example , for @xmath175 we find @xmath176 .",
    "the analytic result is @xmath177 , well within our estimated error .",
    "as we reduce @xmath0 we find a surprising result : within the numerical accuracy of our simulation we can find no change in @xmath8 .",
    "rather , at a certain small size , @xmath178 for the parameters in the last paragraph , the infection dies before we can collect adequate statistics .      for the case of small @xmath157",
    "the scf ceases to be valid . in magnetic systems ,",
    "locality of the interaction is well known to increase fluctuations and to change the threshold .",
    "we find related effects here , but the range needs to be very small indeed for the scf result to be very inaccurate .    in figure ( [ fofl ] )",
    "we show simulation results for @xmath179 , the endemic level as a function of the range of the interaction between households , @xmath157 .",
    "we show three different sets of parameters for @xmath53 and compared with the scf ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the dependence is remarkable : for the parameter values ( @xmath181 ) , finite range has hardly any effect .",
    "the other two sets do show a decrease of @xmath8 , and an apparent shift in the threshold . for @xmath142 @xmath182 in the scf , well below @xmath183 however , for @xmath184 , the system is below threshold , and the epidemic dies quickly .",
    "a similar effect occurs for @xmath185 , which is below @xmath20 for @xmath186 .",
    "( for large @xmath157 , @xmath187 for these parameters . )",
    "another way to put this is that there is a characteristic length @xmath188 for these two sets of parameters .",
    ", as a function of the range of the infection contacts between households .",
    "the horizontal lines are the scf results for large @xmath157 . in all cases @xmath189 so that the maximum possible @xmath190,width=576 ]    these results are reminiscent of effects that occur in phase transitions in statistical physics .",
    "in fact , the contact process is fruitfully viewed as an example of a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "near the threshold ( i.e. the critical point ) of a continuous phase transition , the system develops a diverging correlation length . for total system sizes greater than this length finite size effects are small .",
    "thus we might guess that the correlation lengths for two of the sets of parameters could be of order @xmath191 .",
    "we have not investigated this matter in detail , but it would repay consideration .",
    "in this paper we have given a number of explicit results for the sis household model .",
    "our point of view was to emphasize the scf method as a guide to solution and insight .",
    "the numerical results give rise to a number of questions that are probably not accessible to rigorous proof , but for which numerical methods could be pursued .",
    "for example , we have speculated that there are critical fluctuations @xcite in this system .",
    "that would mean that near threshold there would be large correlations in adjacent households for a finite range system , a result that could be of considerable interest .",
    "there is also a practical aspect to this method .",
    "scf theory is quite flexible , and allows considerable complication to be added to the model without substantially increasing the complexity of the solution .",
    "suppose our household contains two types of members , for example , children who go to school and contract infections , and adults who do not .",
    "this would require a few changes : for a 3 person household with two adults and a child , the analog of the vector @xmath150 would be of length 6 instead of 4 , and the complete solution would be no worse than the numerical inversion of a @xmath192 matrix .",
