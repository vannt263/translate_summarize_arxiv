    "the monopole condensation is one of the most favored mechanisms of the confinement , for review and references see @xcite .",
    "still , there remain important unresolved questions concerning this mechanism .",
    "the main point is that the definition of the monopoles , which are abelian in nature , is not unique within a non - abelian theory . from pure phenomenological point of view",
    "the monopoles defined within the maximal abelian projection ( map ) seem to be most successful .",
    "monopoles within a particular gauge would not have been of much use if it were not so that they possess remarkable @xmath0 invariant properties . in particular , the density of monopoles in the percolating cluster scales as a physical quantity of dimension @xmath1 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that apart from the percolating cluster that fills in the whole of the lattice @xcite there exist also finite - size clusters .",
    "the percolating cluster is responsible for the confinement and we will concentrate here on its properties .",
    "a further and dramatic evidence for the reality of the map monopoles comes from measurements of the full , non - abelian action associated with the monopoles , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "namely , it turned out that at presently available lattices the action is large and ultraviolet divergent : [ uv ] s_mon  =  c_action(l / a ) , where @xmath2 is a constant , @xmath3 is the length of the monopole trajectory and @xmath4 is the lattice spacing . moreover , the @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ uv ] ) is close to @xmath6 which determines the entropy factor .",
    "it is well known that the physical mass , entering the propagator is proportional to the difference [ fine ] m^2_physa  ( c_action-7)/a .",
    "the two terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ fine ] ) cancel each other to a great extent and one can say that monopoles are fine - tuned @xcite .    these observation imply that at presently available lattices the monopoles appear not as extended field configurations but rather as geometrical , point - like objects .",
    "moreover , the monopoles are always observed as ( closed ) trajectory .",
    "therefore the use of the language of the polymer approach to field theory , or of quantum geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is quite natural .",
    "below , we present results of measurements of the geometrical characteristics of the monopole trajectories belonging to the percolating cluster . in more detail ,",
    "the percolating cluster consists of segments of trajectories connecting crossings .",
    "we measure , in particular , the average length of the segments and average euclidean distance between the crossings , the average value of the crossings per unit of 4-volume . in all these cases we observe simple scaling properties which confirm the reality of the map monopoles as of physical objects .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we study the geometry and scaling properties of the monopole trajectories obtained in the maximal abelian projection of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . to fix the abelian projection we use the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite .",
    "we study monopoles on symmetric , @xmath7 , lattices ( @xmath8 ) for 7 values of @xmath9 .",
    "the size of the lattice , @xmath3 , the coupling , @xmath9 , and the number of the independent gauge field configurations , @xmath10 , is listed in table 1 . to fix the physical scale we use @xmath11 .    in section 3",
    "we study the geometrical properties of the monopole trajectories , in section 4 we discuss the scaling properties of various physical quantities related to monopole trajectories .",
    "the monopole trajectory is constructed from the links on the dual lattice .",
    "it is made from segments ( the trajectories between crossings ) and crossings of the trajectories .",
    "now we show that the monopole trajectory is not a random walk .",
    "consider the correlation of the direction of the link @xmath12 which form the monopole current with the direction of some `` initial '' link @xmath13 .",
    "the considered link is at the distance @xmath14 along the monopole trajectory from the initial link .",
    "the direction @xmath12 can be the same as @xmath13 , the opposite , or other ( neither the same nor the opposite ) . in our normalization",
    "all three correlations are equal to unity for random walk if @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 the opposite direction is forbidden ) . in fig .  1 we show the correlations of the directions for @xmath17 on the lattice @xmath18 .",
    "it is seen that the monopole trajectory has a `` long memory '' . even for links separated by 17 lattice steps from the initial link",
    "the most probable direction is the same as the direction of the initial link .",
    "the average length of the segment of the monopole trajectory between crossings @xmath19 scales , see from fig .  2 .",
    "@xmath19 vs. lattice spacing .",
    "figure 3 .",
    "@xmath20 vs. lattice spacing .",
    "numerically , @xmath21 if we average the data for @xmath22 .",
    "this scaling behavior confirms strongly the fine tuning of the action and entropy factors , see discussion following eq .",
    "( [ fine ] ) .",
    "the data on the average euclidean distance @xmath23 between crossings are presented in fig .",
    "the violations of the scaling are much more substantial in this case . still they can be approximated by a correction linear in the lattice spacing @xmath4 .",
    "number of crossings per unit physical volume vs. lattice spacing .",
    "finally , we found that the number of the crossings of the monopole trajectories per unit physical volume seems to scale as it is seen from fig .",
    "the average @xmath24 corresponds to approximately 10 crossings per hypercube @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity is probably related to @xmath26 constant in the effective monopole lagrangian , @xmath27 is the monopole field .",
