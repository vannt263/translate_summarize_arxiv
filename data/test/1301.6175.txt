    "qed in three space - time dimensions has become a testing laboratory for certain nonperturbative aspects of qft like chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , bound states  @xcite or confinement  @xcite and for various approximation schemes . due to the dimensionality of the coupling constant ( as @xmath0 )",
    "it is a superrenormalizable theory so it is free of infinite renormalization ambiguities typical for four - dimensional theory .",
    "it can be formulated in two inequivalent versions : with two- and four - component fermions  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the theory are different in these two cases . to the investigation of both versions much attention has been payed over the last twenty years .",
    "the work has been especially concentrated on nonperturbative solutions of dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations with different approximations incorporated in the theory as quenched approximation , rainbow approximation , @xmath1 expansion and various models of vertex function  @xcite .",
    "particularly often the multi - flavor theory with the limit @xmath2 has been used , since it avoids infrared problems , which usually become troublesome in lower number of dimensions . the other important point in this analysis",
    "has been the unpleasant gauge dependence of the nonperturbative results which constitute the common problem of the approximated studies based on ds equations  @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , ds equations constitute an infinite set of relations involving green s functions which form the ` inverted ladder ' type structure : the @xmath3-point functions depend on @xmath4-point ones and so on up to infinity .",
    "this set can not be solved without the truncation of such a hierarchy .",
    "but even such truncation , which turns the infinite set of equations into only a couple of them , leads to the system which is far from being trivial and requires further simplifications .",
    "usually this truncation is accomplished by performing certain assumption for the vertex function , which is chosen most often in the form satisfying ward - takahashi identity .",
    "naturally this identity fixes only longitudinal part of the vertex leaving the transverse part a subject of further discussion and improvements  @xcite .    in our previous paper  @xcite",
    "we applied a method elaborated earlier in qed@xmath5  @xcite to qed@xmath6 with two - component fermions .",
    "it consists on the following five steps :    1 .",
    "a certain infrared form of two basic propagators , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( suggested by perturbative calculations or other methods ) as dependent on a couple of unknown parameters is assumed , 2 .",
    "the fermion propagator is represented in the spectral form with one known spectral density @xmath9 , which is in general possible in the infrared domain , 3 .",
    "salam s form of the vertex function  @xcite , together with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is substituted into the first two of the set of ds equations , 4 .   from these two equations",
    "the set of self - consistent equations for parameters is derived , 5 .",
    "the obtained equations are solved numerically or analytically .",
    "this method proved to be relatively effective both in qed@xmath5 , where all parameters were correctly found without the necessity of infinite renormalization , and in spinor version of qed@xmath6 , where obtained results stay in general agreement with other works . in the present paper",
    "we would like to extend its application to four - component qed@xmath6 , without chern - simons term , i.e. when gauge bosons ( ` photons ' ) remain massless in spite of interaction .",
    "the common effect of various simplifications of ds equations is the gauge dependence of the results ( even of the physical observables ) .",
    "the sources of this undesirable behavior are the approximations made to the propagators and to the vertex .",
    "it seems therefore valuable to test various possible approaches with regard to that particular feature and much work has already been done in this direction ( see the references above ) .",
    "this point lies in the scope of interest of the present work too .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model itself and give the resulting set of ds equations . in section  [ sec : assump ] the infrared green s function in question are formulated up to several unknown parameters . in section  [ sec : solu ] we substitute these green s functions into ds equations and obtain the set of relations for the introduced parameters . in the last section we present analytical and numerical results and some conclusions .",
    "the model is defined through following lagrangian density : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gauge parameter .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote here the _ bare _ fermion mass and the _ bare _ coupling constant respectively .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the latter for @xmath14 is a quantity with the dimensionality of @xmath0 .",
    "that means that in the quantum theory higher terms of perturbation expansions have better ultraviolet momentum dependence in loop integrations and the model is superrenormalizable .    as already told , in the present paper we deal with four - component fermion field , choosing the following representation for gamma matrices used also in four - dimensional qed : @xmath15    there are two other gamma matrices , which anticommute with all above , and which can serve for defining chiral transformations : @xmath16    the fermion mass term , that was chosen in  ( [ eq : lagr ] ) in the form @xmath17 , breaks the chiral symmetry defined by any of the matrices  ( [ eq : gamma35 ] ) .",
    "there is , however , the possibility of the other choice for the mass term  @xcite : @xmath18 , where @xmath19=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\openone   &   0\\\\ 0 & -\\openone     \\end{array}\\right)\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : tauma}\\ ] ] this term does not break chiral symmetry , since matrix @xmath20 commutes with both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but it does violate parity symmetry ( contrary to the choice made in  ( [ eq : lagr ] ) ) .    for matrices  ( [ eq : gammas ] )",
    "we have ordinary relations : @xmath23=4g^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\mathrm{tr}\\,\\left[\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu \\gamma^\\rho \\gamma^\\sigma\\right]=4\\left(g^{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\rho\\sigma}-g^{\\mu\\rho}g^{\\nu\\sigma}+g^{\\mu\\sigma}g^{\\nu\\rho}\\right)\\ ; , \\label{eq : toga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we choose for the metric tensor : @xmath24    the trace of the product of an odd number of gamma matrices equals zero as in four dimensions ( this was not the case in the spinor representation , where it was proportional to the antisymmetric tensor @xmath25 ) . additionally we have the identity : @xmath26    using the lagrangian density  ( [ eq : lagr ] ) , one can derive in the standard way  for instance through feynman path integral  the dyson - schwinger equations for propagators  @xcite .",
    "for boson propagator we obtain the relation @xmath27,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : dysph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may be given the graphical form shown in figure  [ fig : dspf ] .",
    "the propagator @xmath8 on the right hand side is not integrated over three - momenta and therefore it can fully be represented through fermion functions ( and the vertex ) .    the ds equation for the fermion propagator does not allow for such a separation , and has the form @xmath28\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    its graphical representation is shown in figure  [ fig : dsef ] . while introducing the fermion self - energy @xmath29 ,",
    "it can be rewritten in a simpler manner @xmath30 where @xmath31    higher equations are not considered in our present approach .",
    "the vertex function @xmath32 is not taken from ds equations , but postulated in the form proposed by salam  @xcite and used afterwards in the so called ` gauge technique '  @xcite .",
    "the eventual extension of our method on higher green s functions will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the free propagator of massless vector boson has the standard form : @xmath33    as is well known , the interaction with fermions does not change the longitudinal part of @xmath8 .",
    "this is guaranteed by the following ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity @xmath34 consequently the nonperturbative propagator may be then written as @xmath35 with certain unknown function @xmath36 . in the infrared domain",
    "we assume this function to have a taylor expansion starting from @xmath37 , since for bispinor fermions the boson field remains massless  @xcite and we expect @xmath38 .",
    "this is not the case for massive two - component fermions , for which the topological boson mass is generated .",
    "taking the first two terms of this expansion , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 , together with the renormalization constant @xmath41 , will be determined from consistency conditions . from the unitarity we expect the value of @xmath41 to satisfy the restriction @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "this expectation was actually confirmed in our previous works on spinor qed@xmath6  @xcite and qed@xmath5  @xcite .    with the above assumptions the inverse of @xmath43",
    "may be written as @xmath44    the free fermion propagator has the usual form : @xmath45 due to the masslessness of the gauge boson and the absence of the mass gap for emission of soft photons , the pole at mass @xmath12 should , in the full propagator , turn into a branch point at @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a physical mass .",
    "this is expected also on the basis of general considerations on the analytical structure of fermion propagator  @xcite and of confinement , which prohibits @xmath7 from having a simple pole .",
    "the numerical results , performed in @xmath1 expansion with bare vertex and in euclidean space , suggesting the existence of _ complex _ singularities rather than _ real _ may as well constitute the effect of the coarse approximations made while solving ds equations : the approximations that are inevitable in any nonperturbative approach .",
    "such singularities may be a signal of confinement , but are not prerequisite . in the schwinger model ,",
    "massless electrodynamics in two space - time dimensions , which exhibits confinement of fermions , the _ real _ singularity in the infrared domain in the fermion propagator has been found ( it has the form of  @xmath48 )  @xcite .",
    "our infrared assumption for @xmath7 is then : @xmath49 we will see later that it will turn out to be self - consistent .    the values of the exponent @xmath50 and of mass renormalization constant @xmath51 will be established by the requirement of consistency .",
    "the presence of @xmath50 in denominator improves the ultraviolet behavior of loop integrals ( we assume that @xmath52 , to be verified _ a posteriori _ ) .    for our further purposes",
    "@xmath7 has to be written in the spectral form @xmath53 with the one spectral density : @xmath54\\ ; , \\label{eq : ro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] sufficient to define the infrared behavior of the propagator .",
    "@xmath55 is here the heaviside step function .",
    "the particular form of @xmath9 was given in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "using @xmath9 , one can write the vertex function , which we need to put into ds equations  ( [ eq : dysph ] )  and  ( [ eq : dyse ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we use the salam s vertex  @xcite ( with slight and obvious modification resulting from the form  ( [ eq : sp ] ) of @xmath7 , which in our case contains two terms ) : @xmath56 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : verp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it automatically guarantees the compliance with the wt identity : @xmath57",
    "inserting  ( [ eq : sp ] ) and  ( [ eq : verp ] ) into the right hand side of  ( [ eq : dysph ] ) we obtain    @xmath58    where we have rewritten this equation for inverse propagator , which is easier to handle , because in this case @xmath43 decouples from other functions .",
    "the vacuum polarization tensor may be defined as the spectral integral @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the usual perturbative tensor : @xmath61    it may be evaluated in the standard way with the use of identities  ( [ eq : toga ] ) , and for instance by performing wicks rotation and introducing feynman parameters .",
    "passing back to minkowski space , we have @xmath62    for @xmath63 the @xmath64 integral is well defined .",
    "the transversality of @xmath60 is a favorable consequence of using the vertex function in the form  ( [ eq : verp ] ) , satisfying the wt identity  ( [ eq : kve ] ) . performing the spectral integral over @xmath65 in  ( [ eq : pote ] ) with the use of  ( [ eq : ro ] ) , similarly as it was done in  @xcite",
