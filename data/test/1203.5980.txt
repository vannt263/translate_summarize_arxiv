    "to describe the interaction between matter and a single - mode quantized electromagnetic field , some version of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model is often applied @xcite .",
    "the jc - model was first employed by jaynes and cummings to describe the interaction of photons with molecules but since then it has also been used in cavity electrodynamics to successfully describe matter - photon interaction in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum dots @xcite and in superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "advances in the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics have enabled us to enter the ultrastrong coupling regime where the photon - matter coupling strength reaches a considerable fraction of the energy of a single cavity photon .",
    "this has been achieved by taking advantage of large dipole moments and long coherence times in superconducting flux qubits @xcite and semiconductor quantum wells @xcite embedded in high quality micro - cavities .    in the ultrastrong regime",
    ", the jc model fails and evidence of the breakdown of the jc - model with the rotating wave approximation has been observed experimentally in superconducting @xcite and semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "exact numerical calculations predict the failure of the jc - model ( even without the rotating wave approximation ) where the effects of the diamagnetic matter - photon interaction term as well as effects of states which are not part of the two level system approximation come into play with high coupling strength @xcite .    using the method described later in this publication",
    ", we have been able to calculate time dependent electron transport through a photon cavity @xcite and to test the validity of the jaynes - cummings model in the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite . with our approach",
    ", it would be relatively easy to add a time dependent perturbation to the closed system and integrate the equation of motion numerically .",
    "choosing the frequency of the perturbation such that the em field does not have time to adjust adiabatically , it is possible to investigate non - adiabatic dynamics related to the dynamical casimir effect @xcite where photons can then be excited out of vacuum in correlated pairs .",
    "this non - adiabatic effect was recently observed experimentally for the first time @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a general method which can be used to describe the interaction between an electronic / atomic system with a single - mode quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "we begin by calculating eigenfunctions and energies of the single - electron hamiltonian ( initially completely ignoring many - body effects and the em field ) .",
    "we then use a number of the lowest single - electron eigenstates to construct a many - electron fock state basis which is used to compute the eigenstates and energies of the many - electron hamiltonian including the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "finally , we use a number of the lowest coulomb interacting eigenstates to construct a joint electron - photon basis .",
    "in diagonalizing the electron - photon hamiltonian we obtain its eigenstates which include the electron - photon and electron - electron interaction `` exactly '' in the sense that the only approximations are the finite sizes of single / many particle bases and finite size of grids used for numerical integration .",
    "the results are convergent with respect to these parameters in a controllable manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] we give a description of the single - electron hamiltonian and calculate its eigenfunctions , which we use as a basis for many - body calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : many ] we introduce the second quantization many - body formalism needed to account for the coulomb interaction between electrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : em ] we couple the electronic system to single - mode quantized electromagnetic field and solve the many - body schrdinger equation using a basis of coulomb interacting electron states as well as photon fock states . results and concluding remarks are presented in secs . [",
    "sec : results ] and [ sec : conclusions ] respectively .",
    "the system under investigation is a two - dimensional electronic nanostructure exposed to a static ( classical ) external magnetic field at a low temperature .",
    "the electronic nanostructure is assumed to be fabricated by split - gate configuration in the y - direction , forming a parabolic confinement with the characteristic frequency @xmath0 on top of a semiconductor heterostructure .",
    "the ends of the nanostructure in the x - direction at @xmath1 are etched , forming a hard - wall confinement of length @xmath2 .",
    "the external classical magnetic field is given by @xmath3 with a vector potential @xmath4 .",
    "since we are interested in geometrical effects , we need the single - electron eigenstates to construct a many - body basis . we therefore need to solve the time independent schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the effective mass of an electron , @xmath7 its charge , @xmath8 the canonical momentum operator , @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath10 is the modified parabolic confinement .",
    "note that the spin degree of freedom is neglected . with the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath11 , the mixing term @xmath12 makes it impossible to use separation of variables to solve the time independent schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian in eq . analytically .",
    "this means we will have to resort to numerical techniques .",
    "this procedure is relatively straightforward and will only be briefly covered here .    to solve the time independent schrdinger equation for @xmath13 , we compute the matrix representation of @xmath13 in the basis @xmath14 where @xmath15 are eigenstates of @xmath13 when the mixing term @xmath12 is omitted .",
    "the matrix elements are calculated analytically .",
    "furthermore let us assume we have a bijection @xmath16 such that we can label the basis states using a single index @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . in coordinate representation , we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a characteristic length of the system and @xmath22 are hermite polynomials .",
    "after computing the matrix representation of @xmath13 in the chosen basis , we diagonalize it and obtain it s eigenstates @xmath23 and corresponding energies @xmath24 which satisfy @xmath25 . note that @xmath26 is the ground state , @xmath27 the first excited state etc . in the diagonalization process",
    "we also obtain a unitary transformation which satisfies @xmath28 finally the wavefunctions of the lowest @xmath29 single - electron states @xmath30 are calculated and saved on a grid using @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of basis states used for calculations . in actual calculations we used approximately @xmath33 basis states in the @xmath34-direction and @xmath35 in the y - direction so @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] , giving @xmath38 .",
    "this is a large enough basis such that numerical error due to the truncation is much smaller than the error due to later truncation of many - body spaces .",
    "for this reason we will not investigate convergence for the single - electron system in this paper .",
    "we can write the many - electron hamiltonian as a sum of two terms @xmath39 where @xmath40 only contains the coulomb interaction between electrons . using the single - electron eigenstates @xmath41 as a basis",
    ", we can write the two terms in second quantization as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operators of an electron in state @xmath45 . the operators satisfy the usual fermionic anti - commutation relation @xmath46 and all other anti - commutators are zero .",
    "the matrix element @xmath47 in is a double integral in the spacial variables and involves integration with respect to the observation location @xmath48 @xmath49 and the integration with respect to the source location @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the coulomb potential given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a small positive regularization parameter .",
    "the integrals in and can not be done analytically due to the nontrivial geometry so they are performed numerically using a gaussian quadrature scheme .",
    "we have to be careful with the numerical integration because technically the wave functions reach infinity in the @xmath55-direction , although exponentially decaying .",
    "we therefore have to find some sensible cutoff in the @xmath55-direction where the amplitude of the eigenfunctions is close to zero .",
    "we used a grid size of @xmath56 for the gaussian integration .",
    "this grid size is sufficiently large such that the numerical error in the gaussian quadrature is much smaller than the error due to basis truncations .",
    "we note however , that for a larger magnetic field , a bigger grid might be required due to more rapid fluctuations in the phase of the eigenfunctions @xmath30 .",
    "to make sure that the @xmath55 cutoff is reasonable and the grid is sufficiently dense we checked the normalization of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the coulomb potential is integrable in the origin , i.  e.  for @xmath57 , in two dimensions , for @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the integral is mathematically convergent and the regularization parameter @xmath54 is theoretically not needed .",
    "however , due to the discretization of the two - dimensional space , working in practice with @xmath58 can nevertheless cause problems in the numerical integration .",
    "a quick way around this problem is replacing @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 it s easy to show that the transformation @xmath62 leaves @xmath40 unchanged and conveniently rids of us of the convergence problems we had with @xmath63 .",
    "the validity of this transformation does not depend on geometry or dimension @xcite .",
    "we note that even though the limit @xmath64 is well defined in , we still have to keep @xmath65 for numerical reasons .",
    "however , we can have @xmath54 much smaller than if we used directly .    now that we have the form of the many - electron hamiltonian we need to find a suitable basis for the many - electron fock space .",
    "the natural choice is the occupation number basis @xmath66 where @xmath67 which means that @xmath68 particles are in state @xmath26 , @xmath69 in state @xmath27 etc .",
    "we use latin indices for the single - electron states and greek ones for the many electron states . for fermions",
    "we have @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "for example , @xmath72 when doing calculations , the fock space needs to be truncated by putting @xmath73 in , where @xmath74 is a finite positive integer .",
    "this means we are using a finite number of single - electron states to construct the fock space .",
    "this is the first truncation we perform on fock space .",
    "the corresponding number of many - electron states @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of electrons .",
    "this rapid growth of @xmath75 obviously limits us to calculations for a few electrons only .    to use this fock basis",
    "we need some way to uniquely number the states .",
    "we need some mapping @xmath78 where @xmath79 and it s inverse @xmath80 .",
    "there are many ways to construct @xmath81 .",
    "the exact details will depend on factors such as whether or not all the states @xmath82 contain the same number of electrons . for a closed system",
    "the electron number is constant @xcite , however an open system would have a varying number of electrons @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will not go into details of the form of @xmath81 , but assume that we have such a mapping .",
    "we can now calculate the matrix representation of @xmath83 in the @xmath66 basis using @xmath84 where @xmath85 is calculated using @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87 the phase factor @xmath88 ensures that @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfy the fermionic anti - commutation relations .",
    "next we diagonalize @xmath83 and find its eigenstates @xmath89 and energies @xmath90 . in the diagonalization process we obtain a unitary transformation @xmath91 which satisfies @xmath92 we distinguish between the many - body noninteracting and the many - body interacting states by using an angular bracket for the kets of the first type , @xmath93 , and a rounded bracket for the kets of the second type , @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "this unitary transformation will be used extensively because it is much more efficient to perform calculations in the @xmath66 basis and perform a unitary transformation to @xmath95 , rather than explicitly calculating and storing the many - electron eigenfunctions .",
    "this means that every time we need @xmath89 for calculations , we need to perform a unitary transformation using a matrix that has the dimension @xmath96 .",
    "this can be a problem since @xmath75 is a rapidly increasing function of @xmath77 and @xmath74 .",
    "for our calculations we use @xmath97 for two electrons , resulting in @xmath98 . for three electrons",
    "we use @xmath99 , resulting in @xmath100 . the case for a",
    "single - electron is trivial since @xmath101 . for these values of @xmath74 and electron numbers",
    "we get a truncation error that is smaller than the error due to the truncation of the electron - photon fock space which is covered in the next section . for this reason we will not go into discussion of convergence for the purely electronic fock space .    before we go on and include interaction with a quantized em field we note that if two fock states @xmath82 and @xmath102 do not have the same number of electrons , then @xmath103 for all @xmath17,@xmath104,@xmath105,@xmath106 . in other words",
    "the coulomb interaction conserves the number of electrons .",
    "this means that there exists a basis where @xmath83 is block diagonal , where each block consists of states with the same number of electrons .",
    "therefore , there exist unitary transformations @xmath107 for each number of electrons which has the same dimension as the block of @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath77 electrons .",
    "we can therefore use many small unitary transformations for each electron number instead of a big one which works for all number of electrons .",
    "this can be a big boost in computation speed for large matrices .",
    "now suppose the system described in section [ sec : single ] is subject to a single - mode quantized electromagnetic field with vector potential @xmath108 .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath109 where @xmath83 is the purely electronic hamiltonian including the coulomb interaction , @xmath110 is the free field photon term and @xmath111 contains the electron - photon interaction .",
    "ignoring the zero point energy , the free field term can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the single photon energy and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) is a bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator .",
    "the electron - photon interaction term can be split into two terms @xmath116 where @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the mechanical momentum .",
    "the term in is the paramagnetic interaction term and is the diamagnetic term . to go",
    "further we need to decide upon the form of @xmath108 .",
    "we assume that the single - mode photon wavelength is much larger than characteristic length scales of the system .",
    "we can then approximate the vector potential amplitude to be constant over the electronic system . although related , this is not exactly the dipole approximation since we will not omit the diamagnetic electron - photon interaction term .",
    "we can then write the vector potential as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a unit vector in the direction of the field polarization and @xmath121 is the electron - photon coupling strength .",
    "the strength of the photon - electron coupling is characterized by @xmath122 , the magnitude of which depends on the experimental setup . for a 3d fabry perot cavity",
    "we would have @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the cavity volume .",
    "another potential setup is a 1d transmission line resonator @xcite where it would be more appropriate to write @xmath122 in terms of the electric field vacuum fluctuation @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the lowest eigenstates of @xmath110 .",
    "we would then have @xmath128 .",
    "using the approximation in eq . , the expressions for @xmath129 in eqs . - can be greatly simplified since we can pull @xmath108 in front of the integrals and the commutator @xmath130 $ ] is zero . for the paramagnetic term",

    "a natural choice of basis for doing calculations is @xmath141 where @xmath142 are eigenstates of the photon number operator @xmath143 , with @xmath144 the number of photons .",
    "we will obviously need another bijection to label the states @xmath145 with a single index @xmath146 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath147 and @xmath144 on @xmath146 is suppressed for easier reading . for the @xmath148 basis",
    "we use the lowest @xmath149 coulomb interacting eigenstates and photon states containing up to @xmath150 photons , resulting in a total of @xmath151 states in the @xmath152 basis .",
    "this is the second time we truncate a many - body fock space .",
    "appropriate values of @xmath153 and @xmath150 are investigated in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "calculating matrix elements of @xmath83 and @xmath110 is straightforward in the @xmath154 basis .",

    "again we use the right angular bracket for the basis states and the rounded bracket for the interacting states , this time the interaction being between electrons and photons .",
    "expectation values of an observable @xmath169 can then be calculated using @xmath170 where @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) is the density matrix of the system in the @xmath166 ( @xmath173 ) basis .",

    "example of an interesting observable is the photon number operator @xmath178 .",

    "the importance of the diamagnetic interaction term is also illustrated in figure  [ fig : diamagnetic ] by plotting the same energy spectrum , but omitting the diamagnetic term .",
    "for small coupling , ignoring the diamagnetic term is a valid approximation .",
    "however , for higher coupling strength , the model without the diamagnetic term starts exhibiting red shift with respect to the exact result .",
    "this red shift becomes visible at around @xmath199 , where the values of @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 are given in the figure text .",
    "for even higher coupling strength , the results without the diamagnetic term start exhibiting an unphysical downwards dive in energy . in this regime ,",
