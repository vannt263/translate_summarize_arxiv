    "in the theory of critical phenomena it is usually assumed that a physical system near a continuous phase transition is characterized by a single length scale ( the `` correlation length '' ) in terms of which all other lengths should be measured . when combined with the experimental observation that the correlation length diverges at the phase transition , this simple but strong assumption , known as the scaling hypothesis , leads to the belief that at criticality the system has no characteristic length , and is therefore invariant under scale transformations .",
    "this suggests that all thermodynamic functions at criticality are homogeneous functions , and predicts the appearance of power laws .",
    "it also means that it should be possible to rescale a critical system appropriately and obtain a continuum model ( the `` continuum scaling limit '' ) which may have more symmetries and be easier to study than the original discrete model defined on a lattice .",
    "indeed , thanks to the work of polyakov  @xcite and others  @xcite , it was understood by physicists since the early seventies that critical statistical mechanical models should possess continuum scaling limits with a global conformal invariance that goes beyond simple scale invariance , as long as the discrete models have `` enough '' rotation invariance .",
    "this property gives important information , enabling the determination of two- and three - point functions at criticality , when they are nonvanishing . because the conformal group is in general a finite dimensional lie group ,",
    "the resulting constraints are limited in number ; however , the situation becomes particularly interesting in two dimensions , since there every analytic function @xmath1 defines a conformal transformation , at least at points where @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the conformal group in two dimensions is infinite - dimensional .",
    "after this observation was made , a large number of critical problems in two dimensions were analyzed using conformal methods , which were applied , among others , to ising and potts models , brownian motion , self - avoiding walk ( saw ) , percolation , and diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) .",
    "the large body of knowledge and techniques that resulted , starting with the work of belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov  @xcite in the early eighties , goes under the name of conformal field theory ( cft ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "one of the main goals of cft and its most important application to statistical mechanics is a complete classification of all universality classes via irreducible representations of the infinite - dimensional virasoro algebra . partly because of the success of cft , work in recent years on critical phenomena seemed to slow down somewhat , probably due to the feeling that most of the leading problems had been resolved",
    "nonetheless , however powerful and successful it may be , cft has some limitations and leaves various open problems .",
    "first of all , the theory deals primarily with correlation functions of _ local _ ( or quasi - local ) operators , and is therefore not always the best tool to investigate other quantities .",
    "secondly , given some critical lattice model , there is no way , within the theory itself , of deciding to which cft it corresponds .",
    "a third limitation , of a different nature , is due to the fact that the methods of cft , although very powerful , are generally speaking not completely rigorous from a mathematical point of view .    in a somewhat surprising twist ,",
    "the most recent developments in the area of two - dimensional critical phenomena have emerged in the mathematics literature and have followed a new direction , which has provided new tools and a way of coping with at least some of the limitations of cft .",
    "the new approach may even provide a reinterpretation of cft , and seems to be complementary to the traditional one in the sense that questions that are difficult to pose and/or answer within cft are easy and natural in this new approach and vice versa .",
    "these new developments came on the heels of interesting results on the scaling limits of discrete models ( see , e.g. , the work of aizenman  @xcite , benjamini - schramm  @xcite , aizenman - burchard  @xcite , aizenman - burchard - newman - wilson  @xcite , aizenman - duplantier - aharony  @xcite and kenyon  @xcite ) but they differ greatly from those because they are based on a radically new approach whose main tool is the stochastic loewner evolution ( @xmath3 ) , or schramm - loewner evolution , as it is also known , introduced by schramm  @xcite .",
    "the new approach , which is probabilistic in nature , focuses directly on non - local structures that characterize a given system , such as cluster boundaries in ising , potts and percolation models , or loops in the @xmath4 model . at criticality ,",
    "these non - local objects become , in the continuum limit , random curves whose distributions can be uniquely identified thanks to their conformal invariance and a certain  markovian \" property .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of @xmath3s , indexed by a positive real number @xmath5 , and they appear to be the only possible candidates for the scaling limits of interfaces of two - dimensional critical systems that are believed to be conformally invariant .",
    "in particular , substantial progress has been made in recent years , thanks to @xmath3 , in understanding the fractal and conformally invariant nature of ( the scaling limit of ) large percolation clusters , which has attracted much attention and is of interest both for intrinsic reasons , given the many applications of percolation , and as a paradigm for the behavior of other systems .",
    "the work of schramm  @xcite and smirnov  @xcite has identified the scaling limit of a certain percolation interface with @xmath0 , providing , along with the work of lawler - schramm - werner  @xcite and smirnov - werner  @xcite , a confirmation of many results in the physics literature , as well as some new results .",
    "however , @xmath0 describes a single interface , which can be obtained by imposing special boundary conditions , and is not in itself sufficient to immediately describe the scaling limit of the unconstrained model ( without boundary conditions ) in the whole plane .",
    "in particular , not only the nature and properties , but the very existence of the scaling limit of the collection of all interfaces remained an open question .",
    "this is true of all models , such as ising and potts models , that are represented in terms of clusters , and where the set of all interfaces forms a collection of loops . as already indicated by smirnov  @xcite",
    ", such a collection of loops should have a continuum limit , that we will call the  full \" scaling limit of the model .",
    "the single interface limit is ideal for analyzing certain crossing / connectivity probabilities but not so good for others ; in section  [ quickresults ] we give a few examples showing the use of the full scaling limit to represent such probabilities . in the context of percolation , in  @xcite",
    "the authors used @xmath0 to construct a random process of continuous loops in the plane , which was identified with the full scaling limit of critical two - dimensional percolation , but without detailed proofs .",
    "( for a discussion of whether this full scaling limit is a  black noise , \" see  @xcite . for an analysis of random processes of loops related to @xmath6 for other values of @xmath5 , and",
    "_ conjectured _ to correspond to the full scaling limits of other statistical mechanics models , see  @xcite . )    in this paper , we complete the analysis of  @xcite , making rigorous the connection between the construction given there and the full scaling limit of percolation , and we prove some properties of the full scaling limit , the continuum nonsimple loop process , including ( one version of ) conformal invariance .",
    "the present work , as well as that of smirnov  @xcite , builds on a collection of papers , including  @xcite , which provided both inspiration and essential technical results .",
    "the proofs are based on the fact that the percolation exploration path converges in distribution to the trace of chordal @xmath0 , as argued by schramm and smirnov  @xcite , and in particular on a specific version of this convergence that we will call statement ( s ) ( see section  [ main - results ] ) .",
    "we note that no detailed proof of any version of convergence to @xmath0 has been available .",
    "nevertheless , at the request of the editor , we do not include a detailed proof of statement ( s ) in the present paper , as originally planned  @xcite , due to length considerations .    however , a detailed proof of statement ( s ) , based on smirnov s theorem about the convergence of crossing probabilities to cardy s formula  @xcite , is now the topic of a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "we note that statement ( s ) is restricted to jordan domains while no such restriction is indicated in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ quickresults ] ,",
    "we provide a quick presentation of theorems  [ main - result1 ] , [ features ] , and [ main - result2 ] , which represent most of our main results , with some definitions postponed until section  [ defs ] , including that of @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ construct ] is devoted to the construction mentioned in theorem  [ main - result2 ] of the continuum nonsimple loop process in a finite region @xmath7 of the plane . in section  [ lapa ]",
    ", we introduce the discrete lattice model and a discrete construction analogous to the continuum one presented in section  [ construct ] .",
    "most of the main technical results of this paper are stated in section  [ main - results ] , while section  [ proofs ] contains the proofs , using ( s ) , of those results and the results in section  [ quickresults ] .      at the percolation critical point , with probability one",
    "there is no infinite cluster ( in two dimensions ) , therefore the percolation cluster boundaries form loops ( see figure  [ loops ] , where site percolation on the triangular lattice @xmath8 is depicted exploiting the duality between @xmath8 and the hexagonal lattice @xmath9 ) .",
    "we will refer to the continuum scaling limit ( as the mesh size @xmath10 of the rescaled hexagonal lattice @xmath11 goes to zero ) of the collection of all these loops as the continuum nonsimple loop process .",
    "its existence is the content of theorem  [ main - result1 ] and some of its properties are described in theorem  [ features ] below .    .",
    "each hexagon of the hexagonal lattice @xmath9 represents a site of @xmath8 and is assigned one of two colors . in the critical percolation model , colors are assigned randomly with equal probability .",
    "the cluster boundaries are indicated by heavy lines ; some small loops appear , while other boundaries extend beyond the finite window .",
    ", width=302 ]    the continuum nonsimple loop process can be described as a  gas \" of loops , or more precisely , a probability measure on countable collections of continuous , nonsimple , fractal loops in the plane . later in this paper",
    ", we will provide precise definitions of the objects involved in the next three theorems as well as detailed proofs .",
    "[ main - result1 ] in the continuum scaling limit , the probability distribution of the collection of all boundary contours of critical site percolation on the triangular lattice converges to a probability distribution on collections of continuous , nonsimple loops .",
    "[ features ] the continuum nonsimple loop process whose distribution is specified in theorem  [ main - result1 ] has the following properties , which are valid with probability one :    1 .",
    "it is a random collection of countably many noncrossing continuous loops in the plane .",
    "the loops can and do touch themselves and each other many times , but there are no triple points ; i.e. no three or more loops can come together at the same point , and a single loop can not touch the same point more than twice , nor can a loop touch a point where another loop touches itself .",
    "any deterministic point @xmath12 in the plane ( i.e. , chosen independently of the loop process ) is surrounded by an infinite family of nested loops with diameters going to both zero and infinity ; any annulus about that point with inner radius @xmath13 and outer radius @xmath14 contains only a finite number @xmath15 of those loops .",
    "consequently , any two distinct deterministic points of the plane are separated by loops winding around each of them .",
    "any two loops are connected by a finite `` path '' of touching loops .",
    "the next theorem makes explicit the relation between the percolation full scaling limit and @xmath0 .",
    "its proof ( see section  [ proofs ] ) relies on an inductive procedure that makes use of @xmath0 at each step and allows to obtain collections of loops with the correct distribution .",
    "[ main - result2 ] a continuum nonsimple loop process with the same distribution as in theorem  [ main - result1 ] can be constructed by a procedure in which each loop is obtained as the concatenation of an @xmath0 path with ( a portion of ) another @xmath0 path ( see figure  [ fig - sec3 ] ) .",
    "this procedure is carried out first in a finite disk @xmath16 of radius @xmath17 in the plane ( see section  [ unit - disc ] ) , and then an infinite volume limit , @xmath18 , is taken .",
    "[ conf - inv ] there are various possible ways to formulate the conformal invariance properties of the continuum nonsimple loop process .",
    "one version is given in theorem  [ thm - conf - inv ] .",
    "next we give some examples showing how the scaling limit of various connectivity / crossing probabilities can be expressed in terms of the loop process .",
    "although we can not say whether this fact may eventually lead to exact expressions going beyond cardy s formula , it at least shows that scaling limits of such probabilities exist and are conformally invariant ( early discussions of scaling limits of connectivity functions and of the consequences of conformal invariance for such quantities are given in  @xcite ) .",
    "the examples will also highlight the natural nested structure of the collection of percolation cluster boundaries in the scaling limit .",
    "consider first an annulus centered at @xmath12 with inner radius @xmath19 and outer radius @xmath20 ( see figure  [ annulus ] ) .",
    "the scaling limit @xmath21 of the probability of a crossing of the annulus ( by crossing here we refer to a  monochromatic \" crossing , i.e. , a crossing by either of the two colors , as discussed in section  [ lapa ]  see also figure  [ loops ] ) can be expressed as follows in terms of the random variable @xmath22 defined in theorem  [ features ] above : @xmath21 is the probability that @xmath22 equals zero .",
    "more generally , @xmath22 represents the scaling limit of the minimal number of cluster boundaries traversed by any path connecting the inner and outer circles of the annulus .",
    "an example with more geometric structure involves two disjoint discs @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the plane and the scaling limit @xmath25 of the probability that there is a crossing from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( see figure  [ discs ] ) .",
    "here we let @xmath26 denote the number of distinct loops in the plane that contain @xmath23 in their interior and @xmath24 in their exterior , and define @xmath27 in the complementary way .",
    "then @xmath25 is the probability that @xmath28 , and the scaling limit of the minimal number of cluster boundaries that must be crossed to connect @xmath23 to @xmath24 is @xmath29 .",
    "one can also consider , as in  @xcite , the probability of a single monochromatic cluster in the exterior @xmath30 of the union of @xmath31 disjoint discs ( or other regions ) connecting all @xmath31 disc boundaries . in the scaling limit , this can be expressed as the probability of the event that there is a single continuous ( nonsimple ) curve in @xmath30 touching all @xmath31 disc boundaries that _ does not cross any of the loops of the continuum nonsimple loop process .",
    "_    we conclude this section by remarking that the continuum nonsimple loop process is just one example of a family of  conformal loop ensembles \" that are related to @xmath3 and to the gaussian free field ( see  @xcite ) , and are conjectured to describe the full scaling limit of statistical mechanics models such as percolation , ising and potts models .",
    "the work of lawler , schramm , sheffield and werner has provided tools to define such loop ensembles in the continuum and to study some of their properties .",
    "but the key question concerning the proof of their connection to the discrete models via a continuum scaling limit remains an important open challenge , the only exception currently being percolation , as we show in this paper .",
    "we will find it convenient to identify the real plane @xmath32 and the complex plane @xmath33 .",
    "we will also refer to the riemann sphere @xmath34 and the open upper half - plane @xmath35 ( and its closure @xmath36 ) , where chordal @xmath3 will be defined ( see section  [ sle1 ] ) .",

    "we will make repeated use of riemann s mapping theorem , which states that if @xmath7 is any simply connected domain other than the entire plane @xmath33 and @xmath40 , then there is a unique conformal map @xmath41 of @xmath7 onto @xmath37 such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "when taking the scaling limit as the lattice mesh size @xmath44 one can focus on fixed finite regions , @xmath45 , or consider the whole @xmath32 at once .",
    "the second option avoids dealing with boundary conditions , but requires an appropriate choice of metric",
    ".    a convenient way of dealing with the whole @xmath32 is to replace the euclidean metric with a distance function @xmath46 defined on @xmath47 by @xmath48 where the infimum is over all smooth curves @xmath49 joining @xmath50 with @xmath51 , parameterized by arclength @xmath52 , and where @xmath53 denotes the euclidean norm .",
