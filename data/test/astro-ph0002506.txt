    "x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies show that in the central regions of most clusters the cooling time of the intracluster gas is significantly less than a hubble time ( edge , stewart & fabian 1992 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; peres 1998 ) .",
    "this cooling is thought to lead to a slow net inflow of material towards the cluster centre ; a process known as a cooling flow ( see fabian 1994 for a review ) .",
    "x - ray imaging data show that gas typically ` cools out ' throughout the central few tens to hundreds of kpc in clusters , with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the integrated mass deposition rate within radius @xmath4 ( thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy has confirmed the presence of distributed cooling gas in cooling flows , with a spatial distribution and luminosity in good agreement with the predictions from the imaging data and cooling - flow models ( allen & fabian 1997 ) .    for some years , the primary uncertainty with the standard model for cooling flows was the fate of the cooled matter ( see fabian , nulsen & canizares 1991 ) .",
    "however , the discovery of large column densities of intrinsic x - ray absorbing material associated with cooling flows observed with the solid state spectrometer ( sss ) on the einstein observatory ( white 1991 ; johnstone 1992 ) opened one interesting possibility .",
    "follow - up spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on rosat ( allen 1993 ; irwin & sarazin 1995 ; allen & fabian 1997 ) confirmed the presence of intrinsic x - ray absorbing material in cooling - flow clusters and further showed this material to be distributed throughout , but centrally - concentrated within , the cooling flows .",
    "the x - ray data thus identify the intrinsic x - ray absorbing material as a plausible sink for the cooled gas deposited by the cooling flows .    in this paper",
    "we examine the x - ray properties of the cooling flows in a sample of 30 of the most x - ray luminous ( @xmath5 ) clusters of galaxies known . using asca spectra and",
    "rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) data , we present independent determinations of the mass deposition rates in the cooling flows and measure the column densities of intrinsic x - ray absorbing material associated with these systems .",
    "we show that the cooling flow model provides a consistent description of the x - ray imaging and spectral data and that the observed masses of intrinsic x - ray absorbing material are in reasonable agreement with the masses expected to have been accumulated by the cooling flows over their lifetimes .",
    "we also discuss the evidence for mass deposition from the cooling flows in other wavebands .",
    "this is the final paper in a series that has examined the impact of cooling flows on mass measurements ( allen 1998 ) , the @xmath6 relation ( allen & fabian 1998a ) and metallicity measurements ( allen & fabian 1998b ) for x - ray luminous clusters . in this paper",
    ", we describe the data reduction and analysis procedures used in these works . a large number of other , previous studies have also analysed one or more of data sets included here ( see references in the papers listed above ) , although these studies have not , in general , examined the properties of the cooling flows in the clusters .",
    "exceptions are the deprojection analysis of peres ( 1998 ) , and the combined asca / rosat studies of allen ( 1996 ) , schindler ( 1997 ) , bhringer ( 1998 ) and rizza ( 1998 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath7=50 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are assumed throughout .",
    "our sample was identified from clusters contained in the rosat x - ray brightest abell - type cluster sample ( xbacs ; ebeling 1996 ) and rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs ; ebeling 1998 ) with x - ray luminosities in the @xmath10 kev band exceeding @xmath11 . from this initial list ,",
    "we selected for study those targets with asca x - ray spectra and rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) data available on the goddard space flight centre ( gsfc ) public archive as of 1997 july 15 .",
    "we supplemented this sample with a number of other , southern x - ray luminous clusters , known to exhibit strong gravitational lensing effects ( pks0745 - 191 , rxj1347.5 - 1145 , ms2137.3 - 2353 , ac114 ) and the distant , luminous cooling - flow clusters abell 1068 , 1704 and iras 09104 + 4109 .",
    "the primary goal of this project was to investigate the x - ray properties of cooling flows in x - ray luminous clusters and their effects on the integrated x - ray properties of their host systems .",
    "we have not included either the perseus ( abell 426 ) or coma ( abell 1656 ) clusters in our study , although these systems met our selection criteria , since both are too close ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) to allow their integrated cluster properties to be studied using the techniques used in this paper .",
    "detailed analyses of these clusters and other nearby cooling flows are discussed by allen ( 1999 ) .    the clusters abell 370 , 115 and 1758 also met the selection criteria but were not included in our study since rosat hri images show them not be single , coherent structures but to consist of a number of merging subunits .",
    "the integrated x - ray spectra for such clusters will relate to the virial properties of the individual subclusters rather than the systems as a whole , and the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium required by the x - ray modeling will not apply .",
    "the x - ray images for the other clusters included in the sample do not exhibit any dramatic substructure that would suggest these assumptions to be invalid .",
    "our final sample consists of 30 clusters , spanning the redshift range @xmath14 , with a mean redshift of 0.21 .",
    "the asca ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) observations were made over a three - and - a - half year period between 1993 april and 1996 december .",
    "the asca x - ray telescope array ( xrt ) consists of four nested - foil telescopes , each focussed onto one of four detectors ; two x - ray ccd cameras , the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ; s0 and s1 ) , and two gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( gis ; g2 and g3 ) . the xrt provides a spatial resolution of @xmath15 arcmin half power diameter ( hpd ) in the energy range @xmath16 kev .",

    "the asca data were reduced using the ftools software ( version 3.6 ) issued by gsfc , from within the xselect environment ( version 1.3 ) .",
    "further data - cleaning procedures as recommended in the asca data reduction guide , including appropriate grade selection , gain corrections and manual screening based on the individual instrument light curves , were followed .",
    "a summary of the asca observations , including the individual exposure times after all screening procedures were carried out , is provided in table 1 .",
    "spectra were extracted from all four asca detectors ( except in those few cases where the s1 data were lost due to saturation problems caused by flickering pixels in the ccds ) .",
    "the spectra were extracted from circular regions , centred on the peaks of the x - ray emission . for the sis data ,",
    "the radii of the regions used were selected to minimize the number of chip boundaries crossed ( thereby minimizing the systematic uncertainties introduced by such crossings ) whilst covering as large a region of the clusters as possible .",
    "data from the regions between the chips were masked out and excluded .",
    "the final extraction radii for the sis data are summarized in table 2 .",
    "also included in that table are the chip modes used in the observations ( whether 1,2 or 4 chip mode ) and the number of chips from which the extracted data were drawn .",
    "for the gis data a constant extraction radius of 6 arcmin was used .",
    "[ we note that for abell 2142 , the 2 arcmin ( 3 arcmin ) radius region surrounding the x - ray bright seyfert-1 galaxy 1556 + 274 ( offset by @xmath22 arcmin from the x - ray centre of the cluster ) was masked out and excluded from the analysis of the sis ( gis ) data . ]    for the gis observations , and sis observations of clusters in regions of low galactic column density ( @xmath23 ) , background subtraction was carried out using the ` blank sky ' observations of high galactic latitude fields compiled during the performance verification stage of the asca mission . for such data sets ,",
    "the blank - sky observations provide a reasonable representation of the cosmic and instrumental backgrounds in the detectors .",
    "the background data were screened and grade selected in the same manner as the target observations and background spectra were extracted from the same regions of the detectors as the cluster spectra . for the sis observations of clusters in directions of higher galactic column density ,",
    "background spectra were extracted from regions of the chips that were relatively free from foreground cluster emission .    for the sis data ,",
    "response matrices were generated using the ftools sisrmg software . where the spectra covered more than one chip , response matrices were created for each chip , which were then combined to form a counts - weighted mean matrix . for the gis analysis , the response matrices issued by gsfc on 1995 march 6 were used .",

    "reduction of the data was carried out with the starlink asterix package .",
    "x - ray images were created on a @xmath26 arcsec@xmath19 pixel scale , from which centres for the cluster x - ray emission were determined .",
    "where more than one observation of a source was made , a mosaic was constructed from the individual observations . for the cooling flow and intermediate clusters ,",
    "the x - ray centres were identified from the peaks of the x - ray surface brightness distributions ( which are easily determined from the hri images ) . for the non - cooling flow clusters ,",
    "the x - ray emission is not as sharply - peaked and for these systems we have identified the x - ray centres with the results from iterative determinations of the centroids within a circular aperture of fixed radius . for abell 665 , 2163 and ac114",
    "a 1 arcminute radius aperture was used . for abell 2744 ,",
    "773 , 2218 and 2219 a 2 arcmin aperture was adopted , and for abell 520 a 3 arcmin aperture was used . for two of the clusters included in the sample ,",
    "abell 665 and 1413 , rosat hri images were not available at the time of writing and for these clusters pspc imaging data have been used instead . a summary of the rosat observations and the x - ray centers for the clusters is given in table 3 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we have classified the clusters into subsamples of cooling - flow ( hereafter cf ) and non - cooling flow ( ncf ) systems .",
    "cfs are those clusters for which the upper ( 90 percentile ) limit to the central cooling time , as determined from the deprojection analysis of the rosat hri x - ray images ( section 4 ) , is less than @xmath27 yr .",
    "( the ` central ' cooling time is the mean cooling time of the cluster gas in the innermost bin included in the deprojection analysis , which is of variable size .",

    "the fraction of cfs in our sample is @xmath29 per cent , the same as that determined by peres ( 1998 ) from a study of a larger , flux - limited sample of clusters ( primarily at lower redshift ; @xmath30 ) using a similar classification scheme .",
    "the modeling of the x - ray spectra has been carried out using the xspec spectral fitting package ( version 9.0 ; arnaud 1996 ) . for the sis data , only counts in pulse height analyser ( pha ) channels corresponding to energies between 0.6 and 10.0   were included in the analysis ( the energy range over which the calibration of the sis instruments is best - understood ) .",
    "for the gis data only counts in the energy range @xmath31  were used .",
    "the spectra were grouped before fitting to ensure a minimum of 20 counts per pha channel , allowing @xmath32 statistics to be used .",
    "the spectra have been modeled using the plasma codes of kaastra & mewe ( 1993 ; incorporating the fe l calculations of liedahl , osterheld & goldstein 1995 , in xspec version 9.0 ) and the photoelectric absorption models of balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the data from all four asca detectors were analysed simultaneously ( except where the s1 data were lost due to chip saturation problems ) with the fit parameters linked to take the same values across the data sets .",
    "the exceptions to this were the emission measures of the ambient cluster gas in the four detectors which , due to the different extraction radii used and residual uncertainties in the flux calibration of the instruments , were allowed to fit independently .",
    "the spectra were examined with a series of spectral models .",
    "model a , consisted of an isothermal plasma in collisional equilibrium , at the optically - determined redshift for the cluster , and absorbed by the nominal galactic column density ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model were the temperature ( @xmath33 ) and metallicity ( @xmath34 ) of the plasma and the emission measures in the four detectors .",
    "( the metallicities are measured relative to the solar values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , with the different elements assumed to be present in their solar ratios . )",
    "the second model , model b , was the same as model a but with the absorbing column density @xmath35 also included as a free parameter in the fits .",
    "the third model , model c , was the same as model a but with an additional component explicitly accounting for the emission from the cooling flows .",
    "the material in the cooling flows is assumed to cool at constant pressure from the ambient cluster temperature , following the prescription of johnstone ( 1992 ) .",
    "the normalization of the cooling - flow component was parameterized in terms of a mass deposition rate , @xmath36 , which was a free parameter in the fits .",
    "the mass deposition rate is linked to take the same value in all four detectors , scaled by a normalization factor proportional to the total flux measured in that detector .",
    "the metallicity of the cooling gas was assumed to be equal to that of the ambient icm .",
    "the emission from the cooling flows was also assumed to be absorbed by an intrinsic column density , @xmath37 , of cold gas which was a further free parameter in the fits .",
    "the abundances of metals in the absorbing material were fixed to their solar values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) although the effects of varying these values were examined .",
    "finally , a fourth spectral model , model d , was examined which was similar to model c but with the constant - pressure cooling flow replaced with a second isothermal emission component .",
    "the temperature and normalization of this second emission component were included as free parameters in the fits .",
    "( as with model c , the normalizations were linked to the same value in all four detectors , scaled by the appropriate normalization factors . )",
    "the second emission component was also assumed to be intrinsically absorbed by a column density of cold gas , @xmath37 , which was a free parameter in the fits .",
    "the metallicities of the two emission components were linked to take the same values .",

    "table 5 summarizes the goodness - of - fit measurements obtained with the different spectral models .",
    "the tabulated results are the probabilities of exceeding the @xmath32 values obtained , assuming in each case that the model correctly describes the spectral properties of the clusters .",
    "goodness - of - fit values @xmath46 may be regarded as indicating a formally unacceptable fit to the data .",
    "the results from the spectral analysis show that model a ( the isothermal model with the absorbing column density fixed at the nominal galactic value ) provides a reasonable description of most ( 21/30 ) of the clusters .",
    "however , model a fails significantly for the massive cf clusters abell 1068 , 1795 , 2029 and 2204 .",
    "the significance of the improvements to the fits obtained with spectral model b over model a have been evaluated using the f - test for the introduction of an additional free parameter ( bevington 1969 ) .",
    "these significances are listed in column 6 of table 5 .",
    "we see that the improvements obtained when including the column density as a free parameter in the fits with the isothermal models are significant at @xmath47 per cent confidence for 23 of the 30 clusters ( and would also be highly significant for abell 478 if the nominal dickey & lockman 1990 value for the galactic column density , rather than the x - ray value determined by allen & fabian 1997 were used in model a ) .",
    "model b provides a statistically acceptable fit for 27 of the 30 clusters .",
    "the results on the goodness - of - fit determined with spectral models c and d are summarized in columns 4 and 5 of table 5 .",
    "the only clusters that these models do not adequately describe are the two nearest , brightest systems ; abell 1795 and abell 2029 .",
    "spectral models c and d include an absorption component acting on the entire cluster emission which is normalized to the appropriate galactic column densities determined from hi studies ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "we have examined the significance of the improvements to the fits obtained when allowing the galactic column density to also be a free parameter in the fits with these models .",
    "the fits were not significantly improved for any of the clusters except pks0745 - 191 , for which the galactic column density is most uncertain .",
    "( the galactic column density to pks0745 - 191 varies between 3.2 and @xmath48  in the surrounding regions studied by dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "we find @xmath49 with model c and @xmath50 with model d for pks0745 - 191 ( indicating improvements significant at @xmath51 per cent confidence ) when allowing the galactic column density to be free .",
    "the preferred value for the galactic column density for this cluster from the asca data is @xmath52 . for abell 1795",
    ", we also find a marginal improvement to the fits with models c and d when allowing the galactic column density to be a free parameter ( @xmath53 with model c and @xmath54 for model d , which is significant at the 96.5 and 98 per cent level , respectively ) with a preferred value of @xmath55 .",
    "the agreement between the galactic column densities inferred from the 21 cm and x - ray data for most of the clusters with spectral models c and d provides further support for the validity of these models .",
    "the statistical improvements obtained by introducing an additional emission component into the fits with the single - temperature model ( model b ) are summarized in columns 7 and 8 of table 5 .",
    "we list the results obtained for both cases , where the extra emission component is modeled as a cooling flow ( for the cf systems only ) or a second isothermal emission component .",
    "( essentially we use spectral models c and d , but also include the galactic column density as a free parameter it the fits so as to permit a direct comparison with the goodness of fit measured with spectral model b ) . the significance of the improvements to the fits obtained with the multiphase models with respect to model b have been quantified using an f - test for the introduction of 2 or 3 extra parameters ( for models c and d respectively ) .",
    "we find that the improvements with model d are significant at @xmath47 per cent confidence for 21 of the 30 clusters .",
    "the only clusters for which we find no significant improvement with the introduction of a second emission component are the ncf clusters abell 520 , 773 , 2218 and ac114 , and the more distant and/or less - luminous cf clusters abell 963 , ms1358.4 + 6245 , ms1455.0 + 2232 , ms2137.3 - 2353 and abell 2390 , which have amongst the lowest numbers of counts in their asca spectra . for the cf clusters ( the only clusters to which model c was applied ) the improvements obtained with the cooling - flow model over model b are significant at @xmath47 per cent confidence in 13 of 21 systems , with again those cf clusters with the lowest numbers of total counts in their asca spectra exhibiting the least - significant improvements .",
    "we thus find that most cf clusters , and a number of ncf systems ( in general those systems with the best signal - to - noise ratios in their asca spectra ) exhibit significant improvements to their fits with the use of multiphase , over single - phase , models .",
    "these improvements generally indicate the presence of emission from material cooler than the mean cluster temperatures ( see table 4 ) . for the cf clusters , this",
    "can be naturally understood as being due to emission associated with the cooling flows . for the ncf clusters , the improvements to the fits obtained with model d are likely to reflect the presence of merging subclusters with lower virial temperatures",
    "this is supported by optical , radio and x - ray imaging ( edge 1992 ; buote & tsai 1996 ; markevitch 1996 ; feretti , giovannini & bhringer 1997 ; rizza 1998 ) and gravitational lensing studies ( kneib 1995 ; smail 1995 , 1997 ; squires 1997 ; allen 1998 ) of the ncf clusters , which show that these systems typically exhibit complex morphologies and centroid shifts indicative of merger events .",
    "the results in table 4 show that spectral model d typically provides at least as good a fit to the asca spectra for the cf clusters as the cooling - flow model ( model c ) .",
    "this has sometimes been taken to indicate that the x - ray gas in these systems is distinctly two - phase , with the cooler phase being due to the dominant cluster galaxy ( makishima 1997 ; ikebe 1999 ) .",
    "however , when interpreting these results it is important to recall that the two - temperature model provides a more flexible fitting parameterization , with an extra degree of freedom , when applied to asca observations .",
    "simulated cooling - flow spectra constructed with spectral model c , including plausible levels of intrinsic absorption ( section 6 ) and observed at the spectral resolution and signal - to - noise levels typical of asca observations , are invariably well - described by two - temperature models .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 where we show a simulated asca sis spectrum for a 7 kev cluster with a metallicity of 0.4@xmath56 , containing a cooling flow ( intrinsically absorbed by a column density of @xmath57 ) accounting for 30 per cent of the total @xmath40 kev flux .",
    "a count rate of 1ct s@xmath58 , an exposure time of 40ks and a galactic column density of @xmath0  have been assumed .",
    "overlaid , we show the best - fitting two - temperature model , which provides a good fit to the simulated data .    thus , even in the case where the constant - pressure cooling flow model provides an exact description of the data ( _ i.e. _ in the simulations ) , the two - temperature model provides a similarly good fit . in a real cluster , where spectral model c will undoubtedly over - simplify the true situation ,",
    "the more flexible two - temperature model ( model d ) is likely to provide a better match to the observations .",
    "thus , our finding that spectral model d often provides a better fit to the observed cluster spectra than model c , only shows that the constant pressure cooling flow model over - simplifies the true spectra of the cooling flows in the clusters ( see also section 6.4 ) .",
    "we note that such tendencies would be enhanced by the presence of additional cool components in the spectra , for example due to temperature gradients at large radii ( markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the very high luminosities associated with the cool emission components in clusters like rxj1347.5 - 1145 ( with @xmath59 a few @xmath11 ) are difficult to explain with models in which the cool emission is due to the interstellar medium of the central cluster galaxies .",
    "the analysis of the hri imaging data has been carried out using an extensively updated version of the deprojection code of fabian ( 1981 ) .",
    "azimuthally - averaged x - ray surface brightness profiles were determined for each cluster from the hri images .",
    "these profiles were background - subtracted , corrected for telescope vignetting and re - binned to provide sufficient counts in each annulus to allow the analysis to be extended to radii of at least 500 kpc .",
    "( bin sizes of 8 - 24 arcsec were used . )    with the x - ray surface brightness profiles as the primary input , and under assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium , the deprojection technique can be used to study the basic properties of the intracluster gas ( temperature , density , pressure , cooling rate ) as a function of radius . the deprojection code uses a monte - carlo method to determine the statistical uncertainties on the results and incorporates the appropriate hri spectral response matrix issued by gsfc .",
    "the cluster metallicities were fixed at the values determined from the spectral analysis ( table 4 ) .",
    "the absorbing column densities were fixed at the appropriate galactic values ( table 1 ) .",
    "the deprojection code requires the total mass profiles for the clusters ( which define the pressure profiles ) to be specified .",
    "we have iteratively determined the mass profiles that result in deprojected temperature profiles ( which approximate the mass - weighted temperature profiles in the clusters ) that are isothermal within the regions probed by the hri data ( the central @xmath60 mpc ) and which are consistent with the spectrally - determined temperatures ( section 3 ) .",
    "the assumption of approximately isothermal mass - weighted temperature profiles in the central regions of the clusters is supported by the following evidence : firstly , asca observations of nearby cooling flows show that in the central regions of these systems the gas is multiphase , but that the bulk of the x - ray gas there has a temperature close to the cluster mean ( fabian 1994b ; fukazawa 1994 ; matsumoto 1996 ; ikebe 1999 ) .",
    "secondly , combined x - ray and gravitational lensing studies of cf clusters ( allen 1998 ) show that approximately isothermal mass - weighted temperature profiles in the cores of such clusters lead to excellent agreement between their x - ray and gravitational - lensing masses .",
    "thirdly , the use of approximately constant mass - weighted temperature profiles implies a more plausible range of initial density inhomogeneities in the clusters than would be the case if the temperature profiles decreased within their cores ( thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 ) .",
    "finally , the use of approximately isothermal mass - weighted temperature profiles in the deprojection analyses leads to independent determinations of the mass deposition profiles in the cooling flows , from the x - ray spectra and imaging data , in excellent agreement with each other ( allen & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the assumption of a constant mass - weighted deprojected temperature profile is consistent with measurements of a decreasing emission - weighted temperatures in the cores of many cf clusters ( waxman & miralda - escud 1995 ) .",
    "the mass profiles for the clusters were parameterized as isothermal spheres ( equation 4 - 125 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) with adjustable core radii ( @xmath61 ) and velocity dispersions ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the core radii were adjusted until the temperature profiles determined from the deprojection code became isothermal .",
    "the velocity dispersions were then adjusted until the temperatures determined from the deprojection code came into agreement with the spectrally - determined values .",
    "errors on the velocity dispersions are the range of values that result in isothermal deprojected temperature profiles that are consistent , at the 90 per cent confidence limit , with the spectrally - determined temperature results .",
    "estimates of the thermal gas pressure in the outermost radial bins used in the analysis are also required by the deprojection code and were determined iteratively .",
    "( the uncertainties on the outer pressure estimates do not significantly affect the results presented here . )",
    "although the deprojection method of fabian ( 1981 ) is essentially a single - phase technique , we note that it produces results in good agreement with more detailed multiphase treatments ( thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 ) and , due to its simple applicability at large radii in clusters , is better - suited to the present project .",
    "the mass distributions determined from the deprojection analysis are summarized in columns 3 and 4 of table 6 .",
    "these simple parameterizations permit direct comparisons with independent mass constraints from gravitational lensing and dynamical studies ( allen 1998 ) .",
    "we note that for a few of the clusters ( primarily the brightest cfs with the best data ) the single - component mass models can not adequately satisfy the requirement for approximately isothermal deprojected temperatures profiles and for these systems a significantly better match was obtained by introducing a second ` linear ' mass component , truncated at a specified outer radius .",

    "the central surface brightness peaks in cf clusters trace the presence of sharp central density rises in these systems and are not only the result of excess emission due to cooling gas .",
    "( it is the high central densities that lead to the high cooling rates . )",
    "although fully accounting for the effects of cooling on the central density measurements is difficult with current data , simply excising the inner regions of the clusters can lead to overestimates of the mass core radii and corresponding underestimates of the central gas and total mass densities .",

    "the spectral and image deprojection analyses discussed in sections 3 and 4 provide essentially independent estimates of the mass deposition rates in the clusters .",
    "a comparison of the results obtained from these analyses therefore provides a test of the validity of the cooling flow model .",
    "the deprojection method describes the x - ray emission from a cluster as arising from a series of concentric spherical shells .",

    "the second term is the gravitational work done on the gas deposited in shell @xmath74 .",

    "since the cooling time of this material will be short compared to the flow time , the cooling can be assumed to take place at a fixed radius .",
    "thus , the luminosity contributed by the first term in equation 1 should have a spectrum that can be approximated by gas cooling at constant pressure from the ambient cluster temperature the same spectrum as the cooling component incorporated into the spectral analysis with model c ( section 3 ) .",
    "for the bulk of the material continuing to flow inwards towards the cluster centre , the cooling via x - ray emission is assumed to be offset by the gravitational work done on the gas as it moves inwards .",
    "the emission accounted for in the second and third terms of equation 1 should therefore have a spectrum that can be approximated by an isothermal plasma at the appropriate ambient temperature for the cluster the spectrum of the isothermal emission component in model c. since the mass - weighted temperature profiles in the clusters are assumed to remain approximately isothermal with radius , the luminosity contributed by the fourth term of equation [ swa_eq1 ] should be negligible .",
    "the mass deposition rates , @xmath81 , listed in table 6 are the mass flow rates ( @xmath82 ) determined from the deprojection analysis , at the point where the mean cooling time of the cluster gas first exceeds the hubble time ( @xmath83 yr ) .",
    "thus , if the cooling flow model is correct , and the cooling flows have been undisturbed for a significant fraction of a hubble time , the mass deposition rates determined from the deprojection analysis should be similar to those measured independently from the spectral data .",
    "3 shows the mass deposition rates determined from the spectral analysis ( @xmath39 ) versus the image deprojection results ( @xmath81 ) , for those clusters for which both quantities have been measured .",
    "we see that the results exhibit an approximately linear correlation ; a fit to the data with a power - law model of the form @xmath84 , using the akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) bisector modification of the ordinary least - squares statistic , gives a best - fitting power - law slope of @xmath85 ( where the error is the standard deviation determined by bootstrap re - sampling ) , although the spectrally - determined mass deposition rates typically exceed the deprojection results by a factor of @xmath86 .",

    "the fraction of the x - ray flux from a cluster due to it s cooling flow can be expected to increase with the age of the flow .",
    "it is therefore likely that the cooling flows in abell 1689 and 2142 are younger than those in abell 2204 and zwicky 3146 .",
    "we note that the x - ray data are not , in general , of sufficient quality to place firm constraints on the ages of the cooling flows in these clusters ( for a discussion of cooling flow age measurements see allen 1999 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the clusters with the largest cooling - flow flux fractions ( with the exception of abell 1413 and 2261 ) are also amongst the most optically line - luminous cooling flows known ( crawford 1999 ) .",
    "the production of powerful optical emission lines and associated uv / blue continuum emission is known to be due , at least in part , to the formation of massive stars at the centres of cooling flows ( johnstone , fabian & nulsen 1987 ; allen 1995 ; cardiel 1995 , 1998 ; mcnamara 1996 ; voit & donahue 1997 ) .",
    "the results presented here are consistent with the idea that such star formation is typical of undisturbed cooling flows .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the clusters with the largest cooling flow flux fractions and most optically line - luminous emission line nebulae also tend to have the shortest cooling times averaged over their central 100 kpc regions , with @xmath94gyr ( see also peres 1998 ) .",
    "the equivalent column densities of intrinsic x - ray absorbing material inferred from the spectral analysis are summarized in table 9 .",
    "all three of the spectral models incorporating a free - fitting absorption component ( models b , c , d ) reveal the presence of excess x - ray absorption over and above the nominal galactic values along the lines of sight to the clusters ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , although the measured column densities are sensitive to the spectral model used .    using the simple isothermal model with free - fitting absorption ( model b ) , we determine a mean excess column density for the whole sample of 30 clusters of @xmath95 .",
    "when we examine the cf and ncf clusters separately , we find that both subsamples exhibit intrinsic absorption , at a similar level on average . for the cf clusters , the mean excess column density measured with spectral model b is @xmath96 . for the ncf systems ,",
    "the value is @xmath97 .",
    "the application of a students t - test ( accounting for the possibility of unequal variances in the two distributions ; press 1992 ) shows the mean excess column densities for the cf and ncf clusters , determined with spectral model b , to differ at only the 45 per cent confidence level .",
    "the application of a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows the two subsamples to be drawn from different parent populations at only the @xmath92 per cent confidence level .",
    "thus , our analysis with spectral model b suggests that intrinsic absorption is not confined to cf clusters .",
    "the results on the column densities are quite different , however , when the more - sophisticated multiphase spectral models are used .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , the multiphase models generally provide a better description of the x - ray properties of the cf clusters ( and some of the brighter ncf systems ) . using spectral model c , our preferred model for the cf clusters in",
    "that it provides a consistent description of the spectral and imaging x - ray data for these systems ( section 5.1 ) , we determine a mean intrinsic column density acting on the cooling - flow components of @xmath98 . using the two - temperature spectral model ( model d ) , we determine a mean intrinsic column density acting on the cooler emission components in the cf systems of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the intrinsic column densities for the cf clusters measured with the multiphase models ( models c and d ) are similar and approximately an order of magnitude larger than the values inferred using the single - phase model b. these results demonstrate the need for adopting an appropriate spectral when attempting to measure the column densities of absorbing material in cf clusters .",
    "we also note that where spectral model d provided a significant improvement to the fits to the ncf clusters , with respect to model b , the measured column densities acting on the cooler emission components were also significantly larger than the values determined using the single - phase models .",
    "we have also measured the intrinsic column densities in the cf clusters using one further spectral model , referred to in table 9 as model c. model c is identical to model c except that it assumes that the excess absorption acts on the entire cluster spectrum , rather than just the cooling gas , and that the absorbing material lies at zero redshift .",
    "model c has been used in a number of previous studies and is included here for comparison purposes . the mean excess column density for the cf clusters determined with spectral model c",

    "allen & fabian ( 1997 ) present results from an x - ray colour deprojection study of 18 clusters observed with the rosat pspc .",
    "these authors determine intrinsic column densities across the central 30 arcsec ( radius ) regions of abell 478 , 1795 and 2029 , using spectral model c , of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the results for abell 478 and abell 1795 are in excellent agreement with those presented here , although the allen & fabian ( 1997 ) value for abell 2029 is @xmath22 times smaller than our result .",
    "abell 2029 is unusual in that it hosts a strong cooling flow without associated optical line emission .",
    "this may indicate that the central regions of the cluster have been disrupted ( perhaps by a minor merger event or the strong central radio source in this system ) , complicating the distributions of cooling and absorbing material ( _ cf .",
    "_ section 5.2 ) .",
    "four of the cf clusters studied here were also examined by white ( 1991 ) , using einstein observatory sss data .",
    "these authors measured intrinsic column densities for abell 478 , 1795 , 2029 and 2142 ( in a 3 arcmin radius circular aperture , using spectral model c ) of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",

    "allen & fabian ( 1997 ) compared the results from their x - ray colour deprojection study of pspc data with the white ( 1991 ) sss analysis and concluded that if the intrinsic absorption were due to cold gas , then agreement between the measured column densities could only be obtained if the covering fraction of the x - ray absorbing material were , in general , @xmath109 .",
    "we have therefore examined the constraints on the covering fraction , @xmath110 , that can be obtained from the asca data using spectral model c. the results are also listed in table 9 . in all cases",

    "can be firmly ruled out .",
    "( the physical significance of these results are further explored in section 6.4 ) .",
    "the results on the covering fractions , and the reasonable agreement of the asca and pspc results for abell 478 and 1795 , suggest that the white ( 1991 ) results may have systematically over - estimated the intrinsic column densities in clusters by a factor of a few .    before considering in more detail the possible origin and nature of the absorbing material ,",
    "it is pertinent to consider whether the intrinsic absorption , inferred to be present using a variety of spectral models , could in fact be an artifact due to an unconsidered emission process in the clusters .",
    "5 shows the sis0 spectra for abell 1068 and 1795 , which exhibit two of the clearest absorption signatures .",
    "the data between @xmath112 and @xmath113 kev have been fitted with a single - temperature emission model with galactic absorption ( _ i.e. _ spectral model a ) .",
    "the residuals to these fits , over the full @xmath88 kev band , are shown in the lower panels .",
    "we see that the residuals , which can be naturally explained by the introduction of cool emission components with associated intrinsic absorption ( using spectral models c and d ) , take the form of a large excess of counts between @xmath114 kev .",
    "we therefore include the caveat that if some extra emission process which can account for such residuals in the x - ray spectra were identified , then the requirement for intrinsic absorption from the x - ray data would be greatly diminished .",
    "finally , we note that the fits with spectral model a over the restricted @xmath115 energy range lead to determinations of the cluster temperatures for abell 1068 and 1795 of @xmath116 and @xmath117 kev , respectively , in excellent agreement with the results obtained for the full data sets with spectral model c.      the results presented in section 6.1 show that the cooling flows in our sample are typically intrinsically absorbed by equivalent hydrogen column densities of a few @xmath118  ( taking spectral model c as our preferred model ) .",
    "assuming , in the first case , that this absorption is due to cold gas with solar metallicity , the mass of absorbing gas , @xmath119 , within a radius , @xmath120 , may be approximated as    @xmath121    where @xmath120 is in units of kpc and @xmath37 in @xmath1 . for metallicities of @xmath122  in the absorbing gas ( the mean emission - weighted value for the x - ray emitting gas in the cf clusters ; allen & fabian 1998b )",

    "the implied masses of absorbing material are in reasonable agreement with the masses expected to have been accumulated by the cooling flows over their lifetimes ( section 6.2 ) , identifying this material as a plausible sink for the bulk of the cooled gas from the flows . despite the evidence for intrinsic x - ray absorption associated with cooling flows , however , searches for this material in other wavebands have , to date , proved largely unsuccessful ( at least outside of the central @xmath166 kpc ) . we here briefly review these observations and comment on their implications for the physical state of the x - ray absorbing matter .",
    "more detailed discussions of a number of these issues are given by ferland , fabian & johnstone ( 1994 ) , daines , fabian & thomas ( 1994 ) , fabian ( 1994a ) , odea ( 1994a ) , voit & donahue ( 1995 ) , odea & baum ( 1996 ) , arnaud & mushotzky ( 1988 ) and henkel & wiklind ( 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 5.2 , the central ( @xmath166 kpc ) regions of cf clusters are commonly observed to be sites of ongoing star formation with powerful , associated optical line emission ( johnstone 1987 ; heckman 1989 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1989 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ; allen 1995 ; cardiel 1995 , 1998 ; mcnamara 1996 ; voit & donahue 1997 ; crawford 1999 ) . nearly all cf clusters with short central cooling times ( @xmath167gyr ) exhibit such phenomena ( peres 1998 ) , whereas systems with longer central cooling times ( including all ncf clusters ) generally do not .",
    "the observed levels of star formation imply the presence of at least moderate masses of cooled gas in the cores of cf clusters , sufficient in a few cases to account for the bulk of the mass deposited by the cooling flows in those regions ( allen 1995 ) and at least some causal connection with the cooling flows .    at radio wavelengths ,",
    "extensive searches have been carried out for 21 cm line - emission associated with warm atomic hydrogen in the cores of cf clusters ( valentijn & giovanelli 1982 ; odea & baum 1996 ) .",
    "the negative results obtained ( with the exception of m87 ; jaffe 1992 ) typically constrain the column densities of optically thin material to be less than a few @xmath168  and , for an assumed spin temperature , @xmath169k , the number of clouds along the line of sight to be @xmath170 ( odea & baum 1996 ) .",
    "searches have also been made for the 21 cm absorption signature of cold atomic hydrogen ( mcnamara , bregman & oconnell 1990 ; jaffe 1992 ; dwarakanath , van gorkom & owen 1994 ; odea , gallimore & baum 1995 ; odea & baum 1996 ; johnstone 1998 ) .",
    "such material has been detected across the central few kpc of a few cf clusters , including abell 426 ( crane , van der hulst & haschick 1982 ; sijbring 1989 ; jaffe 1990 ) 2a0335 + 096 ( mcnamara 1990 ) , hydra a ( dwarakanath , van gorkom & owen 1995 ) , mkw3s ( mcnamara 1990 ) and abell 2597 ( odea , baum & gallimore 1994 ) with typical column densities of a few @xmath171 .",
    "however , for most clusters only negative results have been obtained , with upper limits to the column densities of 10k gas ( assuming a covering fraction of unity and a velocity width of @xmath172 kms@xmath58 ; dwarakanath 1994 , odea & baum 1996 ) of @xmath173 .",
    "laor ( 1997 ) presents tight limits on the column density of atomic hydrogen towards the core of abell 426 ( @xmath174 ) from ly@xmath175 observations made with the hubble space telescope ( see also johnstone & fabian 1995 ) . together , the results on hi emission and absorption , and ly@xmath175 absorption , imply that the bulk of the material responsible for the observed x - ray absorption can not be in the form of atomic hydrogen .",
    "an issue of crucial importance in interpreting the 21 cm hi results and the results from co studies ( see below ) is the expected temperature of x - ray absorber , if in gaseous form , which has proved controversial .",
    "johnstone , fabian & taylor ( 1998 ; updating earlier calculations by ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 and fabian 1994a ) suggest that cooled gas clouds , in equilibrium with the cooling - flow environment , are likely to be very cold .",
    "johnstone ( 1998 ) suggest that dust - free clouds form an extended outer envelope , with a column density of @xmath176 and a temperature of 13 - 17k , beyond which the gas drops to the microwave background temperature . for galactic dust / gas ratios , however , the results are significantly modified , such that the cloud temperature drops to the microwave background temperature after a column density of only @xmath177 . at such low temperatures ,",
    "dusty gas is likely to be highly molecular .",
    "however , these predictions differ from those of odea ( 1994a ) and voit & donahue ( 1995 ) who suggest a minimum temperature for such clouds of @xmath178k , even in the presence of dust .",
    "braine ( 1995 ) also suggest a minimum temperature of @xmath179k for the absorbing gas .",
    "possible reasons for the discrepancies between these results ( with contrasting views ) are discussed by voit & donahue ( 1995 ) and ferland ( in preparation ) .",
    "extensive searches have been carried out for co associated with molecular gas in cooling flows .",
    "to date co emission has only been detected in abell 426 ( lazareff 1989 ; mirabel , sanders d.b .",
    "& kazs i. 1989 ) .",
    "braine ( 1995 ) also present limits on co absorption in the central regions of this cluster ) .",
    "the upper limits to the column density of molecular hydrogen in the inner regions of other clusters ( for an assumed kinetic temperature of @xmath180k and a covering fraction of unity ) are typically @xmath181 a few @xmath0 ( odea 1994a , antonucci & barvainis 1994 , mcnamara & jaffe 1994 ; braine & dupraz 1995 ; odea & baum 1996 ) which is significantly below the x - ray inferred column densities . the co results also constrain the number of clouds along the line of sight ( for @xmath180k ) to be @xmath182 ( odea 1994a ; odea & baum 1996 ) .",
    "the co emission limits appear to exclude the possibility of large column densities ( _ i.e. _ values consistent with the x - ray measurements ) of molecular gas , with a kinetic temperature @xmath183k .",
    "however , if the bulk of the x - ray gas cools to the microwave background temperature , as suggested by johnstone ( 1998 ) , the co limits may be consistent with the x - ray data .",
    "it should be noted that the determinations of molecular hydrogen masses from co observations are affected by a number of additional uncertainties .",
    "firstly , the co / h@xmath184 ratios in cluster cooling flows may differ from galactic values .",
    "in particular , where the temperature and metallicity of the absorbing gas is low , the use of a standard galactic co / h@xmath184 ratio may underestimate the mass of molecular gas ( maloney & black 1988 ; madden 1997 ) .",
    "it is unclear whether x - ray absorbing gas accumulated by cooling flows could have substantially sub - solar metallicity .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1998b ) determine a mean emission - weighted metallicity for the x - ray emitting gas in cf clusters of @xmath185 .",
    "these authors also show that cf clusters generally contain metallicity gradients , so that the metallicity of the x - ray gas within the cooling radii of cf systems will , on average , exceed this value .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the material currently being deposited from the cooling flows will have substantially sub - solar metallicities .",
    "however , if the x - ray absorbing material is formed from the matter deposited by the cooling flows over their lifetimes , the metallicity of this material could be somewhat lower . within an inhomogeneous cooling flow ( nulsen 1986 , 1998 ; thomas , fabian & nulsen 1987 )",
    "the denser gas at any particular radius will tend to have a smaller volume filling factor .",
    "if the metals are evenly distributed throughout the volume of the cooling flow at any particular radius ( whether this will occur is unclear ) , the least dense gas will contain most of the metals ( reisenegger , miralda - escud & waxman 1996 ) . since the densest material in cooling flows will have the shortest cooling time and be deposited first , the material accumulated by the cooling flows over their histories",
    "could have a significantly lower metallicity than the material being deposited today .",
    "conversely , if the metals in cooling flows were concentrated in the densest material , the metallicity of the x - ray absorbing material could exceed that of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "fabian ( 1994a ) , have suggested that the masses of molecular gas inferred from co observations could be significantly underestimated if most of the co in the absorbing material has frozen onto dust grains .",
    "such freezing should occur rapidly ( on timescales @xmath186 yr ) if even small amounts of dust are initially present in the absorbing gas ( voit & donahue 1995 ) .",
    "daines ( 1994 ) and fabian ( 1994a ) discuss how dust is likely to form even in clouds that are initially free of dust , on timescales @xmath187 yr ( although see also voit & donahue 1995 ) .",
    "optical , uv and sub - mm studies of the cores of cooling flows show that dust lanes ( sparks , macchetto & golombek 1989 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1992 ) and intrinsic reddening ( hu 1992 ; allen 1995 ; edge 1999 ) are common .",
    "elston & maloney ( 1994 ) and jaffe & bremer ( 1997 ) report detections of h@xmath184(1 - 0)s(1 ) emission from warm ( @xmath188k ) molecular hydrogen from k - band spectroscopy of the inner few kpc of a number of cf systems ( including abell 478 and and pks0745 - 191 ) .",
    "no detections of such emission have been made in ncf systems .",
    "the h@xmath184s emission is likely to arise from the heated skin of cold molecular clouds which could also be responsible for the optical emission - line phenomena discussed above .",
    "a final possibility , first discussed in detail by voit & donahue ( 1995 ; see also arnaud & mushotzky 1998 ) , is that the x - ray absorption could be due to dust , with little or no associated gas .",
    "the k - absorption edge of oxygen is a primary source of x - ray absorption and its signature is fairly insensitive to the physical state of the oxygen , so long as it is not highly ionized .",
    "the introduction of a simple oik absorption edge at @xmath189 kev in the asca analysis ( such as might be associated with oxygen - rich , silicate dust grains ) typically provides at least as good a model for the intrinsic absorption as a cold gaseous absorber .",
    "arnaud & mushotzky ( 1998 ) have shown that @xmath190 kev broad band x - ray telescope data for the perseus cluster require excess absorption which is significantly better - explained by a simple oxygen absorption edge ( which they associate with dust ) than by a cold , gaseous absorption model .",
    "verification of this important result will be possible in the near future using observations made with the chandra observatory and xmm .",
    "optical and uv spectroscopy of the central emission - line nebulosities in cooling flows indicate the presence of significant amounts of dust ( hu 1992 ; allen 1995 ; crawford 1999 ) .",
    "allen ( 1995 ) also show that the column densities of absorbing gas inferred from the optical reddening studies are in reasonable agreement with the x - ray values , for galactic dust / gas ratios .",
    "the infrared observations reported here and elsewhere , together with the sub - mm results of edge ( 1999 ) , require the presence of significant dust masses in the core regions of at least a few nearby and/or exceptionally massive cooling flows ( for which the best data exist ) and are consistent with dust being a common feature of cf clusters . limits on background counts of galaxies and quasars behind clusters are consistent with extinctions ranging from @xmath191 ( boyle , fong & shanks 1988 ; romani & maoz 1992 ) , although measurements of galaxy colours in nearby clusters constrain the reddening on cluster - wide scales to be @xmath192 mag ( ferguson 1993 ) .",
    "voit & donahue ( 1995 ) argue that the levels of dust required to account for the observed x - ray absorption are unlikely to lie entirely within the cores of the clusters , and should be distributed more widely throughout the cluster gas .",
    "rosat results on the spatial distribution of the x - ray absorbing material ( allen & fabian 1997 ) show it to be centrally concentrated within the cooling radii of clusters and possibly be confined within cooling flows",
    ". however , the x - ray data are also consistent with a scenario in which the absorbing material is distributed in a manner similar to the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "8(a ) , where we show the equivalent column densities of hydrogen ions in the x - ray emitting gas through two simulated clusters ; one cf and one ncf system .",
    "the gas distributions have been modeled as isothermal spheres , with core radii of 50 and 300 kpc , respectively ( and have been normalized to provide total x - ray gas masses within 3mpc of the cluster centres of @xmath193 ) .",
    "we see that the distribution of x - ray emitting gas is much more centrally concentrated in the cf system , particularly within the central @xmath134 kpc .",
    "8(b ) shows the corresponding x - ray absorbing column densities as a function of radius ( as would be determined from observations with asca - like ccd detectors in the @xmath88 kev band ) in the case where the intracluster gas has an equivalent metallicity in dust grains of @xmath194 solar . for simplicity , we assume that the dust has an absorption spectrum in the asca band similar to that of metal - rich cold gas ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ; qualitatively similar results are obtained for an oxygen edge at 0.54 kev ) . we also assume that the absorber follows a multilayer distribution within the x - ray emitting medium , but is modeled as a uniform absorbing screen in front of the emitting regions .",
    "the results imply mean emission - weighted column densities ( where we assume the x - ray emissivity to be proportional to square of the gas density ) of @xmath195  for the cf cluster , and a few @xmath196  for the ncf system .",
    "( the absolute results on the excess column densities will depend upon the chemical composition of the dust ) .",
    "we thus see that if the x - ray absorption is due to dust , with a spatial distribution that follows the x - ray gas , then we can expect absorption signatures to be present in both cf and ncf clusters , but to be stronger in cf systems ( assuming in each case that an appropriate spectral model is used in the analysis ) .",
    "we would also expect the absorption to be concentrated towards the cores of cf clusters , in agreement with the observations .",
    "we note that if the x - ray absorption were entirely due to a pre - existing distribution of dust grains distributed throughout the clusters , then the agreement between the observed masses of absorbing matter ( calculated assuming that the absorption is due to cold gas confined within the cooling flows ) and the masses predicted to have been accumulated by the cooling flows over their lifetimes ( fig .",
    "6 ) must be regarded as coincidence .",
    "however , it remains possible that both material accumulated by the cooling flows and a more extended distribution of large dust grains ( presumably due to supernovae enrichment at early epochs ) could contribute to the x - ray absorption .",
    "the lifetime of grains of radius @xmath197 m to sputtering in hot gas of density @xmath145 is @xmath198 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "provided that individual grains exceed 10@xmath199 m in radius , they should survive for a hubble time or longer throughout ncf clusters and beyond the cooling radius in clusters with cooling flows . within cooling flows ,",
    "the gas density rises inward so the grains are increasingly sputtered , releasing the metals into the gas phase which thus becomes increasingly metal rich towards the cluster centre .",
    "this provides one possible explanation for the abundance gradients inferred to be present in most cf clusters ( allen & fabian 1998b ; see also irwin & bregman 1999 ) .",
    "however , @xmath200 m grains are optically thick to soft x - rays and so some distribution of grain sizes extending to smaller values is required if dust is responsible for the observed x - ray absorption ( laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "we note that the sputtering of small ( @xmath201 m ) grains will significantly modify the reddening law in clusters with respect to the standard galactic relation , reducing the optical / uv reddening ( laor & draine 1993 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the available data from other wavebands provide some support for the large column densities of intrinsic absorbing material inferred to be present from the x - ray data , at least in the innermost regions of cooling flows .",
    "optical and sub - mm observations of star formation in the cores of cf clusters and k - band observations of emission lines from molecular hydrogen suggest that significant masses of dusty , molecular gas are present in the central few tens of kpc of many cf clusters .",
    "the constraints from 21 cm observations suggest that the bulk of the material accumulated by cooling flows can not remain in a long - lived reservoir of atomic hydrogen .",
    "substantial masses of molecular gas may be distributed throughout cooling flows and as yet have avoided detection , but this material must be very cold ( @xmath202k ) and dusty , a possibility that remains controversial . the very large x - ray column densities ( @xmath165 ) required if the absorbing material has a multilayer distribution are probably incompatible with a gaseous absorber .",
    "it remains possible that dust grains , either present in the cooled material deposited by the cooling flows or distributed throughout the clusters in a manner similar to the x - ray gas , may be responsible for much of the observed x - ray absorption .",
    "the main conclusions that may be drawn from this paper may be summarized as follows : 0.2 cm    \\(i ) we have demonstrated the need for multiphase models to consistently explain the spectral and imaging x - ray data for the cf clusters included in our study .",
    "the mass deposition rates from the cooling flows , independently inferred from multiphase analyses of the asca spectra and deprojection analyses of the rosat hri images , exhibit good agreement , especially once the effects of intrinsic x - ray absorption have been accounted for in a consistent manner .",
    "the mass deposition rates from the largest cooling flows exceed 1000 , identifying these as some of the most massive cooling flows known .",
    "\\(ii ) we have confirmed the presence of intrinsic x - ray absorption in the cluster spectra using a variety of spectral models .",
    "the measured equivalent hydrogen column densities are sensitive to the spectral models used in the analysis , ranging from a few @xmath0  for a simple isothermal emission model to a few @xmath1  using our preferred cooling - flow models , assuming in each case that the absorber lies in a uniform foreground screen . both the cf and ncf systems exhibit excess absorption at a similar level ( on average ) when analysed with the same , simple isothermal model .",
    "\\(iii ) the masses of x - ray absorbing material inferred to be present in the cf clusters ( assuming the absorption to be due to cold gas with a covering fraction of unity ) are in reasonable agreement with the masses expected to have been accumulated by the cooling flows over their lifetimes .",
    "\\(iv ) the asca spectra constrain the covering fraction of the absorbing material acting on the cooling flows to be close to ( or exceed ) unity .",
    "if the x - ray absorption is due to many small , similarly - sized clouds along each line of sight , intermixed with the x - ray emitting gas , then the column densities inferred from the spectral analysis may significantly underestimate the true column densities of absorbing material in the cooling flows .",
    "\\(vii ) we have summarized the constraints on the physical properties of the x - ray absorbing material from observations in other wavebands .",
    "substantial 60 and 100@xmath199 m fluxes , sufficient to account for the bolometric luminosities absorbed and reprocessed within the clusters , are detected from several of the largest cooling flows .",
    "optical observations of star formation in the cores of cooling flows also suggests that significant masses of molecular gas are present in the central few tens of kpc of many cf systems .",
    "constraints from 21 cm observations suggest that the bulk of the material accumulated within the cooling radii can not remain in a long - lived reservoir of atomic hydrogen .",
    "substantial masses of molecular gas may be distributed throughout cooling flows and as yet have avoided detection , although this material must be very cold ( @xmath202k ) , a possibility that remains controversial .",
    "the very large x - ray column densities ( @xmath165 ) required if the absorbing material has a multilayer distribution are probably incompatible with a gaseous absorber .",
    "it remains possible that dust grains , either present in the material accumulated by the cooling flows or distributed more widely in a manner similar to the x - ray gas , may be responsible for much of the x - ray absorption .",
