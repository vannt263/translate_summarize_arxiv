    "galaxy clusters are dark matter haloes which form mainly through the process of gravitational collapse , and so they are expected to be self - similar : small clusters or galaxy groups must be scaled - down versions of the more massive systems .",
    "self - similarity predicts a series of relationships between different cluster observables such as x - ray luminosity @xmath9 , mass @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13 and galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath10 , which are the same in all systems ( kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath10 of the galaxies in a cluster probes the depth and shape of the potential well , assuming that the luminous matter traces reasonably well the dark matter in clusters .",
    "moreover , the intracluster gas emits x rays through a process of thermal bremsstrahlung and its bolometric luminosity @xmath9 is found to be strongly correlated with @xmath10 , as both gas and galaxies share a common potential well ( solinger & tucker 1972 ) .",
    "also , since the x - ray emission can be well modelled by thermal emission of a hot , optically thin plasma , @xmath9 and the plasma temperature @xmath13 must be correlated . finally , because galaxies are embedded in the intracluster medium , a correlation is also expected between the gas temperature @xmath13 and the galaxies velocity dispersion @xmath10 .",
    "self - similar models consider that the only energy source in the cluster comes from the gravitational collapse , predicting the following scaling relations : @xmath14 . whereas there seems to be a general agreement between different measurements that @xmath15 , the measurement of @xmath0 has given somewhat contradictory results so far .",
    "some authors have found that @xmath16 indeed , although with quite large measurement errors or rather small data samples , while others find slopes larger than 4 ( see table [ literature ] ) .",
    "part of the differences in the results could come from different ways of selecting the sample , with a preference for regular clusters in some of these surveys .",
    "it has also been suggested that clusters and groups do not follow the same @xmath17 scaling relation , the latter being flatter than the former ( e.g. mahdavi et al .",
    "2000 , xue & wu 2000 , dellantonio et al .",
    "but there are other measurements contrary to that conclusion ( mahdavi & geller 2001 , mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) .    for more distant clusters ( @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 )",
    "there is some evidence that the slope is also @xmath21 ( borgani et al .",
    "1999 , girardi & mezetti 2001 ) , although only small samples are available at the moment , and more data are needed to reduce the error bars .",
    "there is a clear need of new measurements performed on large samples ( more than 100 clusters ) , selected from a homogeneous dataset .",
    "the largest cluster ( not group ) samples available up to date , on which this kind of study has been performed , are literature compilations combining data from different authors and/or instruments ( for example xue & wu 2000 , mahdavi & geller 2001 ) .",
    "the present work comes to partially fill this gap , as we have a large homogeneous subsample of clusters selected from reflex , a flux - limited x - ray selected cluster catalogue built under well defined selection criteria .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ thedata ]",
    "we give a brief introduction to the reflex catalogue and the way in which the subsample in this paper has been selected .",
    "section [ measurement ] illustrates in detail the process of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 measurements , which lead to the the fitting of the @xmath1 in section [ lxsigma ] . in section [ nosubst ]",
    "we propose the removal of those clusters in the sample which are multiple systems . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we analyse possible biases due to the nature of the selected sample .",

    "the reflex ( rosat - eso flux - limited x - ray ) cluster survey ( bhringer et al 2001 , bhringer et al 2003 in preparation , guzzo et al .",
    "2003 in preparation ) has identified and measured successfully the redshift for all southern galaxy clusters ( at galactic latitude @xmath26 ) down to a flux limit @xmath27 erg s@xmath3 @xmath28 in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "this sample has already provided us with results concerning the measurement of the cluster x - ray luminosity function at low redshift ( bhringer et al 2002 ) , the power spectrum ( schuecker et al . 2001a ) , the spatial correlation function ( collins et al . 2000 ) , the measurement of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( schuecker et al .",
    "2003a ) or the measurement of the equation of state parameter @xmath31 of the dark energy ( schuecker et al .",
    "2003b ) , among others . a detailed description of the sample construction can be found in bhringer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "reflex is an x - ray selected sample and the first compilation of the reflex catalogue includes 452 clusters down to a flux limit of @xmath32 erg s@xmath3 @xmath28 in the rosat energy band from 0.1 to 2.4 kev .",
    "the survey covers a total area in the sky of 4.24 ster .",
    "two regions corresponding to the magellanic clouds and the galactic plane have been excluded because of the difficulties in identifying clusters of galaxies in these densely crowded regions , as well as some strips of the sky which were not observed by rosat due to power - off of the detector when the satellite was crossing the earth s radiation belts ( see figure 2 in bhringer et al 2001 for a survey exposure map ) .",
    "optical follow - up has been performed through long - slit and multi - object spectroscopy at the 1.5 m , 2.2 m and 3.6 m eso telescopes at la silla ( chile ) during a series of observing campaigns , which started back in 1991 .",
    "we complement our sample of galaxy redshifts by looking into the literature ( using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database , ned ) and adding those redshifts already published for the previously known clusters .",
    "the cluster membership of each individual galaxy has been decided based on the search for velocity peaks in the velocity distribution of the galaxies observed in the field .",
    "all galaxies were assigned the same weight in the computation of the cluster s median redshift because in most cases not enough photometric material is available to give proper weights ( i.e. to identify a real cd galaxy ) . anyway , bright cluster galaxies ( if present ) were used to decide on the main redshift of the system when it showed multiple velocity peaks in the redshift histogram along the line of sight . in other cases the choice among multiple velocity peaks was decided taking into account the correlation between the peak position and the x - ray emission centre and also the strength of the peak .",
    "finally , other clusters ended up being split into different systems when multiple x - ray emission centres associated to them were detected .    we have selected from reflex those clusters with more than seven measured galaxy redshifts ( see fig . [ z_per_clu ] ) , including only galaxies at a maximum projected distance from the cluster center of 0.5 h@xmath33 mpc , due to the lack of data at larger distances from the cluster centre .",
    "outliers in the velocity space were rejected by applying the 3 sigma clipping method : galaxies with velocity differences with the cluster centre velocity larger than three times the measured velocity dispersion were not used in the subsequent iterations to avoid possible contamination by foreground / background objects . by following this procedure we end up with 171 clusters out of the 452 in the whole catalogue .",
    "it is a low - redshift sample , the median redshift being 0.076 .",
    "only 14 clusters have @xmath18 above 0.2 ( see fig .",
    "[ z_histo ] ) .     is measured . ]",
    "counts in the rosat images were measured using the growth curve analysis ( gca ) and then converted into fluxes , as described in bhringer et al .",
    "luminosities have first been transformed into the rosat rest - frame band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) ( see bhringer et al .",
    "2002 for details ) and afterwards into bolometric luminosities .",
    "we assumed a mekal spectral model with an icm metallicity of 0.3 z@xmath34 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "we used xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) to obtain the relation between the luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band and the bolometric one , as a function of the cluster temperature(see bhringer et al .",
    "2003 for a detailed conversion table ) , which was computed from the velocity dispersions assuming the empirical relation between @xmath10 and t measured by girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the radial velocity dispersions @xmath10 have been computed by means of the biweight estimator of central location and scale ( within rostat by beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "this estimator was first suggested by tuckey ( in andrews et al .",
    "1927 ) as a better way to study non - gaussian or contaminated normal distributions than the gaussian estimators ( mean and standard deviation ) .",
    "the biweight location estimator belongs to the family of estimators known as @xmath12 estimators of location .",
    "it works by minimizing a function of the deviations of each observation from the estimate of location and has the advantage that it does not assume an underlying gaussian distribution , which in our case means to have a perfectly relaxed cluster and might not be the case in most of the sample .",
    "it is less affected by points in the wings of the distribution and is robust for a broad range of non - gaussian underlying populations .",
    "we used the biweight estimator of central location and the gapper estimator of scale ( based on the gaps between order statistics , wainer & thissen , 1976 ) when the number of redshifts available in the cluster was @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    "the biweight estimator was chosen for both location and scale .",
    "errors were obtained in all cases by jacknifing of the biweight .",
    "the choice of the different estimators has been done on the basis of the tests carried out by beers et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for samples with different number of data points .",
    "the usual cosmological correction and the correction for velocity errors ( danese , de zotti & tullio , 1980 ) were also applied .",
    "the whole procedure was performed iteratively until the results converged .",
    "the clusters with the larger errors in the velocity dispersion estimate are among the ones for which @xmath37 .",
    "one source of concern is the fact that we are computing the @xmath10 using galaxies which are quite close to the cluster centre , at distances less than 0.5 h@xmath38 mpc ( median distance is 0.04@xmath38 mpc ) .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that the value of @xmath10 is a function of the distance to the cluster centre , and it reaches a stable value when galaxies at a projected distance of @xmath39 1 h@xmath38 mpc are considered . at smaller distances ,",
    "the @xmath10 does not show a constant behaviour : sometimes it raises up , sometimes it goes down , and in some cases it remains stable .",
    "so , in a large sample like ours we expect that this effect will cancel out . from our current data , it is not possible to determine the @xmath10 at clustercentric distances larger than 0.5 h@xmath38 mpc .",
    "a power law was fit to the @xmath40 relation by means of the orthogonal distance regression method ( odr , boggs et al .",
    "1992 ) , which takes into account errors on both variables .",
    "we took the data in units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 ( @xmath42 ) and velocity dispersions in units of @xmath43 km s@xmath3 ( @xmath44 ) , that is , we put the origin of coordinates more or less at the center of the datapoint cloud to help the model find the right y - axis intercept .",
    "we will use these units throughout the paper , but for table [ literature ] , where we quote @xmath9 in erg s@xmath3 and @xmath10 in km s@xmath3 for comparison purposes with the works referenced there .",

    "the distribution of errors in the sample has been assumed to be normal in the odr fitting . to test for this assumption ,",
    "we have performed a maximum likelihood analysis with sigma clipping to find which is the best fitting gaussian to the actual error distribution in x. as errors in x are far larger than errors in y , we can neglect the effect of the latter .",
    "we find that the best gaussian has central location @xmath54 and standard deviation @xmath55 ( figure [ gaussianity_x_7]).the error distribution along the x axis is thus reasonably gaussian .     and standard deviation @xmath55 . ]",
    "we can also perform a crude estimate of the intrinsic dispersion of the sample , @xmath56 , @xmath57 in error units .",
    "@xmath58 is the best fitting gaussian @xmath59 parameter as found above for the current error distribution , that is @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is the @xmath59 parameter of the error distribution in the ideal case in which only the measurement errors are responsible for the dispersion in the data , which would be a gaussian with @xmath62 .",
    "we find @xmath63 in error units , that is , the intrinsic dispersion of the sample is slightly larger than the dispersion due to the errors in the data .",
    "to see what this means in terms of physical units , let us assume that a typical value of the error in the velocity dispersion is the median of the error distribution , @xmath64 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion is then    @xmath65    finally , to test for the stability of the fitting , we repeated it by removing those points with an error in the velocity dispersion larger than 30 percent of their value .",
    "we find @xmath66 thus showing the robustness of the fitting against the presence of large errors in @xmath10 .",
    "we may also worry about the small number of redshifts ( 7 at minimum ) with which we are computing the @xmath10 in some clusters .",
    "we have repeated the fit , this time taking only clusters for which @xmath10 had been determined from at least 30 individual redshifts . in this way ,",

    "self - similarity in the purely gravitational hierarchical scenario of structure formation implies that for galaxy clusters @xmath14 . although several authors have found a good agreement between this prediction and their measurements for the @xmath17 relation , others have found steeper values ( see table [ literature ] ) .

    "our result is compatible with @xcite and @xcite at about the one - sigma confidence level .    from fig .",
    "[ sigmas_histo ] one can see that our sample is mostly populated by clusters and groups are practically absent , if we consider as `` groups '' those systems with @xmath72 340 km s@xmath3 ( following the criterium used by mahdavi et al .",

    ", they find that clusters show a steeper slope in the @xmath17 relation .",
    "unfortunately , e can not derive a meaningful @xmath17 relation for groups from our sample , due to the small number of groups observed .",
    "the complexity involved in the measurements of @xmath10 and @xmath9 ( because of the presence of substructures , cooling flows , and other physical phenomena ) , the largely unknown intrinsic dispersion of their relationship , and the use of different fitting methods could explain the different results reached by the different works . for example , @xcite illustrate the different results obtained by using odr regression and ordinary least squares ( ols ) regression in the analysis .",
    "substructures in clusters constitute a problem in the radial velocity dispersion estimates , as the different components show different @xmath10 and an estimate of a single @xmath10 for the cluster may not be meaningful .",
    "we can not make a reliable study of the substructures in our clusters as in many cases we do not have enough redshifts to perform it .",
    "the sensitivity for substructure detection depends strongly on the number of galaxies with measured redshift available for each cluster . in our sample , though , we have large differences in the number of galaxies per cluster and trying to detect substructure is not feasible .    in a paper by schuecker",
    "et al ( 2001b ) they identify the clusters in the reflex sample which show multiple components in the x - ray emission .",
    "when we take those clusters out from our sample , we end up with 123 clusters . in this case",
    "we have    @xmath73    which is again in very good agreement with the one obtained for the whole sample .",
    "this result shows that our sample is not largely affected by the problems of substructure , probably because we are selecting galaxies very close to the x - ray peak emission , that is , to the central potential well , where one would expect that the strength of the gravitational potential will erase any substructures which might be present . even in the case of redshifts taken from the literature ( see section [ in_redshifts ] ) we have not considered galaxies farther than 0.5 h@xmath38 mpc , to be consistent with the characteristics of our own data .",
    "the galaxy redshifts used in this work come from three different sources .",
    "when a cluster was already known and well studied , redshifts were taken from the literature , possibly from different authors too .",
    "when a cluster was already known but had little data available in the literature , we took our own redshifts in order to secure and/or improve the cluster redshift .",
    "finally , in the case of clusters discovered in this project , a complete optical follow - up has been carried out .",
    "it is thus not unreasonable to think that such a variety of redshift sources might introduce some undesirable effect particularly on the @xmath10 estimate and therefore in the final @xmath0 relation . to check whether this is the case",
    ", we have restricted ourselves to a sample of 38 clusters for which more than 7 redshifts per cluster were available , all of them being redshifts measured by us from our own data .",
    "this is then to be considered a completely homogeneous sample in terms of both luminosity and redshift , as both quantities have been measured in the same way for all 38 clusters .",
    "the result of the odr fitting is @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the fit is quite poor , probably because this sample suffers from important selection effects .",
    "first , as we have now a small number of data points we should worry about the problems of measuring @xmath10 with galaxies at small projected distance from the cluster centre , as explained in section [ sigma ] .    the minimum number of galaxy redshifts set to measure the @xmath10 may have a role too , specially in this case where not too many clusters are available for the fitting . when we consider the whole sample ,",
    "clusters with smaller number of individual galaxies are given much less weight into the fit than those with a larger number of observed galaxies .",
    "that is not the case here , as all of the clusters show small numbers ( only 3 have more than 15 measured @xmath18 ) , so the differences in the weights are not so dramatic .      of course , we would like to use all 452 clusters in the reflex catalogue to estimate the @xmath0 relation .",
    "this can not be done , unfortunately , as the survey was targeted to measure cluster redshifts and not velocity dispersions in these clusters . while multi - object spectroscopy observations were used for a few distant , compact clusters ( due to the small field of view , 5 arcmin , of the efosc spectrograph on the eso 3.6 m telescope ,",
    "see e.g. guzzo et al .",
    "1999 ) , providing around 15 redshifts per cluster , most of the new reflex cluster redshifts come from ( multiple ) single slit observations which do not deliver enough galaxy redshifts to compute a velocity dispersion , although the main goal was always to have at least 5 spectra per target .",
    "we have compared the @xmath75 distribution for the whole catalogue with the one corresponding to the 171 cluster subsample used in this work .",
    "figure [ lx_z ] shows as filled circles the clusters from the subsample , and as open circles the ones from the whole reflex catalogue .",
    "one can see that both samples are approximately equally distributed .",
    "the results from a kolmogorov - smirnov test are compatible with this conclusion : we find a maximum distance value between the two samples ( the entire catalogue and the 171 cluster sample ) of 0.11 , the probability of this value being larger if coming from a random sample being 0.22 .",
    "distribution for all clusters in the reflex catalogue ( open circles ) and those from the 81 cluster subsample used in this work ( filled circles ) . ]      a bias is expected when measuring the @xmath0 relation from a flux - limited sample .",
    "specifically , at the flux cut - off level only the brightest clusters will be considered , for a given velocity dispersion . as our sample has actually been drawn from a flux - limited sample",
    ", we may worry about whether we are introducing such a bias towards larger luminosities .",
    "this bias can be avoided by considering a volume - limited subsample .",
    "therefore , we have repeated the analysis for the largest volume - limited sample that we could construct from the 171 cluster sample .",

    "these results are consistent ( within the error bars ) with the one obtained for the @xmath0 , as we find @xmath105 when using these @xmath22 and @xmath23 to derive @xmath0 .",
    "the slope found in the @xmath106 relationship is steeper than the value predicted by a purely gravitational collapse model of cluster formation , and is in good agreement with previous measurements performed on other cluster samples . as for the @xmath107 , the slope we find is only compatible with the self - similar value at the three - sigma confidence level , and slightly larger than the value found by other authors . also , if we consider a volume - limited sample , the slope found is then in good agreement with previous studies , yet incompatible with self - similarity .",
    "the fact that this model fails to reproduce the measured slope is attributed to the contribution to the icm energy budget from other non - gravitational heating sources ( see e.g. bialek , evrard & mohr 2002 ) , like agns , supernovae , gas cooling ( pearce et al . 2000 ) , the presence of cool cores ( allen & fabian 1998 ) , or the effect of shocks in cluster formation ( cavaliere et al . 1997 ) .",
    "here we are faced with a paradoxical result : the slope of @xmath108 supports the self - similar scenario , whereas @xmath106 and @xmath23 do not , and all three relations are consistent with each other within one sigma confidence level .",
    "clearly , more data are required to clarify the situation and reduce the error bars .",
    "this is a reflection of the general situation in this topic in the literature : so far there is a general agrement on @xmath106 and @xmath107 , but there is not such an agreement on the @xmath0 .",
