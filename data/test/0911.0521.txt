    "over the last fifteen years there has been consistent theoretical interest in possible small deviations from the exact local lorentz invariance ( li ) of general relativity as well as a flourishing of observational tests .",
    "the theoretical interest is driven primarily by ideas in the quantum gravity ( qg ) community that lorentz invariance may not be an exact local symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "the possibility of outright lorentz symmetry violation ( lv ) or a different realization of the symmetry than in special relativity has arisen in string theory  @xcite , loop qg  @xcite , non - commutative geometry  @xcite , space - time foam  @xcite , some brane - world backgrounds  @xcite , and condensed matter analogues of `` emergent gravity ''  @xcite . as well , allowing the fundamental theory of gravity to be non - relativistic in the ultraviolet can make gravity renormalizable while avoiding some of the other pathologies that plague renormalizable gravitational actions with higher derivative terms  @xcite .",
    "constructing useful tests for the various active models and ideas is therefore vital .",
    "since there are so many theoretical models around , a good approach is to work within a calculable framework where all possible lv terms are parameterized .",
    "each theory then picks out a certain combination of terms which can be constrained . in this vein ,",
    "a standard method is to simply analyze a lagrangian containing the standard model fields and all lv operators of interest that can be constructed by coupling the standard model fields to new lv tensor fields that have non - zero vacuum expectation values .",
    "all renormalizable lv operators that can be added to the standard model in this way are known as the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite .",
    "these operators all have mass dimension three or four and can be further classified by their behavior under cpt .",
    "higher mass dimension operators can be systematically explored as well , which is useful in case the naive eft hierarchy breaks down due to other new physics ( e.g.  susy ) or quantum gravity introducing a custodial mechanism for the renormalizable operators in the infrared .",
    "the cpt odd dimension five kinetic terms for qed coupled to a non - zero vector field were written down in  @xcite while the full set of dimension five operators with a vector were analyzed in  @xcite . the dimension five and six cpt even kinetic terms for qed for particles coupled to a non - zero background vector , which we are primarily interested in here ,",
    "were partially analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the full set of dimension five and six operators for qed has recently been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that susy forbids renormalizable operators for matter coupled to non - zero vectors  @xcite but permits certain nonrenormalizable operators at mass dimension five and six .",
    "many of the parameterized lv operators have been very tightly constrained via direct observations ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "in particular , the dimension five and six cpt even operators for lv with a vector field have been recently directly energies .",
    "susy , however , is an example of new relevant physics that can change this . ] constrained in the hadronic sector by exploiting ultra - high energy cosmic - ray observations @xcite performed by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) .",
    "indeed , the construction and successful operation of this instrument has brought uhecrs to the interest of a wide community of scientists and it is expected to allow , in the near future , the assessment of several problems of uhecr physics and also to test fundamental physics ( in particular lorentz invariance in the qed sector ) with unprecedented precision @xcite .",
    "the uhecr constraints @xcite rely on the behavior of particle reaction thresholds with lv , which are one of the best methods in the eft approach to constrain nonrenormalizable lv operators .",
    "many lv operators give modified dispersion relations for free particles , where the energy as a function of momentum deviates slightly from the special relativistic form . for threshold reactions",
    "what matters is not the size of the lv correction to the energy compared to the absolute energy of the particle , but instead the size of the lv correction to the mass of the particles in the reaction . hence the lv terms usually become important when their size becomes comparable to the mass of the heaviest particle . if the lv term scales with energy as @xmath7 , then this critical energy is @xmath8 @xcite . according to this reasoning",
    ", the larger the particle mass the higher is the energy at which threshold lv effects come into play .",
    "this is why @xmath9 electrons and positrons , but not protons , can be used to constrain @xmath10 lv @xcite , and why uhe protons are needed to obtain constraints on hadronic lv with @xmath11 scaling ( which corresponds to cpt even mass dimension five and six operators ) .",
    "from this point of view , neutrinos , with their tiny mass of order @xmath12 @xcite , are in principle the most suited particles to provide strong constraints on lv , at least for reactions involving _ only _ neutrinos . one such reaction is that of neutrino oscillation .",
    "indeed , for a decade neutrino oscillations have proven to be excellent tests of the sme and other lv models  @xcite as when the lv corrections are near the neutrino mass , the oscillation pattern can change as a function of energy , direction and mass .",
    "icecube may even be able to probe dimension six operators with time of flight techniques with tev neutrinos from distant gamma ray bursts  @xcite .",
    "uhecr experiments have also the capability of placing constraints on sme parameters by exploiting neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "one can construct complementary and in some measures even more sensitive neutrino tests of higher dimension operators by leveraging observables which deviate more strongly from their special relativistic values as the neutrino travel distance increases .",
    "one such observable is found to be related to uhe neutrino spectrum observations .    despite the threshold being low for lv effects to kick in , neutrinos with ultra - high energy",
    "are necessary to achieve a signal , as they interact so weakly that the phase space for a lv reaction must be huge to generate an appreciable rate .",
    "this requirement implies that , since the lv terms and hence the phase space grow with energy , very large energies are needed .",
    "indeed , for renormalizable operators , where the phase space does not grow quickly enough , reactions of the type we consider here never achieve the necessary rate given current bounds on their coefficients , even for uhe neutrinos over cosmological distances  @xcite . however , for the cpt even non - renormalizable operators the situation is different , and we find that for energies of order @xmath4 there can be a significant modification of the spectrum .",
    "next generation neutrino detectors such as anita @xcite and supereuso @xcite are sensitive to neutrinos of energies @xmath13 .",
    "further experiments , like the planned arianna @xcite and iceray @xcite , will cover the range @xmath14 .",
    "in the present work we study how limits on the absolute scale of non - renormalizable cpt even lv neutrino parameters can be obtained from uhe neutrino observations .",
    "in particular we will determine the energy scale where the neutrino spectrum might begin to deviate as a function of the size of the lv coefficients .",
    "with three neutrino species as well as assorted light leptons possibly involved , the spectrum as a function of various lv parameters can only be computed by a detailed parameterized numerical search . at this stage , where lv in this sector is only speculative",
    ", we feel that such a search is unwarranted .",
    "however , we will show the `` best case '' scenario for a lv neutrino signal with dimension six operators as well as a scenario where a signal in the uhe spectrum is much more subtle even though lv is still relatively strong .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : theo ]",
    "we describe the theoretical lv framework in which we will derive the lv effects on the uhe neutrino spectrum . in sections  [ sec :",
    "nulv ] and [ sec : nusplitting ] we will give general information on the standard understanding of uhe neutrino generation by uhecrs , and we will present and detail the main lv reactions possibly affecting their spectrum . section  [ sec : bestcase ] is devoted to present results in our test cases . in section [ sec :",
    "otherprocesses ] we discuss the possible role of other processes than neutrino splitting . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we will report our final remarks and conclusions .",
    "in order to study the phenomenological consequences of lv induced by qg , the existence of a dynamical framework in which to compute reaction thresholds and rates is essential .",
    "we assume that the low energy effects of lv can be parameterized in terms of a local eft . furthermore , for simplicity",
    "we assume that only boost invariance is broken , while rotations are preserved ( see @xcite for further comments on rotation breaking in this context ) .",
    "therefore we introduce lv by coupling standard model fields to a non - zero vector .",
    "more complicated forms could of course be chosen , however this would introduce significant direction dependence . with low statistics already for neutrino observatories , disentangling direction dependence",
    "would be a difficult task .",
    "we focus on the cpt even mass dimension five and six operators involving a vector field @xmath15 ( which we assume to describe the preferred reference frame in which the cmb is seen as isotropic ) coupled to a dirac neutrino @xmath16 in a mass eigenstate with mass @xmath17 that are quadratic in matter fields and hence modify the free field equations . neglecting the left - handed helicity of neutrinos for a moment , the lagrangian for a generic fermion is the usual dirac term plus @xcite @xmath18 } \\psi~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a timelike unit vector describing the preferred frame , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the usual right and left projection operators , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the gauge covariant derivative .",
    "the @xmath24 coefficients are dimensionless .    for fermions , at @xmath25",
    "the helicity eigenstates are almost chiral , with mixing due to the particle mass and the dimension five operators .",
    "since we will be interested in high energy states , we re - label the @xmath24 coefficients by helicity , i.e.  @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting high energy dispersion relation for positive and negative helicity particles can easily be seen from ( [ eq : actionfermion ] ) to involve only the appropriate @xmath27 or @xmath28 terms . for compactness",
    ", we denote the helicity based dispersion by @xmath29 . therefore at high energies we have the dispersion relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have dropped the @xmath33 terms as the @xmath34 operator present in these terms makes the correction to the equations of motion proportional to @xmath35 and hence tiny .",
    "the dimension five fermion operators induce two corrections , one proportional to @xmath36 and one corresponding to a change in the limiting speed of the fermion away from @xmath37 .",
    "the second effect , generated by @xmath38 is naturally of order @xmath39 due to the mass suppression for neutrinos and hence can also be disregarded .",
    "furthermore , we can drop the positive helicity coefficients , as the dominant signal will be from left - handed neutrinos produced by standard model couplings . finally , since cpt is conserved , and neutrinos and antineutrinos exist only in opposite states of helicity , @xmath40 .",
    "all these lovely properties of neutrinos mean we have just one lv coefficient , while in other cases @xcite further assumptions , such as parity preservation , are needed to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "the final dispersion relation we assume in this work for each mass eigenstate neutrinos and antineutrinos is @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the mass eigenstate of the neutrino .",
    "there is no reason why each mass eigenstate needs have the same coefficient , and indeed whether or not they do makes a dramatic difference in the observed spectrum .",
    "in particular , we will study two cases : in the `` flavor blind '' case all the @xmath43 have roughly the same magnitude , which translates in all the lv effects being essentially independent of flavor ; in the `` flavor dependent '' case the @xmath43 are instead different for different mass states , which makes the lv effects depend upon flavor states . among the `` flavor blind '' cases we can find a `` best case '' scenario , in which the effects of lv are maximal , as well as a `` worst case '' scenario , in which lv is present but is ineffective in the context of uhe neutrinos we are discussing now .",
    "a fairly accurate general estimate of the minimum energy in which lv corrections in equation ( [ eq : finaldisp ] ) is relevant is obtained , as stated previously , by comparing the largest mass of the particles entering in the lv reaction with the magnitude of the lv correction in these equations  @xcite . in our case , assuming @xmath44 , the typical energy at which lv contributions start to be relevant is of order @xmath45 , assuming @xmath46 .",
    "this energy of 10 tev allows observatories such as icecube to possibly constrain these operators in the future using neutrino oscillations .",
    "we instead focus on changes to the uhe neutrino spectrum induced by these operators .",
    "if we neglect exotic sources of uhe neutrinos ( as suggested in many top - down models for the production of uhecrs , now disfavored by the current experimental photon limits ) , the `` cosmogenic '' neutrino flux is created @xcite via the decay of charged pions produced by the interaction of primary nucleons with cmb photons above @xmath47 , the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite .",
    "hires @xcite and auger @xcite spectral observations seem to confirm the presence of a gzk suppression in the uhecr spectrum . although the suppression of the uhecr spectrum could be also due to the maximal accelerating power of uhecr sources , the fact that it occurs at just the right energy for being gzk taking place during propagation , and the results @xcite on the correlation of the uhecr arrival directions with the large scale distribution of matter within @xmath48 , seem to favor the gzk explanation . motivated by these considerations",
    ", we make here the hypothesis that the gzk reaction is at work during uhecr propagation .",
    "we have checked numerically that the process of pion decay is not strongly affected by the above lv if only neutrinos are lv .",
    "one might ask in general if lv effects in the hadronic sector , which we have so far neglected , can matter in the production of uhe neutrinos . we can neglect the hadronic sector because of the tight constraints already placed on such lv operators @xcite , which are stronger than what will be considered here .",
    "violation of lorentz invariance however introduces new phenomena in the propagation of uhe neutrinos .",
    "a partial list of these effects includes :    modified @xmath49 oscillations : :    since the lv is parameterized in the mass eigenstate , the lv terms act    as contributions to an effective mass and contribute to neutrino    oscillations .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos are not the right phenomena with    which to study modified oscillations as they have oscillated many    times during their flight from an unknown source , making it extremely    hard to derive oscillation constraints .",
    "icecube and other neutrino    observatories may be sensitive to these operators for atmospheric    neutrinos .",
    "@xmath49-erenkov : :    erenkov radiation in vacuum via charge - radius coupling or gravity :    @xmath50 .",
    "this possibility has been    already investigated for renormalizable operators  @xcite .",
    "the    rate is too small for both renormalizable operators ( at current    limits ) or non - renormalizable operators , even for cosmogenic    neutrinos .",
    "it also involves additional lv coefficients for photon    emission and perhaps new modes for graviton emission  @xcite , thereby    complicating the analysis and , at best , yielding less definitive    limits .",
    "@xmath49-splitting : :    : @xmath51 .",
    "this effect is    what we focus on in the following , as it exclusively involves the    neutrino sector and has a high enough rate to be seen at uh energies . @xmath49-pair",
    "emission : :    : @xmath52 .",
    "here , @xmath53 represents some other fermion    species besides neutrinos .",
    "electrons are the only fermion species    light enough to have an effect compared to @xmath49-splitting    at uh energies .",
    "we initially will ignore this reaction , but we will    consider the possible effects of electron pair and hadronic emission    in section  [ sec : otherprocesses ] .",
    "to understand how a neutrino can split into three , it suffices to calculate the threshold energy for this reaction to occur , which in a lorentz invariant scenario would be infinite .",
    "let us compute the threshold for the decay @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 are neutrinos of mass @xmath57,@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the momenta . in the threshold configuration the momenta of the outgoing particles",
    "are all aligned and parallel to the direction of the incoming neutrino momentum @xcite , hence we choose all momenta to be in the @xmath60-direction .",
    "let @xmath61,@xmath62 and @xmath63 be the fraction of initial momentum carried respectively by the outgoing @xmath55 , by @xmath56 , and by @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for a general dispersion relation with lv term @xmath67 the threshold equation ( the energy conservation equation imposing momentum conservation ) can then be written as @xmath68 = m_{\\nu_a}^{2}\\frac{1-x}{x } + m_{\\nu_b}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{y } + \\frac{1}{t}\\right)~.   \\label{eq : genthres}\\ ] ]    when li is exact , the left hand side vanishes and there is no solution .",
    "with lv , in the simple case where @xmath11 and @xmath69 , we obtain the equation @xmath70    the minimum of the right - hand side in the equation above is 9 and is attained at @xmath71 , hence the threshold energy is given by @xmath72    note that @xmath73 must be positive in order for there to be splitting , i.e.  we must deal with superluminal neutrinos . if @xmath74 then the threshold energy must be solved for numerically as the lv parameter and mass are generically different .",
    "however , the existence of a finite threshold can still be shown for appropriate values of @xmath73 and @xmath75 . in the latter case",
    ", the coefficients do not need to be all positive for there to be a threshold , however it is necessary that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a positive number that depends on the incoming momentum .",

    "] however , for uhe neutrinos it is more difficult to extract constraints , as we shall discuss in section  [ sec : notsogood ] .",
    "neutrinos created in a flavor eigenstate are , of course , a combination of mass eigenstates . in order to maximize the neutrino splitting signal one would want _ all _ mass eigenstates to split ( `` flavor blind '' scenario ) .",
    "the best case scenario is therefore when @xmath81 for each @xmath42 and each @xmath43 is of the same order of magnitude ( so all states begin to decay at the same energy ) . as our best case scenario",
    "then we take @xmath43 equal and positive for all @xmath42 .",
    "let us now consider , within the above  flavor blind scenario \" , energies well above threshold so that neutrinos do effectively split , and the best case combination of the @xmath43 .",
    "the splitting rate can be calculated from the neutrino width @xmath82 where the sum runs over the open splitting channels and @xmath83 represents the partial width for the channel @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath83 is simply @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the phase space of the final states and @xmath87 the matrix element for the process .",
    "the dominant channel for neutrino splitting is via the tree level neutral current interaction .",
    "the matrix element for this interaction is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the charged current electro - weak coupling constant , @xmath90 is the usual spin projector , @xmath91 is the weinberg angle and @xmath92 represent the 4-momentum components of the @xmath93 boson .",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 are the spinors associated with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , their functional form can be found in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath96 is at most the order of @xmath97 and hence for any incoming momenta @xmath98 @xmath99 . after some brute force algebra",
    ", we end with @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the angle between incoming and outgoing @xmath55 and @xmath102 is a complicated function of @xmath101 .",

    "temporarily , we will set @xmath109 and re - insert it at the end .",
    "we first assume that the opening angle for all three neutrinos is roughly equal , as is true over most of phase space . in this case",
    ", @xmath102 can be approximated as @xmath110 .",
    "the opening angle @xmath101 vanishes as @xmath111 , and is small even for uhe neutrinos .",
    "@xmath102 then reduces to @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , @xmath101 is given by the typical transverse momenta @xmath113 divided by the longitudinal momenta @xmath114 .",
    "the characteristic size of @xmath113 can be estimated by energy conservation , recognizing that when energy is conserved any `` excess '' energy from lv goes into the energy needed to create transverse momenta .",
    "formally this implies that @xmath115 i.e. @xmath116 . @xmath114 itself for any particle can range from almost 0 to almost the initial energy @xmath117 well above threshold .",
    "the available phase space volume for the remaining outgoing particles can therefore be approximated ( although somewhat overestimated ) as a cylinder with length @xmath117 and radius @xmath118 , which has a total volume of @xmath119 .",
    "similarly , @xmath101 can be estimated as @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath121-function in energy simply removes one factor of energy from our equation . putting these expressions back into ( [ eq : partialwidth2 ] ) we find @xmath122 or , simplified @xmath123 where we used @xmath124 .",
    "if we now want to restore the @xmath125 factor , we notice that we must put one @xmath125 for each @xmath126 . in the end , the total rate is computed by adding the partial rates for each neutrino flavor , which is equivalent to multiply by 3 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath127 this width can be turned into a decay length as @xmath128    this makes clear we need to push the required energies above @xmath129 ( with @xmath130 ) for the rate to be appreciable . as a final remark , we notice that the decay length in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nudeclength ] ) strongly depends on both the energy and @xmath1",
    ". therefore , the error about its actual magnitude we might have made in our estimate will reflect in very small errors in the determination of the energy at which lv effects start to be relevant as well as of the constraint on @xmath1 .      at such high energies",

    "the magnitude of @xmath96 can be easily computed exploiting the kinematic equations .",

    "it is easy to construct a scenario where only one mass eigenstate decays - one eigenstate has a positive @xmath135 lv coefficient while the other two have no lv .",
    "while this is unnatural in some sense , it serves as a nice example to illuminate a method to easily hide lv .",
    "the neutrino spectrum produced by the gzk process has a distinct distribution in flavor states of 1/3 @xmath136 and 2/3 @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate a spectrum with lv we need to convert this flavor spectrum into a mass spectrum , i.e. we need to choose a neutrino mixing model . for our purposes",
    "we choose tribimaximal mixing  @xcite , which satisfies current experimental constraints and provides a simple mixing matrix .",
    "with tribimaximal mixing the gzk neutrino spectrum has equal distribution over all mass eigenstates .",
    "now that we have spelled out out test models we shall proceed discussing the results for both scenarios .",
    "the net effect of neutrino splitting is very simple .",
    "it kills one neutrino of energy @xmath138 and creates 3 neutrinos of average energy @xmath139 , provided the parent neutrino is above threshold and has a reasonable life time . as we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : computation ] , for a life time shorter than the age of the universe , the neutrino energy has to be above @xmath129 , i.e.  we need to probe uhe neutrinos .",
    "the effects of neutrino splitting on the uhe neutrino spectrum are twofold and can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "flux suppression at uh energies : :    the splitting is effectively an energy loss process for uhe neutrinos .",
    "if the rate is sufficiently high , the energy loss length can be below    1 mpc .",
    "let us call @xmath140 the energy at which    this happens . then , being gzk neutrinos produced mainly at distances    larger than 1 mpc , we do not expect any neutrino to be detected at    earth with @xmath141",
    ".    +    the mere observation of neutrinos up to a certain energy    @xmath142 would imply a constraint , according to    eq .",
    "[ eq : nudeclength ] @xmath143 flux enhancement at sub - uh energies : :    neutrinos lose energy by producing lower energy neutrinos .",
    "eventually    these neutrinos will become stable , either because their energy is    below threshold , or because their lifetime is larger than their    propagation time .",
    "accordingly , we expect an enhancement of the    neutrino flux at energies below    @xmath144 .    in spite of being qualitatively straightforward ,",
    "however , this analysis is not powerful enough to provide us with constraints on lv . in order to obtain meaningful constraints",
    ", we have to resort to full montecarlo simulations of the uhecr propagation from sources to the earth .",
    "we simulated then the propagation of uhecr protons in the inter galactic medium using the monte carlo package crpropa  @xcite , suitably modified to take into account lv in the neutrino sector .",
    "the simulation parameters are the following : we simulated unidimensional uhecr proton propagation , with source energy spectrum @xmath145 , from a spatially uniform distribution of sources located at redshift @xmath146 according to the waxman & bahcall ( wb ) distribution used in @xcite .",
    "the injection proton spectrum was tuned to fit auger data @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra_eta ] shows the outcome of the simulations for different values of the lv parameter @xmath125 in the best case scenario , together with experimental sensitivities from some existing and planned observatories , as well as the waxman & bahcall bound @xcite for reference .-",
    "rays , in the hypothesis that the sources are optically thin to the escape of uhe particles and that both @xmath147-rays and neutrinos are originated from uhecr interactions with radiation backgrounds .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this bound might be strongly affected by qg effects , as shown in @xcite . ]",
    "results are in agreement with qualitative expectations previously discussed : above a certain energy the neutrino spectrum displays a sharp cut off , while at lower energy a peak appears .",
    "the peak position and strength , as well as the position of the cut off , depend on the value of the lv parameter @xmath125 . if @xmath130 the peak is found at @xmath148 and overwhelms the li spectrum by a factor of roughly 10 , while the cut off energy is at @xmath149 .",
    "also the evolution of the neutrino spectra with @xmath125 can be seen in the same fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_eta ] .",
    "although at present it is not possible to draw firm conclusions for the constraints on lv in the neutrino sector , we notice that future experiments , if not already auger , will be able to probe the fluxes we predict , hence they will be able to cast constraints on @xmath125 . in the future , the arianna experiment @xcite will be able to probe fluxes down to @xmath150 in the energy range @xmath151 in the full configuration @xcite .",
    "if such a sensitivity will be achieved , a constraint of order @xmath5 will be cast , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_eta ] .",
    "moreover , the iceray experiment @xcite planned at the south pole is expected to observe roughly 4 neutrino events per year of data taking for the wb model preferentially studied here , in the range @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "hence , constraints of order @xmath153 are expected after few years of data taking by this experiment .",
    "we finally notice here that by exploiting this strategy nothing can be said about the case @xmath154 .",
    "if only one mass eigenstate decays , the energy momentum conservation equations , rates , and lifetimes all remain the same .",
    "we therefore can apply our montecarlo spectrum for this scenario to just any one of the mass eigenstates ( given our assumption of tribimaximal mixing no neutrino mass eigenstate is preferred ) .",
    "the only difference is that only 1/3 of the total flux undergoes neutrino splitting . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : onemasssplits ] . note that even for @xmath155 the departure from the li spectrum is significantly reduced , as one would expect , with the magnitude of the deviation at the peak being lowered to a @xmath156 excess over the li flux .",
    "hence , with present sensitivity , absence of a signal in the neutrino spectrum does not mean that lv is ruled out for neutrinos , even for @xmath2 positive coefficients .",
    "we notice that the cutoff feature present in the flavor blind case has now effectively disappeared .",
    "then , observations of a uhe neutrino flux up to some maximal energy do not allow to draw conclusions about lv in this case scenario .",
    "we now return to the question of negative coefficients and neutrino splitting .",
    "so far , in both our flavor blind and flavor dependent scenarios all the coefficients have been positive . as argued in section  [ sec : nusplitting ] , neutrinos can split even with negative coefficients when the relation @xmath76 holds .",
    "however , one can immediately see that therefore at least one of the mass eigenstates is always stable if the coefficients are negative .",
    "this implies that no equivalent of the  best case scenario \" ( all the mass eigenstates decay ) is possible for negative @xmath43 and that , consequently , the deviation from the li spectrum will be suppressed by at least 1/3 .",
    "therefore cosmogenic neutrinos are not effective probes of the @xmath157 region of parameter space .",
    "predictions of cosmogenic neutrino spectra are known to be plagued by several uncertainties , as they depend strongly on the evolution of uhecr sources with redshift , which can not be directly probed with uhecrs due to the gzk attenuation effect . as a consequence , also",
    "our predictions for the uhe neutrino flux in the presence of lv can be affected .",
    "we check this by simulating different uhecr sources evolution models for the  best case scenario \" . in fig .",
    "[ fig : max ] we show the results for the model outlined in @xcite , which is expected to give the largest flux .    as a result , the presence and the strength of the bump feature are demonstrated to be weakly dependent on the underlying uhecr source distribution , with the choice of the source distribution affecting by a factor of 2 the height of the bump .",
    "this was somewhat expected from our qualitative considerations : as long as uhecr sources are located at distances much larger than 1 mpc from earth , the magnitude of the bump depends only on how many neutrinos were originally produced at energy larger than the lv cutoff energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the cutoff feature is definitely model independent , as long as the unknown maximal energy at which uhecrs are accelerated is enough to produce neutrinos at energy larger than @xmath158 .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous sections , there are other processes , besides splitting , leading to neutrinos losing energy in the inter - galactic medium . in particular",
    ", the hadronic decay modes of the z@xmath159 could lead to the production of uhe protons , thereby mimicking a `` z - burst '' effect @xcite .",
    "although this model was conceived for other purposes than constraining lv , and has now lost most of its attraction due to experimental results on proton spectra above the gzk threshold , it is notable that the same mechanism could in principle help constrain lv in the neutrino sector . however , we can argue with a very simple argument that this is not the case .",
    "let us consider the li neutrino flux , which corresponds in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_eta ] to the @xmath160 case .",
    "the minimal process leading to proton production in this context is @xmath161 , whose threshold energy , if @xmath130 , is at @xmath162 . processes involving more particles are naturally suppressed , however they represent the majority of the allowed channels and hence they might be relevant to our case . even if we do not know the energy spectrum of the produced protons , we know that their mean energy is roughly 1/80 times the energy of the parent neutrino @xcite .",
    "we can then compute the maximal expected flux of uhecrs produced by this z - burst - like mechanism by converting all the neutrinos with energy @xmath163 above threshold into 2 protons of energy @xmath164 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zburst ] .",
    "this mechanism would indeed contribute to the uhecr spectrum at @xmath165 , producing an excess no larger than 5% , which however is below the systematic uncertainties of uhecr experiments .",
    "therefore , no constraints on lv can be implied using this technique .",
    "electron / positron pair production would also contribute to the cutoff in the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the threshold for pair production of electrons is at roughly @xmath166 ev . at energies near the existing neutrino splitting cutoff , @xmath167",
    "ev we are well above threshold .",
    "the mass of the electrons is therefore irrelevant in calculating the decay rate ( just as the neutrino mass was ) and hence the electron pair production process has nearly the same rate as the neutrino splitting process .",
    "if neutrinos produce electron / positron pairs ( which after all depends on lv in the electron sector ) it can only increase the steepness of the cutoff .",
    "it will not contribute to the excess neutrino flux at @xmath168 ev and hence one needs to probe energies one order of magnitude larger than @xmath169 to derive constraints exploiting the presence or the absence of a cutoff feature .",
    "in this work we have investigated possible signals of higher dimension lv cpt even operators in the uhe neutrino spectrum , in particular the effect of the neutrino splitting on the uhe neutrino spectrum . this process provides a clean test as it does not involve other lv operators apart from the neutrinos ones .",
    "in addition , since the dominant neutrino field is left - handed , there are no complications due to different lv for different chirality of fermion , as there are in the uhecr case , and one ends up with one lv coefficient for each neutrino mass eigenstate . in the flavor blind scenario , where every mass eigenstate undergoes splitting approximately at the same energy , there is both a precocious fall off of the neutrino flux at uhe as well as a significant excess in the uhe neutrino flux at energies as low as @xmath168 ev",
    ". noticeably , this kind of energies are well within reach of current and future uhecr experiments and about order of magnitude below those so far used for lv tests with hadronic and electromagnetic uhecrs .",
    "according to our study , existing or planned uhe neutrino experiments have the potential to probe lv in the neutrino sector for coefficients @xmath170 .",
    "however , we have discovered a serious difficulty with deriving constraints in the absence of a positive lv signal event .",
    "the distribution in mass eigenstates is roughly equal for uhe neutrinos in realistic mixing scenarios .",
    "although it might seem somewhat unnatural that lv has different effects on different mass states of the same particle field , if this is the case then it is possible that lv can exist / be strong for one mass eigenstate yet be almost invisible for uhe neutrino detectors .",
    "in particular , the observation of a neutrino flux up to some maximal energy does not imply a firm conclusion on lv , at least with present accuracy . however , let us note that if a neutrino is ever detected at energy @xmath163 , we can rule out a flavor blind @xmath171 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint_naive ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the bump feature can lead to constraints on @xmath172 , as this bump should be observable in any such scenario of lv in the neutrino sector . in this case , to obtain a @xmath2 constraint on lv requires at least a 50% accuracy in the determination of the neutrino spectrum in the energy range @xmath173 , which can be achieved by future experiments .",
