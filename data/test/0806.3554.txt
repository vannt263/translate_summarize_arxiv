    "in hadron physics , the inter - quark interaction is one of the fundamental and essential properties . in particular ,",
    "the quark confinement is not only an important property of hadrons but also an important problem of the modern physics .",
    "the non - abelian and strong coupling nature of qcd makes it difficult to treat the inter - quark interaction and many other nonperturbative phenomena analytically .",
    "lattice qcd is the first - principle calculation based on the qcd lagrangian , and is one of the most useful approaches for such nonperturbative phenomena @xcite .    the quark confinement in hadrons is well described by the picture of the gluonic  flux tube \" or  string \" @xcite .",
    "this means that the confinement potential is a linear function of the flux - tube length .",
    "for example , the quark - antiquark ( @xmath7 ) potential is written as the one - gluon - exchange coulomb potential plus the linear confinement potential , @xmath8 which is called the cornell potential @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 is the distance between the quark and the antiquark , and it is equal to the gluonic flux - tube length of the @xmath7 system .",
    "lattice qcd also reproduces this functional form of the @xmath7 potential @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lattice qcd calculations reveal that this picture holds in three - quark ( @xmath9 ) systems and multi - quark systems .",
    "the @xmath9 potential is obtained from quenched lattice qcd as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the coordinates of three quarks and @xmath12 is the flux - tube length @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 flux tube has the geometry minimally connecting the three quarks , and forms the y - type structure @xcite .",
    "the similar potentials are obtained in multi - quark systems @xcite . in the flux - tube picture of @xmath9 and multi - quark systems ,",
    "the confining force is a many - body force , reflecting the complicated gluonic dynamics based on the su(3 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the strength of the confinement by these flux tubes , i.e. , the string tension , is the universal value in hadrons , about 0.89 gev / fm .",
    "these inter - quark interactions are mainly constructed from the gluon dynamics . in particular , as most of previous lattice works , the static and quenched calculation strictly gives only the gluonic potential . however , since not only gluons but also quarks exist in hadrons , the realistic inter - quark potential would include quark effects .",
    "the quark effects can be categorized into two types .",
    "one is the unquenched effect , or the sea quark effect .",
    "as already known , the sea quark causes ",
    "string breaking \" and flattens the potential slope in long range .",
    "this phenomenon is convinced also in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the other is the finite - mass valence quark effect .",
    "an example of this effect is the relativistic correction to the coulomb interaction , i.e. , the fermi - breit interaction @xcite . as well as the coulomb potential",
    ", we can also expect the finite - mass quark effects on the confinement potential . in 3q or multi - quark systems",
    ", there would exist nontrivial effects reflecting the characteristic flux - tube structure . in this paper , we investigate this  motional \" effect of finite - mass valence quarks .        to investigate such quark motional effects , we define the heavy - heavy - light quark ( @xmath0 ) potential @xcite .",
    "consider the @xmath0 system which is constructed with two static quarks and one finite - mass quark .",
    "the @xmath0 potential @xmath13 is defined as the energy of the @xmath0 system in terms of the inter - heavy - quark distance @xmath4 .",
    "it is the inter - two - quark potential in baryons which effectively includes the light - quark effects .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 potential in lattice qcd , and study the nontrivial light - quark effect by comparing it with the static @xmath7 or @xmath9 potential .    as an example of experimental @xmath0 baryons ,",
    "the doubly charmed baryon is recently observed by the selex collaboration at fermilab . in 2002",
    ", they observed the doubly charmed baryon @xmath14 through a decay process @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "they also confirmed another decay process @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however , there is also the negative result , for example , by the babar collaboration @xcite .",
    "the experimental discovery of the doubly charmed baryons is still under debate , and more experimental information is desired .",
    "the doubly charmed baryons are also theoretically investigated in lattice qcd @xcite and other approaches @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 potential in su(3 ) lattice qcd , and investigate the finite - mass valence quark effect in the inter - quark potential in baryons . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the potential calculation using the @xmath0 wilson loop . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the coulomb gauge fixing for the statistical error reduction , and consider its effect on the inter - quark potential . in sec .",
    "iv , we show the lattice qcd data and the resulting @xmath0 potential , and discuss the finite - mass valence quark effect on the @xmath0 potential .",
    "section v is devoted to the summary .",
    "as the basic potential calculations in lattice qcd , we define the @xmath0 wilson loop for the @xmath0 potential calculation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the @xmath0 wilson loop is constructed from two  staples \" of static - quark trajectories and one light - quark propagator .",
    "the two staples @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the path - ordered product of link variables , as the static inter - quark potential calculation .",
    "the major difference from the usual potential calculation is that the @xmath0 wilson loop includes the quark propagator @xmath19 , which represents the light quark moving around .",
    "they are written as @xmath20 where the subscripts @xmath21 are color indices .",
    "when @xmath22 is large enough , the expectation value of the @xmath0 wilson loop should depend only on the spatial size @xmath4 and the temporal size @xmath22 , not on the position of the source and sink junction points ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 potential is written with one parameter @xmath4 , which is the distance between the two heavy quarks .",
    "the @xmath0 potential is obtained from the expectation value of the @xmath0 wilson loop as @xmath25 the symbol @xmath26 means the expectation value integrated over the gauge field . in practical analysis ,",
    "the expectation value is fitted with a single exponential form @xmath27 in large but finite range of @xmath22 . to estimate the suitable fit range of @xmath22 ,",
    "the effective mass is defined as @xmath28 if the state is dominated by a single component of the potentials , the effective mass is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the plateau region of the effective mass is the indication to determine the fit range of @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate the expectation value in lattice qcd for several values of @xmath4 , and explore a suitable functional form of @xmath13 .    in eq .",
    "( [ wqqq ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the @xmath0 wilson loop is defined as a single gauge - invariant loop . for the reduction of the statistical error , we actually use the  wall - to - wall @xmath0 wilson loop \" .",
    "we define the wall - to - wall quark propagator as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the spatial sites of the source and sink respectively , and @xmath32 is the number of the spatial lattice sites .",
    "this wall - to - wall propagator is the averaged propagator from the whole space at one time to that at another time .",
    "( the  wall \" means the average over all spatial sites . )",
    "the wall - to - wall @xmath0 wilson loop is constructed by replacing the single quark propagator in the @xmath0 wilson loop with this wall - to - wall quark propagator .",
    "the schematic figure is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "because such a propagator is independent of the spatial position , we can easily sum up the parallel translated wall - to - wall @xmath0 wilson loops in the whole space .",
    "this summing up drastically suppresses the statistical error owing to the large statistics . without gauge fixing ,",
    "the disconnected components in the wall - to - wall @xmath0 wilson loops automatically vanish by elitzur s theorem and only the gauge - invariant components remain , and therefore the resulting @xmath0 potential is gauge invariant .",
    ".[tab2 ] the correspondence between @xmath33 and the meson masses .",
    "the list shows the used gauge configuration number @xmath34 , the pion mass @xmath35 , the @xmath36 meson mass @xmath37 , and the approximate constituent quark mass @xmath38 .",
    "the statistical error is estimated with the jackknife method . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculate the gauge - invariant @xmath0 potential in the large - quark - mass case @xmath39 with the large statistics @xmath40 . in the large - quark - mass case , compared to the small - quark - mass case , the statistical error is relatively small and the computing time for the quark propagator is fairly short . for further statistical improvement , the junction - average procedure explained in appendix a2 is adopted for the gauge - invariant calculation .",
    "nonetheless , the statistical error is still large , and its data can be taken only in the region of @xmath41 fm . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and table [ tab8 ] .",
    "note that the listed error in table [ tab8 ] is only the statistical error , and that the gauge - invariant calculation involves the systematic error from the fit - range dependence .",
    "the gauge - invariant result seems to be close to the coulomb gauge result , but the precise comparison is difficult by the large statistical and systematic error .    in the lighter quark case ,",
    "the statistical error is severely large and the potential can not be extracted at all .",
    "instead , we show the landau gauge result at @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and table [ tab8 ] .",
    "the result with the landau gauge is roughly coincident to that with the coulomb gauge , except the irrelevant constant shift .",
