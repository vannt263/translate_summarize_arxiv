    "massive clusters of galaxies are rare objects , forming from the high - sigma tail of the cosmological density distribution .",
    "their properties are powerful probes of cosmology , and give insight into the process of structure formation on large scales . for example , compared to z=0 , and in a @xmath8cdm universe , the number density of virialized halos of @xmath9x10@xmath10 is predicted to be a factor of @xmath410 lower at z=0.5 , or a factor of @xmath4100 lower at z=1 , from both simulations and the press - schechter approximation ( eg . bode 2001 ) .",
    "such a large change in number density implies that a significant fraction of the progenitor systems at high redshift should be unvirialized , perhaps containing lower mass systems in the process of merging .",
    "the number of genuinely massive clusters known at high redshifts is very small , and the number of relaxed high redshift massive clusters is even smaller .",
    "thus the fraction which are relaxed , giving direct information on the epoch and mode of assembly of massive clusters , is poorly known .",
    "relaxed , massive clusters at high redshifts also offer the best opportunities for deriving total masses and gas mass fractions from the x - ray data without too many uncertainties due to hydrostatic equilibrium assumptions , and also with reasonable signal - to - noise .",
    "the clusters were discovered in a @xmath7 serendipitous x - ray survey ( warps - scharf 1997 , jones 1998 , perlman 2002 ) .",
    "of 16 clusters at z@xmath00.6 which form a complete , x - ray selected sample , 10 have been observed with @xmath15 and/or @xmath2 . for 3 of these ,",
    "the @xmath15 observations were of low quality due to periods of high background .",
    "the remaining observations , however , represent a major step forward compared to previous results from @xmath7 ( see also rosati , these proceedings and references therein ) .",
    "standard analysis techniques were applied to the @xmath15 and @xmath2 data , taking into account the acis contamination affecting the low energy efficiency , and using a local background subtraction method to obtain spectra .",
    "images were exposure corrected and adaptively smoothed so that all features are significant at the 99% confidence level .    in general a single temperature was measured ( but see clj1226.9 + 3332 below for a temperature profile ) .",
    "two - dimensional @xmath16-profiles were fit to the images , including psf blurring , to obtain values for the core radii and @xmath16 .",
    "for the clusters which appeared relaxed , and assuming spherical symmetry , the gas mass was derived from an integral of the density profile given by the @xmath16-profile .",
    "the total gravitating mass was derived by additionally assuming isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the total mass within a radius @xmath17 is then given by      to measure the virial radius , we used eqn ( 1.1 ) to find the radius within which the total overdensity was 200 times the critical density at the redshift of each cluster .",
    "the quoted fluxes , luminosities and masses were measured via an extrapolation from the typical detection radius of @xmath190.3 - 0.45 @xmath20 to the virial radius .        the discovery of clj1226.9 + 3332 is described by ebeling ( 2001 ) . the @xmath15 image of clj1226.9 + 3332",
    "is shown in fig [ f12 ] , overlaid on a deep i band image .",
    "the x - ray morphology appears generally relaxed , in contrast to cluster ms1054 - 0321 , the other high temperature cluster known at z@xmath00.8 ( jeltema 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath15 temperature of 11.5@xmath3 kev is consistent with the velocity dispersion of @xmath41100 km s@xmath14 , based on 15 galaxy redshifts .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity is 5.4x10@xmath21 erg s@xmath14 .",
    "we derive a mass of ( 1.4@xmath50.2)x10@xmath6 within the virial radius .",
    "our analysis of a short @xmath2 observation confirms the lack of significant point - source contamination , and the temperature and luminosity , albeit with lower precision ( see also cagnoni 2001 ) .    a temperature profile ( fig [ f12 ] ) is consistent with the cluster being isothermal out to 45% of the virial radius",
    ". the metal abundance of @xmath22=0.33@xmath23 and gas mass fraction of 8.6@xmath24% are consistent with those of local clusters of the same temperature ( see below ) .",

    "we show that our measurements , and those of others , of cluster metallicities up to z=0.9 are consistent with the canonical value of 0.3 times the solar value found at lower redshifts by mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) .",
    "the gas mass fractions we measure , within a radius of 0.3@xmath20 ( where they are the most reliable ) are consistent with those found by sanderson ( 2002 ) for local clusters of the same temperature . thus the gas , and the metals it contains , were in place by z@xmath40.8 in at least some massive clusters .          in fig [ f12a ]",

    "the lower ( red ) dashed line shows the expected change in normalisation assuming clusters observed at z=0.8 were formed at z=0.8 , using the relation @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the high redshift clusters except the most massive one are consistent with the low redshift relation , rather than the z=0.8 prediction .",
    "it is however the most massive cluster ( clj1226 ) which has evidence of isothermality and the most reliable mass .",
    "the masses of the other high redshift clusters would need to be reduced by @xmath440% in order to be consistent with the z=0.8 prediction .",
    "sanderson have shown that an incorrect assumption of isothermality when clusters are not isothermal produces , on average , masses which are too high by 30% at @xmath27 .",
    "this would explain most of the offset we find .",
    "further work is in progress , and will be reported in future papers , but more accurate masses at high redshifts , based on temperature profiles , may be required before firm conclusions can be reached .",
    "the @xmath7 detections were obtained at @xmath7 off - axis angles of up to 15 arcmin , where the psf degrades to @xmath450 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "thus some point - source contamination is expected in all the @xmath7 cluster surveys .",
    "the degree of contamination depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection and the algorithm used for source detection and characterisation .",
    "based on a preliminary analysis , 2 or 3 out of 9 clusters at z@xmath00.6 in the warps survey were artificially boosted above the survey flux limit by significant point source contamination . removing these sources from the sample , and using the updated @xmath15 and @xmath2 fluxes , we recomputed the x - ray luminosity function at 0.6@xmath301.1 .",
    "the resultant shifts to lower space densities were within the poissonian error bars , suggesting that point source contamination can be an important effect for individual @xmath7 measurements , but the previous broad conclusions regarding cluster evolution are unaffected .",
