    "disordered systems of interacting localized particles have been extensively studied for over two decades .",
    "a characteristic feature of these systems is a complex many valley structure of the energy landscape of the state space @xcite .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently low temperatures , the system can not be considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium : gibbs ensemble theory of statistical mechanics , which is based on the equivalence of time and ensemble averages , is not applicable . thus non - ergodic effects are important .",
    "the coulomb glass @xcite is a prominent example of such disordered systems . in heavily doped crystalline semiconductors , amorphous semiconductor - metal alloys , and granular metals",
    ", it plays an important role as a semiclassical model for systems of localized states .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the coulomb glass has been studied by several groups : schreiber et al.@xcite , as well as prez - garrido et al .",
    "@xcite determined numerically the transition probabilities between low - energy many - particle states , and studied the eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix .",
    "the former group directly diagonalized this matrix , whereas the latter developed a renormalization method to eliminate the transitions with large rates , what considerably simplifies the diagonalization .",
    "a broad distribution of relaxation times over several orders of magnitude was found in both cases .",
    "it reflects the glassy behavior of this system . moreover , wappler et al .",
    "@xcite used the damage - spreading algorithm to study the temporal evolution of the system , and found evidence for a dynamical phase transition .",
    "yu studied the time development of the coulomb gap considering a self - consistent equation for the density of states @xcite .",
    "she too observed that very long time scales are involved .",
    "the main aim of this work is to study numerically non - ergodic effects in the coulomb glass analyzing the transitions between many - particle states .",
    "we apply this procedure to the investigation of such effects in the specific heat .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the coulomb - glass model .",
    "section iii describes how the low - energy many - particle states are obtained numerically . in sec.iv",
    ", we calculate the transition probabilities between these states , and map the dynamical behavior of the coulomb - glass sample to a graph .",
    "the nodes of the graph represent the many - particle states , and the edges the relevant transitions between them . analyzing the structure of this graph",
    ", we determine the value of a physical observable in dependence on the duration of its measurement . in sec .",
    "v , we use this method for the investigation of the non - ergodic effects in the specific heat : we study the influence of temperature , duration of measurement , disorder , and dimensionality . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we extract some conclusions .",
    "the classical impurity band ( cib ) model is the most realistic model for simulating an impurity band of localized states in a lightly doped semiconductor when quantum interference can be neglected @xcite .",
    "it is applicable if the following two conditions are fulfilled : ( i ) the mean nearest - neighbor distance is considerably larger than the localization radius of the wavefunction of an isolated impurity state .",
    "( ii ) the temperature is so low that both the activation to the conduction band / from the valence band , and the formation of doubly charged donors / acceptors can be neglected .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional sample of an n - type , partially compensated semiconductor with donor concentration @xmath1 , and acceptor concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the degree of compensation @xmath3 can range from 0 to 1 .",
    "so donors are either occupied , that means neutral , or empty , that means positively charged .",
    "acceptors captured an electron each , and are negatively charged .",
    "the distribution of electrons between the donors is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath4 the donor occupation number @xmath5 equals 1 for occupied donors , and 0 for ionized donors .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where the random positions of the donors are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and those of the acceptors by @xmath10 .",
    "however , to minimize size effects , we impose periodic boundary conditions and use the minimum image convention @xcite .",
    "that means , in computing @xmath11 , we substitute the projection of @xmath11 onto each of the coordinate axis , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , by the smallest related value in a periodically repeated representation , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the edge size of the sample . for numerical reasons , we construct the samples so that the nearest neighbor distance exceeds 0.5 , a well justified approximation for amorphous semiconductors , but not for crystalline systems . in this work , the unit of distance",
    "is defined by the donor density @xmath16 , and electron charge , dielectric constant , and boltzmann constant are taken to be unity .    within the present study ,",
    "most of the calculations are performed for a simplified version of this model . following refs .",
    ", see also , we consider a partially filled band of elementary charges ( particles ) localized on a regular lattice formed by the @xmath1 donor sites . here , the acceptors are substituted by background charges @xmath17 at each of the lattice sites , guaranteeing electro - neutrality on average .",
    "the disorder is simulated by a random potential @xmath18 .",
    "its values are uniformly distributed between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the influence of the randomness of the donor positions is ignored , as well as the correlations between the values of the acceptor potential at neighboring donor sites . moreover ,",
    "the rectangular distribution of the @xmath18 is a simplification neglecting contributions from particular close pairs of donors and acceptors .",
    "this model is represented by the hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes again the occupation number of site @xmath23 .",
    "as above , @xmath24 is the distance between sites @xmath23 and @xmath25 according to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lattice spacing is taken as unit of distance .",
    "a mixed form of both the models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is obtained in the following way : the sites are positioned at random , and the acceptor potential is substituted by a random on - site potential plus the potential of neutralizing charges @xmath17 at each site @xcite .",
    "this mixed form is more realistic than eq .",
    "( 2 ) : it keeps the donor disorder as the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , but simplifies the disorder contribution from the acceptors . by means of @xmath18",
    ", the influence of the random surroundings of host atoms in an amorphous semiconductor can be simulated .",
    "this model is in the following referred to as random - position - with - random - potential model .",
    "the relaxation procedures , which we use , alternatively simulate the sample to be isolated , or to be in contact with a particle reservoir @xcite .",
    "the latter means that , instead of @xmath26 , the grand canonical potential , @xmath27 , is minimized .",
    "the value of the chemical potential @xmath28 depends on @xmath3 , i.e. , it is fixed by the electro - neutrality condition . here ,",
    "we first obtain @xmath28 performing a canonical simulation with reduced accuracy .",
    "then we calculate the set of low - energy states , as described below , taking into account particle exchange with the reservoir .",
    "for studying low - temperature properties treating correlations exactly , we need to know a set @xmath29 of almost all many - particles states in a certain energy interval above the ground state energy .",
    "if the occupation numbers are known , the energy of a state can easily and directly be determined from eq .",
    "( 1 ) because we are treating a classical system .",
    "the problems , however , consist in the binomially large number of possible configurations , and in the existence of many local minima .",
    "thus it is a complicated task to obtain such a set of low - energy many - particle states .",
    "it has been approached by several methods : mochena and pollak @xcite developed an approximative renormalization - like procedure .",
    "schreiber and tenelsen @xcite used the metropolis algorithm to collect low - lying states which seems to be favorable in comparison to the previous method @xcite .",
    "mbius and pollak @xcite , and prez - garrido et al .",
    "@xcite used two - stage algorithms . in the first stage , they obtained sets of local minima by means of relaxation .",
    "for that , a complete search considering rearrangements of the site occupations including up to four sites , and an incomplete search concerning more complex rearrangements , built up of several low - energy one - electron hops ( shifts ) , were performed in refs .   and , respectively . in the second stage",
    ", both groups completed the table of low - energy states by systematically investigating the neighborhood ( in the configuration space ) of each of these states .",
    "this neighborhood is defined via the accessibility within only one of the considered rearrangements .    here",
    ", we find the set @xmath29 of @xmath30 low - energy many - particle states by means of a three - stage algorithm ; for a short preliminary description see ref .  .",
    "in the first two stages , we create , and improve a `` backbone '' of @xmath29 , formed by metastable states , the number of which can be considerably smaller than @xmath30 . then , in the third stage , we complete @xmath29 by systematically investigating the neighborhood of the states found . our procedure , which includes sophisticated local search @xcite , and thermal cycling @xcite , is explained in detail in the following .    in the first stage , creating the backbone of @xmath29 , we repeatedly start from states chosen at random , and simulate quenching the sample ( i.e. , a rapid relaxation ) by means of a local search procedure : in an iterative process , we search the neighborhood of the actual state for states of lower energy , and accept always the first such state found .",
    "the process stops when no lower neighboring state exists .",
    "our local search algorithm @xcite ensures stability with respect to rearrangements concerning one up to four sites . making use of the branch - and - bound idea in order to avoid unnecessary attempts to a large extent",
    ", it considers the following rearrangements :    * transition of one electron between the sample and a reservoir , * arbitrary one - electron hops within the sample , * rearrangements by performing simultaneously an ( a ) and a ( b ) transition , and * arbitrary two - electron hops within the sample .    to ensure high efficiency of the simulations , the searches in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) have to be restricted to a certain number of neighbors . for one- ,",
    "two- , and three - dimensional systems , we consider the first 4 , 8 , and 26 neighbors , respectively .",
    "( though the number of possible rearrangements increases rapidly with the number of neighbors considered , the portion of long - range hops among the energy decreasing rearrangements is small due to the decreasing interaction strength . )    the second stage consists in extending , and improving this set of metastable states by thermal cycling @xcite .",
    "for that , a further set @xmath31 of metastable states is considered .",
    "initially , it equals a subset of @xmath29 , containing the states of lowest energy .",
    "we cyclically choose one of the states from @xmath31 , and apply to it a metropolis process with a certain temperature .",
    "this process , which is referred to as heating , is terminated , however , after a small number of successful steps .",
    "thus a great part of the information on the ground state , gained within the previous cycles , is retained .",
    "then we quench the sample by means of the above local search algorithm .",
    "if the energy of the final state is lower than the energy of the initial state , the latter is substituted in @xmath31 .",
    "for each of the final states of these cycles , we check whether or not it is already contained in @xmath29 . if not , and",
    "if , moreover , the total number of states is smaller than its maximum value , we add it to @xmath29 . however , if the final state is not contained within @xmath29 , but @xmath29 has been already `` filled '' , we substitute the final state for the state in @xmath29 of highest energy , provided the energy of the final state is lower than the energy of the latter .",
    "several details of thermal cycling should be mentioned : when starting , the temperature of the metropolis process is chosen to be equal to the total energy gain in quenching a random state divided by the number of sites .",
    "in the course of the thermal cycling procedure , this temperature is reduced gradually .",
    "the cyclic procedure continues until its efficiency becomes so low that , within a `` reasonable '' number of cycles , the set @xmath31 has not been improved further . in the heating",
    ", we consider only two kinds of rearrangements , namely ( a ) and ( b ) . for @xmath32 , 2 , and 3 , the latter",
    "are restricted to the first 4 , 8 , and 26 neighbors , respectively . during this process",
    ", we fix the occupation of those sites which have the same @xmath5 value in all states contained in @xmath33 because these values obviously favor a low energy .",
    "moreover , in order to diminish the portion of unsuccessful attempts in the metropolis process , we further reduce the set of rearrangements considered : we tabulate the relevant rearrangements after each temperature change , as well as after adding a new state to @xmath31 .",
    "as relevance criterion , we use the condition that , for at least one of the states in @xmath33 , the related energy change must be smaller than the temperature . in heating , we consider only the excitations stored in this table .",
    "each heating is terminated after having performed 50 rearrangements .    in the third stage , we complete the set @xmath29 of low - energy states by systematically investigating the neighborhood ( in the configuration space ) of the states found @xcite : for each state in @xmath29 , we construct all neighboring states , considering the same types of rearrangements as above .",
    "however , we perform ( c ) and ( d ) searches ( restricted also here to the first 4 , 8 , and 26 neighboring sites if @xmath32 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ) only for those states , which are local minima with respect to the ( a ) and ( b ) rearrangements . each new state is added to @xmath29 if the number of states in @xmath29 is smaller than its maximum value . otherwise , we substitute the highest - energy state in @xmath29 provided the energy of the new state is lower .",
    "this completion procedure starts with the state which has the highest energy , and proceeds cyclically until all states contained in @xmath29 have been investigated .",
    "if the number of states in @xmath29 is large , the decision whether or not the current state has been added to @xmath29 already previously , is particularly cpu time consuming . this decision is significantly accelerated by searching hierarchically in an array ordered according to the energies , where pointer arithmetics is used .    to check our program",
    ", we performed a series of tests .",
    "the degree of completeness of the spectrum of many - particle states within a certain energy interval above the ground state energy was judged in a similar way as in ref .  .",
    "we observed that the completeness and the cpu time required do not only depend on the number @xmath30 of states included in @xmath29 , and on the number of local searches performed in the first stage , but to a considerable extent also on the number of states in @xmath31 . in the numerical experiments described in sec .",
    "v , @xmath30 has values between @xmath34 and @xmath35 what ensures that the width of the related energy interval exceeds the temperature by at least a factor of 25 .",
    "we found that it is a good choice to adjust the number of local searches in the first stage to @xmath36 , and the number of states in @xmath31 to @xmath37 .",
    "naturally , the kinds of rearrangements considered in the three stages are very important too .",
    "we devoted special attention to testing the thermal cycling part , which improves the backbone of @xmath29 .",
    "its efficiency in finding states of particularly low energy is illustrated by fig .  1 .",
    "this graph presents the mean energy of the lowest state found in dependence on the cpu time required , contrasting results for simulated annealing ( same rearrangements as in heating ) , sophisticated multi - start local search ( repeatedly quenching states chosen at random by means of rearrangements ( a ) - ( d ) ) , and thermal cycling .",
    "1 shows that , in searching for states of very low energy , thermal cycling is not only far superior to simulated annealing , but also to the sophisticated multi - start local search algorithm .",
    "thus the incorporation of thermal cycling leads to a considerable efficiency increase in the construction of sets of low - energy many - particle states .    as a check of our numerical approach to obtaining almost complete sets of low - energy many - particle states",
    ", we verified that the corresponding results for the equilibrium specific heat agree with refs .   .",
    "our main aim is to study the influence of the duration @xmath38 of the measurement , during which the state of the sample travels randomly through its configuration space , on the expectation value of an observable @xmath39 .",
    "for that , we decompose the configuration space into separate regions , isolated from each other on the time scale @xmath38 , in other words , into clusters of states .",
    "two approximations are basic for this approach : ( i ) the duration of measurement is long enough for establishing thermal equilibrium inside each cluster .",
    "( ii ) transitions between different clusters are so rare that they can be ignored on the time scale of the measurement .",
    "first , we calculate the transition probability per unit time from the many - particle state @xmath40 to the state @xmath41 . according to ref .   , it is given by @xmath42 & { \\rm if}\\ e_i < e_j \\\\   1 & { \\rm if}\\ e_i > e_j\\ , \\end{array } \\right . \\,.\\ ] ] in this equation , the parameter @xmath43 is a constant of the order of the phonon frequency , @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 denotes the localization radius , and @xmath46 the energy of the state @xmath40 .",
    "the sum term is an abbreviation of the minimized sum of the related hopping lengths ; it concerns only those sites , the occupation of which is changed in the transition .",
    "that means , we decompose the many - electron transition into independent one - electron hops . among all possible such decompositions",
    ", we choose that for which the sum of the lengths of the one - electron hops takes its minimum value .    presuming the occupation probabilities of the states to have their thermodynamic equilibrium values",
    ", we obtain the rate of transitions from state @xmath40 to state @xmath41 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the partition function . in thermodynamic equilibrium , @xmath49 .",
    "thus the transition time , i.e. , the inverse of the equilibrium transition rate , is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "now , we map the dynamics of the coulomb glass sample simulated to a graph , where the nodes represent the states , and the edges those transitions between them for which @xmath53 .",
    "the nodes which are directly or indirectly connected with each other by such edges form clusters . these cluster correspond to regions of the configuration space being isolated from each other on the time scale @xmath38 . here",
    "we presume equilibrium in determining @xmath54 .",
    "however , this principle can easily be generalized to the non - equilibrium case , see below .",
    "provided , at the beginning of the measuring process , the sample is in one of the states of the cluster @xmath55 , we measure as value of the observable @xmath39 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the value of @xmath39 for the state @xmath40 , and @xmath58 the partition function of this cluster .",
    "the values of @xmath59 can have a very broad distribution .",
    "finally , we turn to the expectation value of @xmath39 , that is the mean value of repeated measurements , referred to in the following as @xmath60 .",
    "the probability to find the sample in one of the states belonging to the cluster @xmath55 be @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is given by the weighted average of the @xmath63 : @xmath64 in consequence , @xmath62 depends via the cluster structure and @xmath61 on @xmath38 , and also on @xmath65 .",
    "both the cluster structure and @xmath61 are influenced by the history of the sample . in our numerical experiments , we have simulated two situations :    * as standard case , we presume that the sample has reached thermal equilibrium before the measurements ; thus @xmath66 . * alternatively , we assume the sample to have been quenched from infinite @xmath65 to the measuring @xmath65 within a short time interval @xmath67 . to emulate this process",
    "we quench first to @xmath68 , and heat then immediately to the measuring @xmath65 : in the beginning , we assign the same probability to all states , @xmath69 .",
    "then , we perform the following iteration treating the states according to decreasing energy .",
    "we re - distribute the weight of the considered state to all those states of lower energy to which a transition can happen within @xmath67 modifying the set of the @xmath70 correspondingly .",
    "the related transition times are obtained in a way analogous to the derivation of eq .",
    "( 5 ) . that means , substituting the equilibrium occupation probabilities by the ( iteration cycle dependent ) non - equilibrium @xmath70 , we get for the transition @xmath71 @xmath72 thus the quenching process",
    "is related to the modification of parts of the states graph ( differing from the `` equilibrium graph '' ) in each of the iteration steps . at the end of the iteration ,",
    "only the local minima have a finite occupation probability .",
    "finally , we assign to each `` equilibrium cluster '' the sum of the occupation probabilities of the included `` non - equilibrium local minima '' . in this way",
    ", we calculate the non - equilibrium values of @xmath61 , but we neglect the influence of the preparation mode on @xmath54 , and thus on the structure of the clusters which are isolated from each other on the time scale @xmath38 .",
    "applying the methods presented in secs .",
    "iii and iv to the study of non - ergodic effects in the specific heat , we start from the definition of this observable for a cluster @xmath55 of states , which is in thermal equilibrium : @xmath73 since the specific heat is by itself a quantity relating to an ensemble of states rather than to a single state , we do not need brackets here to mark the averaging over the states in the cluster @xmath55 , in deviation from the general notation @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . after averaging over the set of clusters ,",
    "the @xmath38 dependent value of the specific heat @xmath75 is obtained utilizing eq .",
    "( 7 ) .    to make the influence of @xmath38 directly visible",
    ", we consider the quotient of the values of the specific heat for finite and infinite duration of measurement , respectively : @xmath76 this quantity is in the following referred to as non - ergodicity quotient .",
    "studying @xmath77 rather than @xmath75 is additionally motivated by numerical reasons : the random fluctuations of @xmath78 from sample to sample are considerably smaller than the fluctuations of @xmath79 . moreover , in order to characterize the fluctuations of @xmath80 from measurement to measurement , we consider its root - mean - square deviation , related to the distribution of the clusters , @xmath81    investigating the physical properties of macroscopic systems , we have calculated ensemble averages , and have compared the results for different sample sizes .",
    "the number of samples to be taken into account depends not only on the accuracy to be achieved , but also on all the various details of the simulated situation .",
    "generally , we have chosen the size of the samples so large that corresponding convergence of the results is ensured .",
    "the related parameter values are given in the figure captions .",
    "several details of our simulations have to be mentioned : the localization radius @xmath45 equals always 0.2 @xcite . decreasing its value corresponds , crudely speaking , to stretching the time scale , and thus enhances the non - ergodic effects . since a great part of the literature concerns the simplified coulomb glass model according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( sites arranged on a regular lattice ) , we , too , consider this situation in most of the simulations .",
    "thus , if not stated otherwise , our numerical experiments have been performed for this model .",
    "the results presented here have been obtained by means of a canonical procedure : in calculating @xmath79 , we take into account only the low - energy states with total charge equal to @xmath82 . when the grand canonical procedure is used for this aim , finite - size effects are more important since , due to differing total charge , some clusters remain separated from each other in configuration space even if @xmath83 .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss our numerical results in detail .",
    "first , we consider the non - ergodicity quotient @xmath78 . as examples , figs .",
    "2a and 2b illustrate for three - dimensional samples with two different degrees of disorder , how finite - size effects influence the dependence of @xmath78 on the duration of measurement @xmath38 .",
    "they show that finite - size effects are particularly important for large @xmath38 , where extended clusters of states have to be considered . however , if the sample size @xmath1 exceeds a certain value , roughly 500 for the cases considered here , @xmath78 is almost independent of @xmath1 .",
    "certainly , this limit depends on the concrete situation considered , i.e. , on @xmath65 , @xmath84 , and @xmath0 , and also on @xmath38 .    moreover , fig .",
    "2 leads to an important conclusion : the value of @xmath38 where @xmath78 reaches ( almost ) 1 can be interpreted as relaxation time of the specific heat .",
    "it exceeds typical experimental times by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates glassy behavior , where non - ergodic effects are fundamental .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show @xmath85 and its fluctuation @xmath86 defined by eq .",
    "these data illustrate that the measured values of @xmath80 are distributed within a wide range around the mean value , what originates from the varying properties of the separated clusters of states .",
    "this is a manifestation of the non - ergodic effects .",
    "however , for drawing further conclusions , a detailed study of the size dependence of @xmath86 would be needed .",
    "figure 4 displays the temperature dependence of the specific heat for two values of @xmath38 , as well as for thermal equilibrium ( infinite @xmath38 ) .",
    "moreover , this figure compares the changes caused by variation of @xmath65 with the influence of @xmath38 .",
    "now we study the non - ergodicity quotient @xmath78 in more detail .",
    "5 illustrates that the strength @xmath84 of the disorder has only a weak influence within the considered parameter range . only for @xmath87 , a small systematic shift of @xmath85 towards higher @xmath38 is detectable in comparison to the curves for stronger disorder .",
    "if @xmath38 is so large that @xmath78 reaches almost 1 , decreasing the disorder enhances the relevance of long - time correlations .    the influence of the temperature @xmath65 on @xmath78 is considered in fig .",
    "6 . for @xmath88 exceeding @xmath89",
    ", we observe the expected behavior , namely that decreasing @xmath65 is related to the increasing influence of non - ergodicity effects .",
    "however , we found a point , @xmath90 , where @xmath78 is almost independent of @xmath65 within the @xmath65 region studied . for smaller @xmath38",
    ", there is even some increase of @xmath78 with decreasing @xmath65 .",
    "presumably , the reason of this feature is the following . decreasing @xmath65 influences the cluster structure in two ways .",
    "on the one hand , it causes a division of clusters due to the decrease of transition rates , and thus an increase of the cluster number . on the other hand , however , the number of really relevant clusters decreases due to the decreasing occupation probability of excited states .",
    "we suppose that the second effect is dominating for small @xmath38 . there is some analogy to uncorrelated hopping conductivity , which increases exponentially with @xmath65 in the limit @xmath91 , but decreases as @xmath92 at high frequency @xcite . a similar behavior has also been found in the frequency dependence of the dielectric susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the question to which extent the obtained results are model dependent is answered in fig .",
    "7 . for the chosen disorder strength ,",
    "the results for the cib model and the random - position - with - random - potential model are almost identical . for the lattice model",
    ", however , the @xmath85 curve is a bit steeper , but the relaxation time of the specific heat is roughly the same as for the other models .",
    "thus , in the region of low @xmath78 , its @xmath85 curve is shifted towards higher @xmath38 .",
    "this effect probably originates from the missing of `` easy '' hops between closely neighboring sites .",
    "thus the influence of the spatial disorder of the donor sites is clearly stronger than the influence of the details of the random on - site potential @xmath18 .",
    "( in the cib model the acceptors create a potential which is almost gaussian with a width of 2.5 . )",
    "we have also studied the non - ergodicity quotient @xmath78 for one- and two - dimensional samples .",
    "the results , presented in fig .  8 ,",
    "are similar to the above findings for the three - dimensional case .",
    "however , there is a clear trend of non - ergodicity effects becoming more and more pronounced with decreasing dimension in the region of large @xmath38 .",
    "thus the reduction of the dimension seems to be related to a stronger `` localization '' of the particles .",
    "finally , we consider the question how the sample preparation influences @xmath85 .",
    "9 shows results for the lattice model . here",
    ", we compare samples being in thermal equilibrium with samples prepared by quenching . the latter curve is shifted towards larger @xmath38 . however",
    ", this effect decreases with increasing @xmath84 , compare with fig .  2 in @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural that the preparation conditions have a weaker influence for the other two coulomb glass models considered .",
    "in the previous sections , we have presented a numerical algorithm for studying the non - ergodic effects in the coulomb glass , which are very important at low temperatures .",
    "this method considers many - particle states , and takes into account correlations completely . here",
    ", it has been used for investigating how the mean value of the specific heat @xmath79 depends on the measuring time .",
    "the main results of our numerical experiments are summarized in the following points :    ( )    the non - ergodicity quotient @xmath93 strongly depends on the measuring time @xmath38 .",
    "it vanishes as @xmath94 , and , in the cases studied here , it approaches 1 only for values of @xmath38 which exceed realistic measuring times by orders of magnitude .    for large @xmath38",
