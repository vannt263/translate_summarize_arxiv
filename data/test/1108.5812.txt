    "the former includes the three - dimensional graphite , zero - dimensional fullerenes such as c@xmath0 , one - dimensional carbon nanotube , and two - dimensional graphene .",
    "these sp2 bonding materials have been investigated one by one and have achieved some industrial applications . as well known , the sp3 bonding diamond is the hardest material and of high thermal conductivity .",

    "the dnw may inherit various advanced properties from diamond and gain new characters from its nanowire configuration of tunable surface to volume ratio ( svr ) .",
    "prior to the experiment , in 2003 , barnard _ et  al . _ have done a series of theoretical works to investigate the stability and possible phase transition for the structure of dnw.@xcite the _ ab intio _ calculations show that the structure relaxation of dnw depends on both the surface morphology and the growth direction@xcite .",
    "the effect of the boron and nitrogen dopants on the structure stability of the dnw was also examined by the same group@xcite .",
    "they also found that the energy band gap of dnw is reduced considerably due to the effect of surface states@xcite . in 2008 , tanskanen _",
    "_ carried out quantum chemical calculations to study the the structural , electronic , and mechanical properties of dnw.@xcite since 2004 , there is quite few theoretical works on the dnw , as it was a challenge to grow the dnw for experimentalists at that time .",
    "as now the dnw samples have been successfully prepared , it is an urgent task to pursue theoretical studies on important properties of the dnw .",
    "the thermal transport is one of the very important phenomena in the quasi - one - dimensional nanowire structures , where the phonon spectrum modification and boundary scattering are important.@xcite some possible practical applications of the phonon confinement effect has also been found.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the thermal conductivity in the dnw by molecular dynamics simulation using the tersoff@xcite and brenner@xcite empirical inter - atomic potentials .",
    "we show that the thermal conductivity of thicker dnw decreases with increasing temperature due to phonon phonon scattering ( pps ) , yet does not depend on temperature in narrower dnw where surface scattering is important .",

    "the dnw is cut from the bulk diamond crystal by using a virtual cylinder with structure parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4)@xcite , so that the cross section is always a circle and the diameter is well defined to be the diameter of the virtual cylinder .",

    "the surface roughness can be introduced to manipulate the thermal conductivity through generating some vacancies on the surface which produces some free bonds on the surface . in this sense ,",
    "the free boundary condition on the surface is actually equivalent to a rough surface .",

    "the strong youngs moduli may have relation to the redistribution of the elastic deformations during the relaxation of the surface atoms in the dnw , which happens in the acoustically mismatched nanowires as discussed by pokatilov _ et.al_.@xcite as discussed above , the largest group velocity in dnw[110 ] leads to highest thermal conductivity in dnw[110 ] and obvious temperature dependence for @xmath13 shown in fig .",
