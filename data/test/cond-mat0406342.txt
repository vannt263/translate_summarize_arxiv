    "the single - electron transistor ( set ) is a highly charge - sensitive electro - meter and has been suggested as a readout device for solid - state charge qubits @xcite or spin qubits @xcite ( through a measurement of a spin - dependent charge transfer ) .",
    "the problem of a charge qubit subject to a measurement by a set has been extensively studied in refs .   and .",
    "we refer to the approach of these papers as the master equation method of the `` partially '' reduced density matrix . in this approach",
    ", one takes a trace over environmental ( detector ) microscopic degrees of the freedom but keeps track of the number of electrons , @xmath3 , that have tunneled through the set into the drain during time @xmath2 in the `` partially '' reduced density matrix .",
    "if experimentally the number of accumulated electrons or current passing through the set is measured , this approach can provide us with information about the initial qubit state .",
    "but , the system dynamics in this approach is still deterministic ; i.e. , this approach is still in an ensemble and time average sense .",
    "a monte carlo method @xcite which allows one to follow each electron tunneling event has been successfully applied to simulate transport properties of a set or more complicated single electronics circuits .",
    "this method gives physical insight into the processes taking place in the simulated system .",
    "but to our knowledge , it has not yet been formally applied to quantum measurement problems by a set detector . in this paper , we provide such an investigation .",
    "we derive the _ quantum - jump _ stochastic master equation ( or quantum trajectory equation ) for a single superconducting cooper - pair box ( scb ) charge qubit ( generalization to other charge qubit case is simple ) continuously measured by a set .",
    "this stochastic master equation describes the random evolution of the measured scb qubit density matrix which both conditions and is conditioned on a particular realization of the measured electron tunneling events through the set junctions . we can regard it as a monte carlo method that allows us to simulate the continuous quantum measurement process of a charge qubit by a set .",
    "this quantum trajectory approach ( or bayesian formalism ) was introduced recently @xcite to describe a charge qubit measured by a low - transparency point contact detector .",
    "here we present the _ quantum - jump _ stochastic master equation for the set detector .",
    "especially , we show that the master equation for the `` partially '' reduced density matrix ( a `` partial '' course - grain description ) presented in refs .   and",
    "can be obtained by taking a `` partial '' average on the stochastic master equation over the fine grained measurement records of the tunneling events in the set . finally , we present some monte carlo simulation results for the scb / set measurement process .",
    "we also analyze an important ensemble quantity for an initial qubit state readout experiment , @xmath0 the probability distribution @xcite of finding @xmath1 electrons that have tunneled into the drain of the set in time @xmath2 .",
    "this analysis demonstrates further the connection between the quantum trajectory approach presented here and the `` partially '' reduced density matrix approach in refs .   and .",
    "the hamiltonian of the scb / set system is described in refs .   and as : @xmath4 briefly , @xmath5 describes the charging energy of the set .",
    "the charge on the middle island is @xmath6 , and the induced charge @xmath7 is determined by the gate voltage @xmath8 and other voltages in the circuit .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 , describes microscopic degrees of freedom of noninteracting electrons in the two leads ( left and right ) and the middle island of the set , respectively . to make the charge transfer explicit , two `` macroscopic '' operators , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are included in the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite in the set : @xmath13 the effective hamiltonian of the uncoupled qubit , written in the charge eigen basis of the number @xmath14 of extra cooper pair on the island of scb , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 with eigenvalues @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the capacitive coulomb coupling between the charge on the set island and that on the scb qubit is represented by @xmath19    we will consider the case that the leading tunneling process in the set are sequential transitions between two adjacent charge states @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( say , @xmath22 and @xmath23 states to represent the extra charge on the set island ) .",
    "this would be the case if the applied transport voltage across the set is not too high and the temperature is low ( for simplicity , we consider the zero temperature case ) . since , effectively , only two adjacent charge states @xmath22 and @xmath23 are considered , the charge transfer operators @xmath24 , in this case , satisfy @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the other set of charge transfer operators satisfy @xmath28 , where @xmath1 represents the number of electrons that has tunneled into the right lead ( drain ) of the set .",
    "to be able to describe the measured qubit in a pure state continuously , one needs to have the maximum knowledge about the change of its state .",
    "when the qubit interacts with ( is measured by ) the set , this information is lost to the set .",
    "for example , each time when an electron tunnels onto or off the set island , it will cause a change ( e.g. , a phase shift ) of the qubit state .",
    "one can recover this information lost , provided that a detailed measurement record from the set is available .",
    "the transport of electrons through the set occurs via real states of the central island , from @xmath29 .",
    "the information of detecting the @xmath30 electron just tunneling into the drain only tells us that the island state now is in @xmath31 state . thus knowing the `` partially '' reduced density matrix @xmath32 at every time @xcite does not provide us with the full information .",
    "one can imagine that in the transport process , electrons may spend different times in the intermediate @xmath33 state , causing different phase shifts to the qubit .",
    "if the record of the times when electrons tunneling onto and off the island is not available from the measurement results of the set , our knowledge about the precise qubit state decreases . when this happens , averaging the random dwelling times of electrons on the island over a period of time or over an ensemble of systems will then lead to the decoherence of the qubit .",
    "hence , one needs to have a measurement record which records whether or not an electron tunnels onto or off the central island of the set at each time interval @xmath34 .",
    "this time interval @xmath34 should be much smaller than the typical qubit system evolution or response time so that no information is lost as far as the qubit system evolution is concerned . in this sense , effectively the qubit is continuously monitored or measured .    for this purpose",
    ", we introduce @xmath35 and @xmath36 to represent , in the _ quantum - jump _ case @xcite , the number ( either zero or one ) of tunneling events seen in infinitesimal time @xmath34 through the left and right junctions of the set , respectively . throughout the paper ,",
    "the subscript or superscript @xmath37 indicates that the quantity to which it is attached is conditioned on previous measurement results . if no tunneling electron is detected , the result is _ null _ , i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "if there is _ detection _ of a tunneling electron in time @xmath34 , then @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "we can think of @xmath36 as the increment in the number of electrons @xmath42 passing through the right junction of the set into the drain in the infinitesimal time @xmath34 .",
    "it is the variable @xmath43 , the accumulated electron number transmitted through the set in the drain , which is used in refs . and .",
    "since the nature of detection results is classical and that of electrons tunneling through the set is stochastic , @xmath44 should represent a classical random process .",
    "the measurement record in each single run of experiment is the set of times @xmath45 and @xmath46 when electrons tunnel onto or off the set island , respectively [ i.e. , ones of @xmath35 and @xmath36 over the entire detection time ; see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : traj](i ) and ( j ) ] .    at first",
    ", one may expect that at the end of each time interval @xmath34 , there are four possible measurement outcomes , @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 \\ , [ 1-dn_{rc}(t)]$ ] , and @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to realize that a null result ( e.g. , @xmath51 ) in a time interval @xmath34 is still a measurement result or outcome .",
    "let us consider the case in the sequential tunneling dominated regime that the probability of electrons tunneling onto and off the set island within the same infinitesimal time interval @xmath34 is rather small .",
    "in fact , the respective probability of @xmath35 or @xmath36 equal to unity is proportional to @xmath34 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ dnl ] ) and ( [ dnr ] ) ] .",
    "thus the product of @xmath52 occurs with probability proportional to @xmath53 . since we shall keep only terms to order @xmath34 in the master equations",
    ", we can neglect the case that @xmath35 and @xmath36 both equal one within the same infinitesimal time interval .",
    "the possible measurement outcomes then become : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the first two terms , in this case , represent that an electron tunneling event through , respectively , the left and right junctions of set is measured at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) . while the last term @xmath54 $ ] represents that no tunneling event is observed in [ @xmath55 ) .",
    "thus the conditioned density matrix @xmath56 to order @xmath34 at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) can be written as @xmath57 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1 cm } + dn_{rc}(t ) \\frac{w_{r1c}(t+dt)}{{\\rm tr}[w_{r1c}(t+dt ) ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1 cm } + [ 1-dn_{lc}(t)-dn_{rc}(t ) ] \\frac{w_{0c}(t+dt)}{{\\rm tr}[w_{0c}(t+dt ) ] } , \\label{conddm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the unnormalized density matrices , given that an electron tunneling event through left or right junction of the set island , or no tunneling event is measured at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) .",
