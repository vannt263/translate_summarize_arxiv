    "a great challenge in modern times is the construction of predictive theories for nonlinear dynamical systems for which the evolution equations are barely known , if known at all .",
    "general or so - called universal laws are aimed at from very noisy data .",
    "a universal law should hold for different systems characterized by different models , but leading to similar basic parameters , like the critical exponents , depending only on the dimensionality of the system and the number of components of the order parameter .",
    "this _ in fine _ leads to a predictive value or power of the universal laws .    in order to obtain universal laws in stochastic systems",
    "one has to distinguish true noise from chaotic behavior , and sort out coherent sequences from random ones in experimentally obtained signals @xcite .",
    "the stochastic aspects are not only found in the statistical distribution of underlying frequencies characterizing the fourier transform of the signal , but also in the amplitude fluctuation distribution and high moments or correlation functions .",
    "following the scaling hypothesis idea , neither time nor length scales have to be considered @xcite .",
    "henceforth the fractal geometry is a perfect framework for studies of stochastic systems which do not appear at first to have underlying scales .",
    "a universal law can be a so - called _ scaling _ law if a @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 plot gives a straight line ( over several decades if possible ) leading to a slope measurement and the exponent characterizing the power law .",
    "when examining such phenomena , it is often recognized that some _ coherent factor _ is implied .",
    "yet there are states which can not be reached without going through intricate evolutions , implying concepts like _ transience _ and _ persistence _ , - well known if one recalls the turbulence phenomenon and its basic theoretical understanding @xcite .",
    "finally , the _ apparent roughness _ of the signal can be put in mathematical terms .",
    "these concepts are briefly elaborated upon in sect .",
    "2 .    in the @xmath2 function",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be many ",
    "however the relevant outlined concepts can be well illustrated when @xmath4 is the time @xmath5 variable .",
    "in so doing time series serve as fundamental testing grounds .",
    "several series can be found in the literature .",
    "financial time series and mathematical ones based on the weierstrass - mandelbrot function @xcite describing fractional ( or not ) brownian walks can be used for illustration .",
    "the number of points should be large enough to obtain small error bars .",
    "a few useful references , among many others , discussing tests and other basic or technical considerations on non linear time series analysis are to be found in @xcite .    mathematical series , like ( fractional or not ) brownian motions ( @xmath6 ) and practical ones , like financial time series , are thus of interest for discussion or illustrations as done in sect.3 .",
    "there are several papers and books for interest geared at financial time series analysis ... and forecasting .",
    "again not all can be mentioned , though see @xcite . on a more general basis , an introduction to financial market analysis _ per se _ , can be found in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it should be considered that any `` scaling exponent '' should be robust in a statistical sense with respect to small changes in the data or in the data analysis technique .",
    "if this is so some physics considerations and modeling can be pursued .",
    "one question is often raised for statistical purposes whether the data is _ stationary _ or not , i.e. whether the analyzed raw signal , or any of its combinations depend on the ( time ) origin of the series .",
    "this theoretical question seems somewhat practically irrelevant in financial , meteorological , ... sciences because the data is obviously _ never _ stationary .",
    "in fact , in such new",
    " exotic applications of physics  a restricted criterion for stationarity is thought to be sufficient : if the data statistical mean and the whatever - extracted - parameter do not change too much ( up to some statistical significance  @xcite ) the data is called @xmath7 . if so it can be next offered for fundamental investigations .",
    "thereafter , the prefix  quasi  is immediately forgotten and not written anymore .",
    "several characteristics plots leading to _ universality considerations _ , thus fractal - like exponents are first to be recalled .",
    "they are obtained from different techniques which are briefly reviewed for completeness either in sect . 3 or in appendices .",
    "some technical materials can be usefully found in @xcite .",
    "this should serve to distinguish how the various exponents are measured , and what basic differences exist between each one .",
    "the numerical values pertaining to the words ( i ) persistence , ( ii ) coherence , and ( iii ) roughness will be given and related to each other . from a practical point of view , as illustrated in the exercice session which was taking place after the lecture , the cases of foreign exchange currency rates , i.e. dem / usd and dem / jpy are used .",
    "they are shown in fig.1 and 2 for a time interval ranging from jan . 01 , 1993 till june 30 , 2000 .",
    "for an adequate perspective , let it be recalled that such modern concepts of statistical physics have been recently applied in analyzing time series outside finance as well , like in particular those arising from biology @xcite , medicine @xcite , meteorology @xcite , electronics @xcite , image recognition @xcite , ... again without intending to list all references of interest as should be done in a ( longer ) review paper .",
    "many examples can also be found in this book through contributions by world specialists of computer simulations .",
    "when mentioning the word coherence to any student in physics , he / she is immediately thinking about  lasers  , - that is where the word has been most striking in any scientific memory .",
    "it is recalled that the laser is a so interesting instrument because all photons are emitted in _ phase _ ,",
    "more exactly the difference in phases between emitted waves is a constant in time . thus there is a so - called _ coherence _ in the light beam .",
    "they are other cases in which phase coherence occurs , let it be recalled that light bugs are emitting coherently  @xcite , young girls in dormitories have their period in a coherent way , driving conditions are best if some coherence is imposed  @xcite , crystals have a better shape and properties if they are grown in a  coherent way  ; sand piles and stock markets seem also to have coherent properties @xcite .      no need to say that a wave is characterized by its _ amplitude _ which has also some known importance in measurements indeed , be it often the measure of an intensity ( the square of the amplitude ) .",
    "more interestingly one can define the _ roughness _ of a profile by observing how the signal amplitude varies in time ( and space if necessary ) , in particular the correlation between the various amplitude fluctuations .",
    "on the other hand , it can be easily shown that a periodic signal can be decomposed into a series of @xmath8 or @xmath9 for which the frequencies are in arithmetic order .",
    "thus , the third  parameter  of the wave is its _",
    "frequency_. some ( regular ) frequency effect is surely apparent in all cycling phenomena , starting from biology , climatology , meteorology , astronomy , but also stock markets , foreign currency exchange markets , tectonics events , traffic and turbulence , and politics . for non periodic signals , the fourier transform has been introduced in order to sort out the distribution of frequencies of interest , i.e. the  density of modes  .",
    "the distribution defines the sort of _ persistence _ of a phenomenon .",
    "it might be also examined whether the frequencies are distributed in a geometrical progression , rather than following an ordinary / usual arithmetic progression , i.e. whether the phenomena might be log - periodical , like in antennas , earthquakes and stock market crashes @xcite .",
    "data from a ( usually discrete ) time series @xmath10 are one dimensional sets and are more simple to analyze at first than spatial ones @xcite . below and for simplicity one considers that the measurements are taken at equal time intervals .",
    "thus for financial time series , there is no holiday nor week - end .",
    "a more general situation is hardly necessary here .",
    "two classic examples of a mathematical univariate stochastic time series are those resulting from brownian motion and levy walk cases @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the power spectral density @xmath11 of the ( supposed to be self - affine ) time series @xmath10 has a single power - law dependence on the frequency @xmath12 ,    @xmath13    following from the fourier transform    @xmath14    for @xmath10 one can use the weierstrass - mandelbrot ( fractal ) function @xcite @xmath15 ~e^{i\\phi_nt},\\ ] ]    with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the phase @xmath18 can be stochastic or deterministic . for illustration ,",
    "berry and lewis @xcite took @xmath18 = n @xmath19 , with @xmath19 = 0 or @xmath20 .",
    "the function obeys    @xmath21    is stationary , and its trend , in the deterministic cases , is given by    @xmath22    the power spectrum is easily calculated @xcite to be @xmath23    one could search whether the function moments obey power laws with characterizing exponents .",
    "equation(1 ) allows one to put the phenomena into the _ self - affine _ class of persistent phenomena characterized by the @xmath24 value .",
    "the range over which @xmath24 is well defined in eq.(1 ) indicates the range of the persistence in the time series .",
    "a brownian motion is characterized by @xmath24 = 2 , and a white noise by @xmath24 = 0 .",
    "see a very interesting set of such mathematical signals and the corresponding power spectrum in @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform , or power spectrum , of the financial signals used for illustration here are found in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 . notice the large error bars , allowing to estimate that @xmath24 is about equal to 2 , as for a trivial brownian motion case .",
    "however the coherence and/or roughness aspect are masked in this one - shot analysis .",
    "only the persistence behavior is touched upon .",
    "if the distribution of fluctuations is not a power law , or if marked deviations exist , say the _ statistical correlation coefficient _ is less than @xmath25 , indicating that a mere power law for @xmath26 is doubtful , a more thorough search of the basic frequencies is in order .",
    "a crucial step is to extract deterministic or stochastic components  @xcite , e.g. the stochastic aspects found in the statistical distribution of values show its persistence to be either nonexistent ( white noise case ) or existent , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "if so the persistence can be qualitatively thought to be strong or weak .",
    "the fourier transform can sometimes indicate the presence of specific frequencies , much more abundant than others , in particular if cycles exist , as in meteorology and climatology .",
    "the range of the persistence is obtained from the correlations between events .",
    "a  short  or  long range ",
    "is checked through the autocorrelation function , usually @xmath28 .",
    "this function is a particular case of the so - called",
    " @xmath29th order structure function ",
    "@xcite or  @xmath29th order height - height correlation function  of the ( normalized ) time - dependent signal @xmath30 ,    @xmath31    where only non - zero terms are considered in the average @xmath32 taken over all couples @xmath33 such that @xmath34 . in so doing one can obtain a set of exponents @xmath35    if the autocorrelation is larger than unity for some long time @xmath5 one can talk about strong persistence , otherwise it is weak .",
    "this criterion defines the scale of time @xmath5 in @xmath10 for which there is long or short ( time ) range persistence .",
    "notice that the lower limit of the time scale is due to the discretization step , and this sets the highest frequency to be the inverse of twice the discretizatin interval .",
    "the upper limit is obvious .",
    "the fractal dimensionciterefa1,addison , falconer , roughness @xmath36 is often used to characterize the roughness of profiles @xcite .",
    "several methods are used for measuring @xmath36 , like the box counting method , not quite but are not quite efficient ; many others are found in the literature as seen in @xcite and here below . for topologically one dimensional systems ,",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath36 is related to the exponent @xmath24 by    @xmath37    a brownian motion is characterized by @xmath36 = 3/2 , and a white noise by @xmath36 = 2.0 @xcite .",
    "another  measure  of a signal roughness is sometimes given by the hurst @xmath38 exponent , first defined in the  rescale range theory  ( of hurst  @xcite ) who measured the nile flooding and drought amplitudes .",
    "the hurst method consists in listing the differences between the observed value at a discrete time @xmath5 over an interval with size @xmath39 on which the mean has been taken .",
    "the upper ( @xmath40 ) and lower ( @xmath41 ) values in that interval define the range @xmath42 .",
    "the root mean square deviation @xmath43 being also calculated , the  rescaled range ",
    "is @xmath44 is expected to behave like @xmath45 .",
    "this means that for a ( discrete ) self - affine signal @xmath10 , the neighborhood of a particular point on the signal can be rescaled by a factor @xmath46 using the roughness ( or hurst @xcite ) exponent @xmath38 and defining the new signal @xmath47 . for the exponent value @xmath38 , the frequency dependence of the signal",
    "so obtained should be undistinguishable from the original one , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "the roughness ( hurst ) exponent @xmath38 can be calculated from the height - height correlation function @xmath48 supposed to behave like @xmath49 whereas @xmath50 rather than from the box counting method . for a _ persistent _ signal , @xmath51 ; for an _ anti - persistent _ signal , @xmath52 .",
    "flandrin has theoretically proved @xcite that    @xmath53    thus @xmath24 = 1 + 2 @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the classical random walk ( brownian motion ) is such that @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that    @xmath56    fractional brownian motion values are practically found to lie between @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite . since",
    "a white noise is a truly random process , it can be concluded that @xmath59 implies an uncorrelated time series @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath60 , or @xmath61 implies antipersistence and @xmath62 , or @xmath63 implies persistence . from preimposed @xmath38 values of a fractional brownian motion series",
    ", it is found that the equality here above usually holds true in a very limited range and @xmath24 only slowly converges toward the value @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the inertia axes of the _ 2-variability diagram _",
    "@xcite seem to be related to these values and could be used for fast measurements as well .",
    "the above results can be compared to those obtained from the detrended fluctuation analysis   @xcite ( @xmath64 ) method .",
    "@xmath64 @xcite consists in dividing a random variable sequence @xmath65 over @xmath39 points into @xmath66 boxes , each containing @xmath67 points . the best linear trend @xmath68 in each box is defined .",
    "the fluctuation function @xmath69 is then calculated following @xmath70 averaging @xmath71 over the @xmath66 intervals gives the fluctuations @xmath72 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "if the @xmath65 data are random uncorrelated variables or short range correlated variables , the behavior is expected to be a power law @xmath73 with @xmath74 different from @xmath75 .",
    "the exponent @xmath74 is so - labelled for hausdorff @xcite .",
    "it is expected , not always proved as emphasized by @xcite that    @xmath76    where @xmath36 is the self - affine fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "it is immediately seen that @xmath77    for brownian motion , @xmath78 , while for white noise @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath64 log - log plots of the dem / jpy and dem / usd exchange rates are given in fig .",
    "5 and fig .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath81 fulfills the above relations for the dem / jpy and dem / usd data , since @xmath81 = 0.55 .",
    "both @xmath74 and @xmath36 readily measure the roughness and persistence strength .",
    "fractional brownian motion @xmath74 values are found to lie between @xmath82 and @xmath57 .",
    "the effect of a trend is supposedly eliminated here .",
    "however only the linear or cubic detrending have been studied to my knowledge @xcite .",
    "other trends , emphasizing some characteristic frequency , like seasonal cycles , could be further studied .",
    "a generalized hurst exponent @xmath83 is defined through the relation @xmath84 where @xmath85 has been defined here above    the _ intermittency _ of the signal can be studied through the so - called singular measure analysis of the small - scale gradient field obtained from the data through    @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an integer .",
    "the scaling properties of the generating function are then searched for through the equation    @xmath89    with @xmath67 as defined above .",
    "the @xmath90-exponent is closely related to the generalized dimensions @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity of both characteristics exponents , @xmath92 and @xmath90 , describes the multifractality of the signal .",
    "if a linear dependence is obtained , then the signal is monofractal or in other words , the data follows a simple scaling law for these values of @xmath93 .",
    "thus the exponent @xcite @xmath94 is a measure of the intermittency lying in the signal @xmath65 and can be numerically estimated by measuring @xmath95 around @xmath96 . some conjecture on the role / meaning of @xmath54",
    "is found in @xcite . from some financial and political data analysis",
    "it seems that @xmath54 is a measure of the information entropy of the system .",
    "it has been emphasized that to analyze stochastic time series , like those describing fractional brownian motion and foreign currency exchange rates reduces to examining the distribution of and correlations between amplitudes , frequencies an phases of harmonic - like components of the signal . due to some scaling hypothesis ,",
    "characteristic exponents can be obtained to describe power laws .",
    "the usefulness of such exponents serves in determining universality classes , and _ in fine _ building physical or algorithmic models . in the case of financial times",
    "series , the exponents can even serve into imagining some investment strategy @xcite .",
    "notice that due to the non stationarity of the data , such exponents vary with time , and multifractal concepts must be brought in at a refining stage , - including in an investment strategy .    in that spirit ,",
    "let it be emphasized here the analogy between a @xmath97 diagram and the @xmath98 diagram of dynamical second order phase transitions @xcite . in the latter the frequency and the phase of a time signal are considered on the same footing , and encompass the critical and hydrodynamical regions . in the present cases an analog diagram relates the roughness and intermittency .",
    "this has been already examined in @xcite .    among other various physical data analysis techniques which have been recently presented in order to obtain some information on the deterministic and/or chaotic content of univariate data ,",
    "let us point out the wavelet technique which has been considerably used ( several references exist , see below ) including for dna and meteorology studies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath97 technique used in turbulence and meteorology @xcite is also somewhat appropriate .",
    ".values of the most relevant exponents in various regimes ( i.e. , stationary , persistent , antipersistent ) of univariate stochastic series : @xmath36 : fractal dimension ; @xmath74 : hausdorff measure ; @xmath38 : hurst exponent ; @xmath99 : from dfa technique ; @xmath24 : power spectrum exponent : @xmath100 = white noise , @xmath101 : ( fractional ) brownian motion ; @xmath102 : flat spectrum . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are many other techniques which are not mentioned here , like the weighted fixed point @xcite , and the time - delay embedding @xcite",
    ". surely several others have been used , but only those relevant for the present purpose have been fully mentioned hereabove . as a summary of the above , table 1 indicates the range of values found for different signals and their relationship to stationarity , persistence and coherence . in the many years to come",
    ", it seems relevant to ask for more data on multivariate functions , thus extending the above considerations to other real mathematical and physical cases in higher dimensions .",
    "finally , two short appendices should follow in order to remain consistent with the oral lectures .",
    "it was shown that another time series  analysis  technique is often used by experts for some predictability purpose , i.e. the _ moving average technique_. it is briefly discussed in appendix a. it has served in the _",
    "bungen_. also , these lecture notes would be incomplete without mentioning the intrinsic _ discrete scale invariance _ implication in time series .",
    "such a substructure leads to log - periodic oscillations in the time series , whence to fascinating effects and surprises in predicting crash - like events .",
    "this is mentioned in appendix b.    1.0 cm * acknowledgements *    thanks to k. ivanova for very useful discussions , and for preparing the data and drawings .",
    "a. pkalski kindly reviewed the manuscript and has much improved it due to his usual and well known pedagogical insight .",
    "great thanks go to the organizers of the we - heraeus - ferienkurse fr physik in den neuen bundeslndern 2000 , chemnitz , `` vom billardtisch bis monte carlo - spielfelder der statistischen physik '' for inviting me to present these ideas and techniques , and to the students for their questions , comments and output during the _ bungen_.",
    "to take into account the trend can be shown to be irrelevant for such short range correlation events .",
    "the trend is anyway quite ill defined since it is a statistical mean , and thus depends on the size of the interval , i.e. the number of data points which is taken into account .",
    "nevertheless many technical analyses rely on signal averages over various time intervals , like the moving average method @xcite .",
    "these methods shold be examined form a physical point of view .",
    "an interesting observation has resulted from checking the density of intersections of such mean values over different time interval windows , which are continuously shifted .",
    "this corresponds to obtaining a spectrum of the so - called moving averages @xcite , used by analysts in order to point to  gold  or  death  crosses in a market .",
    "the density @xmath103 of crossing points between any two moving averages is obviously a measure of long - range power - law correlations in the signal .",
    "it has been found that @xmath103 is a symmetric function of @xmath104 , i.e. the difference between the interval sizes on which the averages are taken , and it has a simple power law form @xcite .",
    "this leads to a very fast and rather reliable measure of the fractal dimension of th signal .",
    "the method can be easily implemented for obtaining the time evolution of @xmath36 , thus for elementary investment strategies .",
    "it has been proposed that an economic index @xmath10 follows a complex power law @xcite , i.e.      for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the crash - time or rupture point , a , b , @xmath88 , c , @xmath108 , @xmath109 are parameters .",
    "this index evolution is a power law ( @xmath88 ) divergence ( for @xmath110 ) on which log - periodic ( @xmath108 ) oscillations are taking place .",
    "the law for @xmath10 diverges at @xmath5=@xmath107 with an exponent @xmath88 ( for @xmath110 ) while the period of the oscillations converges to the rupture point at @xmath111 .",
    "this law is similar to that of critical points at so - called second order phase transitions @xcite , but generalizes the scaleless situation for cases in which discrete scale invariance is presupposed @xcite .",
    "this relationship was already proposed in order to fit experimental measurements of sound wave rate emissions prior to the rupture of heterogeneous composite stressed up to failure @xcite .",
    "the same type of complex power law behavior has been observed as a precursor of the kobe earthquake in japan @xcite .",
    "fits using eq.(23 ) were performed on the @xmath112 data @xcite for the period preceding the 1987 october crash .",
    "the parameter values have not been found to be robust against small perturbations , like a change in the phase of the signal .",
    "it is known in fact that a nonlinear seven parameter fit is highly unstable from a numerical point of view . indeed , eliminating the contribution of the oscillations in eq.(1 ) , i.e. setting c=0",
    ", implies that the best fit leads to an exponent @xmath113 quite larger than @xmath114 for c @xmath115 0 @xcite .",
    "feigenbaum and freund @xcite also reported various values of @xmath88 ranging from 0.53 to 0.06 for various indexes and events ( upsurges and crashes ) .",
    "universality in this case means that the value of @xmath88 should be the same for any crash and for any index . in",
    "so doing a single model should describe the phase transition , and the exponent would define the model and be the only parameter .",
    "a limiting case of a power law behavior is the logarithmic behavior , corresponding to @xmath88 = 0 , i.e. the divergence of the index @xmath3 for @xmath5 close to @xmath107 should be      this logarithmic behavior is known in physics as characterizing the specific heat ( `` four point correlation function '' ) of the ising model , and the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite in spatial dimensions equal to two .",
    "they are thus specific to systems with a low order dimension of the order parameter .",
    "it is nevertheless a smooth transition .",
    "the mean value of the order parameter @xcite is not defined over long range scales , but a phase transition nevertheless exists because there is some ordered state on small scales .",
    "in addition to the physical interpretation of the latter relationship , the advantages are that ( i ) the number of parameters is reduced by one , and ( ii ) the log - divergence seems to be close to reality .    in order to test the validity of eq.(24 ) in the vicinity of crashes , we have separated the problems of the divergence itself and the oscillation convergences on the other hand , in order to extract two values for the rupture point @xmath107 : ( i ) @xmath117 for the power ( or logarithmic ) divergence and ( ii ) @xmath118 for the oscillation convergence . in so doing the long range and",
    "short range fluctuation scales are examined on an equal footing .",
    "the final @xmath107 is obtained at the intersection of two straight lines , by successive iteration fits .",
    "the results of the fit as well as the correlation fitting factor @xmath119 have been given in @xcite .",
    "a technical point is in order : the rupture point @xmath118 is estimated by selecting the maxima and the minima of the oscillations through a double envelope technique @xcite .",
    "finally notice that the oscillation basic frequency depends on the connectivity of the underlying space @xcite .",
    "the log - periodic behavior also corresponds to a complex fractal dimension @xcite .",
