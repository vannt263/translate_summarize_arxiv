    "recent progress in creating artificial magnetic heterostructures @xcite gives an impetus to the theory of phase transitions in multilayers .",
    "while the related experimental and theoretical efforts have been so far mostly concentrated at microscopic effects , this paper addresses the problem of universal features associated with large scale ordering in superlattices .",
    "suppose the superlattice is built of atomically thick layers of two magnets , which taken separately both order through second order phase transitions at two respective bulk critical points @xmath5 .",
    "suppose also for simplicity that both components are _ ferro_-magnets and that the critical behavior at their bulk curie points is similar , i. e. both components belong to the same universality class .",
    "the question then is : at what temperature @xmath6 will long range ferromagnetic order appear in the superlattice and what critical behavior will be observed at that temperature ?",
    "one can reasonably expect that in the limit of thick layers the answers to these questions will be largely universal , depending only on the bulk critical properties of the two components and the geometry of the superlattice ; these universal aspects of the problem represent the subject of this paper .",
    "we will consider the simplest superlattice geometry ( fig .",
    "1 ) constructed of two elementary building blocks : slabs , or layers , of two ferromagnets , 1 and 2 , of finite thickness @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the slabs are stacked periodically in the @xmath9-direction , so that @xmath10 is the period .",
    "the system is homogeneous in the remaining @xmath11 dimensions . while the dimensionality @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1a ) is naturally the most interesting one in view of experimental applications , the planar , @xmath12 , superlattice geometry can be quite conceivably realized by cutting a thin film out of a three - dimensional multilayered sample ( fig .",
    "1b ) or by deposition of a magnetic film on a substrate , which is itself cut out of a superlattice .",
    "extension of our consideration to @xmath12 is important because of analytical tractability of two - dimensional models .",
    "being interested in the long wave length aspects of the problem , we will consider the limit of atomically thick slabs : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the thicknesses of elementary , molecular layers of the two components , respectively ; correspondingly , the interfaces separating two subsequents slabs do not have to be atomically smooth .",
    "naturally , universality extends applicability of the results obtained below beyond this particular magnetic model ; among other interesting applications are a superfluid in a periodic matrix and a superfluid film deposited on a periodic substrate .",
    "universal critical phenomena related to three different geometrical elements present in a superlattice have been extensively studied theoretically and , to a variable extent , experimentally .",
    "first , at a _ single _ interface separating _ half - infinite _ near - critical , say @xmath15 and disordered , @xmath16 , magnets , one expects _ ordinary surface critical _ phenomena to take place at the near - critical side of the interface . it has been established theoretically @xcite that the critical exponents and amplitudes characterizing surface values of various observables are quite different from those in the bulk , as well as from the @xmath17-dimensional ones . however , experimental confirmation of those theoretical findings has turned out to be difficult .",
    "note that near @xmath18 , where the other half of the single interface model goes through the criticality , the first one is already ordered and imposes a magnetic field acting at the surface of the second component . therefore , one expects _",
    "normal surface critical _ behavior @xcite to take place at the interface near @xmath18 .",
    "second , near the bulk critical temperature @xmath19 of the @xmath20-th , @xmath21 , component a thick , @xmath22 , _ single _ slab of that component exhibits a dimensional crossover from the critical behavior characteristic of bulk , @xmath0-dimensional , samples to the @xmath11-dimensional critical behavior , as observed in thin films of the same material @xcite",
    ". we will refer to this crossover as _ bulk - to - film _ below ; it has been observed experimentally @xcite . finally , in a system of _ thin _ layers connected to each other by very",
    "interlayer bonds , near the critical temperature @xmath23 of a single layer one expects a crossover from @xmath17-dimensional to the bulk , @xmath0-dimensional behavior , which we will call _ film - to - bulk _ crossover below .",
    "this type of dimensional crossover has been well experimentally documented in a variety of magnetic @xcite and non - magnetic layered systems @xcite .",
    "one source of motivation for studying critical phenomena in multilayers is that the significantly increased surface - to - volume ratio may improve chances of observing features characteristic of the @xmath12-dimensional and , especially , the elusive @xmath2-surface critical behavior with respect to experiments involving single thin film or semi - bulk samples .",
    "however , finite separation between interfaces in a superlattice leads to correlations between fluctuations in different layers and at different interfaces .",
    "one therefore expects surface and two - dimensional scaling to be limited to a certain range of length scales , while eventually cooperative phenomena involving fluctuations on scales larger than the period of the superlattice will dominate the criticality .",
    "a crucial insight comes from the exact solution available for a ferromagnetic @xmath12-ising superlattice , as modelled by a planar ising model composed of alternating strips of two components @xcite .",
    "recent analysis @xcite demonstrated that the anomalous changes in the critical amplitudes and other interesting features of that model can be simply explained by _",
    "reentrant dimensional crossover _ : as the temperature approaches the critical temperature of the superlattice the long wave length properties of the system are successively dominated by fluctuations characteristic of the the @xmath12-ising , then @xmath24-ising , and then again @xmath12-ising critical behavior .    here we generalize and explore this picture by constructing and analyzing a renormalization group ( rg ) flow which provides a scaling description of criticality in experimentally interesting three dimensional superlattices as well as in the heizenberg ( isotropic ) and @xmath3 ( easy plane ) universality classes . in the proposed scenario as the scaled temperature @xmath25 , or @xmath26 , decreases , the critical behavior of the superlattice displays the features of the three simpler systems listed above ( fig .",
    "2 ) : first , as @xmath27 is approached , the original superlattice ( ( i ) in fig .",
    "2 ) can be approximated by sequence of thick layers of the first component weakly coupled through the 2-layers ( ( ii ) in fig .",
    "2 ) . at larger values of @xmath28",
    "this coupling can be neglected and the layers display regular bulk critical behavior with the ordinary surface critical behavior at the interfaces .",
    "then , as the correlation length in the first component becomes comparable to the thickness @xmath7 , each slab of the first component exhibits direct bulk - to - film , @xmath29-dimensional crossover",
    ". at still smaller values of @xmath28 , the thickness of these slabs is irrelevant and the system becomes equivalent to the third paradigm mentioned above : a weakly coupled layered system ( ( iii ) in fig .",
    "the reverse , film - to - bulk crossover finally takes the system back to the uniform , bulk @xmath0-dimensional behavior , characterized however by high degree of anisotropy ( ( iv ) in fig .",
    "2 ) . this reentrant crossover behavior leads to dramatic changes in the critical amplitudes , as shown in fig . 3 for the @xmath2-ising class : the critical exponent characterizing divergence of a physical quantity , for which the specific heat per unit volume @xmath30 has been chosen in fig .",
    "3 , changes two times , as @xmath28 goes to zero , between the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 characteristic of the @xmath2 and @xmath33-dimensional critical behavior , respectively . the relative widths @xmath34 ( subscript @xmath35 denotes _ direct _ , bulk - to - film crossover here ) and @xmath36 ( subscript @xmath37 stands for the _ reverse _ , film - to - bulk crossover ) of the temperature domains where the planar ising and the reentrant bulk critical behaviors are observed will be calculated below ; they provide convenient scaling combinations in terms of which a proper description of criticality in superlattices is achieved .",
    "two further points have to be added to this preview of the paper .",
    "first , a crucial element of our qualitative picture is that different layers of the first component remain effectively decoupled while the bulk - to - film crossover ( from ( ii ) to ( iii ) in fig .",
    "2 ) happens _ within _ them .",
    "this turns out to be guarantied by the fact that the subsequent 1-slabs are coupled through the _ surface _ spins whose correlations are much weaker than of those in the bulk .",
    "thus the surface critical behavior , which is not directly seen in temperature dependencies of bulk quantities , like that shown in fig .",
    "3 , appears crucial to the nature of criticality in the superlattice ; we will show that the values of surface critical exponents can thus be extracted from analysis of the dependence of the reentrant width @xmath36 on the thickness of the 2-slabs , @xmath8 .",
    "second , in the case of the @xmath2 ising superlattice the @xmath11-dimensional model , describing a single film of the first component , has a regular finite temperature phase transition .",
    "consequently , in the thick layer limit the critical temperature @xmath6 of the superlattice is only slightly depressed from @xmath27 and the critical fluctuations are essentially localized within the 1-layers . however , in all other cases , i.e. @xmath2 heizenberg and @xmath3-models and all models in @xmath12 , the corresponding @xmath17-dimensional universality classes lack true ferromagnetic long range order at finite temperatures .",
    "the interlayer coupling through the layers of the weaker , second component thus are crucial to existence of long range order . as a result , the critical temperature in these models is strongly shifted towards @xmath18 and the critical domain , in which large scale fluctuations are active , is extended to the temperature range of the order of @xmath38 .    finally , a few remarks about the method of this paper .",
    "we focus here on the @xmath39-component vector spin systems with short range interactions . as usual , ising , @xmath3 , and heizenberg universality classes refer to the @xmath40 , or easy axis , @xmath41 , or easy plane , and @xmath42 , or isotropic , magnets respectively .",
    "the most important omission of this model , apart from restriction to the simplest type of the order parameter , is the absence of long - range dipolar forces ; it seems however natural to make the first step within the simpler realm of local models .",
    "the actual method employed here is to combine the well known linear rg flows at the fixed points representing the three paradigms discussed above ( fig .",
    "2 ) , into the simplest _ global _ rg flow consistent with this linear behavior ( fig .",
    "the resulting scaling theory then passes the test of comparison to the exact results available for the planar ising model .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in the next section we start by taking the conceptually simplest case of the three - dimensional ising superlattice . the renormalization group flow will be proposed and scaling forms derived . in section iii we consider the planar ising case which requires extension of the previous consideration to the case of the zero - temperature critical point describing the @xmath43 dimensional ising model .",
    "the results will then be shown to agree with the exact forms available for this case @xcite .",
    "the extension of the method developed in section iii will be used in the following section , where the heizenberg and the @xmath3 universality classes are considered . the results are summarized in section v.",
    "we start now by focusing on the @xmath2-ising universality class .",
    "its most important feature is that a single thick slab of the first component is fully capable of ordering at a finite temperature @xmath44 , which continuously approaches the bulk transition temperature @xmath27 , as the thickness @xmath45 .",
    "we thus expect that the criticality in a three - dimensional ising superlattice happens close to @xmath27 and that the relevant fluctuations are localized within the 1-slabs .",
    "much of what will be said below will apply however to other systems , so we will keep using general @xmath0 and @xmath11 , as well as the general standard notation for the critical exponents in this section .    the renormalization group procedure which we use here has been extensively discussed in @xcite for the half - infinite models bounded by one free surface , and applied to the superlattice geometry in @xcite .",
    "it is based on subsequent reduction , @xmath46 , of the upper cut - off @xmath47 imposed on the @xmath17-dimensional wave numbers @xmath48 characterizing the spatial variation of fluctuations in the directions parallel to the layers .",
    "since the superlattice geometry is uniform in this plane , expansion in plane waves @xmath49 can be used as a basis for a perturbative rg of the type discussed in @xcite .",
    "the details of the procedure will not be important to us here : all we need is the _ existence _ of an exact rg transformation ; then according to the general principles @xcite the linearized rg flow in the vicinity of the fixed points should be independent of the specific implementation .",
    "note that there is no need to do anything about the cut - off in the @xmath9-direction ( in fact one does not need such cut - off at all ) : elimination of fast modes in the directions parallel to the layers automatically _ induces _ coarse - graining in the @xmath9-direction @xcite .",
    "we will now follow the rg flow probing fluctuations on larger and larger length scales parallel to the layers .",
    "the two crucial length scales , to which the current ( running ) length scale has to be compared , are the _ bulk _ correlation lengths @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which can be ( at least in principle ) measured at the given temperature @xmath52 in independent bulk samples of the two components . near @xmath27 fluctuations in the second component are confined to scales smaller than the bulk correlation length @xmath53 , which remains finite while @xmath54 diverges .",
    "decreasing the upper momentum cutoff to @xmath55 essentially eliminates fluctuations in the 2-layers . on larger scales the 2-layers",
    "are adequately described by the ornstein - zernike spin density functional corresponding to the gaussian rg fixed point describing the low - temperature phase of the second component . as usual ,",
    "gaussian degrees of freedom can be integrated out , the integration being equivalent to minimization of the ornstein - zernike functional .",
    "such minimization is performed in the appendix .",
    "it results in an effective interaction @xcite @xmath56 between the top surface spins @xmath57 of the @xmath39-th layer and the bottom surface spins @xmath58 of the @xmath59-th layer of the first component . at this point",
    "the thickness @xmath8 gets absorbed into the bare coupling constant @xmath60 .",
    "a major simplification has occurred after this initial crossover : the rg flow has taken the original superlattice system to the first fixed point , @xmath61 , equivalent to a sample of the first component containing a periodic sequence of defect ( hyper- ) planes , characterized by very weak vertical bonds @xmath62 ( ( ii ) in fig .",
    "2 ) . note that all physics of the second component , as well as all details of the microscopic implementation of the i interface between the subsequent layers , have been absorbed into two parameters : the directly measurable correlation length @xmath63 and the nonuniversal amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "a necessary condition for the reentrant dimensional crossover , described in the introduction , is the smallness of the initial , bare value of the coupling in the temperature range around @xmath65 : @xmath66\\ll k_bt . \\label{condition1}\\ ] ] under this condition , we can consider the coupling ( [ int ] ) as a weak perturbation with respect to the reference system consisting of _ noninteracting _ layers of the first component . further , for the values of the rg parameter @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , typical fluctuations are correlated only over lengths much shorter than @xmath7 , implying that the top and the bottom surfaces of each 1-layer are uncoupled .",
    "provided the correlation length @xmath54 of the first component has not been encountered yet , the system appears to be at the critical fixed point @xmath69 describing independent bulk critical behavior within the 1-layers coupled to the ordinary surface critical behavior at the noninteracting interfaces .",
    "note that this scenario implies another condition , @xmath70 both conditions , ( [ condition1],[condition2 ] ) , require the layers to be thick . in the case of two different materials , @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 and both inequalities are satisfied as soon as @xmath73 .",
    "the situation becomes less trivial in the case of a superlattice created by a weak periodic modulation of the properties of an originally uniform sample , then one has to be sure that the period of modulation is large enough to offset the smallness of the difference between the bulk curie temperatures implying a relatively large @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the standard correlation length exponent in @xmath0 dimensions .    the crossover is now described as an rg - flow between three critical fixed points ( fig .",
    "4 ) : @xmath69 describing a sequence of uncorrelated _ thick _ layers of the first component ( ( ii ) in fig .",
    "2 ) , with extensive properties dominated by the @xmath0-dimensional bulk critical behavior taking place inside the layers , while the associated ordinary surface scaling describes the observables localized at the surface . from @xmath76",
    "the system flows to @xmath77 describing the @xmath78-dimensional criticality in a system of uncorrelated _ thin _ films of the first component ( ( iii ) in fig .",
    "2 ) , and , finally , to @xmath79 describing uniform @xmath0-dimensional bulk behavior ( ( iv ) in fig .",
    "the flow between the fixed points is driven by two scaling fields ( cf .",
    "4 ) , the inverse thickness of the 1-layers , @xmath80 , playing the role of a long wave length ( infrared ) cutoff in the @xmath9-direction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and the interlayer coupling strength @xmath62 .",
    "yet another one , scaled temperature field @xmath26 controls the departure from the critical manifold , @xmath81 , containing the flow attracted by @xmath79 , towards the massive , high- and low - temperature fixed points . instead of the scaled temperature field",
    "@xmath82 characterizing the bulk criticality of the first component , one can use @xmath25 defined relative to the _ observed _ critical temperature @xmath83 of the superlattice . as we will see below ,",
    "the scaling forms look simpler when expressed via @xmath28 , but lack any information about the _ shift _ in the critical temperature with respect to @xmath27 . in the rg approach",
    "the scaling fields become functions of the logarithmic length scale @xmath67 .",
    "while the explicit calculation of the crossover scaling functions requires application of non - perturbative methods such as the one used in @xcite , the leading singularities are determined by the rg flow in close vicinities of the fixed points .",
    "specifically , at @xmath69 the linearized rg flow equations are @xmath84 here @xmath75 is the standard correlation length exponent of the bulk @xmath0-dimensional universality class .",
    "the second equation ( [ ld ] ) reflects decrease in @xmath7 expressed in units of the running inverse length scale @xmath47 ; the equality of the rg eigenvalue in ( [ ld ] ) to one reflects asymptotic isotropy of the bulk critical behavior described by @xmath69 .",
    "the rg eigenvalue for @xmath62 is read from ( 1 ) . because the spins entering ( 1 ) are located at the surfaces ,",
    "the scaling dimension of the spin density @xmath85 determining the rg eigenvalue of @xmath62 is that characteristic of the _ surface _ spin density .",
    "correspondingly @xmath86 is the exponent characterizing the susceptibility of the _ surface _ spins to a perturbation by a _ surface _",
    "field @xcite .",
    "the crucial point now is that since the surface spins are correlated more weakly than the bulk ones , the surface susceptibility usually does not diverge ( see the estimates of surface critical exponents in @xcite ) : @xmath87 . consequently @xmath62 is irrelevant or marginal at the first encounter with @xmath76 .",
    "thus starting with a small coupling @xmath62 , we are guarantied that it remains small until the system arrives at @xmath77 .",
    "note that this picture implies a seemingly paradoxical prediction : a single layer of weak bonds cutting through a bulk sample effectively decouples the two halves , with two _ independent _ ordinary surface fluctuations developing at the two sides of it .",
    "the two other scaling fields , @xmath82 and @xmath80 are relevant at @xmath69 . as @xmath88 is positive definite , it is convenient to exclude @xmath67 from the equations ( [ td],[ld ] ) , rewriting them as @xmath89 the crossover to the @xmath17-dimensional fixed point @xmath77 occurs when @xmath88 decreases to the order of the microscopic length scale @xmath90 . as a result of this first crossover ( indicated by subscript @xmath35 , for `` direct , '' below )",
    "the scaling field @xmath91 becomes irrelevant and disappears from the consideration , while the other two are renormalized to @xmath92 here the temperature rescaling factor @xmath93 conveniently characterizes the first crossover .",
    "we will reduce the number of nonuniversal parameters by defining @xmath34 not through @xmath90 , but rather through the critical amplitude @xmath94 characterizing the divergence of the bulk correlation length @xmath95 at the low - temperature side of the bulk critical point @xmath27 : @xmath96 in the rg formalism @xcite the correlation length @xmath54 characterizes the crossover from the critical to noncritical rg fixed points at nonzero values of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 determines the width of the temperature domain around @xmath27 in which the dimensional crossover @xmath97 actually occurs : for @xmath98 the @xmath82-field becomes large and drives the system away from the critical manifold before @xmath91 grows large ; as a result the system never reaches @xmath77 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath99 the system arrives at @xmath77 with the values of the two relevant fields estimated by @xmath100 . in the absence of @xmath62 ( which is small at this stage )",
    "@xmath101 completely determines the flow .",
    "the critical separatrix going into @xmath77 corresponds to a certain initial value @xmath102 .",
    "one expects @xmath103 , as finite thickness suppresses ordering .",
    "in fact , due to our definition of @xmath34 via the bulk correlation length @xmath54 , the parameter @xmath104 is universal : criticality in a _",
    "free _ film of the first component of thickness @xmath7 happens at a temperature @xmath105 at which the ratio @xmath106 takes a universal value @xmath107 where the numerical estimate has been obtained by series expansion methods @xcite . expanding around the separatrix one obtains @xmath108 where the prime marks exponents related to the @xmath17-dimensional criticality .",
    "these equations are to be solved with the initial data given by @xmath109 . as a result of the first crossover the surface spins in ( [ int ] ) are strongly correlated with the rest of the corresponding layer , thus becoming @xmath17-dimensional in nature .",
    "correspondingly , the scaling dimension of the spin density @xmath85 in the rg flow equation for @xmath62 is changed from the _ ordinary surface _",
    "value @xmath85 to the @xmath17-dimensional @xmath110 .",
    "correspondingly nonpositive @xmath86 is changed to positive @xmath111 , so that @xmath62 is a relevant perturbation at @xmath77 driving the second crossover back to @xmath76 .",
    "the following analysis of the reverse crossover ( as indicated by subscript @xmath37 below ) essentially repeats the one performed for @xmath97 above : we divide one of the two linear rg equations by another to obtain ( the coupling strength @xmath62 is positive definite ) @xmath112 a nonuniversal amplitude @xmath113 is defined so that at @xmath114 the @xmath17-dimensional hyperplanes become strongly coupled and the system crosses over to the uniform bulk behavior at @xmath79 .",
    "as this happens , @xmath82 is rescaled by the factor @xmath115 , i. e. @xmath116 where ( recall that @xmath87 ) @xmath117 just as previously , for @xmath118 , i. e. @xmath119 , the system flows away from the critical separatrix before the reentrant crossover to @xmath76 can take place . hence @xmath36 measures in units of @xmath120 the width of the temperature domain in which the reentrant scaling can be observed",
    "; in the original units of @xmath82 the width is given then by the product @xmath121 .",
    "within the domain @xmath122 the system flows into the close vicinity of @xmath79 .",
    "the critical separatrix is again defined by a certain ( this time positive : interlayer bonds enhance ordering ) value of @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , as at this point we have no other scale to measure the interlayer coupling amplitude @xmath64 , we can fix the arbitrary constant @xmath124 by setting @xmath125 . having grown to the order of @xmath124 the interlayer coupling amplitude @xmath62 is absorbed into the rescaled value of the temperature field @xmath126 and becomes irrelevant .",
    "the reentrant @xmath79 is a regular critical fixed point with temperature ( in the absence of magnetic field ) being the only relevant perturbation measuring the deviation from the critical separatrix ( fig .",
    "the evolution of the latter is again described by the rg flow equation ( [ td ] ) which has to be solved with the initial condition @xmath127    having established the principle features of the rg flow we are in a position now to develop a scaling description of the observable quantities .",
    "the two temperature scales @xmath34 and @xmath36 defined by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , together with the original value of the scaled temperature of the first component , @xmath82 , conveniently parametrize the scaling functions . if the bulk properties of the two components are known , then the only new nonuniversal parameter appearing in our description of the superlattice is the dimensionless ratio @xmath128 , essentially characterizing the strength of coupling between the spins across the interface between the two components ( see the appendix for more precise definition ) .",
    "the standard two - scale factor universality @xcite of the bulk critical points is thus extended to what may be called @xmath129-factor universality : all scaling functions of a superlattice are universal apart from the two independent bulk critical amplitudes of the first component plus the amplitude @xmath128 characterizing the interface and the bulk correlation length of the second component @xmath130 . in fact , the two additional parameters enter the description via the initial value of the effective coupling @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "thus , if one were not interested in the ( singular ) dependence of the critical behavior of the superlattice on the thickness @xmath8 , only one extra amplitude , @xmath62 , would have to be added to complete the description of critical behavior in a superlattice .",
    "however , since for large @xmath8 the amplitude @xmath62 is going to be anomalously small , and since @xmath8 is easily measured , we prefer to split @xmath62 into the nonsingular amplitude @xmath64 and the singular exponential factor @xmath132 , adding the bulk correlation length @xmath130 to the list of empirical parameters .",
    "we start by analyzing the shift in the critical temperature .",
    "unfolding back the two renormalizations of the temperature field , one obtains from ( [ td],[t1c ] ) @xmath133=t'_c(l_1)+t_{c1}\\tau_d\\tau_r.\\ ] ] the shift consists of a larger , @xmath134 , shift to lower temperatures , slightly corrected by a much smaller , @xmath135 $ ] , shift in the opposite direction .",
    "the last expression represents the latter as a shift with respect to @xmath136 $ ] , the critical temperature in a film of the first component of thickness @xmath7 with free boundaries .",
    "if this latter temperature is known , then the observed shift towards the higher temperatures , @xmath137 , can be used to estimate the unknown amplitude @xmath128 entering the definition of @xmath36 ( [ taur ] ) .",
    "let us consider now an extensive observable , say the specific heat per unit volume @xmath30 characterized by critical exponents @xmath31 and @xmath138 in dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath17 correspondingly .",
    "since the surface - to - volume ratio in a superlattice vanishes as @xmath139 , the observed signal at the first stage of the crossover is dominated by the interior of the 1-layers : as far as extensive properties are concerned @xmath69 is equivalent to @xmath79 and the rg flow is indeed reentrant .",
    "this flow can be represented by the scaling form @xmath140 where @xmath141 are given in ( [ t1d],[t1r ] ) , and @xmath142 is the bulk critical amplitude of the first component on the low - temperature side of the criticality .",
    "the factor @xmath143 represents the amplitude of the contribution to @xmath30 from the interior of the 1-layers at the first stage of the rg flow ( governed by @xmath69 ) below @xmath27 ; the choice of @xmath142 i instead of @xmath144 seems natural in view of @xmath145 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath146 is completely _",
    "universal_. it has the following limits : it approaches 1 at @xmath147 and the universal amplitude ratio @xmath148 at @xmath149 ; at @xmath150 it develops a singularity @xmath151 which cancels the one generated by the @xmath152 factor in ( [ a1 ] ) . at @xmath153 one",
    "has @xmath154 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the new scaling function @xmath155 follows the same logic as the one employed above for @xmath146 : it takes finite limits at @xmath156 , develops a singularity , @xmath157 , when @xmath158 .",
    "as already mentioned above , because in the ising universality class the critical temperature shifts satisfy @xmath159 a simpler scaling form is achieved in terms of the scaled temperature @xmath160 shifted to the _ observed _ critical temperature @xmath161 .",

    "the continuity of @xmath166 requires that both universal amplitude ratios @xmath167 ( remember that the scaling function has been normalized by the bulk amplitude @xmath142 ) are numbers of the order of unity . the last asymptotic expression in ( [ a ] )",
    "shows that while the ultimate divergence @xmath168 is characterized by the bulk exponent @xmath31 , the critical amplitudes @xmath169 are shifted on the logarithmic scale from the bulk amplitudes @xmath170 of the first component by @xmath171 ( see fig.3 ) , i.e. @xmath172+o(1 ) .",

    "the result is : @xmath177 similarly , at @xmath6 , the amplitude of the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath178 at @xmath179 is suppressed compared to that of @xmath180 by an amplitude ratio @xmath181 one thus arrives at the large - scale description of the critical state of the superlattice as a highly anisotropic realization of the bulk universality class of the first component ( ( iv ) in fig .",
    "2 ) . in fact , following the standard ideas of scaling @xcite one can relate all anomalous changes in the critical amplitudes ( [ cratio ] ) , ( [ logcratio ] ) to the anisotropy @xmath182 of the basic length scales .",
    "despite the generality of the above consideration , of all the @xmath183 spin lattice models in three and two dimensions only the @xmath184-superlattice behaves strictly according to this scenario , as the ising model has regular finite - temperature critical fixed points without marginal operators in both @xmath2 and @xmath185 .",

    "more precisely , in the interesting case of a _ thick layer _ superlattice @xcite , criticality happens when the correlation length @xmath54 , characterizing the low - temperature phase of the first component , is much smaller than the width of the 1-layers , @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the rg flow in this case comes to @xmath77 not from @xmath69 , but from the low - temperature fixed point @xmath187 describing the ordered phases of the first component .",
    "nevertheless , many results can be formulated in terms of just one nonuniversal parameter characterizing @xmath187 : the linear energy @xmath188 of a domain wall separating spin - up and spin - down phases of the first component .",
    "let us start our consideration from a close vicinity of @xmath27 , where @xmath189 and the crossover @xmath97 proceeds directly , without encountering @xmath187 .",
    "after leaving @xmath69 the scaled temperature @xmath82 is renormalized to @xmath190 .",
    "since @xmath191 in the planar ising universality class , below but close to @xmath27 one can write @xmath192 ( note that the normalization @xmath193 , making @xmath194 has been adopted in @xcite ) .",
    "further , @xmath195 in this universality class @xcite , so that the coupling @xmath196 is not renormalized near @xmath69 to the linear order in @xmath62 .",
    "while one should expect logarithmic corrections to @xmath62 for this marginal case , those do not seem to affect the essential features of the exact solution . as discussed in @xcite , at @xmath197 @xmath198 the last identity , in which @xmath199 is the linear free energy of a domain wall between the two low - temperature phases of the first component , represents the dimensionless coarse - grained spin - spin coupling @xmath200 of the @xmath24-ising model onto which a strip of the first component is mapped after the direct , bulk - to - film crossover . at @xmath77",
    "this spin - spin coupling transforms according to @xmath201 , or @xmath202 with the critical separatrix corresponding to the extreme value @xmath203 , as implied by @xmath204 in the @xmath43-dimensional ising class . note that the fugacity @xmath205 , taking the initial value @xmath206 , behaves at @xmath77 as a regular thermal scaling field with the rg eigenvalue equal to one .",
    "consequently , the criterion for @xmath77-dominated behavior is @xmath207 , or , equivalently , @xmath208 .",
    "meanwhile , magnetization scales trivially , @xmath209 , at @xmath77 .",
    "thus the eigenvalue of @xmath62 is @xmath210 and the corresponding rg equation at @xmath77 can be rewritten as @xmath211 . dividing one rg equation by another we obtain @xmath212 from which one can construct a renormalized temperature @xmath213 it is convenient to define @xmath124 here in such way that the criticality occurs at @xmath214 . then , in full agreement with @xcite , up to corrections vanishing as @xmath215 , the critical temperature @xmath6 of the superlattice can be obtained from the equation @xmath216 where the last identity defines what may be called the _ scaled thickness _ of the layers .",
    "if this equation is satisfied at @xmath217 , the case called the _ thin layer _",
    "limit in @xcite , then the flow indeed never encounters @xmath187 .",

    "limit @xcite , @xmath220 , however in this case the behavior of the system on length scales between @xmath54 and @xmath7 is governed by the low - temperature , non - critical fixed point @xmath187 .    to describe criticality in this limit we start at scales larger than @xmath50 well below @xmath6 . if the rg is implemented with rescaling the block spin by the factor of the area of the block ( rather than the square root of the area leading to the gaussian fixed point described by the ornstein - zernike functional @xcite ) , then at these scales fluctuations in the amplitude of magnetization are completely suppressed .",
    "the only allowed fluctuations are domain walls separating domains of two different spin orientations . at these scales",
    "the walls look geometrically sharp and are characterized ( neglecting lattice effects ) by a single parameter : free energy per unit length @xmath188 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a single strip of the first component becomes identical to a @xmath24-ising model : spins are fully correlated across the strip ; a domain wall cutting across the strip has finite free energy @xmath221 playing a role of an effective ferromagnetic coupling between neighboring blocks of size @xmath222 .",
    "characterization of the effective @xmath24-model is completed by specifying the value of a block spin , @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the bulk magnetization density in the first component .",
    "the crossover from @xmath77 to @xmath79 proceeds exactly as described in the beginning of this section , because the representation ( [ xi - sigma ] ) of @xmath120 via the linear surface energy @xmath188 is valid independently of whether the system has arrived at @xmath77 from @xmath69 or from @xmath187 .",
    "after the reverse crossover the thermal field is renormalized to @xmath225 leading to the universal relation for the critical temperature @xmath226 holding up to corrections of order @xmath227 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath228 used in ( [ xi - sigma ] ) is valid in the planar ising universality class up to corrections of order @xmath229 , which were neglected in the field - theoretical description of ref.@xcite .",
    "the expression ( [ tc2d ] ) however has a much wider range of validity : it requires only that the strips are thick , with no condition on the values of the correlation lengths in the two components .    for an extensive observable like the specific heat per unit area we can write now @xmath230 here the exponent @xmath231 , equal to @xmath232 in the case of the specific heat , and the critical amplitude @xmath233 characterize singularity @xmath234 in the one - dimensional regime .",
    "the scaling function @xmath164 has the following limits : it approaches 1 at @xmath235 ; diverges as @xmath236 at @xmath237 with the amplitude ratios @xmath238 being universal ; an exponential singularity @xmath239 cancels the singular prefactor in ( [ 2dising ] ) at @xmath240 .",
    "the critical divergence of the specific heat , @xmath241 is characterized by the amplitude @xmath242 where we have taken into account that @xmath243 cancels the @xmath244 prefactor in ( [ c2dfull ] ) .    in order to complete the estimate of @xmath245 we have to know the amplitude @xmath246 .",
    "the one - dimensional amplitudes of extensive observables ( per unit _ length _ of a layer ) can be generated from the well - known expression for the free energy density @xmath247 of a one - dimensional chain at temperature @xmath52 and magnetic field @xmath248 ( see @xcite and references there ) @xmath249 where we have taken into account that @xmath54 plays the role of the effective cutoff for the one - dimensional behavior along the layers , and both @xmath54 and @xmath250 are taken at @xmath251 . differentiating with respect to the temperature @xmath52 we obtain ( at @xmath251 and @xmath252 ) @xmath253 .",
    "combined with ( [ a2d-1 ] ) this gives @xmath254 this agrees fully with the result of @xcite .",
    "other amplitudes can be similarly estimated and agree with the exact solution .",
    "an interesting feature of the form ( [ 2dising ] ) is that below @xmath6 , at @xmath255 the exponential part of the scaling function @xmath164 compensating for the ( now spurious ) singular prefactor , leads to @xmath256 this can now be recognized as pointing to the dominance of the fluctuations in the _ second _ component as @xmath18 is approached : in fact , due to the self duality of the planar ising model , a completely similar construction can be developed starting from low - temperatures and focusing on the dual variables in the 2-layers .",
    "both scenarios lead to essentially the same results .",
    "the other @xmath183 models can be analyzed similarly ; only the most interesting results will be briefly discussed below .",
    "the case of the three - dimensional heizenberg ( @xmath42 ) model is very close to the planar ising one , as the @xmath257-class is believed to be characterized by a zero - temperature critical point with the effective coupling being marginally relevant @xcite .",
    "this effective coupling in a single heizenberg film of the first component is the dimensionless _",
    "helicity modulus _",
    "@xcite @xmath258 . in the low - temperature phase of the @xmath2-heizenberg model",
    "the helicity modulus @xmath259 has the dimension of inverse length , effectively defining the correlation length @xmath260 . in the thick layer limit the critical temperature @xmath6 of the superlattice",
    "is again shifted well below @xmath27 of the first component . thus on scales smaller than @xmath7 the first component is well ordered and the additive approximation @xmath261 is well justified @xcite",
    ". here @xmath259 can be ( at least in principle ) measured independently in a bulk sample of the first component .",
    "once the direct crossover to @xmath77 has occurred , one can form @xmath262 and use the well known @xmath12-heizenberg model rg equation @xcite @xmath263 while the coupling @xmath62 is trivially additive @xmath264 with @xmath185 here . combining these two equations",
    "we obtain , in complete analogy with ( [ tc2d ] ) , a universal expression satisfied at the critical point of a heizenberg superlattice : @xmath265 quite analogously to the consideration given above for the planar ising case one arrives at the picture of the critical temperature shift @xmath266 , large scale fluctuations between in the wide temperature range between @xmath27 and @xmath18 , and exponential dependence of critical amplitudes on the thickness of the layers .",
    "the case of a @xmath3 ( @xmath41 ) superlattice in @xmath2 is special because , on one hand , the @xmath185-class is characterized by a finite - temperature kosterlitz - thouless transition , so that we expect the shift in the critical temperature to vanish in the limit of ( atomically ) thick layers . on the other hand ,",
    "the spontaneous magnetization is zero in @xmath185 at any finite temperature .",
    "thus the coupling @xmath62 through the 2-layers is crucial in supporting long - range order in a three - dimensional superlattice and we expect the observed spontaneous magnetization to be anomalously suppressed when @xmath196 is small , even well below @xmath267 .",
    "the suppression is easily estimated by combining the rg equation for the order parameter @xmath268 , where the scaling dimension @xcite @xmath269 with the additive growth of @xmath62 given by ( [ additive ] ) ; note that in the case of a superfluid the helicity modulus @xmath270 is proportional to the superfluid density @xmath271 .",
    "the result is @xmath272 note that @xmath273 essentially plays the role of @xmath54 in this universality class , as well .",
    "one can thus see that in the case of @xmath274 , spontaneous magnetization of a superlattice decreases exponentially as soon as @xmath54 exceeds @xmath63 , long before @xmath54 becomes comparable to the thickness @xmath7",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this behavior could be observed at a superfluid transition of liquid helium-4 in some matrix with periodically modulated properties .",
    "similarly , a @xmath275 superlattice may be realized in a helium film deposited on a periodically modulated substrate ( the latter could be itself cut out of a _ solid _ three - dimensional superlattice ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath43 @xmath3-model orders only at @xmath276 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath6 of the superlattice to be shifted well below @xmath27 . at such temperatures the 1-layers are equivalent to a sequence of one - dimensional ( classical ) @xmath3-chains , described by the gaussian",
    "hamiltonians @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the phase of the @xmath3 order parameter , @xmath20 labels the layers .",
    "the effective one - dimensional helicity modulus @xmath279 is given by the product @xmath280 , as in all other cases considered in this section .",
    "each pair of neighboring layers is coupled through the 2-layers separating them via @xmath281 combining the flow of the one - dimensional gaussian coupling @xmath282 with the ubiquitous ( [ additive ] ) ( @xmath43 here ) we arrive at the condition of criticality @xmath283 , which with logarithmic accuracy can be rewritten as @xmath284 a little thinking shows that for @xmath274 the critical temperature of the superlattice is in fact shifted closer to the _ lower _ of the critical temperatures of the two components ; it stays however sufficiently above @xmath18 so that @xmath63 remains much smaller than @xmath8 and our focusing on fluctuations in the 1-layers remains well justified .",
    "in summary , this paper addresses the following , as yet hypothetical , experimental project : a sequence of superlattices is built of the same two ferromagnetic components , but with different basic thicknesses @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "the bulk critical properties of the components are assumed to be well known , the thicknesses @xmath285 , i.e. large compared to any important microscopic length of the two materials , and no long - range dipolar interaction is present . given the well developed theory of critical phenomena in the ising , @xmath3 , and heizenberg universality classes , can one predict the variation of the critical properties of the superlattices with the changes in @xmath7 and @xmath8 ?    naively one may expect that in the limit of @xmath286 all extensive properties of the superlattice can be expressed as a weighted average of the _ bulk _ densities of the components . indeed , if the limit of infinite thicknesses is taken at _ fixed temperature _",
    "@xmath287 , surface corrections to the bulk density average vanish as @xmath288 , where the correlation lengths @xmath289 play the role of _ penetration depths _ for the perturbations induced by an interface in the two adjacent layers .",
    "however , experiment on a given sample studies the @xmath290 limit at _ fixed thicknesses _",
    "@xmath291 , so that the correlation length(s ) are bound to exceed the period of the superlattice making the surface contributions crucial .",
    "the thick layer limit for the critical properties of a superlattice is _ singular _ , the thicknesses @xmath292 have to be combined with certain functions of the temperature to form proper scaling fields in terms of which a consistent scaling description is achieved .",
    "such scaling description has been constructed above based on the qualitative picture of reentrant dimensional crossover @xcite . in this picture",
    "2 ) a superlattice , at its critical temperature @xmath6 , displays three different asymptotic types of critical behavior , when probed on different length scales",
    ". these three asymptotic models are , in the order of increasing wave length , ( ii ) a sequence of noninteracting semi - bulk samples , exhibiting _",
    "ordinary _ surface critical behavior at the surfaces ; ( iii ) a sequence of noninteracting _ thin _ layers , exhibiting @xmath11-dimensional behavior ; ( iv ) a highly anisotropic , but uniform critical system of the same universality class as that of the components .",
    "away from @xmath6 the finite correlation length falls into one of the three regimes , so that instead of probing different length scales at @xmath6 one can study the crossover by observing the asymptotic behavior at different temperatures approaching @xmath6 .",
    "each of these limiting types of behavior corresponds to a previously studied renormalization group fixed point . combining those into a global rg flow ( fig .",
    "4 ) we have constructed a rather complete scaling picture of critical phenomena in superlattices composed of thick layers of two components .",
    "the simplest case is that of a @xmath2-ising superlattice , characterized by the possibility of a finite - temperature phase transition in a single layer of the first component . as a result , in the limit of thick layers",
    "the critical temperature @xmath6 of the superlattice approaches that of the stronger of the two ferromagnets , @xmath27 .",
    "the two crossovers then happen in a ( relatively ) narrow vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "they are conveniently characterized in terms of the reduced temperature scales @xmath293 given by ( [ taud ] ) , ( [ taur ] ) .",
    "these scales represent ( fig .",
    "3 ) the relative widths of the temperature domains in which the superlattice behaves , respectively , as models ( ii ) and ( iii ) above .",
    "the simplest scaling description ( [ a ] ) is then achieved in terms of the reduced temperatures @xmath294 and @xmath295 , shifted to the observed critical temperature @xmath6 . as represented graphically in the double logarithmic plot of fig .",
    "3 , the ultimate divergence is characterized by the critical exponents characteristic of the bulk , @xmath0-dimensional behavior",
    ". however the presence of the intermediate domain of the @xmath17-dimensional behavior ( model ( ii ) ) leads to anomalous changes in the critical amplitudes , as seen in ( fig .",
    "3 ) and expressed analytically through ( [ taud],[taur ] ) in ( [ logcratio ] ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat more interesting in the other three- and two - dimensional spin - vector universality classes , where the weak bonds between subsequent 1-layers play a crucial role in maintaining the magnetic long - range order in the system .",
    "this leads to a large shift in the critical temperature of a superlattice , as implicitly given for various classes by the universal expressions ( [ tc2d],[tch3d ] , [ tcxy2d ] ) , as well as the anomalous , exponential suppression in the amplitude of spontaneous magnetization ( [ mxy3d ] ) in a three - dimensional @xmath3-superlattice .",
    "where applicable , the results obtained here by the method of this paper agree with the analysis of the exact solution for the two - dimensional ising superlattice @xcite given in @xcite . the three - peaked form of the temperature dependence of the specific heat , characteristic of that model generalizes to the three - dimensional heizenberg class .",
    "it has a transparent physical interpretation : most of the spin degrees of freedom in such a superlattice get ordered at one of the bulk critical temperatures of the two components , leading to finite , but large - amplitude peaks at both .",
    "however , a small , @xmath296 , fraction of the degrees of freedom participate in strong large - scale fluctuations at all @xmath297 , giving small - amplitude , but diverging contribution to the specific heat at @xmath6 .",
    "the abundance of interfaces in a three dimensional magnetic superlattice may greatly improve chances of experimental observation of surface and two - dimensional scaling .",
    "in particular , the elusive surface scaling exponents enter the definition of the parameter @xmath36 in ( [ taur ] ) and can be obtained , for instance , by analyzing the dependence of the critical amplitudes , ( [ logcratio ] ) and fig . 3 , on the thickness of 1-layers @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the main restriction of the present analysis seems to be the neglect of dipolar interactions .",
    "when present , these interactions will lead to demagnetization effects making heizenberg universality class asymptotically unstable . otherwise ,",
    "most of the results presented above can be easily modified in the case when the interlayer interaction dependence on the thickness of the separating layers , @xmath298 , is a power - law rather than an exponential as was always assumed above . however , the assumption of local interactions enters our consideration in much deeper ways than just through the exponential form of @xmath298 , so that the required revision could be much more serious . _",
    "anti_-ferromagnets , of course , are free from the complications arising from the dipolar interactions .",
    "however , pinning of the spin density waves by the interfaces between the layers in a superlattice gives rise to a different source of the thickness dependent effects beyond the scope of this paper . in any case",
    ", the above consideration seems to represent a reasonable first step towards a complete analysis of scaling in superlattices .",
    "note that recently critical phenomena in superlattices have been analyzed in the frames of the mean - field landau - ginzburg approximation @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of our results to theirs is hardly feasible in view of the failure of the mean - filed approximation @xmath12 and 3 considered here .",
    "however a combination of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with a renormalization group expansion in @xmath299 and the scaling framework developed above looks promising , although computationally very hard , direction for future work .",
