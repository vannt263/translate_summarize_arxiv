    "continuous state differential equations are a popular modeling choice for the chemical concentrations of biochemical reaction networks in several disciplines , including industrial chemistry and systems biology .",
    "however , differential equations should only be used to model chemical concentrations when the counts of the reactant species are high @xcite . when the multiplicity of the individual species is low , as is often the case in enzymatic and genetic systems , it is important to use a model with a discrete state space which tracks individual molecular counts .",
    "predictions pertaining to the long - term behavior of a particular system can change dramatically depending upon whether the system is modeled with differential equations or with a discrete state space .",
    "in particular , discrete - space models may exhibit an extinction event where none exists in the corresponding continuous state model .",
    "for example , consider the following chemical reaction network :    ( c1 ) @xmath0 ; ( c2 ) @xmath1 ; ( c3 ) @xmath2 ; ( c1 ) edge node [ above left = -0.15 cm ] @xmath3 ( c2 ) ; ( c2 ) edge node [ below right = -0.15 cm ] @xmath4 ( c1 ) ; ( c2 ) edge node [ above = -0.15 cm ] @xmath5 ( c3 ) ;    where the labels correspond to the enumeration of the reactions .",
    "the deterministic mass action model predicts an asymptotically stable steady state for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "however , for the discrete - space model with stochastic mass - action kinetics and @xmath6 , the state @xmath7 is the inevitable absorbing state regardless of parameter values .",
    "this extinction event can be achieved by reaction 3 occurring until the count of species @xmath8 is zero , at which point no further reactions may occur .",
    "several frameworks exist for tracking trajectories of discrete state chemical reaction systems , including those of continuous time markov chains @xcite and stochastic petri nets @xcite . in these settings ,",
    "the admissible transitions between states are assumed to occur randomly at a known rate and the occurrence of each reaction instantaneously updates the system according to the stoichiometry of the associated reaction .",
    "analysis of such systems is typically conducted by generating sample trajectories ( through a stochastic simulation algorithm , e.g. _",
    "gillespie s algorithm _",
    "@xcite or the next reaction method @xcite ) , by analyzing the evolution of the probability distribution via kolmogorov s forward equations ( i.e.  the _ chemical master equation _ ) , by characterizing the stationary distributions of the models @xcite , or by studying the stochastic equations for the model @xcite .",

    "brijder utilized tools from petri net theory to further extend the scope of networks known to have extinction behavior , by relating a kernel condition introduced in @xcite to the @xmath9-invariants of the corresponding petri net .",

    ", we further develop a network - based approach to determining when discrete - space chemical reaction systems may exhibit an extinction event .",
    "our main results , theorem [ mainresult ] and corollary [ maincorollary ] , state that a chemical reaction network with a discrete state space exhibits an extinction event if there is a modified network , called the domination - expanded reaction network , on which a particular set of inequalities on the edges _ can not _ be satisfied .",
    "the conditions we present may be summarized as systems of equalities and inequalities and , like corollary 2 of @xcite , suggests computational implementation .",
