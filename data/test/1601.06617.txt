    "in spite of its tremendous success , quantum mechanics still generates many discussions related to its possible limits . in this paper",
    "we present an experimental test for one of the most debated items in quantum theory , namley the `` measurement problem '' , within the spontaneous collapse of the wave function model .",
    "the recent development of testable , mathematically complete and consistent models , the dynamical reduction models , as a possible solution of the `` measurement problem '' , strongly renewed the interest of the scientific community in the foundations of quantum mechanics . the first consistent and satisfying dynamical reduction model , known as quantum mechanics with spontaneous localisation ( qmsl ) , was developed by ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite .",
    "according to this model , particles undergo spontaneous localisations around definite positions , following a possion distribution characterised by a mean frequency @xmath0 s@xmath1 .",
    "the efforts of ghirardi , rimini , weber and pearle @xcite brought to the development of the csl model ( continuous spontaneous localisation ) , based on the introduction of new , non linear and stochastic terms in the schrdinger equation , besides the standard ones . such terms induce , for the state vector , a diffusion process , which is responsible for the wave packet reduction .",
    "the dynamical reduction models posses the characteristic of being experimentally testable by measuring the predicted deviations with respect to standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the conventional approach to test the collapse models is to generate spatial superpositions of mesoscopic systems and examine the loss of interference , while environmental noises are under control .",
    "naturally oscillating systems , such as neutrinos , neutral mesons and chiral molecules , create quantum superpositions and thus represent , as well , a natural case - study for testing the quantum linearity .",
    "however , the collapse models can not be tested with neutrinos and the effect , stronger for neutral mesons , is still beyond experimental reach , while chiral molecules can offer valid candidates for testing collapse models @xcite .",
    "the most promising testing ground is offered by the spontaneous emission of radiation due to the particle interaction with the stochastic field which causes an enhancement of the energy expectation value .",
    "this implies , for a free charged particle , the emission of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "such a spontaneous radiation is not present in the standard quantum mechanics .",
    "a measurement of the emitted radiation rate thus makes it possible to obtain valuable information on the @xmath2 parameter of the collapse models .",
    "q. fu @xcite obtained , for the first time , an upper limit for @xmath2 based on this effect , using the radiation measured by a system of germanium detectors@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a more refined analysis of the x - ray emission spectrum measured by the igex collaboration @xcite and improve the previous limit on @xmath2 by a factor about 4 .",
    "we will conclude the paper by presenting some ideas to perform in the near future a dedicated measurement and to gain more than one order of magnitude in the limit of the @xmath2-parameter .",
    "part of the interest of the scientific community for the dynamical reduction models as a possible solution to the `` measurement problem '' stands in their characteristic to be experimentally testable .",
    "the stochastic field which is responsible for the reduction of the wave packet , as shown in @xcite , also causes an enhancement of the energy expectation value , which , for the charged particles , means an emission of electromagnetic radiation ( called spontaneous radiation ) not present in the standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the rate of this emitted radiation depends on the parameter @xmath2 characterizing the collapse models .",
    "consequently , an upper limit for the mean collapse frequency @xmath2 can be established by the measurement of the emitted radiation rate .",
    "the rate of the radiation spontaneously emitted by free electrons , as a consequence of their interaction with the stochastic field , was calculated in the framework of the non - relativistic csl model , assuming that @xmath2 is an universal parameter , not depending on the particle mass , and it is given by @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 represents the electron mass , @xmath5 is the energy of the emitted photon , @xmath2 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the reduction rate parameter and the correlation length of the reduction model .",
    "the @xmath6 parameter value is taken to be @xmath7 . using the measured radiation rate obtained for an isolated germanium detector @xcite fu extracted the following upper limit for @xmath2 :    @xmath8",
    "if the stochastic field is assumed to be coupled to the particle mass density ( mass proportional csl model ) ( see for example @xcite ) then the previous expression for the emission rate eqn .",
    "( [ furate ] ) for electrons needs to be multiplied by the factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the nucleon mass .",
    "only the four valence electrons were considered to contribute to the measured x - ray emission , as their binding energy is much lower than the emitted photons energy , so they can be considered as _ quasi - free_.    in ref",
    ". @xcite the author argues that , in evaluating this numerical result , fu uses for the electron charge the value @xmath11 , whereas the standard adopted feynman rules require the identification of @xmath12 .",
    "we took into account this correction when evaluating the new limit on the collapse rate parameter presented below .",
    "in order to reduce the possible bias on the @xmath2 value introduced by the evaluation of the rate at one single energy bin , we adopted a different strategy with respect to the analysis performed in @xcite . the x - ray emission spectrum measured by the igex collaboration @xcite",
    "was fitted in an energy range @xmath13 @xmath14 kev @xmath15 , compatible with the non - relativistic assumption ( for electrons ) used in the calculation of the predicted rate ( eqn .",
    "( [ furate ] ) ) .",
    "igex is a low - background experiment dedicated to the double beta neutrinoless ( @xmath16 ) decay research based on the use of low - activity germanium detectors .",
    "the published data @xcite , used to extract a new upper limit on the collapse rate parameter , refers to an 80 kg day exposure .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was then fitted with the following function :    @xmath17    a @xmath18 function was obtained in which the expectation value , for the observed number of counts , bin by bin , follows a gamma distribution , as derived from the bayes theorem .",
    "the @xmath18 function was then minimized , from where we extracted a new value for the @xmath2 parameter , as reported below .",
    "[ fit results ] the result of the fit performed on the igex data is shown in figure [ fit ] .",
    "the minimization gives for the free parameter of the fit the value @xmath19 , corresponding to a reduced chi - square @xmath20 .    )",
    ".,height=384 ]    an upper limit on the @xmath2 parameter can then be set according to eqn .",
    "( [ furate ] ) :    @xmath21    where the @xmath22 factor is given by :    @xmath23    the first bracket accounts for the particle density of germanium , the second term is the number of seconds in one day , and the number 4 represents the valence electrons in germanium .",
    "consistent with fu s hypothesis , considering the four valence electrons to be quasi - free , applying eqn .",
    "( [ fu1 ] ) and using the correct prescription @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) , the following upper limit for the reduction rate parameter was obtained if the stochastic field is assumed to have an universal coupling with all types of particles :    @xmath24    if we take into consideration the possible dependence of @xmath2 on the particle mass , for a mass proportional csl model , then    @xmath25    the obtained limits improve the previous ones @xcite by a factor 4 .",
    "these limits are to be compared with the values originally assumed in @xcite :    @xmath26    and with those proposed , more recently , by s. adler @xcite , where @xmath2 can be as high as @xmath27 . in the coming years",
    "a considerable effort will be dedicated to further improve the limits on the @xmath2 parameter and to perform a more stringent test of the collapse models .",
    "the collapse of the wave function and , more generally , the `` measurement problem '' is one of the hottest topics in quantum mechanics , generating intensive debates and discussions .",
    "a possible mechanism inducing the collapse is the so - called continuous spontaneous localisation ( csl ) , which has an unique experimental signature : a spontaneous radiation emitted by ( free ) charged particles . a new limit on the mean collapse frequency parameter @xmath2 , characterising the csl model ,",
    "was obtained by performing an analyses of the igex experimental data .",
    "the @xmath2 value was obtained to be @xmath28 if no mass dependence is considered , and @xmath29 if , instead , such a dependence is taken into consideration .",
    "we are presently performing a feasibility study to define a dedicated experimental setup which will allow us in the future to improve the limits on the collapse rate parameter @xmath2 by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "we will then impose very strong constraints on the possible csl models , being able to exclude those with the @xmath2-parameter higher than the experimental limit . if",
    ", instead , the rate of the emitted radiation , contrary to the expectations , will not go down below a certain limit , this would pose a very interesting problem to the scientific community .",
