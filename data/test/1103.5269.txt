    "reaching agreement without global coordination is of fundamental interest in large - scale autonomous multi - agent systems . in the context of social systems , the objective is to understand and predict the emergence of large - scale population - level patterns arising from empirically supported local interaction rules between individuals ( e.g. , humans ) .",
    "examples for such phenomena driven by social dynamics include the emergence and the evolution of languages @xcite or opinion formation @xcite .    the creation of shared classification schemes in a system of artificial and networked autonomous agents can also be relevant from a system - design viewpoint , e.g. , for sensor networks @xcite .",
    "envision a scenario where mobile or static sensor nodes are deployed in a large spatially - extended region and the environment is unknown , possibly hostile , the tasks are unforeseeable , and the sensor nodes have no prior classification scheme / language to communicate regarding detecting and sensing objects . since subsequent efficient operation of the sensor network inherently relies on unique object identification , the autonomous development of a common  language \" for all nodes is crucial at the exploration stage after network deployment .    to this end , in this paper we consider and slightly modify a simple set of rules , referred to as language or naming games ( ng ) , originally proposed in the context of semiotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "such problems have become of technological interest to study how artificial agents or robots can invent common classification or tagging schemes from scratch without human intervention @xcite .",
    "the original model @xcite was constructed to account for the emergence of shared vocabularies or conventions in a community of interacting agents .",
    "more recently , a simplified version of the ng was proposed and studied on various network topologies by baronchelli et al .",
    "@xcite , and by dallasta et al .",
    "@xcite the advantage of studying a minimal model is that one can gain a deeper understanding of the spontaneous self - organization process of networked autonomous agents in the context of reaching global agreement , and can extract quantitative scaling properties for systems with a large number of agents .    in the context of artificial agents ,",
    "there are other possible scenarios when the ng algorithm , in addition to being interesting in its own merit in studying agreement dynamics on various networks , can also be particularly useful from a system - design viewpoint",
    ". that can be the case when one does not intend the outcome of the agreement process among many agents to be easily predictable .",
    "the actual process of electing a  leader \" or coordinator among sensor nodes may actually be such a scenario .",
    "the leader must typically be a trusted node , with possible responsibilities ranging from routing coordination to key distribution @xcite .",
    "standard leader election ( le ) algorithms @xcite are essentially based on finding global extremum ( e.g. , maximum ) through local communications @xcite .",
    "thus , the elections can be stolen by placing a node in the network with a sufficiently high i d ( e.g. , the largest number allowed by the number representation scheme of the sensor chips . ) along these lines , a possible application of the ng algorithm is autonomous key creation or selection for encrypted communication in a community of sensor nodes . instead of having a centralized or hierarchial key management system with domain and area key distributors @xcite , group of sensor nodes can elect a key distributor or a security key for secure communications between group members .",
    "this work is an expanded version of our preliminary results @xcite .",
    "in addition to showing more detailed and extended simulation results , we also study and analyze different aspects of the behavior of the model , in particular , the probability distribution of the agreement times and the cluster - size distribution in the ng on random geometrical graphs ( rggs ) .",
    "further , we construct and present finite - size scaling for the agreement times in small - world @xcite ( sw)-connected rggs .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review recent results on the ng on various regular and complex networks . in sec .",
    "iii we define and present results on the ng with _ local broadcast _ on rggs , motivated by communication protocols in sensor networks . in sec .",
    "iv we present and discuss results on the ng on sw - connected rggs .",
    "section v concludes our paper with a brief summary and outlook .",
    "in the simplified version of the ng , agents perform _ pairwise _ games in order to reach agreement on the name to assign to a _ single _ object .",
    "this version of the ng was investigated on fully - connected ( fc ) ( also referred to as mean - field or homogeneous mixing ) @xcite , on regular @xcite , on small - world ( sw ) @xcite , and on scale - free networks @xcite . in the fc network , each agent has a chance to meet with all others and compare their current local vocabularies ( list of  synonyms \" ) before updating them . on regular networks ,",
    "agents have only a limited and fixed number of neighbors on a one- , two- , etc . , dimensional grid with whom they can interact / communicate .",
    "the communication in both cases is  local \" , in that _ pairs of agents _ are selected to interact and to update their vocabularies .",
    "the basic algorithmic rules of the ng are as follows @xcite .",
    "a pair of neighboring nodes ( as defined by the underlying communication topology ) , a  speaker \" and a  listener \" , are chosen at random @xcite .",
    "the speaker will transmit a word from her list of synonyms to the listener .",
    "if the listener has this word , the communication is termed  successful \" , and both players delete all other words , i.e. , collapse their list of synonyms to this one word .",
    "if the listener does not have the word transmitted by the speaker , she adds it to her list of synonyms without any deletion .    among the above rules , the restriction to a single object @xcite strongly reduces the complexity of the model , compared to a more general case where the naming process of multiple objects can be performed simultaneously . from a linguistic viewpoint ,",
    "this rather strong restriction is equivalent to preventing homonymy , and instead , treating all objects independently .",
    "this strong assumption can be more realistic for a system of artificial agents , where agents assign random numbers ( e.g. , chosen from @xmath0 integers ) as  words \" to new objects . in this case",
    ", the number of potential words can be far grater than the number of objects , and the probability that two players invent the same word for different objects ( hence giving rise to homonymy ) is negligible .",
    "it was found that employing the above local rules ( _ pair - wise _ interactions ) , after some time , the agents vocabularies converge to a unique vocabulary shared among all agents @xcite .",
    "the major differences between the ng on fc graphs and on regular low - dimensional grids arise in the scaling of the the memory needed to develop the common language before convergence occurs , and in the scaling of the time @xmath1 needed to reach global agreement .",
    "( the memory need in the present context is the typical value of the largest number of words an agent may posses throughout the evolution of the game @xcite . ) in the fc network , the convergence process to global agreement is fast [ @xmath2 for @xmath3 agents ] , but large memory [ @xmath4 is needed per agent @xcite . for a regular two - dimensional network ( or grid ) , spontaneous evolution toward a shared dictionary is slow [ @xmath5 , but the memory requirement per agent is much less severe [ @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "when the ng is implemented on watts - strogatz @xcite sw networks , the agreement dynamics performs optimally in the sense that the memory needed is small , while the convergence process is much faster than on the regular networks [ @xmath7 , closer to that of the fc network ] @xcite .",
    "sensor networks , which are motivating our study , are both spatial and random . as a large number of sensor nodes",
    "are deployed , e.g. , from vehicles or aircrafts , they are essentially scattered randomly across large spatially - extended regions . in the corresponding abstract graph ,",
    "two nodes are connected if they mutually fall within each others transmission range , depending on the emitting power , the attenuation function and the required minimum signal to noise ratio . random geometric graphs ( rggs ) , also referred to as spatial poisson / boolean graphs , capturing the above scenario , are a common and well established starting point to study the structural properties of sensor network , directly related to coverage , connectivity , and interference .",
    "further , most structural properties of these networks are discussed in the literature in the context of continuum percolation @xcite .",
    "the common design challenge of these networks is to find the optimal connectivity for the nodes : if the connectivity of the nodes is too low , the coverage is poor and sporadic",
    ". if the node connectivity is too high , interference effects will dominate and result in degraded signal reception @xcite . from a topological viewpoint , these networks are , hence , designed to  live \" somewhere above the percolation threshold .",
    "this can be achieved by adjusting the density of sensor nodes and controlling the emitting power of the nodes ; various power - control schemes have been studied along these lines @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider rggs in two - dimensions above the percolation threshold , as minimal models for the underlying network communication topology .",
    "further , we consider rggs with an added small density of  random \" long - range links .",
    "the resulting structure resembles small - world ( sw ) networks @xcite , also well studied in the context of artificial @xcite and social systems @xcite.the focus of this work is to study the ng algorithm on these spatially - embedded random graphs .",
    "as mentioned above in the introduction , first we consider random geometric graphs in two dimensions @xcite as the simplest topological structures capturing the essential features of ad hoc sensor networks .",
    "@xmath3 nodes are uniformly random distributed in an @xmath8@xmath9@xmath8 spatial area . for simplicity",
    "we consider identical radio range @xmath10 for all nodes .",
    "two nodes are connected if they fall within each other s range .",
    "an important parameter in the resulting random geometric graph is the average degree @xmath11 ( defined as the average number of neighbors per node ) , @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total number of links and @xmath3 is the number of nodes . in random geometrical networks",
    ", there is a critical value of the average degree , @xmath15 , above which the largest connected component of the network becomes proportional to the total number of nodes ( the emergence of the giant component ) @xcite . for two - dimensional rggs @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "there is a simple relationship between the average degree @xmath11 , the density of nodes @xmath18@xmath12@xmath19 , and the radio range @xmath10 of the nodes @xcite , @xmath20 , which can be used to control the connectivity ( average degree ) of the network .",
    "we consider the naming game on random geometrical graphs . in the original context of the ng",
    ", agents try to reach agreement in finding a unique  word \" for an object observed by them . in one of the above proposed potential applications ,",
    "agents try to generate a shared unique key for encrypted communication . for simplicity",
    ", we will use the term ",
    "word \" for the latter as well when describing the algorithm .",
    "motivated by communication protocols employed by sensor nodes , we modify the communication rules to make them applicable for sensor networks . instead of pairwise communications",
    ", nodes will initiate _ broadcast _ ( to all neighbors ) in a continuous - time asynchronous fashion . in this paper",
    "we consider the initial condition when the  vocabulary \" of each node is empty . at every elementary time step , a node",
    "is chosen randomly out of @xmath3 nodes ( mimicking poisson asynchrony for large @xmath3 ) .",
    "this node ( the  speaker \" ) will broadcast a word from her list of  synonyms \" ; if her list of synonyms is empty , the speaker randomly invents a word ; if she already has several synonyms , it randomly chooses one .",
    "her neighbors ( the  listeners \" ) compare their vocabularies with the word transmitted by the speaker .",
    "if a listener has this word , she considers the communication a success , and she deletes all other words , collapsing her list of synonyms to this one word .",
    "if a listener does not have the word transmitted by the speaker , she adds it to her list of synonyms without any deletion .",
    "if _ at least one _ listener had the word transmitted , the speaker considers it ( at least a partial ) success , and ( somewhat optimistically ) collapses her list of synonyms to this one word . at every step ,",
    "the  success \" rate @xmath21 is defined as the fraction of listeners who were successful ( i.e. , those that had the word transmitted by the speaker ) . from the above it",
    "is clear that one of the successful listeners , if any , has to report the outcome of the  word matching \" to the speaker . in order to achieve that efficiently ,",
    "in real sensor - network implementations one can employ the  lecture hall \" algorithm @xcite . in this paper time @xmath22",
    "is given in units of one  speaker \"- initiated broadcast _ per node_. the main difference between the above algorithm and the one in refs .",
    "@xcite is the _ broadcast _ ( instead of pairwise communications ) and the underlying network ( rgg in this paper ) to capture the essential features of the ng in sensor networks .    when starting from empty vocabularies , agents invent words randomly .",
    "after time of @xmath23 [ on average one speaker - initiated broadcast per node ] , @xmath24 different words have been created .",
    "following the early - time increase of the number of different words @xmath25 , through local broadcasts , agents slowly reconcile their  differences \" , and eventually will all share the same word .",
    "first , a large number of small spatial clusters sharing the same word develop . by virtue of the slow coalescence of the interfaces separating the clusters , more and more of the small clusters are being eliminated , giving rise to the emergence of larger clusters , eventually leading to one cluster in which all nodes are sharing the same word .",
    "as suggested by baronchelli et al .",
    "@xcite , this late - time process is analogous to coarsening , a well - known phenomenon from the theory of domain and phase ordering in physical and chemical systems @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig.snapshots ] shows snapshots of vocabularies of the nodes at different times . for later times , group of nodes which already share the same word , slowly coarsen , until eventually only one domain prevails .",
    "this behavior is also captured by fig .",

    "coarsening has also been observed in other models relevant to opinion formation and social dynamics @xcite . unlike other minimalist ( typically two - state ) models often employed to study opinion formation @xcite , such as the one studied by sznajd - weron & sznajd @xcite , the voter model @xcite , or the majority rule model @xcite",
    ", in the ng , each agent can be in an _ unlimited _ number of discrete states ( corresponding to a chosen word ) .",
    "further , at any instant before reaching global consensus , an agent can have different possible words for the object .",
    "because of the potentially unlimited number of discrete states the agents can assume , the late - stage evolution of the ng resembles that of infinite - state ( @xmath35@xmath12@xmath36 ) potts model @xcite .",
    "while rgg is a random structure , it is embedded in two dimensions , and we also attempt to employ elementary scaling arguments from coarsening theory . according to ref .",
