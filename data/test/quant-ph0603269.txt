    "entanglement plays a central role in quantum information theory .",
    "it is considered a resource for quantum communication and teleportation , as well as for various computational tasks @xcite .",
    "the importance of understanding entanglement in a relativistic setting has received considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "such an understanding is certainly relevant from a fundamental point of view , since relativity is an indispensable component of any complete theoretical model .",
    "however , it is also important in a number of practical situations , for example , when considering the implementation of quantum information processing tasks performed by observers in arbitrary relative motion .",
    "entanglement was shown to be an invariant quantity for observers in uniform relative motion in the sense that , although different inertial observers may see these correlations distributed among several degrees of freedom in different ways , the total amount of entanglement is the same in all inertial frames @xcite . in non - inertial frames ,",
    "entanglement was first studied indirectly by investigating the fidelity of teleportation between two parties in relative uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "more recently , the observer - dependent character of entanglement was explicitly demonstrated by studying the entanglement between two modes of a free scalar field as viewed by two relatively accelerated observers @xcite .",
    "a uniformly accelerated observer is unable to access information about the whole of spacetime since , from his perspective , a communication horizon appears .",
    "this can result in a loss of information and a corresponding degradation of entanglement .",
    "in essence , the acceleration of the observer effects a kind of `` enviromental decoherence '' , limiting the fidelity of certain quantum information - theoretic processes . a quantitative understanding of such degradation in non - inertial frames is therefore required if one wants to discuss the implementation of certain quantum information processing tasks between accelerated partners .    in curved spacetime",
    "two nearby inertial observers are relatively accelerated due to the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "accordingly , the results of @xcite indicate that in curved spacetime even two inertial observers will disagree on the degree of entanglement in a given bipartite quantum state of some quantum field .",
    "indeed , a thorough investigation into entanglement in an expanding curved spacetime shows that entanglement can encode information concerning the underlying spacetime structure @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the entanglement between two modes of a dirac field described by relatively accelerated parties in a flat spacetime .",
    "we are interested in understanding how both the crucial sign change in fermi - dirac versus bose - einstein distributions , and the finite number of allowed states in fermionic systems due to the pauli exclusion principle ( in contrast to the unbounded excitations that can occur in bosonic systems ) , affect the degradation of entanglement produced by the unruh effect .",
    "we find that unlike the bosonic case , where the entanglement degrades completely in the infinite acceleration limit , in the fermionic case the entanglement is never completely destroyed .",
    "we analyze the degradation of entanglement in the system by applying the constraints of entanglement sharing @xcite and track the information originally encoded in these quantum correlations by employing a set of multi - qubit complementarity relations @xcite . as in @xcite , our results can be applied to the case that alice falls into a black hole whilst rob barely escapes through eternal uniform acceleration .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setting ] we consider two modes of a free dirac field that are maximally entangled from an inertial perspective .",
    "two parties , an inertial observer named alice and a uniformly accelerating observer named rob , are each assumed to possess a detector sensitive only to one of the two modes .",
    "each measures the field with his / her detector and the results are compared in order to estimate the entanglement between the modes .",
    "section  [ sec : unruh ] discusses the unruh effect for dirac particles as experienced by rob .",
    "if a given dirac mode is in the vacuum state from an inertial perspective , then rob s detector perceives a fermi - dirac distribution of particles .",
    "this has a strong effect on the entanglement that exists between alice and rob , and therefore plays an important role in any quantum information task they might perform that uses this entanglement as a resource .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ent ] we calculate the entanglement between the modes from the perspectives of both alice and rob .",
    "due to the presence of a rindler horizon , rob is forced to trace over a causally disconnected region of spacetime that he can not access .",
    "accordingly , his description of the system takes the form of a two - qubit mixed state .",
    "we calculate the entanglement using mixed state entanglement measures such as the entanglement of formation @xcite and the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the total correlations ( classical plus quantum ) via the mutual information @xcite .",
    "our results show that the entanglement of formation does not vanish as it does in the bosonic case , but rather reaches a minimum of @xmath0 in the limit that rob moves with infinite acceleration .",
    "since the fermionic system we are considering is accurately described by a pure state of three qubits , we study the constraints placed on the system by the phenomenon of entanglement sharing in sec .",
    "[ sec : ent_sharing ] .",
    "our analysis shows that no inherently three - body correlations are generated in the quantum state .",
    "that is , all of the entanglement in the system is in the form of bipartite correlations , regardless of rob s rate of acceleration .",
    "using complementarity relations applicable to an overall pure state of three qubits , as well as to the various two - qubit marginals , we identify the different types of information encoded in the quantum state of our system in sec .",
    "[ sec : complementarity ] .",
    "this enables us to study how specific subsystem properties depend on rob s rate of acceleration and to explain how some of the entanglement from the inertial frame is able to survive in the fermionic system , even at infinite acceleration . finally , we summarize our results and suggest possible directions for further research in sec .

    "minkowski coordinates @xmath6 with @xmath7 are the most suitable to describe the field from an inertial perspective .",
    "the field can be expanded in terms of the positive ( fermions ) and negative ( antifermions ) energy solutions of the dirac equation @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , since they form a complete orthonormal set of modes , @xmath10 in the above , @xmath11 is a notational shorthand for the wavevector @xmath12 which labels the modes .",

    "the minkowski vacuum state is defined by the absence of any mode excitations in an inertial frame , @xmath29where the @xmath30 superscript on the kets is used to indicate the particle and anti - particle vacua , respectively so that @xmath31 .",
    "we will use the notation here , and throughout the rest of the work , that the mode index ( @xmath32 ) will be a subscript affixed to the occupation number inside the ket , and that the absence of a subscript on the outside of the ket indicates a minkowski fock state .",
    "since @xmath33 , there are only two allowed states for each mode , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for particles , and similarly for anti - particles .",
    "consider two maximally entangled fermionic modes in an inertial frame , @xmath36 and @xmath37 indicate the modes associated with the observers alice and rob , respectively .",
    "all other modes of the field are in the vacuum state , and therefore the state can be written as @xmath38 .",
    "now assume that alice is stationary and has a detector sensitive only to mode @xmath39 .",
    "rob moves with uniform acceleration and takes with him a detector that only detects particles corresponding to mode @xmath40 .",
    "we ask the question of what is the entanglement between modes @xmath39 and @xmath40 observed by alice and rob , given that rob undergoes uniform acceleration .",
    "note that in order to determine the amount of entanglement , alice and rob perform measurements which are then compared by either party in order to estimate the correlations in the results . due to rob s acceleration , at some point",
    "alice s signals will no longer reach rob , but rob s signals will always be available to alice , ( see ) . at this point",
    "only alice can compare the measurement results and estimate the entanglement of the state .",
    "let us now consider the state observed by rob .",
    "consider rob to be uniformly accelerated in the @xmath41 plane ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "rindler coordinates @xmath43 are appropriate for describing the viewpoint of an observer moving with uniform acceleration .",
    "two different sets of rindler coordinates , which differ from each other by an overall change in sign , are necessary for covering minkowski space @xcite .",
    "these sets of coordinates define two rindler regions that are causally disconnected from each other .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes rob s proper acceleration . the above set of coordinates both",
    "give rise to the same metric @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the same in both minkowski and rindler spacetimes .",
    "are hyperbolas and lines of constant proper time @xmath48 for the accelerated observer run through the origin .",
    "note that while @xmath48 flows in the direction of @xmath49 in region i , it flows in the direction of @xmath50 in region ii , ( i.e the dashed line rotates counter - clockwise for increasing values of @xmath48 ) .",
    "a uniformly accelerated observer rob ( @xmath37 ) with acceleration @xmath45 travels on a hyperbola constrained to region i , while a fictitious observer anti - rob @xmath51 travels on a corresponding hyperbola in region ii given by the negative of rob s coordinates .",
    "the horizons @xmath52 are lines of @xmath53 which alice ( @xmath54 ) will cross at finite minkowski times.,width=336,height=240 ]    a particle undergoing eternal uniform acceleration remains constrained to either rindler region i or ii and has no access to the opposite region , since these two regions are causally disconnected .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] serves to illustrate these ideas , as well as to introduce our labeling scheme , where we refer to the accelerated observer in region i as rob ( r ) and to the corresponding fictitious observer confined to region ii ( whose coordinates are the negative of rob s ) as anti - rob @xmath55 .    the coordinates @xmath43 have the ranges @xmath56 separately in region i and in region ii .",
    "this implies that region i and ii each admit a separate quantization procedure with corresponding positive and negative energy solutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since the rindler metric is static ( independent of @xmath48 ) it will admit solutions of the form @xmath59 , with @xmath60 a spatially dependent spinor @xcite .",
    "particles and anti - particles will be classified with respect to the future - directed timelike killing vector in each region . in region",
    "i this is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 which is a boost into the instantaneous comoving frame of rob .",
    "thus , mode solutions in region i having time dependence @xmath63 with @xmath64 represent positive frequency solutions since @xmath65 .",
    "however , in region ii @xmath61 points in the opposite direction of @xmath66 ( increasing @xmath48 flows in the direction of @xmath50 , see ) .",
    "hence in region ii the future - directed timelike killing vector is given by @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "thus , a solution in region ii with time dependence @xmath68 with @xmath64 is actually a negative frequency mode since @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the positive frequency mode in region ii is given by @xmath70 with @xmath64 satisfying @xmath71 .",
    "due to the causally disjoint nature of region i and ii , the modes @xmath72 have support only in region i and vanish in region ii , while the opposite is true for the modes @xmath73 in region ii .",
    "the rindler modes satisfy orthonormality relations analogous to the minkowski modes @xcite @xmath74 , and @xmath75 where @xmath76 .    in region",
    "i , let us denote @xmath77 as the annihilation and creation operators for fermions ( particles ) and @xmath78 as the annihilation and creation operators for anti - fermions ( anti - particles ) .",
    "the corresponding particle and anti - particle operators in region ii are denoted as @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these obey the usual dirac anti - commutation relations @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 , with all other anti - commutators , including those between operators in region i and the causally disconnected region ii , equaling zero .",
    "taking into account the two sets of modes in each rindler region , the dirac field can be expanded , in analogy to , as @xmath84    and represent the decomposition of the dirac field in minkowski and rindler modes , respectively .",
    "we can therefore relate the minkowski and rindler creation and annihilation operators by taking appropriate inner products . using the rindler orthogonality relations and we have @xmath85 . substituting for @xmath86 in this last expression yields c^_k = dk ( ^_kk a_k + ^_kk b^_k ) , \\{i , ii } where the bogoliubov coefficients are given by the inner product of the rindler modes wavefunctions with the minkowski positive and negative frequency modes ^_kk = ( ^+_k , ^+_k ) , ^_kk = ( ^+_k , ^-_k ) .",
    "a similar calculation for @xmath87 yields the corresponding expression d^_k = dk ( ^_kk b_k + ^_kk a^_k ) , \\{i , ii } with the same bogoliubov coefficient as in . in deriving use has been made of the following properties of the dirac inner product : @xmath88 .",
    "the calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients is straightforward , though lengthy and an exercise in special functions .",
    "details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for our purposes , the end result of such calculations yields a relationship between the minkowski and rindler creation and annihilation operators given by the bogoliubov transformation = , where @xmath89 with @xmath90 , the ratio of the frequency @xmath91 to the only naturally occurring frequency in the problem @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is an unimportant phase that can always be absorbed into the definition of the operators .",
    "it is easy to see from and its adjoint that given the anti - commutation relations of the rindler operators , the minkowski anti - commutation relations are preserved . in",
    "we have made the @xcite , which is valid if we consider rob s detector as sensitive to a single particle mode in region i such that we can approximate the frequency @xmath94 observed by alice to be the same as the frequency @xmath95",
    "as observed by rob , i.e @xmath96 @xcite . note that this bogoliubov transformation mixes a particle in region i and an anti - particle in region ii .",
    "correspondingly , the bogoliubov transformation that mixes an anti - particle mode in region i and a particle in region ii is given by = .",
    "since the anti - commutators between particle and anti - particle operators and between region i and region ii rindler operators are zero , it is easy to see that the minkowski operators in anti - commute with the minkowski operators in , as they should ( since @xmath11 and @xmath97 represent two separate modes ) .    as stated above , reveals that the minkowski particle annihilation operator is a bogoliubov transformation between a particle in region i of momentum @xmath11 and an anti - particle in region ii of momentum @xmath97 , i.e. a transformation that mixes creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we can understand this in terms of our previous discussion of the time dependence of positive frequency rindler modes in regions i and ii . for a massless dirac field",
    "a positive frequency rindler mode has the form @xcite @xmath98 ( for the scalar case see @xcite ) and a positive frequency rindler mode in region ii has the form @xmath99 .",
    "thus , in order to construct a positive frequency minkowski mode @xmath100 that extends @xmath101 analytically from region i to region ii , we need a linear combination of @xmath101 and @xmath102 so that both have the space and time dependence @xmath103 .",
    "this means that the minkowski operator @xmath104 must mix @xmath105 and @xmath106 as in . similarly , to construct a minkowski mode that analytically extends @xmath107 from region ii to region i we must form a linear combination of @xmath107 and @xmath108 so that both have the space and time dependence @xmath109",
    "this corresponds to @xmath110 mixing @xmath111 and @xmath112 as in . for a massive dirac field",
    "the time dependence of the rindler modes remains the same , but the spatial dependence is more complicated @xcite .",
    "the above argument for the mixing of rindler particles ( anti - particles ) in region i ( ii ) and anti - particles ( particles ) in region ii",

    "we note that the form of the dirac particle vacuum for mode @xmath11 in , which can be written as @xmath132 , is complementary to the form of the minkowski charged scalar vacuum for mode @xmath11 , which is given by @xcite @xmath133 where in the latter case @xmath134 is defined by @xmath135 .",
    "qualitatively , in going from the scalar field to the dirac field , scalar mode functions are replaced by spinors , the infinite number of equally spaced bosonic levels are replaced by two fermionic levels , and the hyperbolic functions in the bogoluibov transformation between minkowski and rindler modes / operators are replaced by the corresponding trigonometric functions ( in essence @xmath136 in going from the scalar to the dirac field ) .    the two minkowski states , @xmath124 and @xmath130 , correspond to the particle field of mode @xmath11 observed by alice . on the other hand , an observer moving with uniform acceleration @xmath45 in one of the regions has no access to field modes in the causally disconnected region .",
    "therefore , the observer must trace over the inaccessible region , constituting an unavoidable loss of information about the state , which essentially results in the detection of a mixed state .",

    "the work @xmath145 that is performed on the particle to keep it in uniform acceleration is the product of @xmath140 times a characteristic distance through which the force acts , which we take to be the compton wavelength of the particle @xmath146 .",
    "this yields @xmath147 , which is proportional to @xmath148 in .",
    "thus , the energy that is supplied to keep @xmath3 under constant acceleration goes into exciting rob s detector , and curiously has a thermal spectrum ( see @xcite ) . in the general relativistic case",

    "the state of the minkowski vacuum for mode @xmath11 is a two - mode squeezed state ( bosonic and fermionic , respectively ) , which to a uniformly accelerated observer confined entirely to region i , is detected as a thermal state ( be and fd , respectively ) .    in the following",
    "we investigate how the unruh effect for dirac particles affects the entanglement between various dirac modes .",
    "specifically , we study the entangled bell state given by in the case that rob is uniformly accelerated in region i. assuming a detector for rob that is sensitive to a single rindler particle mode ( @xmath149 ) , we decompose rob s single particle minkowski states in into the appropriate rindler particle and anti - particle states utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ vacm ] ) and ( [ 1 m ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to evaluate various measures of entanglement .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the advantage of utilizing a dirac field over a bosonic scalar field is that due to the finite occupation of the fermionic states , we obtain finite dimensional density matrices that lead to closed form expressions for the entanglement measures that are more easily interpreted than their infinite dimensional bosonic counterparts .",
    "in this and subsequent sections we will use the following notation : @xmath54 will indicate the inertial observer alice , i will indicate the uniformly accelerated observer rob ( r ) confined to region i , and ii will indicate the fictitious complementary observer anti - rob ( @xmath150 ) in region ii ( see ) , that arises from the second ( negative ) set of rindler coordinates in .",
    "furthermore , since we are in the single mode approximation , we will drop all labels ( @xmath151 ) on states and density matrices indicating the specific mode .",

    "unfortunately , there is no analog of the schmidt decomposition for mixed states , and the von - neumann entropy is no longer a good measure of mixed state entanglement .",
    "a set of conditions that mixed state entanglement measures should satisfy is well known @xcite . there is no unique measure , and several different mixed state entanglement measures have been proposed . among the most popular are those related to the formation and distillation of entangled states .",
    "consider the number @xmath3 of maximally entangled pairs needed to create @xmath179 arbitrarily good copies of an arbitrary pure state using only local operations and classical communication .",

    "as shown in @xcite , the memms are characterized by the relationship @xmath303 , i.e. , the marginal mixednesses are equal to the separable uncertainties . thus , our fermionic system encodes the maximum amount of bipartite entanglement consistent with the separable uncertainty in each two - qubit marginal for every possible value of the acceleration rate .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the entanglement between two modes of a free dirac field in a non - inertial frame in flat spacetime from the point of view of two observers , alice and rob , in relative uniform acceleration .",

    "any entanglement existing in the fermionic system is therefore necessarily bipartite .",
    "such entanglement is known to be an invariant quantity for inertial observers , although different inertial observers may see these quantum correlations distributed among multiple degrees of freedom in different ways . however , in this analysis we find no indication that the entanglement in any bipartite subsystem is conserved when rob is allowed to accelerate .",
    "in fact , our results show that the presence of the communication horizon , which isolates the modes in region ii from an accelerated observer in region i , plays a key role in degrading the inertial entanglement between alice and rob .",
    "further insight into this behavior is gained by applying both pure and mixed state complementarity relations to different divisions of the system into subsystems .",
    "the ability of this formalism to identify the different types of information encoded in a quantum state facilitates the study of how various subsystem properties depend on rob s rate of acceleration .",
    "for instance , the constraints imposed by these relations illustrate how multi - qubit complementarity prevents the entanglement between alice and rob from vanishing at infinite acceleration as it does in the bosonic case . additionally , we find that the amount of vacuum thermalization ( due to unruh radiation ) that rob experiences at infinite acceleration is constrained by the amount of entanglement that he shares with alice in an inertial frame .",
    "one possible avenue for further research along these lines is to study the entanglement between alice and rob in the case that alice has acceleration @xmath305 and rob has acceleration @xmath306 . in this case",
    "the density matrix , after tracing over region ii is      where @xmath308 and @xmath309 . in this case",
    "the logarithmic negativity is @xmath310 .",
    "thus , we see that the entanglement is further degraded by having two accelerated observers , but again remains finite , in this case taking on the value @xmath311 in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "another aspect of this problem that deserves further consideration is the nature of the communication that is and is not allowed between observers in different regions .",
    "of course , no communication is possible between the left and right rindler wedges ( regions i and ii ) .",
    "however , even when two parties are not causally disconnected from one another ( e.g. alice and rob in ) , the presence of a horizon due to the acceleration of an observer imposes a unidirectionality on any classical communication occurring after the inertial observer crosses the horizon . given the connection between the horizons seen by accelerated observers , and the event horizon of a black hole , this in turn suggests the potential for gaining further insight into questions related to the black hole information paradox .",

    "we can then approximate the minkowski annihilation operator by a single unruh annihilation operator , which is then related to a rindler particle annihilation operator in region i and a rindler anti - particle creation operator in region ii through a bogoliubov transformation ( see the discussion in the last paper in @xcite ) .",
    "similar relations exist for the operators @xmath340 and @xmath111 namely , @xmath341 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 , and @xmath344 .",
    "however , these operators correspond to the mode @xmath97 , which we have ignored in the single mode approximation .",
    "let the intial unaccelerated state between alice and rob be the tensor product of minkowski states @xmath345 where @xmath346 is any state ( possibly mixed ) for alice and @xmath86 is any pure state for rob .",
    "since entanglement is invariant under local unitaries , we can always rotate @xmath347 to @xmath124 , the minkowski vacuum for mode @xmath11 given in , without changing the initial entanglement .",
    "then the reduced state for rob is just @xmath348 , which has maximal entanglement between i and ii at infinite acceleration ."
