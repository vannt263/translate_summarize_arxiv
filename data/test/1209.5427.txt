    "the diffuse spectrum of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( cr ) is expected to consist of a superposition of fluxes from many individual point - sources distributed throughout the universe .",

    "typically this number is very large and the uhe cr spectrum is expected to reflect the average contribution of these sources .",

    "an analogous argument can be given for an anisotropic cr emitter with a preferred local ( but not global ) emission direction .",
    "this applies to jet - like source emission like in blazars or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "if the emission is concentrated in a cone @xmath161 we can again define a reduced effective local density @xmath162 that compensates the enhanced isotropic - equivalent emission rate @xmath163 .    we can hence account for time - variable or anisotropic sources by rescaling the local source density .",
    "these two effects work in opposite directions .",
    "time variability increases the number of sources contributing to the spectrum and lowers the amplitude of the ensemble fluctuation by @xmath164 . on the other hand",
    ", anisotropy decreases the source number and increases the fluctuation by @xmath165 .",
    "note , however , that autocorrelation studies of uhe cr constrain the number of sources and limit the effective source density @xmath166 . hence , the lower limit of @xmath167 used in this analysis does still apply .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to consider the effect of magnetic fields on the propagation of uhe crs .",
    "this has been so far neglected in this study . as mentioned before , a magnetic field ( regular or turbulent ) has no effect on a spatially homogeneous distribution of sources .",
    "however , we break homogeneity by introducing a minimal distance @xmath82 in our calculation .",
    "it was shown for the case of protons sources that diffusion in intergalactic magnetic fields can have a significant effect on the extra - galactic cr spectrum at lower energies .",
    "the limited distance to the closest source introduces a low energy suppression , sometimes called `` anti - gzk - cutoff ''  @xcite . in this case",
    ", ensemble - fluctuations at the low energies close the cr ankle can increase dramatically beyond the adiabatic value ( [ eq : adisig ] ) considered in this paper .    on top of these spectral variations",
    "there is also an effect on the the effective source density @xmath166 . with magnetic diffusion the time - scale @xmath156 and emission cone",
    "@xmath161 are expected to disperse .",
    "eventually , for strong diffusion the effective local density @xmath166 is simply the true density @xmath84 .",
    "since the diffusion coefficient does in general depend on the rigidity of the cr nuclei this effect would introduce an additional energy dependence of the variation .    in conclusion , future space - based observatories with colossal exposures , @xmath143 , will provide the required large statistics at the high - energy end of the cr spectrum , allowing identification of ensemble fluctuation from the gzk suppression features on a statistical basis . in combination with information on the arrival - direction distribution of crs and on the secondary fluxes of @xmath4-rays and neutrinos these spectral features can provide a coherent picture for an _ indirect _ determination of the uhe cr nuclear composition  @xcite and will naturally complement the current _ direct _ measurements of extensive air shower observables .",
