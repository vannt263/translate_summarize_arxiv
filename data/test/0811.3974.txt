    "the am cvn stars are a small , but growing class of ultracompact binaries that consist of a white dwarf accretor and a degenerate helium - transferring donor star .",
    "they are characterized by their short orbital periods ( below the orbital period minimum for hydrogen - rich donors ) and the lack of hydrogen in their spectra .",
    "there are currently 22 members , including the new system reported here and the two ultrashort - period candidates hm cnc ( rxj0806 + 15 , @xcite ) and v407 vul ( rxj1914 + 24 , @xcite ) . a recent overview is given by @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the am cvn stars has been increasing rapidly in the last few years .",
    "this is due to more detailed observational studies of known systems ( e.g. @xcite ) and more detailed physical models ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but in large part also due to an increase in the number of objects known ( e.g.  @xcite ) . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) has proven to be an important resource for the discovery of new am cvn stars , with six new systems so far .",
    "more importantly , since the sdss sample is relatively well defined , those six systems provide information about the underlying galactic population that is difficult to obtain from the rather random individual discoveries from the pre - sdss era ( roelofs , nelemans & groot 2007b ) .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the photometric database of the sdss , phase i ( sdss - i , or data release 5 ) should contain a total of about 50 am cvn stars down to a magnitude of @xmath4 ( but with substantial uncertainty of a factor 23 due to , in part , the small sample of six systems from the spectroscopic database ) .",
    "we have started an extensive observing program using an array of telescopes to uncover this ` hidden ' population of am cvn stars .",
    "the significance of this sample will not only be to double or triple the total known population , but more importantly to increase the number of systems that have been found in a relatively well - understood way by an even larger factor , which will allow for a much more detailed comparison of their population with theoretical predictions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ] we discuss the total sample of am cvn candidates we selected from the sdss , data release 6 ( sdss - dr6 ; @xcite ) . in section  [ sec : observing ] we discuss our strategy for spectroscopic identification of this sample , and in section [ sec:0804 ] we present the first new am cvn star found in this way .",
    "we discuss the newly discovered system in section [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the known am cvn stars span a range in @xmath5 colour space that lies substantially and slightly above the da and db white dwarf cooling sequences , respectively .",
    "the das are much redder in @xmath6 due to the balmer jump in their spectra , which is absent in the hydrogen - deficient am cvns and dbs .",
    "see figure [ fig : colours ] in which we have plotted the @xmath5 and @xmath7 colour diagrams of the known am cvn stars , the colours of the am cvn candidates selected here , and model colours of the cooling sequences of da and db white dwarfs of mass @xmath8 .",
    "the latter were calculated from model spectra kindly provided by d. koester .",
    "all object colours are the _ dereddened _ colours from the sdss - dr6 , which were corrected for the full galactic reddening according to @xcite .",
    "the assumption is that , at the high galactic latitudes spanned by the sdss , almost all of the am cvns will be further from the galactic plane than the scale height of dust in the galaxy . models of the am cvn population @xcite show that the systems are expected to be several gyr old on average , measured from the zero - age main sequence : similar to old thin - disk main - sequence stars that are characterized by a galactic scale height @xmath0300 pc .",
    "galactic dust , on the other hand , is known to have a scale height of about 100 pc @xcite .",
    "angular momentum losses due to the emission of gravitational waves will cause an am cvn binary to evolve to an orbital period longer than 30 minutes in only @xmath0100myr , counted from orbital period minimum . combined with reasonable assumptions about the star formation history and the distribution of the delay times between star formation and the birth of am cvn stars , this implies that @xmath098% of the local am cvn population should have @xmath9min . in this ` long ' orbital period regime",
    "the am cvns are expected @xcite and observed @xcite to be dominated in the optical by an accreting white dwarf of typical temperature 10,00020,000k , with a corresponding absolute magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the am cvns ( as well as hot , single white dwarfs ) down to an apparent magnitude @xmath11 in the sdss will be several 100pc , i.e.  several dust scale heights , above the galactic plane .",
    "it also implies that , for the faintest systems , we are still covering the am cvns out to about one scale height of the galactic thin disk population ( @xmath0300pc ) if we include objects as faint as @xmath11 . at fainter magnitudes",
    ", we anticipate that spectroscopic follow - up will become exceedingly difficult .    . ]",
    "-band magnitude and galactic @xmath12-band extinction @xmath13 in our sample shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] . ]    guided by the colours of the known am cvn stars , and attempting to reduce contamination by other sources as much as possible ( see below ) , we have queried the sdss - dr6 photometric database with the following relatively simple set of criteria ( colours are dereddened ) :    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      . ]    min .",
    "higher - velocity emission , up to 1500 km / s , is seen to vary on the same period .",
    "the grey - scale indicates the relative flux densities . ]",
    "variability in the spectral lines , typically in the form of a sinusoidal ` s - wave ' in spectroscopic time - series , is observed in most of the am cvn stars and all of the long - period , emission - line systems @xcite . following the procedure of @xcite",
    "we compute a lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram of the ratios of fluxes in the red and blue wings of the emission lines of sdssj0804 + 1616 .",
    "see figure [ fig : scargle ] .",
    "a strong variability peak is seen centered on 32.4 cycles per day , or 44.5 minutes .",
    "the short observing baseline and equal spacing of the individual blocks of spectra create strong aliases at 1 cycle / day intervals , but regardless of the spectral lines or velocity limits chosen for the red - wing / blue - wing periodogram , the 44.5-minute period comes out as the strongest peak .",
    "since the red - wing / blue - wing method does not optimally utilize the variability information contained in the spectroscopic time - series , we also do a ` double - blind ' ( but subjective ) test to judge by eye at which folding period , in the range 20120 minutes , the strongest variability pattern occurs .",
    "this yields @xmath14min , a perfect match to the period obtained from the lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram .",
    "the corresponding trailed spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : trail ] .",
    "it shows a clear s - wave with a velocity amplitude of @xmath15km / s , as well as asymmetric higher - velocity emission extending to about 1,500km / s on the red side .",
    "based on the sinusoidal s - wave feature we propose that @xmath16min .",
    "a similar picture is seen at the @xmath17 cycle / day aliases of this period , as expected , while for the @xmath18 cycles / day ( and more distant ) aliases the pattern fades .",
    "no variability is seen on periods other than aliases of the main signal .",
    "we consider the @xmath17 cycle / day aliases possible , and the more distant aliases unlikely , to represent the actual orbital period .",
    "the time coverage of the present data is insufficient to track the s - wave from one night to the next and break the aliases , but the data suffice to firmly establish the ultracompact nature of the binary , thereby confirming its membership of the am cvn family .    with the s - wave period in hand",
    ", we revisit our imacs data obtained one month earlier .",
    "no s - wave is seen in any of the lines or combination of lines , nor for any alias of the s - wave period .",
    "although the imacs data have a slightly lower resolution , lower signal - to - noise ratio , and shorter baseline , we would have expected to see a sign of the s - wave in the corresponding trailed spectrum if it were as strong as in the mage spectra .",
    "we conclude that the pattern of orbital - period variations must change on timescales of one month .",
    "the first new am cvn star from our survey of candidates from the sdss poses an interesting optical spectrum : devoid of hydrogen , but rich in nitrogen , with strikingly strong lines of ionised nitrogen and helium .",
    "the high nitrogen abundance puts constraints on the prior evolution of the donor star , in particular the amount of helium burning that may have taken place .",
    "detailed helium star models for the donor stars in am cvns predict typical surface abundance ratios",
    "n / c=0.001@xmath191 at orbital periods @xmath2030min @xcite , while for white dwarf donor stars one expects n / c@xmath210.1 ( if the cno cycle never operated during the donor s hydrogen - burning phase ) or n / c@xmath221 ( if the cno cycle has converted most of the primordial c and o into n ) .",
    "this suggests that the donor star in sdssj0804 + 1616  has not had a phase of helium burning , implying that the helium - star model for the formation of am cvn stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) does not apply to sdssj0804 + 1616 .",
    "the lower limits of the observed n / c and n / o abundances could be _ marginally _ consistent with the lowest - possible amount of helium burning in the models of @xcite , corresponding to a helium star that is already almost filling its roche lobe upon reaching the zero - age helium main sequence , but this requires fine - tuning .",
    "the ` evolved - cv ' model for the formation of am cvn stars @xcite predicts essentially the same cno abundances as the helium white dwarf model , and is thus compatible as far as the observed cno abundances are concerned .",
    "while the lte emission line model used to derive the relative cno abundances is rather simple , it seems unlikely that a more detailed treatment including non - lte effects could succeed in suppressing all the expected lines of c and o while reproducing the observed lines of n , without an actual nitrogen overabundance .",
    "it would however be worthwhile to try to apply such models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis could be that sedimentation of c and o in the outer layers of the donor star precludes these elements from showing up in the spectrum , or that we are seeing the previously sedimented n in what is now just the inner few @xmath23 of the original donor .",
    "this mechanism is unlikely to work , however , since none of these elements should sink into a degenerate helium donor star , given the identical mass - to - charge ratios of the c , n , o and he nuclei involved .",
    "a large nitrogen abundance is far from unique among the am cvn stars , rather the opposite : anomalously large n / c line ratios in the far - uv spectrum of v396 hya were noted by @xcite , while the x - ray spectra of several others were best modelled with cno - cycled or even higher nitrogen abundances @xcite .",
    "combined with the results of @xcite , this would suggest that most of the known am cvns do not harbour formerly helium - burning donor stars , even though the large observed luminosities of the short - period am cvns are much more readily explained if one does assume such donors @xcite .",
    "further information about sdssj0804 + 1616  may be obtained from the profiles of its emission lines .",
    "their unique single - peakedness is not simply an inclination effect , since the lines are very broad compared to those in other emission - line am cvns that still clearly show a double - peaked accretion disc profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most likely explanation , also in view of the large / and / line ratios , is that the system is magnetic : broad , single - peaked , almost gaussian emission lines with strong series of ionised helium are characteristic of magnetic cvs and the spectrum of sdssj0804 + 1616  is a perfect match , save for the absence of hydrogen ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "optical polarimetry should be pursued to confirm the magnetic nature of the system , and near - infrared spectroscopy might reveal cyclotron emission features as further evidence for the presence of strong magnetic fields .    a final , intriguing question is whether we should not have found more than one am cvn star amongst the candidates observed so far .",
    "the hit - rate does appear to be below expectations ( section [ sec : sample ] ) , but may at this point simply suffer from low - number statistics and the fact that we have so far only targeted the bright end of the sample , which means that we have probably observed a different population of objects than the average of the entire sample . once the entire sample has been completed , a full analysis as described in @xcite will have to be done , which will give a revised and more accurate space density for the galactic am cvn population .",
    "we have described a spectroscopic survey aimed at identifying all of the @xmath040 expected emission - line am cvn stars in an estimated 90% complete sample of 1,523  candidates , drawn from a colour selection of the sloan digital sky survey , data release 6 , down to @xmath11 . the aim is to greatly increase the size and completeness of the sample of am cvn stars from the sdss , allowing for a much more accurate assessment of the total galactic population .",
    "we have presented time - resolved spectroscopy confirming the first new am cvn star from this survey , sdssj080449.49 + 161624.8 , and measured an orbital period of @xmath1min , or possibly one of its nearest daily aliases .",
    "the single - peaked emission lines as well as the strong lines of ionised helium , both unique among the long - period am cvns known to date , are very much reminiscent of the magnetic systems among the hydrogen - rich cataclysmic variables , and we suggest that sdssj0804 + 1616  may be the first ultracompact version of such a system .",
    "the strong lines of nitrogen but non - detections of expected lines of carbon and oxygen suggest that the donor star in sdssj0804 + 1616  contains highly non - solar abundance ratios of these elements .",
    "we have derived , from a simple lte model , lower limits of n / c@xmath310 and n / o@xmath210 by number .",
    "this indicates that the donor star has burned hydrogen via the cno cycle , while it is very unlikely that it has had a subsequent helium - burning phase , effectively ruling out the ` helium - star ' formation scenario for this system .",
