    "this paper concerns the classical ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 are unit vectors , and the couplings @xmath3 have the symmetry of the lattice and may extend several neighbors away ( being frustrated in the interesting cases ) .    after an antiferromagnet s ordering pattern ( or partial information ) is determined by neutron diffraction , the next question is which spin hamiltonian(s ) imply that order , if we admit interactions @xmath4 to second neighbors or @xmath5 to further neighbors .",
    "the starting point for understanding ordered states is always the classical ground state(s ) . if the spins sit on a _ bravais _ lattice ( e.g. face - centered cubic ) , the solution is trivial due to a rigorous recipe , called the  luttinger - tisza \" ( lt ) method ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lt ] below ) : the spins adopt ( at most ) a simple spiral  a _ coplanar _ state , meaning all spins point in the same plane of spin space  @xcite .",
    "but if the spins form a lattice with a basis ( more than one site per primitive cell ) ,  e.g. kagom , diamond , pyrochlore , or half - garnet lattices  no mechanical recipe is known to discover the ground state . in these more complicated lattices , magnetic frustration ( competing interactions )",
    "often induces complicated spin arrangements .",
    "our aim has been to find a recipe for general lattices ( albeit neither exhaustive nor rigorous ) to discover the ground state spin pattern corresponding to a given set of exchange couplings @xmath6 , to neighbors at successive distances .",
    "that is obviously a prerequisite for solving the inverse problem ( given the ordering patterns found by neutron diffraction , which combination(s ) of interactions can explain them ? ) .",
    "furthermore , after the whole phase diagram is mapped out , we can identify the parameter sets leading to exceptionally degenerate or otherwise interesting states , so as to recognize which real or model systems might be close to realizing those special states .",
    "in this work , we focus on a narrower question : which parameter combinations give a _ noncoplanar _ ground state , which could never happen in a bravais lattice ?",
    "we adopt the exchange hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) , excluding single - site anisotropies and dzyaloshinskii - moriya couplings , which can trivially give non - coplanar ground states .",
    "we do not count cases where a non - coplanar ground state belongs to a degenerate family of states that also includes coplanar ground states .",
    "this happens trivially when two sublattices are nt coupled at all , or nontrivially when the interactions are constrained to cancel . in the latter cases thermal or quantum fluctuations usually break the degeneracy , favoring the collinear or coplanar states @xcite .",
    "( a small amount of site - dilution or bond disorder can generate a uniform effective hamiltonian that favors non - coplanar states  @xcite , but here we only consider undisordered systems . )      there are specific physical motivations to hunt for non - coplanar states .",
    "first , they point to possible realizations of _ chiral _",
    "@xcite spin liquids , such as are described within bosonic large-@xmath7 formalisms ( as are hoped to approximate the behavior of frustrated magnets with @xmath8 ) .",
    "such formalisms describe transitions from an ordered state to a quantum - disordered spin liquid ; since there is no generic reason for a state to stop being chiral at the same time it loses spin order , a chiral ordered state presumably transitions into a chiral spin liquid . hence , as a rule of thumb , a chiral spin liquid is feasible if and only if the classical ordered state ( on the same lattice ) is non - coplanar .  @xcite .    secondly , spin non - coplanarity in metals ( usually induced by an external magnetic field ) allows the _ anomalous hall effect _ observed in pyrochlore and other magnets .  @xcite this is ascribed to spin - orbit coupling and the berry phases of hopping electrons ( which are zero in the collinear or coplanar case ) .",
    "thirdly , the symmetry - breaking of noncoplanar exchange - coupled magnetic states is labeled by an order parameter which is an @xmath9 matrix , so the order - parameter manifold is disconnected .",
    "this permits a novel topological defect : the @xmath10 domain wall  @xcite , which is only possible in non - coplanar phases .    finally , there is current interest in `` multiferroic '' materials ( i.e. those with cross couplings of electric and magnetic polarizations ) .",
    "for example , in the canonical multiferroics rmno@xmath11 ( where r = rare earth ) , frustrated exchange interactions induce a coplanar spiral , which in the presence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropic interactions carries an electric polarization with it  @xcite .",
    "if these spirals were asymmetric conic spirals , like our second class of ground states , there is generically a net moment along the axis , which serves as a convenient `` handle '' to externally manipulate the orientation of the ground state ( and thus control the multiferroic properties ) .",
    "our spins sit on a rarely studied lattice we christen the `` octahedral lattice '' , consisting of the medial lattice ( bond midpoints ) of a simple cubic lattice . thus forming corner - sharing octahedra .",
    "thus , each unit cell has a basis of three sites , forming what we call the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 sublattices ( according to the direction of the bond they sit on ) .",
    "each cubic vertex is surrounded by an octahedron of six sites , with nearest - neighbor bonds forming its edges ; these octahedra share corners , much as triangles or tetrahedra share corners in the well - known kagom and pyrochlore lattices .",
    "( indeed , although the `` checkerboard '' lattice was introduced as a two - dimensional version of the pyrochlore lattice  @xcite , the octahedral lattice is the best three - dimensional generalization of the checkerboard lattice . )",
    "this lattice was first studied as a frustrated ising antiferromagnet  @xcite more recently , it was used as a ( simpler / pedagogical ) toy model in papers aimed at the `` coulomb phase '' of highly constrained spins on a pyrochlore lattice  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the lattices constructed from the root lattices of lie algebras .",
    "@xcite    the octahedral sites are wyckoff positions ( and hence candidates for a magnetic lattice ) in most cubic space groups , so this is plausible to find in real materials , and a few are known .",
    "most simply , it is realized by the transition metal sites in the cu@xmath11au superstructure of the fcc lattice  @xcite ( i.e. all but one of the four simple cubic sublattices ) .",
    "so far , the only example known in which the `` cu '' lattice is magnetic seems to be mn@xmath11ge which is ferromagnetic  @xcite another realization is in metallic perovskites such as mn@xmath11snn , though again the known materials are ferromagnetic  @xcite .",
    "it would actually seem quite plausible to find realizations of our models , which mostly have several exchange interactions @xmath6 with competing signs , among metallic alloys : the rkky interaction , expected between local moments in any metal , oscillates with distance inside a slowly decaying envelope .    the octahedral lattice is closely related to the magnetic lattice found in the ( mostly metallic ) ir@xmath11ge@xmath15 structures , including the strong - electron - interaction superconductor mo@xmath11sb@xmath15  @xcite . in that lattice , the simple - cubic lattice sites are surrounded by _",
    "octahedra , i.e. a dimer of _ two _ magnetic ions decorates each bond of the simple cubic lattice .",
    "if this dimer were strongly coupled ferromagnetically , it would be a good approximation to treat it as a single spin , which is exactly the octahedral lattice . instead",
    ", in mo@xmath11sb@xmath15 the dimers are antiferromagnetically coupled and , since mo has spin 1/2 , they form singlets  @xcite . if the spin length were longer , justifying classical treatment , we could convert to the ferromagnetic case simply by inverting the spin directions in every octahedron around an odd site of the cubic lattice , and changing the sign of all bonds coupling even sites with odd sites .",
    "thus , much of the classical phase diagram for the mo@xmath11sb@xmath15 lattice is related to that of the octahedral lattice .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider four kinds of couplings , for separations out to the third neighbors : @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath4 or @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "notice that couplings with the same displacement need not be equivalent by symmetry , since the site symmetry is just fourfold , less than cubic .",
    "( our naming convention is to use the prime for the separation which requires more first - neighbor steps to traverse . )",
    "we also ( less extensively ) consider interactions @xmath22 or @xmath23 for @xmath24 . to organize our exploration of this parameter space , in analytic calculations",
    "we shall often assume @xmath25 ( that suffices to give examples of most of the classes we found of noncoplanar ground states ) .",
    "we begin ( sec .  [ sec : framework ] ) by developing the techniques and concepts necessary to find the phase diagram as a function of the @xmath0 s and to discover _ non - coplanar _ ground states . we found ground states using three methods",
    "the first ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lt ] was fourier analysis , known as the `` luttinger - tisza '' method , which can give a lower bound on the energy , but may not give a full picture of the ground state .",
    "the second ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iter - min ] is an iterative minimization algorithm , which numerically converges to a ground state ; we introduce several diagnostic tools for understanding the spin patterns produced by iterative minimization . the third method ( sec .",
    "[ sec : var ] ) is the variational optimization of idealized patterns displayed by iterative minimization .",
    "we then turn to our results , beginning with descriptions of the several classes of magnetic state we found for the octahedral lattice : various coplanar states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : coplane ] ) , the noncoplanar , commensurate `` cuboctabedral '' spin states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cuboc ] ) , and a more generic group of noncoplanar , incommensurate `` conic spirals '' ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conic ] ) ; in these the lattice breaks up into layers of spins with the same directions , each layer being rotated around the same ( spin - space ) axis relative to the layer below .",
    "particularly noteworthy was a `` double - twist '' state we encountered , which is something like a conic spiral which also has a complex modulation in the transverse directions ( sec .  [ sec : doubletwist ] ) .",
    "the plain stacked structures can be studied by mapping to one - dimensional ( `` chain '' ) lattices , also with couplings to many neighbors , as worked through in sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] .    from this",
    "we go on ( sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] ) to quickly survey the phase diagrams we found , first for the cuboctahedral lattice , and then for the chain lattice ( when treated as a lattice in its own right ) . in the conclusion , sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we reflect on what our results might suggest for other frustrated lattices , such as the pyrochlore .",
    "we employed several approaches to discover and understand ground states , for each given set of interactions ( these are developed rest of this section  except for the use of mappings , which we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : conic ] , where it becomes natural to employ this technique ) .    *",
    ". a fourier analysis of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) as a quadratic form with coefficients @xmath0 , the so - called `` luttinger - tisza '' method outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : lt ] . * .",
    "iterative minimization , our main `` exploratory '' technique .",
    "starting from a random initial condition , we successively adjusted randomly chosen spins so as to reduce the energy .",
    "[ sec : iter - min ] ) .",
    "we then analyzed each resulting pattern with various diagnostics , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : iter - min ] , and tagged the non - coplanar ones for further investigation . * .",
    "variational optimization of the iterative minimization ground state .",
    "finding a closed - form for the ground state introduces a number of free parameters ( the most obvious being a wave - vector ) . by allowing these parameters to vary from the values found with iterative minimization",
    ", we find a new , more rigorous , ground state . * .",
    "mapping the ( three - dimensional ) problem to a similar problem in a one - dimensional `` chain '' lattice with a basis of two sites .",
    "this is valid when the optimal ( three dimensional ) spin configuration is a stacking of layers , which we judged based on the results from approaches ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the states on this simplified chain lattice may be found using approaches ( a ) and ( b ) , or analytically solved after parametrizing the state with a set of variational parameters .",
    "the general theory of spin arrangements is reviewed in refs .   and .",
    "the most fruitful approach to finding the ground states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is to treat it as a quadratic form rewriting ( [ eq : ham ] ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are sublattice indices ; the explicit formulas for the cuboctahedral lattice case are given in appendix [ sec : pert - lt ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt - matrix ] ) . then we diagonalize this matrix , obtaining @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the number of sites per primitive cell , and @xmath31 is a band index ; thus @xmath32 are the eigenvalues of @xmath0 as an @xmath33 matrix , with @xmath7 being the number of cells ( to be taken to infinity ) , and the wavevector @xmath34 runs over the brillouin zone .",
    "[ in the bravais lattice case , @xmath35 , the eigenvalue @xmath36 is simply the fourier transform of @xmath37 ; for @xmath38 . ]",
    "also , @xmath39 ( complex - valued 3-vector ) is the projection of the spin configuration onto the corresponding normalized eigenmode , @xmath40 .",
    "we shall call these the `` luttinger - tisza '' ( lt ) eigenvalues and modes  @xcite ; a mode with the most negative @xmath41 is called an `` optimal '' mode , and its wavevector is called @xmath42 .",
    "the ideal case is that we can build a spin state satisfying two conditions    * _ condition ( 1 ) _",
    "@xmath43 are entirely linear combinations of optimal lt modes * _ condition ( 2 ) _",
    "@xmath44 everywhere ( unit length constraint )    if both conditions are satisfied , these _ must _ be ground states , and all ground states _ must _ be of this form .",
    "in the case of a bravais lattice ( @xmath35 ) , the lt modes are just plane waves @xmath45 , and one can always construct a _ planar _",
    "spiral configuration  @xcite , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are orthogonal unit vectors , and the spatial dependence consists only of optimal modes  @xcite . in the simplest cases ,",
    "@xmath49 is at high symmetry points on brillouin zone corners , and one can construct a combination of optimal modes which is @xmath50 on all sites , which defines a _ collinear _ ground state , as in the phase diagrams in ref .  .",
    "thus , non - bravais lattices are _ necessary _ in order to get non - coplanar states .",
    "( but not sufficient : it appears that , on non - bravais lattices with high symmetry , the commonest ground states are still collinear or coplanar . ) in lattices - with - a - basis , however , the lt eigenmodes have different amplitudes on different sites within the unit cell , and it is not generally possible to make any three - component linear combination of the best modes that satisfies the unit - length constraint .",
    "( there is an exception for lattices in which the neighbors - of - neighbors are all second neighbors , such as the diamond  @xcite or honeycomb  @xcite lattices .",
    "a `` generalized '' l - t method for non - bravais lattices was introduced by ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) and applied to spinels with both a and b sites magnetic @xcite .",
    "however , this method involves site - dependent variational parameters , so one must already understand the pattern of the ground state in order to make it into a finite problem ; in practice , this method appears quite similar to our method ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conic ] and [ sec : pert - state ] ) of projecting a layered structure to a one - dimensional chain .",
    "although the lt optimal modes ( usually ) give the _ exact _ ground states in the cases we focus on , we believe the exact ground state is frequently built mainly from almost - optimal modes ; that is , although a linear combination of optimum lt modes violates the unit - spin constraint , with a small distortion it may satisfy the constraint and be the ground state .",
    "( that distortion necessitates admixing other modes but with small amplitudes , since they carry a large energy penalty , according to ( [ eq : modes - fourier ] ) . ) in particular , we anticipate that ( for incommensurate orderings ) the true ordering wavevector lies in the same symmetry direction as the lt wavevector ; and that the phase diagram for optimum lt wavevectors mostly has the same topology as the actual phase diagram for ground states . thus the lt modes can serve as a `` map '' for navigating the parameter space of @xmath51 and for understanding the ground state spin configurations .",
    "an important caveat is that almost all @xmath52 vectors have symmetry - related degeneracies , and the lt analysis is silent on how these modes are to be combined with different spin directions , so the specification of the actual spin configuration is incomplete .",
    "( an example is the `` double - twist '' state , of sec .",
    "[ sec : doubletwist ] . ) as a corollary , a single phase domain on the lt mode phase diagram might be subdivided into several phases in the spin - configuration phase diagram , that represent different ways of taking linear combinations of the same lt modes .",
    "this can not be detected at the lt level .",
    "one immediate insight is afforded by considering the lt phase diagram .",
    "short - range couplings have fourier transforms @xmath53 in ( [ eq : ham - fourier ] ) that vary slowly in reciprocal space .",
    "such functions typically possess extrema at high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone ; the same is probably true for the optimum _ eigenvalues _ and their wavevectors @xmath49 .",
    "that corresponds to simple , commensurate ordering in real space . in order to get the optimal lt mode ( and presumably the actual ordering ) to be incommensurate , or to possibly stabilize states with stacking directions other than ( 100 )",
    ", one needs to include more distant neighbor couplings .    in practice ,",
    "we never used lt to directly discover the ground state spin configuration ; its value is to quickly prove a given state is a ground state .",
    "but the lt viewpoint did inform the fourier - transform diagnostic we used in analyzing the outputs of iterative relaxation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iter - min ] .",
    "furthermore , when we operated in the `` designer '' mode ( seeking the couplings that stabilize a specified state ) we used the lt modes as a guide or clue : namely , we found the @xmath51 that made the ordering wavevector @xmath52 of our target state to be the optimal @xmath49 , which is easier than making @xmath52 be the ordering wavevector of the actual ground state .",
    "our prime tool for exploration was iterative minimization starting from a random initial condition .",
    "random spins are selected in turn and adjusted ( one at a time ) so as to minimize the energy , by aligning with the local field of their neighbors , till the configuration converged on a local minimum of the hamiltonian .",
    "( our criterion was that the energy change in one sweep over the lattice was less than a chosen tolerance , typically @xmath54 ) .",
    "it might be worried that such an algorithm gets stuck in metastable states , unrepresentative of the ground state ; such `` glassy '' behavior is indeed expected in the case of ising ( or otherwise discrete ) spins , or in _ randomly _ frustrated systems such as spin glasses . however , vector spins typically have sufficient freedom to get close to the true ground state  @xcite .",
    "the typical ways they deviated from the ground state are just long - wavelength wandering ( `` spin waves '' ) or twists of the spin directions .",
    "the only problem with the dynamics is that our algorithm is a variant of `` steepest descent '' , one of the slowest of relaxation algorithms .",
    "such deviation modes are indeed slow relaxing for this kind of ( local ) dynamics , the relaxation rate of a long - wavelength spin wave at wavevector @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 for the slowest mode in a system of side @xmath58 .",
    "( in future applications , some version of conjugate gradient should be applied to give a faster convergence , or ",
    "if there is a problem is finding the right valley of the energy function ",
    "one might adapt elser s `` difference map '' approach to global optimization  @xcite . )    for initial explorations , we usually used very small cubic simulation boxes of @xmath59 cells ( @xmath60 , 4 , or 5 ) .",
    "for each set of @xmath61 tested , we tried both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , as well as even or odd @xmath58 .",
    "usually one of those four cases accomodates an approximation of the infinite system ground state , though of course any incommensurate state must adjust either by twisting to shift the ordering wavevector to the nearest allowed value , or else ( as we observed ) via the formation of wall defects .",
    "we tried to distinguish the ground states which were `` genuine '' in that a similar state would remain stable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , out of the four standard systems we tried ( even / odd system size , periodic / antiperiodic bc s ) , a `` genuine '' state should be the one with lowest energy .    for a large portion of the parameter space ,",
    "the ground states were planar spirals , essentially no different from the solutions guaranteed in the bravais lattice case .",
    "many of the noncoplanar configurations found were `` non - genuine '' artifacts of finite size when the periodic ( or antiperiodic ) boundary conditions and dimension @xmath58 were incompatible with the natural periodicity of the true ground state .",
    "one might expect the wrong boundary condition to simply impose a twist by @xmath62 per layer on the true ground state , but instead the observed distortion of the spin texture was sometimes of the natural periodicity of the ground state , a `` buckling '' occurred ; that is , the configuration consists of finite domains similar to the true ground state , separated by soliton - like domain walls .",
    "the greatest difficulty in our procedure was not obtaining an approximation of the ground state , or even deciding whether it was genuine .",
    "rather , it was grasping what the obtained pattern is , and how to idealize it to a periodic ( or quasiperiodic ) true ground state of the infinite system .",
    "we were aided by the following three diagnostics .",
    "configurations obtained by iterative minimization were fourier transformed and the norms of each fourier component @xmath63 were summed ( combining the sublattices )  @xcite .",
    "this suffices to identify the state when it is a relatively simple antiferromagnetic pattern , or an incommensurate state described as a layer stacking . in any case , the results can be compared to the lt mode calculation to see if the found state achieves the lt bound .",
    "the simplest visual diagnostic of a state is the `` common - origin plot '' , in which each spin s orientation is represented as a point on the unit sphere .",
    "for example , an incommensurate coplanar spiral state would appear as a single great circle on the common - origin plot ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cop ] ) .",
    "a drawback of the common - origin plot is the lack of information on the spatial relation of the spins .",
    "( for example , a `` cone '' might appear consisting of closely spaced spin directions , but these might belong to widely spaced sites . )",
    "furthermore , this diagnostic is quite fragile in configurations where a domain wall or other defect has been quenched in .    in the case of one - dimensional chains ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mapping ] ) , we may instead use the `` end - to - end '' spin plot , where the tail of each spin vector is on the head of the previous spin vector .",
    "the advantage is that ( i ) images are not so obscured by overlaying of different vectors , and ( ii ) spatial information is captured , in particular defects where the state has `` buckled '' .",
    "@xcite    in tandem with the common - origin plot , an algorithm was used that found groups of spins with ( nearly ) identical spin directions , within a chosen tolerance ( typically , a dot product greater than 0.99 ) . for commensurate patterns comprising a finite set of spin directions , this allowed the magnetic unit cell and spin configuration to be read off , but it was useless for incommensurate states , in which no spin direction exactly repeats .    .",

    "we computed the @xmath64 tensor @xmath65 ( notice @xmath66 ) and diagonalized it .",

    "( rotating the spin configuration so the principal directions of @xmath67 are the coordinate axes usually manifests the spin configuration s symmetries . )      through the diagnostic techniques described in the previous subsections , it is normally straightforward to parameterize the spins in the ground as @xmath68 , i.e. as a function of position and some arbitrary set of parameters , @xmath69 .",
    "the exact values of these parameters can ( formally ) be calculated from optimizing @xmath70 .",
    "one major advantage of relying upon this method is that it reduces the effect of numerical artifacts from iterative minimization .",
    "for example , we no longer enforce an arbitrary periodicity upon the lt wavevector .",
    "this subsection is not about a technique , but a classification of two ways that ground states may be related to each other , and thus of two kinds of phase boundaries in the phase diagrams ( sec .  [",
    "sec : phase ] and appendix  [ app : phase - boundaries ] ) .",
    "we call these two concepts `` encompassing states '' and `` families of degenerate states '' .",
    "we call a ground state `` encompassed '' if it is a special case of another , more general state . for example",
    ", a ferromagnet is encompassed by a helimagnet , since letting the helimagnetic angle go to zero produces a ferromagnet .",
    "`` more general '' means there is a continuous family of states such that each particular combination of couplings @xmath6 s completely determines a particular member of that family .",
    "moreover , the ( more general ) encompassing state necessarily spans at least one more dimension of spin space , so if the encompassed state is coplanar , the encompassing one is non - coplanar .",
    "however , while every encompassing state is more general than the state it encompasses , not every more general state will encompass a particular ground state .",
    "for example , the asymmetric conic is more general than the splayed ferromagnet ( both of these states are defined in sec .  [",
    "sec : conic ] ) , but it does not encompass the splayed ferromagnet ; there is , however , a third class that encompasses both these classes .",
    "_ by contrast , `` degenerate states '' means that for certain combinations of @xmath6 s , there is a continuous family of exactly degenerate ground states .",
    "_ most commonly , this is the result of _ decoupling _ between sublattices of spins , meaning one can apply a global rotation limited to just one of the sublattices while remaining in the degenerate manifold .",
    "this can come about in two ways .",
    "the trivial way is when all @xmath6 s that couple those sublattices vanish .",
    "the more interesting way is when the couplings are nonzero , but cancel generically in all the ground states ; the simplest example of this kind is the @xmath16@xmath4 antiferromagnet on the square  @xcite or bcc  @xcite lattice , in the @xmath4-dominated regime in which each of the even and odd sublattices realizes plain nel order . apart from decoupling , degenerate manifolds are also sometimes realized by simultaneous rotations involving all sublattices with some mutual constraint ( e.g. in the nearest - neighbor kagom lattice , the constraint that the spins add to zero in every triangle ) .",
    "independent of the categories mentioned , these degenerate families may either be _ simply degenerate _ , meaning the ground state manifold is labeled by a finite number of parameters  one nontrivial angle in the case of the @xmath16@xmath4 antiferromagnet   or else _ highly degenerate _ , meaning the number of parameters scales with size as @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "an example with trivially decoupled , highly degenerate ground states is a layered lattice with vanishing interlayer couplings , so the number of free parameters scales as @xmath73 ; the @xmath74 kagom antiferromagnet is a mutally constrained , highly degenerate case with @xmath75 parameters , i.e. extensively many .",
    "both the simply and highly degenerate families also have clear signatures in reciprocal space . in the simple case ,",
    "the optimal wavevectors are discrete and related by symmetry , e.g. the @xmath16@xmath4 square lattice antiferromagnet has @xmath76 or @xmath77 ; in this case , the degeneracy lies in the freedom to mix these degenerate lt eigenmodes with different coefficients , not from the presence of extended ( one- , two- , or even three - dimensional ) surfaces in the brillouin zone .",
    "by contrast , in the highly degenerate scenario , typically holding for special combinations of couplings , the lt optimum wavefectors occur not just at isolated @xmath49 in the brillouin zone , but on extended ( one- , two- , or even three - dimensional ) surfaces , i.e. one has degenerate eigenmodes of the lt matrix that are not symmetry - equivalent . the rhombohedral lattice with @xmath16 , @xmath4 , and @xmath20",
    "has a degenerate one - parameter family of wavevectors corresponding to different coplanar spirals  @xcite . the three - dimensional pyrochlore lattice with only nearest - neighbor ( @xmath78 couplings is a well - known example of the highly degenerate scenario , requiring extensive number of parameters . in that case , the minimum @xmath79 eigenvalue is uniform throughout the brillouin zone  @xcite ( a so - called `` flat band '' ) .",
    "what encompassing states and families of degenerate states have in common is to serve as bridges between simple states .    in the `` encompassing '' case ,",
    "the encompassing state is typically stable in a domain of parameter space of nonzero measure .",
    "when one adjacent phase in a phase diagram is encompassed by the other , they are necessarily related ( in our @xmath80 phase diagram ) by a continuous transition , usually involving a symmetry breaking .",
    "in contrast , degenerate families are ( frequently ) confined to phase boundaries . even when they occupy a finite area in a slice of parameter space ( e.g. the @xmath81 plane when all other couplings are zero ) , turning on additional couplings can remove the degeneracy .",
    "a corollary is that the naive classification of continuous or first - order phase transitions does not work .",
    "consider two phases separated by a phase boundary on which a degenerate family is stable .",
    "each of the two phases ( or the limit of either as the boundary is approached ) is a special case from the degenerate family",
    ". since the limits taken from the opposite directions are different , it appears at first as an abrupt transition . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to take the system continuously from one phase to the other if we pause the parameter variation when we hit the phase boundary , and follow a path through the degenerate manifold from one of the limiting states to the other one .",

    "as coupling parameters are varied , that different state might become stable in a first - order transition ; our only systematic ways to address that possibility are ( i ) iterative minimization ( ii ) watching for an exchange of stability between two lt eigenmodes at different wavevectors .",

    "the spatial structure is shown in dotted lines , while couplings are shown in solid lines . ]",
    "this is a hypothetical ( but likely ) class of states . here",
    "`` transversely modulated '' means that when we decompose the lattice as a stacking of layers , a single layer does not have a single spin direction , but instead a pattern of spin directions .",
    "whereas the asymmetric conic spiral used ordering wavevectors ( say ) @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and the alternating conic spiral used @xmath182 and @xmath184 , a transversely modulated spiral might replace the first wavevector by e.g. @xmath185 .",
    "equivalently , if we look at a column of successive cells along the stacking direction , in a plain conic spiral ( whether alternating or asymmetric ) , adjacent columns are in phase , but in the transversely modulated conic spirals , different columns are offset in phase according to a regular pattern .",
    "it should be possible to generalize the chain mapping to such cases , but we have not tried it .",
    "here we describe the incompletely understood `` double - twist '' state , which has attributes in common with both cuboctahedral and conic states , and was observed only for a small set of couplings ( @xmath1862 , @xmath187 , @xmath20=1 , all others zero ) .",
    "these couplings were selected to give @xmath188 , as the ground states previously encountered had a @xmath49 either along the @xmath189 direction or on the edges of the brillouin zone . for a given @xmath190 , the value of @xmath4 is determined by : @xmath191 we particularly studied the @xmath192 case .",
    "( note that iterative minimization necessarily probes commensurate states , due to our boundary conditions . )",
    "this corresponds to @xmath193 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : j2-q - doubletwist ] ) .",
    "the double twist state is , to good approximation , composed solely of @xmath194 modes ( for normalization , there will necessarily be other wave - vectors , but these have relatively small amplitudes ) . unlike previous states , each sublattice has nonzero contributions from all @xmath194 wavevectors , rather than a subset .",
    "the weight of each sublattice in a given @xmath194 mode differs between sublattices , approximately in proportion to relative weight in the lt optimal mode with a similar @xmath49 .",
    "the spatial variation produced by this combination of modes is complicated .",
    "there is a stacking axis in real space , which we take to be @xmath195 without loss of generality .",
    "spin space is characterized by three orthonormal basis vectors : @xmath48 defines a conic axis , around which the other two basis vectors @xmath88 and @xmath47 rotate as a function of @xmath14 :    [ eq : a - b - basis ] @xmath196    we can parameterize this cartoon of the double twist state as @xmath197 with @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is an arbitrary phase , similarly @xmath200 . note the coordinates @xmath201 in @xmath202 are the actual sites for sublattice @xmath97 , which are half - odd - integers in the @xmath97 component .",
    "thus , addition to the twisting of the basis vectors along the stacking direction , in ( [ eq : a - b - basis ] ) , there are spatial modulations transverse to the stacking direction that appear in the coefficients of @xmath203 and @xmath48 in ( [ eq : doubletwist ] )    while the form described by ( [ eq : doubletwist ] ) is close to what we observe with iterative minimization , it unfortunately does not satisfy normalization : the ground state necessarily contains admixtures of non - optimal modes .",
    "( to satisfy normalization using only the @xmath194 modes would require four - component spins . ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubletwist ] ) , @xmath204 should ideally be the amplitudes ( on the three respective sublattices ) of the lt eigenvector at @xmath205 , while @xmath206 is a weighting factor that reduces the deviations of the spins in ( [ eq : doubletwist ] ) from uniform normalization .",
    "what if we demanded , not normalization of all spins , but only that the mean - squared value of @xmath207 be one in each sublattice ?",
    "since each cosine or sine factor has mean square of 1/2 , and since @xmath208 , we ought then to have @xmath209 . projecting the actual result of iterative minimization onto such modes gave @xmath210 .",
    "also , whereas @xmath211 in the actual lt eigenvectors , we found @xmath212 in the results of iterative minimization .",
    "the double twist state can be viewed as related to the hypothesized transversely - modulated conics or to the cuboctahedral states . in particular , the composition of this state in terms of lt modes is more similar to the cuboctahedral states than to any other configuration .    the lt mode underlying this state , according to ( [ eq : j2-q - doubletwist ] ) , has a continuously variable wavevector as @xmath4 is varied . due to the limitations of iterative minimization with periodic boundary conditions , we have not followed the evolution of the double - twist state",
    "; in particular , we do not know if it becomes incommensurate in both the stacking ( @xmath14 ) direction and the transverse directions .",
    "to understand how the ground states outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : coplane],[sec : cuboc ] , [ sec : conic ] , and [ sec : doubletwist ] fit together , it is necessary to examine the phase diagrams of the octahedral and chain lattices .",
    "a series of representative cuts through the phase diagrams for both lattices gives us a general sense of their topology , and specifically in what regions non - coplanar states are stabilized .    of course , rescaling the couplings by any positive factor gives an identical ground state ( with energy rescaled by the same factor ) .",
    "therefore we present the phase diagrams in rescaled coordinates , normally @xmath213 ( except when @xmath214 ) .",
    "an important aspect of all the phase diagrams is the classification of the transitions into first - order ( discontinuous ) , encompassed ( continuous ) , or degenerate : the distinction between the last two kinds was explained in sec .",

    "it is labeled in the diagrams by `` @xmath215 '' representing how the number of parameters ( needed to label the states ) scales with system size .      in the octahedral lattice",
    "we are fortunate in that most kinds of states have energies that can be written exactly as a linear combination of couplings ( given in table  [ tab : o - states ]  @xcite ) ; the phase boundaries between such phases are simply the lines ( more exactly hyperplanes ) where the two energy functions are equal .",
    "most other phase boundaries are handled analytically , e.g. the helimagnetic state and its `` encompassed '' ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states . the only phase boundary _ not _ determined analytically from a variational form was the double - twist state , for which we do not have an exact variational form ; in this case the boundary was approximation by the lt phase boundary .",

    "our work is an example of a `` materials by design '' philosophy , whereby materials are tailored ",
    "e.g. by adjusting their chemical content  to have a combination of interactions leading to a desired state .      our basic recipe to determine the ground state of a non - bravais lattice was a two - step process ( sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] ) .",
    "first , an approximate ground state configuration is generated through iterative optimization ( sec .",
    "[ sec : iter - min ] ) of a lattice , starting from a random initial spin configuration . from this result ,",
    "an idealized spin configuration is created . the idealized formulation ,",
    "if it has parameters undetermined by symmetry , is then used variationally optimize the heisenberg hamiltonian ( sec .",
    "[ sec : var ] ) , yielding also the energy per site as a function of parameters .",
    "when this has been carried out for each candidate phase , a phase diagram ( sec .  [ sec : phase ] ) can be generated .",
    "we refined the basic recipe further using three additional concepts or tricks .",
    "first , although the eigenmodes of the coupling matrix do not ( in the non - bravais case ) automatically lead us to the ground state , they sometimes do work and are always a useful guide .",
    "second , if the magnetic structure is layered , the three - dimensional octahedral lattice can be mapped to various ( non bravais ) one - dimensional lattices ; such `` chain '' lattices are much more tractable than the cuboctahedral one , but they still support non - coplanar states .",
    "third , we applied perturbation analysis to find second - order phase boundaries ( especially in combination with variational optimization , but also in the luttinger - tisza fourier analysis ) .",
    "namely , when a ground state could not be written exactly , but emerges as an instability of a closely related state  e.g. a helimagnetic phase out of the ferromagnetic one  we can expand around the latter state and solve for the couplings at which it goes unstable .",
    "the insufficiency of finding regions with the correct @xmath49 for the purpose of stabilizing a targeted magnetic structures is an important caveat for the lt approach .",
    "there are some combinations of modes which _ can not _ be stabilized by _ any _ set of pairwise interactions .",
    "that is , we can make them be optimal modes , but only if they are part of a degenerate family that includes other optimal lt modes that are unrelated by symmetry .",
    "we identified two categories of non - coplanar arrangements ( which could be defined for more general lattices than the octahedral one ) .",
    "first , there are the commensurate three-@xmath52 states , exemplified here by the highly symmetric `` cuboctabedral '' spin state ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cuboc ] ) .",
    "a second general class includes several varieties of incommensurate `` conic spiral '' ( sec .",
    "[ sec : conic ] ) .",
    "the commensurate three-@xmath52 states were found for both short and long range couplings ( i.e. @xmath6 s limited to no more than second - nearest neighbors or extending beyond second - nearest neighbors ) , while incommensurate conic spirals were possible for our lattice only when there are some @xmath6 s beyond the second neighbors .",
    "the conic spirals came in `` alternating '' or `` asymmetric '' subclasses ( stable in different parts of @xmath51 parameter space ) according to whether the spin components along the rotation axis were the same in each layer or alternated .",
    "this suggested that an additional subclass should exist , the `` transversely modulated conic spiral '' , which is non - uniform in each layer .",
    "in addition , we came across a `` double - twist '' ground state of high ( but not cubic ) symmetry , which has some commonalities with the cuboctahedral state but is probably best classified as a transverse - modulated conic spiral ( sec .",
    "[ sec : doubletwist ] ) .",
    "the conic spiral states were found to be a function of one spatial coordinate , allowing the more involved octahedral lattice to be mapped to the 1d chain lattice while preserving the ground state ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] ) .",
    "while this mapping is not a generic property of ground states in the octahedral lattice , it dramatically simplifies the analysis .",
    "moreover , the transformation provides a guide for the couplings required to stabilize the conic spiral states in the octahedral lattice .    note that while the presence of inequivalent sublattices was necessary for the stabilization of non - coplanar states in the one - dimensional chain lattice , it is not so in higher dimensions .",
    "our octahedral - lattice couplings explicitly treat all sites equivalently ; non - coplanar states emerge either when it divides into unequal layers , that map to the chain lattice , or when it supports three - dimensional spin patterns not mappable to a chain lattice .",
    "the most dramatic examples when the chain lattice fails to represent the ground state in the octahedral lattice are the cuboctahedral states , for which there is no distinguished direction of variation ( or stacking vector )      one might have expected noncoplanar ground states to be generic ( in the non - bravais case , when they are possible at all ) but in fact they were seen in only a small portion of our parameter space ( sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] ) .",
    "in fact , non - coplanar phases typically appeared in the phase diagram as `` bridges '' intermediate between simpler phases ; there are two scenarios of bridging , as formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec : bridging ] .",
    "first , typically along the phase boundary between two simple commensurate phases , one finds families of continuously degenerate states .",
    "usually , this infinite family includes coplanar states but the generic member is non - coplanar ; appropriate tuning of the couplings ( e.g. including further neighbors ) can select particular non - coplanar states in different ways .",
    "however , since the non - coplanar phase was limited ( in the first - order description ) to the ( measure zero ) boundaries between planar states , it naturally occupies only in a small region of the extended parameter space .",
    "indeed , the non - coplanar states we found in the octahedral lattice either occurred in small wedges , e.g. the cuboctahedral or double - twist states or were only observed as accidental instances of the degenerate family in cases where the degeneracy can not be broken ( within the parameter space we took as the scope of this paper ) , e.g. the asymmetric conic states .",
    "second , there are the `` encompassing states '' .",
    "such states become qualitatively different as a free parameter reaches some limiting value ( a canonical example is the collinear ferromagnet as a limiting case of planar spirals . ) in the chain lattice , we often observed phase boundaries between two states that did not encompass each other ; by tuning the couplings , it was sometimes possible to stabilize a third state which encompassed the original two , so the original first - order transition is converted to two successive second - order transitions with the encompassing state in the middle .",
    "this is the means by which conic spiral states are stabilized in the chain lattice .",
    "recently , a framework was proposed with a motivation similar to ours , the `` regular states ''  @xcite which have a magnetic symmetry such that all sites symmetry - equivalent .",
    "the cuboctahedral state is an example .",
    "however , this is neither necessary nor sufficient for our own problem , to find all kinds of non - coplanar states : most of those , e.g. the double - twist state , are not regular , and conversely certain non - coplanar regular states are not stabilized by bilinear exchange interactions alone .",
    "now we consider moving beyond the somewhat artificial octahedral lattice .",
    "we examine the necessary conditions for non - coplanar spin configurations analogous to the two main classes we discovered ( cuboctahedral and conic spiral ) .",
    "can our results be applied to other lattices , such as the pyrochlore lattice ?",
    "the cuboctahedral states seem highly specific to the octahedral lattice , since they possess the same symmetries as the lattice . on the other hand , the lt construction ( each sublattice using different combinations of lt modes , the combinations being related by rotational symmetry of the different sublattices ) seems fairly generic . a general name for states like",
    "the cuboctahedral state might be `` commensurate triple - q state '' , referring to its content of lt modes .",
    "can such states be found in other lattices , or are there others in the octahedral lattice ?",
    "one answer requires that the hypothetical generalized state enjoys the full symmetry of the lattice , as the cuboctahedral state does .",
    "then the number of site classes must be a multiple of the number of spin components , i.e. of three . that will not work for the pyrochlore lattice , in which there are _ four _ site classes associated with ( 111 ) directions .",
    "however , it might work in the half - garnet lattice , which has _",
    "site classes associated with ( 110 ) directions .",
    "a second , more systematic way to answer question follows the lt approach of sec .",
    "[ sec : cuboc - lt ] .",
    "the state must be a linear combination of three modes ",
    "one for each component of spin . for the state to enjoy the full lattice symmetry",
    ", these must be the complete star of symmetry - related modes , thus it must have a threefold multiplicity .",
    "furthermore , each mode must be real ( otherwise one mode requires two spin components ) ; that happens only if the wavevector is half a reciprocal lattice vector , i.e. is at the center of one of the brillouin zone s faces .",
    "however , sec .  [ sec : cuboc - no ] gave a cautionary example : finding such modes is not _",
    "sufficient _ , because it might give a state with decoupled sublattices , so that the cuboctahedral state would merely be one undistinguished configuration in a continuous manifold of degenerate states that even includes collinear states .",
    "we can , in fact , borrow a notion from section  [ sec : mapping ] to guess when this happens : mapping to a chain lattice , now applied to lt modes rather than to spin structures .",
    "the wavevector of one mode defines a set of planes , and thus a way of projecting both the sites and the mode onto a one - dimensional chain lattice . on the chain lattice , in order that the mode be real , the wavevector must be @xmath221 . if all the site planes were equivalent , the chain lattice is a bravais lattice and the mode must be a plane wave ; with @xmath222 , it is easy to see we get a decoupled pattern , namely @xmath223 . in the octahedral lattice ,",
    "the @xmath224 modes have a threefold degeneracy and also correspond to a non - equivalent set of stacked planes , giving a cuboctahedral state , whereas the threefold degenerate @xmath224 modes have equivalent stacked planes and give decoupled states . in the pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "the @xmath225 modes have a threefold multiplicity but have equivalent stacked planes ; on the other hand , the @xmath226 modes have inequivalent stacked planes but their multiplicity is fourfold .",
    "thus , in the pyrochlore case this path does not lead us to a cuboctahedral state .    the third way to answer",
    "this question is via the cluster constuction of sec .",
    "[ sec : cuboc - cages ] , in which the lattice was decomposed into cuboctahedral cages . indeed",
    ", some other lattices consist of a union of roughly spherical `` cage '' clusters : e.g. , in the cr@xmath11si - type or `` a15 '' structure , the majority atoms form cages in the form of distorted icosahedra .",
    "furthermore , couplings can certainly be chosen such that the spin ground state of a cluster forms a the same polyhedron as the cluster itself .    however , our ground - state construction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cuboc - cages ] ) demanded that the spin configurations in adjacent cages be related by a _ reflection _ in spin space .",
    "thus the cages alternate between proper and improper rotations of a reference configuration . that is possible only if the cage centers form a _",
    "bipartite _ lattice , which is not true for the a15 majority - atom cage centers .",
    "( they form a bcc lattice with first- and second - neighbor links . )",
    "long ago , kaplan and collaborators studied _ doubly _ magnetic spinels , and identified a ( noncoplanar ) `` ferrimagnetic spiral '' configuration arising from exchange interactions ( a spiral of this sort is responsible for multiferroic properties of cocr@xmath227o@xmath228  @xcite .",
    "this is actually a kind of double spiral ( each magnetic species accounting for one of the spirals ) .",
    "notice that we could map that structure to a chain , too , and that chain would have two inequivalent sites , which we point out is a precondition for developing a noncoplanar state .    for a mapping to the 1d chain lattice to provide a non - coplanar state",
    ", the mapped sites must be inequivalent by translation ; if not , the chain lattice is a bravais lattice and must have ( at most ) a coplanar spiral state .",
    "this in turn depends on having _ unequal _ layers in the three - dimensional lattice , which is is impossible in the bravais case , but inequivalent layers can emerge from a non - bravais lattice with fully symmetric couplings .",
    "thus , as we worked out in sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] , a @xmath147 stacking in the octahedral lattice has twice as many sites on @xmath12 and @xmath13 bonds , constituting one kind of layer , as there are sites on @xmath14 bonds , constituting the other kind .",
    "the stacking direction is one in which the wavevector is incommensurate , and so we may seek out parameter sets for which @xmath49 goes incommensurate in a desired direction .",
    "however , this is no guarantee that the actual ground state is stacked , since it might be better energetically to combine these modes ( or ones nearby in @xmath34-space ) in a quite different way .",
    "thus , although we found some optimal @xmath49 wavevectors in directions other than @xmath147 , they were never the basis of a stacked spiral .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice is undoubtedly the most prominent non - bravais lattice that is likely to have non - coplanar states , and was a major motivation for the methods we developed in this paper for the more tractable octahedral lattice .",

    "( it is not sufficient because the actual ground state could feature additional modes or modes merely in the neighborhood of @xmath49 . )",
    "the lt matrix elements @xmath231 and eigenvalues @xmath232 are functions of wavevector @xmath34 .",
    "imagine that @xmath233 is a point of high symmetry in the zone so as to be a stationary point for @xmath232 . for some parameter sets , we know , it is a minimum and in fact optimal ; whereas for some other parameter sets , we imagine , it is only a saddle point , and the minimum occurs at some nearby wavevector of lower symmetry .",
    "one first writes a taylor expansion of the lt matrix in powers of @xmath234 . using standard techniques ( formally identical to those used for eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation )",
    "it is straightforward to write a perturbation expansion for @xmath232 in powers of @xmath235 .",
    "inspection then shows where this stops being positive definite . since the lt matrix elements are bounded , so are the eigenvalues @xmath232 .",
    "so if the mode at @xmath233 goes unstable at quadratic order in @xmath235 , there must be higher - order positive terms in the expansion .",
    "thus the single local minimum of @xmath232 bifurcates in some fashion .",
    "the corresponding spin state can not be a commensurate spiral , but it might be representable in the framework of planar stackings ( sec .  [",

    "this technique was used , for example , to analyze how the @xmath236 wavevector is destabilized in the lt phase diagram .",
    "simulations had found degenerate antiferromagnetic orderings at that wavevector ; if an incommensurate wavevector of form @xmath237 had been stabilized , this might have been the basis of a non - coplanar spiral stacked in the @xmath238 direction .          here",
    "@xmath240 in ( [ eq : lt - matrix - diag ] ) means the indices other than @xmath97 , similarly @xmath241 in ( [ eq : lt - matrix - offdiag ] ) is the index other than @xmath242 .",

    "this is not say that it avoids the disconnect between the state being perturbed and the actual ground state , if the perturbed state does not encompass the true ground state then the disconnect is required .",
    "however , this method does allow us to consider states composed of multiple lt wave - vectors .    in the octahedral lattice ,",
    "most of the ground state types we encountered  even the noncollinear ones  are essentially built using a single `` star '' of symmetry - related ordering wave - vectors .",
    "therefore , for the octahedral lattice , the actual phase diagram mostly reflects the lt phase diagram and it is preferable to find phase boundaries via the lt perturbation method illustrated above in sec .",
    "[ sec : pert - lt ] . for the chain lattice ,",
    "however , the ground state is typically characterized by several wave - vectors .",
    "such multi - lt wave - vectors are all parametrized by some form of `` conic spirals , '' a mix of a planar spiral using the wavevector @xmath249 and a deviation along the wavevector @xmath250 where @xmath251 is either integer or half - integer ( since the chain lattice is 1d , the wave - vectors are as well ) . within a range of parameter space @xmath116 through @xmath252 ( @xmath253 and higher all 0 )",
    ", these conic spirals are the most general form of ground state , making the problem of finding the ground state amenable to variational methods .    as an illustration of determining the ground state by variational methods , we consider the problem of finding the phase boundaries for the `` alternating conic '' @xmath254 .",
    "the spin configurations in the lattice are parametrized by eq.([eq : altconic ] ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we take the odd sites to be the ones with planar spins .",
    "a symmetry relates the states ( [ eq : altconic ] ) to the other family of alternating conic configurations in which even and odd sites have swapped roles , if one also swaps in parameter space @xmath255 .    up to interaction @xmath119 , the energy per unit cell",
    "is @xmath256 setting @xmath257 to minimize ( [ eq : e - alt - conic ] ) , we see that the optimal angle @xmath258 , is given by @xmath259 notice the symmetry under reversing the signs of @xmath116 and @xmath118 and @xmath260 .",
    "of course , a necessary condition is that the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : alpha - alt - conic ] ) lies in @xmath261 ( recall that @xmath262 by definition ) , otherwise @xmath263 is pinned to 0 or @xmath264 , which would be a planar spiral ( or possibly a collinear state , depending on the value of @xmath265 ) .    plugging ( [ eq : alpha - alt - conic ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - alt - conic ] ) leaves @xmath266 as the only variational parameter : [ eq : e - alt - conic - psi ] @xmath267 if we drop the secondary couplings equation ( [ eq : e - alt - conic - psi ] ) reduces to @xmath268 since ( [ e - alt - conic - simple ] ) is linear in @xmath269 , its ground state given by @xmath270 with @xmath271 integer .",
    "if @xmath271 is odd , then eq.[e - alt - conic - simple ] breaks down , since eq.([eq : alpha - alt - conic ] ) is singular .",
    "what actually occurs here is that the sublattices have adopted an antiferromagnetic structure , decoupling the sublattices .",
    "because the sublattices are decoupled , @xmath27 is arbitrary ( representing the freedom the decoupled sublattices to rotate relative to each other ) .",
    "the energy for such a configuration is @xmath272 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath271 is even , then the ground state is a splayed state ( assuming that @xmath273 ) that means a commensurate , _ planar _ state ( using the @xmath274 plane , or collinear if @xmath263 is trivial ) .",
    "thus , with only primary couplings , even though the two sublattices are inequivalent , we _ can not _ obtain a non - coplanar spiral .",
    "when we turn on ( not too large ) secondary couplings , those commensurate states will remain stable out to the critical coupling , at which the optimal wavevector bifurcates . therefore we expand ( [ eq : e - alt - conic - psi ] ) in powers of @xmath275 about both kinds of stationary point  @xcite to find :      @xmath277 ^ 2}{j_2 - 4j_4 }             + j_2'-j_4'-j_2-j_4 + \\\\       &      \\bigg(4\\frac{j_1 - 3j_3}{j_2 - 4j_4 } j_3 +              2[\\frac{j_1 - 3j_3}{j_2 - 4j_4}]^2 j_4-              2j_2'+8j_4'\\bigg )             \\delta^2              \\end{split}\\ ] ]      [ eq : e - alt - conic - unstable ] @xmath279 } { j_2}j_3          + j_2'+4j_4 '   \\\\ & e_{\\frac{\\pi}{2 } } : 0   \\ge &        [ \\frac{j_1 - 3j_3}{j_2 - 4j_4}]^2j_4          + 2\\frac{j_1 - 3j_3 } { j_2 - 4j_4}j_3           -j_2'+4j_4 '           \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        a.yoshimori , j. phys .",
