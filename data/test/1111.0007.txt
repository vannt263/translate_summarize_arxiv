    "a century ago , the study of variable stars was a leading area of astronomy . with the increasing availability of large format optical detectors and inexpensive high speed computing this sub - field ,",
    "as witnessed by projects such as asas , ogle , catalina sky survey , the palomar transient factory , panstarss and skymapper , is making a come - back .",
    "radio astronomy appears to be poised for a similar growth . at meter wavelengths ,",
    "commercially available signal processing chips make it feasible to image the entire primary beam of a dipole or a cluster of dipoles .",
    "these technological innovations lie at the heart of lofar @xcite , mwa @xcite and lwa @xcite . at centimeter wavelengths the `` large number , small diameter '' ( lnsd ) array approach ( made possible by inexpensive signal processing , advances in commercial rf technology , innovative ideas in the design of small diameter telescopes and phased array focal planes ) has now been demonstrated to be a cost effective method of building high speed mapping machines @xcite .",

    "the first is the duration of the basic phenomenon ( shorter than or greater than a few seconds ) .",
    "the second is their location ( within the galaxy or extra - galactic ) . roughly speaking the duration maps to coherent versus incoherent emission and the location to repeated versus cataclysmic events .",
    "pulsars and related phenomenon ( giant pulses , nulling pulsars , erratic pulsars , rotating radio transients , and magnetars ) are the dominant category of short duration radio transients at meter and centimeter wavelengths .",
    "there are no secure examples of short duration radio transients that are located beyond the local group . flare stars and associated phenomena are prime examples of long duration radio transients of galactic origin .",
    "the focus of this paper is long duration transients of extra - galactic origin .",
    "known examples in this group are supernovae @xcite and gamma - ray burst afterglows @xcite . in both cases , the radio emission arises as the fast moving debris interacts with the circumstellar matter . in table",
    "[ tab : listoftrans ] we summarize the areal density of radio - emitting supernovae ( including the sub - classes ) and grb afterglows .",
    "note the areal density of `` live transients '' ( transients present at any given instant of time ) of both supernovae and grb afterglows is less than 0.05 per square degree .    in 2007 ,",
    "bower et al .",
    "[ hereafter , b07 ] reported on the analysis of a single field observed every week as a part of the very large array ( vla ) calibration program . the observations were conducted at 4.8ghz and 8.4ghz and lasted 22 years .",
    "the 944 epochs and the weekly cadence makes this data set a most valuable set to probe the decimeter band for long duration transients at the sub - millijansky level . these authors reported the discovery of eight transients found in only one epoch ( hereafter `` single - epoch '' ; duration , 20minutes @xmath6 1week ) and two transients found in rolling 2-month searches ( hereafter , `` multi - epoch '' sources ) .",
    "deep observations towards these sources were undertaken at optical , near - ir and x - ray bands .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the b07 sources is an absence of optical and near - ir counterparts , despite deep searches ( b07 ; @xcite ) . as noted by @xcite all extra - galactic transients (",
    "regardless of the band at which the transient was discovered ) have detectable optical counterparts , namely , their host galaxies .",
    "furthermore , remarkably the areal density of transients live at any given time was estimated to be 1.5deg@xmath7 ( @xmath8mjy ) .",
    "this density exceeds that of all other known radio transient source populations by an order of magnitude ( or more ) ; see table  [ tab : listoftrans ] .",
    "@xcite thus argued that the absence of an optical counterpart means that b07 transients have to be repeating sources of galactic origin , and proposed that b07 transients are old neutron stars ( which naturally satisfy the requirement of being optically almost invisible ) .",
    "given that the search for transient and strong variables is one of the primary motivators for the next generation radio facilities ( described earlier ) it is important to critically investigate the b07 transients since this class nominally dominates over all other known classes of radio transients ( see table  [ tab : listoftrans ] ) .",
    "to this end , here we report on a re - analysis of the original data of b07 (  [ sec : obsreana ] ,  [ sec : findings ] ) and revisit the transient reported by @xcite (  [ sec : othersurveys ] ) . in  [ sec : lognlogs ] we present an update of the expected rate of radio transients . in  [ sec : futuresurveys ] we discuss these rates in relation to future synoptic radio imaging surveys and conclude .",
    "the data used by b07 arose from a calibrator program carried out during the period 19832005 .",
    "all observations were made in the standard continuum mode with 100mhz of total bandwidth in each of two adjacent 50-mhz bands ( ifs ) at center frequencies of 5ghz and 8.4ghz and in both hands of circular polarization .",
    "see b07 for more details about the full data - set .    for the re - analysis we selected , from the archive , only the raw data relevant to the transients reported in b07 .",
    "this means the eight epochs from which the single - epoch transients were first found and the 3 + 8 data sets from which the two multi - epoch transients were found .",
    "data were taken at other radio frequencies in about half of the cases .",
    "some details of the single epoch and two - month transients can be found in table  [ tab : listoffields ] ) .    for the re - analysis we used aips @xcite .",
    "the data reduction and imaging followed the same path used by b07 with a small exception . b07 employed aips for the flagging and analysis of the single - epoch transients , and used the _ miriad _ package @xcite for imaging the two - month averages .",
    "we endeavored to make the calibration and the flagging of uv data ( aips task ` tvflg ` ) data for each epoch as uniform way . following these steps we ran each raw visibility data set through the vla pipeline ( ` vlarun ` ) .",
    "no flux density calibrator was observed during any epoch of these test observations . following b07 ,",
    "the flux density of the phase calibrator ( b1803 + 784 ) was fixed to be 2.2jy ( 5ghz ) and 2.8jy ( 8.4ghz ) .",
    "for those epochs with 22ghz and 1.4ghz observations the flux density of the phase calibrator was taken to be 3jy and 2jy , respectively .",
    "it is evident from the strong variations in the radio light curves for b1803 + 784 that these mean values are only approximate .",
    "our reinvestigation confirm that at least during the period 19811999 the variation was less than 15% .",
    "fortunately , an accurate flux density scale is not crucial for our analysis since we report results in terms of the signal - to - noise .",
    "following b07 we applied a gaussian weighting to the visibility data in order to limit the effects of bandwidth smearing .",
    "this was done by applying a 150-k@xmath9 taper to all visibility data prior to imaging ( ` imagr ` ) . for each field",
    "we required that a source be present in both frequency bands ( ifs ) with similar flux densities and with similar positions .",
    "images were made with extra large fields - of - view .",
    "the wide field - of - view is necessary to reduce the effect of side - lobes that can mimic sources in narrow fields .",
    "these final analysis images had a size of about 40-arcmin at 5ghz data and 27-arcmin at 8.4ghz .",
    "for guidance , the full - width at half power for vla antennas is 45-arcmin/@xmath10(ghz ) , or 9.3-arcmin at 5ghz and 4.3-arcmin for 8.4ghz .",
    "measurements of the vla beam power response beyond the first null are given in @xcite , while the polynomial coefficients needed to correct for the primary beam attenuation can be found in the aips task ` pbcor ` .",
    "we do note that these corrections are uncertain for large angular distances from the beam center .",
    "all data were taken in the b1950 coordinate system .",
    "we stayed in the b1950 system throughout calibration and imaging .",

    "the discrepancy with respect to the results reported in b07 concerned us and so another author ( gb ) reanalyzed these fields .",
    "some of the discrepancies arise from uv data flagging but even when the same flagging is used different snr algorithms yield measures which differ by 1 to 1.5@xmath11 .",

    "there is an elongated source at this position with a peak flux density of @xmath53jy ( using natural weighting ) .",
    "there is some indication that the source is extended since the integrated flux density is about twice the peak flux density .",

    "these data were taken in the bna array with an integration time of 3 1/3 s and a 50-mhz bandwidth . in this observing configuration , the effects of temporal smearing with this dump time will likely reduce the peak flux density by only a few percent .",
    "however , chromatic aberration is expected to be larger with the effect of smearing a point source along the radial direction @xcite .",
    "accounting for the bandwidth effect , we measure a peak flux density of @xmath54mjy ( snr=5.7 ) .",
    "next , due to the uncertainty about the form of the primary response function beyond the 20% point ( aips task pbcor ) , we only know that the peak flux of rt19970205 lies in the range of 2.94.4mjy . as noted above the source is likely extended and this may account for the variation in snr ( from @xmath55 to 7.6 ) .",
    "@xcite presented a survey for 5ghz radio transients at low galactic latitudes .",
    "most of the data were reduced in near - real time ( 2hr delay ) and transient candidates were followed up with radio , visible light and x - ray instruments .",
    "the authors reported a single transient candidate , j@xmath56 with a peak specific flux of @xmath57mjy ( 5.8@xmath11 ) and with no obvious optical counterpart .",
    "we have re - analyzed this data set and confirm that the snr is 5.8 . considering that the search resulted from inspecting @xmath58 independent beams (  [ sec : numberindependentbeams ] ) and assuming gaussian statistics , we find that the probability of the highest event found in these many independent beams is attributable to chance or noise is 3.6% ( see  [ sec : a ] ) .",
    "therefore , we advocate that this candidate is not a real event .",
    "as noted in  [ sec : introduction ] the ten transients reported in b07 were remarkable for their apparent abundance ( 1.5 per square degree , at any given epoch ) _ and _ the lack of quiescent optical counterparts . in ",
    "[ sec : findings ] we found that five of the b07 transients are artifacts arising out of ( rare ) data acquisition problems or imaging artifacts ( see table  [ tab : listoffields ] ) .",
    "we find that the 2-month transient rt20010331 is not well detected .",
    "we argue that the single transient reported by @xcite is also not a robust detection .",

    "b07 addressed this problem by requiring that the probability of a false detection ( pfd ) in an individual epoch was constant and less than @xmath65 where @xmath65 is the total number of images . with this approach ,",
    "the expectation number of false detections is 1 for the entire survey . applying the b07 method we find the following pfds : rt19920826 ( log(pfd)=@xmath66 ) ; rt19970205 ( @xmath67 ) ; rt19970528 ( @xmath68 ) ; rt19990504 ( @xmath69 ) . with this more refined approach",
    "only rt19920826 and 19990504 survive .",
    "however , for reasons discussed in  [ sec : rt19990504 ] we have misgivings about rt1990504 .",
    "an entirely different approach ( and in some ways orthogonal to the above snr based approach ) is to look at the angular distribution of the transient sources with respect to the primary axis .",
    "basic interferometry theory informs us that the dirty image is simply the fourier transform of the visibility data .",
    "as such the radiometric noise in the dirty image should be independent of the angular offset from the phase center .",
    "in contrast , the point source sensitivity decreases as one goes away from the pointing center and this is governed by the primary beam response ( assuming that the spectral resolution of the survey is high enough that the delay beam is larger than the primary beam ) .",
    "thus , once the minimum snr for detection is fixed , cosmic sources should be concentrated towards the pointing direction whereas noise spikes ( masquerading as threshold point sources ) should be uniformly distributed .    in  [ sec : primarybeam ] we derive the expected distribution of cosmic sources as a function of the angular offset . in figure",
    "[ fig : primarybeampoints ] we plot the expected cumulative distribution and also the angular offset of the four sources which are not artifacts but whose snr seems to be under dispute , namely rt19920826 (  [ sec : rt19920826 ] ) , rt19970205 (  [ sec : rt19970205 ] ) , rt19970528 (  [ sec : rt19970528 ] ) and rt19990504 (  [ sec : rt19990504 ] ) .",
    "from this figure one can see that only rt19920826 lies in the expected region whereas the remaining three are collectively improbable .    .",
    "the sources are represented by dots and are ( from left to right ) : rt19920826 , rt19970528 , rt19970205 , and rt19990504 .",
    "the points are deliberately placed at cumulative probability of 1% .",
    "rt19920826 is firmly within the region where one naturally expects cosmic sources.,width=259 ]    in summary , two different statistical tests , one based on snr and the other making use of the spatial signature provided by the primary beam , suggest that of the remaining four sources detected at threshold , only one , namely , rt19920826 is a good detection .",
    "thus a simple interpretation of our re - analysis is that the rate of b07 transients is considerably lower than that reported by b07 , perhaps an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we acknowledge that the discrepancy between the analysis presented in b07 and the analysis presented here ( and re - investigated ) is disturbing . in the previous section (  [ sec : remainingfourtransients ] )",
    "we investigate the reasons for the discrepancy in the snrs and variously find possible and plausible causes : flagging of data , the choice of data reduction package ( aips versus _ miriad _ ) and the specific method used to compute snrs .",
    "however , none of these explanations are satisfactory .",
    "we are continuing this investigation but at the present time we consider this topic to beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "in contrast , the sources which we find as artifacts have ready explanations ( see table  [ tab : listoffields ] ) .",
    "one source is a result of the file header containing a pointing direction of the previous pointing .",
    "another is due to a systematic associated with local signals ( rfi ) .",
    "these signals do not have the natural fringe rate of cosmic sources and appear as candidates close to the phase center .",
    "two are side - lobes of a stronger sources . suffice to say that such rare errors will be found if one inspects sufficiently large number of beams !",
    "in figure  [ fig : rates ] we plot the areal densities of three known transients ( sn1998bw - like , type - ii rsn and swift j1644 + 57-like ) and that of two expected classes ( ns - ns mergers and orphan afterglows of long duration grbs ) of transients .",
    "the areal density of these five classes is also summarized in table  [ tab : listoftrans ] .",
    "we briefly discuss each of these five classes of transients below .",
    "the traditional extra - galactic radio transients are type ii radio supernovae .",
    "the rate that we present here is based on the single radio sn detected in a blind radio survey by @xcite and it agrees with an independent estimate by @xcite . as illustrated by the example presented in @xcite , the main advantage in the search for radio sne in a blind survey is the unique view that it provides to the otherwise hidden population of heavily obscured sne .",
    "the observed rate of other types of radio sne ( e.g. ordinary type ib / c sne ) are considerably lower than that of type ii supernovae and are not discussed further .",
    "radio emission is expected from both classical long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as well as the more abundant but less luminous grbs exemplified by grb980425 associated with the energetic sn ic supernova , sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "the radio emission is far brighter than that of ordinary core collapse sn ( ii , ib , ic ) and the increased volume makes up for the intrinsically smaller birth rate .",
    "the recent discovery of the energetic supernova sn2009bb @xcite demonstrates that radio surveys can find such sources without resorting to high energy ( gamma - ray ) missions .",
    "@xcite estimated the number of afterglows from classical grbs and whose explosion axis is directed away from us ( `` orphan '' afterglows ) .",
    "the expected rate depends strongly on the poorly constrained @xmath70-ray beaming . on one hand",
    "this makes any rate prediction uncertain . on the other hand",
    ", even a non - detection by the kind of survey that we discuss below will provide an independent and unique constraint on the average opening angle of long gamma - ray bursts , their true rate and total energy output @xcite . the areal density in figure  [ fig : rates ]",
    "is derived using a typical opening angle of 10 degrees .    a surprising and",
    "apparently an important development in the field of radio transients took place just this year with the discovery of a radio transient associated with the nucleus of a modest size galaxy .",
    "the source , swiftj1644 + 57 was initially detected as a hard x - ray transient @xcite .",
    "subsequent follow up found a bright , compact self - absorbed radio counterpart , localized at the center of a normal galaxy at @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the current view is that swiftj1644 + 57 arose from a relativistic jet produced when a star was tidally disrupted as it passed too close to an otherwise dormant super - massive nuclear black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "shortly , thereafter , a second candidate non - thermal tidal disruption event ( tde ) was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "events such as these give us an opportunity to study the activity of 10@xmath72 - 10@xmath73 m@xmath74 supermassive black holes in otherwise normal galaxies .    the areal density in figure  [ fig : rates ]",
    "is calculated assuming an observed rate of 0.2 @xmath75 swiftj1644 + 57-like events and a gamma - ray beaming factor of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "nominally , swiftj1644",
    "+ 57-like sources appear to be the most frequent extra - galactic transients that will be found in radio transient searches .",
    "we acknowledge that the uncertainty of both the observed rate and the gamma - ray beaming is high and the true rate may be significantly different .",
    "now we come to the most uncertain as well as potentially the most important extra - galactic radio transient  the merger of two neutron stars ( or a black hole and a neutron star ) .",
    "it is generally accepted ( or expected ) that short hard bursts are on - axis explosions of these mergers @xcite . as in long duration grbs",
    ", radio emission is expected by afterglow ( on - axis or orphan ) .",
    "the rates are highly uncertain because there are very few observations of short hard grbs .",
    "thus there still continues to be a debate about the geometry of these explosions ( `` jetted '' or not ) .",
    "next , while the expected radio emission is straightforward to estimate ( subject to the usual parametric uncertainties of the energy fractions of relativistic electrons and magnetic field ) an additional uncertainty is the density of the ambient gas ( which is necessary for the production of the afterglow emission ) .",
    "regardless of the uncertainty whether neutron star mergers are the sources of short grbs or not , a substantial sub- and mildly relativistic outflow is expected to be ejected during the merger . @xcite",
    "estimate radio emission from these outflows .",
    "the areal density in figure  [ fig : rates ] is calculated based on their estimates for ns - ns mergers @xcite ] , assuming a ns - ns merger rate of 300 @xmath77 and that any merger ejects @xmath78 erg of a mildly relativistic outflow .",
    "we note that @xcite suggested that rt19870422 was the radio emission from the remains of a neutron star merger .",
    "however , as noted in ",
    "[ sec : findings ] this source is an artifact .",
    "there are sound reasons to continue the exploration of the dynamic radio sky .",
    "radio searches are an ideal way to discover core - collapse supernovae embedded in or behind dusty regions .",
    "the discovery of sn2009bb shows that large radio searches can find urgently needed additional examples of nearby low luminosity grbs .",
    "next , the many rewards of radio follow up observations of swift1644 + 57 ( accurate localization , energetics , beaming , outflow velocity ) show the tremendous diagnostic power of radio observations of this entirely new class of extragalactic transients .    as exciting as these developments are",
    ", the search for new classes of radio transients has involved several false starts .",
    "the euphoria that followed the discovery of a highly dispersed ( and therefore argued to be of extragalactic origin ) millisecond burst @xcite was rapidly diminished by the discovery of many such bursts , presumably of terrestrial origin @xcite ; but see @xcite .",
    "similarly , a long - duration transient found by @xcite and @xcite was later traced to a glitch in the vla on - line data taking system @xcite , apparently affecting 0.29% of all first survey pointings @xcite .",
    "finally , our re - analysis ( see  [ sec : rt19870422 ] ) shows that the claim of late time radio emission from neutron star coalescence @xcite is premature .",
    "here we focused on the potentially new class of long duration radio transients reported in b07 .",
    "we rule out six of the ten transients and cast doubts on some of the remaining ones .",
    "however , even with one or two survivors the long duration transients of b07 remain of great interest .",
    "first , even with a diminished number of transients the implied areal rate of b07 transients would be comparable to the recently established class of swiftj1644 + 57 transients . however , _ unlike any other long duration radio transient _ ( to wit , supernovae ; active stars ; tidal disruption events ; gamma - ray burst afterglows , beamed or otherwise ) the b07 transients are remarkable for the absence of a quiescent optical counterpart .",
    "the event rt19920826 survives two independent tests . as such it useful to speculate on the origin of this transient .",
    "the absence of an optical ( b07 ) and near ir quiescent source could mean one of two origins .",
    "the event is extra - galactic in origin but the host galaxy is faint enough not to have been detected ( as does happen for a few percent of long duration grb host galaxies ) or that it is offset from a host galaxy ( as in the case for a few short hard bursts ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the event is a galactic neutron star and we have to then appeal to an optically invisible galactic ( neutron star ) population @xcite .",
    "clearly , a new survey which can net a dozen of such sources ( but brighter ! ) would help resolve the origin .",
    "for the galactic hypothesis one expect no quiescent counterpart even at hst sensitivity whereas detectable galaxies , in the majority , are expected for the extra - galactic hypothesis .",
    "there are great gains in the discovery of new classes of radio transients but at the same time the path to true success is littered with false starts or easy speculations .",
    "the way forward must incorporate the lessons learnt from the false starts .",
    "we elaborate on this conclusion below .    to start",
    "with we believe that the field of radio transients ( at least in the decimeter band ) is sufficiently mature that any new survey which just sets an upper limit relative to the known population is of marginal value .",
    "future surveys have to be sufficiently deep and cover large enough sky that success ( i.e. detection of a few to many transients ) is assured . in our opinion , this means that a survey should be designed to find at least one or more swiftj1644 + 57-like transient ( figure  [ fig : rates ] ) .    next , timely and multi - wavelength follow - up is essential .",
    "for example , the transients reported in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have plausible origins as supernovae and swiftj1644 + 57-like sources ( see figure  [ fig : rates ] ) .",
    "however , the lack of timely follow - up or deep multi - wavelength followup of these events preclude us from coming to a definitive conclusion .",
    "finally , the search should be restricted to sources with a high level of significance .",
    "this certainly means paying attention to the large number of beams searched .",
    "however , at low thresholds and with large number of beams ( cf  [ sec : findings ] ) it would be prudent to set thresholds beyond mere statistical considerations . a threshold of 9 or even @xmath79 may be appropriate .",
    "alternatively , an immediate verification of a transient by deeper observation or a confirmation by observations at other wavelengths would allow detection of transients closer to threshold .",
    "we start with a discussion of two recent developments .",
    "@xcite undertook an ambitious program similar in spirit to b07 , namely the investigation of fields surrounding vla calibrators .",
    "sources with duration between 4 and 40d were searched for .",
    "the total integration time was 435hr .",
    "no transient source in the ghz range with flux greater than 8mjy was found .",
    "the authors place an upper limit to the areal density of 0.032deg@xmath7 . assuming @xmath80 scaling this areal density is 4.4deg@xmath7 and is well above the b07 rate .",
    "the first survey imaged the sky in an hexagonal grid , in which each position in the survey footprint was observed on average 34 times @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this fact to construct light curves of sources detected in individual first survey snapshots .",
    "they identified 1627 variable candidates with variability exceeding @xmath81 .",
    "this effort is probably the largest variable and transient survey ever carried out .",
    "one disadvantage of such a survey for transient identification is that the co - added images are not much deeper than a single epoch image .",
    "this make it hard to tell if an apparent transient source is really a transient or just a variable source that exceeded the detection threshold in one of the epochs .",
    "the limitations discussed above lead us to suggest a new evla survey specifically tailored to systematically explore the radio sky . following that we review a far more ambitious survey  the vast key project on askap .",
    "for the discussion below we will adopt the rates summarized in table  [ tab : listoftrans ] .",
    "the rates are specified to a flux density of 0.3mjy and are extrapolated to higher flux densities as n(@xmath82 .",
    "a moderately ambitious survey with the evla can result in great progress .",
    "this survey has two virtues .",
    "one , the evla offers excellent spatial resolution .",
    "next , the evla is fully commissioned and is working to specifications .",
    "specifically consider a 100 square degree survey undertaken in the 24ghz band .",
    "an integration time of 85s results in a sensitivity of 0.3mjy ( 10-@xmath11 ) .",
    "a single epoch covering 100 square degrees would require 50 hours .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : phase ] ( taken from table  [ tab : listoftrans ] ) such a survey would have to explore a variety of time scales to probe the emerging classes of transient .",
    "fifteen epochs could reasonably cover the range of a week to years .",
    "noting the great importance of multi - wavelength imaging data , such a survey would sensibly focus on regions of sky where considerable multi - wavelength data ( including radio ) exists .",
    "one such region is , for example , the sdss equatorial stripe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high instantaneous sensitivity of the evla makes rapid follow up of newly transients possible .",
    "after the first four epochs the reference images will be twice as deep as the survey field .",
    "a single new epoch would then yield about ten swiftj1644 + 57-like sources and four supernovae .",
    "ten such images may find a new example of an sn1998bw - like event , several clear examples of orphan afterglows and have an excellent chance of finding the first examples of neutron star mergers .",
    "we note that these different classes of objects have different characteristics , both in duration ( figure  [ fig : phase ] ) and also in host magnitudes and location with respect to host galaxy .",
    "therefore , it is possible to distinguish between different types of objects .    as note",
    "earlier , rapid verification of a transient ( either by additional and deeper radio observations or observations at other wavelengths ) can reduce the requirement for a high detection threshold .",
    "this would then require close rapid reduction ",
    "well within the reach of modern computers .",
    "the variable &  slow transient ( vast ) is an approved key project of askap .",
    "the vast - wide survey aims to survey in the 1.2ghz band about 10,000 square degrees every day for 2 years . with 40-s integrations",
    "the expected single - epoch rms is 0.5mjy ( vast memo#1 ) .",
    "since the survey is planned to be undertaken daily the reference image will be built up quite rapidly .",
    "a comparison of data obtained at a new epoch when compared with the built - up reference image can be expected to detect about six swiftj1644 + 57-like sources .",
    "type ii sn and swiftj1644 + 57-like sources are relatively long lived and",
    "so one could consider averaging the daily images ( to say 10 days ) .",
    "the resulting summed data has a sensitivity of 0.16mjy .",
    "the expected number of transients per such summed image is nominally 32 ( type ii sn ) , 82 ( swiftj1644 + 57 ) , 8 ( orphan afterglows ) and 4 ( neutron star coalescences ) .    to sum up , the dynamic radio sky remains a rich area for exploration .",
    "based on what we know about the areal rates for the _ known _ transient sources , future synoptic radio imaging surveys are expected to yield substantial numbers of exotic transients .",
    "such surveys will also provide the definitive test for the b07 population .",

    "<S> the remaining sources have lower signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) than initially reported by 1 to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this lowering of snr matters greatly since the sources are at the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we are unable to decisively account for the differences . by two orthogonal criteria one source appears to be a good detection . </S>",
    "<S> thus the rate of long duration radio transients without optical counterparts is , at best , comparable to that of the class of recently discovered swiftj1644 + 57 nuclear radio transients . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the known and expected classes of long duration radio transients and conclude that the dynamic radio sky remains a rich area for further exploration . </S>",
    "<S> informed by the experience of past searches for radio transients , we suggest that future surveys pay closer attention to rare data errors and ensure that a wealth of sensitive multi - wavelength data be available in advance of the radio observations and that the radio searches should have assured follow - up resources . </S>"
