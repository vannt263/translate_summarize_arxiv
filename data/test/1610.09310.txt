    ". then the ldp will follow from a straightforward application of grtner ellis theorem because the function @xmath146 is finite and differentiable . in order to do that , by taking into account @xmath159 ( by ( [ eq : md - conditions ] ) ) , we consider the mac laurin formula of order 2 of @xmath160 namely @xmath161 then we obtain @xmath162 we conclude noting that the desired limit holds because @xmath163 by proposition [ mean_var_cov ] , and by taking into account the function @xmath158 in ( [ lambda - tilde ] ) .      [ rem : typical - remark - md ] a close inspection of the proof of proposition [ prop : md ] reveals that all the computations for moderate deviations work well even if @xmath166 ; note that in such a case the first condition in ( [ eq : md - conditions ] ) fails .",
