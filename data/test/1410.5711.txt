    "torque oscillator ( sto ) is a nanoscaled device , utilizing a dc current through a magnetized magnetic multi - layer structure to yield a steady - state voltage oscillation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the operating frequency of this voltage oscillation typically lies in the microwave range @xcite and can be widely tuned by altering the magnetic field and the dc current .",
    "the typical structure of an sto is presented in fig .",
    "it is composed of two magnetic layers , the `` free '' layer ( fl ) and the `` polarizing '' layer ( pl , or so - called `` fixed '' layer ) , being decoupled by a non - magnetic ( nm ) `` spacer '' . in this multi - layer structure , a spin - polarized current transfers angular momentum from the pl to the fl , so as to exert a torque on the local magnetization of the fl . by using this",
    "transferred torque to compensate the magnetic damping of the fl , magnetization dynamics can be sustained at microwave frequencies .",
    "the magnetization dynamics of the fl in the presence of spin - polarized current can be described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation with a slonczewski spin - transfer term ( llgs ) @xcite , @xcite @xmath0+\\frac{\\alpha(\\xi)}{m_\\text{0}}[{{\\mathbf{m}}}\\times{\\frac{{{\\mathrm{d}}}{{\\mathbf{m}}}}{{{\\mathrm{d}}}t}}]+{\\gamma}{{\\boldsymbol{\\tau_\\text{stt } } } } \\label{llgeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath2 is the damping parameter , @xmath3 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath4 is the magnetization of the fl , @xmath5 is the effective magnetic field acting on the fl , and @xmath6 is the spin transfer torque ( stt ) , which is used to cancel out the damping term so as to achieve a steady precession of the fl magnetization .",
    "@xmath6 can be expanded as @xmath7 + b_\\text{j}{{\\mathbf{m}}}\\times{{\\mathbf{m_\\text{p}}}}$ ] , where @xmath8 is the magnetization of the pl , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the bias - dependent coefficients of the in - plane and perpendicular torque , respectively . the stt has been used in magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) devices and modeled @xcite , @xcite to develop several novel spintronic devices . for example , the stt - based mtj has been employed in logic circuit designs @xcite , @xcite , and in the spin transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory ( stt - mram ) @xcite , @xcite , which outperforms sram in terms of power consumption and cost , as well as being non - volatile .",
    "the stt mtj models @xcite , @xcite used in logic circuits or memory applications , predict the switching between `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , then set either the dc resistance or the dc voltage of the mtj sto accordingly .",
    "they do not contain the rf dynamics of stos and hence are not suitable to present stos behavior . in stos ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics are detected by means of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) effect .",
    "this effect predicts a change in the resistance of the multi - layer depending on the relative orientation between the fl and pl .",
    "when stt stabilizes a precession of the fl magnetization , an oscillatory resistance is also established leading to an rf voltage generation by virtue of ohm s law .",
    "this voltage oscillation generated by the sto can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dc resistance of the sto under a specific biasing condition , @xmath13 is the applied current for driving the sto , @xmath14 is the amplitude of the resistance oscillation , @xmath15 is the frequency generated by the sto and @xmath16 represents the random phase fluctuation ( i.e. phase noise ) of the sto .",
    "stos exhibit a unique blend of features : high operating frequency , extremely wide tunability , high integration level with cmos technology , and fast turn - on time ( < 1 ns ) @xcite .",
    "thanks to these features , stos show potential to be used as up - converting mixers without the need for a local oscillator @xcite , frequency detectors @xcite , magnetic field sensors @xcite , and oscillators @xcite .",
    "currently , stos using an insulator as the spacer , in contrast to those using thin metallic spacers , offer higher output power and hence are more suitable for applications .",
    "the sto implemented with the thin insulator forms a tunnel junction between the magnetic layers @xcite , and it is the so - called mtj sto . the mtj sto is used as the base in this work .    to enable the use of mtj stos in applications ,",
    "a model is necessary to capture their characteristics and to be used in system- and circuit - level designs .",
    "the core of sto modeling is to solve the llgs .",
    "one possible approach to solve the llgs is based on micromagnetics @xcite , which describe the magnetization dynamics of the sto on a microscopic scale . however , this approach is not possible to implement using a hardware description language , such as verilog - a , due to the required complicated numeric computation .",
    "another approach is based on the macrospin approximation , which assumes that only a spatially - uniform magnetization precession is excited and the spin - polarized current is uniform across the area of the free layer @xcite .",
    "the macrospin - based sto model is able to provide an analytic solution with acceptable accuracy , while allowing implementation in a hardware description language . as a result ,",
    "the macrospin - based analytical model can be employed in the design of sto - based systems .",
    "two such models , which provide the rf characteristics of the mtj sto , have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , these models contain equations that are usable for matching one specific device and are not fully verified by either experiments or theory .",
    "additionally , the dc operating point of these models has not been analyzed , limiting the accuracy of the model for circuit- or system - level design .",
    "furthermore , only one specific device has been used to verify the models , which is not sufficient .",
    "this paper presents a new comprehensive and compact mtj sto model , which can overcome the issues of the existing mtj sto models and be applied to mtj stos with arbitrary parameters .",
    "our model is based on the hamiltonian formalism presented in @xcite as well as extensive analysis of the literature , and it is completed by estimations including but not limited to the dc operating point and electrical rf power .",
    "we verify our model by three different mtj sto measurements under different possible biasing conditions , published by different groups .",
    "all the characteristics of the proposed model follow the measurements closely .",
    "furthermore , the proposed analytical model provides a comparable accuracy with the micromagnetics - based model .",
    "thereafter , it is implemented in verilog - a , encapsulating the characteristics of mtj stos , and is ready for being used by the device and circuit community to implement sto - based systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in part",
    "i , the theoretical analyses of the effective magnetic field and the characteristics of the proposed mtj sto model are provided .",
    "part ii describes the implementation of the proposed model in verilog - a and presents the simulation results of the stand - alone mtj sto model .",
    "finally , the proposed model is further validated in an sto - based system , where the sto verilog - a model is simulated together with cmos rf circuits .",
    "the actual structure of mtj stos is complex and can vary in different mtj stos @xcite-@xcite , as it is given in .",
    "however , the generalized stack structure of the mtj sto , as it is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and considered in @xcite , is identical for different mtj stos . based on this stack structure , an analytical model of the mtj sto using the actual cross section size , will be proposed and then verified by comparing it against three different mtj stos @xcite-@xcite provided by different research groups .",
    "a summary of the important parameters used in this analytical model to obtain the characteristics of these three mtj stos @xcite-@xcite is presented in table ii .",
    "the values of most of the parameters in table ii are available in @xcite-@xcite as either measured or suggested values . most of these values are directly employed in this work .",
    "nevertheless , some values that are provided by @xcite-@xcite are slightly adjusted so as to match the analytical model to experiments under different biasing conditions .",
    "the adjustments are less than 25@xmath17 of the measured or suggested values . besides , the values of some parameters are not given in @xcite-@xcite , as noted in table ii , so that the empirical values from literature are used . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the only phenomenological parameters and will be detailed later .",
    "it should be mentioned that the notations of parameters and sto output characteristics , as well as the notations of external and effective magnetic fields , used in different publications @xcite-@xcite are not identical . to obtain the characteristics of the sto , such as operating frequency , output power , and linewidth ( the full width at half - maximum ) , according to the macrospin - based analytical model in @xcite ,",
    "the first step is to calculate the effective field .",
    ".actual structures of different mtj stos [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     values without notes are either measured or suggested values in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these values are slightly adjusted based on the measured or suggested values given in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "* empirical values .    * * phenomenological parameters .    the effective field , based on @xcite , can be solved by the boundary conditions derived from the integral formulation of maxwell s equations for magnetic fields .",
    "however , the boundary conditions ( eq.(102a-102c ) in @xcite ) take only the magnetic anisotropy field @xmath20 into account for simplicity , which is not sufficient to achieve an accurate mtj sto model since the perpendicular torque and the inter - layer coupling field @xmath21 @xcite-@xcite are considerable in the mtj sto .",
    "the perpendicular torque introduces an additional field with the amplitude of @xmath22 ( see eq.1 ) .",
    "consequently , the boundary conditions including @xmath22 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 are both along @xmath23 axis ) , along @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 axes can be derived as    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the magnitude , out - of - plane and in - plane angles of the effective field ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the magnitude , out - of - plane and in - plane angles of the external applied field , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the perpendicular torque coefficient @xmath35 , as detailedly studied in @xcite is a function of the voltage @xmath36 across the sto .",
    "it is usually determined from the comparison of the theoretical and experimental characteristics . in @xcite , the expression @xmath35=37@xmath37 with the unit of oe ,",
    "is used to estimate the additional field introduced by the perpendicular torque for the free - layer excitation mode , where the edge mode is neglected .",
    "although an additional quadratic term has been previously reported @xcite , its magnitude is relatively small and does not show any significant impact when included in our model . because of this and the uncertainty in the exact value for this quadratic coefficient , only the linear dependence is implemented .",
    "this linear dependence from @xcite is found to accurately match the characteristics of the mtj stos also in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the sake of generality , the proposed model allows users changing the coefficients of @xmath35 easily , for the cases where the above expression can not be successfully applied .    for mtj stos , the external field",
    "is typically applied in - plane ( @xmath33 = 0 ) @xcite so that the boundary conditions ( eq.(3a-3c ) ) can be reduced to    @xmath38    @xmath39    where eq.(4a ) gives the solution to @xmath31 , from which @xmath40 can be obtained from eq.(4b ) .",
    "these simplified equations enable easy implementation of the equation solver in verilog - a and rapid simulations , so that they are employed to obtain the effective field of mtj stos .",
    "the electrical signal generated by an mtj sto comprises a dc and an ac ( oscillating ) component .",
    "the dc component of the mtj sto model can be expressed by either the dc voltage across the mtj sto or its dc resistance , since the dc current is applied externally .",
    "the ac ( oscillating ) component is characterized by the operating frequency , peak power ( or amplitude ) and linewidth .      in the existing models @xcite , the mtj stos are assumed to be in the anti - parallel state ( with a fixed dc resistance of @xmath41 ) , and the dc operating point is not analyzed .",
    "nonetheless , in order to compute the other characteristics of the mtj sto and enable the design of on - chip biasing circuits for it , the dc operating point of the mtj sto is of importance .",
    "the dc voltage across the mtj sto can be simply calculated by @xmath42 , where @xmath12 is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath41 and @xmath44 are the resistances of the mtj sto in anti - parallel and parallel states respectively . as it can be noticed from eq.(5 ) , the dc operating point ( or dc resistance ) of the mtj sto can vary greatly as @xmath31 changes .",
    "the operating frequency @xmath15 , according to @xcite , is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency and coefficient of the nonlinear frequency shift respectively , which can be obtained from eq.(103 ) , eq.(104a ) and eq.(105a ) in @xcite once the effective field is determined ; @xmath48 is the dimensionless power , which is a coefficient that is proportional to the experimentally measured rf power of the sto @xcite and is involved in calculating all the characteristics of mtj stos , hence it is a critical quantity . as detailed in @xcite ( eq.(84b ) ) , @xmath48 is a function of the supercriticality @xmath49 , nonlinear damping coefficient @xmath50 and noise power @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath49 is defined as the ratio between @xmath13 and the threshold current @xmath51 of the mtj sto .",

    "the trend of the linewidth obtained from the model , yet , agrees with the theoretical analysis in @xcite .",
