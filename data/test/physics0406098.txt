    "the use of superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite in ultra - sensitive magnetic measurements systems may nowadays be considered as a standard technique , to the extent that several companies offer reliable and automated commercial squid magnetometers .",
    "however , no commercial magnetometer has yet become available for operation at millikelvin temperatures utilizing a dilution refrigerator .",
    "a few systems have been constructed that combine the sensitivity of squid magnetometery with the millikelvin temperature range attainable by means of @xmath1he/@xmath2he dilution refrigerators @xcite , at the cost of requiring the sample to be mounted on dedicated sample holders , which ensure the thermalization to the cold plate of the refrigerator by means of conducting thermal links .",
    "we describe here a squid magnetometer designed to allow high - sensitivity measurements down to @xmath3 mk , while retaining the compatibility with the sample holders used in commercial magnetometers .",
    "moreover , we wanted to avoid building a system dedicated exclusively to squid magnetometery . our setup can accommodate several different experimental probes , e.g. for nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , inductance - bridge - based _",
    "ac_-susceptometery @xcite and resistivity measurements .",
    "finally , we wrote a software that fully automates the system and offers a very user - friendly interface to program the measurement sequences and analyze the data .",
    "an example of research for which our setup was particularly designed is the field of metallic nanoclusters , which show spectacular quantum - size effects in their thermodynamic properties @xcite at very low temperatures , as a consequence of which their magnetic susceptibility is very small in this regime .",
    "furthermore , since most of these materials are highly air - sensitive , it is a necessity to introduce and keep the sample in a sealed glass tube , that allows at the same time to perform preliminary measurements at @xmath4 k in commercial squid magnetometers and pre - check the quality of the sample in a fast and cheap way . the sample , in its sample holder ,",
    "can thereupon be inserted in the ultra - low temperature squid magnetometer without need of any further manipulation , which constitutes an obvious advantage .    the really challenging part of the design consists in the fact that , like in most commercial and non - commercial @xcite magnetometers , to obtain the absolute value of the magnetization we need to move the sample through a gradiometer pick - up coil , but in our case the sample is at @xmath5 mk inside the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator ! the sample movement is needed because the coils of the gradiometer will never perfectly compensate one another , leaving an empty - coil signal that will add a spurious contribution to the measured magnetic moment , or even wash out the signal of the sample to be measured .",
    "as we shall discuss below , this has required a system that moves the _ whole _ dilution refrigerator insert .",
    "scheme of the low-@xmath6 part of the dilution refrigerator . for clarity",
    "we omit the vacuum can and the radiation shields anchored at the still and at the 80 mk pot .",
    "only the narrow tail of the refrigerator is inserted in the bore of a 9 t superconducting magnet ( not shown).,width=321 ]    our ultra - low temperature setup is based on a leiden cryogenics mnk126 - 400rof dilution refrigerator . instead of the standard copper mixing chamber , we fitted the system with a specially designed plastic mixing chamber that allows the sample to be thermalized directly by the @xmath1he flow . a scheme of the low - temperature part of the refrigerator is shown in fig .",
    "the mixing chamber consists of two concentric tubes , obtained by rolling a kapton foil coated with stycast 1266 epoxy .",
    "the tops of each tube are glued into concentric araldite pots : the inner pot receives the downward flow of condensed @xmath1he and , a few millimeters below the inlet , the phase separation between pure @xmath1he phase and dilute @xmath1he/@xmath2he phase takes place . the circulation of @xmath1he is then forced downwards along the inner kapton tube , which has openings on the bottom side to allow the return of the @xmath1he stream through the thin space in between the tubes .",
    "both the bottom of the kapton tail and the outer pot are closed by conical araldite plugs smeared with apiezon n grease . the sample is typically placed inside a capsule filled with cotton and inserted in a plastic straw , fixed onto the bottom aradite plug .",
    "alternatively , for samples being air sensitive or having very small magnetic signal , one may largely reduce the background contribution of the holder by placing the sample between two suprasil glass rods inside a suprasil tube @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this way",
    ", the sample is placed in a symmetric configuration with respect to the pick - up coil systems , so that the only signal induced by the vertical movement is that originating from the sample space and the sample itself .",
    "both types of sample holders are compatible with the commercial squid magnetometers ( cryogenic consultant limited s600c , quantum design mpms-5 and mpms - xl ) available in our laboratory for magnetic measurements at @xmath4 k.     sketch of the symmetric suprasil glass sample holder.,width=321 ]    the kapton tail , which is about 35 cm long , is surrounded by two silver - plated brass radiation shields , one anchored at the 80 mk pot , the other at the still .",
    "the whole low-@xmath6 part of the refrigerator is closed by a vacuum can , which has itself a thin brass tail to surround the kapton part of the mixing chamber , and is inserted into the bore of an oxford instruments 9 tesla nbti superconducting magnet . in this way , only kapton and brass cylinders ( plus the lowest araldite plug )",
    "are placed in the high - field region , whereas all other highly - conducting metal parts ( heat exchangers , 80 mk pot , @xmath1he distillator , etc . )",
    "are outside the magnet bore and subject only to a small stray field .",
    "this design minimizes the eddy current heating resulting from moving the refrigerator through the pick - up coil of the squid magnetometer , while at the same time thermalizing the sample directly by the contact with the @xmath1he flow .",
    "the excellent sample thermalization obtained is this way has already proven to be essential for nmr experiments on molecular magnets performed in the same refrigerator down to @xmath7 mk , whose success depends crucially on the efficient cooling of the nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "the temperature inside the mixing chamber is monitored by measuring , with a picowatt avs-47 bridge , the resistance of a speer carbon thermometer placed in the outer part of the top araldite pot . by adding an extra speer thermometer ( calibrated against the previous one ) in the bottom of the kapton tail",
    ", we have verified that the temperature is very uniform along the whole chamber ( except in the presence of sudden heat pulses ) : even at the lowest @xmath6 , the mismatch between the measured values is typically @xmath8 mk . during normal operation , the thermometer in the bottom of the tail",
    "is obviously omitted , to avoid its contribution to the measured magnetic signal .",
    "a leiden cryogenics triple current source is used to apply heating currents to a manganin wire , anti - inductively wound and glued around a copper joint just above the @xmath1he inlet in the mixing chamber . in this way we can heat the incoming @xmath1he stream and",
    "uniformly increase the mixing chamber temperature .",
    "for the @xmath1he circulation we employ an oil - free pumping system , consisting of a roots booster pump ( edwards eh500 ) with a pumping speed of 500 m@xmath1/h , backed by two 10 m@xmath1/h dry scroll pumps ( edwards xds10 ) in parallel .",
    "the main pumping line is a @xmath9 100 mm solid tube , fixed at the pump side with a flexible rubber joint that allows for an inclination of a few degrees , and is connected to the head of the fridge by a `` t '' piece with two extra rubber bellows , to reduce the vibrations transmitted by the pumping system . in this configuration ,",
    "the system reaches a base temperature of 9 mk .",
    "the typical @xmath1he circulation rate at the base temperature is @xmath10 @xmath11mol / s , and the cooling power at 100 mk is @xmath12 @xmath11w .",
    "when the kapton tail is replaced by a flat plug , @xmath13 can be increased up to 700 @xmath11w @ 100 mk and @xmath14 @xmath11mol / s by applying extra heat to the still ; with the tail in place it s more difficult to increase the circulation rate , and @xmath13 @ 100 mk hardly exceeds 250 @xmath11w .",
    "a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) is basically an ultra - sensitive flux - to - voltage converter , that exploits the peculiar quantum properties of closed superconducting circuits .",
    "a detailed description of its working principle can be found in textbooks @xcite , or in  2.4.1 of ref .",
    "here we just recall that a _ dc_-squid , like the one used in our system , consists of a superconducting ring interrupted by two josephson junctions , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , each characterized by a critical current @xmath17 , which represents the maximum current that may flow through the junction without dissipation .",
    "the _ dc_-squid is operated by biasing the junctions @xmath15 and @xmath16 with a current @xmath18 , such that a voltage @xmath19 develops across them ( fig .",
    "the essential feature is that the voltage can be modulated by an applied magnetic flux @xmath20 , since the critical current @xmath17 also depends on @xmath20 .",
    "one finds that the screening current @xmath21 that circulates in the squid ring is related to the critical current @xmath17 of the junctions ( assumed to be identical ) by : @xmath22 , \\label{isdc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 wb is the flux quantum , @xmath24 is the self - inductance of the ring and @xmath25 is the shift in the phase of the superconducting order parameter which develops across each junction .",
    "@xmath17 is obtained by maximizing @xmath21 , yielding the periodic form of @xmath26 shown in fig .",
    "3 . by properly choosing the bias conditions , the _ dc_-squid operates therefore as a flux - to - voltage converter , where the external flux can be applied by injecting a current in the input coil .",
    "notice that a small fraction of a flux quantum can produce voltage changes of the order of millivolts ! in the practice a _",
    "dc_-squid is used in feedback mode by employing a so - called flux - lock loop ( fll ) , i.e. adding a feedback coil that produces a compensating flux such that @xmath27 .",
    "this increases the accuracy and the dynamic range of the measurement , and allows to implement noise - reducing detection schemes .",
    "working principle of a _",
    "dc_-squid as flux - to - voltage converter.,width=321 ]    to use a _ dc_-squid in an actual magnetometer , it is still necessary ( except in a rather radical design like the `` microsquid '' @xcite ) to produce a current proportional to the magnetic moment of the sample to be measured . such a current can be injected in the input coil to produce a flux that is coupled to the squid ring by the mutual inductance @xmath28 .",
    "typically , the input current is obtained by constructing a closed superconducting circuit which includes the squid s input coil on one side , and terminates with a pick - up coil on the other side .",
    "once the circuit has been cooled down below the superconducting critical temperature , the enclosed flux is constant .",
    "any change in the magnetic permeability of the circuit , for instance due to the sample , will result in a screening current that , while keeping the total flux constant , produces the required flux in the input coil . in our case , the change in permeability of the pick - up circuit is obtained by vertically moving the _ whole _ dilution refrigerator , whose tail , that contains the sample , is inserted in the pick - up coil .",
    "because of the high sensitivity , it is essential to make sure that no sources of flux other than the sample may couple with the squid .",
    "this can be done by employing a gradiometer , which in its simplest form consists of two coils wound in opposite direction , so that the flux produced by any uniform magnetic field cancels out , and only the gradient of @xmath29 can be detected ( first - order gradiometer ) .",
    "a further improvement is the second - order gradiometer , shown in fig .",
    "[ gradiometer ] , which is obtained by inserting a coil with @xmath30 windings between two coils with @xmath31 turns each , wound opposite to the central one .",
    "this design eliminates also the effects of linear field gradients .",
    "furthermore , according to the reciprocity principle @xcite , the flux @xmath20 produced in a coil of arbitrary geometry by a magnetic moment @xmath11 at position @xmath32 is related to the field @xmath33 produced by the same coil in @xmath32 when carrying a current @xmath34 such that : @xmath35 the field produced by a single - loop coil is equivalent to the field of a magnetic dipole , whereas a first - order gradiometer is a magnetic quadrupole , and a second - order is an octupole , so that the fields they produce vary in space like @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . from eq.([recip ] ) it is clear that a second - order gradiometer is the least sensitive to magnetic fields produced outside of the coil system .     a second - order gradiometer in helmoltz geometry ( @xmath39 ) and the magnetic flux induced by a dipole moving along @xmath40 .",

    "ground loops in the squid system would be to ground the squid sensor and its cable at the cryostat ( and take care that it remains a very clean ground ) , and connect the controller to an isolation transformer @xcite .",
    "this method is not practicable when communication with the computer via the gpib bus is needed , and the same computer is connected to another instrument that requires a common ground with the cryostat ( this is the case for the picowatt avs-47 resistance bridge ) .",

    "10 a dataset obtained by measuring 1.9 mg of the paramagnetic salt manganese antipyrine mn(c@xmath88h@xmath89on@xmath90)@xmath91(clo@xmath92)@xmath90 ( mnapy ) , in a constant applied field @xmath93 mt while slowly cooling down the refrigerator .",
    "the paramagnetic centers in mnapy are the mn@xmath94 ions , with spin @xmath95 and gyromagnetic factor @xmath96 . in this sort of measurements we typically use the `` continuous + direct '' mode , which allows to perform the scans rather quickly ( @xmath97 min ) as compared to the timescale of the temperature changes",
    ". the volume susceptibility @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is the mass of the sample and @xmath100 kg / m@xmath1 is the density ) can be obtained from the measured magnetic moment @xmath11 and compared with the expected behavior of a curie paramagnet @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the curie constant and @xmath103 m@xmath104 is the number of spins per unit volume . in view of the high value of @xmath105 obtained at very low temperature ,",
    "the comparison is meaningful only after having corrected the raw data for demagnetizing effects : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the demagnetizing factor .",
    "since the sample is in powder form , @xmath107 will be an effective demagnetizing factor appropriate for the container ( in this case a cylindrical capsule ) filled with the grains .",
    "this is a notoriously complex problem that can only be solved in an approximate way . in a first step",
    "the relation should be found between the applied field @xmath108 and the local field @xmath109 acting on a grain in the container .",
    "the dipolar contributions from the other grains can be divided in a shape - dependent part given by the demagnetizing factor @xmath110 of the container , and a `` structural '' part given by the packing of the grains . in a second step",
    "the relation between @xmath109 and the local field @xmath111 inside a grain should be found .",
    "the difference between @xmath109 and @xmath111 will now be due to the shape - dependent contribution related to the demagnetizing factor @xmath112 of the grain and the structural part arising from the crystal structure of the material .    in view of all the uncertainties",
    "involved , the simplest solution for the present purpose appears to assume all grains to have identical shape and to adopt , for both steps , the lorentz approximation to estimate the contributions depending on the structural aspects .",
    "thereby we shall also neglect the contributions from the dipoles inside the spheres .",
    "one then obtains :      where @xmath114 is the filling fraction ( volume ) of the container and where the last equality follows from the assumption @xmath115 , i.e. we assume all grains to have a spherical shape .",
    "given the shape of the sample holder , we estimate the demagnetizing factor of the container @xmath116 , which yields @xmath117 . taking for the filling factor @xmath118 ( ideally packed spheres would yield @xmath119 ) , we obtain the corrected volume susceptibility shown in fig . 10 .",
    "@xmath120 closely follows the calculated ideal curie law , except for some small deviations below @xmath121 k. such deviations are better appreciated when plotting @xmath122 _ vs _ @xmath6 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "as it appears , the susceptibility remains always slightly lower than the value for an ideal curie paramagnet .",
    "this can be attributed to a small crystal field anisotropy of the mn@xmath94 electron spins , which causes a reduction of the effective curie constant at very low temperatures due to the depopulation of the excited energy levels in the zero - field split manifold @xcite .",
    "another reason for the deviation may be an ( antiferromagnetic ) ordering of the moments , e.g. due to the dipolar interactions between them . as an estimate of the interaction energy , @xmath123 , we may consider the dipolar coupling between two mn@xmath94 spins @xmath124 at a distance @xmath125 nm in the mnapy compound .",
    "one then obtains @xmath126 mk .",
    "although this estimate is very rough , it is an indication that such an ordering phenomenon may not be excluded .",
    "the uncertainty in the choice of @xmath107 makes it rather delicate to analyze the data in more detail , but for the purpose of the present discussion we may state that the thermalization of the sample does not pose any special problem down to our lowest achievable temperature .",

    "inset : inverse of the corrected susceptibility ( open circles ) , fitted by the curie - weiss law ( solid line ) , yielding @xmath127 mk.,width=321 ]    the typical noise at the squid in normal operation , i.e. while all the pumps are running and the dilution refrigerator insert is being moved , is @xmath97 mv , which translates into an equivalent magnetic noise @xmath128 am@xmath129 ( @xmath130 emu ) . measuring a magnetic moment @xmath131 am@xmath129 ( 0.1 emu ) in `` null mode '' requires a compensation current @xmath132 ma , which poses no problems to the compensation circuitry ; this means that our system can easily cover a dynamic range of five orders of magnitude in magnetic moment .",
    "as for the maximum applicable magnetic field , although the magnet itself can produce 9 t , the squid circuitry tends to become unstable above @xmath121 t. this a rather typical value when no special cautions are taken to stabilize the field and screen the squid circuitry from the stray fields : in specialized systems@xcite , operation up to 8 t has been achieved by designing a dedicated magnet with large bore and by adding a nbti superconducting shield around the sample- and pickup coils- space .",
    "we recall that our system is not dedicated uniquely to squid magnetometery and can accommodate , for instance , nmr experiments where the possibility of producing continuous field sweeps is essential .",
    "we thank j. sese for the precious advice about squid sensors , k. siemensmeyer for the suggestions on the design of the pickup system , t. g. sorop for the high-@xmath6 measurements and the fruitful discussions , and f. luis for his contributions in the early stage of the project .",
