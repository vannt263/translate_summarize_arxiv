    "neutron star , which is called as pulsar in an observational view , is one of the hottest object of study during the past decades , as neutron star provides a gold mine for the fundamental physics , including nuclear physics , astrophysics , particle physics and general relativity .",
    "meanwhile , the nature of matter at super high densities is one of the great unsolved problems in modern science , and it is believed that neutron star is the natural and irreplaceable laboratory for investigating the super dense matters @xcite .",
    "therefore , among the multitudinous studies on the neutron stars , one important direction is to survey the constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of the dense matters based on the accurate and reliable observations on neutron stars , such as the fastest observed spin frequency ( 716hz)@xcite and the observed massive masses ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , where both of them are come from radio pulsars . in this direction",
    ", it is worth looking forward to obtaining more strict constraint on the equation of state of dense matter by measuring the radius of neutron stars to accuracies of a few percent by the next generation of hard x - ray timing instruments @xcite .",
    "another interesting direction is the theoretical researches on the eos of the dense matters based on the experiments in terrestrial laboratory and further investigations on the structure of neutron star by using the eos , which can provide a useful guide in primary understanding the properties of pulsars @xcite .",
    "presently , there are two characteristic parameters of the pulsars ( neutron stars ) have been observed very accurately , that is , the spin frequencies ( or periods ) and the stellar masses .",
    "more than 2400 pulsars are now observed @xcite . as most of the pulsars are identified by their pulses ( it is believed that the beams of radiation waves come from the magnetic pole region with one pulse per rotation )",
    ", this means that the spin frequencies for most of the known neutron stars have been accurately observed .",
    "typical observed spin period is a few hundred millisecond ( ms ) .",
    "presently , the known spin periods of neutron stars are in a region from 1.4 ms to 12s @xcite , and based on which the neutron stars are classified as two groups : normal pulsars with spin periods p@xmath730 ms and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) with p@xmath830 ms , where msps comprise about 15% of the known pulsar population @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand that the massive - mass and small - size neutron star can support a very rapid spin frequency as the centrifugal force can be balanced by the super strong gravity .",
    "theoretical investigations show that a high - mass neutron star ( with mass @xmath9 ) can support a sub - millisecond spin period @xcite ; and even a low - mass neutron star still can support a relative rapid spin period ( for example , a neutron star with @xmath10 can support a period @xmath11 2ms ) @xcite . on the other hand , being different from the spin period observation , there are only few neutron stars having accurate stellar - mass measurements .",
    "up to date , the number of reliable and precise mass - measured neutron stars is only 32 @xcite .",
    "these samples still can not be used as an observational evidence to constrain the upper or lower mass - limit for neutron stars . among these accurate mass - measured neutron stars , j0348 + 0432 has the highest mass ( @xmath12 ) , and j0453 + 1559(c ) has the lowest mass ( @xmath13)@xcite . in addition , the fraction of the massive nss ( with @xmath14 ) is about 20@xmath15 of the observed population @xcite .",
    "there is an untended inconsistency between the theoretical results and observations : the lower mass limit of the cold static neutron star is about @xmath16 in theory while the observed lowest mass of neutron star is @xmath17 @xcite . and up to date all of the observations , including the spin frequencies and the stellar masses , still can not confirm or rule out the existence of the low - mass neutron stars in the universe .",
    "theoretically , it is found that for the newly born proton - neutron stars , because of the larger thermal and neutrino - trapping effects , the minimum mass limit of neutron star is expected to increase to 0.9@xmath111.1 @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this means that a low - mass neutron star can not be produced directly by the supernova explosion .",
    "does this mean that there is no possibility to exist neutron stars with masses smaller than 0.9@xmath18 ?",
    "the answer is no !",
    "there are other ways to form a cold and static neutron star with lower mass .",
    "for example , in a binary pulsar system , if the distance between two stars is sufficiently small , the star with less mass and larger size will lose mass due to the gravitational pull by the companion star with high mass and small size .",
    "this is a self - accelerating process , because decrease of mass leads to increase of neutron star size , and vice versa . and",
    "this process makes it even more accessible to the mass loss until the less mass star reaches its minimum mass limit ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that when the less mass neutron star crosses the @xmath19 , it will undergo an explosion @xcite .",
    "one inspiring news for the neutron star observation is that the five - hundred - meter aperture spherical radio telescope ( fast ) , the largest single dish radio telescope in the world , has been completed by sept . 2 , 2016 in china .",
    "fast s high instantaneous sensitivity provides the potential capacity to discover thousands of pulsars in the near future , which is far more than the number of the observed pulsars ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , it is hopeful that fast may increase substantially the number of the accurate - mass - measured neutron stars and even find the low - mass neutron star in the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the theoretical researches focused on the normal neutron stars ( with mass @xmath21 ) or the massive neutron stars ( with mass @xmath22 ) and few of them concentrated on the low - mass neutron stars ( with mass @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "since there are possibilities in theory to exist the low - mass neutron stars , it is interesting to investigate them further , especially the observable quantities , which may provide useful guide for the future observation on the low - mass neutron star .",
    "therefore , in this work we will focus on the low - mass neutron stars , especially for those above the minimum mass limit .",
    "moreover , if the low - mass neutron star is observed in the near future , it is also interesting to study the relations between the eos of the inner curst and the global properties of the low - mass neutron star , as the low - mass neutron stars comprise the information of inner crust matters , in which the compositions and equation of states are not well assured yet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a short introduction , we present the eos of the low - mass neutron star matters in sec .",
    "the detailed properties of the low - mass neutron stars and discussions are shown in sec .",
    "iii , conclusions and outlooks are given in the last section .",
    "normally , a neutron star is believed to be composed of three main parts : ( 1 ) the outer crust , with density from about @xmath24 to the density of neutron - drip point @xmath25 @xcite ; ( 2 ) the inner crust , with density from @xmath26 to the density of crust - core transition , which is about half of saturation nuclear density @xmath27 , but not assured yet ; ( 3 ) the uniform inner core , with density up to several times of @xmath27 at the stellar center .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron star matters is a basic input for theoretical investigation on the construction of neutron star .    in the outer crust , at densities below about @xmath28 a fraction of electrons",
    "are bound to the nuclei ; while at densities between @xmath28 @xmath11 @xmath25 ) the electrons are free and soon become relativistic as the density increases @xcite .",
    "the eos of the ground state of the outer crust can be well determined by using the experimental masses of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "thus there is no distinct difference among the different models for the outer crust . in theoretical investigation on the neutron star structure , many of the researchers adopted the bps models @xcite as the eos of outer curst matters .",
    "another improved eos for the outer crust is established by haensel and pichon based on the new progress in the experimental determination of masses of neutron rich nuclei @xcite .    the inner crust of neutron star comprises the region from neutron - drip surface up to the crust - core transition edge , inside which the dense matters are believed to melt into the uniform liquid core . above the neutron drip point ,",
    "the energetic neutrons are no longer bound by the nuclei and the dripped neutrons form a free neutron gas . thus , the matters in the inner crust is believed to be composed of nuclei , neutrons and electrons under the conditions of @xmath29 stability and charge neutrality .",
    "the properties of nuclei in the inner crust matters are expected being very different from those of terrestrial nuclei because their properties are influenced by the gas of dripped neutrons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eos of the inner crust matters is still theoretical model dependent . in this work",
    ", four representative eoss for the inner crust matters will be employed to investigate the low - mass neutron stars .",
    "they are the bbp eos @xcite , the nv eos @xcite , the fps21 eos @xcite , and the sly4 eos @xcite .",
    "the bbp eos describes the nuclei by a compressible liquid - drop model to take into account the effects of the free neutrons which exert a pressure on the surface of the nuclei and thus lower the nuclear surface energy .",
    "another important physical factor first taking into account in this model is the attractive coulomb interaction between nuclei ( that is , the lattice binding energy ) , which is very important in determining the size of nuclei .",
    "the nv eos is constructed by negele and vautheri in 1973 , which is the first group to use the quantum calculations investigating the matters of the inner crust @xcite .",
    "they determined the structure of the inner crust by minimizing the total energy per nucleon in a wigner - seitz sphere , and treating the electrons as a relativistic fermi gas .",
    "the fps21 eos employs a generalized type of skyrme interaction , which fits well to both the nuclear and neutron - matter calculations of friedman and pandharipande @xcite .",
    "the sly4 eos is based on the sly ( skyrme lyon ) effective nucleon - nucleon interactions with a new set of improved parameters which can reproduce the new experimental data very well @xcite .",
    "a detailed review for the physics of neutron star crusts please refer to the literature @xcite .",
    "the eoss of inner crust adopted in this work are presented in fig .",
    "it is shown that the main disparity among these eoss is in the density region from about @xmath30 to @xmath31 , where fps21 eos , sly4 eos and bbp eos are stiffer than nv eos in the density region from about @xmath30 to @xmath32 , and sly4 eos , bbp eos and nv eos are stiffer than fps21 eos in the density region from about @xmath32 to @xmath33 .     the equation of states ( eoss ) for the inner curst .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]     the eoss for the inner core , where the inset describes the eoss for the outer crust .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in order to investigate the whole sequences of the neutron stars described by different eoss models , we also calculate the whole mass - radius relations of the compact stars from the white dwarf models up to the upper mass limit of neutron stars , where the eoss of the inner crust are smoothly joined to the eoss of the uniform liquid inner core and the eoss of the outer crust based on the following literatures ( for simplifying the expression of eoss , in the following part of this paper , the eoss combining the outer crust and the inner core are also denoted by above abbreviation of eoss for the inner crust ) : ( 1 ) for the bbp eos , the outer crust is connected by the bps eos , the inner core is combined by the eos constructed by pandharipande @xcite , where the parameters of the crust - core transition are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xcite , and the whole data of the joined eos are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ; ( 2 ) for the nv eos , the eos of the outer crust is taken from the work of harrison and wheeler @xcite , the dbhf eos is employed to describe the inner core @xcite , where the parameters of the crust - core transition are @xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite , and the whole data of the joined eos are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ; ( 3 ) for the fps21 eos , the eos of the outer crust is constructed by haensel and pichon @xcite , the inner core is joined by the famous apr eos @xcite , where the parameters of the crust - core transition are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite , and the whole data of the joined eos are kindly provided by mr .",
    "krastev @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) for the sly4 eos , the outer crust is also connected by the model of haensel and pichon @xcite , and the inner core is described by the sly4 model @xcite , where the parameters of the crust - core transition are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xcite , and the whole data of the joined eos are taken from ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , the transition region from the highly ordered crystal to the uniform liquid core is complicated and is poorly understood , and up to date , the transition density is still very divergent @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the position of the crust - core transition edge is mainly responsible for such as the glitches , and does not directly effect the mass - radius relation and the lower mass limit for a certain eos .",
    "the eoss for the inner core are presented in fig . [ 2 ] , where the eoss of the outer crust is shown in the inset .",
    "it is shown that for all of the adopted eoss , the eoss of the outer crust matters are similar ; and for the inner core , bbp eos is relative soft .",
    "theoretical investigation on the minimum mass for neutron stars has a long history .",
    "the first estimate of minimum mass @xmath19 , which is about 0.17 @xmath18 without taking into account the nuclear interactions , was obtained by oppenheimer & serber @xcite .",
    "updated research shows that the minimum mass is around 0.09 @xmath18 and has a weakly eos dependence @xcite . for a low - mass neutron star in binary system , if it loses its mass below the minimum mass @xmath19 through gravitational pull by the companion star , an explosion will be undergone @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the stars sequence in the @xmath45 curve with central densities @xmath46 smaller than that of @xmath19 , where @xmath47 , as shown in fig . [ 3 ] , equilibrium configuration will also do not exist , as it will become unstable with respect to small radial perturbations @xcite .",
    "thus , we only need to care for the stable low - mass neutron stars with mass above the minimum mass @xmath19 .",
    "the stellar masses as a function of the central densities for the four adopted eoss , where the central density ranges from @xmath48 to @xmath49 and the star sequence covers from white dwarfs to neutron stars . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]     the mass - radius relations for the four adopted eoss .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in order to find the common characters and also show the effect of the eoss on the low - mass neutron stars , we choose four typical eoss of the inner crust , as have been described in sec .",
    "ii , to investigate the properties and structures of the low - mass neutron stars . for convenient to understand the whole star sequence and where the low - mass neutron stars located , we plot the @xmath45 relations ( in fig . [ 3 ] ) and @xmath50 relations ( in fig .",
    "[ 4 ] ) in a wide central density region ( from @xmath51 to @xmath49 ) .",
    "because of the instability induced by radial perturbations , between the white dwarfs and neutron stars there is a wide forbidden region for the central densities ( from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) to form a compact star , as shown in fig .",
    "one interesting phenomenon is that the forbidden density region is spanned about five orders , which is approximately equal to the orders of the product of @xmath52 and the relative intensity between the strong interaction and electromagnetic interaction , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass of a neutron and an electron , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , because of the same reason there is a size forbidden area for the compact stars , that is , there is no compact star having a radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km , as shown in fig .",
    "it is also shown in this figure that in the stable neutron star sequence , when the stellar mass smaller than about @xmath55 , the radius will increase rapidly as the stellar mass decreases .",
    "before the stellar mass reaches the @xmath19 , the radius of neutron star can increase over 200 km , which is far larger than the size of the normal neutron stars , this point is shown more clearly in fig . [ 5 ] .",
    "the larger size is the main characteristics of the neutron star with mass around the @xmath19 .",
    "certainly , the existence of @xmath19 of neutron stars means that there is also a forbidden area for the mass of neutron star , that is , there is no stable neutron stars with mass below @xmath19 .     the mass - radius relations for the low - mass neutron stars , where the inset is the masses as a function of the central densities , and the small square on the line denotes the @xmath19 point .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ 6 ]   the mass profile for the neutron star with minimum mass limit , where the inset is the corresponding density profile . ,",

    "[ tab : table1 ] .",
    "it is shown that three of the eoss ( bbs , fps21 , sly4 ) give a @xmath19 around @xmath56 , while nv eos gives a relative smaller @xmath19 with value of @xmath57 and a relative larger radius about 360 km . as the central density of the neutron star at @xmath19 point is below the saturation density of nuclear matter ( as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : table1 ] ) , so the properties of the stars at @xmath19 points are only sensitive to the eoss at subnuclear densities . in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , it is shown that except for the density region from about @xmath30 to @xmath58 , where the nv eos is distinct softer than others , at the density region from about @xmath59 to @xmath60 , the nv eos is also slightly softer than others .",
    "the second softer eos , fps21 eos , has the similar consequence .",
    "thus it is natural to conclude that a softer eos for the inner crust leads to a lower @xmath19 but a larger radius of neutron star . in order to show the ultimate property more clearly",
    ", the @xmath50 relations and @xmath45 relations ( the inset ) around the @xmath19 points are plotted in fig . [",
    "it is shown that among the four adopted eoss , the nv eos ( with the smallest @xmath19 ) has a higher central density and a larger radius at the @xmath19 point .",
    "intuitively , we expect that a higher central density and a larger star size should give a higher stellar mass . in order to clear this misunderstanding , the mass profile and density profile ( the inset ) for the neutron stars at @xmath19 points",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "it is shown that although all of the radii of the neutron stars at @xmath19 points are larger than 200 km , about 90% of the stellar masses are centralized in the inner 10 km spheroids , thus the smallest @xmath19 of nv eos is come from the softness in the higher density region ( about @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the curves of the inset in fig . [ 5 ] show that starting from the distinct different density region ( from about @xmath63 to @xmath32 ) , the density profile for the minimum - mass star of nv eos decreases faster , which further leads to a slower descent at the lower density part and thus results in a larger radius . in summary , for a low - mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities ,",

    "what follows , we present three quantities of the low - mass neutron stars , which may be helpful in understanding the future observations for the low - mass neutron stars : the spin period at keplerian frequency , the moment of inertia and the redshift , which are presented in figs .",
    "[ 7]-[9 ] , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , in order to quantitatively show them , we also present the property parameters at @xmath19 points and at crust - core transition densities in tabs .",
    "[ tab : table1 ] and [ tab : table2 ] , respectively .",
    "it is shown that for a neutron star at minimum mass @xmath19 , its keplerian period is several hundred millisecond , which is beyond the period of a millisecond pulsars , but still in the region of the observed pulsars periods . from this point of view",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that some of the observed pulsars may have very lower stellar mass . as shown in fig.[7 ] , around the @xmath19 point , as the central density increases , the keplerian period increases very quickly . when the stellar mass increases up to about @xmath69 , as shown in tabs .",
    "[ tab : table2 ] , the star can finish a spin in about 20 ms , which already lies in the period region of millisecond pulsars .",
    "moreover , because of the larger size , we can qualitatively expect that a low - mass neutron star around the @xmath19 point may have a notable rotation deformation under the rapid spin .",
    "it has been recognized that the measurement of spin - orbit coupling provides a way to determine the moment of inertia of a star in a double pulsar system @xcite . as the moment of inertia of a star is close related to its mass and radius , if the mass and the moment of inertia are observed to the same neutron star",
    ", the radius can be determined very well , and then the eos can be constrained strictly . as a first step , the theoretical expected value of the moment of inertia for the low - mass neutrons star are study here . near the minimum mass point , because of the larger size ( with radius about 200 km ) , the moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath4 , as shown in tab .",

    ", due to the rapid decrease of radius as the central density increasing , the moment of inertia decreases very quickly , at a stellar mass about @xmath69 , the moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath70 , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : table2 ] . by the way , to a normal neutron star with mass of @xmath71 , its moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of redshift provides another way to constrain the radius and eos of compact star @xcite . to a low - mass neutron star near the minimum mass point , because of the smaller mass and the larger size , the surface gravitational redshift is very tiny , with an order of @xmath5 , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : table1 ] , which is approximately three orders of magnitude less than that of the normal neutron star @xcite .",
    "this result reminds us that if a very tiny reshift is observed related to a pulsar in the future , it is a clue that there is a low - mass neutrons star .",
    "it is also because of the rapid decrease of radius as the central density increasing , the redshift has a two orders of magnitude increase in the mass region from the minimum mass point to about @xmath73 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "up to date , all of the observations still can not confirm or rule out the existence of the low - mass neutron stars in the universe .",
    "moreover , we also can not rule out the existence of the low - mass neutron stars in theory . as most of the theoretical researches focused on the normal neutron stars ( with mass @xmath21 ) or the massive neutron stars ( with mass @xmath22 ) and few of them concentrated on the low - mass neutron stars ( with mass @xmath23 ) , and also",
    "because that there is a close relation between the low - mass neutron star and the eos of the inner crust matters , thus it is interesting to carry out an investigation on the low - mass neutron stars . in this paper , by employing four typical equation of states ( eoss ) for the inner crust , we investigate the detailed properties of the low - mass neutron stars . according to the well known fact that there is a big gap between the neutron stars and white dwarfs in the mass - radius sequence of compact stars , here we explicitly give the forbidden region for the central density and stellar radius to form a compact stars , that is , it is forbidden to form a compact star in the nature with a central density in the region from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and it is also forbidden to form a compact star with a radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km .",
    "it is found that for a low - mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities , the stellar mass is mainly determined by the softness of the eos at the higher density region ( @xmath2 ) while the stellar radius is dependent on the softness of the eos at lower density region ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "three quantities of the low - mass neutron stars ( the spin period at keplerian frequency , the moment of inertia and the redshift ) , are calculated and discussed .",
    "it is found that for a stable neutron star with stellar mass near the minimum mass , the keplerian period is several hundred millisecond , which is beyond the period of a millisecond pulsars , but still in the region of the observed pulsars periods ; the moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath4 ; and the surface gravitational redshift is in an order of @xmath5 .",
    "if the new observation apparatuses find the low - mass neutron star in the future , it will provide a way to constrain the eoss of nuclear matters at subnuclear densities strictly .",
    "thus it will be an interesting topic to investigate the inverse stellar structure problem to determine the equation of state of the matter at subnuclear densities .",

    "<S> by employing four typical equation of states ( eoss ) of the inner crust matters , the constraint on properties of low - mass neutron stars are theoretically investigated . </S>",
    "<S> based on the well known fact that there is a big gap between the neutron stars and white dwarfs in the mass - radius sequence of compact stars , here we explicitly point out the forbidden region for the central density and stellar radius to form a compact stars , that is , there is no compact star in the nature having central density in the region from about @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and there is also no compact star having a radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km . it is found that for a low - mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities , the stellar mass is mainly determined by the softness of the eos at the higher density region ( @xmath2 ) while the stellar radius is dependent on the softness of the eos at lower density region ( @xmath3 ) . for a stable neutron star with stellar mass near the minimum mass , </S>",
    "<S> the keplerian period is several hundred millisecond , the moment of inertia is in an order of @xmath4 , and the surface gravitational redshift is in an order of @xmath5 . </S>"
