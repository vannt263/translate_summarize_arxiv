    "the powerful emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to originate from gas accretion onto supermassive black holes ( bhs ) . in particular , a large fraction of type - i ( unobscured ) agns are powered by super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) that are characterised by a large eddington ratio , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath2 is the eddington luminosity ( nobuta et al .",
    "2012 ; kelly & shen 2013 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2014 ) . in the local universe",
    ", most objects of this type are classified as narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "they have prominent features of relatively narrow broad emission lines , strong lines , weak  lines , and very strong soft x - ray continuum ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boller 1996 ) .",
    "seambhs as central engines of nls1s are not entirely understood .",
    "it is thought that they contain slim accretion disks where photon trapping is very important ( e.g. , abramowicz 1988 ; wang & zhou 1999a ; ohsuga 2001 ) .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe has been extensively studied using type ia supernovae ( sne - ia ) ( riess 1998 ; perlmutter 1999 ) .",
    "much attention has been given to improve the measurements of sn - ia in two directions : 1 ) more detections of sn - ia at high redshifts and 2 ) high accuracy of sn - ia calibrated using cepheids ( freedman & madore 2010 ; riess 2011 ; freedman & madore 2013 ) .",
    "this method based on sn - ia , however , is limited to redshifts up to about @xmath3 , even for the next generation of extremely large telescopes both on the ground or in space ( hook 2012 ) .",
    "thus the exact dynamical state of the universe at higher redshifts is poorly known because of the lack of reliable luminous candles ( weinberg 2013 , kim et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the very high luminosity of agns makes them observable to very large distances , up to a redshift of about 7 ( mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ) . in principle",
    ", they could be used to follow the expansion of the early universe , beyond the distance accessible by the sne - ia method . however , the diversity in their intrinsic properties ( ho 2008 ; netzer 2013 ) hampers the use of most agns as distance indicators .",
    "there were several recent attempts , based on reverberation mapping ( rm ) of dust and gas near the central bh , to test the idea of using agns as standard cosmological candles .",
    "one of them makes use of the known correlation between the broad line region size ( @xmath4 ) and the continuum luminosities at 5100 ( @xmath5 ) found in @xmath6 agns ( kaspi 2000 ; bentz 2013 ; peterson 2013 ) .",
    "since @xmath4 is empirically determined by measuring the time lag between the h@xmath7 line and the visual continuum , it was suggested to derive this cosmologically independent size by monitoring a large number of agns at various redshifts ( horne 2003 ; teerikorpi 2011 ; watson 2011 ; czerny 2013 ; bentz 2013 ; melia 2014 , elvis & karovska 2002 ) .",
    "x - ray variability correlated with bh mass or luminosity has also been suggested to estimate cosmic distances ( la franca et al .",
    "2014 ) . similarly ,",
    "dust rm ( correlating the variable rest frame @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes ) was suggested to measure the innermost size of the dusty `` torus '' as an alternative size measure ( hoenig 2014 ; yoshii et al . 2014 ) .",
    "other suggestions involve radio megamasers ( humphreys et al .",
    "2013 ) , and other agn components ( see marziani & sulentic 2013 for a review of such methods ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that seambhs can be used as new probes of cosmological distances provided their mass is directly measured by methods such as rm .",
    "these objects show a unique dependence of their bolometric luminosity on the bh mass ( @xmath10 ) which , given a proper calibration , can be used to infer cosmological distances .",
    "this idea was first introduced by wang et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter w13 ) who showed that selecting seambhs by the slope of their x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed , wang et al .",
    "2004 ) , and estimating their bh mass using the @xmath11 relation ( e.g. , kaspi et al . 2000 , 2005 , bentz et al .",
    "2013 ) can be used to isolate a sub - group of such sources whose properties are suitable for measuring cosmological distances .",
    "however , w13 could not test their idea directly since accurate masses of seambhs were not available at the time .    in 2012",
    "we started a large rm campaign to measure bh mass in seambh candidates and to identify a large enough number of such sources that can be used to establish the method and to calibrate them as standard cosmological candles .",
    "the first paper in the series ( du et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter paper i ) described our observing project that was carried out in lijiang , china .",
    "paper i provides detailed information about the sample selection , telescope and spectrograph , the light curves and cross correlation ( cc ) analysis , and the mass measurements .",
    "the observations reported in the present paper were obtained during the same observing season reported in paper - i .",
    "their analysis revealed the presence of of three confirmed seambhs and one source which probably belongs to this group but with only an upper limit on the bh mass .. combining the new confirmed seambhs with the three objects reported in paper - i , and with several other seambhs identified in earlier rm experiments , results in a sample which is large enough to test the idea that such objects can be used as standard cosmological candles .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows :  2 describes various types of accretion disks in agns and gives the necessary approximations to estimate the accretion rate . ",
    "3 presents new rm observations and their analysis . in ",
    "4 we list the newly obtained mass and accretion rates , and explain our unique method of identifying seambhs . ",
    "5 gives a full description of the new method to measure distances with seambhs by way of a rigorous analysis of the errors associated with the method . in the last section",
    "we draw some conclusions regarding the merit of the new method and how can we improve it in the future .",
    "we consider three main types of accretion flows with angular momentum onto bhs .",
    "the properties of all such flows are determined by the dimensionless accretion rate , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency and @xmath15 the mass accretion rate . here",
    "@xmath16 is equivalent to the eddington ratio defined by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for solar composition gas .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "the accretion flow becomes advection - dominated in the radial direction and radiative cooling is inefficient and dominated by optically thin free - free emission ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "this situation probably applies to liners ( ho 2008 ) . for small to moderate @xmath20",
    ", the flow can be described as optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk , with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the height of the disk at a radius @xmath23 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; hereafter ss73 ) . in such cases ,",
    "the radiative efficiency @xmath14 depends on the radius of the last stable orbit which is determined by the bh spin .",
    "standard optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk models assume keplerian rotation in almost perfect circular orbits and very slow inward drift velocity .",
    "blackbody emission is very efficient at all radii and the dissipated energy is released locally ( see ss73 ) . while recent studies of thin disks show that the sed can differ , substantially , from the ss73 approximation ( due to e.g. , comptonization , radiative transfer in the atmosphere , etc ; frank 2002 , kato 2003 ) , none of these effects changes significantly the total energy released locally by the disk .",
    "the ss73 model has a canonical spectrum whose ( bh mass dependent ) low frequency sed is given approximately by @xmath24 . over this part of the spectrum one can use the standard disk equations to estimate the mass accretion rate , @xmath25 ( see e.g. , frank 2002 ; netzer 2013 ) , where @xmath26 is the inclination angle of the accretion disk to the line of sight , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the observed flux at @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath16 by the following expressions ( slightly adopted from earlier works by using our preferred wavelength of 5100 ) , @xmath30 we use @xmath31 to refer to @xmath32 derived in this way ( collin et al .",
    "2002 ) and assume an averaged @xmath33 for type - i agn .",
    "obviously @xmath31 and @xmath15 require the knowledge of the distance to the object ( the quantity we want to determine in this paper ) .",
    "this however is only required to justify that the objects we are selecting , at small redshift , are indeed seambhs and the associated uncertainties do not affect much the final results since the derived distances are insensitive to the exact values of @xmath16 ( see details below ) .",

    "yes / no    the third type of flow is the one with large @xmath20 . in this case",

    "the concept of slim disks was originally suggested by paczynsky & bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1981 ) and muchotrzeb & paczynski ( 1982 ) to get rid of the singularity of gas density at the inner edge of the ss73 disks .",
    "such systems have been extensively studied using vertically - averaged equations ( matsumoto 1984 ; muchotrzeb - czerny 1986 ) .",
    "abramowicz ( 1988 ) used the equations to treat slim disks as transonic flows of super - eddington accretion onto black holes . some of the recent studies include include szuszkiewicz ( 1996 ) , beloborodov ( 1998 ) , wang & zhou ( 1999a , b ) , fukue ( 2000 ) , mineshige ( 2000 ) , watarai & mineshige ( 2001 , 2013 ) , sadowski ( 2011 , 2013 ) and mckenney et al .",
    "slim disks are characterized by sub - keplerian rotation and transonic radial motion , which results in a non - localized energy conservation .",
    "these three properties are very different from the ss73 disks and there is no simple analytical solution except for the case of extremely high accretion rates , which can be described by a self - similar solution ( wang & zhou 1999a ; wang & netzer 2003 ) .    as a result of the fast radial transportation in slim disks , most photons",
    "will be trapped and advected into the bh before escaping .",
    "this results in inefficient emission of radiation and a big reduction in @xmath14 .",
    "some models suggest that in this case , @xmath58 ( wang & zhou 1999a ; mineshige 2000 ; sadowski et al .",
    "this leads to the so called `` saturated luminosity '' given by : @xmath59 where @xmath60~{\\ergs}m_{\\odot}^{-1}$ ] ( wang & zhou 1999a ; mineshige et al .",
    "thus @xmath61 over a large range of accretion rates around @xmath62 .",
    "given an accurately measured bh mass , one can deduce @xmath63 and hence the bh distance provided there is a way ( i.e. , a reliable bolometric correction factor ) to convert @xmath63 to the monochromatic luminosity of the disk at an accessible wavelength ( see  5 ) .",
    "detailed information of our rm campaign are given in paper i where we describe the observatory , the telescope , the spectrograph and the observing procedure in great detail .",
    "in short , targets were selected from the list of seambh candidates in w13 based on their coordinates and the slope of their 210 kev continuum requiring @xmath64 .",
    "all targets are classified , spectroscopically , as nls1s i.e. , 1 ) fwhm(h@xmath65 ; 2 ) /h@xmath66 ; 3 ) strong emission lines .",
    "only radio - quiet sources are selected to avoid contamination by relativistic jet emission to the optical continuum and , perhaps , emission lines line relative to the 5100  continuum and a couple of simultaneous @xmath67-ray flares .",

    "unlike the three other sources , mrk 486 has only wf / pc-1 exposure with a resolution which is too low to constrain the srsic index of its bulge .",
    "since a large fraction of nls1s contain pseudo - bulges ( ryan 2007 ; orban de xivry 2011 ; mathur 2012 ) , we fix the srsic index of the bulge component to 2.0 .",

    "it is too early to estimate this number given the limited number of sources ( 15 ) used here and the potential improvements of the method once better slim disk models are available .",
    "how likely is it to find a large number of seambhs at high redshift and measure their bh mass to the same level of accuracy achieved here ?",
    "several recent papers describe searches for super - eddington accreting massive black holes in large agn samples like the sdss ( nobuta 2011 ; trakhtenbrot & netzer 2012 ; kelly & shen 2012 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2014 ) .",
    "such studies use bh mass estimates based on the known @xmath369 relation in combination with an empirical bolometric correction factor like the one derived by marconi ( 2004 ) .",
    "all these studies show a large fraction of sources with @xmath370 , i.e. , likely to be powered by slim accretion disks . the recent work by netzer & trakhtenbrot ( 2014 ) adopt an approach similar to the one used here .",
    "the paper assumes that all agns are powered by accretion disks and used the estimated @xmath10 and @xmath15 to derive the value of @xmath190 .",
    "this is then used to investigate the fraction of slim accretion disks in the agn population .",
    "they found that at redshifts of about 0.7 and beyond , most of the sdss detected agns contain slim accretion disks .",
    "thus , there is no lack of suitable sources and the main obstacle is observational , to measure the mass of so many bhs by rm .",
    "several major improvements of the methodology used here are around the corner promising to achieve higher accuracy in estimating @xmath170 , @xmath311 and @xmath362 ; the main contributers to the uncertainty .",
    "estimates of @xmath170 and @xmath311 can be improved by better modelling of the blr using methods like maximum entropy reconstruction space ( horne 2004 ) and/or the markov chain monte carlo simulations ( mcmc ) ( pancoast 2011 , 2013 ; li 2013 ) .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath362 are due to theoretical limitations and incomplete understanding of slim accretion disks .",
    "the main ingredient that requires improvement is the treatment of the two - dimensional radiative transfer in the disk ( ohsuga 2002 , 2005 ; pountanen 2007 ; dotan & shaviv 2012 ; yang 2014 ) .",
    "better calculations will improve the estimates of @xmath14 in slim accretion disks and through it , the estimates of @xmath16 .",
    "as explained , the method does not depend much of such theoretical developments since @xmath362 can be calibrated experimentally .",

    "@xmath177 show that 7 of those are powered by slim accretion disks and hence are seambhs .",
    "the time lag in one of the 7 sources , mrk493 , is consistent with zero and hence removed from the rest of the analysis .",
    "literature search for sources with rm - based bh mass measurements revealed 9 more sources that are seambhs by our definition .",
    "we presented a novel method that can be used to infer cosmological distances using seambhs .",
    "we tested the method on our sample of 15 seambhs with @xmath296 and showed that it can be used to obtain cosmological distances .",
    "the key to the new method is the empirical calibration of the mean bolometric correction factor , and through it the saturated luminosity , by means of a baysian analysis .",
    "the resulting bolometric correction is in agreement with the simple version of slim disk models and the intrinsic scatter of the distance estimate is only 0.04 dex indicating that the unknown seambh physics is small and does not prevent us from using the method .    for seambhs of @xmath371 , the intrinsic bolometric luminosities are few @xmath372 , which is much higher than sne - ia ( leibundgut 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , sn - based cosmological distances at @xmath373 are rather uncertain due to small number statistics and such objects are hard to find at high-@xmath374 ( hook 2012 ) because of their faintness and/or the slow evolution of their progenitors ( kobayashi 2009 ) . in contrast , the number density of massive , very luminous fast accreting bhs is increasing with redshift ( trakhtenbrot & netzer 2012 ; nobuta 2012 ; kelly & shen 2013 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2014 ) and the saturated luminosity of slim disks is nearly independent of redshift - related factors such as the chemical composition of the accreted gas .",
    "future rm experiments based on the @xmath375 line , and perhaps other lines that will be proven to be good indicators for the motion of the blr gas , can be used to measure bh mass in a large number of high-@xmath374 seambhs .",
    "such a campaign will require large ground - based telescopes over a period of several years .",

    "<S> this is the second in a series of papers reporting on a large reverberation mapping ( rm ) campaign to measure black hole ( bh ) mass in high accretion rate active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to identify super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) and to use their unique properties to construct a new method for measuring cosmological distances . </S>",
    "<S> based on theoretical models , the saturated bolometric luminosity of such sources is proportional to the bh mass which can be used to obtain their distance . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on five new rm measurements and show that in four of the cases we can measure the bh mass and three of these sources are seambhs . together with the three sources from our earlier work </S>",
    "<S> , we now have six new sources of this type . </S>",
    "<S> we use a novel method based on a minimal radiation efficiency to identify nine additional seambhs from earlier rm - based mass measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we use a bayesian analysis to determine the parameters of the new distance expression , and the method uncertainties , from the observed properties of the objects in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the newly measured distances to the standard cosmological ones has a mean scatter of 0.14 dex , indicating that seambhs can be use as cosmological distance probes . with their high luminosity , long period of activity and large numbers at high redshifts , seambhs have a potential to extend the cosmic distance ladder beyond the range now explored by type ia supernovae . </S>"
