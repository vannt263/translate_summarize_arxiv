    "the electron transport via resonant tunnelling in mesoscopic systems has been the subject of extensive theoretical research due to recent development in fabrication of small electronic devices and their potential applications .",
    "some interest has been focused on the transport properties of a quantum dot ( qd ) under the influence of external time - dependent fields .",
    "new effects have been observed and theoretically described , e.g. , photon - assisted tunnelling through small quantum dots , @xcite , photon - electron pumps @xcite and others . in most theoretical investigations",
    "a qd placed between two leads was considered ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and the current flowing through a qd under periodic modulation of the qd electronic structure or periodic ( nonperiodic ) modulation of the tunnelling barriers and electron energy levels of both ( left and right ) leads was calculated .",
    "one of the important problems of the mesoscopic physics is the interference of the charge carries .",
    "this interference appears when two ( or more ) transmission channels for electron tunnelling exist .",
    "such possibility exists , e.g. in the electron transport through a qd embedded in a ring in the aharonov - bohm geometry and much theoretical interest has been paid to description of the phase coherence in this and related systems , e.g. refs . @xcite .",
    "another experimental situation in which the interference may occur can be realized in the scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "the recent experimental and theoretical studies with a low - temperature stm of a single atom deposited on a metallic surface showed the asymmetric fano resonances in the tunnelling spectra , e.g. refs .",
    "in the stm measurements tip probes the transmission of electrons either through the adsorbed atom or directly from the surface .",
    "the transport of electrons through both channels leads to an asymmetric shape of the conductance curves which is typical behavior for the fano resonance resulting from constructive and destructive interference processes .",
    "the quantum interference can be also observed in the mesoscopic system with multiple energy levels @xcite .",
    "a model which incorporates a weak direct nonresonant transmission through a qd as well as the resonant tunneling channel was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the large value of the transmission phase found in the experiment for the kondo regime of a qd @xcite .",
    "a number of works has been devoted to the problem of the electron transport in the multiterminal qd systems and here we mention only a few of them . in ref .",
    "@xcite the conductance of the n - lead system was considered showing that the kondo resonance at equilibrium is split into n-1 peaks . in ref .",
    "@xcite an explicit form for the transmission coefficient in the electron transport through a qd connected with three leads was found .",
    "the electron transport and shot noise in a multi - terminal coupled qd system in which each lead was disturbed by classical microwave fields were studied in ref .",
    "multiterminal qd systems or magnetic junctions were also intensively investigated in context of the spin - dependent transport , e.g. refs .",
    "a three - terminal qd system was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure of the nonequilibrium qd density of states ( splitting of the kondo resonance peak ) .",
    "the cross correlations of the currents and the differential conductance of the qd coupled with three leads described by the infinite - u anderson hamiltonian were considered in ref .",
    "the general formulation of the time - dependent spin - polarized transport in a system consisting of the resonant tunnelling structure coupled with several magnetic terminals was considered by zhao _",
    "et al_. @xcite and as an application of this formalism the electron transport in a system with two terminals under an ac external field was investigated .        in all papers",
    "mentioned above and in the studies relating to the electron transport through a qd with the additional ( bridge ) nonresonant transmission channels , the time - dependent external fields were not applied and the considered systems were driven out of the equilibrium only by means of a dc voltage bias ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite )    in this paper , we address the issue of a qd coupled with three leads with additional , nonresonant coupling between leads driven out of equilibrium by means of a dc voltage bias and time - dependent external fields .",
    "the qd is connected with three metal leads and one of these leads , say the left ( l ) lead , is coupled with the two remaining leads , say the first ( @xmath0 ) and the second ( @xmath1 ) right leads .",
    "the possible stm experimental setup corresponding to our model system is presented in fig .",
    "1 . in literature",
    ", different theoretical approaches have been developed to treat the time - dependent electron transport in the mesoscopic systems .",
    "the most popular nonequilibrium green s function method depends on the two time arguments and for time - dependent problems it is a rather difficult task to calculate them without any approximations ( e.g. beyond the wide - band limit ) .",
    "therefore , in our treatment of the time - dependent problems we use the evolution operator which , as a rule , essentially depends on one time argument ( e.g. refs .",
    "such an approach is especially well suited for the problem with time - dependent coupling between the qd and leads .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we start with the model and method for the derivation of the qd charge and currents . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results for the time - averaged currents and their derivatives with respect to the qd energy level position ( or equivalently , with respect to the gate voltage ) obtained for different time - dependence of the parameters characterizing the considered system .",
    "we consider also the transient current characteristics in the case of the rectangular - pulse modulations imposed on the qd - lead barriers .",
    "the last section presents the conclusions and in the appendix we give the short derivation of the evolution operator matrix elements needed in the qd charge and current calculations .",
    "we consider a qd coupled through the tunneling barriers @xmath2 @xmath3 to three metal leads .",
    "one of these leads , say the left lead ( l ) is coupled additionally with the remaining two leads , say the first and second right leads ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) by the tunneling barriers @xmath4 . in the following we will denote the wave vectors associated with the left lead by the letter @xmath5 and the wave vectors corresponding to the first and second right leads by the letters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath8 of the three metal leads may not be equal , and their difference is not necessarily small .",
    "we write the hamiltonian of the considered system in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 the operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the electrons in the corresponding leads and the dot , respectively . for simplicity",
    "the dot is characterised only by a single level @xmath14 and the intra - dot electron - electron coulomb interaction is neglected .",
    "the neglect of coulomb interaction is quite reasonable in some systems and , as we are going to concentrate on the investigations of the influence of the third lead ( in comaprison with the qd - two leads system ) and the additional tunneling channels between the leads on the time - dependent transport , then in the first step ignoring the coulomb interaction should be justified .",
    "we consider our mesoscopic system in the presence of external microwave ( mw ) fields which are applied to the dot and three leads . in most theoretical treatments of photon - assisted electron tunneling",
    "it is assumed that the driving field equals the applied external field .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated and the internal potential can be different from the applied potential @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences will be , e.g. the asymmetry between the corresponding left and right sidebands @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the time - dependent transport remains , however , unchanged and in our treatment as usual we assume that in the adiabatic approximation the energy levels of the leads and qd are driven with the frequency @xmath15 and the amplitudes @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and read @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively .    the time - evolution of the qd charge and the current flowing in the system can be described in terms of the time - evolution operator @xmath21 given by the equation of motion ( in the interaction representation ) : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the time ordering and the units such that @xmath26 have been chosen .",
