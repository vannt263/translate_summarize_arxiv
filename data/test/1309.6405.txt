    "quantum process tomography ( qpt ) @xcite is a way to completely characterize a quantum process .",
    "it is the main tool for experimental characterization of quantum gates , being developed for potential use in a quantum computer .",
    "qpt has been realized in numerous experiments , practically in all types of qubit systems , including , e.g. , nmr @xcite , linear optics @xcite , ion traps @xcite , and superconducting qubits @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mainly focus on qpt with superconducting qubits , even though our discussion is applicable to other systems as well .",
    "unfortunately , qpt requires resources , which scale exponentially with the number of qubits . for @xmath1 ( superconducting )",
    "qubits the number of initial states is usually @xmath2 ( or sometimes @xmath3 ) , and the number of `` measurement directions '' ( state tomography `` rotations '' ) for each initial state is typically @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) .",
    "each such setup typically requires a few hundred or a few thousand experimental runs . from this scaling it is easy to estimate that the qpt of a 1-qubit or a 2-qubit quantum gate requires a manageable number of experimental runs , while a 3-qubit qpt is rather difficult to realize , and the full qpt with 4 and more qubits seems to be impractical .",
    "the problem of exponential scaling of qpt resources with the number of qubits can be mitigated if we do not need full information about a quantum gate operation , but instead need only some information .",
    "thus a partial characterization of a multi - qubit operation is an important area of theoretical research @xcite .",
    "this includes randomized benchmarking @xcite , which typically provides only one number : the gate fidelity .",
    "randomized benchmarking becomes increasingly preferable for superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "another promising way to solve or a least alleviate the problem of exponential scaling is to use a compressed - sensing implementation of qpt @xcite .",
    "one more problem with qpt is its sensitivity to state preparation and measurement errors ( spam in the terminology of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "randomized benchmarking does not suffer from spam - errors , so this is another reason why this technique is increasingly popular .",
    "however , the obvious drawback of randomized benchmarking is that it gives only the total ( average ) error and does not give any information about particular kinds of error .",
    "hence , it does not tell us about the origin of a quantum gate imperfection .    in this paper",
    "we consider standard qpt , which gives full information about the quantum process .",
    "because of the scaling problem , we are essentially talking about quantum gates with less than 4 qubits , for which full qpt is a very useful tool .",
    "the standard way of representing qpt results is via the process matrix @xmath0 @xcite in the pauli basis ( see the next section ) .",
    "unfortunately , this matrix is a rather inconvenient object to work with .",
    "even though in principle it contains full information about the process , it does not show useful information in a straightforward way .",
    "thus the important problem of converting experimental qpt data into a useful characterization of particular decoherence processes @xcite is not quite simple .",
    "besides the standard matrix @xmath0 , there are other ways to represent qpt results .",
    "for example , they can be represented via the so - called pauli transfer matrix @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath5 is that it contains only real elements , from @xmath5 it is simple to see whether the quantum operation is trace preserving , also simple to see whether the process is unital , and for any clifford operation there is exactly one non - zero element in each row and column of @xmath5 with unit magnitude .    in this paper",
    "we discuss one more way of representing the experimental qpt results @xcite .",
    "it is essentially the standard @xmath0-matrix representation in the pauli basis , with the only difference being that we factor out the desired unitary operation @xmath6 , so that the error matrix @xmath7 describes only the imperfections of the experimental quantum gate .",
    "there are two natural ways to define such an error matrix ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) : we can assume that the @xmath6-operation is either before of after the error process ( see fig .  1 below ) .",
    "even though in theoretical analyses it is rather usual to separate the error channel and unitary operation , we are not aware of any detailed discussion of the qpt representation by the error matrices .",
    "as discussed in this paper , the error matrix @xmath7 ( as well as @xmath8 ) has a number of convenient properties .",
    "in particular , its main element is equal to the process fidelity @xmath9 , while other non - zero elements correspond to imperfections .",
    "unitary imperfections are directly given by the imaginary parts of the elements along the left column and/or top row .",
    "decoherence produces other elements , which have a relatively simple relation to kraus operators characterizing decoherence ( which are the operators in the lindblad equation ) .",
    "since the elements of the error matrix are small , most calculations can be approximated to first order , thus making them relatively simple .",
    "this includes a relatively simple rule for the composition of quantum operations and accumulation of the error - matrix elements due to the lindblad - form decoherence .",
    "the error - matrix representation has already been used in the experimental qpt @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in sec.[sec - standard ] we briefly review some properties of the standard process matrix @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec - chi - err ] we introduce the error matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and then in sec .  [ sec - properties ] some of their properties are discussed , including physical interpretation . in sec.[sec - comp ] we consider composition of the error processes . then in sec .",
    "[ sec - corr ] we discuss the use of the error matrix to find the necessary unitary correction to an experimental quantum gate . in sec .",
    "[ sec - lindblad - error ] we consider the contribution to the error matrix from decoherence described by the lindblad - form master equation .",
    "a possible identification of spam errors and their subtraction from the error matrix are discussed in sec.[sec - spam ] .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec - concl ] is the conclusion .",
    "two appendices discuss topics that are somewhat different from the main text . in appendix",
    "a we consider several simple examples of the @xmath0-matrix calculation , and in appendix b we discuss an intuitive interpretation of decoherence described by the lindblad - form master equation , unraveling the quantum dynamics into the `` jump '' and `` no jump '' scenarios .",
    "a linear quantum operation @xmath10 ( transforming initial density matrix @xmath11 into the final state @xmath12 ) is usually described via the process matrix @xmath0 ( which is hermitian , with non - negative eigenvalues ) , defined as @xcite _ fin= _ m , n _ mn e_m _ ine_n^ , [ chi - def]where the matrices @xmath13 form a basis in the space of complex @xmath14 matrices , which are the linear operators in the @xmath15-dimensional hilbert space of the problem . for example , for @xmath1 qubits @xmath16 ; therefore there are @xmath17 matrices @xmath13 , and the matrix @xmath0 has dimensions @xmath18 .",
    "( note that @xmath13 are operators in the space of wavefunctions , and these operators have the same dimension as density matrices . )",
    "even though in principle any basis @xmath19 ( not necessarily orthogonal @xcite ) can be used in eq .",
    "( [ chi - def ] ) , the most usual choice for a system of qubits is the use of pauli matrices . in this case for one qubit the basis @xmath19 consists of 4 matrices : i , x_x , y_y , z_z , and for several qubits the kronecker product of these matrices is used ; for example for two qubits @xmath20 .",
    "note that sometimes a different definition for @xmath21 is used : @xmath22 .",
    "also note that the basis of pauli matrices is orthogonal ( under the hilbert - schmidt inner product ) but not normalized @xcite , so that e_m|e_n ( e_m^e_n ) = _ mnd , d=2^n ; [ emen ] this is why normalization by @xmath15 in often needed in the qpt . in this paper",
    "we will always assume the pauli basis @xmath19 and use @xmath23 .",
    "therefore @xmath24 , but for clarity we will still write @xmath25 in formulas when appropriate .",
    "it is simple to find the matrix @xmath0 for a multi - qubit unitary operation @xmath6 .",
    "we first need to find its represention in the pauli basis , @xmath26 , and then compare @xmath27 with eq.([chi - def ] ) , which gives _",
    "mn= u_m u_n^ * , u_n = tr(ue_n^ ) , [ chi - u]where the star notation means complex conjugation and the expression for @xmath28 follows from the orthogonality property ( [ emen ] ) .",
    "calculation of the matrix @xmath0 for a quantum process with decoherence is usually significantly more cumbersome .",
    "some examples are considered in appendix a ( see also , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a process is called `` trace - preserving '' if the transformation ( [ chi - def ] ) preserves the trace of the density matrix , i.e.  if @xmath29 when @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath0 should satisfy the condition @xmath31 ( which gives @xmath2 real equations ) , and therefore @xmath0 is characterized by @xmath32 real parameters instead of @xmath33 parameters in the general ( non - trace - preserving ) case . in this paper",
    "we always assume a trace - preserving operation .",
    "the fidelity of a trace - preserving quantum operation compared with a desired unitary operation is usually defined as f_=tr ( ^des ) , [ fidelity]where @xmath34 is for the desired unitary operation and @xmath0 is for the actual operation ( it is easy to show that @xmath35 ) .",
    "this definition has direct relation @xcite 1-f_=(1-f_av ) to the average state fidelity @xmath36 , which assumes uniform averaging over all pure initial states .",
    "sometimes @xcite @xmath37 is called `` gate fidelity '' while @xmath9 is called `` process fidelity '' .",
    "characterization by @xmath38 is usually used in randomized benchmarking @xcite ; it is easy to see that @xmath39 .",
    "note that the fidelity definition ( [ fidelity ] ) requires unitary desired operation and trace - preserving actual operation . for a general ( non - unitary ) desired operation ( still assuming trace - preserving operations )",
    "it should be replaced with the `` uhlmann fidelity '' f_= ( tr)^2=(tr)^2 , which is essentially the same definition as for the fidelity between two density matrices @xcite .",
    "the process matrix @xmath0 for a non - trivial unitary operation typically has many non - zero elements ( e.g. , 16 elements for the two - qubit controlled-@xmath41 , controlled - not , and @xmath42 operations ) , and it is nice - looking on the standard bar ( `` cityscape '' ) chart used for visualization .",
    "however , a large number of non - zero elements ( we will call them `` peaks '' ) creates a problem in visual comparison between the desired and experimental @xmath0-matrices , especially for high - fidelity experiments .",
    "a natural way to make it easier to compare between the actual and desired operations is to show the difference between them , i.e. , to show the error .",
    "for example , it is possible to calculate and display the difference @xmath43 in the pauli basis .",
    "however , such element - by - element difference does not make much sense mathematically .",
    "instead , let us represent the actual quantum process as a _ composition _ of the desired unitary @xmath6 and the error process ( fig .  1 ) , and find the process matrix @xmath7 for this error operation .",
    "this essentially reduces the comparison between @xmath0 and desired @xmath6 ( we use a loose language here ) to the comparison between @xmath7 and the memory ( identity ) operation .     and @xmath8 via their relation to @xmath0 and the desired unitary operation @xmath6 .",
    "the time runs from left to right.,width=321 ]    so , the general idea is to convert the desired unitary @xmath6 into the memory operation , and this converts @xmath0 into the error process matrix @xmath7 .",
    "there are two ways of defining such error matrix : we can place the error process either before or after the desired unitary @xmath6 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , we define two error matrices : @xmath7 and @xmath8 using the relations [ see eq.([chi - def ] ) ] @xmath44    from fig .  1 it is obvious that the process @xmath7 can be represented as the composition of the inverse ideal unitary ( @xmath45 ) and the actual process @xmath0 after that .",
    "similarly , @xmath8 is the composition of @xmath0 and inverse unitary @xmath46 after that .",
    "hence , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent legitimate quantum processes and therefore they satisfy all the properties of the usual matrix @xmath0 ( see the previous section ) ; in particular , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive hermitian matrices .",
    "we will use the standard pauli basis for the error matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    using the composition relation ,",
    "the error matrices can be calculated from @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath47 in an experiment the error process matrices can be calculated either from @xmath0 using these equations or by directly applying the definitions ( [ chi - err - def ] ) and ( [ tilde - chi - err - def ] ) to the experimental data .",
    "for example , to find @xmath8 the measured final density matrices can be transformed numerically as @xmath48 and then the usual procedure of @xmath0 calculation can be applied .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath7 can be thought of as the @xmath0-matrix in the rotated basis @xmath49 instead of @xmath19 ; similarly , @xmath8 is formally the @xmath0-matrix in the basis @xmath50 ; however , we will not use this language to avoid possible confusion .    in the ideal ( desired )",
    "case both error processes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal to the perfect memory ( identity ) operation , @xmath51 , for which ^*i*_mn=_m0_n0 , [ memory]where with index 0 we denote the left column and/or the top row , which correspond to the unity basis element ( in the usual notation @xmath52 for one qubit , @xmath53 for two qubits , etc . ) ; the process matrix ( [ memory ] ) is given by eq .",
    "( [ chi - u ] ) with @xmath54 .",
    "so , in the ideal case the error matrices have only one non - zero element at the top left corner : @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , _ any other non - zero element in @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) indicates an imperfection of the quantum operation_. this is the main advantage in working with @xmath7 or @xmath56 instead of the usual matrix @xmath0 .",
    "there are also some other advantages discussed below .",
    "the standard process fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) for a trace - preserving operation has a very simple form for the error matrices .",
    "since @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are essentially the same operator in different bases , we have @xmath57 . therefore f_= _",
    "00^err= _ 00^err , [ f - chi - error]i.e .",
    "the process fidelity is just the height of the main ( top left ) element of the error matrix @xmath7 or @xmath56 .",
    "a systematic unitary error can be easily detected ( to first order ) in the error matrix @xmath7 or @xmath8 because it appears at a special location : it produces non - zero imaginary elements along the top row and left column of the matrix , i.e.  the elements @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( similarly for @xmath8 ) .",
    "to see this fact , let us assume that instead of the desired unitary operation @xmath6 , the quantum gate actually realizes a slightly imperfect unitary @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath7 corresponds to the unitary @xmath61 , which can be expanded in the pauli basis as @xmath62 . since @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . note that @xmath66 can always be chosen real because @xmath67 is defined up to an overall phase .",
    "now let us show that to first order all @xmath68 are purely imaginary .",
    "this follows from the first - order expansion of the equation @xmath69 , which gives @xmath70 .",
    "hence , @xmath71 for @xmath59 ( purely imaginary @xmath72 ) , and the difference @xmath73 is only of second order ( for a real @xmath66 ) .",
    "another way of showing that in the first order @xmath68 are imaginary is by using representation @xmath74 ( neglecting the overall phase ) with a hermitian matrix @xmath75 , so that the expansion @xmath76 contains all real coefficients , while to first order @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    now using eq .",
    "( [ chi - u ] ) we see that to first order the only non - zero elements ( except @xmath79 ) are ( ^err_n0)=-im(^ err_0n ) -i u^err_n , n0 .",
    "[ imag - unitary]note that the diagonal elements @xmath80 ( as well as the change of @xmath79 ) in this case are of second order . in particular , in this approximation @xmath81 .",
    "as discussed later , if decoherence causes a significant decrease of the fidelity @xmath9 , then a better approximation of the systematic unitary error effect is eq .",
    "( [ imag - unitary ] ) multiplied by the fidelity , ( ^err_n0)-i f_u^err_n .",
    "[ imag - unitary-2 ] using this equation it is possible to find @xmath82 from an experimental matrix @xmath7 and therefore estimate the systematic unitary error @xmath67 in the experiment .",
    "the same property ( [ imag - unitary ] ) [ and its version ( [ imag - unitary-2 ] ) corrected for @xmath9 ] can be shown for @xmath8 using the similar derivation for the unitary imperfection @xmath84 .",
    "the elements @xmath85 are different compared with the matrix elements of @xmath7 ; they are related via the equation @xmath86 or equivalent equation @xmath87 .",
    "decoherence produces additional small peaks in the error matrix @xmath7 ( and/or @xmath8 ) . as discussed later ,",
    "to first order these peaks are linear in the decoherence strength and simply additive for different decoherence mechanisms . therefore , to first order we have a weighted sum of different patterns in @xmath7 for different mechanisms .",
    "if these patterns for the most common decoherence mechanisms are relatively simple , then there is a rather straightforward way of extracting information on decoherence from experimental @xmath7 matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec - lindblad - error ] we will discuss the general way to calculate the first - order pattern for a particular decoherence mechanism ; for a practical quantum gate this pattern may contain many elements .",
    "a special role is played by the real elements along the top row and left column of @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) : they correspond to the gradual non - unitary ( `` bayesian '' ) evolution in the absence of the `` jumps '' due to decoherence ( in contrast to the imaginary elements , which correspond to the unitary imperfection ) ",
    "see discussion later .",
    "note that the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath7 are the error probabilities in the so - called pauli twirling approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore these elements can be used in simulation codes , which use the pauli twirling approximation for the analysis of quantum algorithms in multi - qubit systems .    concluding this section ,",
    "we emphasize that the error matrix @xmath7 ( and/or @xmath8 ) is just a minor modification of the standard @xmath0 matrix ; they are related by a linear transformation and therefore equivalent to each other . however , in the error matrix only one peak",
    "( at the top left corner ) corresponds to the desired operation , while other peaks indicate imperfections .",
    "this makes the error matrix more convenient to work with , when we analyze deviations of an experimental quantum operation from a desired unitary and try to extract information about the main decoherence mechanisms .",
    "in this paper we always assume high - fidelity operations , 1-f_1 , [ high - fid]so that the first - order approximation of imperfections is quite accurate . since the error matrix @xmath7 is positive , its off - diagonal elements have the upper bound |^err_mn| .",
    "( the same is true for @xmath8 , but for brevity we discuss here only @xmath7 . )",
    "therefore for a high - fidelity operation ( [ high - fid ] ) only the elements in the left column and top row can be relatively large , @xmath88 , while other off - diagonal element have a smaller upper bound , @xmath89 , because all diagonal elements except @xmath90 are small .",
    "actually , it is possible to show ( see below ) that @xmath91 are also small , @xmath92 , so only @xmath93 can be relatively large .",
    "the elements @xmath93 and @xmath94 play a special role because a unitary imperfection produce them in the first order , while other elements are of second order [ see eq .",
    "( [ chi - u ] ) and discussion in the previous section ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath95 and @xmath94 can approach @xmath96 if the error is dominated by the unitary imperfection .",
    "the physical intuition in analyzing the error of a quantum gate is that the ( small ) infidelity @xmath97 comes from small unitary imperfections and from rare but `` strong '' decoherence processes , which cause `` jumps '' that significantly change the state . as discussed later ,",
    "this picture should also be complemented by small non - unitary state change in the case when no jump occurred ( this change is essentially the quantum bayesian update @xcite due to the information that there was no jump ) .",
    "it is not easy to formalize this intuition mathematically ; however , there is a closely related procedure .",
    "let us diagonalize the error matrix @xmath7 , so that ^err= tdt^-1 , [ diag - chi - err]where @xmath98 is a unitary @xmath99 matrix and @xmath100 is the diagonal matrix containing @xmath101 real eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
    "these eigenvalues are non - negative , and we can always choose @xmath98 so that in @xmath102 they are ordered as @xmath103 .",
    "the sum of the eigenvalues is equal 1 ( since we consider trace - preserving operations ) and the largest eigenvalue @xmath104 is close to 1 because @xmath105 .",
    "[ here @xmath106 because any diagonal element of a hermitian matrix should be in between the largest and smallest eigenvalues , as follows from expanding the corresponding basis vector in the eigenbasis . ]",
    "all other eigenvalues are small because @xmath107 .",
    "the diagonalization ( [ diag - chi - err ] ) directly gives the evolution representation via the kraus operators @xcite , @xmath108 in which the operators @xmath109 form an orthogonal basis , @xmath110 [ see eq .",
    "( [ emen ] ) ] because @xmath98 is unitary .",
    "recall that @xmath6 is the desired unitary gate ",
    "see eq.([chi - err - def ] ) .",
    "the main term in the kraus - operator representation ( [ kraus - representation ] ) is the term with @xmath111 ; let us show that @xmath112 ( up to an overall phase , which can always be eliminated ) ; this means @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath59 [ note that @xmath115 because @xmath98 is unitary ; therefore it is sufficient to show that @xmath113 ] .",
    "this can be done in the following way .",
    "since ^err_mn=_k _ k a_m^(k)(a_n^(k))^ * , [ chi - via - a]the fidelity is f_=_k_k |a_0^(k)|^2 .",
    "[ f - sum - k ] the contribution of the terms with @xmath117 to the fidelity is at least smaller than @xmath97 because this is the bound for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for a unitary @xmath98 ( this contribution is actually even much smaller , as discussed below ) .",
    "therefore @xmath120 , and so @xmath121 .",
    "choosing real @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath113 , and therefore @xmath123 .    since @xmath124 is close to @xmath125 and other @xmath109 are orthogonal to @xmath124 , the components @xmath126 are small for @xmath117 .",
    "using the relation @xmath127 ( since @xmath98 is unitary ) , we find the bound @xmath128 . now using @xmath129 , @xmath130 ( see the previous paragraph )",
    ", we obtain @xmath131 , neglecting the terms of the order @xmath132 .",
    "this means that the contribution to the fidelity ( [ f - sum - k ] ) from the kraus operators with @xmath133 is limited at least by @xmath134 [ neglecting the order @xmath135 , and therefore a good approximation for the fidelity is f__0 |a_0^(0)|^2 , 1-f_(1-|a_0^(0)|^2 ) + ( 1-_0 ) , [ f - separation]which corresponds to the intuitive separation of the infidelity @xmath97 into the `` coherent '' error @xmath136 and the error @xmath137 due to rare but strong decoherence `` jumps '' .",
    "thus the kraus - operator representation ( [ kraus - representation ] ) can be crudely interpreted in the following way .",
    "after the desired unitary @xmath6 , we apply the kraus operator @xmath112 with the probability @xmath111 , while with small remaining probabilities @xmath138 we apply very different ( orthogonal to @xmath124 ) kraus operators @xmath109 .",
    "imperfection of @xmath124 ( compared with @xmath139 ) leads to the `` coherent '' error @xmath136 with @xmath140 .",
    "other kraus operators are practically orthogonal to @xmath141 , so they correspond to `` strong decoherence '' and practically always lead to an error , which happens with the total probability @xmath142 , thus explaining eq .",
    "( [ f - separation ] ) . while this interpretation seems to be quite intuitive ,",
    "there are two caveats .",
    "first , it is incorrect to say that @xmath109 is applied with the probability @xmath138 .",
    "instead , we should say @xcite that the evolution scenario |_in , _ in occurs with the probability @xmath143 , which depends on the initial state and is equal to @xmath138 only on average , @xmath144 , after averaging over pure initial states .",
    "[ this can be proven by using @xmath145 and @xmath146 . ]",
    "note that the operators @xmath109 can violate the inequality @xmath147 , even though @xmath148 is always satisfied .",
    "the second caveat is that @xmath124 is not necessarily unitary , as would be naively expected for the separation into a coherent operation and decoherence .",
    "the non - unitary part of @xmath124 can be interpreted as due to the absence of jumps @xmath149 , similar to the null - result evolution @xcite ( see below and also discussions in sec .  [ sec - lindblad - error ] and appendix b ) .",
    "we may include both contributions ( imperfect unitary part and non - unitary part of @xmath124 ) into what we call the `` coherent error '' , so it is characterized by the difference between @xmath124 and @xmath139 ( probably it is better to call it the `` gradual error '' ) . with understanding of these two caveats ,",
    "the discussed above interpretation of the kraus representation ( [ kraus - representation ] ) can be useful for gaining some intuition .",
    "note that the contribution to @xmath7 [ see eq.([chi - via - a ] ) ] from the imperfection of the main kraus operator @xmath124 mainly causes the elements @xmath150 in the top row and left column of the error matrix ( other elements are of the second order in the imperfection ) .",
    "in contrast , other ( `` decoherence jump '' ) operators @xmath109 mainly produce other elements of @xmath151 ; their contribution to @xmath152 is limited by @xmath153 , as follows from the positivity of @xmath154 , which gives @xmath155 , and the derived above inequality @xmath156 .",
    "significant contributions to the diagonal elements of @xmath151 may come from both @xmath124 and @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the following approximate procedure to crudely separate the error matrix , ^err=^coh + ^dec , ^coh_mn= _ 0 a_m^(0)(a_n^(0))^ * , [ chi - coh - dec]into the `` coherent '' ( or `` gradual '' ) part @xmath157 and `` strong decoherence '' @xmath158 [ see eq .",
    "( [ chi - via - a ] ) ] .",
    "we first estimate the `` coherent probability '' @xmath104 as _ 0 f_/ ( 1-_n>0    estimation @xmath159 . using @xmath104 and @xmath160",
    "we can construct @xmath161 , while the remaining part of @xmath7 is @xmath158 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath80 with @xmath59 ( error probabilities ) are thus separated into the contributions @xmath162 due to `` strong decoherence '' .",
    "a further simplification of this procedure is to approximate the coherent part as @xmath163 for @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "one more useful approach for the intuitive understanding of @xmath7 elements along the left column and top row is the following . using the completeness relation ( [ kraus - representation ] )",

    "there are two kinds of the relaxation processes ( up and down ) with the rates @xmath443 and @xmath444 satisfying the standard relations @xmath445 and @xmath446 , where @xmath98 is temperature and @xmath447 is the energy difference between the qubit states ; this gives @xmath448 .",
    "correspondingly , there are three scenarios with the kraus operators @xmath449 then in a similar way as above we find the @xmath0-matrix elements : @xmath450      phase evolution commutes with the energy relaxation , therefore we may apply @xmath41-rotation over a random angle @xmath381 after the energy relaxation .",
    "the @xmath41-rotation does not affect scenario(s ) with relaxation , so we need to change only the kraus operator for the no - relaxation scenario : @xmath451 , then calculate the corresponding elements of the @xmath0-matrix in the same way as above and average over @xmath381 .",
    "therefore , the elements @xmath452 , @xmath453 , @xmath454 , @xmath455 due to energy relaxation will not be affected by the pure dephasing ( since they come from the relaxation scenario ) .",
    "the calculation shows that the elements @xmath441 and @xmath442 are also not affected when @xmath456 ( satisfied for a symmetric noise ) , so the only affected elements are @xmath419 and @xmath418 , which are non - zero for both decoherence mechanisms . using again the condition @xmath457 , it is easy to find @xmath458 where @xmath459 and @xmath460 correspond to pure dephasing and energy relaxation , and were calculated above [ eqs.([deph-1 ] ) and ( [ rel - temp-1])([rel - temp-5 ] ) ] . for completeness let us also show the unaffected elements : @xmath461    another way of deriving eqs.([deph+rel - zz])([deph+rel - iz ] ) is the following .",

    "_ mn^deph e_m e_m _",
    "ine_n^e_n^. [ chi - composition]even though a product of pauli matrices is a pauli matrix ( possibly with a phase factor ) and therefore @xmath0-matrix of a composition of operations can in principle be calculated in a straightforward way , usually this is a very cumbersome procedure . however ,",
    "in our case the matrix @xmath459 has only two non - zero elements ( @xmath462 and @xmath463 ) , so the calculation is not very long and leads to eqs.([deph+rel - zz])([deph+rel - iz ] ) .",
    "now when we have explicit formulas for the @xmath0-matrix elements , which depend on @xmath439 , temperature , and @xmath464 , let us discuss again how to extract @xmath464 from the ramsey - fringes data . in the presence of energy relaxation ( at arbitrary temperature ) the ramsey oscillations are @xmath465 therefore , if the energy relaxation time @xmath324 is measured separately , the ramsey data give the value of @xmath466 at any time @xmath412 .",
    "this value can be used to calculate the @xmath0-matrix even in the case of arbitrary non - exponential dephasing .",
    "now let us discuss the @xmath0-matrix at a relatively short time @xmath412 and neglect the terms quadratic in time .",

    "in this appendix we discuss the technique of kraus operators applied to the evolution described by the standard lindblad - form master equation .",
    "we show that each lindblad term describes two evolutions : a `` jump '' process with some rate and a continuous evolution between the jumps caused by the absence of jumps",
    ". such interpretation can be useful in intuitive analysis of decoherence processes .",
    "a markovian evolution of a quantum system is usually described by the lindblad - form master equation [ for convenience we copy eq.([lindblad - evol ] ) here ] = - [ h , ] + _ n _ n ( b_nb_n^- b_n^b_n- b_n^b_n ) , [ lindblad]where the first term describes the unitary evolution due to the hamiltonian @xmath472 , while the @xmath184th decoherence mechanism is described by the `` rate '' @xmath473 ( real number with dimension s@xmath474 ) and dimensionless operator @xmath475 .",
    "note that mathematically @xmath473 can be absorbed by redefining @xmath476 ; however , we do not do this because @xmath473 and @xmath475 have separate physical meanings .",
    "our goal here is to discuss a simple physical interpretation of the decoherence terms in the lindblad equation . for simplicity",
    "let us neglect the unitary evolution ( @xmath477 ) and consider first only one decoherence mechanism ; then we can omit the index @xmath184 ( summation over @xmath184 is simple ) .",
    "it is easy to check that the term @xmath478 corresponds to the abrupt change ( `` jump '' ) of the state | = , = , [ jump]which occurs with the rate ( jump probability per second ) = || b|||^2 , = tr ( b b^ ) = tr ( b^b ) .",
    "[ rate](here we show the formulas in both the wavefunction and density matrix languages ; the wavefunction language is usually more convenient to use . )",
    "note a possible confusion in terminology : both @xmath322 and @xmath479 are rates ; to distinguish them let us call @xmath322 the `` process rate '' or just `` rate '' , while @xmath479 will be called `` jump rate '' .",
    "the remaining term @xmath480 in the lindblad form corresponds to the jump process ( [ jump ] ) _ not happening_. the physical reason of this evolution `` when nothing happens '' is the same as the partial collapse in the null - result measurement @xcite : this is essentially the bayesian update @xcite , which accounts for the information that the jump did not happen .",
    "therefore , _ the physical meaning of the lindblad form is the description of two scenarios : the jump process either happening or not happening .",
    "_    to see this mathematically , let us use the technique of kraus operators @xcite , in which the evolution @xmath481 is unraveled into the probabilistic mixture of `` scenarios '' described by kraus operators @xmath109 ,    @xmath482 [ in the wavefunction language @xmath483 .",
    "the sum of the probabilities should be equal to 1 , which leads to the completeness relation _ k a_k^a_k = . [ completeness]note the change of notations compared with eq.([kraus - representation ] ) .    during a short time",
    "@xmath286 the evolution ( [ lindblad ] ) can be described by two scenarios : the jump either occurs or not , with the corresponding kraus operators @xmath484 and @xmath435 . for the jump scenario a_jump= b , so that @xmath485 gives the same contribution to @xmath486 as the term @xmath487 in eq.([lindblad ] ) . the no - jump kraus operator @xmath435 should satisfy the completeness relation ( [ completeness ] ) , @xmath488 . using the bayesian - update approach @xcite in which @xmath489 , we find @xmath490 note that @xmath491 is a positive hermitian operator and @xmath492 is also a positive operator . a square root of a positive operator is defined via taking square roots of its eigenvalues in the diagonalizing basis .",
    "this is why in eq .",
    "( [ a - no ] ) we deal with operators essentially as with numbers .    using eq .",
    "( [ a - no-2 ] ) for @xmath435 , we find in the linear order a_no a_no^- t b^b - t b^b , [ a - no - evol]with this linear - order approximation becoming exact at @xmath493 .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ a - no - evol ] ) gives the evolution described by the term @xmath494 in the lindblad form ( [ lindblad ] ) .",
    "thus we have shown that the lindblad - form master equation ( [ lindblad ] ) with one decoherence term describes a jump process @xmath283 [ see eq .",
    "( [ jump ] ) ] occurring with the jump rate ( probability per second ) @xmath495 . in the case of several decoherence mechanisms",
    "there are several kraus operators @xmath496 describing the jumps @xmath497 during a short duration @xmath286 .",
    "the no - jump kraus operator in this case is @xmath498 , which contributes to all terms @xmath499 in eq .",
    "( [ lindblad ] ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ a - no ] ) and its generalization for several processes is not the unique form for @xmath435 , which follows from the completeness relation ( [ completeness ] ) .",
    "it is formally possible to add an arbitrary unitary rotation @xmath6 , so that @xmath500 , which does not affect @xmath501 .",
    "using a natural assumption that @xmath502 at @xmath503 , we can expand @xmath6 in the linear order as @xmath504 , where @xmath505 should be a hermitian matrix .",
    "then @xmath506 acquires the extra term @xmath507\\delta t$ ] , from which we see that @xmath505 is essentially an addition to the hamiltonian @xmath472 .",
    "so the formalism permits a change of the hamiltonian due to decoherence , and therefore @xmath472 in eq.([lindblad ] ) should be considered as the effective hamiltonian ( which may include the `` lamb shift '' mechanism ) .        for a qubit relaxation from the excited state @xmath424 to the ground state @xmath421 with the rate @xmath508 , the jump operator is @xmath509 , where the ground state corresponds to the upper line , so that @xmath510 , @xmath511 . in this case @xmath512 , so that the no - jump evolution during time @xmath286 changes the qubit state as |0+|1 , [ qubit - relax - no - jump]while in the case of jump obviously @xmath513 can be taken into account in the similar way using an additional lindblad - form term .",
    "the physical mechanism of the markovian pure dephasing in superconducting qubits is the fast ( `` white noise '' ) fluctuations of the qubit energy , which leads to random fluctuations of the qubit phase @xmath514 , so that the random phase shift @xmath515 accumulated during a short time @xmath286 has the gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath516 , where @xmath325 is the dephasing time .",
    "it is easy to check that the correct evolution due to pure dephasing [ @xmath517 , @xmath518 , @xmath519 can be reproduced using the lindblad equation ( [ lindblad ] ) with @xmath520 and @xmath521 .",
    "this means that instead of the physically correct picture of continuous change of @xmath381 , we may use a completely different picture : random jumps of the phase @xmath381 by @xmath344 , |0+|1|0-|1 , occuring with the jump rate [ see eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) ] @xmath522 , which in this case is independent of the qubit state and equal to @xmath322 .",
    "note that @xmath523 , so in this case there is no no - jump evolution .",
    "since both pictures lead to the same evolution of @xmath524 , we can use any of them , depending on convenience in a particular problem .",
    "one more picture which can be used for pure dephasing is the `` random measurement of state @xmath421 '' , for which @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "it is easy to see that it leads to the same lindblad equation , but has different jump process and non - trivial no - jump evolution .",
    "obviously , we can also use @xmath527 and @xmath526 for the same master equation ( see the brief discussion in sec.[sec - lindblad - error ] of the transformation @xmath528 in the lindblad equation ) .",
    "the decay of a resonator state is usually characterized by the energy decay rate @xmath529 , so that in the qubit terminology @xmath530 . the standard lindblad form ( [ lindblad ] ) in this case has @xmath531 and @xmath532 , where @xmath533 is the annihilation operator , @xmath534 .",
    "the jump evolution is then | , [ res - jump]with the jump rate [ see eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) ] @xmath535 , where @xmath536 is the average number of photons .",
    "the no - jump evolution during time @xmath286 is then _",
    "n _ n |n , [ res - no - jump]which is similar to the no - jump evolution ( [ qubit - relax - no - jump ] ) for the qubit .",
    "note that the probability of the no - jump evolution is given by the squared norm , @xmath537 , so that the sum of the jump and no - jump probabilities is 1 .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the special case : evolution of a coherent state , @xmath538 .",
    "since it is the eigenstate of the operator @xmath533 , the jump evolution ( [ res - jump ] ) does not change the state , while the continuous no - jump evolution essentially changes the parameter @xmath539 in time , @xmath540 .",
    "therefore the energy decay is due to the no - jump evolution only . in this",
    "( very unusual ) case a pure initial state remains pure because the jump does not change the state and therefore it is essentially a one - scenario ( no - jump ) evolution .",
    "the standard lindblad - form evolution for the resonator with @xmath531 and @xmath532 can be understood in the following way .",
    "let us assume that @xmath529 is the coupling with the outside modes , and let us imagine ( gedankenexperiment ) that we use an ideal photon detector , which clicks every time when a photon escapes from the resonator . when the detector clicks , we know that there is one photon less in the resonator . however , all transitions @xmath541 are indistinguishable ( because the energy levels are equidistant ) , and therefore the bayesian update of the quantum state @xcite involves only the rates , which are proportional to @xmath184 , _",
    "it is easy to see that this bayesian update coincides with the jump process ( [ res - jump ] ) , and therefore the lindblad - form evolution can be interpreted as being due to an outside measurement with a single - photon detector .",
    "[ note that the lindblad - form master equation describes the ensemble - averaged evolution ; this is why we are free to choose any measurement model , in contrast to the case of individual ( selective ) evolution , which depends on what is actually measured . ]      the energy relaxation ( at zero temperature ) in a slightly ahnarmonic superconducting 3-level qubit is sometimes described by essentially the same lindblad equation as for the resonator , with @xmath542 and @xmath532 , so that latexmath:[$b|2\\rangle = \\sqrt{2 } \\ ,    @xmath511 .",
    "this is actually incorrect .",
    "the reason is that the qubit is anharmonic , and therefore in the described above gedankenexperiment it is in principle possible to distinguish transitions @xmath544 where the top row corresponds to the state @xmath421 and the bottom row corresponds to @xmath545 .",
    "the formula @xmath546 is not exact because of anharmonicity . if for more accuracy we want to take into account direct transitions @xmath547)([3-level-2 ] ) , the ( incorrect ) one - process description ( with @xmath532 ) adds the extra term @xmath548 into @xmath549 , while other terms in these two approaches coincide .    concluding this appendix",
    ", we emphasize that unraveling of the lindblad - form evolution into the `` jump '' and `` no - jump '' processes is often useful for gaining intuition in the analysis of decoherence , and it may also be useful in analytical and numerical calculations .",
