    ", the tff can be determined .",
    "decays of light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath10 ) into a real and a virtual photon are ideally suited for testing the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model  @xcite . in vmd",
    ", the coupling of a virtual photon to a pseudoscalar meson is described via an intermediate virtual vector meson @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman1:a ] ) .",
    "this mechanism is especially strong in the timelike momentum - transfer region , where a resonancelike behavior near momentum transfer @xmath12 of the virtual photon arises because the virtual vector meson reaches the mass shell  @xcite .",
    "the tffs of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons are strongly related to the mixing of these particles  @xcite . with quarks as inner degrees of freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , several symmetry - breaking mechanisms ( u(1 )",
    "axial anomaly and dynamical and explicit chiral - symmetry breaking ) lead to a mixing of the pure su(3 ) states @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the quark - flavor basis to form the @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons . in the picture of vmd , the coupling of light vector - meson resonances ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) to the virtual photon influences the slope of the tff .",
    "since the @xmath17 meson is a pure @xmath18 state , measuring the tff precisely gives stringent constraints on the strange - quark content of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a possible gluonic contribution to @xmath3 and @xmath10 is currently under discussion  @xcite , which could be investigated with tffs .",
    "if such an effect existed , it would have to be included in @xmath3-@xmath10 mixing schemes .",
    "exploring the tffs of the @xmath3 and @xmath10 mesons sheds new light not only on the quark structure of these particles but also on the interplay of the symmetry - breaking mechanisms that were mentioned above .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that tffs might be related to the contribution of the hadronic light - by - light scattering to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath19 , which is one of the limiting contributions for the standard model ( sm ) calculation of this precision observable .",
    "since the contribution of the hadronic light - by - light scattering can not be accessed directly through experiments , models describing @xmath20 transitions are needed to calculate this contribution . a diagram showing one of the leading contributions to the correction due to the hadronic light - by - light scattering",

    "two vertices appear where pseudoscalar mesons couple to virtual photons and the external magnetic field .",
    "experiments can measure such vertices in other processes , e.g. , decays of pseudoscalar mesons , and this way act as a testing ground for vmd or vmd - based models describing @xmath20 transitions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and provide appropriate input parameters for these models .",
    "thus , the models describing the @xmath20 transitions have to be tested as precisely as possible to reduce the uncertainty in the sm prediction for @xmath19 .",
    "calculations of the contribution from the hadronic light - by - light scattering to @xmath19 are performed in the spacelike momentum - transfer region , although it is also possible to do in the timelike regime .",
    "the dominant energy region for such calculations turns out to be the low - energy region up to 1  gev@xmath21 , exactly where the slope of the tff is the relevant parameter .",
    "since the tff is continuous at @xmath22  gev@xmath21 , this value can be determined in both the momentum regions .",
    "it is currently not possible to reach the lowest @xmath23 values experimentally in the spacelike regime . on the contrary ,",
    "determining tffs with high precision is possible from dalitz decays .",
    "thus , measurements of the timelike tff with dalitz decays are important for fixing the slope at @xmath22  gev@xmath21 , especially by studying decays like @xmath24 with the @xmath25 lepton pair , making it possible to reach a much lower value of @xmath26 than with @xmath27 .",
    "experimentally , tffs can be explored through different techniques in three separate momentum - transfer regions .",

    "fig : feynman2:a ] ) .",
    "the lowest timelike @xmath23 region , @xmath31 , is accessible only through studying meson decays , where @xmath32 is the mass of the two leptons from the virtual - photon decay ( see fig .",

    "so far , the most precise measurement of the parameter @xmath2 in the dalitz decay @xmath0 was reported in 2011 by the a2 collaboration at mami  @xcite .",
    "the value obtained , @xmath47  gev@xmath5 , is based on an analysis of @xmath48 @xmath0 decays . at the same time , an analysis of the @xmath6 decay by the na60 collaboration allowed a determination of @xmath2 with significantly better statistical accuracy . in 2009 , the na60 collaboration reported the value @xmath49",
    "gev@xmath5 based on an analysis of @xmath50 @xmath6 decays in peripheral in  in data  @xcite .",
    "recently , na60 presented an improved preliminary result , @xmath51  gev@xmath5 , based on an analysis of @xmath52 low - mass muon pairs produced in @xmath53 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the major shortcoming of using the @xmath6 dalitz decay for the determination of the @xmath3 tff is the inability to measure @xmath54 below @xmath55 .",
    "this limitation does not allow a check of whether the experimental points approach @xmath56 at @xmath44 , as it was assumed in their final fit .",
    "besides , the measurement of the na60 collaboration is based on fitting all possible contributions to the entire spectrum of the @xmath27 invariant masses , without detecting the final - state photon and reconstructing the @xmath3 meson from its decay products .    using the @xmath0 dalitz decay for the determination of the @xmath3 tff",
    "allows for measuring @xmath54 much closer to @xmath44 and to fit a function with two free parameters to the data points .",
    "one of the function parameters is @xmath2 itself ; the other reflects the uncertainty in the general normalization of the data points .",
    "such uncertainty could emerge , for example , from the experimental determination of the number of @xmath3 mesons produced , which is needed for calculating @xmath54 .",
    "the results of the work presented in this paper are based on an analysis of @xmath57 @xmath0 decays from a total of @xmath58 @xmath3 mesons produced in the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "about one - third of these data have already been used in the previous analysis by the a2 collaboration at mami  @xcite .",
    "compared to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , further increase in statistic was also achieved through exploiting the full production energy range for @xmath3 mesons , using , unlike the former analysis , a kinematic - fit technique for event identification , and substantially revising the criteria used for event selection .",
    "the process @xmath59 was measured using the crystal ball ( cb )  @xcite as the central spectrometer and taps  @xcite as a forward spectrometer .",
    "these detectors were installed in the energy - tagged bremsstrahlung photon beam of the mainz microtron ( mami )  @xcite .",
    "the photon energies were determined by the glasgow - mainz tagging spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the cb detector is a sphere consisting of 672 optically isolated nai(tl ) crystals , shaped as truncated triangular pyramids , which point toward the center of the sphere .",
    "the crystals are arranged in two hemispheres that cover 93% of @xmath60 sr , sitting outside a central spherical cavity with a radius of 25  cm , which is designed to hold the target and inner detectors . in this experiment , taps was arranged in a plane consisting of 384 baf@xmath61 counters of hexagonal cross section . it was installed 1.5  m downstream of the cb center and covered the full azimuthal range for polar angles from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .    the present analysis is based on the same data set that was used to study the @xmath64 decay  @xcite and to measure the @xmath1 differential cross sections  @xcite . the experiment was conducted in 2007 by using the 1508-mev electron beam from the mainz microtron , mami - c  @xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons , produced by the 1508-mev electrons in a 10-@xmath65 m cu radiator and collimated by a 4-mm - diameter pb collimator , were incident on a 5-cm - long liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath61 ) target located in the center of the cb .",
    "the total amount of the material around the target , including the kapton cell and the 1-mm - thick carbonfiber beamline , was equivalent to 0.8% of a radiation length @xmath66 . in the present measurement , it was essential to keep the material budget as low as possible to diminish the @xmath67 background with conversion of real photons into @xmath25 pairs .",
    "the energies of the incident photons were analyzed up to 1402  mev by detecting the postbremsstrahlung electrons in the glasgow - mainz tagger  @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution of the tagged photons is mostly defined by the width of the tagger focal - plane detectors and by the electron - beam energy . for the present beam energies , a typical width of a tagger channel was about 4  mev .",
    "the target was surrounded by a particle identification ( pid ) detector  @xcite used to distinguish between charged and neutral particles .",
    "it was made of 24 scintillator bars ( 50 cm long , 4 mm thick ) arranged as a cylinder with a radius of 12 cm .",
    "the experimental data were taken with a trigger that required , first , the total - energy deposit in the cb to exceed @xmath68  mev and , second , the number of so - called hardware clusters in the cb ( multiplicity trigger ) to be larger than two . depending on the data - taking period ,",
    "events with cluster multiplicity two were prescaled with a different rate .",
    "taps was not in the multiplicity trigger for these experiments .",
    "more details on the experimental resolutions of the detectors and other conditions during these measurements are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . a general sketch of the cb , taps , and pid",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb_taps_pid ] .",
    "candidates for the process @xmath59 were extracted from the analysis of events having three and four clusters reconstructed in the cb and taps together .",
    "the three - cluster events were analyzed assuming that the final - state proton was not detected .",
    "the selection of event candidates was based on the kinematic - fit technique .",
    "the details of the kinematic - fit parametrization of the detector information and resolution are given in ref .",
    "since electromagnetic ( e / m ) showers from electrons and positrons are very similar to those of photons , the hypothesis @xmath69 was tested to identify the @xmath70 candidates .",
    "the events that satisfied this hypothesis with a probability greater than 2% were accepted as possible reaction candidates . the kinematic - fit output was used to reconstruct the reaction kinematics . in this output , there was no identification of which e / m shower belonged to the outgoing photon , electron , or positron . since the main purpose of the experiment was to measure the @xmath0 decay rate as a function of the invariant mass @xmath71 , the next step of the analysis was to separate the final - state photon from the electron and positron .",
    "this procedure was optimized by using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the process @xmath59 .    to reproduce the experimental yield of the @xmath0 decays depending on the incident - photon energy ,",
    "the @xmath1 reaction was generated according to its excitation function , measured in the same experiment  @xcite , which was then folded with the bremsstrahlung energy dependence of the incident photons .",
    "since the energy range used in the analysis covers almost 700  mev of the photon beam energies , the production angular distribution of @xmath1 changes with energy . as this distribution averaged over all energies is sufficiently close to an isotropic distribution , for simplicity , the production angle was generated isotropically .",
    "the @xmath0 decay was generated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dgdm ] ) , assuming the @xmath3 transition form factor @xmath56 .",
    "possible background processes were studied via mc simulation .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 was simulated for several other decay modes of the @xmath3 meson to check if they could mimic a peak from the @xmath0 signal .",
    "such mc simulations were made for the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 decays .",
    "the energy dependence and the production angular distribution of all @xmath1 simulations were generated in the same way as for the process @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 decay , all other decays of @xmath3 were generated according to phase space .",
    "the major background under the peak from @xmath0 decays was found to be from the reaction @xmath76 .",
    "the mc simulation of this reaction was done in the same way as reported in ref .",
    "although this background is smooth in the region of the @xmath3 mass and can not mimic an @xmath0 peak , its mc simulation was used for optimizing the signal - to - background ratio and parametrizing the background under the signal .    for all reactions ,",
    "the simulated events were propagated through a geant ( version 3.21 ) simulation of the experimental setup . to reproduce resolutions of the experimental data , the geant output ( energy and timing ) was subject to additional smearing , thus allowing both the simulated and experimental data to be analyzed in the same way .",
    "the simulated events were also tested to check whether they passed the trigger requirements .",
    "the optimization of other selection cuts was based on the analysis of the @xmath0 candidates selected with the kinematic fit to the experimental data and mc simulations . as it turned out",
    ", the @xmath70 decays in the three - cluster sample ( i.e. , without the outgoing proton detected ) have a level of background under the peak from @xmath0 that is significantly larger than in the four - cluster sample .",
    "this background was partially suppressed by testing the kinematic - fit hypotheses @xmath77 and @xmath78 to the same events , then rejecting those for which the probability to be @xmath79 or @xmath1 was greater than @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the pid detector was used to separate both the final - state electron and positron ( the detection efficiency for @xmath82 in the pid is close to 100% ) from the outgoing photon .",
    "since , with respect to the target , the pid provides a full coverage only for the cb crystals , events with only three e / m showers in the cb were selected for further analysis . besides improving significantly the separation of electrons and positrons from photons with the pid , this criterion makes almost all selected events pass the trigger requirements ( the total energy and the multiplicity in the cb ) .",
    "the identification of electrons and positrons was based on a correlation between the @xmath17 angles of fired pid elements with the angles of e / m showers in the cb .",
    "the mc simulation of @xmath59 was used to optimize this procedure , minimizing a probability of misidentification of the photon with either the electron or the positron .",
    "such misidentification can occur , for example , if the @xmath17 angle of the photon is close to the angle of the electron or the positron .",
    "the efficiency of the identification procedure was tested by comparing the generated invariant mass @xmath71 with the reconstructed invariant mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeg_fig1](a ) , the difference between the generated and reconstructed @xmath71 values are shown for both three- ( dashed line ) and four - cluster ( solid line ) events . as seen , the @xmath71 invariant - mass resolution , determined by the kinematic - fit technique , is slightly better for the four - cluster events , @xmath83  mev/@xmath84 , compared to @xmath85  mev/@xmath84 for the three - cluster events .",
    "this is caused by using the outgoing - proton information in the kinematic fit .",
    "misidentification of the outgoing photon with either the electron or the positron is very small .",
    "as found from the mc simulation of @xmath59 , this misidentification typically occurs for high @xmath86 masses ( @xmath87  gev@xmath88 ) , which correspond to highly populated low @xmath71 masses .",
    "however , the analysis of the experimental data showed that this misidentification is not crucial for measuring the @xmath89 signal , as it can not be determined at @xmath90  gev@xmath88 because of a too low signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the analysis of the mc simulations for all background reactions revealed that only the process @xmath91 could mimic the @xmath0 peak .",
    "this can occur mostly when one of the final - state photons converts into an electron - positron pair in the material between the production vertex and the nai(tl ) surface , or when the photon shower inside the cb splits into two energetic subshowers , reconstructed then as two separate clusters ( so - called cluster split - offs ) .",
    "this background was partially suppressed by optimizing the cluster algorithm and by requiring the number of the fired pid elements to be greater than one .",
    "the loss of good @xmath0 events because of the pid cut is small , as it corresponds to a case when the electron and positron have very close @xmath17 angles .",
    "besides the so - called physical background , there are two more background sources .",
    "the first one comes from interactions of incident photons in the windows of the target cell .",
    "the subtraction of this background from experimental spectra was based on an analysis of data samples that were taken with an empty ( no liquid hydrogen ) target .",
    "another background is due to random coincidences of the tagger hits with the experimental trigger ; its subtraction was done by using only those tagger hits for which all coincidences were random ( see refs .",

    "@xcite . including the three - cluster events in the analysis gains an additional 20% in the acceptance .",
    "the acceptance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eeg_fig1](b ) is calculated as a ratio of the reconstructed events that passed all selection criteria to the all events generated for @xmath59 . since the @xmath0 decay was generated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dgdm ] ) , the number of generated events with large @xmath71 masses is much smaller than those with low @xmath71 .",
    "the increase seen in the @xmath71 acceptance above 0.4  gev/@xmath84 is artificial ; it occurs owing to a self - background from the events that have large @xmath86 masses and the outgoing photon is misidentified with the electron or the positron .",
    "as for the generated @xmath0 decays , large @xmath86 masses correspond to the highly populated region of low @xmath71 masses , the amount of the self - background events reconstructed with large @xmath71 masses is comparable with the number of the actual events at this @xmath71 range .",
    "those self - background events are typically spread wider in the @xmath92 distribution and can be partially eliminated by reevaluating the acceptance with a gaussian fit to the peak from @xmath0 decays ( how it was done in the fitting procedure described later ) .",

    "because of the background under the @xmath0 signal , the uncertainties of the data points do not reflect the actual statistic for the @xmath0 decays observed , which was @xmath112 and @xmath57 for only four - cluster and all events , respectively .",
    "some staggering of the data points is also caused by statistical fluctuations of background events under the @xmath0 peak .    since the data based only on the four - cluster events have a better signal - to - background ratio , resulting in smaller fit uncertainties , and a wider covering of the @xmath71 range , they are considered as the main results of this work .",

    "the correlation between the two parameters results in a larger fit error for @xmath2 .",

    "the results based on the sum of the three- and four - cluster events were used to estimate the systematic uncertainty that comes from fitting the background under the @xmath0 peak ( as the two subsets have different levels of background ) and from the acceptance correction , including the detection efficiency for the outgoing proton .",
    "this systematic uncertainty was estimated by replacing the main @xmath110 results below @xmath100  mev/@xmath84 with the results obtained from the sum of the three- and four - cluster events and repeating the fit with the @xmath3 tff parametrized as eq .",

    "[ fig : eta_tff_exp_thr ] , the results of this work for @xmath111 are also compared to three different theoretical predictions . since all models assume that @xmath120 , for a better comparison , the fit to the data points from fig .",

    "the second calculation is based on a model - independent method using pad approximants that was developed for the @xmath9 tff in ref .",
    "using spacelike data ( cello  @xcite , cleo  @xcite , babar  @xcite ) , this method provides a parametrization that is also suited to describe data in the @xmath121 range from zero to @xmath122  gev/@xmath84 , and thus provides a model - independent prediction for the timelike tff  @xcite . over the full @xmath121 range , this calculation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_tff_exp_thr](a ) by a red dashed line with an error band ) practically overlaps with the pole - approximation fit to the present data points .    in another recent calculation",
    "@xcite by the jlich group , the connection between the radiative decay @xmath123 and the isovector contributions of the @xmath124 tff is exploited in a model - independent way , using dispersion theory ( dt ) .",
    "this calculation ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_tff_exp_thr](b ) by a dotted line with an error band ) goes slightly above the fit to the present data .",
    "currently , the vmd models that are used to calculate the contribution of the hadronic light - by - light scattering to @xmath19 include only @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17 resonances .",
    "these contributions are calculated with @xmath125  mev close to the @xmath16-meson mass .",
    "this value of @xmath42 was determined from a fit to spacelike data measured by the cleo collaboration  @xcite down to the momentum transfer @xmath126  gev@xmath21 , which is far away from @xmath22  gev@xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath42 value from cleo disagrees with the vmd value , @xmath127  mev .",
    "it also disagrees with the result of this work , @xmath128  mev , by more than one standard deviation , where both the measurements are of a similar accuracy .",
    "however , the measurement presented in this work was performed much closer to @xmath22  gev@xmath21 , and it agrees very well with earlier measurements of the @xmath129 dalitz decay , just improving their accuracy . though the results of this work are not able to rule out the vmd models used for calculating @xmath19 , one can see that smaller values for @xmath42 should be used in those calculations , indicating that contributions from heavier vector - meson resonances , like , e.g. , @xmath130 , might not be completely negligible .",
    "a new determination of the electromagnetic transition form factor from the @xmath131 dalitz decay was presented in this paper .",
    "the statistical accuracy achieved in this work surpasses all previous measurements of @xmath131 and matches the na60 result based on @xmath132 decays from peripheral in - in collisions . compared to the former determination of the @xmath3 tff by the a2 collaboration ,",
    "an increase by more than one order of magnitude in statistic has been achieved .",
    "this was accomplished by an analysis of three times more data and the use of a kinematic - fit technique , which allowed for far looser cuts and for exploiting the full @xmath3 production range available at mami - c .",
    "the extracted slope parameter @xmath133  gev@xmath5 agrees within the uncertainties with the results from all recent measurements of the @xmath3 tff .",
    "a pole - approximation fit to the presented data shows almost perfect agreement with the model - independent calculation from ref .",
    "the calculation by terschlsen and leupold  @xcite and the dt calculation  @xcite deviate slightly from the fit , but the statistical uncertainties are still not sufficient to rule out any of the theoretical predictions .",
    "thus , a need for more precise measurements is evident , though the results of this work indicate clearly that smaller effective vector - meson masses @xmath42 should be used in vmd - like models for calculating the contribution of the hadronic light - by - light scattering to @xmath19 , as well as rare @xmath3 decays and all processes involving the @xmath3 tff .",
