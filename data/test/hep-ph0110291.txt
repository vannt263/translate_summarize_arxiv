    "the study of structure functions of hadrons in the bjorken limit and high enough @xmath5 , as probed in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , is traditionally considered the domain of perturbative qcd since the running coupling constant @xmath6 , becomes small @xcite .",
    "present day qcd leading order ( lo ) and next to leading order ( nlo ) phenomenological calculations can relate leading twist contributions to structure functions among different momentum scales through the well known linear integro - differential gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( glap ) equations @xcite .",
    "this makes sense if @xmath5 is high enough so that only leading twist logarithmic corrections contribute and higher twist power - like corrections are negligible . to start with",
    ", some theoretical or experimental nonperturbative profile function is needed as initial condition for the glap equations . in the nucleon case , qcd scaling violations have been confirmed by relating experimental partonic distributions at many @xmath7 values , and many phenomenological parametrizations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "naturally , these parametrizations are under continuous update to incorporate increasing information obtained from current experiments .",
    "the net result is that uncertainties in the parton distribution functions of the nucleon include not only a large body of experimental data , but also theoretical nnlo or higher twist error estimates which provide a , perhaps inaccurate , but undoubtedly systematic description within a large region in the @xmath8 plane ( see , e.g. , the talks in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast with the nucleon case , our present knowledge of parton distribution functions for other hadrons is rather poor .",
    "as suggested long ago @xcite , it is possible to estimate distribution functions using constituent quark models to evaluate the low energy initial condition under the assumption that the gluon and sea content of hadrons vanish at the corresponding low energy resolution scale , and dynamically generate them by qcd evolution to higher @xmath5 scales .",
    "these estimates can then be used to test the sensitivity of various experiments to the distributions of interest .",
    "recently , this approach has also been applied to generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) @xcite , which are generalizations of the usual parton distributions considered in this work and are related via a sum rule to the elastic form factors . unlike the usual parton distributions , the gpd s are not directly measurable as observables are always expressed in terms of them via a convolution formula .",
    "this has lead some @xcite to conclude that , at present , model calculations of the gpd s at a low scale are needed to assess the sensitivity of various observables to the gpd s . in practice , this requires an evolution of the gpd s calculated at the low energy scale to the scale relevant to the experiment .",
    "as @xmath9 is rather large at the low energy scale , one must worry about the use of perturbative evolution to connect the low energy model with the high energy data .",
    "thus , it seems prudent to test this procedure in a situation where data are available to compare with theory , i.e. , the usual parton distributions . to test the validity of this approach ,",
    "it is necessary to compare the lo and nlo results not only for the valence distributions , but also for the sea and gluon distributions .    from a theoretical viewpoint , pseudoscalar mesons and specifically @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons",
    "are particularly distinguished hadrons since most of their low energy properties follow the patterns dictated by chiral symmetry",
    ". actually , we do not expect to understand the properties of any hadron better than the pion , as chiral perturbation theory suggests . by extension",
    ", one might think that the parton structure of a pion is the simplest one to consider provided chiral symmetry constraints , i.e. , spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking , are properly incorporated .",
    "the recent work @xcite clarifies this point regarding explicit chiral symmetry breaking ; chpt allows one to systematically compute chiral corrections to the moments of structure functions , but says nothing about the soft pion limit .",
    "each moment corresponds to a undetermined low energy parameter which renormalizes a local operator . on the other hand ,",
    "improved qcd sum rules have also been employed @xcite to determine the quark distribution functions of the pion in the intermediate @xmath10 region , @xmath11 at @xmath12 where the model is applicable .",
    "the absolute normalization becomes a problem since some ansatz for the distributions must be made outside this @xmath13range .    among the quark models where spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry plays a dominant role , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model provides a particular example of a chiral quark model where a unified picture of vacuum , mesons and nucleons",
    "is achieved @xcite .",
    "pseudoscalar mesons appear as quark - antiquark excitations of the spontaneously broken vacuum .",
    "several calculations of the pion structure functions within chiral quark loop models have been made and many different results for the initial conditions have been obtained .",
    "one important and tricky reason for the discrepancies lies in the use of different regularization procedures .",
    "as the bosonized version of the njl model is similar to other quark - loop models of the pion ( the @xmath14 coupling is @xmath15-like ) , we think it of interest to briefly review them and comment on the main differences . the use of different regularizations might be regarded as an objection to the njl model itself .",
    "however , not every regularization scheme can be considered acceptable . actually , some of the quark - loop calculations violate some necessary conditions on the regularization .",
    "we argue in the following that in some cases one should blame the regularization scheme instead of the model . at a formal level",
    ", the process of going from the hadronic to the distribution function can be done by using the so - called quark - target scattering formula @xcite .",
    "a large body of quark loop model calculations have been done making use of these ideas @xcite .",
    "the problem of proceeding in that way is that the distribution function may turn out to be non - normalizable .",
    "unfortunately , no first principle calculations of structure functions for pseudoscalar mesons are yet available with the exception of some standard lattice calculations of the lowest moments @xcite , albeit in the quenched approximation and subjected to well - known problems with chiral extrapolations . in addition , the reconstruction of the @xmath10 dependent structure function via some inverse moments method is strongly biased in the intermediate and low @xmath10 regions .",
    "the transverse lattice approach employed in refs .",
    "@xcite offers the possibility of directly computing structure functions in @xmath10-space . in any case , as one might expect from the quenched approximation , the lattice results provide a larger momentum fraction of valence quarks than those suggested by phenomenological analyses  @xcite .",
    "although not as well determined as the nucleon , the parton structure of the pion has been analyzed on a phenomenological level @xcite and a simple parametrization at @xmath16 has been given .",
    "the valence quark distributions extracted in this work @xcite from drell - yan experiments @xcite seem well determined , whereas the gluon distribution as obtained from the analysis of prompt - photon emission data @xcite is less well determined . on a phenomenological level , the constituent model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the valence distributions of the pion has been further extended to the sea and gluon distributions @xcite and the @xmath17 valence up - quark ratio . in these calculations and in the recent update @xcite the required total valence momentum fraction in the pion at @xmath18",
    "is taken to be the same as for the nucleon , @xmath19 , a bit below the value @xmath20 of ref .",
    "@xcite . as different data sets have been fitted and different nucleon parton distributions have been used in the different analyses , it is not clear what to make of the differences . in addition , although ref .",
    "@xcite includes error estimates , the model analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite does not include them , and therefore it is not possible to know if the differences are significant .",
    "let us note that the e615 experiment  @xcite suggests the valence density of the pion may be enhanced by about @xmath21 compared to the proton , and a recent analysis @xcite of the zeus di - jet data seem to favor the gluon distributions of ref .",
    "thus , in determining the low - energy scale of our model , we use the valence momentum fraction found in ref .",
    "finally , we also compare with the @xmath22 structure function ratio at @xmath23 , which has been measured using the drell - yan process @xcite .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , we found the structure function of the pion to be a constant function of @xmath10 in the njl model in the chiral limit and in the leading order of a large @xmath24 expansion . to get this result",
    "the use of a suitable regularization method was needed .",
    "a thorough study of regularization methods in the njl model may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer to that work for a more detailed description . by suitable",
    "we mean several desirable properties that should be incorporated , namely :    * the connection between the forward compton amplitude and the quark - target scattering amplitude is valid only for gauge invariant , finite amplitudes .",
    "for this reason , some gauge invariant regularization must be imposed on the compton amplitude .",
    "naive sharp cut - offs are not acceptable from this viewpoint . in addition",
    ", this way of proceeding represents a further advantage , since in the njl model it is only known how to regularize closed quark loops .",
    "the quark target scattering amplitude corresponds to an open quark line .",
    "* the regularization must produce exact scaling in the bjorken limit .",
    "the main reason is that this is the only way we know how to extract the leading , and eventually higher , twist contributions for which qcd evolution is known .",
    "this eliminates proper - time regularization , since it produces unrealistic scaling violations .",
    "* the regularization must also be able to work away from the chiral limit , but without spoiling the qcd anomaly .",
    "the former condition precludes a single pauli - villars subtraction .",
    "* the regularization should allow calculations in both minkowski and euclidean space , i.e. , dispersion relations must be fulfilled .",
    "this turns out to be very convenient for dis calculations , since cutting rules may be used .",
    "* the resulting distributions should satisfy the normalization condition and the momentum sum rule .",
    "we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pauli - villars with two subtractions fulfills the desired requirements .",
    "in addition , the pauli - villars scheme does not spoil the good description of other low energy hadronic properties found in the njl model @xcite , fulfills dispersion relations @xcite , and allows one to regularize the dirac sea of the chiral soliton away from the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath25 for definiteness , one gets in the chiral limit @xmath26 the results for @xmath27 are displayed for completeness in the appendix . by construction , eq.([result ] ) is consistent with chiral symmetry .",
    "the result was obtained by several means within the njl model either using pauli - villars regularization @xcite on the virtual compton amplitude or imposing a transverse cut - off @xcite upon the quark - target amplitude .",
    "this result has been recently re - derived @xcite in a chiral quark model solving chiral ward identities by using the so - called gauge technique @xcite . the easiest way to understand eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is perhaps in terms of phase space arguments and point couplings ( i.e. , constant matrix elements ) @xcite . for a massless pion",
    "this is justified since intermediate states in the quark - target amplitude have @xmath28 and the low momentum components of @xmath29 matrix element dominate .",
    "let us mention that eq.([result ] ) disagrees with other njl calculations , due to the use of different regularizations . if the virtual compton amplitude is used with a four - dimensional cut - off @xcite or the quark - target amplitude is used with lepage - brodsky regularization @xcite , different shapes for the quark distributions are obtained . the null - plane @xcite njl model with sharp cut - off @xcite , light - cone ( lc )",
    "quantized njl model @xcite and spectator model @xcite calculations also produce different results . in all cases ,",
    "the use of momentum dependent form factors or non - gauge invariant regularizations make the connection between compton amplitude and quark - target amplitude doubtful and , furthermore , spoil normalization .",
    "the results based on a quark loop with momentum dependent quark masses @xcite seem to produce a non - constant distribution .",
    "recent calculations on the transverse lattice reveal @xcite either an almost flat structure very much resembling eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) at a scale @xmath30 or a more bumped form @xcite .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between these two transverse - lattice calculations is not obvious to us .    in this paper",
    "we study within lo and nlo the parton content of pseudoscalar mesons , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 including valence , gluon and sea distributions , thus extending our previous work @xcite where only the initial conditions were presented and the lo evolution for the valence distributions .",
    "there , we analyzed the lo valence contribution and impressive agreement with smrs @xcite parametrization at @xmath18 was obtained .",
    "encouraged by this success we extend our analysis to the sea and gluon distributions both in lo and nlo evolution .",
    "to perform the evolution , one must determine the scale @xmath31 of the model .",
    "we determine this scale by fitting the valence quark momentum fraction at 4 gev@xmath32 .",
    "for definiteness , we take the running strong coupling constant at the @xmath33 mass , @xmath34 , to be @xmath35 and evolve it down by exactly solving the differential equation @xmath36   \\label{eq : beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "has @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "this yields the value @xmath45 . below that scale",
    "we fix the number of flavors equal to three , since we consider evolution below charm threshold . the previous formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) , is used to transform the variable @xmath46 into the variable @xmath9 , by exactly . ] solving the differential equation .",
    "since we numerically perform the nlo evolution of the sea and gluon distributions , it is convenient to specify the initial @xmath47 at @xmath48 and numerically integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) to @xmath49 to obtain @xmath50 .",
    "we note , however , that it is also possible to find an implicit solution for @xmath50 in terms of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath51 although we are not aware of an analytic solution for @xmath50 in terms of the other parameters , this equation may be solved numerically very quickly and accurately using newton s method .",
    "for example , taking @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and using this @xmath47 as the initial seed for @xmath50 , one obtains at least eight - significant digit accuracy for @xmath50 after at most ten iterations all the way down to @xmath54 of 0.4 gev .",
    "this form also enables one to determine at what scale @xmath50 diverges . for @xmath55",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 evidently , @xmath50 diverges when the right - hand - side of the above equation vanishes , which happens at a scale of @xmath57 0.365 gev .",
    "the non - singlet momentum fraction satisfies the differential equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be any non - singlet quark distribution .",
    "up to two loops one obtains the expansion @xcite @xmath60 to proceed further , we use the results from ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that at @xmath18 valence quarks carry @xmath61 of the total momentum fraction in the pion , e.g. , for @xmath25 , @xmath62 evolving downwards , we get that for @xmath63 valence quarks carry @xmath64 of the total momentum in the pion in lo ( nlo ) .      having determined @xmath31 of our model , we evolve the structure functions to @xmath65 gev@xmath32 using the scheme presented in ref .",

    "( [ fig : kaon ] ) . a practical parametrization of the corresponding initial condition may be found in the appendix .",
    "similar to the pion case , there are only small differences between lo and nlo evolution .",

    "<S> surprisingly , the nlo order effects turn out to be small compared to the lo ones . </S>",
    "<S> the valence distributions are in good agreement with experimental analyses , but the gluon and sea distributions come out to be softer in the high - x region and harder in the low - x region than the experimental analyses suggest . </S>",
