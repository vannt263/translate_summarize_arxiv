    "the field of optical control and manipulation of molecular rotation has seen major advances over the years , and today various techniques allow to control the rotation alignment alignment1,alignment2 , orientation @xcite and directionality @xcite of molecular ensembles .",
    "one of the most innovative tools in this field is the _ optical centrifuge _ ( oc ) , originally proposed and implemented by corkum and collaborators @xcite , who introduced the possibility of controlled excitation of the molecular rotational degree of freedom by chirped laser pulses .",
    "the controlled nature of this process is twofold : the molecules reach very high rotational states ( _ super rotors _ ) , but they also remain closely centered around a specific target energy / frequency . the controlled rotation could be used to selectively dissociate molecules @xcite or a specific molecular bond @xcite and has been shown to change molecular characteristics , such as the molecule s stability against collisions @xcite and its scattering from surfaces averbukh1 .",
    "furthermore , a gas of super rotors may exhibit new optical properties @xcite and formation of vortices @xcite .    over the last few years , several state of the art experiments",
    "have been performed @xcite utilizing different molecules , and exploring the dynamics during and after the oc laser pulse , including the excitation process @xcite , the gyroscopic stage in which the molecules remain oriented @xcite and the equilibration and thermalization that follows the pulse and produces an audible sound wave @xcite . however , while the experimental setups improved considerably , the process of capture of molecules into the chirped resonant rotation is still poorly understood .",
    "this process was only studied numerically @xcite or under the constraint that the molecules rotate in a plane perpendicular to the laser propagation axis corkum1,ivanov2,girard .",
    "the former asumption makes it impossible to study the response of a randomly oriented molecular ensemble to the oc pulse . as a result ,",
    "the efficiency of the oc , i.e. the fraction of molecules captured by the chirped laser drive , was not analyzed sufficiently .    in this work , we will show that under the rigid - rotor approximation the oc is an example within a broad family of driven non - linear systems exhibiting a sustained phase - locking or _ autoresonance _",
    "( ar ) with a chirped drive .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed and studied in many applications , including atomic systems @xcite , plasmas @xcite , fluids ar5 , and semiconductor quantum wells @xcite . by using methods in the theory of ar and analyzing the associated phase space dynamics",
    "we will for the first time calculate the efficiency of the oc process .",
    "the quantum counterpart of the ar is the quantum energy ladder climbing ar6a , ar7,ar8 , but we will show that the classical ar analysis is relevant to many current experimental setups",
    ".    the scope of the paper will be as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we will discuss the driven - chirped molecular rotation in three dimensions , transform to action - angle variables , and use the single resonance approximation to reduce the problem to one degree of freedom .",
    "section [ te ] will focus on calculating the efficiency of the resonant capture process in the system via analysing its dynamics in a continuous phase space instead of a single particle approach . in section [ resdis ]",
    ", we will compare the theory with numerical simulations and discuss the validity of our approximations and the applicability to current experimental setups .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the fundamental idea of the oc , is that an anisotropic molecule will `` chase '' ( and , thus , be rotationally excited ) a rotating linearly polarized wave , whose polarization rotation accelerates over time . in practice ,",
    "such driving wave is created by combining two counter rotating and antichirped circularly polarized laser beams @xcite . for a wave propagating along the @xmath1 axis , with polarization angle @xmath2 in the @xmath3 plane , after averaging over the optical frequency of the laser beams , the interaction potential energy of a molecule in spherical coordinates",
    "is given by @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 , @xmath6,@xmath7 are the polarizability components of the molecule and @xmath8 is the electric field amplitude of the combined beam .",
    "for simplicity , we will use a _ linearly chirped _ driving frequency @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the chirp rate , but any sufficiently slow chirp will lead to similar results . the initial rotation frequency is set by taking an appropriate intial time .",
    "our driven system can be characterized by three different time scales , i.e. the drive sweeping time @xmath11 , the characteristic thermal rotation time @xmath12 , and the driving time scale @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the temperature , @xmath15 the molecule s moment of inertia , and @xmath16 is the characteristic thermal angular momentum .",
    "these three time scales define two dimensionless parameters , @xmath17 which measures the drive s strength , and @xmath18 characterizing the nonlinearity of the problem .",
    "these parameters enter naturally in the dimensionless hamiltonian of our driven system in spherical coordinates @xmath19where we normalize the canonical momenta and later the total angular momentum @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 , and use the dimensionless time @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution equations based on this hamiltonian comprised one of the two sets used for monte carlo simulations in this work .",
    "figure [ fig - a ] shows the distributions ( histograms ) of the normalized angular momenta at the end of the chirped oc drive after starting from initially thermal molecular ensemble .",
    "the resonant normalized angular momentum in the oc equals the instantaneous driving frequency normalized with respect to @xmath23 ( see below ) .",
    "the initial and final normalized driving frequencies in fig . [ fig - a ] were @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and we used parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "1a ) , @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "when parameter @xmath30 is increased ( for constant @xmath31 this corresponds to increasing the laser intensity ) , more molecules experience significant acceleration .",
    "nevertheless , if one seeks a narrow distribution around a specific target frequency , the acceleration in panels ( b ) and ( c ) fig .",
    "[ fig - a ] does not provide the desired level of control , showing a broad distribution around the target .",
    "in contrast , panel ( a ) , is a representative example for the degree of control and accuracy one can achieve with the oc , provided the parameters are chosen appropriatly . in this work",
    "we calculate the excitation efficiency and the width of the final distribution of the angular momentum in the @xmath0 parameter space .      like in many other physical systems",
    ", it is convenient to transform our driven problem to the action - angle variables of the unperturbed problem since the latter is integrable .",
    "this canonical transformation @xmath32 ( see appendix a for details ) leads to non trivial angle variables ( related to euler angles ) , while the actions @xmath20 and @xmath33 are the normalized total angular momentum and its projection on the @xmath34 axis . the transformed hamiltonian assumes the form : @xmath35where @xmath36 is a periodic function of @xmath37 of period @xmath38 , and its exact form is presented in the appendix .",
    "the perturbing part in ( [ h - aa ] ) contains several oscillating terms , however , the main resonance in our case is defined by requiring stationarity @xmath39 of the phase - mismatch @xmath40 . assuming a weak drive , i.e. @xmath41 ( this approximation will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv ) in the vicinity of the resonance , we can use the single resonance approximation @xcite , i.e. discard all the rapidly oscillating terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting approximate , single resonance hamiltonian is ( see appendix a ) : @xmath42where @xmath43the corresponding evolution equations are @xmath44here , the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath45 . equations ( [ b ] ) , ( [ c ] ) yield the integral of motion @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , which allows reduction to a single degree of freedom : @xmath48equation ( [ a ] ) still needs to be solved to obtain the precession of the angular momentum around the @xmath1-axis , but for calculating @xmath49 the one degree of freedom set above is sufficient .",
    "this is our second ( approximate ) set used in the simulations below , which , due to the adiabaticity and reduced number of degrees of freedom , is considerably faster numerically than the full set of evolution equations in terms of the original spherical coordinates .",
    "we will assume , and verify a posteriori that if @xmath50 is the range of @xmath20 values in a persistent resonance with the drive in our problem , then @xmath51 . under this assumption , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ sr4a ] ) can be neglected , and the phase locking ( resonance ) condition @xmath52 yields @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54be the value of @xmath20 satisfying the resonance condition exactly and define the deviation @xmath55 from the exact resonance .",
    "the evolution equations then yield @xmath56by taking the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ sr6a ] ) with respect to time and inserting eq .",
    "( [ sr6 ] ) , we get @xmath57where we shifted @xmath58 by @xmath59 and , to lowest order in @xmath60 , @xmath61 is evaluated at @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ sr7 ] ) describes a pseudo - pendulum under the action of a constant torque .",
    "the hamiltonian in this problem , with @xmath63 acting as the momentum , is : @xmath64where @xmath65this tilted cosine effective potential and the associated phase space portrait of dynamics of the pseudo - pendulum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - j ] for @xmath66 .",
    "the phase space ( bottom panel in the figure ) is comprised of open and closed trajectories , provided @xmath67 .",
    "the open trajectories exhibit a continuous growth of the phase - mismatch , i.e. are not phase locked with the drive , while for the closed trajectories the phase - mismatch is bounded .",
    "the closed trajectories are surounded by the separatrix having area shown in red in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "as @xmath68 in our problem is slowly varying ( increasing ) in time , both the closed and open trajectories evolve adiabatically in time , unless near the separatrix .",
    "this means that deeply trapped trjectories remain trapped , i.e the rotation frequency follows the drive , @xmath69 , constituting the ar in the system .",
    "the main problem remains the fate of the trajectories near the separatrix .",
    "these trajectories , in principle , can change their trapping status as the result of nonadiabatic dynamics and , thus ,  affect the oc efficiency .",
    "it should be mentioned that many other ar systems @xcite are described by the resonant hamiltonian similar to ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the process of capture into resonance in all these problems depends critically on the specific form of function @xmath70 . in many such problems @xmath71 , where @xmath15 is the relevant action variable in the problem . in all such cases , the capture into resonance from equilibrium and transition to ar",
    "is guaranteed provided the driving amplitude exceeds a sharp threshold @xcite .",
    "because of a different dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath20 no such threshold is characteristic of the driven molecule case .",
    "the study of this different capture mechanism comprises the main goal of the present investigation .",
    "we have seen in simulations in sec .",
    "[ model ] that for a range of parameters , the oc yields controlled rotational excitation of molecular ensembles . here",
    "we study the efficiency of such excitation process , i.e. evaluate the fraction of molecules from some initial distribution , which are captured into and remain in resonance . intuitively , one can assume that if the value of @xmath70 changes adiabatically , molecules will be either trapped or not according to their initial location in phase space - inside or outside the separatrix . while the changes of @xmath70 are generally adiabatic ( as will be seen later ) , this intuition proves to be wrong .",
    "indeed , the molecules which are inside the separatrix initially remain in resonance at later times , but additional molecules can cross the separatrix and enter the trapped region even if they were outside initially .",
    "an illustration of this process is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - b ] , where panel ( a ) shows the final phase - space distribution of a molecular ensemble having the same @xmath72 and @xmath73 initially and uniformly distributed values of @xmath58 ( see panel b ) .",
    "the normalized driving frequency was varied from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , and one can see that despite a much lower initial driving frequency compared to the rotation frequency of the molecules , a considerable amount of molecules end up captured into resonance and rotationally accelerated ( green ) .",
    "the location of the newly trapped molecules in the initial ensemble is shown in green in panel ( b ) .",
    "we find that this location and the fraction of trapped molecules strongly depends on the initial value of the driving frequency .",
    "this complexity is illustrated in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , showing in green the location of the molecules trapped in resonance with the drive for the same initial conditions , but with the initial driving frequency changed by @xmath76 .",
    "the fraction of the trapped molecules in cases ( c ) and ( d ) was @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively compared to @xmath79 in the case ( a - b ) .",
    "one approach to deal with the nonadiabatic passage through separatrix problem is to study an ensemble of initial conditions , checking whether the associated trajectories cross the separatrix .",
    "previous works used such approach with simpler systems , but the probabilistic nature of this nonadiabatic phenomenon led to rather complex results dioctorn , neishtadt . here , we will develop an alternative approach which examines the continuous phase space dynamics of the initial ensemble , instead of working with a collection of individual trajectories . this approach will yield the resonant capture probability , without ever specifying which initial conditions yield trajectories crossing the separatrix .",
    "we base our analysis on eq .",
    "( [ sr7 ] ) , where @xmath80 is evaluated at @xmath81 and , therefore , both @xmath70 and the associated separatrix area are monotonically increasing functions of time . for molecules close to the separatrix , trapped or untrapped , this approximation is satisfied because @xmath50 , where now we associate @xmath82 with the width of the separatrix in @xmath20 . for untrapped molecules",
    "far from the separatrix we can still evaluate @xmath70 at @xmath62 , because the phase mismatch @xmath58 for such molecules varies rapidely and the effect of the driving term in the quasipotential averages out .",
    "next , instead of passage through resonance with an ensemble of molecules having the same value of @xmath20 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - b ] , we consider an ensemble of molecules with initially uniform density in phase space between @xmath83 and @xmath84 with all molecules having the same @xmath85 .",
    "we show a numerical simulation in such a system as the driving frequency ( and therefore @xmath81 ) successively passes the resonance with all the molecules in the ensemble in fig .",
    "[ fig - c ] ( a video of this simulation can be found in the online supplementary material @xcite ) . as the driving frequency sweeps through the ensemble [ time progresses from ( a ) to ( c ) ] , the area of the associated separatrix ( in black ) increases and the added area is filled with the same density of molecules as in the original distribution .",
    "however , the area of the separatrix which was empty when the separatrix first entered the distribution , remains empty forming a phase space hole passing through the distribution ( similar phase space holes were studied in plasma physics applications @xcite ) .",
    "note that the separatrix crossing occurs near the saddle point ( where the adiabacity condition is not met ) and the molecules `` line up '' to enter the separatrix , as seen in panel ( b ) in the figure .",
    "following the crossing , the area filled by the newly trapped molecules is very regular , and the only irregular regions of phase space after passage through resonance are those near the boundaries @xmath86 of the original distribution .",
    "furthermore , one can observe that the whole distribution is shifted to lower values of @xmath20 after the drive completed its passage through the ensemble .",
    "the resonant phase space dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - c ] can be explained on the bases of ( a ) the adibaticity in the problem @xcite and ( b ) the incompressibility of the phase space @xcite .",
    "the adiabaticity guarantees the conservation of the area of the empty hole inside the growing separatrix , while the incompressibility of the phase space ensures that the distribution of the newly trapped molecules inside the separatrix would be the same uniform ( original ) distribution as long as @xmath81 is well within the range @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , as time progresses and the resonant separatrix passes an infinitesimal distance @xmath88 inside the distribution , the density @xmath89 of newly trapped molecules is @xmath90where @xmath91 is the initial ( uniform ) density of the molecules in phase space and @xmath92 is the change of the area of separatrix during the corresponding infinitesimal time interval .",
    "thus , the number of the newly trapped molecules after passage through the whole distribution is @xmath93 , @xmath94 being the full added area of the separatrix after the passage .",
    "these simple arguments also allow us to calculate the probability of capture into resonance for a general initial distribution of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , which will be discussed next .",
    "the generalization to the case of an arbitrary initial phase space density distribution @xmath97 independent of @xmath58 can proceed by viewing this distribution as a collection of uniform infinitesimally thin layers , each having some value of @xmath96 . as the most prevailing case",
    ", we focus on initially thermal distribution of molecules , where the distribution of @xmath20 is @xmath98and , therefore , @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the density of the molecules . for a given @xmath96",
    ", we view this distribution as a collection of uniform layers of thickness @xmath101 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - d ] .",
    "the resonant drive passes all these layers , so at any given time , we have a collection of identical separatrices around the resonant @xmath81 . since the layers have a uniform density , and @xmath102 , the passage of the separatrix through the layers can be treated as discussed above . as the separatrix advances an infinitesimal distance @xmath103 , the total density ( after summation over all the layers and integration over @xmath58 ) of newly trapped molecules for given @xmath96 will be [ see eq .",

    "note that counter - intuitively , when @xmath110 decreases and @xmath132 becomes small , the capture probability increases and reaches a maximum . in these cases ,",
    "the vast majority of captured molecules cross the separatrix during the evolution , and do nt start in resonance initially .",

    "the numerical results include the simulations in spherical coordinates ( blue diamonds ) , the single resonance simulations ( red circles ) , and both are compared with the analytical result ( solid line ) .",
    "one can see that the analytic prediction correctly describes the simulations only in a certain range of parameters .",
    "this is not surprising , as several approximations were made in the theory , and need to be discussed next .",
    "one such approximation is the relative smallness @xmath50 of the width of the separatrix in @xmath20 . in terms of parameters",
    "@xmath136 this condition yields inequality@xmath137which justifies the approximation in eq .",

    "[ fig - f ] by dashed lines and one can see that both types of simulations agree until one violates condition @xmath138 , but the theoretical curves deviate earlier , because condition ( [ small_dell ] ) is stricter .",
    "the ratio @xmath140 measures the relative strength of the drive , so eq . ( [ small_dell ] ) describes the weak drive limit .",
    "another assumption of the theory is the adiabaticity of autoresonant evolution , i.e. @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the characteristic frequency of autoresonant modulations ( oscillations of trajectories trapped inside the separatrix ) .",

    "in addition , the dynamics of trapped molecules must be classical .",
    "for this to be true , the characteristic area @xmath151 ( dimensional ) of the separatrix in phase space must exceed the planck s constant @xmath152 , so mixing of a few angular momentum states would be possible . then , the inequality @xmath153 can serve as a condition for classicality of trapped trajectories .",

    "note that the classical results presented in this work are in the range of typical oc experiments .",
    "note also that the conservation law @xmath157  in our theory is the classical counterpart of the oc quantum selection rule @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the magnetic quantum number @xcite .",
    "finally , in developing the theory , we have assumed that the characteristic parameters @xmath0 are constant . in typical experiments",
    "these parameters may vary in time .",
    "for example , the laser pulse amplitude may have slow temporal dependence , the chirp rate @xmath129 may vary in time , and the trapped molecules may experience slow centrifugal expansion at high rotation speeds . because of the adiabaticity , these effects can be taken into account within our theory by using instantaneous values of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the adiabaticity guarantees continued trapping in the system as long as @xmath160 ( see eq .",

    "based on three characteristic time scales in the problem , we have introduced two dimensionless parameters @xmath161 ( see eqs .

    "we have then studied the continuous phase space dynamics of the reduced one degree of freedom system and found the probability of filling of separatrix by newly trapped molecules .",
    "this calculation was based on the adiabaticity in the problem and the incompressibility of the phase - space , avoiding the complex issue of deciding the fate of individual trajectories . for a thermal ensemble ,",

    "it also seems important to generalize the theory into the quantum regime and study the transition from the quantum ladder climbing to the classical autoresonance @xcite in the problem of molecular rotations .",
    "finally , a similar phase space analysis can be applied in studying the problem of capture into autoresonance in other dynamical systems .        the transformation to action - angle variables discussed in sec .",
