    "the combination of the self - focusing nonlinearity with a periodic potential acting in the free direction ( perpendicular to the direction of the action of the double - well potential ) changes the character of the bifurcation from subcritical to supercritical , with the asymmetric branches emerging as stable ones and immediately going in the forward direction @xcite .",

    "<S> we introduce discrete systems in the form of straight ( infinite ) and ring - shaped chains , with two symmetrically placed nonlinear sites . </S>",
    "<S> the systems can be implemented in nonlinear optics ( as waveguiding arrays ) and bec ( by means of an optical lattice ) . a full set of exact analytical solutions for symmetric , asymmetric , and antisymmetric localized modes is found , and their stability is investigated in a numerical form . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry - breaking bifurcation ( sbb ) , through which the asymmetric modes emerge from the symmetric ones , is found to be of the subcritical type . </S>",
    "<S> it is transformed into a supercritical bifurcation if the nonlinearity is localized in relatively broad domains around two central sites , and also in the ring of a small size , i.e. , in effectively nonlocal settings . </S>",
    "<S> the family of antisymmetric modes does not undergo bifurcations , and features both stable and unstable portions . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of unstable localized modes is investigated by means of direct simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , unstable asymmetric states , which exist in the case of the subcritical bifurcation , give rise to breathers oscillating between the nonlinear sites , thus restoring an effective dynamical symmetry between them . </S>"
