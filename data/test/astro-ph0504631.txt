    "flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite can be explained by the presence of a dark matter halo which extends much farther than the luminous disc . while at large distances the gravitational potential is completely dominated by the dark halo",
    ", there is still a vivacious debate about whether the dark matter is prevailing in the central parts of bright galaxies , and about whether its radial matter distribution is cuspy , or not  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , very little is known with certainty about the shape of the halo of disc galaxies and in many cases the halo is simply assumed to be spherical .    however ,",
    "if the disc is indeed an important component in the central parts , it should , due to its gravity , introduce some flattening of the dark matter distribution .",
    "furthermore , large scale cosmological @xmath0-body simulations have shown that , at least at large distances from the center , the natural shape of dark halos is triaxial ( see references in @xcite ) with density axial ratios in the range 0.5  0.8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether the flatness and the various complex structures and substructures of the luminous part of the galaxy will affect the dark matter halo , and to what extent the triaxiality of the halo will change a possible dark matter annihilation signal from the central parts of a galaxy .",
    "usually , two types of asphericity are considered : flattening of the halo and departure from axisymmetry . the halo flattening is quantified by the value of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the major axis in the galactic plane and @xmath3 is the axis perpendicular to that plane .",
    "various observational methods have been used to probe the halo flattening in our own galaxy and in neighboring ones  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that the measured flattening can vary over a wide range of values , depending on the galaxy and on the method used .",
    "a cross - check of the different methods with their systematic biases on the same galaxy would be welcome but is usually not possible .",
    "measurements based on atomic hydrogen favour oblate halos with shortest - to - longest ratios in the very wide range of 0.2 to 0.8 @xcite . for our own galaxy and based on the thickness of the milky way s gas layer ,  @xcite argue for a rather round halo with flattening @xmath4 , but their result depends heavily on the values of the galactocentric radius @xmath5 and of the galactic rotation speed @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the dynamics of the stellar stream coming from the disruption of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy also give a wide range of values , between 0.5 and 1.7  @xcite .",
    "the second type of asphericity is a departure from axisymmetry in the galactic plane .",
    "this is statistically quite common as a large fraction ( more than 70% ) of present day disc galaxies have bars or ovals  @xcite .",
    "also , it is now well agreed that our galaxy is barred in its central parts  @xcite .",
    "bars form naturally also in @xmath0-body simulations , as witnessed already in the early seventies  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was realized that the presence of a dark halo can play an active role in the formation of the disc bar , if it is non rigid , _ i.e. _ if it can interact with the disc .",
    "indeed , bars evolve and grow stronger by the redistribution of angular momentum within their galaxy .",
    "this is emitted by near - resonant material at the inner disc and absorbed by near - resonant material in the outer disc and in the halo  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the halo also is deformed and acquires a bar structure , which is fatter and shorter than the disc bar , but can concern a considerable amount of mass  @xcite .    on the observational side ,",
    "departures from axisymmetry can be checked from the orbits of the baryons , in particular the hi gas that has low velocity dispersion . obtaining a quantitative estimate of such asymmetries",
    "is , however , not trivial , since it implies a decoupling of the halo contribution from that of the luminous matter as well as a knowledge of the inclination of the galactic disc  @xcite .",
    "of course , a direct probe of the halo would enable to see whether the halo deformation follows the barred structure of the disk or not .",
    "if the recent egret diffuse gamma ray signal above 1 @xmath7 is interpreted as originating from dark matter , it indeed leads to such a structure with an ellipticity value @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study the impact of an elliptical deformation of the halo on the expected weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter annihilation signal from the galactic center .",
    "however , as discussed above , we do not know for certain what the dark matter radial profile is , so that distributions with or without a cusp , and with or without a spike have to be considered .",
    "the density enhancement in a cuspy profile follows the deepening of the central gravitational potential due to the baryon cooling through radiative processes @xcite .",
    "the presence of a super - massive black hole ( sbh ) at the galactic center can further create a spike , or an enhancement of the cusp , at very short distances from the galactic center @xcite but scatterings on stars and capture of dark matter particles by the sbh could decrease the density in this region @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the presence of a spike would boost the annihilation signal by several orders of magnitude . in the sequel",
    ", we will see how elliptical distortions interplay with density profiles in the dark matter annihilation signal .",
    "since the main observable annihilation signal from the galactic center is with @xmath9-rays @xcite , we will restrict ourselves to this case .",
    "the observed gamma - ray flux of energy @xmath10 , from the annihilation of dark matter particles @xmath11 ( with mass @xmath12 and density @xmath13 ) and annihilation cross section @xmath14 ( into final state @xmath15 ) , can be expressed as ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the differential gamma spectrum per annihilation coming from the decay of annihilation products of final state @xmath15 and the integral is taken along the line of sight .",
    "it is customary ( see  @xcite ) , in order to separate the factors depending on astrophysics from those depending only on particle physics , to introduce the quantity @xmath18 for the line of sight @xmath19 corresponding to the direction @xmath20 , @xmath21 we then define the astrophysical factor @xmath22 as the average of @xmath18 over a spherical region of solid angle @xmath23 , centered on the direction of the galactic center @xmath24 the solid angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the angular resolutions in the egret experiment and the hess and glast ones , respectively .",
    "the expected gamma - ray flux in an experiment with threshold energy @xmath27 is finally expressed as @xmath28 @xmath29    to compute the quantity @xmath30 , we assume the following effective parameterization for the dark matter halo @xmath31^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } }    { [ 1+(r / a)^{\\alpha}]^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } }    \\(\\frac{r_0}{r}\\)^{\\gamma } \\;\\ ;    \\(1+\\(\\frac{r_{sp}}{r}\\)^{\\gamma _ { sp}-\\gamma}\\ ) \\;\\ ; , \\label{eq : alphabetagamma}\\ ] ]    [ t ]    .parameters of some widely used non spiky density profiles models and corresponding value of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - phi ] , the variations of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath35 for @xmath36 (= 20 deg ; see review @xcite and references therein ) and @xmath37 , and as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath39 and 9 are given for the isothermal , kravtsov , nfw and moore halo profiles .",
    "for @xmath40 , @xmath30 increases with @xmath35 , which is expected since the higher density region is stretched along the line of sight in this case . for larger values of @xmath38 ,",
    "the variation becomes negative , as the stretching in the x axis is misaligned with the line of sight .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 for a fixed value of @xmath35 .",
    "it is important to notice that the impact of the ellipticity is stronger for less cuspy halo profiles ( which are favored by observations ) .",
    "indeed , the relative contribution to @xmath30 coming from inner regions inside a small radius @xmath41 increases with @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , for higher values of @xmath9 , a larger fraction of the volume integral @xmath42 is not affected by a change in ellipticity , as the observation solid angle is taken constant .    to study the influence of the prolate - oblate shape of the halo , we set @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ rell ] ) and let @xmath44 vary .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pro - ob ] , for the isothermal , kravtsov , nfw and moore halo profiles .",
    "the variation of @xmath30 with the prolate - oblate shape of the halo is again stronger for smaller values of @xmath9 . as we can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : pro - ob ] , an oblate deformation induces an enhancement of dark matter density along the line of sight increasing the signal , whereas the prolate shape decreases it and thus could be understood with arguments similar to those above .",
    "finally , let s consider the most popular dark matter candidate , _",
    "i.e. _ the neutralino ( @xmath11 ) , which comes from the neutral gauge and higgs boson superpartners in the _ minimal supersymmetric standard model _ ( mssm ) framework .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux - exp ] the neutralino dark matter resulting fluxes for a wide sample of supersymmetric models , _",
    "i.e _ we take parameters of the mssm to get bino as well as mixed bino - wino and bino - higgsino neutralino which have higher couplings and cross sections ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . all the points shown",
    "satisfy the wmap requirement on relic density and accelerator constraints . as the glast experiment sensitivity will probe a wide range of halo profiles",
    ", we clearly see that in addition to the ( essentially inner ) power law behavior of the halo , the geometry also alters the estimation of the fluxes and has to be included in flux calculations .",
    "the dark matter annihilation signal from the galactic center has been calculated for different halo characteristics .",
    "in particular , we have shown some possible effects of the halo asphericity .",
    "the induced corrections are more relevant for flat than for cuspy cores .",
    "although a plausible elliptical deformation of the dark matter halo does not change the expected annihilation signal by orders of magnitude , a consistent prediction of the flux from the halo shape or conversely of the halo shape from the signal should take those effects into account .",
