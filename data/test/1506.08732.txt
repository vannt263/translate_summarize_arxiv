    "since the first derivation of bell inequality based , except for  freedom \" , only on the assumption of locality and ( a form of ) realism ( or hidden causality , states , variables ) which one can find in the chsh paper @xcite , many other ones were derived .",
    "they either apply to different number of settings , or different number of systems and observers , or different observables ( for a recent review of this  zoo \" see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we would like to study the case of bell inequalities which are specially tailored for general quantum optical situations , especially the cases for fields of varying intensities ( essentially , undefined photon numbers ) .",
    "the case of strongly driven type - ii parametric down conversion ( with multiple pair emissions ) , which we shall call bright squeezed vacuum will be our working example here .",
    "but , obviously , multitude of other examples can be given .",
    "we use in the title the phrase  quantum optical fields \" to stress that the inequalities we study do not assume a fixed ( overall ) photon number .",
    "such inequalities play an important role in singling out non - classical phenomena in the optical domain .",
    "e.g. with the use of such inequalities bell s theorem for approximate epr states was finally given in @xcite .",
    "the idea was to use different observables than the ones discussed by epr . in @xcite",
    "observables with singular wigner representations were used ( essentially , photon number parity operators measured after a displacement ) . still , in general quantum optics",
    "there is an obvious demand for device - independent entanglement indicators ( witnesses ) and therefore bell inequalities for variables straightforwardly related to the usual measured observables .",
    "we shall propose such .",
    "but first we shall present the principal work which addressed the problem , and contains a kind of mainstream approach .",
    "we shall review here the derivation by reid and walls @xcite , which set the standard in the field , for many years .",
    "two observers measure intensities of light at outputs of some local interferometric devices .",
    "it is customary to think of them as outputs of polarization analyzers .",
    "we shall follow this picture here , as our aim is to convey to the reader the general ideas .",
    "let us concentrate on the derivation of clauser - horne - like @xcite inequalities , as they are often thought of as the most basic ones .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite would involve the following elements of the hidden variable description .",
    "we have intensities potentially measurable by alice in the two outputs of he analyzer @xmath0 , which are non - negative ( an extension of the approach of to this regime @xcite was given in @xcite ) and in principle unbounded .",
    "for bob we have @xmath1 . here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 symbolize the local settings of the polarization analyzers ( the can be replaced , if needed , by description characteristic for elliptic polarization measurements , like local bloch vectors , etc . ) , controllable by the observers , and @xmath4 stands for hidden variables ( hidden causes not present in the quantum description ) .",
    "the hidden variables are assumed to be distributed with a probability density @xmath5 . up to this point all that seems to be perfectly in line with the usual thinking behind bell inequalities    had the above been the only set of assumptions about local hidden variable description , one would not expect any loopholes in the resulting inequalities . however , next in ref .",
    "@xcite comes a remark that the  total intensity through each polarized is written `` @xmath6 it is argued that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in principle independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and that they correspond to local intensities with polarizers removed .",
    "all this is an _ additional _",
    "assumption on the form of hidden variable theories , which does not have to hold generally in all possible hidden variable descriptions .",
    "e.g. polarizer in such descriptions could ' ' enhance `` for some values of @xmath4 the total intensity registered behind it , and for some lower it .",
    "let us present an old argument .",
    "note that in classical optics if one has two polarization filters on the way of a beam , and the first one transmits the horizontal light only and the second one only the vertical one , then no light exits such two polarizer - system .",
    "however insertion , between the two , of a polarization filter selecting diagonally polarized light results in an output intensity which is @xmath9 of the original one .",
    "thus , the presence of polarizers does not always reduce intensity .",
    "one could here introduce a version of ' ' no enhancement \" assumption , namely @xmath10 etc . , but this also is an arbitrary constraint on hidden variable models .    the additional argumentation against such an assumption can come directly from quantum optics .",
    "take as an example ( bright ) squeezed vacuum .",
    "in such a state the intensity is undefined .",
    "however , one should not here that the condition perfectly holds for classical stochastic theory of light , and this could have been the intuition that led the authors of @xcite to adopt it .",
    "still , the condition does _ not _ hold in the case ",
    "stochastic electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "even if we argue that the condition reflects energy conservation , this can be challenged by the fact that the field _ plus the system of detectors _ is in fact an open system .",
    "thus the assumption seems not so much justified , afterall .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to formulate quantum optical bell theorem for systems of varying intensities which is free of such assumptions .",
    "the additional assumption ( [ assump1 ] ) allows one to construct local hidden variable correlation functions which are constrained by chsh - like @xcite inequalities .",
    "@xmath11    where @xmath12 while @xmath13 with all that one quickly arrives at the usual form of the chsh - like inequality : @xmath14 is the common denominator in all correlation functions entering the chsh - like inequality .",
    "thus assumption ( [ assump1 ] ) is crucial in the derivation .    in the case of clauser - horne - like inequalities",
    "one proceeds similarly .",
    "however , in the case of considerations in ref .",
    "@xcite the no - enhancement assumption is used instead of ( [ assump1 ] ) .",
    "namely that there exists variables , which are _ independent _ of the local setting ( and the remote one ... ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath15 this allows to introduce functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 are treated as intensities ( potentially ) measured by the local observers  without the polarizers present \" . the additional assumption ( [ assump2 ] )",
    "is not in conflict with ( [ assump1 ] ) , as it logically follows from it .",
    "still , it wides the class of hidden variable theories under consideration . nevertheless , is prone to the same criticism as ( [ assump1 ] ) .    to derive the actual inequality one can use the clauser - horne lemma : for real numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 one has @xmath20 ( in ref @xcite",
    "there is a typo in the equivalent inequality ) .",
    "thus @xmath21 this after averaging allows one to formulate a clauser - horne - like inequality @xmath22    the above inequalities .",
    "like most of other bell inequalities , e.g. the original chsh ones , can be used in the analysis of the formalism of quantum optics and its predictions aimed at proving the impossibility of having a local realistic model of all that .",
    "both types of inequalities can be violated in quantum optical experiments involving quantum entanglement . as a matter of fact , in very many quantum optical experiments",
    "the inequalities were used in analysis of results .",
    "still , the validity of such results ( theoretical and experimental ) is limited by the fact that we use the additional assumptions , already at the level of _ derivation _ of the inequalities .",
    "other loopholes ( detection loophole , locality loophole ) , which are due to experimental imperfections , can pop up in the analysis of the experimental results , however these are not a trait of the above inequalities .",
    "we shall show that one can derive bell inequalities for quantum optics of a different kind , but still being generalizations of the chsh ones and ch ones , which are free of the above additional assumptions and thus loophole free ( the loopholes can now appear only in the methods of execution of the actual experiments ) .",
    "we shall additionally argue that they are usually more strongly violated than the ones presented above .",
    "the inequalities will use  rates \" instead of intensities .",
    "we define them as @xmath23 and from the operational point of view they show the relative distribution of the measured intensities at the two outputs ( we still use the two output working examples , but all that can be generalized to more complicated cases ) of the local polarizer .",
    "we do not assume that the total intensity is independent of the local setting .",
    "instead we define the following variables @xmath24 of course in quantum theory averages both quantities do not depend on on the local settings of the polarizes ( well , in the experiment one could expect some variation due to imperfections affecting losses ) , but we introduce such a description having in mind the hidden variable theories for which  anything goes \" .    let us begin with a derivation of clauser - horne - like inequalities .      in this derivation",
    "we shall use a hidden variable model of the rates .",
    "our only basic tool will be @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in the hidden variable description we shall assume existence of values for all possible settings of the following variables : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 whenever the given denominator _ vanishes _",
    ", for certain @xmath4 and certain local setting , we additionally define that for the given ( hidden ) rate one has @xmath29 , where @xmath30 or @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively .    obviously one has @xmath33 .",
    "thus the clauser - horne lemma can be used to get @xmath34 this after averaging over @xmath5 leads to @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 this is the new form of a loophole free clauser - horne type inequality for quantum optical experiments .",
    "the loopholes are moved to the experimental imperfections , like inefficient detection , etc .",
    "the reader might be worried that we divide here by the intensity , and how should look like the quantum definition for equivalent expression .",
    "of course this depends on the model of detection used , which defines the intensity operators at the exists of the local devices ( polarizers ) . to illustrate this",
    "we shall use the simplest model : the photon number operator .    as we have four outputs , and an example involving polarizations ,",
    "let us introduce annihilation ( and creation ) operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( creation operators would have a dagger , @xmath42 ) . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for horizontal and vertical polarizations , and @xmath45 denote propagation beams , towards alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the operators for arbitrarily oriented ( linear ) polarization analyzers are : @xmath46 let us assume the the operators with @xmath47 denote @xmath48 exit of the local polarizers , and the other ones @xmath49 output . under the chosen intensity model given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath32 for @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the quantum versions of the functions in the inequality read : @xmath53,\\ ] ] and @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the quantum state , and @xmath56 are given by : @xmath57 the operators @xmath58 are projectors into the subspace , of the fock space , of the modes described by annihilation operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which does not contain vacuum .    in case",
    "the notation seems a bit too dense , let us write an example of such an operator explicitly .",
    "e.g. , the operator @xmath61 acts in the _ joint _ fock space of modes @xmath62 _ and _ @xmath63 , and reads @xmath64 with @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the identity operator in the space , and @xmath67 is the vacuum of the space satisfying @xmath68    as in quantum optics violations of bell inequalities of the type presented in @xcite usually decreases with the growing number of photons , see e.g. @xcite , the inequalities introduced here might be less prone to this effect , because their form warrants that that terms with higher photon numbers contribute less to correlation functions @xmath69 and to the local averages @xmath70 .",
    "thus we shall benefit from their use twice .",
    "they are not only formulated without additional assumptions ( which is a kind of built in loophole ) , but also we shall gain on the sensitivity of the inequalities in detecting non - classicality .",
    "this will be shown in the examples of the next section .",
    "but before this we shall derive chsh - like bell inequalities for quantum optics based on similar concepts .",
    "the chsh - like inequalities can be derived using the same basic hidden variable objects @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and their functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , plus additional ones @xmath73 where @xmath26 and @xmath74 recall the all @xmath75 variables equal zero for zero total local intensity .",
    "obviously this can be done by introducing correlation functions @xmath76 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times [ r_{b_+}(\\phi , \\lambda)-r_{b_-}(\\phi , \\lambda)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath77 , one can proceed in the usual way to derive : @xmath78 while this is a correct inequality , its usefulness for quantum optics is highly limited .",
    "this is because in most bell experiments the produced states are such that the vacuum components dominate .",
    "especially this is the case for parametric down conversion , see e.g. @xcite . as a result",
    "the values of the correlation functions are very low , and the left hand side can not breach the bound of 2 . still such inequalities could be of use in the case of event ready experiments , see @xcite .    to devise chsh inequalities which are immune to this deficiency , one can proceed as follows .",
    "one can introduce new rate functions which behave differently when the intensity is _",
    "zero_. simply one can redefine the ( arbitrary ) value of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for zero total intensity , and put is as @xmath79 .",
    "no change is required for @xmath80 .",
    "we can denote the redefined rate functions by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "again we have @xmath83 with the new variables the hidden variable model for the correlation function reads : @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times [ r_{b_+}'(\\phi , \\lambda)-r_{b_-}(\\phi , \\lambda)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this definition does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency , because in the case of vacuum the values @xmath79 pop up .",
    "we have a modified inequality : @xmath85 . to this end one must define the operator @xmath86 .",
    "this will be again done for the trivial model of intensity in terms of the number operator .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the vacuum for the @xmath90 modes .",
    "surprisingly the new inequalities , not only are free of an inbuilt loophole ( that is the additional condition ) , but one can easily find examples of quantum optical states with violate them more robustly than the old - type inequalities .",
    "we shall consider here our working example of the four mode ( bright ) squeezed vacuum .",
    "the state reads @xmath91 where @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath90 refer to the two directions along which the photon pairs are emitted , @xmath94 denote horizontal / vertical polarization , and @xmath95 represents an amplification gain .",
    "the state is rotationally invariant , i.e. , all probabilities are dependent only on @xmath96 , and this can also holds for elliptic polarizations ..    first , let us compute the value of the chsh expression in fashion of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to formula ( [ reidexp ] ) . for every fock component of state ( [ bsv ] ) with @xmath97 photons ,",
    "the correlation function is a cosine function with one of its minima at @xmath98 and amplitudes @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ reidexp ] ) , summed over @xmath100 with weights @xmath101 , reads @xmath102 while the denominator is equal to @xmath103 if we optimal settings @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we get violations of the bell inequality for @xmath106 .    in the new loophole - free approach utilizing the ratios , for an individual @xmath97-photon component we have @xmath107[r_{b_+}'(\\phi , \\lambda)-r_{b_-}(\\phi , \\lambda)]|\\psi_-{(n)}\\rangle & \\nonumber\\\\ & = -\\frac{n+2}{3n}\\cos(\\theta-\\phi ) , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath108[r_{b_+}'(\\phi , \\lambda)-r_{b_-}(\\phi , \\lambda)]|0,0,0,0 \\rangle=-1 $ ] . after averaging over fock components with weights @xmath109 ,",
    "we get @xmath110 . & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this put into the chsh expression provides violation for @xmath111 .",
    "not only does inequality ( [ chshc ] ) provide a fully valid bell inequality for quantum optical fields , it also extends a region of gain @xmath95 , for which they can be violated .      after some algebraic manipulations",
    "the coincidence rate function @xmath69 ( [ quantum ] ) for the bright squeezed vacuum state ( [ bsv ] ) can be found to be @xmath112 the visibility ( contrast ) of the interference is therefore @xmath113 where the minimum and maximum is taken over @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in the case of the appraoch of @xcite the visibility is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath114 the visibilities for rates are much more pronounced , see fig .",
