    "the new generation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments ( see e.g. @xcite , and the future missions planck @xcite , and map @xcite ) promises to estimate the cosmological parameters within a precision of 1% .",
    "the current dataset already allows in some cases an uncertainty below 10% on such parameters as the baryon density or the primordial spectral slope .",
    "such a precision allows and demands a clear assessment of the theoretical assumptions .",
    "so far , all the estimations of cosmological parameters based on the cmb data assumed a gaussian distribution of the primordial fluctuations ( the only exception i know of is ref .",
    "@xcite in which the primordial slope @xmath2 was estimated in presence of skewness ) .",
    "such an assumption is based on the conventional models of inflation and has the obvious and enormous advantage of being simple and uniquely determined .",
    "however , the gaussianity of the primordial temperature fluctuations is still to be fully tested @xcite and there exist several theoretical models which actually predict its violation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to quantify how the cosmological parameters derived from cmb experiments depend on the statistical properties of the fluctuation field .    in this paper",
    "i derive the dependence of four cosmological parameters on the skewness of the fluctuations assuming a flat space .",
    "the parameters are the primordial slope @xmath2 , the baryon and cold dark matter rescaled density parameters @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / sec / mpc ) , and the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the flat space constraint reduces to the relation @xmath6    it is clear that removing the hypothesis of gaussianity leaves room for an infinity of different possible assumptions concerning the fluctuation distribution .",
    "i adopt here the edgeworth expansion ( ee ) , for three reasons : a ) it can be seen as a perturbation of a gaussian function ; b ) it is easy to manipulate analytically and c ) it is the distribution followed by any random variable that is a linear combination of @xmath7 random variables in the limit of large @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 the edgeworth distribution reduces to a gaussian ) .",
    "the latter property might be useful to describe fluctuations that arise due to several independent sources .",
    "the ee has been previously used in cosmology to model small deviations from gaussianity @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the ee is that it is not positive definite .",
    "however , when the deviation from gaussianity is small , this problem is pushed many standard deviations away from the peak and does not affect the parameter estimation .",
    "this paper is meant to exemplify the effects that a non - zero skewness introduces on the likelihood estimation .",
    "for generality , i will not confine myself to any specific mechanism for generating the non - gaussianity .",
    "moreover , for simplicity , i will skip over several additional complications like bin cross - correlations , calibration , pointing and beam errors that an accurate analysis should take into account .",
    "the likelihood function usually adopted in cmb studies ( e.g. @xcite ) is an offset log - normal function .",
    "this function is an approximation to the exact likelihood that holds for gaussian data in presence of gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "the offset depends on quantities that are not yet publicly available ; since the offset can be neglected in the limit of small noise , we assume as starting point a simple log - normal that , neglecting factors independent of the variables , can be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the theoretical quantity and to the real data , @xmath13 are the spectra binned over some interval of multipoles centered on @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the experimental errors on @xmath16 , and the parameters are denoted collectively as @xmath17 .",
    "we neglect also the residual correlation between multipole bins , which should be anyway very small for the latest data .",
    "an overall amplitude parameter @xmath18 can be integrated out analytically adopting a logarithmic measure @xmath19 in the likelihood .",
    "writing @xmath20 it follows @xmath21 so that , neglecting the factors independent of the variables and putting @xmath22 , we obtain@xmath23 ^{2}}{2\\sigma _ { \\ell } ^{2}}\\right ] dw\\propto e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\gamma -\\frac{\\beta ^{2}}{\\alpha } \\right ) } , \\ ] ] where    @xmath24    let us now introduce the edgeworth expansion . denoting with @xmath25 the normal variable in the gaussian function ,",
    "the edgeworth expansion is @xcite@xmath26 \\left [ \\right .",
    "1+\\frac{k_{3,\\ell } } { 6}h_{3}(x_{\\ell } ) + &   & \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{k_{4,\\ell } } { 24}h_{4}(x_{\\ell } ) + \\frac{k_{3,\\ell } ^{2}}{72}h_{6}(x_{\\ell } ) & + ... , \\left .",
    "\\right ] , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the @xmath2-th cumulant of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the hermite polynomial of @xmath2-th order .",
    "notice that the ee has the same norm , mean and variance as the gaussian , but different mode ( the peak of the distribution ) .",
    "here , as a first step , we limit ourselves to the first non - gaussian term containing the skewness @xmath30 .    assuming that @xmath28 is distributed according to the edgeworth expansion",
    ", we can build the truncated edgeworth likelihood function @xcite to first order in @xmath30 : @xmath31 , \\ ] ] with @xmath32 .",
    "now , integrating over @xmath33 we obtain@xmath34 dw= &   & \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi } { \\alpha } } e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\gamma -\\frac{\\beta ^{2}}{\\alpha } \\right ) } \\left [ 1+\\frac{1}{6}g(k_{3,\\ell } , \\delta _ { \\ell } , \\sigma _ { \\ell } ) \\right ] , &   & \\label{edgelik } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath35 this is the likelihood function that we study below .",
    "the effect of the extra terms is to shift the peak ( or mode ) of the distribution of each @xmath0 while leaving the mean unperturbed .",
    "since the shift depends on @xmath36 , @xmath15 and @xmath30 , the resulting _ mode spectrum _ will be distorted with respect to the _",
    "mean spectrum_. therefore , the likelihood maximization will produce in general results that depend on @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the peak shift introduced in the simplified case in which the skewness is independent of @xmath1 : if @xmath37 is _ negative _ , the spectrum is shifted _ upward _ by a larger amount at the very small and very large multipoles , and by a smaller amount around @xmath38 , where the relative errors are the smallest ; if @xmath37 is positive the shift is downward . as a consequence of the distortion , we expect that a constant negative skewness favours spectra which are tilted downward with respect to the gaussian case , and the contrary for a positive skewness . in general",
    ", the cosmological parameters will depend on the multipole dependence of @xmath30 . for small @xmath39 ,",
    "the shift can be approximated by@xmath40 clearly , if the peak shift introduced by the ee were independent of @xmath1 , the integration over the amplitude @xmath33 would erase the non - gaussian effect on the likelihood .",
    "that is , putting @xmath15 and @xmath36 equal to a constant independent of @xmath1 we obtain @xmath41",
    "to evaluate the likelihood , a library of cmb spectra is generated using cmbfast @xcite .",
    "following @xcite i adopt the following uniform priors : @xmath42 @xmath43  @xmath44 . as extra priors , the value of @xmath4 is confined in the range @xmath45 and the universe age is limited to @xmath46 gyr .",
    "the remaining input parameters requested by the cmbfast code are set as follows : @xmath47 @xmath48 in the analysis of @xcite @xmath49 , the optical depth to thomson scattering , was also included in the general likelihood and , in the flat case , was found to be compatible with zero at slightly more than 1@xmath50 . therefore here , to reduce the parameter space , i assume @xmath49 to vanish .",
    "the theoretical spectra are compared to the data from cobe @xcite and boomerang @xcite .    to specify the skewness @xmath30 three simplified cases",
    "are studied : in the first one ( `` constant skewness '' ) , @xmath51 is assumed independent of the multipole @xmath1 ; in the second ( `` gaussian skewness '' ) , the skewness is assumed to be generated by some process only in a particular range of multipoles:@xmath52 where , in the numerical examples below , i put @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the third case ( `` hierarchical skewness '' ) ,",
    "the `` hierarchical '' ansatz is assumed @xcite , in which the skewness of the temperature field is proportional to the square of its variance . at the first order",
    ", we can assume that the skewness of the @xmath0 distribution is proportional to the skewness of the fluctuation field , so i put@xmath55 where , for instance , @xmath56 .",
    "in all three cases @xmath57 is left as a free parameter .",
    "these three choices are of course purely an illustration of what a real physical mechanism might possibly produce .    fig .",
    "2 shows the one - dimensional edgeworth likelihood functions marginalized in turn over the other three parameters . for the `` constant skewness ''",
    ", @xmath58 varies from -1.6 to 1.2 ( light to dark curves ) : below and above these values the likelihood begins to show pronounced negative wings , which signals that the first order edgeworth expansion is no longer acceptable . while the likelihood for @xmath59 is almost independent of @xmath37 , it turns out that the other likelihoods move toward higher values for higher skewness .",
    "as anticipated , this can be explained by observing that a higher skewness implies smaller @xmath0 at small multipoles : a tilt toward higher @xmath2 and higher @xmath60 gives therefore a better fit .",
    "the effect is of the order of 10% for @xmath61 .    in the `` gaussian skewness '' case",
    "the trend is qualitatively the opposite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath58 ranges from -4 to 4 ( light to dark ) . here",
    "the cosmological parameters decrease for an increasing skewness .",
    "the reason is that now the effect is concentrated around the intermediate multipoles @xmath62 : a positive skewness induces smaller @xmath0 at these multipoles , and therefore a smaller @xmath2 and @xmath60 helps the fit .",
    "the third case , the `` hierarchical skewness '' , is not shown because is qualitatively similar to the previous case : the region around @xmath38 is in fact also the region where @xmath0 is larger and therefore @xmath30 given by eq .",
    "( [ hier ] ) is larger .",
    "4 summarizes the results : the trend of the estimated parameters ( mean and standard deviation ) versus @xmath57 in the `` constant skewness '' case .",
    "the constant plateau that is reached for @xmath63 depends on the fact that for large and negative skewness the peak shift is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "the cosmological parameters can be well fitted by the following expressions :    @xmath64    for @xmath4 the fit is @xmath65 .",
    "notice that the trend for @xmath4 is stronger than for the other variables : @xmath4 goes from 0.65 to 0.85 when @xmath37 increases from -1.6 to 1.2 .",
    "similar relations can be found for the other cases as well .",
    "this paper illustrates quantitatively a basic and obvious fact about cosmological parameter estimation , namely the dependence on the underlying statistics . although the gaussianity of the cmb data is still to be proved , almost all the previous works estimated the cosmological parameters assuming vanishing higher order cumulants . here",
    "it has been shown that a non - zero skewness distorts the mode spectrum with respect to the mean spectrum , inducing a considerable variation to the best fit cosmological parameters .",
    "the edgeworth expansion we used in this paper is convenient for analytical purposes but its use is limited to relatively small deviations from gaussianity .",
    "in fact , the peak shift displayed in fig.1 is always smaller than the errobars , and as a result the parameters , although varying with @xmath37 , remain always within one sigma from the zero - skewness case .",
    "this , however , does not mean that the dependence on the higher order moments can be neglected , first because it is a systematic effect , and second because more general probability distributions which are not small deviations from gaussianity might introduce much larger shifts .",
    "we have shown that , to first order , the peak shift @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "the error @xmath15 includes cosmic variance and experimental errors . in the future",
    ", the main source of error will be cosmic variance , at least below @xmath68 or so .",
    "a skewness of order unity will therefore introduce an additional `` skewness bias '' that will limit the knowledge of the cosmological parameters by an amount similar to the cosmic variance itself . at this point",
    "it will become necessary to estimate @xmath30 along with the other parameters .",
    "the first order ee is however inadequate , since it is linear in @xmath30 , and it will be necessary to extend the expansion to higher orders @xcite , or to adopt a non - perturbative non - gaussian distribution .",
