    "the atmospheric helium abundances of sdbs are poorly understood . from the typical abundance patterns of these stars , which show a depletion of light elements as well as an enrichment of heavy metals , it has been concluded that diffusion play an important role in their atmospheres . however , diffusion models predict an almost total depletion of helium in contrast to what is observed .",
    "the helium abundances of sdbs range from slightly above solar down to @xmath3 .",
    "mass loss caused by stellar winds as well as extra mixing in the atmosphere have been invoked to counteract gravitational settling and explain the observed helium abundances ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite found a correlation of helium abundance with temperature .",
    "the hotter the sdb , the more helium is present in its atmosphere .",
    "similar correlations have been found by other groups ( see e.g. vennes et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "however , @xcite also reported the discovery of two distinct sequences showing a similar correlation with temperature , the  lower sequence  being offset by about @xmath4 from the upper sequence .",

    "those sequences could not be clearly identified in other datasets so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite combined the then published data sets and found the stars of the upper sequence to lie near the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) band in the @xmath5-plane , as expected , whereas the lower - sequence stars lie in a much more dispersed area ( see figs .",

    "gravitational settling can also lead to isotopic anomalies in stellar atmospheres . in the case of helium",
    "the light isotope @xmath0he can be enriched with respect to the usually much more abundant @xmath6he .",
    "such an enrichment has initially been found in main sequence b stars with subsolar helium abundance @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite detected strong line shifts in the sdb star sb290 and the blue horizontal branch star phl25 indicating that basically the whole helium content of the atmosphere consists of @xmath0he .",
    "later on @xcite and @xcite found another three sdbs , where @xmath0he is enriched in the atmosphere .",

    "the correlation of helium abundance with temperature discovered by @xcite can be clearly seen as well as the two distinct sequences showing a similar correlation with temperature .",

    "searches for the @xmath0he isotope in stellar atmospheres have so far been restricted to a few stars only .",
    "the high resolution spectra are perfectly suited to search for small shifts in the rest wavelengths of the helium lines due to the enrichment of @xmath0he .",
    "those shifts can be modelled quite accurately and show a typical pattern .",
    "while some lines like hei5876 are only shifted by @xmath19 towards redder wavelengths , the shifts of hei4922 and hei6678 are significant ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , * ? ? ?",
    "displacements of this order can be easily detected in the high resolution spectra .",
    "the spy sample @xcite has not been studied , because the uves spectra did not cover the sensitive hei6678 line .",
    "all stars of our sample have been examined . in 8 cases isotopic shifts due to the presence of @xmath0he are clearly visible ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : isotop ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath22 of our programme stars show the @xmath0he anomaly . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : abun ] seven belong to the upper helium sequence , while only one star belongs to the lower sequence .",
    "this may be a selection effect , because sdbs with low helium abundance show only weak lines , which are less suited to detect isotopic shifts .",
    "the distribution of these stars in the @xmath23-@xmath24-diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tefflogg ] including the three sdbs with isotopic shifts taken from literature .",
    "it can be clearly seen that they cluster in a narrow temperature range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 with bd+482721 ( @xmath25 ) being the only exception .",
    "given the uncertainties , this @xmath0he - strip may be pure .",
    "most stars show clear shifts of the hei line at @xmath26 indicating that almost all helium in the atmosphere is @xmath0he .",
    "bd+482721 , ec12234@xmath272607 and pg1519 + 640 show strong lines of @xmath0he blended with weak components of @xmath6he .",
    "these three stars cover the whole @xmath0he temperature strip .",
    "the isotope ratio is therefore not correlated to the effective temperature .",
    "an @xmath0he isotope anomaly has first been found for chemically peculiar main sequence stars of spectral type b. the @xmath0he - stars were found at effective temperatures between @xmath28 and @xmath29 separating helium - poor stars at lower @xmath23 from helium - rich stars at higher @xmath23 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tefflogg ] a similar pattern can be seen for the sdbs .",
    "the stars enriched in @xmath0he occupy a small strip in @xmath23 , while the helium abundance decreases towards lower temperatures and rises towards higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite carried out diffusion calculations and predict a mild enrichment of @xmath0he , but due to gravitational settling of the heavier isotope this should be the case in all sdbs .",
    "hence , the @xmath0he strip stars lacks an explanation .",
    "@xcite argued that diffusion is responsible for this effect . at low temperatures",
    "the radiation pressure is not strong enough to support helium in the atmosphere .",
    "as soon as the temperature reaches a certain threshold value , the less massive @xmath0he can be supported , but not the more abundant @xmath6he .",
    "this leads to an enrichment of @xmath0he in the atmosphere . at even higher temperatures",
    "both isotopes are enriched and the isotopic anomaly vanishes as the helium abundance rises .",
