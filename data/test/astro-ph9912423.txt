    "optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data carry the richest and most detailed information .",
    "in particular , since the grb counterparts might heavily suffer from dust obscuration within the host galaxy , the nir data , less affected by this extinction , are more effective than the optical ones for the study of the counterpart itself and of the circumburst medium , and , ultimately , in determining the nature of the grb progenitors ( see e.g. dai & lu 1999 ) .",

    "this grb lasted about 45 s in the grbm 40700 kev band , in which it reached a @xmath5ray peak flux of ( 3.7 @xmath6 0.1)@xmath710@xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 and showed a complex and multi - peaked structure .",
    "the wfc ( 226 kev ) data indicate that grb990705 had a similar duration and lightcurve in the x  rays , and that it displayed very bright x  ray emission with a peak intensity of about 4 crab .",

    "images are composed of a number of elementary coadded frames acquired by dithering the telescope by several arcsecs every 60  s.    reduction of the images was performed with iraf and the stsdas packages .",
    "each image was reduced by first subtracting a mean sky , obtained from frames just before and after the source image .",
    "then , a differential dome flatfield correction was applied , and the frames were registered to fractional pixels and combined . before frames were used for sky subtraction , stars in them were eliminated by a background interpolation algorithm ( _ imedit _ ) combined with an automatic `` star finder '' ( _ daofind _ ) .",
    "we calibrated the photometry with stars selected from the nicmos standard list ( persson et al .",
    "the stars were observed in five positions on the detector , and were reduced in the same way as the source observations .",
    "formal photometric accuracy based only on the standard star observations is typically better than 3% .",

    "midas_.    in order to calibrate the images to the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system , we acquired on july 7 a @xmath16 frame of part of selected area 95 with the 2.2-meter telescope and on july 10 @xmath1 frames of the pg 1323@xmath20086 , pg 2213@xmath20006 and mark a sequences ( landolt 1992 ) with antu ; we adopted as airmass extinction coefficients 0.11 for the @xmath1 and 0.25 for the @xmath16 .    with this photometric calibration , for comparison , the usno - a1.0 star u0150_02651600 , with coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath2 = 5@xmath21 09@xmath22 42@xmath2359 , @xmath24 = @xmath2072@xmath25 07@xmath4 41@xmath122 ,",
    "has @xmath16 = 18.72 and @xmath1 = 17.64 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath16 calibration frames were obtained under poor photometric conditions ( see table 1 ) and therefore the uncertainty on the zero point of the calibration ( @xmath60.25 mag ) is by far the main source of error in the measure of the @xmath16 magnitude of the usno star .",
    "no color term was applied in the @xmath1-band calibration since only @xmath1 frames were taken on july 10 ; so , the uncertainty on the @xmath1 zero point is @xmath60.15 mag .",
    "these large errors are also due to the high airmass ( larger than 2 ) affecting our observations . the @xmath16 and @xmath1 magnitude errors quoted in the next section are only statistical and do not contain any possible zero point offset .",
    "we evaluated the galactic hydrogen column density in the direction of grb990705 using the nrao maps by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , from which we obtained @xmath26 = 0.72@xmath710@xmath27 @xmath9 and , using the empirical relationship by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) , we computed a foreground galactic absorption @xmath28 = 0.40 .",
    "this , by applying the law by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , corresponds to @xmath29 = 0.13 and to @xmath30 = 0.33 ; using the law by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) we then derived @xmath31 = 0.53 and @xmath32 = 0.07 . the intrinsic value of @xmath26 in that region of the lmc is less than @xmath3310@xmath34 @xmath9 ( mcgee et al .",
    "1983 ) ; therefore , the reddening induced by the lmc on the nirt / ot is practically negligible .",
    "the summed 20-min ntt image of july 5.9 ( fig .",

    "1 , right panel ) . astrometry done on the first ntt observation using several stars from the usno - a1.0 catalogue gives for this fading source coordinates @xmath2 = 5@xmath21 09@xmath22 54@xmath2352 , @xmath24 = @xmath2072@xmath25 07@xmath4 53@xmath121 ( j2000 ) with a 1-@xmath35 accuracy of 0@xmath123 .",
    "this object is inside the intersection of all the mentioned x  ray error boxes , and almost at the center of the _ bepposax _ wfc error circle .",
    "moreover , the observed brightness variation and the variability timescale are similar to those of previously observed optical afterglows .",
    "this leads us to conclude that it is the nir afterglow of grb990705 ( we can exclude a lmc microlensing event since these phenomena show a completely different behaviour : see sackett 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "no object is detected in the @xmath14-band july 7.6 composite image .",
    "an upper limit @xmath14 @xmath19 13.9 with a 3@xmath35 significance within a 3 pixel radius aperture at the location corresponding to the @xmath0-band detection is measured .",
    "assuming a temporal power - law decay @xmath36 between the two @xmath0-band detections , we find that @xmath2 = 1.68 @xmath6 0.10 .",
    "including the @xmath0-band upper limit and fitting a power law the decay exponent is @xmath2 = 1.84 @xmath6 0.05 , but the fit is not acceptable ( @xmath37 = 16.8 ) . in the following",
    "we will thus consider @xmath2 = 1.7 as the decay index of the early part of the afterglow while , @xmath111 day after the grb , the transient has probably started a faster decay with a power - law index @xmath2@xmath4 @xmath19 2.6 , based on the second @xmath0-band detection and the @xmath0-band upper limit .",
    "we note however that the paucity of the data makes difficult to precisely locate the epoch at which the decay slope has changed .",
    "antu @xmath1-band observations , albeit with lower significance , due to the faintness of the object and to poorer weather conditions ( see table 1 ) , are consistent with the nir decay : indeed a fading optical object at a position consistent with that of the nirt is detected . on july 6.4",
    "this object was at @xmath1 = 22.0 @xmath6 0.2 , while two days later it was below the limiting magnitude of the frame ( @xmath1 = 23.0 , 3@xmath35 level ) .",
    "these values indicate a power - law decay with an index @xmath38 1.0 , consistent with the nir observations .",
    "the object is not seen in the 2.2-meter @xmath16 frame of july 6 down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath16 = 21.9 and in the @xmath1 frame acquired with the same telescope on july 7 down to @xmath1 = 22.3 ( both values have a 3@xmath35 significance ) .",
    "the nir and optical photometry is reported in fig .",
    "2 , where the @xmath0-band early decay is also modeled as a power law .    inspection of the antu summed 30-min image of july 10 ( see fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) shows an irregular extended object at the location of the nirt and of the ot .",
    "we estimate that the magnitude of this object ( @xmath11 2@xmath124@xmath70@xmath128 in size ) is @xmath1 = 23.8 @xmath6 0.2 . due to the poor resolution",
    "we are not able to exclude that this feature ( or a portion of it ) is due to the contribution of many unresolved sources in the lmc and/or background faint sources .",
    "our photometric analysis of the field , however , reveals only one possible point - like object at @xmath1 = 23.99 @xmath6 0.07 in this area southward of the nirt .",
    "after comparison of positions of field stars in antu and ntt images , the position of the point - like object is not completely consistent with that of the nirt , being @xmath111@xmath122 ( i.e. more than 4@xmath35 ) away from it ( in the first antu image , where the ot is detected , the extremely bad seeing hampers a significant positional comparison ) . assuming that the point - like source is the transient , it is hard to explain this offset as the result of a possible contribution of the extended source in the first @xmath0-band observation , because if this effect were present , the centroid of the nirt+galaxy blend would be expected to be closer to the fuzziness center than that observed in the first ntt observation .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1-band temporal decay would be much slower than that in the nir ( @xmath39 @xmath11 0.9 ) .",
    "therefore we suggest that the point - like object seen on july 10 is unrelated to the grb , and might rather be a structure of the host galaxy , or possibly a foreground star .",
    "the transient , as observed about 0.8 days after the grb trigger , is fairly red . in order to evaluate its color index between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands , we assumed in the @xmath1 band a temporal decay similar to that observed in the @xmath0 band and computed the @xmath1 magnitude at the epoch of the second @xmath0-band observation ( july 6.416 ) . then , we subtracted from this @xmath1 magnitude the contribution of the nebulosity and of the neighboring point - like object ( which is blended with the ot in the july 6.4 image ) and from the @xmath0 magnitude of july 6.4 the upper limit of the third @xmath0-band observation ( @xmath0 @xmath19 19.9 ) .",
    "finally , we corrected for the galactic extinction in the direction of grb990705 .",
    "we find @xmath40 = 3.5 @xmath6 0.2 on july 6.416 ; if instead the host galaxy contribution is much fainter than the third epoch upper limit , and therefore negligible in the second @xmath0-band measurement , the color index is @xmath40 = 3.8 @xmath6 0.2 .",
    "both values imply a spectral slope @xmath41 @xmath11 2 assuming a spectral energy distribution @xmath42 .",
    "this spectral slope would result in a magnitude @xmath14 @xmath11 15.4 at that epoch , i.e. @xmath111.5 magnitudes fainter than , and therefore fully consistent with , the upper limit from the spirex observation of more than one day after .",
    "the afterglow of grb990705 is an unprecedented case of a grb counterpart first clearly detected in the nir band .",
    "the detection of a possible underlying galaxy might support the extragalactic nature of this grb although we can not completely rule out an association with the lmc .",
    "if the extended emission detected is the host galaxy of grb990705 it seems to have a rather knotty and irregular shape since no regular pattern of increasing surface brightness is observed in this structure ( see fig .",
    "3 , right panel ) .",
    "the present data therefore suggest that the host of grb990705 is an irregular ( possibly starburst ) galaxy as was proposed in other cases of grb hosts ( see e.g. sahu et al .",
    "1997 for the host of grb970228 , and bloom et al .",
    "1999 and fruchter et al .",
    "1999b for the host of grb990123 ) .    with @xmath1 @xmath11 23.1 , and assuming it is an irregular starburst galaxy with a flat optical spectrum ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999b ) , we obtain for this object @xmath43 22.8 . using the cumulative surface density distribution of galaxies in the @xmath44 band by hogg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the probability @xmath45 of a chance coincidence between the nir / optical afterglow of grb990705 and the detected galaxy can be evaluated .",
    "we have 2.5@xmath710@xmath46 galaxies per square degree with @xmath47 22.8 ; with this value the probability of finding by chance a galaxy within 3@xmath35 from the position of the nirt is @xmath48 0.006 .",
    "this probability suggests the identification of this object with the host galaxy , although it is not completely conclusive .",
    "this putative galaxy has an integrated ( point - like source plus extended object ) unabsorbed magnitude @xmath49 = 22.74 @xmath6 0.15 , an extension of @xmath112 square arcsecs and an irregular shape ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ; therefore , it might be one of the brightest and most extended among the host galaxies of grbs with known redshifts ( grb970228 : sahu et al .",

    "bloom et al .",
    "1999 , fruchter et al .",
    "this might suggest that this object is nearer than the other grbs .",
    "the decay slope of this afterglow , @xmath2 = 1.7 , is rather steep , although not as steep as observed for grb980326 ( groot et al .",
    "1998 ) and grb980519 ( djorgovski et al . 1998 , halpern et al . 1999 ) . from the @xmath0-band light curve decay index we estimate an electron power - law distribution index @xmath50 @xmath11 3 ( sari et al . 1999 ) .    as already outlined in sect .",
    "3 , the @xmath0 magnitude of the nirt on july 6.9 is significantly below the extrapolation of the early decay ( see fig .",
    "this strongly suggests a break in the nirt @xmath0-band light curve at @xmath111 day after the grb and a subsequent steepening , similar to those exhibited by the afterglows of grb990123 ( e.g. castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ) and of grb990510 ( e.g. stanek et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the break can not be accounted for by the electron cooling frequency @xmath51 moving through the @xmath0 band since the expected slope change ( @xmath52 @xmath11 0.25 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) would be much smaller than observed ( @xmath52 @xmath53 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the steepness of the lightcurve decay might suggest beamed emission ( sari et al .",

    ", the slope @xmath2@xmath4 @xmath19 2.6 would be roughly consistent with the expected value ( @xmath2@xmath4 = @xmath54 3 ; sari et al . 1999 ) .",
    "if we place the break at the epoch of the second @xmath0-band measurement , i.e. @xmath1118 hours after the grb trigger , assuming a total isotropically - emitted energy of the ejecta of 10@xmath55 erg and a local interstellar medium density of 1 @xmath56 , we obtain that the angular width of the jet is @xmath57 0.1 , consistent with expected opening angles of grb jets ( sari et al . 1999 ,",

    "we note that the nir / optical spectral slope @xmath41 of the transient on july 6.4 and the measured index of the temporal decay @xmath2 would be inconsistent both with the spherical expansion of a relativistic blast wave ( assumed as a valid approximation of an initially strongly beamed jet ) and with a beamed expansion ( sari et al . 1999 ) . under the hypothesis that the optical / nir spectrum is considerably reddened by absorption within the host galaxy",
    ", we corrected it using the extinction law of a typical starburst at various redshifts ( calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "this approach , which we have adopted also for other grbs with encouraging results ( palazzi et al .",
    "1998 , dal fiume et al .",
    "2000 ) , can be justified under the assumption that the heavy obscuration of this afterglow is due to its location in a high density , and probably star - forming , region .",

    "<S> optical and near - infrared observations of the grb990705 error box were carried out with eso telescopes at la silla and paranal in chile and with the noao spirex 0.6-meter telescope in antarctica . </S>",
    "<S> we detected the counterpart of this grb in the near - infrared @xmath0 band and optical @xmath1 band . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law decline of the near - infrared lightcurve is rather steep with a decay index @xmath2 @xmath3 1.7 in the first hours , and a possible steepening after one day . </S>",
    "<S> broadband spectral analysis of the optical / near - infrared afterglow suggests that this grb took place in a high density environment . a deep optical image obtained at antu ( vlt - ut1 ) about 5 days after the grb trigger shows at the position of the transient an extended object which might be the host galaxy of grb990705 . </S>"
