    "nonlinearities are important in optical systems since they enable us to manipulate light by light .",
    "especially , nonlinearities sensitive to single photons are necessary for quantum optical applications such as optical quantum computation @xcite , entanglement generation @xcite , and quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite . in particular , strong nonlinearities are indispensable for quantum computation , since conditional operations at the single photon level are required to realize elementary gate operations .",
    "however , conventional optical media require very high photon densities to obtain significant nonlinear effects @xcite .",
    "single atom cavity quantumelectrodynamics may offer a possible solution @xcite .",
    "in particular , a cavity can focus all the light in an input beam on a single atom , effectively creating a situation where a single atom is coupled to a one - dimensional light field @xcite .",
    "such a one - dimensional atom is an ideal device for the non - linear manipulation of few photon pulses .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to investigate the response of a one - dimensional atom to one- and two - photon input pulses .",
    "there are many theories for such atom - cavity systems @xcite .",
    "however these theories usually eliminate the quantum state of the field outside the atom - cavity system and therefore the analysis of the precise spatiotemporal coherence of the input and output photon pulses can not be achieved . in our previous work ,",
    "we have therefore presented a theory for one- and two - photon pulses that includes the propagation to and from the system in a bad - cavity regime @xcite , based on a one - dimensional model of light - atom interaction @xcite . in these studies",
    ", we focused on the changes of the photon - photon correlations in time @xcite and in frequency @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of the non - linear interaction with the one - dimensional atom on the shape of one- and two - photon wavefunctions using gaussian input pulses of different pulse lengths . for this purpose",
    ", we first introduce an analysis of the interaction in terms of absorption and transmission processes in section [ sec : level2 ] . the characteristic time scale defining the response of the atom",
    "is given by the dipole relaxation time @xmath0 . in section [ sec : level3 ] , we then analyze the interaction processes for a long pulse length of @xmath1 in terms of pulse amplitude and pulse delay time . from these results",
    ", we can estimate that a maximal non - linear effect should be obtained for a pulse length equal to the dipole relaxation time of the atom . in section [ sec :",
    "level4 ] , we therefore analyze the corresponding interaction processes for a short pulse length of @xmath0 , confirming the dominance of the non - linear effect throughout the short two - photon pulse . the results of the analysis are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : level5 ] .",

    "since the cavity damping rate @xmath3 is much faster than the dipole coupling @xmath4 , the method of adiabatic elimination can be applied to the time evolution of the cavity field @xcite .",
    "this means that the interaction between the atom and the outside field through the cavity field can be expressed by an effective dipole relaxation rate @xmath6 . the dipole relaxation rate @xmath7 describes the dipole damping caused by emissions through the left mirror of the cavity , and the corresponding rate of spontaneous emission through the cavity is equal to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in our case , we assume that the rate of spontaneous emission into the non - cavity modes @xmath5 is negligible ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "nearly all emissions from the atom can then be confined to the cavity and 2@xmath7 is the total spontaneous emission rate of the excited atom in the cavity . in present cavity designs , this can be realized by exploiting the purcell effect .",
