    "superconducting transmission line resonators can be used as quantum data buses , quantum memories , and single microwave photon detectors  @xcite .",
    "they usually work  in the microwave regime and can also be used as quantum nodes in so - called quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the entanglement is one of the most important resources for quantum information processing  @xcite , and microwave photons play a critical role in quantum state control for solid state quantum devices . therefore , engineering arbitrarily entangled microwave photon states is a very fundamental issue for both solid state quantum information processing and quantum optics  @xcite on superconducting quantum chips .",
    "usually , nonclassical photon states of a single - mode cavity field are generated through the interaction between the cavity field and the two - level atom .",
    "the methods of generating nonclassical photon states can be classified into two ways .",
    "one is to engineer appropriate hamiltonians in different evolution durations by tuning experimental parameters when the target state is being generated  @xcite .",
    "the other one is to obtain the target state via appropriately designed measurements  @xcite .",
    "the former one is deterministic , while the latter one is probabilistic and usually has a low probability to succeed .",
    "if the nonclassical state is generated using natural atomic systems , the latter method is usually more practical since most of parameters are not possible or not easy to be tuned .",
    "however , in artificial atomic systems , the former method is more appropriate because system parameters can be artificially controlled .",
    "for example , superconducting quantum circuits ( sqcs )  @xcite provide us a very convenient way to deterministically engineer nonclassical states of a single - mode microwave field by varying the system parameters  @xcite .",
    "the method of deterministically generating entangled photon states using atomic systems can be tracked to that of generating entangled phonon states of two vibrational modes  @xcite , in a trapped ion interacting with laser fields , by using different sideband transitions .",
    "however , the number of steps in such a method  @xcite exponentially depends on the maximum phonon numbers .",
    "a few proposals were put forward to overcome the exponential dependence of the phonon number by introducing auxiliary atomic energy levels  @xcite , using phonon number dependent interactions  @xcite , or employing multiphonon transitions of high phonon numbers  @xcite .",
    "these methods have successfully reduced the number of steps into quadratic polynomials of the maximum phonon numbers .",
    "the generation of entangled microwave photon states of two modes using superconducting qubit has been studied  @xcite , where a classically driven superconducting qubit with time - dependent frequency is coupled to two microwave fields in two separated cavities .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the superconducting qubit and the cavity fields of two modes is described by the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "therefore , there is only single photon transition in each step .",
    "however , the photon - number - dependent stark effects  @xcite induced by the qubit - field coupling make it possible to independently implement operations for photon states .",
    "thus , the number of steps also quadratically depends on the maximum photon number .",
    "it has been shown that the superconducting qubit and the cavity field can have both transverse and longitudinal couplings when the inversion symmetry of the qubit potential energy is broken  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal coupling can induce multiphoton transitions  @xcite in different sidebands as in trapped ions  @xcite and thus arbitrary photon states of a single - mode cavity field can be more conveniently engineered  @xcite . motivated by studies  @xcite , we study a method to generate entangled microwave photon states in two separated cavities coupled by a superconducting qubit using multiphoton transitions .",
