    "the non - centrosymmetric atomic arrangement in the hexagonal unit cell of this system gives rise to the geometric ferroelectricity @xcite . among all compounds in the rare - earth indate series , gdino@xmath4 draws a special attention because of the presence of gd@xmath1 ion , which has exact half - filled 4@xmath8 shell as the outermost orbital .",

    "furthermore , in the literature we find that some of the gd based compounds exhibit the negative thermal expansion ( nte ) . while the mechanism of nte in crystalline gd @xcite is associated with the change in magnetic ordering , the same is attributed to the transverse vibrational motion of two - coordinated pd atom in gdpd@xmath0b@xmath11c@xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the role of gd@xmath1 ions for nte is evident from the rietveld refinement of low temperature x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns .",

    "the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath47 is only @xmath48 ( refer to fig .",
    "[ expansion ] ) , and hence the contribution of volume contraction on the change in the frequency of the phonon modes with lowering of temperature can be neglected .",
    "thus , in fig . [ shift ] we analyze the experimentally obtained data points only by considering the true anharmonic contribution of temperature on the phonon frequency .",
    "the solid red lines are generated by taking into account the four phonon decay process due to the increase in anharmonicity in the vibrational potential with temperature @xcite by following the relations @xmath49 @xmath50 where , @xmath51 is the phonon frequency at 0k , @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are anharmonic constants .",

    "[ shift ] ) . the clear change in the slope of observed phonon frequency of the raman mode at 239 @xmath41 near 150k compelled us to fit the data points with free fitting parameters up to 150k using eqn .",

    "the deviation of the measured frequency of the raman mode near 239 @xmath41 from the expected anharmonic frequency ( solid line ) indicates an additional factor to be responsible for the anomalous shift .",
    "the atomic vibrations related to the raman mode at 239 @xmath41 involve vibration of gd and in ions along the c axis , and is shown in the inset of panel ( a ) in fig . [ shift ] .",
    "it is to be noted that this is the only mode , under study , which involves the vibration of gd ions . the absence of such anomaly in other raman modes ( panel ( b ) to ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ shift ] ) , confirms the role of magnetic gd plane as the origin of the anomalous phonon softening and indicates the magneto - elastic coupling in this system .",
    "here we would like to mention that the plot @xmath39 vs. @xmath55 at 20k , as observed in fig .",
    "[ striction ] , has much lesser slope than that at 1.8k . from this figure",
    "it appears that the spin - lattice coupling is much weaker at 20k .",
    "this , in a way , contradicts the raman results , which exhibit the presence of spin - phonon coupling even at 150k .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that the magnetostriction measurement yields an average effect over all directions . in contrary",

    "the estimated value of @xmath30gd is 0.04  at 300k and only 0.02  at 0k .",
    "the change is very small .",
    "nonetheless , there have been reports on change in magnetic ordering temperature upto 30k with only 0.1% change in lattice parameter @xcite .",
    "we also studied the change in the phonon frequencies with change in the magnetic ordering of the gd ions in gdino@xmath0 . for this purpose",

    "to summarize , we demonstrate nte in hexagonal gdino@xmath0 at the temperature range of 50100k .",
    "the corresponding change in the crystal structure is manifested in the triangular lattice of gd@xmath1 ions .",
    "the onset of spin frustration at 150k with a large frustration parameter hinders the long range magnetic ordering in the system and we find an antiferromagnetic ordering only at a very low temperature .",
