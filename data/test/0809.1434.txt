    "searching for systematic correlations among the global properties of galaxies , analogous to the h - r diagram for stars , may offer the best hope of having a better understanding about their formation and evolution .",
    "the recent availability of large and systematic data - sets at several wavelengths makes this a good time to search .",
    "such searches go back to the optical pioneers of galaxy exploration such as hubble ( 1937 ) , holmberg ( 1965 ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1991 ) and zwicky ( 1942 ) .",
    "the trends and correlations they discovered , re - emerge very clearly in the sloan digital sky survey , as described by blanton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in their analysis of 200.000 galaxies at redshifts of @xmath0 0.1 .",
    "this paper deals with a much smaller sample of galaxies , but ones found by an entirely different technique , i.e. in a blind search for neutral hydrogen gas at 21-cm .",
    "the principal motivations for such a blind search are two .",
    "first of all , by definition , optically selected galaxies already contain many stars , which may not be the case in the younger , or less evolved galaxies , which may have the most to tell us about their formation and evolution .",
    "apart from x - ray searches , which detect the very hot gas in the potential wells of giant ellipticals , most galaxy searches rely , either directly or indirectly , on the presence of stars and so are biased against young or unevolved objects .",
    "secondly , a blind search offers a unique way round the strong optical surface brightness selection effects , which could disguise the very correlations one is looking for . by definition",
    "a galaxy must be separately both luminous enough _ and _ large enough to distinguish it above a sky background which , by galaxy standards , is quite bright . these two _ separate _",
    "requirements squeeze optically selected galaxies into an extremely narrow range of surface brightnesses ( sb ) centred , for a given catalogue , on @xmath1 where : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the minimum apparent luminosity , and the minimum apparent angular radius which the galaxy catalogue will accept ( disney 1999 ) .",
    "the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the detectable range is typically only 3 magnitudes wide .",
    "such a narrow stricture certainly impoverished the old photographic surveys ( disney 1976 , disney & phillipps 1983 , dalcanton 1997 ) .",
    "it might be naively thought that ccds would have cured this stricture .",
    "not so , because they detect galaxies that are both fainter _ and _ smaller than emulsions , their @xmath5 s are ( see equation ( 1 ) ) scarcely any dimmer . on the other hand ,",
    "the limitation with an -selected sample is that it will miss the early type galaxies - which contain very little neutral gas .",
    "according to the sdss survey late types make up the large majority of all galaxies , although they may emit less than their fair share of light ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "blind surveys face four main problems . to reach sources of a given column density of ( n@xmath6 in atoms @xmath7 )",
    "any survey must be at least sensitive enough to find them in the most favourable case , i.e. when they fill the beam . in that case",
    "( minchin 2003 , disney 2008 ) t@xmath8 ( per beam ) @xmath9 @xmath10/[n@xmath6 ( min)]@xmath11 where @xmath10 is independent of dish - diameter d ( because a larger dish projects the same system noise onto a smaller area of sky ) .",
    "since there is a loose correspondence between n@xmath6 and sb ( e.g. swaters et al .",
    "mathematically : @xmath12}~atoms~cm^{-2}\\ ] ] ( disney & banks 1997 ) where @xmath13 is in solar units and @xmath14 is the average sb in b mag arcsec@xmath15 , taken over the same area as n@xmath6 . since the effective sb ( @xmath16 ) of an exponential disc is 2.1 magnitudes brighter than @xmath14 ( salpeter & hoffman 1996 ) column density sensitivity at the @xmath17 level is needed to detect lsbgs ( i.e. @xmath16 @xmath18 25.0 b mag arcsec@xmath15 ) with @xmath13 @xmath19 0.3 ( see section 3 ) , which in turn requires integration times per beam of several hundred seconds - which rendered earlier blind surveys either too insensitive or too impractical to detect lsbgs .",
    "since this difficulty was not recognised until recently , some earlier claims , based on small blind surveys , to set rigid upper limits to the amount of cosmic or the numbers of lsbgs in the universe , must be set aside [ e.g. shostak 1977 , fisher and tully 1981 , zwaan et al .",
    "1997 ] .    the coming of the multibeam detector ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1996 ) was essential to carry out such blind surveys .",
    "hipass , the parkes all sky survey ( meyer et al . 2004 ) used the first multibeam system to survey the entire southern sky , and the north up to + 25@xmath20 .",
    "more than 4000 sources were identified in the southern sky alone .",
    "the equatorial survey , described in this paper , was initially part of hipass , but with an accelerated search so as to exploit the sdss - dr2 optical data when it emerged .",
    "hipass sources are typically more than a degree apart which makes for a real challenge in obtaining complementary optical , and other data , simply because , before sdss , each source required a separate observing campaign .",
    "the strong clustering of galaxies , and of galaxies in particular , makes the identification of the source with an optical candidate quite challenging .",
    "this is true even when both 21-cm and optical velocities are known , for galaxy velocities are strongly clustered too . to be certain that every parkes - detected source was correctly identified with",
    "its optical counterpart would require interferometric follow - up in every case - which is infeasible when one is dealing with hundreds of sources , as here .",
    "we have used interferometry , coupled with simulations , to be certain that only a handful of the remaining sources ( less than 10 ) are still misidentified .",
    "this handful is too small to affect the main correlations .",
    "the equatorial strip survey ( es henceforth ) , reported on here , was a search through hipass cubes between declinations @xmath216and + 10 .",
    "thus 5780 deg@xmath11 of data , in the velocity range between @xmath211280 and + 12700 , were searched largely by eye to come up with 1107 sources ( garcia - appadoo phd thesis 2005 ) .",
    "the equatorial strip was chosen because : ( i ) it was approximately perpendicular to the galactic plane and so it is mostly dark enough to make lsbgs detectable ; ( ii ) it is accessible for follow up with a large range of instruments including the vla , and for some of its area the sdss - dr2 ; ( iii ) it includes the area searched for lsbgs by impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the apm machine ( cawson et al .",
    "1987 ) to scan uk - schmidt plates .",
    "this should eventually lead to an estimate of the number of lsbgs still missing from wide - scale optical surveys .",
    "so long as lsbgs remain a putative reservoir for missing baryons ( e.g. fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) it is important to know this . of the es area , 50 per cent will eventually be scanned by sdss , and 35 per cent of it is already publicly released .",
    "we concentrated our search in the 1700 deg@xmath11 of the es released earlier in dr2 ( abazajian et al .",
    "370 cross identifications were made , and then refined down to only 195 to reduce possible misidentifications to a minimum .",
    "these 195 sources have sdss - dr2 optical diameters ( 50 per cent light diameter and 90 per cent light diameter ) between 0.16 and 6 arcmins ( west et al .",
    "the sdss pipeline photometry on sources of this size was known to be extremely unreliable so we had to devise new techniques to reduce the data ( west phd thesis 2005 ) , which delayed the project by nearly two years .",
    "eventually we will analyse many more es sources already observed with sdss . but",
    "the results found for the first 195 are clear and interesting enough to merit being published now .",
    "we have measured , at 21-cm , the peak flux , the integrated flux , the line width , and the spectral shape ( e.g. two horned or gaussian mainly ) , and in the optical the luminosities at @xmath22 two radii r@xmath23(@xmath24 ) and r@xmath25(@xmath24 ) containing respectively 50 and 90 per cent of the @xmath24-band light , the inclination , the morphology and a fibre nuclear spectrum set either on the nucleus or the brightest hii region . given the strong correlations between some of the colours",
    "this amounts to about a dozen independent measurements , not far short of the 14 desired .",
    "chiefly missing is a rotation curve to spell out the distribution of dark matter .",
    "nevertheless we have sufficient information to hope that some important aspects of galaxy systematics will emerge .",
    "with 13 properties there will be @xmath0 ( 13@xmath2612)/2 @xmath0 80 possible correlations to look for .",
    "the previous largest survey of discs was reported in a remarkable , but largely unremarked paper by gavazzi et al . in 1996",
    "entitled _ the phenomenology of disc galaxies_. they found : ( a ) the mass - to - light ratio in the nir is virtually constant and equal to 4.6 in h - band solar units ; ( b ) population i indicators are all anti - correlated with mass ; ( c ) conversely the luminosity and surface brightness of old stellar populations all increase with mass ; ( d ) bulge components all increase non - linearly with mass ; ( d ) all the above properties are independent of either morphological type or environment .",
    "previous blind surveys , with follow - up optical or nir data , have been carried out by zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , spitzak and schneider ( 1998 ) , rosenberg and schneider ( 2000 ) , minchin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , davies et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , giovanelli et al .",
    "some of the results are discussed in rosenberg et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , rosenberg and schneider ( 2003 ) and minchin et al .",
    "the main results can be summarised briefly as follows :    1 .",
    "all but one galaxy ( minchin et al . 2005 , 2007 )",
    "seem to have optical counterparts ; 2 .",
    "although spirals predominate , the counterparts cover a wide variety of morphological types and luminosities ; 3 .",
    "there are significant , but not overwhelming , numbers of low surface brightness galaxies ; 4 .   to within the measurement errors all galaxies have the same column densities ( @xmath27 ) and",
    "this is not a selection effect .",
    "the various surveys differ from one another partly in radio sensitivity , but mainly in the quality of their optical or nir follow - up data .",
    "our equatorial survey is distinct in two main respects : a ) we have been fastidious in rejecting all sources where there might be more than one galaxy in or near the beam ; b ) we have available high quality multi - band sdss - dr2 data for every source , data which is both sensitive and uniform , across a wide dynamic range .",
    "rosenberg at al .",
    "( 2005 ) have attempted a similar analysis using , instead of optical , 2mass j - band data .",
    "our most interesting results can be summarised as follows : a ) all galaxies have the same mass - to - light ratio in h - band solar units .",
    "in other words gavazzi s law holds over a dynamic range of 8 mag in absolute luminosity even in -selected galaxies free of optical selection effects .",
    "b ) there is a clear correlation between sb and luminosity .",
    "combined with ( a ) it reveals a correlation between dynamical mass and optical radius cubed , again over a large dynamic range , but now with more scatter .",
    "in other words there is roughly constant global - density for galaxies ( ) .",
    "the virial theorem then implies the same angular velocity , implying they could have rotated no more than 40 times in a hubble epoch .",
    "( c ) all the galaxies have the same global surface density in , that is to say the same -mass divided by optical - radius squared ( r@xmath11 ) ; ( d ) all the galaxies have exponential profiles throughout most of their extents so that @xmath28 is correlated very tightly with @xmath29 ; ( e ) there is a clear colour - luminosity correlation in the sense that more luminous galaxies are redder , which is well known in optically selected samples .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged by section as follows :    \\(2 ) _ the radio observations _ describe the survey , the detection process and the contents of the resulting catalogue .",
    "\\(3 ) _ the optical observations _ looks into the sensitivity of the sdss for picking up large angular - size low surface brightness galaxies , and galaxies with low @xmath30 ratios .",
    "it then discusses the general problem of identifying reliable optical counterparts to sources in blind surveys .",
    "\\(4 ) _ the diversity of sources _ displays complete data sets for a handful of detected objects , ranging from giant spirals to inchoate low surface brightness galaxies , which represent important -selected class types .",
    "a montage of the optical counterparts illustrates their very wide variety .",
    "finally the complete data set is laid out in the form of tables .",
    "\\(5 ) _ the correlations in galaxy properties _ reveals the 5 separate correlations among their properties .",
    "\\(6 ) _ the discussion _ argues that the correlations , despite the small size of the sample , are significant , not unduly affected by distance uncertainties , and compatible with the tully - fisher relation : line - width @xmath0 l@xmath31 , provided @xmath32 @xmath33 1/3 . if no more than 6 physical invariants control galaxies , as we argue , then 5 correlations suggest a degree of organisation among gas - rich galaxies which is surprising , and which must strongly constrain theories as to their formation and evolution .",
    "the observations were carried out with the parkes 64-meter radio telescope using the multibeam system ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1996 ) in which 13 adjacent beams employing 26 receivers track the sky at a rate of 1 degree per minute , returning several times to the same piece of sky weeks apart to minimise interference .",
    "the main characteristics of the survey are listed in table  [ hipass ] .",
    "the hipass catalogue , that is to say the pipeline catalogue of sources based on this raw data , has been released over the years using techniques , and with results described in barnes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , meyer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , zwaan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and wong et al .",
    "our equatorial survey , based on the same raw data , but covering only 5700 deg@xmath11 around the equator ( garcia - appadoo , phd thesis , 2005 ) was analysed much earlier ( 1999 ) with the intention of providing an early source list in time for sdss - dr2 release .",
    "although it used almost identical search methods to hipass , and indeed copies most of them directly , it appears marginally more sensitive than the hipass catalogue of the same region ( wong et al .",
    "2005 ) , perhaps because we had more time to follow up marginal detections with the more sensitive narrow - band system at parkes ( zwaan et al .",
    "2004 ) thus winning fainter signal from noise .",
    "the equatorial survey ( es hereafter ) covers 14 per cent of the entire sky in a band right round the celestial equator from declination -6to + 10 . of this area",
    "about 1700 deg@xmath11 is covered by the 2nd data release of the sdss ( abazajain et al .",
    "2004 ) which we will use as our source of optical information .",
    "[ spadist ] shows the distribution of sources around the sky , both those with sdss - dr2 optical data and those without .",
    "the gaps caused by the galactic plane , as well as the strong peak at an r.a . of @xmath0 12 hours due to the southern extension of the virgo cluster are easily visible , note that the source at 20h r.a . lies in an additional small area of sdss - dr2 coverage that , due to its small size , is not shown in fig .",
    "[ spadist ] .",
    "[ peak ] shows the distributions of es sources in both peak and integrated flux .",
    "as can be seen the distributions for both the es sample with ( hashed ) and the sample without ( clear ) optical data are very similar .",
    "this indicates that the optical sub - sample we will be analysing here is representative of the sample as a whole and hence can be used to characterise the properties of selected galaxies in general .",
    ".[hipass ] summary of survey parameters [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     column ( 5 ) in table [ correlations ] is pertinent to the @xmath34 of the 5 correlations .",
    "unless @xmath35 reasons can be advanced for a dependance of the new observables on previous ones , then the 5 correlations must be independent .",
    "it might , for instance , be argued that @xmath36 should depend on @xmath37 , but that ignores the real differences in ` concentration ' q @xmath38 @xmath37/@xmath36 between galaxies of different morphological type ( e.g. q = 2.3 for pure exponential but q = 4.2 for de vaucouleur profiles ) .",
    "concentration is a crude but quantitative proxy for morphological type , and there is no @xmath35 case for this to be the same among hi - sources .",
    "thus we can argue that the 5 correlations are truly independent .",
    "although the number of galaxies is modest the dynamic range of most of their properties is large ( i.e. more than 7 magnitudes in luminosity , area , m@xmath6 and m@xmath39 ) whilst the correlations are , in a statistical sense , highly significant .",
    "so far as the @xmath40 of the correlations ( our main interest here ) is concerned the sample - size is not an embarrassment , though larger samples will be needed to pin down the @xmath41 of the correlations more precisely .",
    "there is moreover a great diversity of galaxy types in the sample , ranging between early - type giant spirals and tiny ` inchoates ' of such low surface brightness that they would usually be , and indeed were , missed in optical surveys .",
    "the difficulty of making a reliable census of galaxies in light alone is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ sblum ] where it can be seen that at all luminosities galaxies can vary in sb over 3 or 4 magnitudes , making the dimmest of them , even the giants , hard to pick out from the background by optical means alone .",
    "the narrow sb range of earlier catalogues ( freeman 1970 , disney 1976 ) was almost certainly a selection artefact .",
    "two correlations in particular need explaining .",
    "correlation ( e ) , i.e. m@xmath6 @xmath0 r@xmath42 could be related to the stability of a gas layer to gravitational collapse , and hence to a trigger for star formation ( e.g. kennicutt 1989 , schaye 2008 ) .",
    "the other , the sb / luminosity correlation ( a ) has considerable scatter ( fig . [ sblum ] )",
    "making it difficult to pin down an accurate value for @xmath43 in @xmath44 , where @xmath43 is not far from 1/2 . combining our data with the goldmine sample , in order to increase sample - size and",
    "hopefully reduce scatter , yields @xmath45 , or @xmath46 , or @xmath47 = constant or , considering gavazzi s law , m@xmath39/r@xmath48 = constant ( @xmath0 1 h atom @xmath49 within the optical radius ) which , see fig .",
    "[ 21b ] , is a pretty good fit .",
    "so the mass - and luminosity - density of galaxies is more or less independent of their luminosity .",
    "this is at least a better mnemonic for recalling the rather scattered sb / lum law .",
    "if true the virial theorem implies that all hi galaxies spin at the same angular velocity and rotate @xmath0 40 times in a hubble epoch .",
    "what about the tully - fisher correlation @xmath50 ?",
    "gavazzi s law ( c ) : @xmath51 while above : @xmath52 , hence @xmath53 . in other words",
    "our data are consistent with the tf law provided @xmath32 = 1/3 [ see also fig .",
    "[ tfg ] ] . the problem with using tf",
    "directly is demonstrated in table [ ranges ] where it can be seen that the low dynamic range in @xmath54 will always make it difficult to find the exponent @xmath32 accurately , and it makes more sense to incorporate @xmath54 into the dynamical mass ( @xmath38 r @xmath55 ) instead , as it is in gavazzi s law ( c ) where it leads to both a clear correlation with luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ gavhgm ] ) and perhaps a natural physical explanation [ ` all galaxies are made of the same stuff ' ] .",
    "the distance to most galaxies in our radial velocity range can be problematic so it is important to ask if and how distance uncertainties will affect the correlations . where there is a difference ( last column ) between the distance - dependant exponents @xmath56 in our list one expects distance uncertainties to introduce extra scattering to correlations , as for instance in ( a ) but not in ( e ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tightest correlations observed i.e. ( d ) and ( e ) are the ones unaffected by distance uncertainties , whilst the loosest , i.e. ( a ) [ fig .",
    "[ colourmag ] ] and ( b ) [ fig .",
    "[ sblum ] ] should indeed be the strongest affected .",
    "this hints that distance uncertainties probably are increasing the scatter . on the other hand look at gavazzi s relation ( b ) and in particular figures [ dynlum ] and [ gavhgm ] .",
    "there is no increase in scatter when we come to lower radial velocities where one might expect the relative distance - uncertainties to have the most pernicious effect on the correlations .",
    "this suggests that although distance uncertainty can increase scatter , that increase must be rather limited here , and exculpates the uniform but rather crude distances we have adopted .",
    "note also that only 1 observable is size , and hence distance dependant ( r @xmath57 ) while 5 are not , i.e. @xmath58 and concentration @xmath59 .",
    "this implies strong correlations among @xmath60 galaxy properties ( e.g. colour and sb , @xmath54 and ) i.e. ones that have nothing to do with either scale or distance .",
    "how constraining could the five discussed correlations ( a ) to ( e ) be on theories of galaxy formation and evolution ? that depends on how many fundamental , independent invariant physical properties galaxies might posses .",
    "at present it is hard to imagine more than 7 : total mass , baryon fraction , age , angular momentum , random energy , radius and central condensation .",
    "once a galaxy has virialised , the virial theorem will provide one relation between them , leaving only 6 independent properties .",
    "ignoring interactions one might expect , to first order , that these properties might be conserved by each galaxy though , on a secular time - scale some random energy might be dissipated , while some baryons might be ejected .",
    "thus five correlations ( if they are truly independent ) within a six - parameter set hint at a high degree of organisation among gas - rich galaxies , something partially foreshadowed by the early pioneers [ brosche 1973 , balkowski 1973 ] .",
    "we are presently carrying out a principal component analysis to investigate the degree of organisation in this data .",
    "on the observational front work in progress by us includes enlarging the sample size as more sdss and data [ e.g. from the bonn 100 metre multibeam survey ( kerp et al . in preparation ) becomes available .",
    "our automated sdss photometric pipeline for large galaxies should greatly accelerate progress ( west et al .",
    "interferometry is being obtained , first to sort out identifications in tight groups and second to measure more actual radii to get a better understanding of the minchin - rosenberg effect .",
    "so far we have exploited neither the colours nor the fibre spectra but work is in hand to include them too ( west et al . in preparation ) . statistical work on mean cosmic properties , such as the mean cosmic density , depends on a clear understanding of ones selection effects and",
    "this is underway too ( garcia - appadoo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we are also working on the reverse list , that is to say a list of objects in the sdss survey which we would have expected to contain measurable , and thus show up in the equatorial survey , but which do not ( west & garcia - appadoo in preparation ) .",
    "mjd would like to thank the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) for grants towards the support of both construction and exploitation of the hipass and hijass ( hipass northern equivalent at jodrell bank ) surveys , and especially thank the hipass team , notably professors lister staveley - smith , ron ekers and dr a. e. wright of the australia telescope at csiro radiophysics in sydney , for the inspiration and drive which first got the multibeam project going .",

    "<S> we have used the parkes multibeam system and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to assemble a sample of 195 galaxies selected originally from their signature to avoid biases against unevolved or low surface brightness objects . for each source 9 </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic properties are measured homogeneously , as well as inclination and an optical spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the sample , which should be almost entirely free of either misidentification or confusion , includes a wide diversity of galaxies ranging from inchoate , low surface brightness dwarfs to giant spirals . despite this diversity </S>",
    "<S> there are 5 clear correlations among their properties . </S>",
    "<S> they include a common dynamical mass - to - light ratio within their optical radii , a correlation between surface - brightness and luminosity and a common surface - density . </S>",
    "<S> such correlation should provide strong constrains on models of galaxy formation and evolution .    </S>",
