    "photosynthesis , arguably the most important photo - induced process on earth , converts the energy of light into its chemically / biologically useful form .",
    "it is often argued that this conversion is remarkably efficient .",
    "however , it has to be distinguished between the _ quantum _ efficiency , reaching almost unity@xcite , and light - to - chemical energy efficiency , which is significantly lower , in the order of several percent@xcite .",
    "this is given by an evolutionary pressure on the development of a robust photosynthetic machinery optimized for survival rather than energy conversion efficiency .",
    "energy relaxation processes are integral part of the photosynthetic function as they enable the energy transfer to proceed unidirectionally @xcite , and provide protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against harmful over - excitation .",
    "the photosynthetic machinery of plants has developed a complex hierarchy of self - regulatory mechanisms to avoid excess excitation or ( when unavoidable ) to dissipate it into heat @xcite .",
    "starting from processes controlled on the macroscopic level ( e. g. orientation of leaves ) , over spontaneous microscopic ( cellular ) events such as chloroplast movements , to truly nano- and sub - nanoscopic mechanisms such as reorganization of antenna complexes and direct regulation of energy transfer on the level of small groups of interacting chromophores , plants actively react to changing illumination conditions .",
    "the sub - nanoscopic processes , which are the focus of the present study , operate in response to the increase of @xmath0 across the thylakoid membrane .",
    "such an increase is an indicator of high illumination .",
    "nowadays it is generally accepted that carotenoids are involved in these energy dissipation processes .",
    "the precise molecular mechanism is , however , still subject of discussion@xcite .",
    "it is likely that different mechanisms evolved in different classes of organisms and/or that several mechanisms operate at once .",
    "most of our current knowledge about the early processes of photosynthesis was obtained by ultrafast spectroscopy . while conventional bulk spectroscopies are extremely useful in following ultrafast photo - induced events in photosynthesis , whenever structural inhomogeneity of the sample is involved , the information obtained from these spectroscopies becomes obscured by an inevitable ensemble averaging .",
    "some well established spectroscopic methods , such as hole - burning @xcite , and some modern multidimensional methods , such as coherent two - dimensional spectroscopy @xcite , provide certain access to the homogeneous properties .",
    "information on the behaviour of individual molecules has been , however , available only since the advent of single - molecule spectroscopy ( sms ) @xcite .",
    "the system studied in this work , the light harvesting complex ii ( lhcii ) of higher plants , is the plants major light - harvesting antenna containing almost half of all the chlorophyll in the chloroplast .",
    "correspondingly , most of the light absorption and subsequent energy transfer processes in plants and algae occur in this complex .",
    "the lhcii antenna occurs naturally in a trimeric form and its main function is to deliver excitation energy to the nearby photosystem ii ( psii ) .",
    "given the major role of lhcii in light - harvesting and energy transfer , it is not surprising that it is also implicated in participating in regulated energy dissipation , the so - called non - photochemical quenching ( npq ) @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of the complex @xcite enables us efficient theoretical modeling of the complex s spectroscopic properties using its chromophores ( chlorophylls ( chl ) and carotenoids ) as the model units .",
    "the model parameters such as electronic coupling are greatly constrained by the known mutual orientation and distances .",
    "existence of a large body of previous measurements together with theoretical attempts to fit this whole body of data to a single model @xcite gives a great confidence in extending the modeling towards single molecular experiments .    in recent years , single - molecule spectroscopy ( sms ) experiments on several photosynthetic antenna complexes including the lhcii were performed .",
    "fluorescence spectral peak distributions @xcite , spectral diffusion @xcite , fluorescence intensity distributions @xcite and time traces @xcite were obtained from these measurements . in many cases also",
    "fluorescence intermittency ( blinking ) was observed , and it was conjectured that in the case of lhcii the process behind the fluorescence intermittency plays a role in npq @xcite .",
    "as far as the theory of the sms of lhcii is concerned , the ensemble - averaged spectra and also the peak distributions of lhcii trimers can be successfully explained by the disordered excitonic model @xcite . in general , the excitonic model was successfully applied in the past on fs to ps timescale , and it represents an indispensable tool in analyzing ultrafast spectroscopic experiments on molecular aggregates and in particular on photosynthetic antennae@xcite .",
    "its application to longer time scales of seconds and minutes is conditioned by the assumption of a certain separation of time - scales . over the course of the excitation - emission cycle ( nanoseconds ) ,",
    "individual chromophores of a complex are assumed to be found in fixed spatial arrangements and experiencing an environment described by a fixed set of parameters .",
    "the emission spectrum of a complex in such a fixed spatial arrangement is predicted by the excitonic model which gives the population distribution of the excited state manifold and the probability of emission at the corresponding transition frequencies .",
    "the spectrum of exciting light matters only to the extent to which the excited states reached at a given excitation wavelength are connected to the final state by some relaxation pathways .",
    "once the pathways are available , the final state is given irrespective of the initial state after absorption of light . because only the final distribution of excited state population matters , the changes ( switches ) of the spatial arrangement or environmental conditions occurring on the sub - nanosecond time scale are only observed as sudden changes ( with respect to the nanosecond fluorescence time scale ) of the fluorescence spectra . despite the fact that the experiment we analyze in this work does not provide more insight into the sub - nanosecond dynamics of individual complexes than previous works",
    ", we nevertheless formulate the theory consistently in such a way that it enables the description of such processes .",
    "this is done in order to highlight the existence of a less studied type of processes on an intermediate time scale and to stress the need to search for experimental techniques which can cover the range of timescales from femtoseconds to nanoseconds in single molecular spectroscopy .",
    "we thus provide theoretical techniques to treat these future experiments .",
    "we have recently reported a progress towards measuring processes on the order of hundreds of femtoseconds in single light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : excited - state - population ] we first discuss the frenkel exciton model as a basis for the formulation of equations of motion for the populations of the excited states of chromophore aggregates with strong interchromophore couplings .",
    "then , in section [ sub : excited - state - dynamics ] , we introduce equations of motion for excitonic populations valid over a broad ( from ps to min ) timescale range .",
    "we discuss their generality and the range of validity .",
    "it is argued that these equations provide an ideal means for the description of the sms experiments . in section [ sec : lhcii ] the results of section [ sub : excited - state - dynamics ] are applied to lhcii photosynthetic antenna complexes .",
    "all results are compared to the experiment .",
    "it is shown that our equations give correct fluorescence spectrum and peak statistics , i. e. appropriate steady - state population , under typical sms experiment condition .",
    "then we model the intensity traces , while the switching behaviour is included by incorporating one particular previously proposed npq mechanism , namely energy transfer to lutein lut 1 .",
    "the switching between on and off states is controlled by a 2-level model , where the switching causes a change of the chl a612 - lut 1 coupling .",
    "it is shown that using realistic parameters we are able to reproduce the experimental results .",
    "the details of our energy relaxation theory and of the stochastic model of switching are given in supporting information ( si ) .",
    "in the usual sms experiments , time - resolved ( on the times scale of 10 ms to s ) fluorescence of the studied molecules is observed .",
    "if the excited state life time of the studied chromophores is sufficiently long ( nanoseconds in the case of chlorophylls studied here ) , the expected fluorescence spectra can be calculated from the steady state , quasi - equilibriated populations of the excited electronic eigenstates of the molecular system , assuming canonical equilibrium .",
    "depending on the strengths of the chromophore - chromophore resonance interaction and the system - bath couplings , the eigenstates can be approximated either by the excited eigenstates of the electronic subsystem or the excited state of the individual chromophores forming the aggregate . in the present paper , we treat both cases within one formalism provided by the framework of the frenkel exciton model .",
    "the frenkel exciton model provides an excellent tool for the treatment of pigment - protein complexes on femto- and pico - second time scales @xcite .",
    "the basic notion of the frenkel exciton model is the one of localized excited states of the chromophores .",
    "these states have negligible wavefunction overlap with neighboring excited states , and they can therefore be assumed orthogonal to each other , forming a suitable basis for the aggregate hilbert space . in the treatment of linear absorption and fluorescence experiments ,",
    "only singly excited collective states of the molecular aggregate have to be included .",
    "the localized excited states can thus be denoted as @xmath1where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electronic ground and excited states of the chromophore denoted by index @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the states @xmath5 form a complete hilbert subspace for the case that exactly one molecule of the aggregate is excited .",
    "the molecular system hamiltonian , @xmath6 , is however rarely diagonal in the basis of the states @xmath5 and resonance couplings @xmath7 between excited electronic states @xmath5 and @xmath8 occur in all situations interesting for light - harvesting . in the absence of a protein environment ,",
    "the light would resonantly excite eigenstates of the system hamiltonian . in all realistic cases ,",
    "the interaction of the system with its environment co - determines the excitation frequencies , and prescribes thus a `` preferred basis '' of electronic states in which it is the most advantageous to formulate the energy transfer theory .    in the case of the resonance interaction @xmath7 exceeding the typical reorganization energy @xmath9 of the protein bath of the chromophores @xmath4 and @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 , we include @xmath7 explicitly into the system hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain electronic eigenstates , and the effect of the protein bath is included via perturbation theory yielding a redfield type relaxation tensor . in the opposite case",
    "@xmath12 we neglect the resonance coupling in the system hamiltonian , and its effects are included perturbatively yielding frster type energy transfer rates between localized excited states @xcite .",
    "let us first focus on deriving a closed set of equations for the excited state populations .",
    "extensive work was done in the last years on developing methods to accurately describe the system dynamics following an ultrafast excitation by external light . the traditional redfield and",
    "frster approaches were superseded by more accurate ( exact in some cases ) methods , such as heom @xcite , tedopa @xcite and other methods @xcite .",
    "these methods bring unprecedented accuracy at an increased numerical cost .",
    "it seems , however , that for analyzing many of the recent experiments , it is still possible to rely on the traditional tools , as they capture the physics of the problem ( and often even the quantitative aspects of the problem ) very well @xcite .",
    "commonly , equations of motion for some relevant degrees of freedom ( dof ) , electronic states in our case , are derived by reducing the liouville - von neumann equation for the total density matrix to an equation for the so - called reduced density matrix ( rdm ) .",
    "these equations describe time evolution of a molecular system for a fixed configuration of the protein environment ( assuming fast fluctuations around this fixed configuration ) , and they are therefore suitable for the description of ultrafast laser experiments .",
    "however , on the timescale relevant in sms ( up to tens of seconds ) , usage of these equations is actually not appropriate .",
    "first of all , some transient effect at the short times affect even the long time properties of the system and the steady state population dynamics , and second , slow changes in the protein environment can entirely change the energy landscape including the case that one has to change the theoretical limit ( localized states , delocalized states ) in which one works .",
    "the latter case is especially difficult to treat and requires to go beyond the traditional master equation approaches which we apply here . in this work we therefore concentrate on the extension of the validity of the master equation approach towards long times under the assumption that the dependence of the hamiltonian of the system on time is negligible within one absorption emission time scale ( nanoseconds ) .",
    "as for the transient effects at short time , when dealing with fast dephasing of optical coherences , short time transient effects are responsible for the absorption lineshape . this aspect of the transient effects will be taken into account in full .",
    "spontaneous emission of photons by chlorophylls occurs with a nanosecond life - time .",
    "another class of transient effects , namely dynamic electronic coherence due to excitation by light , is therefore also unimportant and its treatment can be avoided .",
    "we therefore derive approximative equations for the populations dynamics only , with the validity in the range from picoseconds to tens of seconds .",
    "initially , our hamiltonian consists of the system , bath and system - bath interaction terms , and we formally assume some total density matrix @xmath13 which follows the liouville  von neumann equation .",
    "there are several methods how to arrive to a master equation ( in a convolution - less form ) rdm @xmath14 @xcite . in general ,",
    "such equation reads :    @xmath15-{\\cal r}(t , t_{0})\\rho(t),\\label{eq : equation_of_motion}\\ ] ]    @xmath16    the total hamiltonian @xmath17 consists of the bath renormalized system hamiltonian @xmath18 and the system - light interaction , which is ( in the dipole approximation ) given by the dipole moment operator @xmath19 and electric field @xmath20 .",
    "the bath is completely eliminated in the reduced description , and its effects are represented by the relaxation tensor @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : equation_of_motion ] ) , the relaxation tensor @xmath21 explicitly depends on some initial time @xmath22 , in which the initial condition for the propagation is set , or more precisely , the relaxation tensor depends on the quantity @xmath23 .",
    "an exact relaxation tensor would also depend on @xmath20 .",
    "in general , the choice of @xmath22 is arbitrary , and we should choose it such that the temporal profile of the excitation field is non - zero for @xmath24 only .",
    "however , in most practical theoretical approaches , the evolution of the bath due to excitation of the system is reflected in the relaxation tensor @xmath21 by the bath correlation function , which decays rather quickly . by choosing @xmath22 sufficiently small",
    ", we could always make such a relaxation tensor constant .",
    "this is obviously an artifact of the approximations used . for a smooth envelope of the external field changing on the same or slower timescale than the correlation function of the bath",
    ", there is no good choice of @xmath22 .",
    "the relaxation tensor always becomes constant too early .",
    "luckily , as we will see below , we do not need to account for the external field @xmath20 beyond first order perturbation theory , and in this regime , there is a natural choice of time @xmath22 which enables us to correctly account for the transient time dependence of the relaxation tensor even for a steady state externally driven by light .",
    "it is important to note , that the relaxation tensor @xmath21 is completely abstract up to now .",
    "it can represent some exact relaxation superoperator , or a result of perturbation theory with respect to some parameters , such as the redfield or frster tensors .",
    "let us now formulate the equations of motion for the excited state evolution in the linear regime of the system s interaction with the electric field .",
    "the validity of the linear regime has been discussed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , and it is the same as the validity of the third order response theory for non - linear laser spectroscopy .",
    "we will also use the secular approximation ( equations of motion for populations @xmath25 and coherences @xmath26 , @xmath27 are assumed independent ) , although this we do only to simplify the resulting equations .",
    "secular approximation could be avoided if one so wishes , at the cost of treating the full dm .",
    "we write explicitly the elements of the rdm of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equation_of_motion ] ) in which we keep the double time dependence of the hamiltonian and the relaxation tensor .",

    "( [ eq : coherence_optical ] ) is actually not a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherences eq ] ) . in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherences eq ] ) numerically , the dephasing rate would quickly become constant for @xmath36 and the transient effects for @xmath37 would be lost completely .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence_optical ] ) these effects are properly taken into account .",
    "the discrepancy between eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherences eq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence_optical ] ) is due to a different treatment of the bath . in a response function approach ,",
    "of which the linearization of the full equations of motion with respect to the field is a variant , it is in general possible to account for the bath in a more consistent way than in master equations . in ordinary master equations ,",
    "the bath is correctly described at @xmath22 , and the description of its subsequent evolution after @xmath22 is extremely limited .",
    "an example of such limitation is discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in most biological energy transferring systems , the pure dephasing is much faster ( hundreds of fs ) than the population relaxation ( units and tens of ps ) .",
    "we can therefore assume that the populations remain constant during the integration in eq .",

    "the dependence on @xmath22 in the upper limit of the integral describes a transient evolution of the optical coherence after switching on the interaction with the field .",

    "the evolution operator changes on an ultrafast time scale , but this timescale is scanned in the integration over the variable @xmath41 .",
    "the properties of the hamiltonian @xmath42 change on a very slow time scale ( with respect to optical dephasing ) , and so does the evolution operator element @xmath43 .",
    "unlike the eq .",

    "the purpose of deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence ft ] ) was to insert it eventually into eq .",
    "( [ eq : populations eq ] ) . also here",
    "we face the problem of transient time dependence of the rates .",
    "however , because populations change much more slowly , these effects are not as important as in the case of coherences .",
    "they can be , however , treated rigorously , even including bath memory effects between evolutions by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherences eq ] ) and eq .",

    "the term @xmath49 would thus be replaced by @xmath50 which can be interpreted as a quantum mechanical expectation value .",

    "the population changes are given by the transfer rates between electronic levels , population quenching and a source terms expressed as an overlap of the excitonic spectra with the light spectrum .",
    "all quantities are in principle dependent on time , most importantly the excitonic absorption spectrum and all rates can weakly depend on time to simulate slow changes of the protein and chromophore configurations . also the light spectrum can be considered time - dependent by generalizing the wiener - khintchine theorem for the instaneous power spectrum @xmath54@xcite .",
    "the changes can be faster than the time resolution of the sms experiment , but they have to be slower than the dephasing , or even energy transfer dynamics .",
    "we should also note here that if we wish to stay strictly in the linear regime , the saturation term @xmath55 in eq .",

    "we define the quenched state by the value of 12 @xmath56 for coupling of the lut 1 to chl 612 and the unquenched state by the zero coupling .",
    "our model allows any type of time dependency of the chl - lut coupling to be used , and it could in principle accommodate input from structure based md studies and quantum chemical treatment of the ( dexter type ) coupling of the chl @xmath58 and the lut s1 states .",
    "however , a much rougher phenomenological model of the chl - lut coupling changes enables a better discussion of the feasibility of the proposed quenching mechanism than the parameter free _ ab initio _ calculations suffering from uncertainties in the structural information .",
    "next we proceed to model the blinking statistics .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the blinking statistics alone can be well described by a two - level model proposed by valkunas et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . by random fluctuations",
    ", the protein samples its potential energy surface ( pes ) performing thus a random walk ( rw ) .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite assumes that there are two stable conformations of the protein corresponding to two minima of the protein pes .",
    "these are approximated by two harmonic potentials .",
    "the protein undergoes a rw in this potential , and at every step it has a certain probability to switch from its current pes to the other pes . in our treatment",
    "we use a discrete rw description , which enables us to follow individual trajectories of the proteins . for the details of the approach taken in this study and the differences from the original model by valkunas et al . , see si and refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to connect the two pes model to our particular lut quenching model , we assume that the change of protein conformation somehow changes the lut - chl coupling .",
    "the lut s1 state does not have a dipole moment , and the resonance coupling similar to those between allowed states does not occur here .",
    "the two different protein conformations responsible for the quenched / unquenched states would then result in two slightly different orientations / positions of the pigments , leading to different strengths of the coupling .",
    "this mechanism is in accord with recent quantum - chemical study by duffy et al .",
    "@xcite , where small configurational changes were found to lead to substantial changes in chl - car couplings .",
    "the switching between the pes is controlled by the rw model with diffusion parameters adjusted to fit the experimental dwell time distributions .",
    "the comparison between the calculated and experimentally determined dwell - times is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : dwell - times]a and [ fig : dwell - times]b , for the on and off times , respectively .",
    "the agreement is again fairly good letting us believe that our phenomenological model captures the most important features of the protein dynamics affecting the blinking behaviour .     experimental ( red ) and calculated ( green ) probability distribution of dwell times in the ( a ) on and ( b ) off state , logarithmic scale .",
    "while the off state distribution follows a power law , the on state distribution has an exponential tail at longer times . ]      finally , we can connect the two models described above and simulate the blinking behaviour . to this end",
    "we continuously model the fluorescence of the lhcii complexes , and output the intensity ( and spectrum ) every 10 ms corresponding to the experimental integration bins .",
    "simultaneously , we let the protein do the rw on its pes , and we adjust the chl / lut coupling , when the protein switches between pes . to obtain more realistic traces , either the site energies or couplings",
    "can be slightly varied after every jump , resulting in different energy levels .",
    "such a procedure , however , does not lead to qualitatively different conclusions and it can be in principle omitted . in the calculations presented here , we used gaussian disorder with the fwhm of 0.3 @xmath56 for couplings and 1 @xmath56 for energies . for every realization of the disorder",
    "a 60 s trace is modelled .",
    "this is repeated for 200 realizations of the disorder , reflecting the experimental conditions .",
    "the resulting statistics are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity - traces - statistics ] .",
    "total dwell times in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity - traces - statistics]a represent the overall amount of time spent in a given intensity level . from this",
    "we can see the two - level character of the blinking and simultaneously also the presence of some intermediate levels , which result from particular disorder realizations .",
    "the dwell times are similar for the on and off states .",
    "[ fig : intensity - traces - statistics]b shows how often are the intensity levels visited per fixed amount of time .",
    "the modelled access frequency distribution is naturally very symmetrical , a direct result of the fact that in the model the complex switches only between the on and off state .",
    "the number of on / off states visited per minute therefore has to be the same .",
    "the experimentally analyzed intensity traces contain also jumps between levels within the on / off states in an amount which can be , to some extent , modified by adjusting the sensitivity of the level analysis .",
    "the presence of these intra - state jumps results in higher switching frequency and wider distribution in intensities , causing a moderate discrepancy between experiment and simulation . in order to include this kind of switching into the model",
    ", dynamic sampling of the disorder would have to be incorporated .",
    "work in this direction will be presented elsewhere .    for the reasons stated above , the level access",
    "frequency distribution is not well suited for comparison of the model with the experiment .",
    "a more appropriate measure of the blinking would be the intensity - intensity correlation function defined as @xmath60 .",
    "this quantity is well - known from single - molecule measurements , where it is often used to characterize the blinking behaviour @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity - traces - statistics]c we present @xmath61 obtained from 50 measured long enough traces , compared with the model .",
    "we can see that the agreement between experiment and theory is good , indicating that our model gives reasonable switching between the intensity levels .",
    "the shape of the correlation function is given by the dwell time statistics , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : dwell - times ] .",
    "the initial fast drop implies the abundance of short blinking events .",
    "this results from the mechanism of the protein switching between its potential surfaces , where the short succesive blinking events are caused by the dynamics in the vicinity of the pes intersection .",
    "experimental ( red ) and calcuated ( green ) intensity blinking statistics .",

    "the two - state structure of the low - intensity off states and higher intensity on states is apparent .",
    "( b ) how often per minute the complexes accessed the respective intensity levels .",
    "the experimental frequency is higher due to switching within the on / off states .",
    "( c ) the intensity correlation function . ]",
    "in section [ sub : excited - state - dynamics ] of the results we derived approximate equations of motion for populations evolution on the timescale of the sms experiment . we have shown that the weak illumination regime , in which the sms experiment is performed , allows for an effective source term description of the light - matter interaction in which short time transient effects arising in the photoinduced evolution of molecular systems can be consistently accommodated side by side with the slow evolution of the protein bath observed in sms experiments .",
    "we demonstrated the validity and scope of application of our equations by simulating our single molecule experiment on lhcii monomers .",
    "based on the recent research in elucidating the npq mechanism in lhcii and the connection between fluorescence quenching and energy dissipation we implemented energy transfer to lut 1 as a blinking mechanism .",
    "based on our calculations we were able to confirm the findings of duffy et al .",
    "@xcite and chmeliov et al.@xcite that , within a reasonable range of parameters , lut 1 can indeed act as an efficient quencher . since our model extends the previous treatment by including realistic excitation conditions and population transfer rates , it is remarkable , how similar our fluorescence quenching dependence on the lut 1 energy is to the one in ref .",
    "moreover , we were able to confirm that lut 1 acts as an efficient quencher also under am1.5 illumination ( data not shown since the dependence is very similar ) . at the same time we can see that the amount of quenching is very sensitive to the change of coupling of the lut to the chlorophylls . since the coupling itself is very sensitive to the distance and orientation between the pigments , it provides a possible link to the protein conformation change working as a switching mechanism as proposed in ref .",
    "indeed , when using the 2-level switching model to control the change of coupling , we are able to reproduce the experimentally obtained blinking statistics .",
    "although far from being exclusive in any way , our argument strongly supports the notion of the protein acting as a conformational switch regulating the amount of quenching in the system .",
    "the agreement between the theory and experiment also serves as a good demonstration of the scope of our equations .",
    "they provide a description for controlling the energy transfer in the system by modulating the parameters of the excitonic model .",
    "we are aware of the remaining phenomenological nature of our connection of the 2-level switching model with the excitonic model .",
    "further improvements in the direction of introducing more parameters with a particular physical meaning , for example the relation to the actual pes shape , are needed and will be subject to further study . also recent experimental observations indicate the presence of more relevant timescales in the intensity traces suggesting the inadequacy of a 2-level model with one reaction coordinate . finally ,",
    "although some connection between the fluorescence blinking and npq was already shown by krger et al .",
    "@xcite , their exact relation is yet to be elucidated .",
