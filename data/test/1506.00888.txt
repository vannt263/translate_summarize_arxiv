    "the path integral ( pi ) has been used in quantum physics since the revolutionary work of feynman  @xcite , although the basic observation goes back to dirac  @xcite who appreciated the rle of the lagrangian in short - time evolution of the wave function , and even suggested the time - slicing procedure for finite , i.e. , non - infinitesimal , time lags .",
    "since then the pi approach yielded invaluable insights into the structure of quantum theory  @xcite and provided a viable alternative to the traditional operator - formalism - based canonical quantization . during the second half of the 20th century ,",
    "the pi became a standard tool in quantum field theory  @xcite and statistical physics  @xcite , often providing the easiest route to derivation of perturbative expansions and serving as an excellent framework for ( both numerical and analytical ) non - perturbative analysis  @xcite .",
    "feynman pi has its counterpart in pure mathematics , namely , in the theory of continuous - time stochastic processes  @xcite . there",
    "the concept of integration over a space of continuous functions ( so - called fluctuating paths or sample paths ) had been introduced by wiener  @xcite already in 1920 s in order to represent and quantify the brownian motion .",
    "interestingly enough , this so - called wiener integral ( or integral with respect to wiener measure ) was formulated 2 years before the discovery of the schrdinger equation and 25 years before feynman s pi formulation .",
    "the _ local time _ for a brownian particle ( in some literature also called _ sojourn time _ ) has been of interest to physicists and mathematicians , since the seminal work of paul  lvy in 1930 s  @xcite . in its essence , the local time characterizes the time that a sample trajectory @xmath1 of a given stochastic process spends in the vicinity of an arbitrary point @xmath2 .",
    "this in turn defines a sample trajectory @xmath3 of a new stochastic process .",
    "a rich theory has been developed for local - time processes that stem from diffusion processes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and citations therein ) . for later convenience",
    ", we should particularly highlight the ray  knight theorem which states that the local time of the wiener process can be expressed in terms of the squared bessel process  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to mathematics , the concept of the local time is not uniquely settled in physics literature .",
    "various authors define essentially the same quantity under different names ( local time , occupation time , traversal time , etc . ) , and with different applications in mind . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the _ traversal time _",
    "is used to study quantum scattering and tunneling processes , in  @xcite the small - temperature behavior of the equilibrium density matrix is analyzed with a help of the _ occupation time _ , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the large - time behavior of path integrals that contain functionals of the _ local time _",
    "is discussed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a local - time pi representation of the bloch density matrix , i.e. , the matrix elements @xmath4 of the gibbs operator .",
    "this can serve not only as a viable alternative to the commonly used feynman ",
    "kac representation but also as a powerful tool for extracting both large and small - temperature behavior .",
    "apart from the general theoretical outline , our primary focus here will be on the low - temperature behavior which is technically more challenging than the large - temperature regime .",
    "in fact , the large - temperature expansion was already treated in some detail in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , we also wish to promote the concept of the local time which is not yet sufficiently well known among the path - integral practitioners .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . to set the stage we recall in the next section some fundamentals from the feynman pi which will be needed in later sections . in section",
    "[ sec : heuristic ] we provide motivation for the introduction of a local time , and construct a heuristic version of the local - time representation of pi s . the key technical part of the article is contained in section  [ sec : lt ] , where we derive by means of the replica trick the local - time representation of the bloch density matrix .",
    "relation to the sturm ",
    "liouville theory is also highlighted in this context .",
    "a local - time analog of the feynman ",
    "salam formula  @xcite is presented in section  [ sec : functionals ] and its usage is illustrated with a computation of the one - point distribution of the local time . since a natural arena for local - time pi s is in thermally extremal regimes , we confine our attention in section  [ sec : asymp ] on large- and small-@xmath5 asymptotic behavior of the bloch density matrix . there",
    "we also derive an explicit leading - order behavior in large-@xmath5 ( i.e. , low - temperature ) expansion .",
    "the analysis is substantially streamlined by using the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational principle .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our results and discusses possible extensions , applications , and future developments of the present work . for the reader s",
    "convenience the paper is supplemented with appendix which clarifies some finer technical details .",
    "consider a non - relativistic one - dimensional quantum - mechanical system described by a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 . throughout this paper",
    "we will study the matrix elements @xmath8 of the gibbs operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the inverse temperature and @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 , known also as the bloch density matrix , is a fundamental object in quantum statistical physics , as the expectation value of an operator @xmath13 at the temperature @xmath14 can be written in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the partition function of the system . in case of need ,",
    "ensuing quantum mechanical transition amplitudes can be obtained from ( [ rhodef ] ) via a wick rotation which formally amounts to the substitution @xmath17 , converting thus the gibbs operator @xmath9 to the quantum evolution operator @xmath18 .",

    "the integrand in @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 , can be identified with the classical hamiltonian function , in which the momentum @xmath28 is substituted for @xmath29 .",
    "one can also regard ( [ pix ] ) as an expectation value of the functional @xmath30 $ ] over the ( driftless ) brownian motion with the diffusion coefficient @xmath31 , and duration @xmath32 , that starts at point @xmath33 , and terminates at @xmath34 .",
    "the latter stochastic process is also known as brownian bridge .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold .",
    "firstly , we would like to motivate a need for reformulation of pi s in the language of local - time stochastic process .",
    "in particular , we point out when such a reformulation can be more pertinent than the conventional `` sum over histories '' prescription .",
    "secondly , we wish to outline a heuristic construction of the local - time representation of pi s .",
    "more rigorous and explicit ( but less intuitive ) formulation of pi s over ensemble of local times will be presented in the subsequent section .    to provide a physically sound motivation for the local - time representation of pi s",
    "we follow exposition of paulin _",
    ".  @xcite . to this end",
    "we first consider the diagonal elements of the bloch density matrix , i.e. , @xmath35 ( often referred to as the boltzmann density ) . upon",
    "shifting @xmath36 , and setting @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the thermal de  broglie wavelength ) , the pi ( [ pix ] ) can be reformulated in terms of dimensionless quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] note in particular , that in contrast to @xmath43 the measure @xmath44 does not explicitly depend on @xmath5 , and thus @xmath5-dependent parts in the pi are under better control .",
    "such a rescaled representation is particularly useful when discussing large- and/or small-@xmath5 behavior of the path integral in question .",
    "path fluctuations in the potential are controlled by @xmath45 , and the factor @xmath5 quantifies the significance of the potential @xmath46 with respect to the kinetic term .    for small @xmath5 ( i.e. , high temperature ) , typical paths @xmath47 stay in the vicinity of the point @xmath33 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] ,     are plotted as functions of the dimensionless time @xmath40 .",
    "the solid green path , representing a typical trajectory with a high value of @xmath5 , exhibits large fluctuations , whereas the dashed red path , corresponding to small @xmath5 , stays in the vicinity of the initial and final point @xmath33 . on the right ,",
    "two local - time profiles @xmath48 are shown .",
    "the broad one ( solid green ) arises from the violently fluctuating path @xmath49 , whereas the narrow one ( dashed red ) corresponds to the path with small fluctuations . on the left",

    "when @xmath5 is large ( i.e. , low temperature ) , the trajectories @xmath49 fluctuate heavily around the value @xmath33 , and the potential term @xmath46 dominates over the kinetic one . from the statistical physics point of view , the most important contribution to the low temperature behavior of the path integral ( [ pixresc ] ) should come from those paths that spend a sizable amount of time near the _ global _ minimum of the potential @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , it is important to be able to keep track of the time which a given path spends in an infinitesimal neighborhood of an arbitrary point @xmath0 .",
