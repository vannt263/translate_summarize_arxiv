    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the short time of their activity , they outshine all other sources in the sky in gamma rays .",
    "these energetic explosions originate from cataclysmic cosmic events , whose  inner engine \" that drives the observed emission is confined to volumes mere tens of kilometers across , as indicated by the duration and variability of gamma - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this inner engine is hidden from direct electromagnetic observations , even though the variability of the emission is directly related to the engine s activity .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) , on the other hand , carry information directly from the inner engine to the observer .    with the near completion of advanced gw detectors",
    "@xcite , we will soon be able to directly probe the dynamical processes leading to the creation of grbs , which are less ( or not ) accessible via other messengers . the advanced ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite detectors",
    "are planned to begin observation in 2015 , albeit initially below design sensitivity , gradually reaching their design sensitivity around the end of the decade @xcite . upon reaching their design sensitivity ,",
    "the advanced ligo and virgo detectors are expected to be about 10 times more sensitive ( at their most sensitive frequency band around @xmath0hz ) than the initial ligo / virgo detectors .",
    "further , advanced detectors will have a wider sensitive frequency band , reaching down to @xmath1hz .",
    "this will improve their sensitivity to wide - band sources such as compact binaries .",
    "the global gw detector network will further increase its reach in both distance and source direction reconstruction by the addition of further detectors @xcite , such as the japanese kagra ( formerly lcgt ; @xcite ) detector that is under construction , as well as the planned third ligo observatory in india @xcite .",
    "there are a number of mechanisms conjectured to result in a grb .",
    "potential mechanisms include the formation of a central object surrounded by an accretion disk from the merger of binary neutron stars @xcite or a neutron star and a low - mass black hole @xcite , the collapse of the core of a massive star @xcite , the global reconfiguration of the magnetic fields in magnetized neutron stars @xcite , the accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs following accretion from a non - degenerate companion @xcite or following the merger of a white dwarf binary @xcite , or even cosmic strings @xcite . identifying the mechanisms behind the creation of individual grbs will be greatly aided by gw detections .",
    "this review intends to survey the prospects of gw measurements in understanding the central engines of grbs . while our theoretical view of gw emission mechanisms connected to grbs is rapidly evolving , the main directions , the opportunities and limitations of observational gw astrophysics are becoming clearer . with this review",
    "we aim to provide guidance to ( i ) astronomers interested in utilizing the capabilities of gw measurements to complement electromagnetic or neutrino observations in understanding grbs , and ( ii ) gw scientists interested in the open questions in grb astrophysics that can be addressed through gw measurements .",
    "compact binary mergers , the likely progenitors of most short grbs ( e.g. , @xcite , although see @xcite for alternative models ) , are one of the primary targets of gw searches ( e.g. , @xcite ) . advanced gw detectors will be able to , among others , measure the properties of the binary @xcite , directly probe the dynamics of the central engine , and correlate the binary s masses and orientation with prompt and delayed electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "these observations will constrain the central engine mechanism , provide standard sirens for measuring cosmological parameters @xcite , and constrain the nature of nuclear matter ( see section [ section : cbcphysics ] ) .",
    "gw emission from isolated central engines , such as stellar core collapses , accretion induced collapses or magnetars , is typically at higher frequencies and at lower amplitudes than for compact binaries .",
    "gw emission depends on the development of varying quadrupole moment , which is highly source and model dependent .",
    "the detection of gws from isolated objects would help us understand the internal processes in massive stellar collapses , including the development of differentially rotating protoneutron stars , the nature of nuclear matter , or the creation of massive accretion disks ( sections [ section : collapsarphysics ] , [ section : magnetarphysics ] & [ section : millisecondmagnetars ] ) .    for many topics touched upon here",

    "some investigations of isotropic prompt and delayed electromagnetic counterparts have recently been summarized in @xcite ( for short grbs ) .",
    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : emissionprocesses ] outlines gw emission processes from grb progenitors , focusing on the emission scenarios that may produce signals which could be detectable with advanced gw detectors .",
    "section [ section : astrophysics ] presents some of the intriguing astrophysical questions that could be answered through the detection of gws from grb progenitors , in some cases in coincidence with other messengers . in section [ section : observationalstrategies ] we review gw observation strategies from single gw to multimessenger searches , also outlining prospects for the advanced detector era .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusion ] we briefly summarizes the presented results and the near future of grb astrophysics with gws .",
    "in this section , we outline the main grb progenitor models with an emphasis on their expected gw signature",
    ". it should be clear that , depending on the progenitor model , the gw emission from grb progenitors varies widely with respect to predicted signal strength and characteristic frequency .      the majority of short - hard grbs are thought to be powered by the merger of ns - ns or ns - bh binaries  @xcite .",
    "compact binaries are also strong gw sources : the gws produced in the minutes before the merger should be detectable , by second generation instruments ( i.e. , advanced ligo and virgo ) , reliably out to @xmath2mpc for ns - ns binaries , and further for ns - bh systems @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies provide detailed information about the binary evolution and the gravitational waveform expected from these systems .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations , which include the physics of the ns matter , continue to improve ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . here",
    "we present an overview of compact binary evolution , which is summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : cbcflowchart ] . at the highest level , there can be four phases : the inspiral phase during which the orbit shrinks due to energy and angular momentum loss via gws ; the merger phase during which dynamical effects and microphysics of the ns become important ; the accretion phase when material stripped from the ns(s ) accretes onto the merged objects ; and the ringdown phase when the merged objects settle down to an unperturbed ( kerr ) bh or a ns .",
    "the details vary by ns - ns and ns - bh merger and by mass ( and other parameters ) of the merging objects .",
    "the accretion stage is likely essential to the formation of short grbs from binary coalescences , although the formation and evolution of protomagnetars following ns - ns merger has also been proposed as a plausible central engine @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : cbcspectrum ] presents the main features of gw emission in a schematic spectrum of the gw effective amplitude , separately for ns - ns and bh - ns mergers .",
    "below we discuss the different stages of the evolution in more detail .",
    " early in the evolution of a compact binary system , the two objects are separated by a relatively large distance compared to their radii .",
    "the binary elements spiral towards each other by losing angular momentum via the emission of gws . during the early stages of the inspiral",
    ", the two compact objects can be approximated as point masses for the purposes of gw emission  @xcite . at the late stages of the inspiral ,",
    "the internal structure of the objects become increasingly important . for example , the tidal deformation of nss in a binary system can ( slightly ) affect the orbital period ( and therefore the gravitational waveform ) in the late inspiral phase @xcite .",
    "further , general relativistic spin - spin or spin - orbit coupling can cause the binary s orbital plane to precess , affecting the binary s evolution and gw emission @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant features of the gw signal from the inspiral phase are captured by neglecting the spins and internal structure of the binary elements . as the objects spiral together , their orbital frequency increases producing a gw signal that sweeps upward in frequency .",
    "about @xmath3 minutes before merger , the gw from the inspiral of a ns - ns binary begins to sweep upward from @xmath1hz through the band of earth - based gw interferometers . the effective amplitude @xmath4 of the gw signal from a binary system decreases as @xmath5 @xcite , up to a mass - dependent cutoff frequency @xmath6khz @xcite .",
    "the frequency ranges @xmath7khz and @xmath8khz are traditionally considered the inspiral and early merger phases , respectively . for @xmath9",
    "the merger retains a binary - like structure and consequently emits relatively strong gws @xcite .",
    "advanced detectors will be able to detect a ns - ns inspiral up to @xmath10mpc , while ns - bh inspirals will be detectable up to @xmath11mpc  @xcite ( the distances are given for untriggered searches , with optimal source orientation and direction ; for further details see section [ section : allsky ] ) .",

    "third generation detectors are expected to reach an order of magnitude farther than advanced detectors , i.e. to several gpc , and hence will be able to observe tens of thousands of events a year ( e.g. , @xcite ) .       depending on the binary system , the merger can progress in multiple distinct directions with qualitatively different gw and gamma - ray emission .",
    "the formation of a massive accretion disk is probably crucial to the generation of a grb from binary mergers @xcite .",
    "accretion disks can be created via the tidal disruption of a ns at some point during the merger @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for ns - ns mergers , material with centrifugal support can be left outside the newly formed bh . whether an accretion disk is formed or not depends on the binary properties ( mass , spin , etc . ) , as well as the ns equation of state ( eos ) . a disk mass of @xmath13m@xmath14 , where m@xmath14 is",

    "we also discussed some of the major scientific questions that could be addressed upon the detection of gws from these sources .",
    "second generation gw observatories , commencing their operation in the next few years ( e.g. , @xcite ) , will be sensitive enough to reach distances for which the detection of gw signals from grb progenitors becomes possible .",
    "the gw signal expected from compact binary coalescences , the likely progenitors of short grbs , is fairly well understood as a function of the ( often unknown ) source properties .",
    "the detection of gws can provide estimates or constraints on these source properties .",
    "we presented a detailed overview of the questions that can be addressed about short - grb progenitors upon the detection of their gw signature .",
    "the core - collapse of massive stars , the likely progenitor of long grbs , has less constrained theoretical gw emission models .",
    "this is partly due to the lack of our detailed understanding of the progenitor ( e.g. , how cores maintain their high rotation rate prior to collapse ) , and partly due to the complex dynamics of the collapsing core and the resulting compact object ( protoneutron star or black hole ) and accretion disk , whose understanding requires further theoretical and numerical studies .",
    "nevertheless , the core - collapse dynamics may lead to gw signals that are detectable on distance scales comparable to the lower end of the long - grb distance scale ( @xmath156mpc ) .",
    "for example rotational instabilities in differentially rotating protoneutron - stars , as well as global instabilities in tori around black holes , both lead to rotating , non - axisymmetric systems with potentially strong gw emission .",
    "starquakes in highly - magnetized neutron stars , likely responsible for producing a fraction of short grbs , result in seismic oscillations in the neutron star , which in turn may produce gws detectable with second generation gw observatories .",
    "the detection ( or non - detection ) of such gws coincident with the flaring activity of neutron stars can be informative , e.g. , on the properties of matter at nuclear densities , as well as on the properties of astrophysical neutron stars .",
