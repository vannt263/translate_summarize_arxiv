    "as the doping decreases , voltage windows where current self - oscillations are possible open up .",
    "@xcite these windows may coalesce into a single one as doping is further lowered , and oscillations disappear below a critical doping value . since doping is not a feasible control parameter , other quantities affecting carrier density should be used to observe these behaviors .",
    "feasible control parameters are laser illumination in undoped sls  @xcite ( which behaves qualitatively as well doping ) , transverse magnetic fields ,  @xcite and temperature  @xcite in doped sls .    despite its practical and theoretical interest ,",
    "the effect of temperature on electric field domains  @xcite and current self - oscillations is still poorly understood .",
    "early numerical calculations were performed with a fixed drift velocity corresponding to a fixed temperature .  @xcite using the insight provided by these calculations and reasonable expectations on how drift velocity depends with temperature , the fact that oscillatory voltage windows widen as the temperature increases was explained .",
    "@xcite more detailed experimental studies dealing with the influence of temperature on self - oscillations have appeared recently .",
    "@xcite experimental data show that raising the temperature is similar to lowering the sl doping . at low temperature",
    "a multiplicity of purely static states ( corresponding to coexistence of low and high field domains in the sl ) was observed . as the temperature increased , voltage windows corresponding to self - oscillations appeared and widened in the sl @xmath0@xmath1 characteristics .",
    "@xcite experimental data were interpreted by using the discrete drift model  @xcite with a fitted drift velocity .",
    "@xcite these authors concluded that the peak - to - valley ratio in the negative differential mobility region of the drift velocity was crucial to understand the data .",
    "a model including both variation of the electron density in the wells and variation of the drift velocity with temperature was therefore needed .",

    "furthermore , our numerical results ( based upon microscopically calculated drift velocities ) agree with the available experimental data and explain them quantitatively .",
    "we explain qualitatively why regions of stationary states alternate with regions of self - oscillations in the temperature  voltage phase diagram .",
    "finally and on the basis of our numerical simulations , we also explain why the frequency may have local maxima in the voltage intervals where self - oscillations occur . that the frequency may increase with voltage , while the average current simultaneously decreases is thus a consequence of our theory , not an anomaly .",
    "@xcite    the rest of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec - model ] contains a brief description of the ddd model and a calculation of its transport coefficients and boundary conditions appropriate for wang et al s experimental sample .",
    "results of numerical simulations of this model and comparison with experimental data are reported in section [ sec - results ] .",
    "section [ sec - conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "a discussion of the qualitative theoretical analysis included in the experimental papers is presented in appendix [ sec - crap ] .",
    "the main charge transport mechanism in a weakly coupled sl is sequential resonant tunneling .",
    "the characteristics of the samples experimentally studied in ref .",
    "are such that the macroscopic time scale of the self - sustained oscillations is larger than the tunneling time ( defined as the time an electron needs to advance from one well to the next one ) . in turn , this latter time is much larger than the intersubband scattering time .",
    "then tunneling across a barrier is a stationary process with well - defined fermi - dirac distributions at each well .",
    "these distributions depend on the instantaneous values of the electron density and potential drops and vary only on the longer macroscopic time scale .",
    "the tunneling current density across each barrier in the sl may be approximately calculated by means of the transfer hamiltonian method .",
    "@xcite the resulting formulas can be used to calculate the transport coefficients and boundary conditions of the following ddd model :  @xcite @xmath2 in these equations , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are well permittivity , minus the electron charge and 2d doping in the wells , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the sl period , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the widths of barriers and wells , respectively .",
    "eq.([m1 ] ) is ampre s law establishig that the total current density , @xmath9 , is sum of displacement and tunneling currents .",
    "the latter consists of a drift term , @xmath10 , and a diffusion term , @xmath11 . we have adopted the convention ( usual in this field ) that the current density has the same direction as the flow of electrons .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) holds for @xmath12 .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) is the poisson equation , and it holds for @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the 2d electron number density at well @xmath15 , which is singularly concentrated on a plane located at the end of the well .",
    "@xmath16 is _ minus _ an average electric field on a sl period comprising the @xmath15th well and the @xmath15th barrier ( well @xmath15 lies between barriers @xmath17 and @xmath15 : barriers 0 and @xmath18 separate the sl from the emitter and collector contact regions , respectively ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts the field - dependent drift velocity at different temperatures for sl parameter values of ref .  :",

    "it has been calculated from the microscopic tunneling current density by the procedure explained in ref .  .",
    "the only adjustable parameter in the sequential tunneling formulas is the lorentzian half - width of the scattering amplitudes , @xmath21 . to estimate them",
    ", we have considered that the voltage difference , @xmath22 , between the peaks of two consecutive branches on the second plateau of the static @xmath0@xmath1 characteristic is @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the @xmath15th energy level of a given well . for @xmath25 , the field profile on",

    "the domain walls corresponding to two adjacent branches in the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram are located in adjacent wells .",
    "then the voltage difference should be @xmath28 . in the presence of scattering , resonant peaks have finite widths which we take as @xmath29 , thereby obtaining ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "@xmath30 is an adjustable parameter of the order of unity  @xcite . by using this formula and the measured current in ref .",
    "( figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 )",
    ", we find @xmath31  mev at 1.6  k and @xmath32  mev at 140  k for @xmath33 .",
    "linear interpolation yields the temperature dependence of @xmath21 in the range we are interested in .",
    "notice that the first peak of the velocity in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] rapidly disappears as the temperature increases for this particular sample .",
    "this result might change if we assume different scattering amplitudes for each of the two first subbands of the wells .",
    "moreover , the different extrema of the velocity curve shift to lower field values as the temperature increases .",
    "thus formation of electric field domains and current self - oscillations are expected for voltages on the second plateau and higher .",
    "multistable solution branches of the current  voltage characteristic curve should also shift to lower voltages and higher currents as the temperature increases , as observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite these effects could not be obtained from the fitted drift velocity in ref .  .",
    "as the diffusion coefficient decreases very rapidly with field , we can safely set @xmath34 in our ddd model for the experimentally observed voltage range .",
    "the relevant model is thus the well - known discrete drift model of refs .   with the drift velocity deduced from a microscopic calculation of the current plus boundary conditions @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    to complete the description of our model , we need to specify initial , boundary and bias conditions .",
    "the dc voltage bias condition is @xmath35 given that @xmath36 , we need only one boundary condition specifying @xmath37 ( the field at the contact region ) .",
    "we will assume that there is an excess electron density in the first well due to tunneling from the highly doped contact region ,  @xcite @xmath38 for an appropriately chosen dimensionless positive constant @xmath39 , this condition selects recycling of charge monopole waves as the mechanism for self - sustained oscillations of the current .",
    "@xcite the same behavior can be obtained from more elaborated boundary condition for the microscopic tuneling current between the emitter and the neighboring well  @xcite provided contact doping is sufficiently high ( ohmic behavior ) .",
    "given the uncertainties inherent to contact specification , we have preferred to use the phenomenological boundary condition ( [ m4 ] ) instead .",
    "in this section , we shall numerically simulate the discrete drift model for different values of temperature . from formula ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "considering d=0 : @xmath40   = j(t)\\ , , \\label{n1}\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n f_{i } = { v\\over { \\cal l}}\\ , . \\label{n2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding drift curves are chosen among those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the boundary condition will be ( [ m4 ] ) with @xmath41 .",
    "a first interesting conclusion can be drawn effortlessly from an analytical upper bound of the critical doping above which there are stable static electric field domain branches :  @xcite @xmath42 in this formula , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the values of the electric field which correspond to the maximum and minimum of the drift velocity ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) on the second plateau .",
    "the temperature dependence of this critical doping is plotted in fig .",
    "we observe that the critical doping increases with temperature , indicating that the voltage range for which self - oscillations exist increases as temperature does . in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] predicts a transition temperature at around 93  k whereas about 140  k is experimentally measured .",
    "@xcite despite the fact that the bound ( [ bound ] ) is only a rough approximation , the agreement is rather good .",
    "we shall see below that the agreement improves when complete simulations of the ddd model are carried out .",
    "results of our simulations are presented in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , corresponding to a 40-well sl with @xmath47  nm , @xmath48  nm , and @xmath49@xmath20 . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the time averaged current ",
    "voltage characteristics of such a sl for temperatures ranging from 110 to 150 k. in this temperature range , there are voltage intervals ( with a flat form ) in which the sl current is stationary interspersed in voltage intervals of current self - oscillations corresponding to recycling of charge monopoles .",
    "this agrees with experimental results reported by wang et al .",
    "@xcite for temperatures lower than 110 k or higher than 250 k , the ranges of self - oscillations disappear .",
    "these figures are similar to those reported in li et al s experiments .",
    "@xcite    we observe that the @xmath0@xmath1 curve presents intervals in which the average current increases with voltage , followed by intervals in which the average current decreases . at lower temperatures",
    "the intervals of increasing current are wider whereas the opposite occurs at higher temperatures .",
    "correspondingly , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the frequency of the self - oscillations as a function of voltage .",
    "the frequency of the self - oscillations in such an interval starts increasing but it drops to a smaller value than the initial one at the upper limit of the interval .",
    "the amplitude of the self - oscillations ( not shown here ) vanishes at the upper and lower limits of each voltage interval .",
    "this suggests that the branches of self - oscillations begin and end at supercritical hopf bifurcations . as the temperature increases , the region of negative differential mobility in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is smoother and the frequency of the self - oscillations increases ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) . in the opposite temperature range , at low temperatures , the electric field profiles consist of basically two stationary domains joined by a domain wall .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 characteristic curve has multiple branches corresponding to stationary domains with the domain wall located at different wells .",
    "this situation resembles that obtained as voltage and doping are varied , provided doping and reciprocal of temperature are assimilated . in ref .   the phase diagram doping ",
    "voltage of a doped sl was calculated . at low doping ( high temperature )",
    ", the electric field inside the sl is almost homogeneous and stationary . above a critical value ,",
    "branches of self - oscillations appear . in this region , there are voltage intervals of stationary electric field profiles separated by intervals of self - oscillations .",
    "the latter arise and disappear ( typically ) as hopf bifurcations from stationary states . above a certain doping ( low temperature ) , the intervals of self - oscillations vanish and only stationary states ( consisting of two electric field domains separated by a domain wall ) remain . notice in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that there are voltage intervals where the oscillation frequency increases with voltage , while the average current decreases with voltage .",
    "this behavior was dubbed _",
    "anomalous _ by wang et al ,  @xcite although it is conveniently explained by the discrete drift model equations as shown by our present simulations .",
    "a qualitative explanation of this behavior follows .",
    "first of all , it can be observed in the simulations that the maximum current during one oscillation period does not vary too much , while the minimum current drops precipituously with voltage ; see the insets in fig .",
    "this rapid drop of the minimum current and the approximate invariance of the maximum current can be understood from an asymptotic analysis :  @xcite the current approximately follows part of the velocity curve , @xmath50 , during the motion of a monopole .",
    "the monopole is created when the current surpasses the maximum value @xmath51 .",
    "then the current decreases with time until either the monopole exits at the receiving contact or the minimum value @xmath52 is reached .",
    "the first possibility is attained at low voltages , the second one at high voltages .",
    "the current oscillation starts with zero amplitude at the lower end of a voltage interval , so that the current does not depart too much from its maximum value .",
    "as the voltage increases , the minima of the current at each oscillation period decrease . what about the dependence of frequency with voltage",
    "? it can be shown  @xcite that the oscillation period @xmath53 may be estimated from the following formula : @xmath54 here @xmath55 is such that @xmath56 represents the number of wells traversed by the charge monopole during one oscillation period , @xmath57 is its average velocity and @xmath58 is the monopole formation time ( which is an increasing function of @xmath55  @xcite ) .",
    "now , @xmath55 decreases with voltage owing to the dc bias condition ,  @xcite so that the number of wells traversed by a monopole grows as the voltage increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this means that the first term in ( [ eqperiod ] ) decreases with voltage and the second one increases with voltage ( it becomes _ less negative _ ) .",
    "thus there is a competition between these two mechanisms : the first tries to make the oscillation period decrease with voltage ( therefore the oscillation frequency increases with voltage ) , while the second term has the opposite effect . near the lowest voltage of an interval",
    "for which there are oscillations , @xmath59 , and the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eqperiod ] ) dominates . as the voltage increases , the oscillation amplitude increases and @xmath57 decreases , so that the second term becomes more important",
    "of course whether the maximum of the frequency is reached immediately or not can not be said from our rough argument .",
    "still , the results of our simulations show conclusively that the oscillation frequency may reach a single maximum at voltage intervals where the current oscillates .",
    "starting from a microscopic sequential tunneling model of transport in weakly coupled sl , we have derived the field - dependent drift velocity for a doped 14/4 sl at temperatures ranging from 0 to 175k .",
    "we found that the first plateau rapidly disappears as the temperature increases , and therefore we can set the diffusivity to zero in our ddd model to study the second plateau .",
    "our numerical simulations show that stable solutions change from stationary field profiles with two coexisting electric field domains at low temperature to recycling moving monopoles giving rise to current self - oscillations at higher temperature .",
    "voltage windows in the @xmath0@xmath1 diagram appear and widen as temperature increases .",
    "we observe as well an intrincate behavior of the oscillation frequency as a function of the dc voltage for different temperatures .",
    "these findings agree with and explain the experimental data reported by wang et al .",

    "theoretical interpretation of experimental results in refs .   is based upon a model proposed earlier by x .-",
    "wang and q.  niu ( wn ) .",
    "@xcite their model is mathematically analogous to an earlier model of laikhtman .",

    "the function @xmath68 is in fact a piecewise linear n - shaped function common for all wells , @xmath69 ; see fig.3 of ref .  .",
    "before commenting on this model , it is convenient to simplify it by eliminating the charge densities , @xmath62 .",
    "notice that ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) imply the usual ampre s law @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the total current .",

    "the current @xmath76 can be eliminated by adding all equations ( [ c4 ] ) and using that the bias ( [ c3 ] ) is independent of time .",

    "( [ c5 ] ) is reminiscent of the problem of synchronization of coupled oscillators of zero frequency at zero temperature with the total current playing the role of order ,  @xcite parameter .",
    "the oscillators @xmath74 try to achieve a stationary state such that @xmath78 , given appropriate properties of the functions @xmath79 ( positive differential conductivity , @xmath80 ) .",
    "@xcite      the main physical objection to the wn model is that the sequential tunneling current across a barrier , @xmath79 , depends explicitly on the electron densities at adjacent wells , as well as on electrostatic potentials .",
    "this is made patent by microscopic derivations ,  @xcite which are conspicuously absent in wn s paper .",
    "one unphysical consequence is that wn s results do not depend explicitly on well doping [ except that @xmath63 might change in some unspecified _ ad hoc _ form with doping ] .",
    "however , experiments and theory show that stable static electric field domains are formed at large doping , whereas self - sustained current oscillations appear for carrier densities below a critical value .",
    "@xcite similarly , doping at the injecting contact ( ignored in the wn model ) selects the type of charge density wave ( monopoles or dipoles ) responsible for current self - oscillations .",
    "@xcite    wn s mathematical study of their model contains a linear stability analysis of a given unspecified stationary state and several unproven statements ( some of which are even incorrect ) .",
    "let us be specific .",
    "wn claim that all eigenvalues @xmath81 corresponding to inserting @xmath82 in the linearized equations are real , which seems reasonable .",
    "however , later on , they claim that a time periodic solution ( limit cycle ) can appear via a hopf bifurcation from a stationary state .",
    "this is an elementary error : a necessary condition of a hopf bifurcation is that a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis .",
    "the argument they use ( illustrated in their figure 2 ) to `` prove '' the existence of a limit cycle rests on unproven assumptions and , anyway , is not valid in more than two dimensions .",
    "in fact , they claim that there exists a large enough region about an unstable stationary state which is invariant under the flow , because the potential difference between two adjacent wells can not exceed the applied bias . but",
    "no one has proved that this model ( not to be confounded with physical reality ! ) posesses such desirable property .",
    "furthermore , if there is only one stationary state and it becomes unstable by changing a control parameter , it will typically do so by having one of its eigenvalues changing from negative to positive values .",
    "( recall that all eigenvalues are real ) .",
    "then the bifurcating solution will typically ( codimension one ) be stationary .",
    "thus the situation of wn s figure 2 is unrealistic : inside the attractive region depicted , there should be another stationary ( atracting ) fixed point .",
    "other more exotic possibilities are that the flow escapes to decidedly unphysical fixed points having some negative @xmath74 or that it wanders chaotically between different unstable fixed points .",
    "wang et al @xcite gave an explanation for the fact that the self - oscillation frequency may increase with increasing bias while , at the same time , the mean current decreases .",
    "this allegedly anomalous behavior has been explained by means of the discrete drift model in section [ sec - results ] . on the other hand , wang et al s explanations of the `` anomaly '' are based on the claim that equations ( [ c4 ] ) with _ constant _ total current @xmath76 can have a limit cycle .",
    "they also give an estimate of its frequency .",
    "these arguments are clearly erroneous . in fact , all equations in ( [ c4 ] ) are uncoupled if @xmath76 is a constant . then ( [ c4 ] ) is a one - dimensional autonomous dynamical system , which can not have limit cycles among its solutions .",
