    "interactions between atoms may be controlled via magnetic , optical or microwave feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "the change in the depth of the optical lattice modifies primarily the tunneling between lattice sites ( having also effect on the effective interaction strength ) enabling e.g. the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition in the optical realization of the bose - hubbard model as proposed by jaksch and zoller @xcite and subsequently demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another spectacular way of controlling the tunneling has been proposed by eckardt , weiss and holthaus @xcite .",
    "fast periodic modulations of the optical lattice allow for an effective , time - averaged tunneling to be totally suppressed keeping the depth of the lattice potential unchanged . by varying the strength of the modulation one can induce the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition @xcite as verified experimentally a few years later @xcite .",
    "importantly , not only the magnitude , but also the sign of the tunneling amplitudes can be altered using this approach .",
    "this concept has been utilized in a recent proposition to create frustrated magnetism with cold bosons in a triangular lattice @xcite later implemented in fascinating experiments of the hamburg group @xcite .",
    "the effective tunneling caused by periodic lattice modulations is adequately explained in the framework of the floquet theory @xcite for the periodically time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "the properties of the corresponding quasi - energies spectra are known to depend on the global symmetries of the hamiltonian @xcite . employing the similar idea",
    "we demonstrate that periodic perturbations that break the time - reversal invariance ( tri ) can change not only the sign of the tunneling amplitudes , but may also induce their complex values .    in the following , we concentrate on superfluid fermions in the bardeen - cooper - schriffer ( bcs ) regime with broken tri .",
    "we show that typically a pairing function for @xmath0-wave interactions acquires a complex phase which may be controlled by the tri breaking mechanism considered in the present paper ( for a discussion of @xmath1-wave orbitals see @xcite ) .",
    "we also point out that in the bose - fermi mixture with broken tri the complex ground state of bosons affects the fermi pairing function .",
    "the effect is reminiscent of the disorder induced phase control in such mixtures as discussed by one of us recently @xcite . in our case",
    "the phase control is not due to a disorder , but due to a control over the tunneling mechanism and the tri breaking .",
    "let us begin , for simplicity , with a single particle in an one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice potential driven by a double harmonic perturbation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads h_0=+v(x)+k_1x(t)+k_2x(2t+ ) , [ 1p ] where @xmath2 is an optical lattice potential with the lattice constant @xmath3 , @xmath4 stand for strengths of the driving at a basic frequency @xmath5 and its second harmonic , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian is time - periodic , i.e. @xmath6 , and the floquet theorem @xcite guarantees that so called the floquet hamiltonian : = h_0-i_t is diagonalized by periodic functions .",
    "eigenvalues of the @xmath7 are referred to quasi - energies of the system analogous to quasi - momenta in a solid state physics .",
    "they are defined modulo @xmath8 and it is sufficient to consider a single floquet zone ( an analog of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "periodic eigenfunctions of the floquet hamiltonian can be expanded in a fourier series , i.e. in a basis where time @xmath9 can be considered as an additional _ degree of freedom_. let us define basis vectors _ j , m(x , t)&=&\\{-ix } & & & & ( imt)w_j(x ) , [ basis ] which fulfill _ j,m|_j ,",

    "( [ basis ] ) corresponds to the unitary transformation which allows us to switch from the length gauge to the velocity gauge using quantum optics language .",
    "the matrix of the floquet hamiltonian consists of diagonal @xmath10-blocks in the basis ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "the blocks are very weakly coupled among themselves provided the driving frequency @xmath5 is very high . using the tight - binding approximation and taking into an account nearest neighbor tunneling only the diagonal blocks become _ j,m|h|_j , m&=&-j_eff_j,j+1-j^*_eff_j,j-1 & & & & + ( m+e_0)_j,j , where @xmath13 and the effective tunneling amplitude j_eff = j_k=-^j_2k(s_1)j_k(s_2)e^ik , [ jeff ] where s_i= , [ si ] are dimensionless strengths of the first ( @xmath14 ) and the second ( @xmath15 ) harmonic , the bare tunneling amplitude is @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the ordinary bessel function . if @xmath18 the description of a single particle system may be restricted to a single diagonal block h_eff=_j,0|h|_j,0=-j_eff_j,j+1-j^*_eff_j,j-1 , [ heff ] where the constant term @xmath19 has been omitted .    if there is only one harmonic present in ( [ 1p ] ) or the phase @xmath20 , the floquet hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant and @xmath7 is represented by a real symmetric matrix in a generic basis @xcite .",
    "then , the effective tunneling amplitude ( [ jeff ] ) is real .",
    "single harmonic driving has been used to change the interaction from ferromagnetic ( positive @xmath21 ) to antiferromagnetic ( negative @xmath21 ) and to realize frustrated magnetic phases @xcite . by breaking tri",
    "we are able to realize nearly arbitrary complex values of the tunneling amplitude @xmath22 . in fig .",

    "we have concentrated on a 1d problem . however",
