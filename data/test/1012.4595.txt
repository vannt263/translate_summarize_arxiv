    "the einstein - vlasov system with bianchi symmetry is a system of integro - differential equations on a lorentzian manifold @xmath0 which has the structure @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an interval and @xmath3 a lie group .",
    "it can be seen as a kind of transport equation , say @xmath4 , coupled to other ordinary differential equations .",
    "there exists certain limiting process such that the transport equation is transformed into an ordinary differential equation .",
    "this happens if the function @xmath5 becomes a distribution .",
    "the resulting system is called einstein - dust system and the late - time behavior is well understood .",
    "it has been studied by the theory of dynamical systems and for almost all lie groups the @xmath6-limit set is known @xcite .",
    "the strategy to study the late - time behaviour of the einstein - vlasov system consists in trying to show that the late - time behavior is well approximated by the einstein - dust system .",
    "physically this makes sense since one might expect a decay of the velocity dispersion for expanding cosmological models .",
    "the result presented in the following shows that this is true for case of the lie group @xmath7 and assuming that one is close to the unique stationary solution which is the attractor of the einstein - dust system .",
    "a bianchi spacetime is defined to be a spatially homogeneous spacetime whose isometry group possesses a three - dimensional subgroup @xmath3 that acts simply transitively on the spacelike orbits .",
    "they can be classified by the structure constants of the lie algebra associated to the lie group .",
    "we will only consider the simplest case where the structure constants vanish , i.e. the case of bianchi i where the metric has the following form using gauss coordinates : @xmath8 in terms of coordinate expressions @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy density , matter current and energy momentum tensor respectively .",
    "using the 3 + 1 decomposition of the einstein equations as made in @xcite the basic equations are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the second fundamental form , @xmath15 its trace and a dot above a letter denotes a derivative with respect to the cosmological ( gaussian ) time @xmath16 .",
    "it has been assumed that the cosmological constant vanishes .      for the matter model we will take the point of view of kinetic theory .",
    "this means that we have a collection of particles ( in a cosmological context the particles are galaxies or clusters of galaxies ) which are described statistically by a non - negative distribution function @xmath17 which is the density of particles at a given spacetime point with given four - momentum .",
    "we will assume that all the particles have equal mass ( one can relax this condition if necessary , see @xcite ) .",
    "we want that our matter model is compatible with our symmetry assumption , so we will also assume that @xmath5 does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to that we will assume that there are no collisions between the particles .",
    "in this case the distribution function satisfies the vlasov equation ( see ( 3.38 ) of @xcite ) : @xmath19 where f is defined on the set determined by the equation @xmath20 called the mass shell . for a given bianchi i geometry the vlasov equation",
    "can be solved explicitly with the result that if @xmath5 is expressed in terms of the covariant components @xmath21 then it is independent of time .",
    "the non - trivial components of the energy momentum tensor are : @xmath22 for this kind of matter all the energy conditions hold . in particular @xmath23 .",
    "our system of equations consists of the equations ( [ a])-([cu ] ) .",
    "the assumption that the spacetime is close to isotropic is expressed by assuming that the quantity @xmath24 is small .",
    "here @xmath25 denotes the trace - free part of the second fundamental form .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is related to the so called _ shear parameter _ , which is bounded by the cosmic microwave background radiation and is a dimensionless measure of the anisotropy of the universe ( see chapter 5.2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the other assumption which is needed is that the spacetime is close to `` dust - like '' .",
    "this is expressed by assuming that the absolute value of the momenta of the particles is bounded .",
    "we define @xmath27 as the supremum of the absolute value of the momenta at a given time @xmath16 : @xmath28 the main result is the following :    consider any @xmath29 solution of the einstein - vlasov system with bianchi i - symmetry and with @xmath29 initial data .",
    "assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are sufficiently small .",
    "then at late times one can make the following estimates : @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a small and strictly positive constant .",
    "these estimates imply that the spacetime isotropizes and that asymptotically there is a dust - like behaviour . the proof is based on a bootstrap argument .",
    "see @xcite for the details . using these estimates one can obtain more detailed information about the behaviour of the metric .",
    "in analogy to the kasner solution one can define the _",
    "generalized kasner exponents _ for the non - vacuum case .",
    "let @xmath34 be the eigenvalues of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath36 we define @xmath37 as the generalized kasner exponents .",
    "having analyzed carefully the dust case with small data we could conclude that :    [ t2 ] consider the same assumptions as in the previous theorem .",
    "then @xmath38 and @xmath39\\\\\\label{ll } g^{ab}=t^{-\\frac{4}{3}}[\\mathcal{g}^{ab}+o(t^{-2 } ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the result can be seen as a generalization of theorem 5.4 of @xcite .",
    "we obtain the same the result , but a ) we also obtain how fast the expressions converge b ) we obtain an asymptotic expression for the spatial metric c ) we do not assume additional symmetries .",
    "however we used a different kind of restriction namely the small data assumptions . for",
    "the study of more complicated lie groups a starting point can be @xcite - @xcite where the late - time asymptotics are obtained assuming an additional symmetry .",
    "another direction of generalization is the study of the asymptotics towards the initial singularity . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the case of two fluids has been studied which leads to the non - diagonal case . for the vlasov case already the non - lrs case has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "already in this case surprising new features like the existence of heteroclinic networks arose .",
    "finally it would be interesting concerning the direction of the initial singularity to show that also in the vlasov case the off - diagonal components of the metric tend to constants and thus are not important for the dynamics .",
    "see @xcite for the importance of this behaviour and @xcite for consequences in a quantum version .",
