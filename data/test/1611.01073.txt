    "advance in trapping and manipulating cold fermionic atoms have provided an experimental realization of various many - body phenomena  @xcite . in particular , the recent observation of fermi polarons in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) tunable fermi liquid of ultracold atoms  @xcite provides insightful understanding of quasiparticle physics in many - body systems  @xcite . the fermi polaron is a dressed spin - down impurity fermion by the surrounding scattered fermions in a spin - up fermi sea . with increasing attraction",
    ", the single spin - down fermion undergoes a possibly polaron - molecule transition in the fermionic medium in 3d .",
    "the study of quasiparticle physics and the dynamics of polarons and molecules in fermionic medium has received much theoretical and experimental attention  @xcite . in this context , all studies concerning the first order nature of the polaron - molecule transition in a 3d fermionic medium  @xcite involve variational ansatz with some approximations that is ultimately not justified in low dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to have some rigorous results of such quasiparticle physics in different mediums .",
    "@xmath0 m . for strong attraction",
    ", it binds with one spin - up fermion from the fermi sea to a tightly bound molecule ( black circle ) of two - atom with an effective mass @xmath1 @xmath22 m . ]    for 1d systems , there in general does not exhibit true quasiparticles due to strong collective nature at low temperatures .",
    "however , such a collective behavior does not rule out the existence of polarons for very few impurities immersed into the bosonic or fermionic mediums .",
    "in contrast to the fermi liquid theory for the study of the fermi polaron in 2d/3d , the exact bethe ansatz solutions are more capable of capturing microscopic origin of polarons and molecules  @xcite . in this regard , the 1d spin-1/2 delta - function interacting fermi gas  @xcite is ideal for the study of quantum impurity problem  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental physics of this model with arbitrary spin population imbalance is determined by a set of transcendental equations which were found by yang using bethe ansatz ( ba ) hypothesis in 1967  @xcite .",
    "this model shows many interesting physical properties  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the exact ba solutions can be used to study the different properties of polarons and molecules in the 1d fermi gases .    in this paper , using exact bethe ansatz ( ba ) solution , we rigorously study fermi polaron and molecule states in a 1d fermionic medium . for weak attraction ,",
    "the single spin - down impurity gets dressed by the surrounding spin - up fermions to form a polaron - like quasiparticle . however , as the attractive interaction grows , the spin - down fermion binds only one spin - up fermion from the medium to gradually form a tightly bound molecule .",
    "see a cartoon picture shown in fig .",
    "[ schemactic ] . in comparison with the previous study  @xcite , here",
    "we analytically and numerically calculate the polaron energy , the binding energy , the effective mass for this impurity problem .",
    "moreover , we obtain an explicit form of the ba wave function of the single spin - down immersed in the fully - polarized fermi sea . using this exact wave function we further calculate the distributions and the correlations of the polaron and molecule which are the major quantities for experimental measurements on these states .",
    "our result provides a microscopic origin of the polarons and molecules resulting in from quantum impurities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in secton ii , we derive explicit form of the bethe wave function . in section iii",
    ", we analytically and numerically calculate the excitation spectrum with a precise determination of the effective mass and binding energy . in section iv and v",
    "we calculate the probability distribution functions and correlation functions .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "we study the one dimensional spin-1/2 fermi gas called yang - gaudin model @xcite , where the fermions interact with each other via the @xmath3-function potential . due to the symmetry of the wave function",
    ", the interaction only occurs between two fermions with different spins .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system thus has the following form  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the atomic mass , @xmath6 characterizes the strength of the @xmath3-function interaction , and the field operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the fermionic atoms in the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in this work we focus on the case where a single spin - down fermion resides in the sea of @xmath11 spin - up fermions .",
    "the system described by the hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) is a prototypical integrable model , which has been experimentally realized with ultracold atoms trapped in 1d geometry  @xcite . in such 1d experiments ,",
    "the wave guide atoms are tightly confined in two transverse directions and weakly confined in the axial direction .",
    "consequently , the trapped atoms can be effectively described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) within the local density approximation  @xcite or by exact strong coupling ansatz wave functions of the trapped gas  @xcite . in these experiments",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath6 can be written as @xmath12 with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the effective 1d scattering length . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath14 is related to the 3d scattering length @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the transverse oscillator length , and a@xmath181.0326 is a constant . for repulsive fermions , c@xmath190 and for attractive fermions , c@xmath200 .",
    "the bethe ansatz solutions of the model provide a precise understanding of many - body phenomena and few - body physics , see review @xcite . in this paper",

    "they can be determined by the bethe ansatz equations  @xcite ( also see below ) .",
    "the total wave function of our system should be anti - symmetric under the permutation of any two fermions . to construct this total wave function ,",
    "we define @xmath30 where the subscript @xmath31 means that the @xmath32th fermion is spin - down while the rest of the fermions are spin - up . as a result , the total wave function takes the following form , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the normalization constant and @xmath35 denotes a spin state with the @xmath32th spin down and all other spins up .    for solving our problem ,",
    "we write down the following the ba equations  @xcite @xmath36 the corresponding eigen - energy is given by @xmath37 this problem of @xmath11 fermions of the up spin and one fermion of the opposite spin was studied by mcguire in 1965 and 1966  @xcite , who calculated only the energy shift caused by the extra spin - down fermion",
    ". however , the key feature of this impurity problem is the collective behavior of polaron and molecule , which lacks a comprehensive understanding . in the rest of the paper ( except section iv ) , for convenience and without loss of generality , we consider only the cases where @xmath21 is even .",
    "when a single attractive impurity is immersed in the fully - polarized fermi sea , an intuitive picture immediately arises as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ schemactic ] .",
    "the single impurity will be addressed by a cloud of fermions due to attraction .",
    "when the impurity moves , it will drag these fermions along .",
    "effectively , it can be regarded as a new particle with a different mass moving freely .",
    "this is the well known polaron .",
    "when the attraction becomes very strong , the impurity can pair with one fermion to form a molecule .",
    "this nature is reflected by haldane generalized exclusion statistics  @xcite , i.e. the statistical interaction and dynamical interaction are transmutable in 1d . for a weak attraction",
    ", we see that the quasimomentum of a spin - down fermion essentially depends on that of all spin - up fermions .",
    "this gives a statistical nature of polaron , namely mutual statistics  @xcite .",
    "whereas for a strong attraction , the spin - down fermion tightly bounds with a spin - up fermion from the fully - polarized fermi sea . in this circumstance",
    ", the statistics of the bond pair reveals a non - mutual statistics .    to rigorously establish such a transition",
    ", we examine the energy shift caused by the impurity and see how it changes with the interaction strength . when there is no interaction , the single spin - down fermion can share a momentum with a spin - up fermion .",
    "this implies mathematically that there exists a pair of @xmath38 s , say , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 . when the attractive interaction between spin - up fermion and spin - down fermion is turned on",
    ", these two momenta can become a pair of complex conjugates , @xmath42 , indicating the formation of a polaron or molecule .",
    "we first consider the weak coupling limit , @xmath43 . in this limit ,",
    "it is straightforward to find that @xmath44 and @xmath45 . with these two facts",
    "@xcite , we can readily obtain from eq.([ba01 ] ) and eq.([ba02 ] ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 s and @xmath48 are integers and @xmath49 .",
    "according to the fermi statistics , for the lowest energy state , we have @xmath50 ( for details see appendix b ) . from the above equations",
    ", we can calculate the energy of the system with a single spin - down fermion @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the ground state energy of the system when there is no interaction , that is , @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    ", we recover the ground state energy of the gas with @xmath11 spin - up fermions and one spin - down fermion given by mcguire  @xcite .    the energy expression ( [ polar ] )",
    "naturally gives the dispersion of a polaron - like quasiparticle moving slowly in the fully polarized fermi sea .",
    "it provides a rich insight into such collective nature of polaron : 1 ) the first term is the mean binding energy , showing that the spin - down fermion experiences a mean field attraction from the fully polarized fermi sea ; 2 ) the second term is the kinetic energy of a single classical particle with momentum @xmath56 and mass @xmath5 . when @xmath54 , this is just the kinetic energy for the newly added spin - down fermion .",
    "when @xmath57 but small , this kinetic energy does not change its form even though the spin - down fermion is interacting with spin - up fermions and has lost its individual character . in this regard , one can view the spin - down fermion addressed by the surround spin - up fermions as a polaron . in one dimension ,",
    "such a polaronic behaviour is a typical elementary excitation with infinite lifetime due to the reshuffle of the eigenstates in excitations .",
    "when @xmath58 becomes bigger , the effective mass of the polaron will be different from the bare mass @xmath5 ( the leading order contribution is proportional to @xmath59 ) , but overall picture remains the same : a fermi sea , a binding energy @xmath60 , and a classical particle with an effective mass @xmath1 .",
    "the above results are valid up to the first order of @xmath61 .",
    "the results to the second order of @xmath61 can be found in the appendix b. there is a correction to the binding energy . however , it is very hard to calculate the effective mass of the polaron for the order over the first order of @xmath61 .",
    "we now consider the strong coupling limit , @xmath62 .",
    "using @xmath63 as the perturbation parameter @xcite , we find @xmath64 and the @xmath65 real momenta @xmath66 with @xmath67@xmath68 and @xmath48 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "in addition , we find @xmath69 . therefore , the total energy is @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\big[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2(n-2)}{|c|}\\big]\\frac{\\hbar^{2}q^{2}}{2m}+(1+\\frac{8}{|c|})e_{0}\\,.\\label{molecule } \\label{moleculeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar to the case of weak coupling , this energy has three terms : the binding energy , the kinetic energy , and the fermi sea energy .",
    "however , all of them are different , and even the fermi sea energy is slightly modified by the strong interaction . in particular , the kinetic energy can be regarded as a quasi - particle with effective mass @xmath71 which is almost twice the bare mass @xmath5 . after a subtraction of the ground state energy and chemical potential within eq .",
