    "topological insulators ( tis ) are amongst the most actively investigated systems in condensed matter physics @xcite . in reality",

    "have edge states at their boundaries with peculiar transport and optical properties .",
    "for instance , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) , time - reversal symmetric quantum spin hall state  that is realized in hg(cd)te quantum wells ( qws )  is known to come along with helical edge states that are protected against elastic backscattering of non - magnetic impurities @xcite . however , not only the edge state physics of these systems is interesting but also the 2d bulk physics bears exciting novelties .",
    "the low - energy excitations of hg(cd)te qws are described by a model  the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model @xcite  that interpolates between the limiting cases of schrdinger and dirac fermions . this interplay between schrdinger and dirac physics",
    "constitutes an opportunity for new phenomena to emerge .",
    "we have , for instance , recently discovered collective charge excitations at zero doping , i.e. intrinsic plasmons , in this system which are absent in both separate limits @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we complement our study of the screening properties and the collective charge excitations of hg(cd)te qws on the basis of random phase approximation ( rpa ) , and hence present a comprehensive analysis of its polarization function in the static and full dynamic limit , at zero and finite doping . continuously tuning the parameters of the bhz model , we reproduce the limits of pure dirac and pure schrdinger fermions and explore intermediate regimes , in order to understand how analogies and differences emerge .",
    "we support our numerical calculations of the polarization functions with analytical expressions derived by f - sum rules . in the static limit",
    ", we calculate the screening properties due to the intrinsic system and at finite doping , analyzing the induced charge density ( with friedel oscillations ) in response to a charged impurity .",
    "different to the dirac fermion system graphene , where static screening in the intrinsic limit is momentum independent and can therefore be absorbed into an effective dielectric constant @xcite , the bhz model shows a significant momentum dependence that translates into a finite extent of the induced charge density . in the dynamic limit ,",
    "we are particularly interested in a better understanding of the plasmon excitations of this system away from zero doping where we previously found a new plasmon due to the interplay between schrdinger and dirac fermion physics  @xcite . at finite doping , under certain conditions specified below that are e.g. applicable to hg(cd)te qws , we find a coexistence between this novel ( interband ) plasmon and an ordinary ( intraband ) plasmon .",
    "both plasmons can be rather weakly damped by single - particle excitations and should therefore be observable .",
    "interestingly , the two plasmons respond to the topology of the bandstructure with a distinctive behavior .",
    "they seem to merge one into the other in a normal insulating phase , while they remain clearly resolved when the system realizes a topological insulator .",
    "generally , rpa is known to provide reliable predictions at large densities and in systems with a large number of fermionic degrees of freedom . while its validity was indeed questioned for the intrinsic dirac limit , where the system is unable to screen the coulomb interaction and strong renormalization effects",

    "will always be separated , with the intraband plasmon being confined to low energies .",
    "this stems from the fact that the electrons in the conduction band are pseudo - spin polarized , such that intraband excitations to much higher momenta and energies , where the pseudo - spin shows in the opposite direction , are not possible .",

    "the discussion of the full dynamical polarization function has been focused on the appearance of new interband plasmons due to the interplay of dirac and schrdinger physics . in principle , we expect these plasmons to appear in multiband systems where the imaginary part of the polarization function decays faster with energy than the one in the dirac case ( @xmath373 ) , which is the case for the bhz model ( decay as @xmath453 ) .",
    "these plasmons appear already in the undoped system at experimentally relevant parameters , but it is also possible to observe them in the doped regime , where they coexists with the usual intraband plasmons .",
    "this is favored by broken particle hole symmetry in the bhz model , which allows for the presence of both a dirac point and an inflection point in the bandstructure .",
    "the behavior of these two collective modes is also influenced by the topology of the bandstructure .",
    "indeed the two plasmons tend to merge into one another in a gapped trivial insulator , while they remain distinct resonances in the topological insulator phase .",
