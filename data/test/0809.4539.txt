    "the discovery of type1-like broad emission lines in the polarized spectrum of the type2 seyfert galaxy ngc1068 @xcite led to the foundation of the so - called unification model ( um ) of agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in which the orientation of a dusty torus plays a crucial role in the spectroscopic classification of the agn for a given observer .",
    "while this um is now well accepted for the lower luminosity agns , a key question is whether it applies to higher luminosity objects like quasars since the presence of the dusty torus may be affected by the higher radiation flux .    in order to get some insights into the quasar inner structure",
    ", we investigate the possible existence of a correlation between the direction of the linear optical polarization ( @xmath0 ) and the orientation of the major axis ( @xmath1 ) of the host galaxy / extended emission surrounding rq and rl quasars .",
    "the sample used in our study is made of type1 and type2 rq / rl quasars for which high resolution visible / near - ir images are available and with optical polarization data reported in the literature .",
    "we determined the @xmath1 for the objects with missing measurements by using the mcs deconvolution method @xcite . from this compilation , we selected a sub - sample of objects for which we have relevant and accurate data and then computed the acute angle @xmath2 between the directions defined by the @xmath1 and @xmath0 angles .",
    "further details about the quasar sample and the determination of the @xmath1 are available in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the angle @xmath2 as a function of the observation wavelength @xmath3 as measured in the quasar rest - frame is illustrated in the left panel of fig .  1 .",
    "from the analysis of the data plotted , we conclude that while no particular behavior is noted at redder wavelengths ( @xmath3 @xmath4  ) , a clear dichotomy appears in the uv / blue domain where the type1 quasars tend to have their ee preferentially aligned ( @xmath5 ) with the polarization direction , these two axes being mainly orthogonal ( @xmath6 ) in the type2 objects .",
    "moreover , the observed alignment effect seems to be independent of the radio - loudness .    in the case of the type2 quasars ,",
    "this behavior is known as the _ alignment effect _ reported by @xcite and @xcite where the extended uv / blue emission resolved in images is interpreted as an electron / dust polar region , scattering off the nuclear light and explaining the anti - alignment . in type1 quasars , the alignment can be explained by assuming a two - component scattering model ( see fig .  1 ) , similar to the one proposed for the seyfert galaxies by @xcite . in this scenario , an equatorial scattering region located inside",
    "the dusty torus produces a polarization aligned with the torus symmetry axis .",
    "the resulting polarization , the sum of the polar and equatorial contributions , is dominated by the equatorial component because of the higher symmetry of the polar region at smaller viewing angles ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
