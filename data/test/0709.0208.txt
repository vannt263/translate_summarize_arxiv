    "although lans@xmath0 and clark@xmath0 exhibit the same inertial range scaling arising from similarities in their krmn - howarth equations , clark@xmath0 is decidedly more intermittent than at the same time , lans@xmath0 is only slightly more intermittent than navier - stokes .",
    "these results are consistent with the artificial truncation of local nonlinear interactions ( in spectral space ) in the sgs stress tensor of each model .",
    "this effect is reduced for lans@xmath0 by the `` rigid - body regions '' enslaved in its larger scale flow which possess no internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced intermittency observed for leray@xmath0 is related to its smoother , more laminar fields as a result of its reduced effective @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we analyzed the reduction in the number of _ dof _ in the models , as compared to navier - stokes ( and , hence , their les potential based on their computational savings ) .",
    "we noted that as lans@xmath0 reproduces the intermittency properties of a dns quite well even for larger values of @xmath2 , some further reduction in numerical saving might be achieved provided the contamination due to its @xmath169 rigid - body energy spectrum were not important in a given application .",
    "as clark@xmath0 possesses a similar reduction in _ dof _ to lans@xmath0 , its les potential is tied to the optimal value of @xmath2 for les .",
    "our study indicates that clark@xmath0 may be applicable ( especially with regards to the energy spectrum ) for larger values of @xmath2 than lans@xmath0 .",

    "future work should include such a study for both leray@xmath0 and clark@xmath0 .",
    "all three regularizations were shown to be successful , in that their control of the flow gradient reduces the degrees of freedom and saves computation while preserving a properly defined reynolds number ( albeit for leray@xmath0 that definition is not yet ) .",
    "clark@xmath0 accurately reproduces the total dissipation , the time scale to obtain a turbulent statistical steady - state and the large - scale energy spectrum of a dns .",
    "these results seem to result from clark@xmath0 being an order @xmath195 approximation of navier - stokes .",
    "we have shown that leray@xmath0 reduces the effective reynolds number of the flow .",
