    "an important unsolved problem for the black - hole candidate ( bhc ) lmc x@xmath03 is the process of mass transfer . with an estimated mass of the companion star @xmath3 ( cowley et al .",
    "1983 ) , the system appears to be intermediate between high - mass black - hole binaries like cyg x@xmath01 ( mass of the companion star @xmath4 , see giles & bolton 1986 ) , and low - mass black - hole binaries like a0620@xmath000 ( mass of the companion star @xmath5 ) . in the former class of systems , mass",
    "transfer occurs mainly via a stellar wind , and the donor star is more massive than the primary ; in the latter , the donor star is usually a late - type star filling its roche lobe .",
    "the optical counterpart ( warren and penfold 1975 ) of lmc x@xmath03 shows ellipsoidal modulations with a total amplitude of @xmath6 mag and a period corresponding to the 1.705d binary period ( van der klis , tjemkes and van paradijs 1983 ; van der klis et al 1985 ) .",
    "it also shows long - term brightness variations in the range @xmath7 ( e.g. , van paradijs et al .  1987 ) .",
    "its optical spectrum was found to be consistent with that of a b3 main sequence star ( cowley et al .",
    "1983 ) . from the radial velocity shifts of the optical absorption lines ,",
    "cowley et al .  ( 1983 ) derived a mass function @xmath8 , thus establishing this system as a strong bhc .",
    "however , the spectral identification of the companion star remains uncertain ( mazeh et al .",
    "1986 ) because of the effect of x - ray irradiation on the secondary , and the possible contribution to the optical flux by an accretion disk .",
    "in fact , the long - term variations in both the optical colours and the @xmath9 brightness are found to be associated with changes in the soft x - ray flux ( cowley et al .",
    ".    moreover , nowak et al .  ( 2000 ) and wilms et al .  ( 2000 ) suggest that spectral transitions between a high - soft and a low - hard state could be associated with changes in the accretion rate .",
    "a more correct identification of the companion star can provide a better understanding of the physics of mass transfer and state transitions .",
    "lmc x@xmath03 was observed with the optical monitor 30 in telescope ( mason et al .",
    "1996 ) on board _ xmm - newton _ on 2000 april 19 ( mjd 51653 ; _ xmm - newton _ revolution 66 ) .",
    "a log of the observations is reported in table 1 .",
    "the system was in a low - hard state during our optical observation , with a pure power - law x - ray spectrum with photon index @xmath10@xmath11 ( boyd and smale 2000 ; wu et al .",
    "we estimate from simultaneous _ xmm - newton / pn _ observations ( wu et al .",
    "2000 ) that the 210 kev flux was @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 , at least two orders of magnitude lower than in the high - soft state ( nowak et al .",
    "2000 ; wilms et al .",
    "this is in agreement with the rxte / asm 210 kev lightcurve .",
    "therefore , optical photometric observations of the companion star at this epoch provide the best chance to determine its intrinsic colours and spectral type .",

    "2000 september ) , we find that this corresponds to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .    our observations covered a fraction of the binary phase ; therefore they may not yield the true phase - averaged brightness of the optical counterpart .",
    "if we adopt the ephemeris of van der klis ( 1985 ) , the @xmath9 images were centred at phase @xmath21 , the @xmath22 images at @xmath23 and the @xmath24 images at @xmath25 .",
    "however , those ephemeris may have accumulated too large an error to be still reliable . from the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations",
    ", we estimate that there is an additional error of 0.08 mag in the @xmath9 brightness , of 0.03 mag in the @xmath26 colour , and of 0.04 mag in the @xmath27 colour .",

    "both optical colour indices can be used as indicators of the effective temperature @xmath33 . from buser and kurucz ( 1978 ) , and cramer ( 1984 ) , we find that these intrinsic colours correspond to stars with @xmath34 k. the colour  temperature relation is almost independent of surface gravity , so that it can be applied to both main sequence and giant stars .",

    "in particular , a b3v companion ( @xmath57 ) would only fill less than half of the volume of its roche lobe . the main mechanism of mass transfer would have to be a stellar wind . if the wind were to account for x - ray luminosities up to @xmath58 erg s@xmath13 in the high - soft state ( johnston , bradt and doxsey 1979 )",

    "cowley et al .  ( 1983 ) determined @xmath73 km s@xmath13 and @xmath74 . using these values together with the values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 determined in section 4 , we obtain from equation ( 5 ) : @xmath77 as an aside",

    "equation ( 2 ) gives an upper limit @xmath79 .",
    "if the secondary star is really a b5 subgiant , its intrinsic luminosity is @xmath80 erg s@xmath13 ( figure 1 ) , corresponding to an intrinsic flux @xmath81 erg @xmath60 s@xmath13 .",
    "the radial velocity curve of the stellar absorption lines was obtained by cowley et al .",
    "( 1983 ) when the source was in a high state , implying an x - ray luminosity @xmath82 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "the orbital separation in a binary system is @xmath83 cm for lmc x@xmath03 .",
    "hence , the energy intercepted by the secondary star per unit time is @xmath84 erg s@xmath13 , comparable with the intrinsic luminosity of the star .    in a spherical approximations ,",
    "the intercepted flux is larger than the intrinsic flux on @xmath85 of the surface of the star , for a soft x - ray luminosity @xmath86 erg s@xmath13 , and for a disk with @xmath87 .",
    "strong external irradiation with soft x - rays tends to cause photo - ionisation at the surface of the secondary star . as a consequence ,",
    "absorption lines from the irradiated face should be weakened or suppressed , and the observed radial velocity shifts may not reflect the true orbital motion of the centre of mass of the secondary ( wade and horne 1988 ; phillips , shahbaz and podsiadlowski 1999 ) .    using the model previously applied to the bhc gro j1655@xmath040 ( phillips , shahbaz and podsiadlowski 1999 ) , and assuming for simplicity that no absorption lines are produced in the region where the external flux is larger than the internal flux , we can estimate the effect of irradiation in the case of lmc x@xmath03 .",
    "the observed amplitude of the radial velocity variations of the absorption lines ( @xmath70 ) should appear larger than the true radial velocity amplitude of the centre of mass of the secondary ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "for the parameters of lmc x@xmath03 , we estimate that the correction is @xmath89 km s@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the true @xmath90-velocity of the secondary star is only @xmath91    hence , after the correction , the mass function ( @xmath92 ) for the compact object in lmc x@xmath03 is @xmath93 by using these revised @xmath90-velocity and mass function in equation ( 5 ) , we obtain a lower limit to the mass of the compact object : @xmath94    it would be important to test this prediction by determining the radial velocity curve of the stellar lines during a low x - ray state",
    ". we also note that if the irradiated side of the secondary star contributes only to the optical continuum flux but not to the absorption lines , their relative strength would appear reduced in comparison with a non - irradiated star of the same spectral type .",
    "this is a possible explanation of what was observed by cowley et al .",
    "we have observed the bhc lmc x@xmath03 with the optical monitor on board _ xmm - newton _ during an x - ray low - hard state .",
    "the @xmath95@xmath96 kev flux at that epoch was the lowest ever observed by rxte / asm , consistent with zero .",
    "the brightness and colours of the optical counterpart inferred from our observations are likely to be a good approximation of the intrinsic values of the companion star .",
    "this allows us to constrain the mass and radius of the secondary .",
    "we have found that an evolved subgiant of mass @xmath97 and temperature @xmath98 k ( spectral type @xmath1 b5iv ) is consistent with the observed colours and luminosity .",
    "we have also shown that such a star would be filling its roche lobe , thus explaining why the source is mostly observed in a high - soft state , dominated by an accretion disk .",
    "no significant wind is expected from such star , in agreement with the low column density inferred from the _ xmm - newton / epic _ and _ rgs _ x - ray data .",
    "the evolutionary time - scale of a b5iv star is also consistent with the observed x - ray luminosity powered by nuclear - evolution driven mass transfer .",
    "the companion star was previously thought to be a main - sequence b3 star .",
    "although it would have the same brightness , a b3v star would fill only about one half of its roche lobe , ruling out mass transfer via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "a b5iv companion implies a lower limit to the mass of the primary @xmath99 , if we assume the @xmath90-velocity and mass function determined by cowley et al .",
    "however , the spectroscopic observations of cowley et al .  ( 1983 ) were carried out during an x - ray active state , when the effect of soft x - ray irradiation on the surface of the secondary star is significant .",
    "the true radial velocity amplitude of the centre of mass of the secondary is probably @xmath100@xmath101 per cent less than the value observed by cowley et al .",
