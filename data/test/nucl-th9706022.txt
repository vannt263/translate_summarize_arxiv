    "the measurement of electromagnetic observables such as the photon and dilepton spectra constitutes a major part of cern - sps heavy - ion programs .",
    "it will soon become one of major efforts at the bnl - rhic heavy - ion programs .",
    "the primary reason for this is that photons and dileptons do not suffer strong final - state interactions as hadrons do .",
    "they can thus be considered as ` penetrating probes ' of the initial hot and dense stages involved in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recent observation of the enhancement of low - mass dileptons in central heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps energies @xcite has generated a great deal of interest in the heavy - ion community .",
    "different dynamical models , such as the hydrodynamical and transport models , have been used to investigate this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "calculations based on ` conventional sources ' such as the dalitz decay and direct vector meson decay that account for the dilepton spectra in proton - induced reactions failed to explain the observed enhancement in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "various medium effects , such as the dropping vector meson masses @xcite as first proposed by brown and rho @xcite , the modification of rho meson spectral function @xcite , and the enhanced production of @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 @xcite , have been proposed to explain this enhancement .",
    "the last possibility has been ruled out by the measured @xmath0 spectra in the same reactions @xcite .",
    "the effects due to medium modifications of rho meson spectral function on low - mass dileptons have been examined using simplified fireball models @xcite ; questions remain concerning the exact space - time evolution and baryon chemical compositions which play an important role in the determination of the rho meson spectral function . in this contribution",
    "we will concentrate on the idea of dropping vector meson masses , which is the focus of section 3 .",
    "another piece of experimental data from cern - sps that has been discussed extensively is the single photon spectra from the wa80 collaboration @xcite . in various hydrodynamics calculations",
    "the absence of significant thermal photon production has been used as an indication of quark gluon plasma formation that lowers the initial temperature @xcite .",
    "however , detailed transport model calculations find this conclusion to be premature .",
    "this will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "a brief summary is given in section 5 .",
    "in studying medium effects in heavy - ion collisions , the relativistic transport model @xcite based on the walecka - type model @xcite has been quite useful , as it provides a thermodynamically consistent description of the medium effects through the scalar and vector fields . in heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps energies ,",
    "many hadrons are produced in the initial nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "this is usually modeled by the fragmentation of strings , which are the chromoelectric flux - tubes excited from the interacting quarks . one successful model for taking into account this",
    "nonequilibrium dynamics is the rqmd model @xcite . to extend the relativistic transport model to heavy - ion collisions at these energies ,",
    "we have used as initial conditions the hadron abundance and distributions obtained from the string fragmentation in rqmd .",
    "further interactions and decays of these hadrons are then taken into account as in usual relativistic transport model .    to study the effects of dropping vector meson masses @xcite on the dilepton spectrum in heavy - ion collisions",
    ", we have extended the walecka model from the coupling of nucleons to scalar and vector fields to the coupling of light quarks to these fields , using the ideas of the meson - quark coupling model @xcite . for a system of nucleons , pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons , and axial - vector mesons at temperature @xmath2 and baryon density @xmath3 ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath4 is determined self - consistently from @xmath5\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 0.45g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\eta^*\\over e_\\eta ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\eta ^*/t)-1}+ { 6g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\rho^*\\over e_\\rho ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\rho ^*/t)-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 2g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_\\omega^*\\over e_\\omega ^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_\\omega ^*/t)-1 } + { 6\\sqrt 2 g_\\sigma\\over ( 2\\pi ) ^3}\\int d{\\bf k } { m_{a_1}^*\\over e_{a_1}^ * } { 1\\over \\exp ( e_{a_1}^*/t)-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the constituent quark model relations for the nucleon and vector meson masses @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 , the quark structure of the @xmath0 meson in free space which leads to @xmath7 , and the weinberg sum rule relation between the rho - meson and @xmath8 meson masses , i.e , @xmath9 .",
    "we recently found that the use of a refined model , the effective chiral lagrangian of @xcite , led to essentially the same results for dilepton spectra @xcite .",
    "the main contributions to dileptons with mass below 1.2 gev are the dalitz decay of @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 , the direct leptonic decay of @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 , the pion - pion annihilation which proceeds through the @xmath12 meson , and the kaon - antikaon annihilation that proceeds through the @xmath13 meson .",
    "the differential widths for the dalitz decay of @xmath10 , @xmath0 , and @xmath11 are related to their radiative decay widths via the vector dominance model , which are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the decay of a vector meson into the dilepton is determined by the width , @xmath14 the coefficient @xmath15 in the dielectron channel is @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 , respectively , and is determined from the measured width . for the dimuon channel ,",
    "these values are slightly larger .    in our model",
    ", dileptons are emitted continuously during the time evolution of the colliding system .",
    "the way the dilepton yield is calculated can be illustrated by the decay of a rho meson . denoting , at time @xmath20 , the differential multiplicity of neutral rho mesons by @xmath21 , then the differential dilepton production probability is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the freeze - out time , which is found to be about 20 fm / c .",
    "the first term corresponds to dilepton emission before freeze out while the second term is from the decay of rho mesons still present at freeze out .",
    "the results for dilepton spectra from p+be and p+au collisions at 450 gev are shown in fig . 1 , together with data from the ceres @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the data can be well reproduced by dalitz decay of @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons , and direct leptonic decay of @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "these results are thus similar to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite using the hadron - string dynamics and those constructed by the ceres collaboration from known and expected sources of dileptons @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn concerning dimuon spectra in p+w collisions at 200 gev , which are shown in the left window of fig .",
    "our results for dilepton spectra in central s+au collisions are shown in the left window of fig .",
    "the dashed curve is obtained with free meson masses .",
    "although pion - pion annihilation is important for dileptons with invariant mass from 0.3 to 0.65 gev , it still does not give enough number of dileptons in this mass region .",
    "furthermore , for masses around @xmath24 there are more dileptons predicted by the theoretical calculations than shown in the experimental data .",
    "these are very similar to the results of cassing _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on the hadron - string dynamics model and srivastava _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on the hydrodynamical model .",
    "the results obtained with in - medium meson masses are shown by the solid curve .",
    "compared with the results obtained with free meson masses , there is about a factor of 2 - 3 enhancement of the dilepton yield in the mass region from 0.2 to 0.6 gev , which thus leads to a good agreement between the theoretical results and the ceres data .",
    "similar conclusions that dropping vector meson masses can explain the ceres dilepton data have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the right window of fig .",
    "3 we compare our prediction for central au+pb collisions at 160 agev with the preliminary data from the ceres collaboration .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath25 here is the average charge particle pseudo - rapidity density in the pseudo - rapidity range of 2 to 3 , and is about 440 in this collision . in the results with free meson masses , shown by the dashed curve",
    ", there is a strong peak around @xmath26 , which is dominated by @xmath12 meson decay as a result of an enhanced contribution from pion - pion annihilation in pb+au collisions than in s+au and proton - nucleus collisions . in the case of in - medium",
    "meson masses , shown by the solid curve , the @xmath19 meson peak shifts to a lower mass , and the peak around @xmath26 becomes a shoulder arising mainly from @xmath11 meson decay . at the same time",
    "we see an enhancement of low - mass dileptons in the region of 0.25 - 0.6 gev as in s+au collisions .",
    "the agreement with the data is thus significantly improved when dropping vector meson masses are used .",
    "the same model has been used to calculate the dimuon spectra from central s+w collisions .",
    "the results obtained with free meson masses are shown in the right window of fig .",
    "2 by the dashed curve , and are below the helios-3 data in the mass region from 0.35 to 0.6 gev , and slightly above the data around @xmath26 as in the ceres case .",
    "however , the discrepancy between the theory and the data is somewhat smaller in this case due to the smaller charged - particle multiplicity at a larger rapidity than in the ceres experiment .",
    "our results obtained with in - medium meson masses are shown in the right window of fig . 2 by the solid curve , and are in good agreement with the data . the importance of dropping rho meson mass in explaining the helios-3 data has also been found by cassing _",
    "single photon spectra in heavy - ion collisions at cern - sps energies have been measured by the wa80 collaboration @xcite .",
    "so far , only the upper bound has been determined for the so - called ` thermal ' photon spectra , which accounts for about 5% of the total observed single photon yield , which is dominated by neutral pion decay . in hydrodynamical calculations",
    "@xcite , the absence of significant thermal photons has been interpreted as an evidence for the formation of a quark gluon plasma . without phase transition , the initial temperature of the hadronic gas found in ref .",
    "@xcite is about 400 mev .",
    "this leads to a large number of thermal photons from hadronic interaction which is not observed experimentally .",
    "including the phase transition , the initial temperature is lowered to about 200 mev @xcite , because of increased degrees of freedom . with a lower initial temperature ,",
    "the thermal photon yield is thus reduced and is found to better agree with the wa80 data .",
    "however , a more recent analysis @xcite has shown that if one includes all hadron resonances with masses below 2.5 gev the initial temperature can also be lowered to about 200 mev , and the wa80 photon data can then be explained without invoking the formation of a quark gluon plasma .",
    "this is basically also the conclusion of the detailed transport model analysis presented here .    for the ` thermal ' photon spectra",
    "we include the decay of @xmath19 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath8 mesons , as well as two - body processes such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the decay width for @xmath29 is taken from the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes well the measured width for @xmath30 .",
    "both the @xmath11 and @xmath8 radiative decay widths are proportional to @xmath31 @xcite , with the coefficients determined from the measured width .",
    "for the two - body cross sections , we use the results of @xcite , which do not include the contribution from an intermediate @xmath8 meson .",
    "the latter has already been included in our model as a two - step process .    in fig .",
    "4 , our results for ` thermal ' photon spectra are compared with the upper bound from the wa80 collaboration . it is seen that the @xmath11 meson radiative decay plays an important role for photons with transverse momenta above 300 mev . in both the free and in - medium meson mass scenarios , our thermal photon yields do not exceed the experimental upper bound .",
    "although there are more rho and @xmath8 mesons in the case of in - medium meson masses , their contributions to single photon yield do not increase significantly , simply because their radiative decay widths decrease as a result of reduced phase space .",
    "in summary , we have studied dilepton production from both proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions using the relativistic transport model with initial conditions determined by string fragmentation from the initial stage of the rqmd model .",
    "it is found that the dilepton spectra in proton - nucleus reactions measured by the ceres and the helios-3 collaboration can be well understood in terms of conventional mechanisms of dalitz decay and direct vector meson decay . for dilepton spectra in central heavy - ion collisions , these conventional mechanisms ,",
    "however , fail to explain the data , especially in the low - mass region from about 0.25 to about 0.6 gev in ceres experiments , and from 0.35 to 0.65 gev in helios-3 experiments . including the contribution from pion - pion annihilation , which is important in the mass region from @xmath32 to @xmath26 ,",
    "removes some of the discrepancy .",
    "but the theoretical prediction is still substantially below the data in the low mass region and somewhat above the data around @xmath24 .",
    "the theoretical results are brought into good agreement with the data when reduced in - medium vector meson masses are taken into account .",
    "we have also calculated , within the same dynamical model , the thermal photon spectra in central s+au collisions . in both free meson masses and in - medium meson masses scenarios , our results do not exceed the upper bound deduced from the experiments by the wa80 collaboration .",
