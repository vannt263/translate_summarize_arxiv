    "einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) formulated their famous argument about the completness of quantum mechanics in the framework of continuous variable systems @xcite .",
    "however , after that bohm gave a dichotomized version of it @xcite , the debate concerning nonlocality moved to systems described by discrete variables , leading bell to formulate his celebrated inequalities in a dichotomized fashion @xcite .",
    "recently , the increasing importance of continuous variable systems leads many authors to explore the nonlocality issue in its original setting , where dichotomic observables to test bell s inequalities are not uniquely determined .",
    "the attempts to translate bell s inequalities to continuous variable systems clarified the fact that crucial in a nonlocality test is the existence of a set of dichotomized bounded observables used to perform the test itself , from which the so called `` bell operator '' is derived .",
    "the more debated question has dealt with the nonlocality of the normalized version of the original epr state , _",
    "i.e. _ the twin - beam ( twb ) state of radiation produced by spontaneuos downconversion in a parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "nonlocality of the twb state was not clear for a long time . using the wigner function approach ,",
    "bell argued that the original epr state , and as a consequence the twb too , does not exhibit nonlocality because its wigner function is positive , and therefore represents a local hidden variable description @xcite .",
    "more recently , banaszek and wodkiewicz @xcite showed instead how to reveal nonlocality of the epr state through the measurement of displaced parity operator .",
    "furthermore a subsequent work of chen et al .",
    "@xcite showed that twb s violation of bell s inequalities may achieve the maximum value admitted by quantum mechanics upon a suitable choice of the measured observables .",
    "indeed , the amount of violation crucially depends on the kind of bell operator adopted in the analysis , ranging from no violation to maximal violation for the same ( entangled ) quantum state .",
    "systems which involves only two parties are the simplest setting where to study violation of local realism in quantum mechanics .",
    "a more complex scenario arises if multipartite systems are considered .",
    "studying the peculiar quantum features of these systems is worthwhile in view of their relevance in the development of quantum communication technology , _",
    "e.g. _  to manipulate and distribute information in a quantum communication network @xcite .",
    "although the study of multipartite nonlocality has originated without the use of inequalities @xcite , an approach to derive bell inequalities has been developed @xcite also for these systems and applied to characterize their entanglement properties @xcite .",
    "being originally developed in the framework of discrete variables , these multiparty bell inequalities have found application also in the characterization of continuous variable systems @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to apply the various approaches hitherto developed to test nonlocality of two- and three - mode continuous variable systems .",
    "we will consider tripartite gaussian states as well as non - gaussian bipartite states .",
    "in the first case strong violation of bell inequalities is found , allowing the bell factor to reach values of @xmath0 , while in the second case enhancement of nonlocality is obtained in comparison with the twb case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : rev ] we review the different approaches to test nonlocality in the framework of continuous variables and introduce notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the three - mode states we are interested in are introduced in sec .",

    "[ s:2 m ] , the tripartite states are considered as sources for conditional generation of non - gaussian bipartite states , whose nonlocal proprties are then studied in [ ss : dp2 ] , [ ss : ps2 ] and [ ss : h2 ] .",
    "finally , the main results obtained are summarized in sec .",
    "[ s : conclusions ] , which closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we will briefly recall the inequalities imposed by local realism in the cases of our interest .",
    "let us start by focusing our attention on a bipartite system .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote two possible outcomes of two possible measurements on the first subsystem and similarly @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the second subsystem .",
    "the essential feature of this measurements is that they are local , dichotomic and bounded .",
    "the bell s combination @xmath5 under the assumption of local realism gives rise to the well known bell - chsh inequality @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the correlation function between the measurement results , _",
    "i.e. _ , the expectation value of the products of the results of the experiments @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in the case of a n - partite system ,",
    "a nonlocality test is possible using the bell - klyshko inequalities @xcite which provides a generalization of inequality ( [ bi2 ] ) .",
    "these inequalities are based on the following recursively defined linear combination : @xmath10f_{n-1}+\\frac12 \\left[m(\\alpha_n)-m(\\alpha_n')\\right]f'_{n-1 } \\label{fn}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to measurements on the n - party of the system , and @xmath13 denote the same expression as @xmath14 but with all the @xmath15 and @xmath16 inverted . in the case of a three - partite system ,",
    "local realism assumption imposes the following inequality from combination ( [ fn ] ) : @xmath17 where again @xmath18 is the correlation function between the measurement results .",
    "quantum mechanical systems can violate inequalities ( [ bi2 ] ) and([bi3 ] ) by a maximal amount given by , respectively , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now briefly review three different strategies to reveal quantum nonlocality in the framework of continuous variables systems . recall that in the case of a discrete bipartite system , for example a spin-@xmath21 two particle system , the local dichotomic bounded observable usually taken into account",
    "is the spin of the particle in a fixed direction , say @xmath22 .",
    "hence the correlation between two measurements performed over the two particles is @xmath23 , where the operator @xmath24 is decomposed on the pauli matrices base and @xmath25 are two unit vectors .",
    "the bell operator is then given by the expression : @xmath26    consider now a n - partite continuous variable system identified by the creation operator @xmath27 and the annihilation operator @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) with boson commutation relations associated .",
    "following the original argument by epr it is quite natural attempting to reveal the nonlocality of this system trying to infer quadratures of one subsystem from those of the others .",
    "from now on , we will refer to this procedure as a `` homodyne nonlocality test '' , as quadrature measurements of radiation field are performed through homodyne detection . here",
    "we identify the quadrature @xmath30 according to the definition @xmath31 . as they are local but neither bounded nor dichotomic , quadrature observables are not immediately suitable to perform a nonlocality test based on bell s inequalities .",
    "the procedure to make them bounded and dichotomic is quite arbitrary and consist in the assignment of two domains @xmath32 and @xmath33 to each observable @xcite .",
    "when the result of a quadrature measurement falls in the domain @xmath34 the value @xmath35 is associated to it .",
    "usually the choice @xmath36 is considered , though a choice suitable to the system under investigation may be preferable . considering a bipartite system we can introduce the following quantities : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the joint probability distribution of the quadratures @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we can now identify the homodyne correlation function @xmath41 as @xmath42 which can be straightforwardly used to construct the bell combination @xmath43 of eq.([bi2 ] ) and to perform the nonlocality test .",
    "the main problem of pursuing such a nonlocality test is that it is not suitable in case of systems described by a positive wigner function , as the twb state of radiation defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "indeed , a positive wigner function can be interpreted as a hidden phase - space probability distribution , preventing violation of bell - chsh inequality unless the measured observables have an unbounded wigner representation , which is not the case of the dichotomized quadrature measurement described above .",
    "considering in fact that @xmath38 can be determined as a marginal distribution from the wigner function one can write from eqs .",
    "( [ ph ] ) and ( [ eh ] ) : @xmath47 where the integration is performed over the whole phase - space and without loss of generality we have considered @xmath48 .",
    "eq.([ehwpos ] ) itself is indeed a local hidden variable description of the correlation function , hence obeying inequality ( [ bi2 ] ) .    in order to overcome this obstacle different strategies",
    "have been considered by many authors , based essentially on parity measurements .",
    "banaszek and wodkiewicz @xcite demonstrated the nonlocality of the twb considering as local observable on subsystem @xmath49 the parity operator on the state displaced by @xmath15 ( hence we will refer to this procedure as a `` displaced parity ( dp ) nonlocality test '' ) , which is dichotomic and bounded : @xmath50 in the above formula , @xmath51 , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 $ ] denote the number operator and the phase space displacement operator for the subsystem @xmath49 .",
    "hence the correlation function reads : @xmath54 from which bell s combinations @xmath55 in eq.([bi2 ] ) and @xmath56 in eq.([bi3 ] ) can be easily reconstructed in the cases @xmath57 .",
    "the reason why this procedure would be able to reveal nonlocality also in case of quantum states characterized by a positive wigner function is clear using the following relation : @xmath58 indeed , the analog of eq.([ehwpos ] ) is : @xmath59 being the dirac-@xmath60 distribution unbounded , ineqs .",
    "( [ bi2 ] ) and ( [ bi3 ] ) are no more necessarily valid for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the maximal violation found with this procedure for a epr state is @xmath61 @xcite , still far from the maximum violation admitted by quantum mechanics .",
    "another strategy , developed by chen et al .",
    "@xcite , shares a similar behavior as the one described above , allowing to reveal nonlocality for quantum states with positive wigner function .",
    "interestingly , this type of nonlocality test , which we will refer to as `` pseudospin ( ps ) nonlocality test '' , admits a maximum violation for the epr state . it can be seen as a generalization to continuous variable systems of the one introduced by gisin and peres for the case of discrete variable systems @xcite , hence , for the case of a pure bipartite system , it is equivalent to an entanglement test @xcite",
    ". let us consider the following set of operators , known as _",
    "pseudospins _ in view of their commutation relations , @xmath62 acting on the @xmath49-th subsystem @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a unit vector associated to the angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in analogy to the spin-@xmath21 system and defining @xmath68 the correlation function",
    "is simply given by : @xmath69 from which the bell combinations @xmath70 and @xmath71 are evaluated .",
    "also different representations of the spin-@xmath21 algebra have been discussed in the recent literature @xcite . in particular in ref .  @xcite it has been pointed out that different representations lead to different expectation values of the bell operators .",
    "hence , the violation of bell inequality for continuous variable systems turns out to depend , besides to orientational parameters , also to configurational ones . in the following sections we will also consider the pseudospin operators @xmath72 taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , which have the following wigner representation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 stands for the `` principal value '' .",
    "the correlation function obtained using operators @xmath77 will be indicated as @xmath78 .",
    "in this section we will analyze the nonlocal properties of tripartite gaussian states .",
    "in particular we will consider two classes of states , the first one proposed by van loock and braunstein @xcite , the second one proposed in @xcite .",
    "the reason why we consider this two classes is that the first is a very natural and scalable way to produce multimode entanglement using only passive optical elements and single squeezers , while the second one is the simplest way to produce three mode entanglement using a single nonlinear optical device .",
    "indeed , both states can be achieved experimentally @xcite . as concern the first class of states , it is generated with the aid of three single mode squeezed states combined in a `` tritter '' ( a three mode generalization of a beam - splitter ) .",
    "the evolution is then ruled by a sequence of single and two mode quadratic hamiltonians . as a consequence ,",
    "being generated from vacuum , the three - mode entangled state is gaussian and its wigner function is given by : @xmath79 \\label{wvlb}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the positions and momenta of the three modes and @xmath82 is the inverse of the covariance matrix , whose explicit expression reads : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath46 is the squeezing parameter ( with equal squeezing in all initial modes ) . the second class of tripartite entangled states is generated in a single non linear crystal through the following interaction hamiltonian : @xmath87 @xmath88 describes two interlinked bilinear interactions taking place among three modes of the radiation field coupled with the support of two parametric pumps .",
    "it can be realized in @xmath89 media by a suitable configuration exposed in ref .",
    "notice that the same dynamics can be implemented in different physical systems , including optomechanical couplers and bose - einstein condensates in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "the effective coupling constants @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath91 , of the two parametric processes are proportional to the nonlinear susceptibilities and the pump intensities .",
    "if we take the vacuum @xmath92 as the initial state , the evolved state @xmath93 belongs to the class of the coherent states of @xmath94 and it reads @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 represent the average number of photons in the @xmath49-th mode and @xmath97 are phase factors .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath98 are : @xmath99 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ n_3 & = & \\frac{|\\gamma_1|^2}{\\omega ^2 } \\sin^2(\\omega t ) \\ ; , \\label{ndit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "also for this second class , being the initial state gaussian and the hamiltonian quadratic , the evolved states will be gaussian .",
    "the wigner function reads as follows @xcite : @xmath102 \\label{wt}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the inverse of the covariance matrix , whose explicit expression is : @xmath104 where @xmath105 both classes of states are fully inseparable for any value of the coupling constants , namely can not be written as a factorized state for any grouping of the modes .",
    "therefore they are good candidates to reveal true tripartite nonlocality .",
    "being gaussian states , however , nonlocality can not be revealed by homodyne detection . in the following",
    "we analyze the results for displaced parity and pseudospin tests .",
    "let us start the study of tripartite systems nonlocality using the `` displaced parity test '' .",
    "considering the correlation function @xmath106 given by eq .",
    "( [ edp ] ) , the state ( [ wvlb ] ) was found in @xcite to give a maximal violation of @xmath107 in the limit of large squeezing and small displacement .",
    "the study in @xcite however was performed for a particular choice of displacement parameters : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "a numerical optimization of the displacement parameters lead us to identify a number of parameterizations that allow a significantly higher violation of bell s inequality . as an example , consider the one given by @xmath110 and @xmath111 from which follows that @xmath112 hence the remarkably high asymptotic value of @xmath113 is found for large @xmath46 and @xmath114 ( see fig .",
