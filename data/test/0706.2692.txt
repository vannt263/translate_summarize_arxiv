    "redshifted absorption systems lying along the sight - lines to distant quasars are important probes of the early - to - present day universe . in particular , damped lyman-@xmath2 absorption systems ( dlas ) , where @xmath5 , are useful as they account for at least 80% of the neutral gas mass density in the universe @xcite .",
    "since the lyman-@xmath2 transition occurs in the ultra - violet band , direct ground based observations of this transition are restricted to redshifts of @xmath6 , although observations of the  spin - flip transitions at @xmath7 cm can probe neutral hydrogen from @xmath8 , thereby providing a useful complement to the high redshift optical data . furthermore",
    ", 21-cm observations can be used to confirm and complement reported variations in the fundamental constants over the history of the universe @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , redshifted radio absorption systems are currently very rare with only 50  21-cm absorption systems known ( summarised in @xcite ) , 17 of which are dlas , with only nine of these having sufficiently high quality uv / optical and 21-cm data @xcite .",
    "we are therefore currently undertaking a survey of , as yet unsearched , dlas occulting radio - loud quasars in order to increase the number of 21-cm absorbing systems and in this letter we report our first detection , in the intriguing dla towards 1622 + 238 ( 3c336 ) .",
    "the observations were performed on 910 july 2006 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) as part of our survey ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "the front - end was the uhf - high receiver tuned to 857.68 mhz ( or @xmath9 , @xcite ) , backed with a band - width of 5 mhz over 2048 channels ( dual polarisation ) , giving a channel width of 0.85 .",
    "the two orthogonal polarisations ( xx & yy ) were used in order to allow the removal of any polarisation - dependent radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "after the flagging out of time - dependent rfi , 12.0 hours of good data remained , although there was some rfi remaining on some baselines , particularly in the xx polarisation .",
    "after further flagging , 63 full and partial baseline pairs remained .",
    "additionally , frequencies below 856.6 mhz ( channels above 1500 ) were removed due to a steep 1 jy dip in the flux .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad interferometry reduction package , with which we extracted a summed spectrum from the emission region of the continuum map . upon this , we found absorption towards the peak of the radio continuum apparent in both polarisations . after subtracting the continuum with a first order polynomial from the line free channels of the combined polarisations ,",
    "a single gaussian gives the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ 1622 ] .",
    "the obvious caveat with the detection is the lack of flat baseline in the spectrum above @xmath10  due to the lost channels .",
    "however , the spectra obtained in each individual polarisation are fitted by very similar gaussians .",
    "furthermore , if instead we use 3c286 for the bandpass calibration , which was observed at the start of the run , rather than 3c48 , which was observed at the end , the data give very similar profiles ( again with the 1 jy dip in the flux below 856.6 mhz ) , which are fitted by the same gaussian parameters as before .",
    "as would be expected from a real feature towards an unresolved ( @xmath11 ) background source , the line is present in the centre and surrounding pixels , but disappears with increasing proximity from the centre pixel .",
    "we also produced a cube in which 1622 + 238 is offset from the phase centre : while the absorption was still apparent towards 1622 + 238 , no feature was seen at the phase centre . as a further check , we used 3c48 to bandpass calibrate 3c286 , and , as seen from fig . [ 1622 ] ( top panel )",
    ", there is no overall ripple in the spectrum .",
    "at @xmath12 , the peak optical depth is at the lower end of the dlas detected in 21-cm absorption ( table 1 of @xcite ) , although the large line - width gives a velocity integrated optical depth of @xmath1 , which takes it to joint 5th place in the line strength stakes ( table [ res ] ) . in the optically thin regime ( @xmath13 ) , the total atomic hydrogen column density , @xmath14 [ ] , of the absorbing gas in a homogeneous cloud is related to the velocity integrated optical depth of the 21-cm line via @xmath15 where @xmath16 [ k ] is the spin temperature of the gas , @xmath17 is the covering factor of the flux by the absorber and @xmath18 is the velocity integrated optical depth of the 21-cm absorption .",
    "if the 21-cm and lyman-@xmath2 absorption arise in the same cloud complexes , the total neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath19  @xcite , gives @xmath20  k , the lowest value yet detected in a redshifted source ( table [ res ] ) .",
    ".the dlas detected in 21-cm absorption listed in order of increasing spin temperature / covering factor ratio .",
    "@xmath21 is the redshift of the dla , @xmath18 is the velocity integrated optical depth of 21-cm absorption [ ] , @xmath14 is the total neutral hydrogen column density [ ] of the absorber ( see @xcite ) , which is unknown for the dlas towards 0248 + 430 and 2351 + 456 .",
    "the optical identification of the absorber ( i d ) is given : d  dwarf , l  lsb , s ",
    "spiral , u  unknown .",
    "@xmath22 is the inferred spin temperature / covering factor ratio [ k ] .",

    "since both the spin temperature and covering factor are generally unknown , the degeneracy in the ratio is best left intact @xcite , although for @xmath26 ( by definition ) this means that @xmath27 k.    the 21-cm absorption profile in this absorber is much wider than that found in other dlas ( @xmath28 , see table 1 of @xcite ) and more like the typical  emission profile of a galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note also , in the other dlas the 21-cm profile - width is always narrower than the metal - ion lines ( typically fwhm@xmath29 , @xcite ) , but in this case fwhm@xmath30 , which suggests very different kinematics from those of the typical dla .",
    "in fact , for other dlas the spin temperature is often compared with the kinetic temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) , which should be equivalent for single cloud in thermodynamic equilibrium . applying @xmath31 to 1622 + 238",
    "gives the unphysical @xmath32 k , confirming that kinematical motions are chiefly responsible for the wide profile .        in fig .",
    "[ overlay ] we show the hst wfpc2 ( f702w filter ) optical image of the field towards 3c336 ( @xmath34 ) overlaid with the radio maps .",
    "although there is compact 8.4 ghz emission from the qso itself , most of the radio emission is from the extended lobes , which span an enormous @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the dla towards this qso is somewhat of a mystery , since the only galaxy in the hst field with a redshift of @xmath0 must have a projected disk impact parameter of @xmath36 kpc @xcite .",
    "since no other galaxy within this impact parameter has ever been found , @xcite suggest , but stipulate as unlikely , that the absorption may be due to an under - luminous late - type spiral , in which an invisible disk spans at least all of the way from the identified @xmath33 galaxy to the qso sight - line .    as an alternative",
    ", the authors suggest that there may be other galaxies within this impact parameter , although as these are undetected , they would have to be extremely faint ( @xmath37 ) . another possibility is offered by the galaxy of unknown redshift close to the optical hotspot , or even the hotspot itself ,",
    "both of which are located close to a radio lobe sight - line @xcite .",
    "if these ( and perhaps some other low luminosity galaxies ) , were part of a group , which included the @xmath33 galaxy , the redshift criterion would be satisfied , while perhaps providing a large  reservoir located closer to the qso sight - line .",
    "furthermore , the  could be largely dispersed over the region through the mutual tidal interactions of these galaxies @xcite .      from fig .",
    "[ overlay ] , we see that , although the identified @xmath33 galaxy is located close to the sight - line of a radio lobe , it remains sufficiently remote to be covering a negligible amount of flux . although we can not determine the location of the absorbing region within the radio - bright region , we may obtain an estimate of its extent : the circular region centered on the @xmath33 galaxy represents the physical area which encompasses 0.88% of the total 858 mhz flux .",
    "that is , this is the smallest region that can give the observed optical depth . so",
    "although the visible feature identified as the @xmath33 galaxy does not intercept much radio flux , a cold , invisible disk of @xmath38  kpc ( 3.3 ) radius could cover significant radio emission ( as shown in the figure ) , although , as per the reservations of @xcite , it may not necessarily be centered upon this galaxy .",
    "in fact , the 21-cm and lyman-  absorption may not be coincident with one another , in light of the relative profile widths and offset in the profiles ( fig . [ 1622 ] ) .    for a zero intrinsic velocity offset , one can estimate the variability of the constant @xmath39 , where @xmath2 is the fine structure constant , @xmath40 the proton @xmath41-factor and @xmath42 is the electron - to - proton mass ratio .",
    "in such a case , the relative change in the value of @xmath43 between redshift @xmath44 and a terrestrial ( @xmath8 ) value is given by ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the observed absorption redshifts for 21-cm and a uv heavy - element transition , respectively .",
    "using the gaussian fit centroid , @xmath48 , and the stongest mg i component , @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than any of the eleven other values which have been determined ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , suggesting that the velocity offset between the 21-cm and uv absorption is not primarily due to the values of the fundamental constants at @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the observed @xmath51 km s@xmath52 velocity difference , in conjunction with the atypical 21-cm line - width , suggests a physical offset between the cold , 21-cm absorbing , and warm , uv absorbing , gas .",
    "however , although not completely coincident , hydrogen is observed in both regimes , within the same field ( possibly remote from the qso sight - line ) , at ( nearly ) the same redshift , and so we find it unlikely that the radio and uv absorption are not related in some way .",
    "the width of the 21-cm absorption in comparison to the optical lines , and that of other dlas , may be the result of an atypical situation where we have an extended absorber occulting an extended radio source .",
    "however , all of the known dlas associated with spiral galaxies also occult large radio sources ( figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , although located much closer to the spirals than the other dlas in terms of @xmath22 , due to the wide profile , the 21-cm absorption towards 1622 + 238 may be somewhat of an anomaly ( fig .",
    "[ toverf ] ) , as per the other dlas , @xmath53 would be @xmath54 k , placing this bang in the middle of the spirals in fig .",
    "[ toverf ] . ] .",
    "if the system is bound and the wide 21-cm profile is purely the result of rotational broadening ( i.e. not an outflow ) , the total line - width of @xmath55 , leads to a dynamical mass estimate of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 [ kpc ] is the edge of the cold  distribution [ or the 858 mhz emission , whichever comes first ] . in the case",
    "where this gas is located close to the qso sight - line , so that the identified @xmath33 galaxy is actually near the edge of the absorbing disk or group is the inclination of the most rapidly orbiting galaxies and neglecting their individual rotations .",
    "] , i.e. @xmath58 kpc @xcite , the dynamical mass becomes @xmath59 .",
    "if the gas is due to a large spiral , centered on the @xmath33 galaxy ) is far too low to resolve possible contributions from smaller discrete galaxies .",
    "] , by assuming circular motions and the same inclination as the visible `` nucleus '' ( 55 , @xcite ) , the deprojected velocities and impact parameter give @xmath60  ( for @xmath58 kpc ) .",
    "although large , the derived masses are close to the values derived for the two most local spirals , the milky way ( @xmath61  , @xcite ) and m31 ( @xmath62  , @xcite ) , and certainly reasonable for a group of smaller galaxies .    combining this dynamical mass with the luminosity of @xmath63 @xcite @xcite .",
    "] , gives a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath64 /.",
    "such ratios ( @xmath65 / ) , define the hypothesised low density galaxies ( ldgs ) , which can range in mass from @xmath66 to @xmath67  @xcite . in an ldg",
    "a low density disk resides in a dark halo , with the surface density below that required by the toomre criterion for instabilities to form ( @xmath68 , @xcite ) , and so there is no ongoing star formation : from deep hst h  imaging , @xcite determine a star formation rate of @xmath69  yr@xmath70 kpc@xmath71 in the 3c336 field .",
    "another possible example of an ldg may already have been observed as the `` dark hydrogen cloud '' , virgohi 21 in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "this has a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath72 /  and spans at least 16 kpc in extent .",
    "if it is a galaxy , this has a mass of @xmath73 , although , as may be the case towards 1622 + 238 , the large amount of gas could be due to tidal debris .",
    "where ever the  ( ly-  & 21-cm ) absorption arises towards 1622 + 238 , it is clear that this would not be the first time a large amount of unidentified neutral hydrogen has been detected .",
    "we have detected 21-cm absorption in the @xmath0 damped lyman-@xmath2 absorber towards 1622 + 238 ( 3c336 ) .",
    "if the absorption arises in the same gas as the lyman-@xmath2 absorption , the spin temperature of the gas is @xmath4 k , the lowest yet found in a dla .",
    "the low spin temperature is a consequence of the extremely wide profile , which , most atypically , is wider than the mgii line .",
    "this could be due to a large absorber occulting what we know to be large radio source .",
    "the 21-cm is also offset from the unsaturated mgi absorption by @xmath74 , which corresponds to @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , which is an order of magnitude larger than that expected from other dlas , suggesting that the offset is not dominated by different values of the fundamental constants at @xmath33 .",
    "it may indicate , instead , that the radio and uv absorption are unrelated , although a lower lyman-@xmath2 column density would give gas significantly colder than 60 k. furthermore , it seems somewhat strange that the hydrogen absorbers detected in two different regimes at the same redshift would be unrelated , especially considering that none of these seems to arise directly along the qso sight - line . regarding this",
    ", our results can not distinguish from where the hydrogen absorption arises , whether this be the disk of a large underluminous spiral , an extremely faint galaxy lying close to the qso sight - line or a possible tidal interaction , between other faint galaxies , which is dragging significant amounts of gas across the sight - line .",
    "we would like to thank raffaella morganti for coordinating the wsrt observations , alan bridle and teddy cheung for their radio images , and bob carswell , martin zwaan , steve longmore , alan pedlar , rob beswick , matt owers and matthew whiting for their advice .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
