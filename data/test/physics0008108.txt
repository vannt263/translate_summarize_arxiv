    "in our first scenario , the main linac remains as close as possible to an equipotential surface .",
    "minimalism suggests that we try bending the beam by vertically translating already existing nlc quadrupoles , without introducing new elements or additional magnetic fields .",
    "we thus propose that steering be accomplished by precisely aligning all the quads `` level '' along the equipotential and then raising the vertically defocusing ( d ) quadrupoles to steer the beam through the centers of the vertically focusing ( f ) quads .",
    "bending at the d quad locations will minimize the generated dispersion .    to estimate the order of magnitude of dispersion produced by such an arrangement , we calculate ( a ) assuming a periodic sequence of magnets while ( b ) neglecting the effects of acceleration @xcite and ( c ) keeping only leading terms in the bend angle .",
    "our results will be reasonably correct provided that upstream injection into the main linac is redesigned to match the new arrangement .",
    "further details of the calculation and others discussed in this paper are documented elsewhere .",

    ", this offset is @xmath4 to make a numerical estimate of this offset at the high energy end of the linac , we take and eq.([eq : ih49bn ] ) then yields the dispersion can be estimated easily using two observations : ( 1 ) in passing through a thin bending magnet , the slope of the dispersion function , @xmath5 , changes by an amount approximately equal to the bend angle ; ( 2 ) by symmetry , the dispersion attains its maximum ( minimum ) value at the center of the focussing ( defocussing ) quadrupole .",
    "the values of the dispersion function at the thin - lens quadrupoles will be @xmath6 using the same parameters as before , this provides the numerical estimate , at the high energy end of the linac , @xmath7 if we take a large because of bns damping , and assume that the `` invariant emittance '' and at a point where the electron s energy is then @xmath8 compared to @xmath9 vertical bending will produce synchrotron radiation , which , in its turn , will add to the vertical emittance of the beam . at high energy ,",
    "the total energy radiated by one electron is given by the expression , @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the bend radius , @xmath12 is the relativistic and the other variables need no introduction . in terms of the electron energy , @xmath13 , and the bend angle , @xmath14 , produced by the quad over its length , @xmath15 , @xmath16    using the same parameters as before , at the high energy end of the linac ,  gev , and  m ; our estimate of the total radiated energy ( per electron per bend ) is about 28  kev . put another way , the ratio , it is inconceivable that such a small fractional change in beam energy could seriously damage the emittance , but we will estimate its effect anyway .",
    "the additional invariant emittance due to synchrotron radiation is approximated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 at the quadrupole location .    plugging in the same numbers as before , estimating  m , and using our previous estimates for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we obtain ,  nm  as expected , a very small number .",
    "although the 2  @xmath2 m offset of an off - momentum particle predicted in the previous section is not catastrophic , neither is it completely negligible .",
    "we will now consider eliminating it by employing the second scenario : constructing a main linac that is laser straight except for highly localized bends at a few , widely separated locations .",
    "these bend sites then allow us to follow the equipotential in a coarser , piece - wise fashion .",
    "if we think of bending every kilometer , or so , then the bend angle should be about 160  @xmath2rad .",
    "we ll take this as the `` canonical '' value for calculations in this section .",
    "we will proceed again in a minimalist way . in order to minimize the modification of existing lattice hardware and optics ,",
    "we adopt the use of combined function magnets to both bend and focus the electron beam .",
    "other possibilities could be considered at a later date .",
    "if we only `` bend '' at each of the local sites , a dispersion wave of amplitude @xmath23  4  mm would be generated at each bend center .",
    "to match the trajectories at the end of each local bending region for particles with various momenta , the total bend angle of each region is distributed across four neighboring ( combined function ) dipoles .",
    "the strategy is akin to that of an 18@xmath24 century optician designing a simple focussing achromat .",
    "the results at the lowest energy bending location are shown in figure  [ fig:1b ] .",
    "orbit deviation required to zero the residual dispersion . , width=340 ]    the dashed line follows the residual dispersion , now completely contained within the @xmath25  40  m long bending region , with maximum amplitude of about 0.6  mm .",
    "the maximum orbit distortion of 1  mm is too large an offset from the central ( curved ) axis of the local bending magnets .",
    "they would have to be displaced so as to follow the new orbit .",
    "a few iterations of these manipulations should then converge on an acceptable design",
    ". however , the final orbit and its local residual dispersion should not be much different from what we have calculated here .",
    "for now , we simply display these results as indicating the order of magnitude of the effects .",
    "the distortions in the trajectory at ten locations located @xmath231  km apart in the nlc are of the order 1 - 2  mm , with the higher displacements occuring at the higher energies .",

    "_ away from these sites , the dispersion is ( essentially ) zero , and its contribution to emittance is negligible .",
    "we note in passing that an advantage of this calculation is that one can envision making it operational .",

    "the values of at all bend locations are plotted in figure  [ fig : wx ] .",
    "each site contains one dominant , very sharp bend .",
    "its effect is most apparent near the high energy end of the linac , where the @xmath28 dependence becomes overwhelming .",
    "even so , the additional @xmath25  1  nm in invariant emittance is less than 1% of the 140  nm vertical emittance expected within the interaction region .",
    "notice that although the synchrotron radiation is rather high at the end of the linac , the ratio @xmath29 is still a small number .",
    "in passing , we note that some attention should be given to coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) from individual bunches .",
    "a quick look@xcite shows that the current nlc design has an aperture so csr is forbidden , even at the high energy end of the linac , because of `` shielding '' from the walls of the beam pipe .",
    "however , the margin of safety is not comfortably large .",

    "while present nlc designs with beam energies in the range of a few hundred gev to 1 tev may not be very sensitive to the curvature of the earth , there will be a practical limit to the upgraded energy of such a device .",
    "suppose the scheme of steering the beam with offset quadrupoles is adopted .",
    "then , at high energies , eventually the energy gain within a fodo cell will be equal to the energy lost due to synchrotron radiation as the beam is bent by the offset quadrupole .",
    "this limit can be easily written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy gain per meter of the linac . as the energy is increased , both the quadrupole length ( strength ) and the half - cell length increase roughly proportionally .",
    "as an example , using @xmath31 = 50  mev / m , and @xmath32 = 0.025 , then we get @xmath33 6.5  tev",
    ".        the emittance growth due to synchrotron radiation is also plotted , showing that a growth of @xmath34 = 100 nm ( roughly equal to the nlc nominal design value at collision ) occurs well before the final energy is reached , with the emittance growth being a steep function of energy ( @xmath35 ) . for 50  mev / m , the practical limit of a curved linac may be only about 2 - 3  tev per beam , which would have a length of about 50 km . for 150  mev / m ,",
    "the limits are 3 - 4  tev per beam over about 20  km .",
