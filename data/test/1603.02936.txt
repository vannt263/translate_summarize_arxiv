    "circulators are important passive nonreciprocal components which are used both in microwave and optical frequency region .",
    "these devices permit mitigate the harmful influence of reflections on the sources of electromagnetic waves . in microwaves ,",
    "the most popular circulators are based on waveguide and microstrip technology with magnetized ferrite elements @xcite .",
    "optical circulators have been also discussed in literature @xcite .    in thz region ,",
    "one of the promising tendencies is graphene technology which allows one , in particular , to construct nonreciprocal devices .",
    "recently , an interesting idea of an edge - guided graphene circulator was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the device consists of multi - layer graphene - dielectric waveguides and this can complicate its production technology .    in this paper , we suggest a graphene circulator with a very simple structure which can be used in thz and infrared frequency region .",
    "it consists of graphene nanostrip waveguides connected to a graphene circular resonator .",
    "the schematic representation of the circulator is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1]a and [ figure1]b .",
    "the width of the waveguides are @xmath0 nm and @xmath1 , that are connected to a circular graphene resonator with the radius @xmath2 nm . the waveguides and the resonator are placed on a lossless dielectric substrate of silicon and silica with the thickness @xmath3 200 nm and @xmath4 600 nm , with relative permittivity @xmath5 11.9 and @xmath5 2.09 , respectively .",
    "is dc magnetic field . ]    in numerical simulations by the commercial software comsol @xcite , we have used the following parameters of the graphene conductivity tensor @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the drude weight , @xmath8 is the miminum conductivity of graphene , @xmath9 is related to chemical potential of graphene @xmath10 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath11 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 is the relaxation time , @xmath14 is the frequency of the incident wave and @xmath15 .    for numerical proposition",
    ", graphene is modeled as a bulk material with a bulk conductivity tensor given by @xmath16 = [ \\sigma_s]/\\delta$ ] , being @xmath17 $ ] the surface conductiviry tensor , which its component are given by ( [ eq : sig1])-([eq : sig2 ] ) , and @xmath18 is the thickness of the graphene . in all calculations @xmath19 nm .",
    "it is well known that graphene stips can suport two kinds of guided surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) modes , namelly a guide mode and edge mode , which are discussed in details in @xcite . in our case",
    ", we have chosen the former one , once the eletromagnetic field in that mode is concentrated in the center of the ribbon , as shown in the insert in fig [ fig : neff ] .",
    "the dependence of effective refractive index for different values of frequency , with respect to width of the geraphene ribbon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neff ] .     profile of guided mode in graphene strip . ]    in the following , the transmission coefficient @xmath20 of a signal injected in port @xmath21 and received by port @xmath22 was calculated .",
    "the percentage bandwidth of circulator is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the limit frequency value so that the transmission level on a transmission port remain above - 2 db and the isolation level on the isolation port remain below - 15 db at the same time .",
    "@xmath26 is the central frequency of operation .",
    "the working principle of the circulator is similar to that of the microstrip one .",
    "the guided spp wave in the input waveguide excites in the circular resonator in the non - magnetic state two degenerate clockwise @xmath27 and anticlockwise @xmath28 rotating modes .",
    "these two modes produce a dipole aligned to the input waveguide , which leads to a transmission in both output ports , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : desdob]a . a dc magnetic bias of @xmath29 t brakes the degenerency and makes the field pattern of the standing wave to rotate by 60@xmath30 aligning thus the node of dipole with the isolation of port 3 as shown in fig .",

    "the calculated frequency characteristics are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : s21s31 ] . at a central frequency of 8.23 thz",
    ", the device presents a transmission coefficient of -1.2 db , a isolation of -33 db , with a bandwidth of 6.98 % in a transmission level of -2 db and a isolation level of -15 db .          by changing chemical potential of graphene",
    ", one can change the carrier density in the ribbon , and consequently , the values of the conductivity tensor components .",
    "this leads to a possibility of dynamical control of the circulator responses .",
    "one can see from , fig .",
    "[ fig : mucdep ] , that the central frequency of circulator operation shifts to higher frequencies , when the chemical potencial increases .",
    "the opposite situation occurs by diminishing this value . besides by changing @xmath31 ,",
    "the values of the insertion losses and the bandwidth get worst than those for @xmath32 ev .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that the stationary dipole is not property aligned to the output port , but one can see that for values between 0.12 ev and 0.20 ev , these levels are acceptable , as shown in the same figure .",
    "in this work we have suggested and confirmed by numerical simulations a possibility of a controllable three - port circulator graphene - based circulator . this component with a very simple structure",
