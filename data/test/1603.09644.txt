    "the idea behind the sp was put forward by efetov in 1979 in the context of layered superconductor with parallel magnetic field @xcite . it was suggested that the field can suppress the inter - layer josephson coupling so that the low energy properties of this 3d system can be described as being essentially of 2d character .",
    "later , in ref . @xcite it was shown that the frustration due to the magnetic field is not sufficient to fully suppress the coupling .    in the context of quantum 1d chains ( equivalent to 2d classical layers by the virtue of the quantum to classical mapping ) the possibility of the decoupling between chains",
    "has also been explored @xcite . the main argument for such a decoupling",
    "is based on the scaling dimensions of the josephson coupling determined with respect to the luttinger liquid parameter in each chain : if it is larger than 2 , the coupling should become irrelevant @xcite .",
    "these proposals have been criticized in refs.@xcite where it was shown that the inter - chain tunneling is always relevant .    further argumentation in favor of the sp and , actually , the name _ sliding phases _ have been proposed in refs.@xcite where the inter - layer gradient couplings between classical xy variables in each layer have been considered in addition to the josephson one .",
    "such gradient terms can independently control the scaling dimensions of the josephson coupling and of the vortex fugacity in each layer so that the first one can become irrelevant above some temperature @xmath0 ( of the _ dimensional reduction _",
    "@xcite ) which is below the temperature of the berizinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition in the layers .",
    "thus , there is a range of temperatures where the sp are supposed to exist .",
    "this approach was also developed for the case of quantum 1d luttinger liquids coupled by both the josephson and the gradient terms @xcite which are the analog of the andreev - bashkin drag effect @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the proposal of sp is based on applying the rg logic to compact variables characterized by global u(1 ) symmetry . while these early suggestions were more of a purely academic interest ,",

    "the dual formulation in terms of the closed loops of integer j - currents ( along bonds in and between the layers ) can be achieved similarly to the case @xmath135 by reinstating the compactness of @xmath191 in eqs.([nnz],[hnnz ] ) through the villain approach : @xmath228 along the planes and @xmath229 for josephson coupling , where @xmath230 refers to an arbitrary ( oriented ) integer defined on the bond @xmath231 belonging to the plane @xmath131 and @xmath232 stands for an integer on a bond connecting site @xmath90 in the plane @xmath131 to the same site in the plane @xmath233 .",

    "the j - currents enter through the poisson identity @xmath235 applied to each bond integer .",

    "there are two types of j - currents : inplane @xmath237 within each `` elementary cell '' ( along @xmath131 ) and between the planes @xmath238 .",

    "we will repeat it here .",
    "the loop formation can be viewed as a process of random walks of two ends of a broken loop ",
    "exactly along the line of the worm algorithm @xcite .",
    "such a walk of each end is controlled by energetics of creating one bond element @xmath249 in a randomly chosen direction  either along a given plane or perpendicular to it . very similar to the case of the two layers , the energy to create such an element alone along the odd layer costs energy @xmath250 , while the same element along an even layer costs energy @xmath251 .",
    "the only option for creating a loop in an odd layer is if its energy is compensated by parallel elements in the even plane .",
    "this feature is caused by the strong current - current interaction @xmath252 .",
    "thus , if the walk occurs along @xmath131-direction from some even layer @xmath131 toward the neighboring odd layer @xmath233 , the subsequent move along the odd layer will be too energetically costly so that the walker would either move further toward @xmath253 layer or will go back to the original layer @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the inter - layer elements are characterized by either @xmath254 or @xmath255 .",
    "the weight of such a process is either @xmath256 or @xmath257 , respectively .",
    "even if the walker makes a step or two along the layer @xmath233 ( which is a highly improbable event ) and then chooses to go toward the layer @xmath253 , the contribution to the partition function will be further reduced exponentially by the energy of the element @xmath258 along the odd plane .",
    "thus , such processes can be ignored , and we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath2 given by eq.([ur3 ] ) must be valid for arbitrary @xmath125 in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the model ( [ hdual ] ) has been simulated by the worm algorithm @xcite .",
    "the renormalized inter - layer stiffness @xmath2 was found for a wide range of layer sizes , @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "the resulting data is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig3],[fig4 ] . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the solution ( [ ur3 ] ) plays the role of the envelop for the family of the curves @xmath2 vs @xmath261 for various @xmath3 and @xmath262 .",
    "we note that the stiffness @xmath263 along the layers ( as determined by eq.([stif22 ] ) ) remains independent of the sizes and much larger ( @xmath264 ) than @xmath2 .",
    "this justifies the applicability of the asymptotic limit for eq.([ur3 ] ) .",
    "we have also controlled that the system is far enough from any possible composite phases @xcite state by measuring the lowest order correlator @xmath265 and observing that it exhibits long - range order for values @xmath266 in the limit @xmath267.[in the composite phase state such a correlator is short ranged ] .",
    "thus , the system is well in the putative sp state .",
    "its behavior , however , is drastically different from the rg prediction .",

    "there is , however , one important observation : the value of @xmath268 below which such suppression begins _ decreases _ as ( u^*)^-1 = ( l^2/n_z ) , = 1.000.02 [ ugm2 ] for @xmath269 in the main logarithmic approximation .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated in fig.[fig4 ] , where the value @xmath270 corresponds the offset for @xmath2 being taken at 1/10 of the value given by the analytical expression ( [ ur3 ] ) .",
    "the suppression of @xmath271 in the limit @xmath28 indicates that it is a finite size effect . in other words , starting from small @xmath3 at some @xmath272 , the renormalized stiffness @xmath2 can be well below the asymptotic limit ( [ ur3 ] ) .",
    "as @xmath3 increases while @xmath145 is kept fixed , @xmath2 eventually approaches the limit ( [ ur3 ] ) .",
    "this feature is clearly in a stark contrast with the rg prediction of sp where @xmath2 is supposed to flow to zero for fixed @xmath145 as a power of @xmath182 .",
    "the deviation from the limit ( [ ur3 ] ) has a very simple explanation : it is essentially a consequence of the generic exponential suppression of any order in a quasi-1d limit @xmath226 .",
    "[ there is no such suppression in the case of @xmath135 because the loops along z - direction are independent from the inplane ones ] . in the context of our system",
    "it can be interpreted as the effect of zero modes ( in each layer ) fluctuations .",
    "indeed , excitations along the planes renormalize @xmath145 to @xmath2 at short distances",
    ". then , as long as @xmath273 the only remaining lowest energy degrees of freedoms are zero modes , that is , excitations with @xmath274 being independent from the @xmath126 positions along the planes ( and dependent on @xmath131 ) .",
    "then , the effective action becomes s_0= -u_rl^2 _ z[(^(0)_z+1 - ^(0)_z ) ] .",
    "[ zero ] it should be used in the partition function @xmath275 .",
    "its analytical evaluation gives u^(0)_r ~ ( -n_z/(u_rl^2 ) ) [ zero ] for the value of the stiffness along @xmath131-direction  that is , the renormalised @xmath2 on large scale .",
    "keeping in mind that at short scales @xmath276 for @xmath156 , one arrives at the relation ( [ ugm2 ] ) with @xmath277 .",
    "it corresponds to the requirement @xmath278 for some @xmath268 so that eq.([zero ] ) describes the exponential suppression at @xmath279 .",
    "clearly , such a quasi-1d suppression is also present in the standard xy model ( where no sp are anticipated to exist ) . in order to demonstrate this",
    "explicitly we have also simulated a simple xy model given by the system z_xy&=&d _ z ( -h_xy ) , [ hxy ] + h_xy&=&- _ ij , z [ ( _ ij _ z ) + u ( _ z _ z ) ] , with some @xmath280 ( guaranteeing that no bkt transition occurs in each layer for @xmath35 ) , and @xmath281 . in the dual representation this system is described by h_xy _",
    "xy = _ ij , z j_z , ij^2 + _ i , z j_i , z^2 , [ hxy2 ] where @xmath282 and @xmath238 are the same j - currents introduced above for the model ( [ hdual ] ) .",
    "the results of the simulations of this model are presented in fig.[fig1],[fig2 ] . in the asymptotic limit",
    "the inter - layer stiffness is described by eq.([urxy ] ) .",
    "then , according to the above discussion the value @xmath270 determining the start of the deviations is given by @xmath283 , that is , with the slope @xmath284 which should be compared with the numerical value @xmath285 in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "thus , both models demonstrate essentially the same 3d behavior .",
    "the only difference is the slope of the renormalized josephson coupling @xmath286 vs its bare value @xmath145 .",
    "it is determined by the minimal length of the elementary j - current in the direction perpendicular to the layers .",
    "the rg approach to 2d systems proves to be every effective in many cases including 2d xy model when it can be mapped on the sine - gordon ( sg ) one @xcite .",
    "a successful implementation of the rg analysis to the josephson coupling was demonstrated in ref.@xcite where a single weak link can make one channel luttinger liquid insulating .",
    "the merit of rg , however , should be taken with caution when applied to the dimensional reduction situations in layered systems . in this case",
    "there is no exact mapping between xy and sg representations at finite inter - layer josephson coupling , and the approximation ignoring the compact nature of the variables becomes uncontrolled .",
    "as our analysis of one particular layered system shows , no sp exists in such a system despite the rg prediction : the system shows essentially the 3d behavior of the asymmetric xy model .",
    "while it is not obvious to us what is wrong with treating josephson coupling between 2d layers by rg in the original representation of fields , the dual formulation in terms of the closed loops gives a very important insight .",
    "specifically , the sp means that as layer size @xmath28 , a suppression of the josephson coupling between layers would require that the number of times elements of closed loops fluctuate between layers must scale slower than @xmath149 so that the density of such events is zero in the limit @xmath287 .",
    "the loops statistics , however , is controlled by local energies of creating finite elements and the entropy due to 6 directions in 3d vs 4 along layers .",
    "thus , as long as there is a finite energy to cross between neighboring layers , the entropy will lead to a finite density of crossings for large enough @xmath3 .",
    "similar argument can be applied to quantum wires in terms of the quantum to classical mapping where imaginary time is treated as an extra dimension .",
    "the dual approach and the argumentation along the line of the numerical algorithm @xcite , treating closed loops formation as a process of the worm head wondering around and eventually finding its tail , allowed us to expose the actual stages of the renormalization of the josephson coupling : i ) at small scales josephson coupling is controlled by exponentially suppressed random and independent ( in the asymptotic limit ) events of crossings between layers .",
    "it can be viewed as an ideal gas of j - currents between the layers .",
    "this stage leads to the renormalized coupling , in general , represented by eq.([genm ] ) with @xmath288 .",
    "ii ) if the number of layers @xmath125 increases , with @xmath3 being fixed , quasi 1d fluctuations further suppress the coupling exponentially as demonstrated in eq.([zero ] ) .",
    "here we have discussed a local model characterized by short range interactions between the inter - layer j - current elements .",
    "this feature in combination with the low density of such elements justifies the `` ideal gas '' approximation for them , which in its turn leads to finite values of the renormalized inter - layer josephson coupling .",
    "the question may be raised if a presence of long - range forces between the inter - plane j - currents @xmath134 can change the situation and lead to the sp or its weaker version  where @xmath289 with the growing number of layers @xmath125 in the limit @xmath287 . in this respect we note that in order to realize this , fluctuations of the difference of the j - currents with positive and negative orientations must be macroscopically suppressed . in this case",
    "the fluctuation of the winding numbers in @xmath131-direction @xmath290 will scale slower than @xmath149 so that @xmath291 .",
    "this may be caused by interactions between the inter - layer j - currents decaying not faster than the second power of their separation .",
    "more specifically , the following additional repulsive term h_sp=_i , j u(_i -_j ) j_i j_j [ spx ] in the simple xy j - current model ( [ hxy2 ] ) with @xmath292 having the long range tail @xmath293 with @xmath294 will generate the energy contribution @xmath295 in terms of the windings in z - direction . consequently , the renormalized josephson coupling ( [ wu ] ) would scale as @xmath296 .",
    "in one particular example long - range forces are introduced into the inter - layer josephson in the standard xy model ( [ hxy ] ) by some effective gauge - type term @xmath297 , where @xmath298 refers to the derivatives along the layers of some soft mode @xmath299 , with @xmath300 being a parameter .",
    "the resulting interaction in the dual form ( [ spx ] ) becomes @xmath301 and , thus , it suppresses the inter - layer josephson as @xmath302 in the limit @xmath28 for fixed @xmath125 .",
