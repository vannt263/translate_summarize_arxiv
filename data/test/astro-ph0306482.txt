    "another possibility is that some neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been proposed as a source of radiation emission for cosmological @xmath11-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "strange quark matter is filled with electromagnetic waves in thermodynamic equilibrium with quarks .",
    "photon emissivity is the basic parameter for determining macroscopic properties of objects made of strange matter . @xcite",
    "have shown that , because of very high plasma frequency near the strange matter edge , photon emissivity of strange matter is very low . for temperatures @xmath12 , where @xmath13 mev is the characteristic transverse plasmon cuttof energy ,",
    "the equilibrium photon emissivity of strange matter is negligible small , compared to the black body one .",
    "the dispersion relation of the electromagnetic waves in quark matter can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the frequency of the waves , @xmath16 is their wave number , @xmath17 is the plasma frequency , with @xmath18 the baryon number density of strange quark matter and @xmath19 is the chemical potential of the quarks ( usov 1998 ) .",
    "propagating modes exist only for @xmath20 .",

    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of quark matter has been estimated by @xcite .",
    "they have found that the surface radiation is about four orders of magnitude weaker than the equilibrium black body radiation , even they both have the same temperature dependence .",
    "the structure of a realistic strange star is very complicated , but its basic properties can be described as follows @xcite .",
    "beta - equilibrated strange quark - star matter consists of an approximately equal mixture of up @xmath27 , down @xmath28 and strange @xmath29 quarks , with a slight deficit of the latter .",
    "the fermi gas of @xmath30 quarks constitutes a single color - singlet baryon , with baryon number @xmath31 .",
    "this structure of the quarks leads to a net positive charge inside the star .",
    "since stars in their lowest energy state are supposed to be charge neutral , electrons must balance the net positive quark charge in strange matter stars .",
    "the electrons , being bounded to the quark matter by the electromagnetic interaction and not by the strong force , are able to move freely across the quark surface , but clearly can not move to infinity because of the electrostatic attraction of quarks .",

    "moreover , as shown by @xcite , the thermal luminosity from the star surface , due to both photon emission and @xmath33 pair production may be , for about one day for normal quark matter and for up to a hundred years for superconducting quark matter , orders of magnitude higher than the eddington limit .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to reconsider the problem of the photon emissivity , via bremsstrahlung radiation , of the quark stars .",
    "equilibrium radiation , transmitted through the surface , is dominant at temperatures @xmath37 k , while below this temperature the bremsstrahlung radiation from the surface layer prevails .",
    "hence bremsstrahlung is the main source of radiation for cold quark stars .",
    "this electromagnetic radiation is generated in the dense medium at the stellar surface in which extremely relativistic quarks move . in the 1950 s @xcite",
    "predicted that the cross section for bremsstrahlung from highly relativistic particles in dense media is suppressed , due to the interference between amplitudes of nearby interactions .",
    "the suppression has its roots in the uncertainty principle .",
    "the kinematics of the bremsstrahlung requires that the longitudinal momentum transfer between the fixed and the scattered particles must be small . on the other hand",
    "the uncertainty principle requires that the interaction must occur over a large longitudinal distance scale ( formation zone ) . if the charged particle coulomb scatters while traversing this zone , the bremsstrahlung amplitude from before and after the scattering can interfere , reducing the amplitude for photon emission @xcite .",
    "this effect has been recently confirmed experimentally for the bremsstrahlung emission of electrons in different materials at a 5% accuracy level @xcite .",
    "since the surface of the quark star consists of a very dense medium , with density of the order @xmath38 , multiple collisions of the electromagnetically radiating particle lead to a significant suppression of the quark - quark bremsstrahlung . by adopting a simple model for the elastic scattering of quarks , we derive the spectrum of the classical bremsstrahlung radiation and the emissivity of the quark matter , by considering the multiple scattering effects in the electromagnetic radiation of quark matter . for the range of densities existing at the surfaces of strange stars , which are higher than the nuclear density",
    ", the landau - pomeranchuk effect could reduce the bremsstrahlung emissivity of quark matter by an order of magnitude .",
    "photon emissivity of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is conjectured to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , has been extensively investigated recently ( for a recent review of direct photon emission from qgp , including comparisons of theoretical predictions with experiments see peitzmann & thoma ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "photons and dilepton pairs only interact electromagnetically and their mean free paths are much larger than the size of the qgp .",
    "hence these electromagnetic probes leave the hot and dense qgp without further scattering , thus providing important informations about the early stages of the collision and the structure of the qgp . as sources of direct photons",
    "one can consider quark annihilation , compton scattering and bremsstrahlung following the initial hard scattering of partons of the nuclei , as well as thermal photons from the qgp and from hadronic interactions in the hot hadronic gas after the hadronization of the plasma ( peitzmann & thoma 2002 ) .",
    "the first observation of direct photon production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been reported by the wa98 collaboration in @xmath39 collisions at @xmath40 gev at the super proton synchrotron at cern ( aggarwal et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the results display a clear excess of direct photons above the expected background from hadronic decays in the range of transverse momentum @xmath41 gev@xmath42 in the most central collisions .",
    "these experimental findings provide a confirmation of the feasibility of direct photons as reliable probes in heavy ion collisions and may pave the way for the understanding of the formation and evolution of the qgp .",
    "the evaluation of the photo - emission rate from the qgp was initiated by kapusta et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and by baier et al .",
    ". however , as shown by aurenche et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , these initial estimations were incomplete , since the bremsstrahlung and inelastic pair annihilation processes contains collinear enhancements which cause them to contribute at the same parametric order in the coupling as the two to two processes even for large photon energies .",
    "but these calculations are also incomplete , as they did not incorporate the suppression of photon emission due to multiple scatterings during the photon emission process , which limits the coherence length of the emitted radiation ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ) . the rate of photo - production by bremsstrahlung and inelastic pair annihilation in a hot , equilibrated plasma at zero chemical potential , fully including the lpm effect , was calculated , to leading orders in both the electromagnetic and strong coupling constants , by ( arnold , moore & jaffe 2001 , arnold , moore & jaffe 2002 ) .",
    "the emission of hard photons from the qgp plasma , using a model based on the thermodynamics of qcd , and the determination of the initial temperature of the expanding fireball has been considered recently by renk ( 2003 ) .",
    "the radiation emitted by the quark layer at the surface of the quark star must also cross the thin electron layer extending beyond the star s surface .",
    "we also consider the effect of this layer on the outgoing radiation and show that it can significantly reduce the intensity of the radiation coming from the quark star .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect for quark matter .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emissivity of quark matter is considered in section iii .",
    "the effect of the electron layer on the radiation outgoing from the quark star surface is analyzed in section iv . in section",
    "v we discuss and conclude our results . throughout this paper we use units so that @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the dispersion relation shows that only photons with frequency @xmath45 can propagate inside strange matter .",
    "propagation of electromagnetic waves of frequencies lower than @xmath46 is exponentially damped , with the damping coefficient @xmath47 depending on @xmath15 and @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath48 the value of @xmath47 is given by @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this means that photons with @xmath50 emitted in various processes inside strange matter are absorbed .",
    "the mean free path of such a photon is of the order of @xmath51 fm @xcite .",
    "therefore , only photons produced just below the surface with momenta pointing outwards can leave strange matter .    in the following",
    "we shall consider the photon emissivity of quark matter , by also taking into account the effect of multiple scatterings on the emitted radiation .",
    "this effect is called the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , and was considered initially by @xcite , who used classical electrodynamics to demonstrate bremsstrahlung suppression due to multiple scattering : the suppression comes from the interference between photons emitted by different elements of the charged particle trajectory . to study the astrophysical implications of this effect on quark matter we shall take into account the bremsstrahlung photons produced in the quark - quark interactions , that is in the process @xmath52 .",
    "the lpm effect can be discussed in a simple qualitative way as follows .",
    "let s consider a bremsstrahlung photon of energy @xmath15 produced by an ultrarelativistic quark of energy @xmath53 and mass @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "in this kinematic regime the average angle @xmath56 between the incident quark and the produced photon is small , @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that the angle between the incident and scattered quark is also small .",
    "moreover , we shall assume that all quarks have the same density dependent effective mass @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the quark particle number densities .",
    "neglecting the scattering and quark - photon angles , it follows that the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath62 to the static quark is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty principle then requires that the spatial position of the bremsstrahlung process has a longitudinal uncertainty of @xmath65 . in alternate language ,",
    "the quark and photon slowly split apart over the distance @xmath66 . in a sufficiently dense medium",
    "the quark mean free path is much less than @xmath66 ; in the lpm effect the relevant interaction is multiple scattering .",
    "bremsstrahlung is suppressed when the mean square multiple scattering angle over the distance @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 ^{-1}$ ] , with @xmath71 , is the radiation length , is greater than or equal to @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "therefore the bremsstrahlung differential cross section for the production of a photon is suppressed when @xmath74 , where @xmath75 @xcite . by assuming that the temperature of the star @xmath76 , with @xmath77 the fermi momentum , the fermi distribution factors force all the quarks to have @xmath78 . for an extreme relativistic quark gas @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the statistical weight for quark matter .",
    "therefore the critical lpm frequency for bremsstrahlung photon emission in quark matter is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "for strange quark matter @xmath83 .",
    "emission of the bremsstrahlung radiation with frequency smaller than @xmath84 is suppressed , due to the effect of multiple scattering .",
    "as expected , the lpm frequency increases with the density of the strange matter .",
    "the variation of @xmath85 as a function of the particle number density is represented , for different values of the strong coupling constant @xmath59 , in fig .  1 .",
    "the most important parameter characterizing the lpm effect is the average time between two collisions , denoted @xmath86 .",
    "it can be calculated from @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the density of the medium which depends on its composition and on temperature @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 denotes the cross section of a test particle having velocity @xmath90 and interacting with the particles of the medium .",
    "thus generally @xmath86 is a function of the temperature and density of the medium and of the momentum of the test particle .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is essential for the importance of the lpm effect : if @xmath91 is zero ( @xmath92 ) , the effect is absent @xcite .    the starting point for the rigorous implementation of the lpm effect",
    "is the following textbook equation for the energy radiated per unit momentum by the charged particle @xcite , @xmath93 } \\vec{n}\\times \\vec{v}_{l}dt\\right| ^{2 } ,   \\label{1a}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 describes the trajectory of the charged particle , @xmath95 is its velocity , @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the fine structure constant and @xmath98 is the charge of @xmath99 quarks .",

    "as the quark gas is taken to be in thermal equilibrium , many possible velocities can result in between two collisions .",
    "for this reason the non - diagonal terms in the above equation will give zero contribution after one averages over all velocities , providing of course that no correlation exists between the velocity before and after the collision .",
    "only the diagonal terms remain in this case .",
    "the time between two successive collisions is given by @xmath108 .",

    "the averaging over the time between two collisions can be done with the use of the mathematical identity @xmath114 .",

    "the multiple scattering of the quarks change the quark path and affect the emission of the radiation .",
    "if @xmath121 is the initial velocity of the quark at the moment @xmath122 , then at the moment @xmath123 its velocity will be @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a unit vector perpendicular to the initial direction of motion and @xmath126 is the electron multiple scattering in the time interval @xmath127 to @xmath123 @xcite . @xcite took @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , in this approximation we obtain @xmath129 . over a distance @xmath130 the multiple scattering",

    "@xmath133 is given as a root of a quadratic equation : @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the classical suppression length @xcite .",
    "in the case of the standard approach to the bremsstrahlung radiation of charged particles , one assumes that the energy is emitted in a single collision .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) , by taking @xmath136 and @xmath137 , it immediately follows that the single collision spectral distribution of the bremsstrahlung radiation @xmath138 is given by @xcite @xmath139    the total intensity is proportional to the frequency of the emitted radiation and is independent on the medium in which the motion of the particle takes place .",
    "the same result can be derived by taking the limit @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) : @xmath141    in the opposite limit of very high density , corresponding to @xmath142 , from eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) we obtain @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the electromagnetic radiation from a quark moving in a very dense medium is completely suppressed .",
    "to calculate the bremsstrahlung emissivity a sensible model for quark interactions has to be used .",
    "we adopt the basic assumption that the details of the interaction should be relatively unimportant , as long as the overall strength is correct and the relevant symmetries are respected . hence we use the well - known nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in its @xmath145 version in our calculations @xcite .",

    "are neglected .",
    "let @xmath146 be the cross - section for a given process of scattering of charged particles , which may be accompanied by the emission of a certain number of photons .",
    "for example , @xmath146 could refer to the scattering of a quark by an other quark , with the possible emission of hard photons .",
    "together with this process one could consider another process which differs from it only in that one extra photon is emitted . in this case",
    "the total cross - section @xmath147 can be represented as a product of two independent factors , the cross - section @xmath146 and the probability @xmath148 of emission of a single photon in the collision @xcite .",
    "the emission of a soft photon is a quasi - classical process .",
    "the probability of emission is the same as the classically calculated number of quanta emitted in the collision , that is the same as the classical intensity ( total energy ) of emission @xmath149 , divided by the frequency of the radiation @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "hence as a first step in obtaining the bremsstrahlung emissivity of quark matter we have to calculate the classical radiation intensity emitted by a quark moving in a dense medium in which many inter - particle collisions occur .",
    "the probability @xmath148 of emitting a photon of energy @xmath15 by any of the scattered quarks is @xmath150 .",

    "the applicability of the formulas for the spectral distribution and intensity of the bremsstrahlung radiation we have derived in the previous section is limited by the quantum condition that @xmath15 be small as compared with the total kinetic energy of the quark , which is of the order of @xmath177 : @xmath178 .",
    "since at the star s surface the kinetic energy of the quarks is of the order of @xmath179 mev , the radiation formulae are valid only for frequencies @xmath180 mev . in order to find the maximum frequency @xmath181 of the radiation in the ultrarelativistic case",

    "<S> we consider the bremsstrahlung surface photon emissivity of strange quark stars , by sistematically taking into account the effects of the multiple scatterings of the highly relativistic quarks in a dense medium ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ) . due to interference between amplitudes of nearby interactions the bremsstrahlung emissivity from strange star surface </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed for frequencies smaller than a critical frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the range of the suppressed frequencies is a function of the quark matter density at the star s surface and of the qcd coupling constant . for temperatures much smaller than the fermi energy of the quarks </S>",
    "<S> the bremsstrahlung spectrum has the same temperature dependence as the equilibrium black body radiation . </S>",
    "<S> multiple collisions could reduce by an order of magnitude the intensity of the bremsstrahlung radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the thin electron layer at the surface of the quark star on the bremsstrahlung spectrum is also analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that absorption in the semi - degenerate electron gas can also significantly reduce the intensity of the quark - quark bremsstrahlung radiation and , consequently , the surface emissivity . </S>",
    "<S> hence the combined effects of multiple collisions and absorption in the electron layer could make the soft photon surface radiation of quark stars six orders of magnitude smaller than the equilibrium black body radiation . </S>"
