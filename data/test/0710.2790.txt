    "recently , there is a lot of interest in the studies of thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter using the polyakov loop enhanced nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite .",
    "this model couples the chiral and deconfinement order parameters through a simple - minded coupling of the njl model @xcite with the polyakov loop model @xcite .",
    "the two major thrusts in recent times have been to estimate various thermodynamic observables using this model ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and to make systematic improvements of the model @xcite .",
    "another set of important result has come from similar studies in chiral quark models that go beyond the mean field treatment @xcite .    in this note",
    "we deal with the improvement of the polyakov loop model and describe some of its consequences , remaining within the domain of mean field analysis .",
    "the polyakov loop model used in many of the recent literature is the one given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath1 has been treated here as a z(3 ) spin field @xcite . using this model we estimated @xcite a very sensitive observable - the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) and also the higher order coefficients in the taylor expansion of pressure in quark number chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "comparison with the data from lattice qcd ( lqcd ) @xcite showed that the qns in the pnjl model and lqcd agree quite well both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the fourth order coefficient @xmath3 showed qualitative agreement but had a quantitative difference at high temperatures .",
    "some of us further extended the pnjl model to include isospin chemical potential @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the isospin number susceptibility ( ins ) and its derivative with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath4 were obtained . in this case",
    "the fourth order derivative @xmath5 was quite consistent with lattice data , but the ins was not .",
    "a possible reason for such departures is that the mean - field treatment of the pnjl model is insufficient .",
    "but then it should have affected the coefficients systematically , all the fourth order coefficients should deviate further from lqcd data than the second order coefficients .",
    "there are however other _",
    "simpler _ reasons that should be considered first .",
    "the pnjl model is only a model which can mimic some of the characteristics of a fundamental theory like qcd and its discretized version lqcd .",
    "moreover , the parameters like the couplings and masses are quite different in the pnjl model and the lqcd simulations .",
    "thus some quantitative difference is naturally expected .",
    "apart from these we made an important observation in @xcite that @xmath1 has a big role to play in the behaviour of these coefficients .",
    "we pointed out how the quantitative differences could be caused by the behaviour of @xmath1 as a function of temperature and chemical potentials .",
    "the most important _ physical problem _ in the simple - minded pnjl model is the following .",
    "@xmath1 being the normalized trace of the wilson line @xmath6 , which is an su(3 ) matrix , should lie in the range @xmath7 .",
    "but it was found to be greater than 1 at temperatures above 2@xmath0 ( see fig.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the natural way to cure this problem is to consider a proper jacobian of transformation from the matrix valued field @xmath8 to the complex valued field @xmath1 which will then constrain the value of @xmath1 to @xmath9 .",
    "this is quite a well known construction in su(n ) matrix model ( see e.g.@xcite ) , in certain variations of polyakov loop model ( @xcite ) , as well as in qcd motivated phenomenological models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also this is ubiquitous in various strong coupling effective theories of lattice qcd ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    here",
    "we introduce the vandermonde term in the polyakov loop model in a conceptually different way than that in the earlier models . in the next section",
    "we discuss our approach . in section iii",
    "we show the changes in measurements of the susceptibilities and various other quantities due to the vdm term .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "at a temperature @xmath10 , the su(3 ) wilson line is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gauge coupling , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 = 1,2, ... 8 ) are the time - like components of the gluon field , @xmath15 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath16 the imaginary time in the euclidian field theory . the polyakov loop is defined as @xmath17 and its conjugate is @xmath18 . since @xmath6 is itself a su(3 )",
    "matrix so @xmath19 . the gluon thermodynamics can be described as an effective theory of the polyakov loops @xcite . on the other hand quark thermodynamics can be effectively described in terms of njl model @xcite , and the two are coupled to obtain the pnjl model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the thermodynamic potential in this model can be obtained in terms of the sigma and pion condensates and the thermal average of the polyakov loop .",
    "however the version of the pnjl model @xcite leads to @xmath20 for @xmath21 . to rectify this anomaly , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a complete modification of the polyakov loop model @xcite , motivated from the strong coupling results used by fukushima @xcite our aim in this work is also similar , but the approach is somewhat different .",
    "we retain the polyakov loop potential of @xcite but treat it as a matrix model . also the way we define pressure is quite different as discussed below .",
    "we first outline our scheme using an arbitrary matrix model for the wilson line @xmath6 , which for simplicity is assumed to be a potential @xmath22 \\equiv { { \\cal v}}[\\phi,\\bar{\\phi}]$ ] . in the following equation , we express the partition function for this theory first as a path integral over @xmath6 and then over the fields @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",

    "@xcite ) from @xmath6 to ( @xmath26 ) , and is given as @xmath25 \\equiv ( 27/24\\pi^2 ) ( 1 - 6\\,\\bar{\\phi }",
    "\\phi + 4\\,(\\bar{\\phi}^3 + \\phi^3 )   - 3\\,(\\bar{\\phi } \\phi)^2)$ ] .",
    "our interest then would be to obtain the pressure which is given by ,    p = t = - - v [ eq.prest ]    where , @xmath27 denotes the physical volume of the system and @xmath28 denotes thermal averaging .",
    "the last approximation holds in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the role of the jacobian is to be understood as follows .",
    "first , it is a factor reweighting the field configurations and hence significantly affects all thermal averages .",
    "however the jacobian is not explicitly space - time dependent , there is no extra term to be averaged in eqn .",
    "[ eq.prest ] as one might expect when redefining the path integration from @xmath6 to @xmath1 ( eqn . [ eq.inttrace ] to eqn .",
    "[ eq.intmes ] ) .",
    "a typical example of such a dependence would be if we were considering say a fourier transform of the fields . in case of a free field this kind of dependence of the jacobian on the volume and temperature is very important in obtaining the correct partition function .",
    "thus , in our mean field treatment we have to carefully incorporate the effect of the jacobian and this is the main aim of this paper .",
    "the effect of the jacobian is reflected in the mean fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and we express the pressure as ,    p = - v ( , ) .    to relate to pure glue theory",
    ", we now replace the potential density @xmath31 by a landau - ginzburg type functional @xmath32 , given by@xcite ,    = -| - ( ^3 + |^3)+ ( | ) ^2  , [ eq.uu ]    with    b_2(t)=a_0+a_1 ( ) + a_2 ( ) ^2+a_3()^3  .",
    "[ eq.bb ]    0.15 in    to make a saddle point approximation to the mean fields , the potential density @xmath32 was minimized w.r.t . @xmath1 and @xmath23 in ref .",
    "these were then used to obtain pressure @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 ( @xmath35=0,1,2,3 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37=2,3,4 ) were fitted from lattice data of pressure in pure gauge theory , and @xmath38 is precisely the transition temperature @xmath39 mev @xcite . as @xmath40 , @xmath41 . however , to take care of the effect of the jacobian as discussed above , we now propose to minimize the following modified potential ,    = - , [ eq.uup ]    where @xmath42 is a dimensionless parameter to be determined phenomenologically . the mean field value of pressure is still obtained from the relation @xmath33 . a very simple example of this approach is demonstrated in the appendix .",
    "note that the jacobian term is considered as an extra effective term in the modified potential density implying a sort of normalized volume factor .",
    "this is quite natural as the form of eqn .",
    "[ eq.intmes ] implies that there is a jacobian sitting at each and every space - time coordinate , depending on the value of @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "0.15 in    with the new minimization condition all the coefficients should be estimated afresh .",
    "instead , we retain the values of @xmath34 and @xmath36 obtained in @xcite and tune only the values of @xmath38 and @xmath42 .",
    "this is equivalent to a correlated modification of the @xmath34 and @xmath36 keeping @xmath38 fixed at 270 mev .",
    "we show the variation of the polyakov loop and the pressure @xmath43 normalized to stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) pressure @xmath44 for pure gauge theory , as a function of temperature . in fig.[fg.purek ] we have used a small non - zero constant value of @xmath45 . in fig.[fg.purek3 ] we find similar behaviour for a temperature dependent @xmath46 . in both the figures the @xmath47 curves are for the polyakov loop model without the vdm term .",
    "thus the parameter space of @xmath42 is quite open at this stage .    within the range of temperatures ( @xmath48 ) where the polyakov loop model is supposed to be a good description of the system , our approach and that of ref . @xcite",
    "give similar results .",
    "the reason behind this is that one can suitably adjust the parameters in both approaches .",
    "however , our method for introducing the vdm potential as discussed above , is very much different from that of ref .",
    "the main difference is that the pressure computed in ref .",
    "@xcite includes the vdm term .",
    "thus the coefficient of the vdm term requires an inverse temperature dependence , so that on a naive extrapolation to high temperatures , the pressure does not blow up with the logarithm of the jacobian . in that case",
    "another problem crops up with the remaining part of the thermodynamic potential , which at high temperatures has no bound , contrary to the claim that @xmath49 as @xmath40 .",
    "precisely because @xmath1 should go to 1 as @xmath40 we believe that the vdm term should be very important at high temperatures to constrain the maximum value of @xmath1 to 1 .",
    "the exercise for introducing a vdm term for the polyakov loop model itself has nothing new to offer .",
    "even without it the potential @xmath32 was able to describe the pure glue theory quite well .",
    "however its importance becomes evident in the pnjl model .",
    "the polyakov loop has a coupling to the fermionic part as will be seen in the corresponding thermodynamic potential below , which forces the @xmath1 to be greater than 1 , and more so as the chemical potential is increased .",
    "the vdm term can inhibit such a behaviour .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the pnjl model @xcite is given as ,    & = & u(,|,t)+ 2 g_1(_u^2 + _ d^2 ) + 4 g_2 _ u _ d + & - & _ f = u , d 2 t \\ { .",

    "[ omega ] here quark condensates for the two light flavors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , and the respective chemical potentials are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the quasi - particle energies are @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the constituent quark masses and @xmath60 is the current quark mass ( we assume flavour degeneracy ) . @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the effective coupling strengths of a local , chiral symmetric four - point interaction .",
    "we take @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the coupling used in ref .",
    "@xmath65 is the 3-momentum cutoff in the njl model .",
    "@xmath66 is the effective potential for @xmath1 and @xmath23 as given in eqn .",
    "[ eq.uu ] .",
    "we locate the transition temperature in this model from the peaks in the temperature variation of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "similar to the case of the polyakov loop model we would now obtain the mean fields by minimizing , = - [ eq.omegap ]    the coefficient @xmath42 in the vdm term can in general have some temperature and/or chemical potential dependence . here",
    "we take a constant value @xmath69 which suffices for the purpose of the present work . to set this value we looked at the two important quantities affected by the vdm term .",
    "first one is @xmath1 which decreases with the increase of @xmath42 and hence decreases the pressure .",
    "second one is the transition temperature which increases with @xmath42 .",
    "thus we try to optimize @xmath42 to get both the pressure and the transition temperature as close as possible to the lqcd results for two quark flavours .    on a naive extrapolation of this model to large chemical potentials , the @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath23 should grow towards 1 ( deconfinement at large chemical potential ) even at very low temperatures .",
    "thus again the logarithmic term blows up .",
    "so if pressure is computed including the vdm term as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , an anomalous logarithmic divergence would come up .",
    "there may be some new physics that can obscure such terms by making @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "but that would again run into a problem in restricting @xmath1 in the domain @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the difference in the treatment of the vdm term we would now remove the condition @xmath72 used in @xcite , since it has important implications for susceptibilities .    before going over to our results let us take a digression to the lattice computation of @xmath1 . on the lattice @xmath1",
    "is computed from the relation @xcite ,    \\(t ) = ( -f_q |q(,t)/2 t ) , [ eq.screen ]    where , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the free energy of a pair of heavy quark and anti - quark at a separation @xmath75 at a temperature @xmath10 .",
    "this has been used to define a renormalized polyakov loop in lattice simulations of both pure gluon @xcite and full qcd @xcite .",
    "in fact the data of @xcite was used to obtain the different parameters of the polyakov loop model in @xcite , and is being used by us here , and in that sense @xmath1 is the renormalized polyakov loop .",
    "but even in this exercise the @xmath1 in the polyakov loop model of @xcite goes to 1 at large t and is thus different from lattice results for @xmath76 . on the lattice the value of @xmath1 goes above 1 for @xmath76 .",
    "it has been argued that since the @xmath1 measured in lattice simulations is a renormalized quantity , it is no more a character of the group su(3 ) and is thus not limited to values below 1 . from eqn.[eq.screen ] , it is evident that @xmath20 only when @xmath77 , and this can be very easily seen to be true in the lattice simulations and happens for @xmath76 .",
    "now , the free energy @xmath74 can be considered to be composed of three components , namely , a confining potential , a screening potential and an entropy part . for low temperatures",
    "the confining part is dominant and @xmath78 . in the deconfined phase for large distances ,",
    "the screening potential drops out so the entropy part is dominant which could lead to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 denotes the entropy of the system with a pair of quark and anti - quark .",
    "however the heavy quarks as such are not expected to contribute significantly to the entropy and it seems natural to have @xmath82 , and thus @xmath83 for @xmath76 .",
    "instead the value is negative on the lattice and @xmath84 as @xmath40 , leading to @xmath85 .",
    "one has to then worry about what can bend it down towards 1 at asymptotic temperatures as was observed by gava and jengo in perturbative evaluation of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however this perturbative calculation also points to the fact that as the temperature is lowered from asymptotic values the @xmath1 is greater than 1 .",
    "also recent continuum estimates in chiral quark models @xcite using dimensional reduction find close agreement with both lattice and perturbative calculations .    on the other hand another lattice computation of the polyakov loop in pure glue theory uses a renormalization dependent on temperature instead on the lattice spacing and finds the values to remain below 1 at least upto @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "we thus admit that the state of affairs with the lattice computation of @xmath1 is not very clear to us at this stage .",
    "there is a missing link from quantum computations to our matrix model mean - field computations .",

    "we have studied some thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter with the light flavours @xmath50 and @xmath51 within a certain range of temperature @xmath10 , and small values of chemical potentials @xmath2 and @xmath4 . in principle",
    "the vdm term affects all thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we adjusted the parameters in the model so that the pressure and energy density is close to that computed in lqcd .",
    "we have then made estimates of the specific heat , the speed of sound and conformal measure .",
    "further , we have extracted the taylor expansion coefficients of pressure in the two chemical potentials upto @xmath113-th order .",
    "all the coefficients approach their respective sb limit above @xmath108 .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the lqcd results show reasonable agreement , though the qns @xmath101 and the ins @xmath103 on the lattice are smaller by about 20 @xmath118 . in contrast",
    "our earlier estimates @xcite of these coefficients without the vdm term showed that @xmath3 and @xmath119 differ from the lqcd results .",
    "thus the main effect of the vdm term is to impose physical constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath23 such that at large temperatures the coefficients of the same order approach each other .",
    "this is clearly visible from the flavour off - diagonal coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ fg.diodi ] .",
    "the remaining difference of the values of the qns and ins in the model and lattice still needs to be addressed .",
    "possible future steps to bring in better agreement could be to include beyond mean field effects and/or to include some sort of temperature dependence to the coefficient of the vdm term .",
    "however the lattice quark masses may be important in bridging the gap .",
    "we already found that such data for pressure with almost physical quark masses @xcite show an increase at any given temperature when compared to data with larger quark masses @xcite .",
    "this would encourage us to believe that extraction of the susceptibilities with similar quark masses on the lattice may have a better agreement with our results .",
    "another way to compare results would be to re - estimate the parameters of the njl model directly from the pion mass and decay constants from the lattice .",
    "we hope to undertake such studies in future .    in an alternative formulation of the pnjl model including the effect of the vdm term , the coefficients @xmath101 , @xmath3 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 have been calculated @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we more or less agree with those results quantitatively . apart from the fact that this may be possible due to various adjustable parameters in both the models",
    ", the main reason seems to be the small dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath23 on the chemical potentials .",
    "the basic difference between the two approaches is in the use of the vdm potential .",
    "the vdm term is required to obtain the mean field solution of @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "but as we have explained in the formalism that it should not be included in the expression for pressure . on the other hand in ref .",
    "@xcite apart from obtaining the mean fields the vdm term is included while calculating the value of pressure .",
    "the difference in the mean field treatment coupled by almost same final results provide hints to the fact that mean field treatment has certain shortcomings and is unable to settle issues at hand",
    ". it would thus be worthwhile to look beyond .",
    "we would like to thank a. bhattacharya , s. datta , s. digal , s. gupta , s. mukherjee , p.b .",
    "pal and r. pisarski for many useful discussions and comments .",
    "we are thankful to a. dumitru and o. kaczmarek for useful discussions on the lattice computation of the polyakov loop .",
    "we demonstrate the methodology of extracting the average value of a quantity from mean field approximation .",
    "suppose we have a variable @xmath122 with a probability distribution given by @xmath123 and we have to obtain the average of the function in the exponential @xmath124 ( just like we have to obtain the average of @xmath125 in eqn .",
    "[ eq.prest ] ) .",
    "we define the distribution in the domain @xmath126 .",
    "the distribution is shown in fig.[fg.appn1 ] .",
    "the average is obtained as ,      where @xmath127 is like a partition function . in the given domain",
    "the distribution has no maximum and thus a mean field solution can not be obtained .",
    "let us now make a change of variable from @xmath122 to @xmath1 where @xmath128 .",
    "the distribution becomes @xmath129 as shown in fig.[fg.appn2 ] .",
    "here , @xmath130 is like the jacobian in the main text .",
    "one can now easily check that corresponding to eqn.[eq.appn1 ] , we need to find the expectation value of @xmath131 given by ,      in this case the distribution has a maximum and we can do a saddle point approximation .",
    "we thus minimize @xmath132 $ ] which gives the mean field value @xmath133 . using this value",
    "we find @xmath134 .",
    "so @xmath135 gives a good approximation to @xmath136 . on the other hand if we include the logarithm term we have , @xmath137 = -0.0966 $ ] , which is widely different .",
