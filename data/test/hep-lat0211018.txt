    "the study of quantum chromodynamics at high density is almost as old as the theory itself @xcite . in recent years",
    "the field has attracted wide interest in the wake of a revival of the idea of color superconductivity ( csc ) @xcite . the stimulus for this revival was the observation @xcite that the instanton - induced quark ",
    "quark interaction can be much stronger than that induced by simple one - gluon exchange , and can thus give a transition temperature on the order of 100  mev .",
    "subsequent work @xcite showed that the perturbative color - magnetic interaction also gives rise to a strong pairing interaction .    these and other dynamical considerations @xcite underlie a picture of the ground state of high - density qcd in which the @xmath3 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by a bcs - like condensate .",
    "the details of the breaking , which include both the higgs ( or meissner ) effect and the rearrangement of global symmetries and goldstone bosons , depend on quark masses , chemical potentials , and temperature .",
    "prominent in the list of possibilities are those of color - flavor locking in three - flavor qcd @xcite and crystalline superconductivity  with broken translation invariance  when there are two flavors with different densities @xcite .",
    "for a review see @xcite .    as noted , csc at high density is so far a prediction of weak - coupling analysis .",
    "one expects the coupling to become weak only at high densities , and in fact it turns out that reliable calculations demand extremely high densities @xcite .",
    "the use of weak - coupling methods to make predictions for moderate densities is thus not an application of qcd , but of a model based on it .",
    "it is imperative to confirm these predictions by non - perturbative methods .",
    "standard lattice monte carlo methods , unfortunately , fall afoul of well - known technical problems when the chemical potential is made nonzero , although we do note remarkable progress made recently in the small-@xmath4 regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we initiate a study of high - density quark matter based on lattice qcd in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we work in the hamiltonian formalism , which is more amenable than the euclidean formalism to strong - coupling perturbation theory and to qualitative study of the ensuing effective theory @xcite .",
    "the fermion kinetic hamiltonian is a perturbation that mixes the zero - flux states that are the ground - state sector of the electric term in the gauge hamiltonian . in second order",
    ", it moves color - singlet fermion pairs around the lattice ; the effective hamiltonian for these pairs is a generalized antiferromagnet , with spin operators constructed of fermion bilinears .",
    "we depart from studies of the vacuum by allowing a background baryon density , which is perforce static in second order in perturbation theory .",
    "our aim at this stage is to discover the ground state of the theory with this background . in third order ( when @xmath5 ) the baryons become dynamical ; we display the effective hamiltonian but make no attempt to treat it .",
    "the symmetry group of the effective antiferromagnet is the same as the global symmetry group of the original gauge theory .",
    "this depends on the formulation chosen for the lattice fermions .",
    "following @xcite , we begin with naive , nearest - neighbor fermions , which suffer from species doubling @xcite and possess a global @xmath0 symmetry group that contains the ordinary chiral symmetries [ as well as the axial @xmath6 as subgroups .",
    "we subsequently break the too - large symmetry group with next - nearest - neighbor ( ) couplings along the axes in the fermion hopping hamiltonian .",
    "a glance at the menu of fermion formulations reveals the reasons for our choice .",
    "wilson fermions @xcite have no chiral symmetry and make comparison of results to continuum csc difficult if not impossible . staggered fermions @xcite likewise possess only a reduced axial symmetry while suffering a reduced doubling problem .",
    "the overlap action @xcite is non - local in time and hence possesses no hamiltonian ; attempts @xcite to construct an overlap hamiltonian directly have not borne fruit . finally , domain - wall fermions @xcite have been shown @xcite to lose chiral symmetry and regain doubling when the coupling is strong .",
    "as we discuss below , while the  theory still exhibits doubling in the free fermion spectrum , we are not interested in the perturbative fermion propagator but in the spectrum of the confining theory .",
    "we take it as a positive sign that the unbroken symmetry is now @xmath7 .",
    "this symmetry is what we want for the continuum theory , except for the axial @xmath8 .",
    "the latter can still be broken by hand .",
    "our emphasis on the global symmetries is a consequence of the fact that the gauge field is not present in the ground - state sector and does not reappear in strong - coupling perturbation theory . in other words , confinement is a _",
    "kinematic _ feature of the theory , leaving no possibility of seeing the higgs - meissner effect directly .",
    "this is but an instance of confinement - higgs duality , typical of gauge theories with matter fields in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "our aim is thus to identify the pattern of spontaneous breaking of global symmetries .",
    "for various values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , this can be compared to weak - coupling results @xcite .",
    "this paper is largely an exposition of formalism , along with partial results .",
    "we study the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic hamiltonian , both with and without a uniform baryonic background density .",
    "we transform the quantum hamiltonian into a path integral for a non - linear @xmath11 model , where the manifold of the @xmath11 field depends on the baryon background .",
    "we then investigate the limit of large @xmath9 and show that the global @xmath0 symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken .",
    "adding in the  couplings is a problem of vacuum alignment @xcite .",
    "we do this in the vacuum sector and recover the result @xcite that the @xmath1 chiral symmetry is broken to the vector @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis for the finite - density theory is more involved and we defer it to a future publication .",
    "other groups have recently studied the strong - coupling effective hamiltonian for naive and wilson fermions at non - zero chemical potential @xcite .",
    "we differ from their approaches in eschewing mean field theory in favor of the exact transformation to the @xmath11 model , which is amenable to semiclassical treatment .",
    "as noted above , we base our program on  fermions ; we also work at fixed baryon density .",
    "let us walk through the paper .",
    "we review in sec .",
    "[ sec : heff ] the derivation of the effective hamiltonian of lattice gauge theory in strong - coupling perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the second - order hamiltonian [ @xmath13 is an antiferromagnet with @xmath0 spins ; the global symmetry group is @xmath0 for the nearest - neighbor theory , broken to @xmath1 by  terms .",
    "the baryon number at each site determines the representation of @xmath0 carried by the spin at that site . in second order ,",
    "baryon number is static ; it becomes mobile in the next order , where ( for @xmath5 ) the new term in the effective hamiltonian is a baryon hopping term .",
    "the baryon operators responsible for the hopping are composite operators that do not obey canonical anti - commutation relations .",
    "if this were not the case , then the effective hamiltonian in third order would strongly resemble that of the @xmath14@xmath15 model @xcite , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is an annihilation operator for an electron at site @xmath18 with spin @xmath19 , and the number operators @xmath20 and spin operators @xmath21 are constructed from it .",
    "the added term @xmath22 is a more complicated hopping and interaction term .",
    "the @xmath14@xmath15 model describes a doped antiferromagnet ; it arises as the strong - binding limit of hubbard model , a popular model for itinerant magnetism and possibly for high-@xmath23 superconductivity .",
    "the model is not particularly tractable and , absent new theoretical developments , does not offer much hope for progress in our finite - density problem .",
    "it is nonetheless worth pondering the fact that a model connected , however tentatively , with superconductivity appears in a study of high - density nuclear matter .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we work only to @xmath24 , where the baryons are fixed in position .",
    "motivated by the similarity of our hamiltonian to the heisenberg antiferromagnet , we apply condensed matter methods developed for that problem .",
    "indeed , condensed matter physicists have generalized the @xmath25 , spin-@xmath26 heisenberg model to @xmath27 in many representations @xcite , which corresponds to adding flavor and color degrees of freedom to the electrons . plane . ]",
    "these are exactly the generalizations needed for our effective hamiltonian . with @xmath9 colors and @xmath28 ( single - component ) flavors , a site of the lattice can be constrained to contain a color - singlet combination of @xmath29 particles .",
    "the flavor indices of the spin then make up a representation of @xmath27 whose young diagram has @xmath9 columns and @xmath30 rows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : young1 ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath31 and the correspondence is complete ( until we include  terms in the hamiltonian ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : nls ] we derive a @xmath11 model representation for the partition function of the antiferromagnet . following read and sachdev @xcite ,",
    "we employ spin coherent states @xcite to define the @xmath11 field . @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath30 determine the target space of the @xmath11 model to be the symmetric space @xmath32 $ ] ; the number of colors @xmath9 becomes an overall coefficient of the action . multiplies the quantum hamiltonian , and hence serves only to set the energy scale .",
    "] as for the quantum hamiltonian , the nearest - neighbor theory is symmetric under @xmath33 while the  terms break the symmetry to @xmath1 ( while leaving the manifold unchanged ) .",
    "the @xmath9 multiplying the action invites a large-@xmath9 analysis , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : zerob ] we study the vacuum sector , meaning zero baryon number , thereby .",
    "we return to an exercise proposed and solved by smit @xcite , in generalizing the vacuum sector to allow baryon number @xmath34 on alternating sites ; this means specifying conjugate representations of @xmath33 on alternating sites , with respectively @xmath30 and @xmath35 rows .",
    "as shown by read and sachdev @xcite , in this situation one can carry out an alternating @xmath33 rotation to convert the antiferromagnet into a ferromagnet with _",
    "identical _ spins on alternating sites , and the classical ( @xmath36 ) analysis gives a homogeneous ground state .",
    "the result is , as one might expect , that @xmath33 is broken to @xmath37 in the classical vacuum ; the ground state energy is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath2 corrections to the energy do depend on @xmath30 , however , and they select the self - conjugate @xmath38 configuration ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 everywhere ) as the lowest - energy vacuum .",
    "thus the true ground state breaks @xmath40 .",
    "calculation includes the effect of the time - derivative terms in the action that were dropped in the leading order , and these terms _ do _ remember the difference between the ferromagnet and the antiferromagnet .",
    "] when we add  terms to the action as a perturbation , we find that the ground state breaks @xmath41 to the vector @xmath12 , as expected .",
    "we turn to non - zero baryon density in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonzerob ] .",
    "we study homogeneous states , in which all sites carry the same representation of @xmath33 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the classical vacuum of the @xmath11 model is more elusive than for the vacuum sector , since now there are identical manifolds on adjacent sites but the coupling is antiferromagnetic .",
    "we begin by studying the two - site problem , and we learn that when one of the classical spins is fixed then when the energy is minimized the other spin is still free to wander a submanifold of the original symmetric space . if we replicate this to the infinite lattice then we have a situation where the even spins , say , are fixed in direction while each odd spin wanders the submanifold , independent of the other odd spins .",
    "this means a ground state whose degeneracy is exponential in the volume , similar to some frustrated models or the antiferromagnetic potts model @xcite .",
    "the cure to this disease comes from the @xmath43 fluctuations , which couple the odd spins to each other and make them align . in the end we find that the @xmath33 symmetry is broken by the vacuum to @xmath44 .",
    "perturbing this ground state with the  terms is technically difficult , and we do not attempt it here despite its obvious physical interest .",
    "we close with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "the @xmath43 calculation in the @xmath45 case is relegated to an appendix , as are other ( but not all ) technical details .",
    "for an @xmath46 gauge theory with @xmath10 flavors of fermions , we write the lattice hamiltonian @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the electric term , a sum over links @xmath49 of the @xmath46 casimir operator on each link , @xmath50 next is the magnetic term , a sum over plaquettes , @xmath51 finally we have the fermion hamiltonian , @xmath52 the fermion field @xmath53 carries color @xmath54 and flavor @xmath55 at site @xmath56 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is a kernel that defines the lattice fermion derivative .",
    "it can yield a naive , nearest - neighbor action if @xmath58 ; a long - range slac derivative @xcite if @xmath59 ; or anything in between , such as a  action obtained by truncating the slac kernel to its @xmath60 terms .",
    "for @xmath61 the ground state of @xmath62 is determined by @xmath48 alone to be any state with zero electric field , whatever its fermion content , @xmath63    and are degenerate with respect to all the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider perturbation theory in @xmath64 .",
    "both @xmath65 and @xmath66 are sums of operators that are strictly bounded , independent of @xmath67 except for the explicit coefficient in @xmath65 .",
    "we can dismiss first - order perturbations by noting that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are multilinear in link operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are raising / lowering operators for the electric field ; thus there are no non - zero matrix elements within the zero - field sector .",
    "we proceed to higher orders , and seek an effective hamiltonian that acts in the zero - field sector @xcite . define @xmath70 to be the projector onto the subspace of all the @xmath71 states .",
    "then perturbation theory in @xmath72 gives an effective hamiltonian , @xmath73 here @xmath74 projects onto the subspace orthogonal to the @xmath71 states ; the operator @xmath75 supplies energy denominators , so that @xmath76    the intermediate states @xmath77 contain flux excitations . in second and third order the patterns of flux can only be strings of length @xmath18 in the fundamental representation of the color group . thus the energy denominators are @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the quadratic casimir of the fundamental representation of @xmath46 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath65 and @xmath66 are explicitly of @xmath24 and @xmath80 , respectively ; each energy denominator gives a factor of @xmath81 .",

    "in the zero - field sector in which we work , gauss law constrains the fermion state at each site to be a color singlet .",
    "the drained state @xmath121 , with @xmath122 for all @xmath123 , is the unique state with @xmath124 .",
    "the other color singlet states may be generated by repeated application of the baryon creation operator , @xmath125 with @xmath9 operators @xmath92 .",
    "( here and henceforth , the indices @xmath126 combine the flavor and dirac indices . )",
    "as noted above , at each site @xmath56 the operators @xmath127 generate a @xmath33 algebra , with @xmath128 .",
    "the drained state is obviously a singlet under this algebra .",
    "the creation operator @xmath129 is in the symmetric representation of @xmath33 with one row and @xmath9 columns ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : baryon ] ) .    repeated application of @xmath129 to the drained state gives the state @xmath130 if there are @xmath30 operators @xmath131 , then the state @xmath132 lies in the representation with @xmath9 columns and @xmath30 rows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : young1 ] ) .",
    "its baryon number is @xmath133 .",
    "the second - order effective hamiltonian @xmath102 preserves @xmath134 , the baryon number on each site .",
    "thus any distribution of @xmath134 defines a sector within which @xmath102 is to be diagonalized . in other words , baryons constitute a fixed background in which to study `` mesonic '' dynamics .",
    "the baryon number at each site fixes the representation of @xmath33 at that site , which is the space of states in which the charges @xmath135 act .",
    "the @xmath136 terms in are of the form @xmath137 , and they commute with the generators @xmath138 of a global @xmath33 symmetry group .",
    "this symmetry is in fact familiar from the lattice hamiltonian of naive , nearest - neighbor fermions : spin diagonalization of @xmath10 naive dirac fermions transforms the hamiltonian into that of @xmath139 staggered fermions . in the weak coupling limit , there are in fact @xmath140 fermion flavors  the doubling problem .",
    "this doubling is partially reflected in the accidental @xmath141 symmetry , which is intact in the @xmath142 limit and is respected by the effective hamiltonian . retaining terms in the fermion hamiltonian ( and thus in @xmath143 ) that involve odd separations @xmath18 does not break this symmetry .    the nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite guarantees that any fermion hamiltonian of finite range will possess the full doubling problem .",
    "this is a statement , however , about weak coupling only , since the dispersion relation of free fermions is irrelevant if the coupling is strong and the fermions are confined .",
    "it is interesting that the accidental @xmath0 symmetry nonetheless survives into strong coupling as a vestige of doubling .    the terms in with _ even _ @xmath18 ,",
    "on the other hand , break the @xmath33 symmetry , as do even-@xmath18 terms in the original fermion hamiltonian .",
    "it is easy to see via spin diagonalization , which leaves the even-@xmath18 terms unchanged , that the only generators left unbroken are the @xmath144 corresponding to @xmath145 which form the @xmath146 chiral algebra .",
    "this of course makes no difference to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem , which will enforce 8-fold doubling in the perturbative propagator even without the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "if we are interested in the realization of the global symmetries of the continuum theory , though , we can study this lattice theory which has the same symmetry .",
    "the simplest theory one may study is thus one containing nearest - neighbor and  terms .",
    "we shall proceed to discard terms with longer range ; we shall begin with the nearest - neighbor theory , with its accidental doubling symmetry , and later break this symmetry to @xmath146 with the  terms .",
    "two essential differences will always remain between this lattice theory and the continuum theory .",
    "one is the presence of the axial @xmath8 symmetry on the lattice .",
    "this symmetry is exact , broken by no anomaly , and may make the drawing of conclusions for the continuum theory less than straightforward unless it is broken by hand .",
    "the other difference is the fact that the effective hamiltonian for baryons ( see below ) is also a short - ranged hopping hamiltonian .",
    "if the baryons were almost free , we would say that they are surely doubled like the original quarks .",
    "the fact that the simplicity of the hopping terms is only apparent , and that the baryons are still coupled strongly to mesonic excitations , offers the possibility that doubling may not return .",
