    "since we do not follow @xmath83 and @xmath84 , our treatments of perturbations eventually reduce to those of single field model where only @xmath85 is counted before and after the branes collision .",

    "the consistency of our approximation requires @xmath166 .",

    "this indicates that the contributions of the branes collision to the spectral index is much bigger than the sub - leading @xmath172 contributions to the background @xmath177 .",
    "observationally the result @xmath178 is disfavored @xcite noting that the background spectral index is already nearly scale invariant as seen in eq .",
    "( [ nr0 ] ) . to remedy this problem",
    ", it may be necessary to embed the simple model of ultra relativistic dbi inflation here to a generic setup of brane inflation where a period of slow - roll brane inflation takes place before dbi inflation starts .",
    "this can help to obtain a red spectral index for large scales whereas for smaller scales the spectral index can be blue as we have here .",
    "in this work we have studied the effects of branes annihilation and particles creation in models of dbi inflation where the branes are moving ultra relativistically . in a typical string theory compactification",
    "the process of branes and anti - branes annihilation is a generic phenomenon .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question how these collisions can affect the dynamics of inflation which may also be detectable in the sky .",
    "the process of branes annihilation is determined by the dynamics of open string tachyon condensation . in a complicated background , such as the warped throat with background fluxes ,",
    "this is a non - trivial process .",
    "the time - scale of tachyon condensation and branes annihilation is given by the inverse of the warped string mass scale , @xmath179 . in our effective field theory approach",
    "the hubble expansion rate is considerably smaller than this mass scale so for practical purposes we can take the process of branes annihilation and particles creation to be instantaneous . in our set up",
    "the first inflationary stage is a two - field dbi inflation model .",
    "after the first stack of branes is annihilated with the background anti - branes a burst of closed strings modes are created .",
    "these particles are rapidly diluted by inflation and we eventually end up with a single field dbi inflation system . in order to connect the perturbations in the second inflationary stage to the perturbations generated before the collision we have to use proper matching conditions .",
    "here are the major simplifications imposed in our analysis .",
    "it is assumed that the energy in field @xmath73 , which is annihilated during inflation , is sub - dominant compared to energy stored in field @xmath54 which carries the second stage of inflation .",
    "it is assumed that not only the background energy density in @xmath180 is transferred into radiation @xmath82 but also the perturbations carried by @xmath83 are also transferred into perturbations in radiation , @xmath84 . with these simplifications we can follow the perturbations in @xmath54 before and after the collision using the simple matching conditions ( [ match1 ] ) . although we did not take into account the perturbations @xmath83 and @xmath84 in our analysis but the effects of branes annihilation and particles creation are present at the level of background . in our analysis",
    "this translated into @xmath159 to be non - zero .",
    "interestingly , this is very similar to model studied in @xcite where the feature is due to a sudden change in slow - roll parameters . in @xcite",
    "the sudden change in slow - roll parameters was motivated from a phase transition @xcite during hybrid inflation model @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting that our model , motivated from a completely different setup , shares the same results .",
    "we have calculated the curvature perturbations power spectrum .",
    "the effects of branes annihilation are encoded in the transfer function @xmath138 . for super - horizon scales , modes which are outside the sound horizon at the time of collision",
    ", the transfer function scales monotonically .",
    "consequently , the spectral index is more blue compared to the background spectral index . on the other hand , for small scales , modes which are inside the sound horizon at the time of collision , the transfer function converges to unity with decaying superimposed oscillatory modulations .",
    "the non - trivial transitions in transfer function happen for modes which leave the sound horizon around the time of collision .",
    "the superimposed oscillatory modulations can have interesting observational consequences on cmb analysis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are strong constraints from non - gaussianity bounds on standard dbi inflation @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to calculate the level of non - gaussianities produced in our setup to put further constraints on the model parameters .",
    "our results here should be compared with the results obtained in @xcite where similar problem was studied but in the context of slow - roll brane inflation . in @xcite , like here , it was assumed that the perturbations @xmath83 are transferred into @xmath84 .",
    "however , in @xcite the matching conditions ( [ match0 ] ) have been used instead of the simple matching conditions ( [ match1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the transfer function for large and intermediate scales in @xcite share the same behavior as in our case here .",
    "however , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the transfer function for small scales has a constant oscillatory modulation whereas in our case the amplitude of oscillations decays for these modes . for physical reasons ,",
    "one expects that small scales should be blind to the process of branes annihilation and particles creation so the transfer function is expected to approach unity for these modes . to remedy this problem",
    "several methods were put forward in @xcite .",
    "our approach to use the matching conditions ( [ match1 ] ) may be interpreted as a pragmatic approach towards the methods speculated in @xcite .    to simplify our analysis we considered the model where the branes are moving ultra relativistically . in practice one",
    "expects that a successful brane inflation model consists both stages of slow - roll and fast - roll brane inflation .",
    "it is possible that during early stage of inflation the branes are moving slowly so one may get a few dozens of e - foldings during the slow - roll regime @xcite .",
    "as the branes are moving towards the bottom of the throat they reach the speed limit and one should use the dbi inflation methods as we used in this work .",
    "the process of branes annihilation and particles creation can happen either during slow - roll regime , as in @xcite , during the ultra relativistic fast - roll limit , as in our case here , or in between these two stages . in the third case",
    ", one can not perform analytical studies and a numerical investigation is necessary",

    "<S> the stack closer to the tip of the throat is annihilated with the background anti - branes while inflation proceeds by the second stack . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of branes annihilation and particles creation during dbi inflation on the curvature perturbations power spectrum and the scalar spectral index are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for super - horizon scales , modes which are outside the sound horizon at the time of branes collision , the spectral index has a shift to blue spectrum compared to the standard dbi inflation . for small scales </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum approaches to its background dbi inflation value with the decaying superimposed oscillatory modulations . </S>"
