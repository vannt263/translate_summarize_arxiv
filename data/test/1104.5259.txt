    "in recent years , a considerable amount of research has focused on the study of graph structures arising from technological , biological and sociological systems .",
    "graphs are the tool of choice in modeling such systems since the latter are typically described as a set of pairwise interactions .",
    "important examples of such datasets are the internet graph ( vertices are routers , edges correspond to physical links ) , the web graph ( vertices are web pages , edges correspond to hyperlinks ) , social networks ( vertices are humans , edges correspond to friendships ) , information networks like facebook and linkedin ( vertices are accounts , edges correspond to online friendships ) , biological networks ( vertices are proteins , edges correspond to protein interactions ) , math collaboration network ( vertices are mathematicians , edges correspond to collaborations ) and many more .    towards the end of the 90s , a series of papers observed that the classic models of random graphs introduced by erds and rnyi @xcite and gilbert @xcite did not explain the empirical properties of real - world networks @xcite .",
    "typical properties of such networks include skewed degree distributions @xcite , large clustering coefficients @xcite and small average distances @xcite , a phenomenon typically referred to as `` small worlds '' .",
    "skewed degree distributions have widely been modeled as power laws : the proportion of vertices of a given degree follows an approximate inverse power law , i.e. , the proportion of vertices of degree k is approximately @xmath14 .",
    "understanding the properties of real world networks has attracted considerable research interest in the recent years @xcite .",
    "a large body of work has focused on finding models which generate graphs which mimick real world networks .",
    "most of the existing work on network formation models falls into the stochastic and the strategic categories .",
    "kronecker graphs @xcite , the cooper - frieze model for the web graph @xcite , the aiello - chung - lu model @xcite , protean graphs @xcite and numerous other models belong to the former category .",
    "the strategic approach has its origins in the work of boorman @xcite , aumann @xcite and aumann and myerson @xcite and a variety of models fall into this category , e.g. , the fabrikant - koutsoupias - papadimitriou model @xcite . despite the large amount of work on models which generate power law graphs ,",
    "a considerably smaller amount of work has focused on generative models for planar graphs .",
    "planar graphs have been studied mainly in the context of transportation networks and occur in numerous real - world problems : modelling city streets @xcite , crowd simulations @xcite , river networks , railway and road maps printed circuits , chemical molecules , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this work , we prove fundamental properties of random apollonian networks ( rans ) @xcite , a popular model of planar graphs with power law properties @xcite .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath15 to denote the random graph at time @xmath2 .",
    "the details of the model are exposed in section  [ sec : ran ] .",
    "specifically our main results are the following theorems :    let @xmath16 be the @xmath0 highest degrees of the random apollonian network @xmath15 at time @xmath2 where @xmath0 is a fixed positive integer .",
    "also , let @xmath17 be a function such that @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "then _ whp _",
    "@xmath18    and for @xmath19    @xmath20 [ thrm : thrm1 ]    the growing function @xmath17 can not be removed , see @xcite .",
    "using theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] we relate the highest @xmath0 degrees and eigevalues .",
    "let @xmath21 be the largest @xmath0 eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of @xmath15 . then _ whp _",
    "@xmath22 [ thrm : thrm2 ]    also , we prove the following theorem for the diameter .    the diameter @xmath10 of @xmath15 satisfies in probability @xmath23 where @xmath12 is the unique solution greater than 1 of the equation @xmath13 .",
    "[ thrm : ternary ]    the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : ran ] we describe the model and discuss existing work on rans . in sections",
    "[ sec : degree ] and  [ sec : eigen ] we prove theorems  [ thrm : thrm1 ] and  [ thrm : thrm2 ] respectively . in section  [ sec :",
    "diameter ] we give a simple proof for the asymptotic growth of the diameter and prove theorem  [ thrm : ternary ] . finally in section  [ sec : waiting ] we investigate another property of the model .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we conclude by proposing several problems for future work .",
    "apollonius of perga was a greek geometer and astronomer noted for his writings on conic sections .",
    "apollonius introduced the problem of space filling packing of spheres which in its classical solution , the apollonian packing see @xcite for remarkable properties of apollonian circles- , exhibits a power law behavior .",
    "specifically , the circle size distribution follows a power law with exponent of about 1.3 @xcite .",
    "apollonian networks ( ans ) were introduced in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "zhou et al . @xcite",
    "introduced the random apollonian networks ( rans ) and gave formulae for their order , size , degree distribution ( using heuristic arguments ) , clustering coefficient and diameter .",
    "high dimensional rans were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution of rans was shown to follow a power law in @xcite .",
    "other properties have also been analyzed , e.g. , average distance of two vertices @xcite , properties of the connectivity profile @xcite .",
    "zhou et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple rule that generates a random two - dimensional apollonian networks with very large clustering coefficient .",
    "rans are planar 3-trees , a special case of random @xmath0-trees @xcite .",
    "the general result of the degree distribution of random @xmath0-trees was proved by cooper & uehara and gao @xcite . in rans in",
    "contrast to the general model of random @xmath0 trees the random @xmath0 clique chosen at each step has never previously been selected .",
    "for example in the two dimensional case any chosen triangular face is being subdivided into three new triangular faces by connecting the incoming vertex to the vertices of the boundary .",
    "random @xmath0-trees due to their power law properties have been proposed as a model for complex networks , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , a variant of @xmath0-trees , namely ordered increasing @xmath0-trees has been proposed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "an example of a two dimensional ran is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the ran generator takes as input a parameter @xmath24 equal to the number of iterations the algorithm will perform and runs as follows :    * let @xmath25 be a triangle @xmath26 embedded on the plane , e.g. , as an equilateral triangle . * _ for _ @xmath27 to @xmath24 : * * sample a face @xmath28 of the planar graph @xmath29 uniformly at random . * * insert the vertex @xmath30 inside this face ( e.g. , in the barycenter of the corresponding triangle ) and draw the three edges @xmath31 , @xmath32,@xmath33 , e.g. , as straight lines .",
    "it s worth pointing out why we expect this model to yield a power law degree distribution : consider any vertex @xmath34 at some time @xmath2 .",
    "vertex @xmath34 sees a wheel graph around it ( except for vertices 1,2,3 who see a wheel modulo one edge ) as figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows . since we pick a face uniformly at random the probability that @xmath34 increases its degree by 1 is ( roughly ) proportional to its degree .",
    "therefore , we expect this process to result in a graph , which is obviously planar , and which _ whp",
    "_   occurs with high probability _ whp _  if @xmath35}}=1 $ ] .",
    "] has properties similar to those generated by a preferential attachment process @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should not come as a surprise that existing techniques developed in the context of preferential attachment models can be adapted to solve problems concerning the structure of random apollonian networks .",
    "finally , we shall make use of the following formulae for the number of vertices ( @xmath36 ) , edges ( @xmath37 ) and faces ( @xmath38 ) at time @xmath2 in a ran @xmath15 : @xmath39 note that a ran is a maximal planar graph since for any planar graph @xmath40 .",
    "we decompose the proof of theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] into several lemmas which we prove in the following .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thrm : thrm1 ] follows from lemmas  [ lem : lemma2 ] ,  [ lem : lemma3 ] ,  [ lem : lemma4 ] ,  [ lem : lemma5 ] ,  [ lem : lemma6 ] .",
    "we partition the vertices into three sets : those added before @xmath41 , before @xmath42 and after @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we define a supernode to be a collection of vertices and the degree of the supernode the sum of the degrees of its vertices .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the degree of vertex @xmath46 at time @xmath2 . and let @xmath47denote the rising factorial function .",
