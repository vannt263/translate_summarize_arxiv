    "the quantum annealing algorithm ( qaa ) @xcite has been demonstrated as a promising candidate for a vast number of potential real world problems .",
    "all of the potential applications are too numerous to list here , but include fields as diverse as aerospace @xcite , machine learning @xcite , pure computer science @xcite , and economics @xcite . in this manuscript",
    ", i propose an alternative way of using quantum annealers to solve problems .",
    "the qaa as it is usually structured starts from a superposition state of all possible solutions . the system is then annealed such that quantum fluctuations are introduced through competition between an ising model problem hamiltonian ,    @xmath0    with field variables @xmath1 and coupler variables @xmath2 and a non - commuting driver hamiltonian .",
    "tunneling mediated by these fluctuations is then driven by a low temperature thermal bath .",
    "one example of such a system is the transverse field ising model , which is currently implemented on the annealers produced by d - wave systems inc .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the annealing parameter which controls the annealing schedule , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which are chosen such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and both behave monotonically with @xmath9 .",
    "i also consider more general multi - body driver hamiltonians of the form    @xmath10    where    @xmath11",
    "the reason such drivers are of interest is that they are able to introduce a sign problem in quantum monte carlo simulations if no basis exists for which all off diagonal terms are negative @xcite . no other method is known for large scale low temperature simulations of these so - called non - stoquastic hamiltonians @xcite .    as i previously mentioned , the qaa as it is currently formulated starts from an equal superposition of all classical solutions , meaning that there is no way to incorporate existing knowledge about the solution , either from previous annealing runs or from different algorithms .",
    "one way around this problem is to use algorithms based on local searches around a candidate solution rather than global searches which start from a superposition of all classical solutions @xcite    in this paper i examine ways in which these hybrid algorithms can be extended by annealing the qubits independently .",
    "such additional freedom allows for the annealer to accept individual uncertainty values for each bit , or cluster of bits in the case of multi - body drivers .",
    "i explain how this uncertainty can be understood quantitatively by first drawing a parallel between uncertainty and temperature using the seminal work of nishimori @xcite , and then , as was discussed in @xcite relating this to the strength of driver hamiltonians .",
    "i further explain how these individual certainty values can naturally be used to construct a directed mutation engine for genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "the idea of using an annealer for genetic algorithms is not new , @xcite experimentally demonstrated that a d - wave device can successfully aid these algorithms in finding optimal radar waveforms .",
    "the method i propose however is completely general , and only requires that an annealer be able to realize a problem hamiltonian , rather than a more complex directed mutation hamiltonian .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : inf_prim ] i discuss the abstract idea of an inference primitive , a computational element which takes candidate bit values and associated uncertainties , and returns new candidate solutions and discuss some simple algorithms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_inf ] i discuss how such a computational primitive can be constructed from an annealer , and quantitatively relate the parameters of the annealer to uncertainty values . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_alg ] i discuss in detail how annealer based algorithms can be constructed , followed by a brief discussion in sec .",
    "[ belief_propagation ] about how these methods can be combined with belief propagation methods which allow for problems to be solved which do not fit into the hardware graph .",
    "after that i lay out the details of how protocols can be implemented in hardware to create an inference primitive in sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] , and briefly discuss the feasibility of such constructions in sec . [ feasibility ] . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] i conclude with some overall discussion .",
    "let us now consider a high level description of a subroutine @xmath12 which performs a guided search of an energy landscape based on known information about likely solutions .",
    "i will call such a subroutine an inference primitive , as it will try to infer the correct solution based on input information .",
    "i will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_inf ] in a general sense how an annealer hamiltonian can be thought of as approximating such a computational primitive . later in sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] , i will describe the actual protocol to perform such a task with an annealer .",
    "mathematically we define such an operation as receiving three lists .",
    "firstly , it contains a list @xmath13 such that @xmath14 of length @xmath15 which gives a list of candidate bit values , secondly a list of lists of variables @xmath16 of length @xmath17 where each element @xmath18 contains a non - empty list of bits of length @xmath19 , and finally a list of @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 represents the probability that the actual solution is closer to the @xmath18 than its logical converse @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 indicates that this fact is known with certainty , while @xmath25 indicates no information about which is closer .",
    "the outputs of @xmath12 meanwhile will be a list of @xmath26 solution candidates @xmath27 which may contain the same candidate multiple times . because the optimization problem can be expressed as a hamiltonian , the relative merit of a solution @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of an energy @xmath29 which can be efficiently calculated .    a simple incarnation of such an inference primitive is to set @xmath30 and @xmath31 in this case the list @xmath20 is a list of certainties for the values of each bit .",
    "to build a directed mutation engine from such a primitive given two solution candidates ( for instance the two lowest energy guesses from two previous calls to the primitive ) which we wish to hybridize , we can compare the value of each of the bits .",
    "if the bit values agree then we use the agreeing bit value as a guess and assign a heuristically chosen probability @xmath32 that this guess for the bit value is incorrect . if the two bit values disagree , then we instead assign @xmath33 to indicate that the bit value is unknown .",
    "the effect of this protocol is to produce guesses which are likely to keep the common features of the two initial guesses , but which ignore the bitwise differences .",
    "there are of course many more complicated methods which can be devised , which i will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_alg ] .",
    "this simple method is meant to act as a proof of principle for the idea .",
    "in addition to the simple genetic algorithm application given in the previous paragraph , such an inference primitive can be used to guess a solution based on a list of solution candidates @xmath27 .",
    "this can be achieved by producing new solution candidates based on an average of @xmath27 which is weighted by the energy of each of these candidates , for instance a boltzmann distribution .",
    "such a choice leads to    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a set of unique solution candidates , @xmath38 are the associated energies , and @xmath39 is a heuristically defined temperature .",
    "this method produces new solution candidates based on the information from the high quality solutions of the previous set , with a weighting for quality set by @xmath39 . using this method , a set of solution candidates",
    "can be refined based on the behavior of the highest quality solutions in the set .",
    "many other possibilities for algorithms exist , and i will discuss more of these in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_alg ] , but for now i will lay out the general mathematical framework for computations based on an inference primitive .",
    "such calculations contain two fundamental components , firstly the one already mentioned the the inference primitive @xmath12 , which takes @xmath40 as inputs and outputs @xmath27 the second component are all of the other computations .",
    "i will label each of these @xmath41 , which takes an input @xmath42 containing zero or more sets of @xmath27 and outputs a set of @xmath40 to input into an inference primitive .",
    "these calculations can be represented visually as in fig .",

    ", @xmath43 could set @xmath44 .",
    ", width=151 ]",
    "now that i have laid out the basic principle of what an inference primitive is and how it can be used in computation , i will discuss how this abstract concept relates to physical annealers on a conceptual level , reserving discussion of actual protocols for sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] .",
    "let us first consider the transverse field ising model , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transverseising ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , a stronger transverse field on a qubit implies an increased likelihood that the qubit will be flipped , indicating that this parameter is appropriate to encode the probability that a trial qubit state is correct .",
    "i show that using appropriate mathematical tools , this relationship can be made quantitative , admitting a direct approximate correspondence between transverse field strength and a certainty value defined in the way @xmath22 is defined in the previous section .    to start with , i make use of the fact that it has been numerically demonstrated that quantum fluctuations moderated by a transverse field can be used as a proxy for thermal fluctuations for inference problems @xcite . in this spirit",
    "i define an effective temperature related to a transverse field strength ( set by @xmath45 ) as was done in @xcite by diagonalizing analytically the hamiltonian at the appropriate point in the annealing schedule with a `` problem '' hamiltonian consisting of a single bit hamiltonian with a longitudinal field of unit strength , @xmath46 .",
    "this ratio is than compared to a boltzmann distribution , and the equation inverted to solve for temperature .",
    "this approach yields    @xmath47 @xmath48^{-1}.\\label{eq : teff}\\ ] ]    now i use the seminal result by nishimori @xcite that a temperature can be related to an error probability via the nishimori temperature , @xmath49 .",
    "this relationship is mathematically rigorous and is the underlying principle behind maximum entropy inference , which has many practical applications @xcite .",
    "to leverage this result , i set @xmath50 leading to    @xmath51    by inverting this equation i obtain the approximate certainty value ,    @xmath52^{-1}.\\label{p_sprime}\\ ] ]    this quantitiative relationship allows a direct definition of the certainty values defined in @xmath20 in sec .",
    "[ sec : inf_prim ] in terms of real device parameters . expressed in these term , the algorithms in @xcite assign the same probability of being incorrect to every bit value .",
    "this concept easily generalizes to muti - body terms , the strength of a driver term in the form @xmath53 determines the probability that the overall cluster orientation @xmath18 is closer to the optimal bit configuration than its negation @xmath23 as will be discussed in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_alg ] .",
    "thus far i have assumed that the annealer is exposed to a bath with a temperature which is low compared with the relevant energy scales , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however , this may not be the case in a real annealer .",
    "if we assume the action of thermal and quantum fluctuations are independent , then the effective temperature will be related to the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations added in quadrature ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the physical temperature . carrying this result through ,",
    "we arrive at ,    @xmath58^{-1}. \\label{p_sprimet}\\ ] ]    it is worth discussing briefly a special subclass of problem hamiltonians for which @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isgham ] ) .",
    "for the quantum annealing algorithm the mean orientation of a bit is zero @xmath60 and similarly for any cluster of bits @xmath61 by the fact that these hamiltonians have a @xmath62 symmetry with respect to flipping all of the qubits .",
    "however , the candidate solution breaks this symmetry , meaning that the method of solution refinement described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_inf ] is still valid for this class of problem hamiltonians .",
    "if multiple annealer outputs are being combined for such a problem hamiltonian , then the choice of global gauge for combining these outputs in the function @xmath41 should be chosen as the one which yields the highest correlation between the candidates .",
    "let us now discuss in more detail how to construct algorithms based on inference primitives constructed from annealers .",
    "i will first discuss the possibility of using repeated calls to an annealer based inference primitive to improve a solution , and then i will discuss more general methods of combining multiple outputs . finally , i will briefly mention how these techniques may be combined with those discussed in @xcite .    as i have pointed out already in sec .",
    "[ sec : inf_prim ] , energy weighted statistics from a previous output may be used to refine inference in a later call to an inference primitive .",
    "a simplified version of such protocols which makes use of the quantum annealing algorithm has actually already been experimentally implemented @xcite and shows promise in improving solution quality .",
    "this protocol is based on effectively ` fixing ' the value of individual qubits by removing the qubits which are to be ` fixed ' from the computation and replacing their interactions with other qubits with appropriate fields .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath63 for a subset of the qubits .",
    "the rest of the qubits are annealed normally , corresponding to @xmath64 . in @xcite , the bits are fixed based on whether or not the qubit values are the same within all observed states below an ` elite threshold ' of energy .",
    "a disadvantage of this simplified method is that it requires one to be conservative with which qubits are fixed , if a qubit is fixed in the with the wrong value , than it is not possible to solve the problem .",
    "in contrast , if a bit is assigned @xmath65 , than it is possible that an incorrect assignment can be corrected , therefore allowing the use of evidence which suggests , even weakly , what a qubit value should be .    as for how to decide the values of @xmath66 , there are multiple possibilities .",
    "firstly , as i have already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : inf_prim ] , outputs from a previous call may be reweighted using boltzmann type factors .",
    "this method has the advantage that the temperature parameter in the reweighting can be tuned to determine the relative weight of lower energy candidates .",
    "this parameter itself could be decreased in consecutive runs to construct a sophisticated analogue of a simulated annealing algorithm .",
    "first considering single bit drivers , where all @xmath67 consist of exactly one spin , another option is to simply assign    @xmath68    @xmath69    based on unweighted averages of the ( non - unique ) outputs where @xmath70 is the kronecker delta .",
    "annealer outputs should already generally favour lower energy states , therefore this unweighted average over a qubit or cluster of qubits on these candidates should give reliable information about the certainty of a bit value .",
    "one can also take inspiration from the work of @xcite and generalize the idea of an elite threshold ,    @xmath71    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the heaviside theta defined so that @xmath74 if @xmath75 and @xmath76 otherwise .",
    "all of these methods of determining @xmath16 and @xmath20 based on the candidate solutions found by a single call to the annealer can easily be generalized by defining a new set of candidates as a union of all of candidate sets @xmath77 .",
    "however , other methods for genetic algorithms also exist , which can not be decomposed into taking a union of outputs of other calls to the inference primitive as the input for a later call .",
    "for instance , the simple directed mutation engine idea based on the lowest energy states yielded from two different calls to the inference primitive with different initial suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec : ann_inf ] can not be expressed in such a way .",
    "in fact in general such a call may involve highly non - trivial classical computations , as these methods can be combined arbitrarily with any classical methods which have both input and output states .",
    "let us now consider generalizations of the methods proposed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_therm ] ) , ( [ eq : p_raw ] ) , ( [ eq : p_elite ] ) for multi - body drivers , which for example are necessary to realize non - stoquastic drivers . to do this",
    ", one should consider statistics over the overlap of each of the members of @xmath78 with the solution candidate @xmath79 over the relevant cluster , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of elements in @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath83 , then the cluster agrees exactly for the candidate solution and the @xmath84 .",
    "the value @xmath85 indicates perfect disagreement . as i mentioned",
    "previously the uncertainty value @xmath22 for the cluster @xmath67 corresponds to the probability that @xmath86 is closer to the correct solution than @xmath87 .",
    "positive @xmath88 indicates that @xmath86 is the closer of the two , whereas negative indicates that @xmath89 is closer .    for each cluster",
    ", we can formulate a weighted sum to determine the probability that @xmath86 is closer .",
    "let us employ a weighting factor for each @xmath78 , @xmath90 . based on this weighting factor",
    "i define    @xmath91    we define either @xmath92 to provide a thermal weighting as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_therm ] ) , @xmath93 for unweighted averages as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_raw ] ) , or finally @xmath94 for the elite averages used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_elite ] ) . as for @xmath95",
    ", it should be weighted to favor @xmath96 close to 1 , as these are the values for which cluster flips will make the largest difference .",
    "a logical choice is therefore to choose weights which are inversely proportional to the number of states within the same hamming distance from either @xmath97 or @xmath89 ,    @xmath98    where @xmath81 indicates the number of elements in the set , but @xmath99 indicates the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the two lists of @xmath100 bit orientations .",
    "the techniques proposed here can be combined with the algorithms already proposed in @xcite in multiple ways .",
    "for instance , rather than defining the uncertainty on all of the bits based on the temperature of each annealer call , we can instead control the temperature indirectly using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s_therm ] ) and([eq : p_therm ] ) to calculate individual bit uncertainty based on a thermal reweighting of the previous solutions .",
    "in addition to changing the way in which each of the thermal updates are performed , we can also add offspring at each step in the population annealing @xcite inspired algorithm , using boltzmann weighted probabilities to select which pairs ( or larger groups ) will produce offspring , thereby adding a genetic component to the algorithm .",
    "this can be achieved simply by selecting the first replica to be used based on a standard metropolis rule @xmath101 , removing the one which was chosen from the list , and repeating the process until the desired number of replicas are chosen , where as in @xcite @xmath29 is defined as the lowest energy in @xmath27 .",
    "because of the way that the normalization factor guarantees controls the average population at each step , the mean population will simply be the mean number defined by the population updates plus the number of offspring produced on the previous step as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : popanneal ] .     schematic representation of population annealing inspired algorithm with additional genetic component .",
    "black horizontal lines represent replicas , while green lines represent ways in which the replicas can be carried forward to the next ( lower temperature ) step of the protocol .",
    "they can either be copied directly , or combined with other replicas via an annealer based mutation engine .",
    "replicas with relatively high energy are likely to produce no offspring and not be copied into the next step , as represented by red crosses .",

    "1 ) offspring replicas are made from sets of replicas with the same energy and placed in a temporary pool .",
    "2 ) exchanges are attempted between temporary pool and other replicas using metropolis rules starting from lowest energies and going to highest .",
    "3 ) the temporary replica pool is deleted , and the protocol is carried out on other replicas as suggested in @xcite.,width=188 ]    for the parallel tempering @xcite analogue , it is less clear how to add a genetic component , however this could still be done . to achieve this",
    "we should include multiple replicas at the same temperature , and then combine these to make new replicas as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : partempering ] .",
    "these replicas can be placed in a temporary pool of states .",
    "for the replicas in the temporary pool , exchanges can then be attempted starting from the lowest temperature and going to the highest .",
    "these newly established replicas may have a very different energy from their parents , so exchange rules based on the temperature of the parent replicas are not appropriate .",
    "therefore let us define a simple metropolis like exchange rule based only on the temperature @xmath39 of the replica which the newly created one is attempted to be exchanged with ,    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the energy of the existing replica for which exchange is attempted and @xmath104 is the energy of the replica in the temporary pool .",
    "once all exchanges from the temporary pool have been attempted , this pool can be deleted and replaced with new offspring .",
    "there is a much larger space of potential algorithms which can be constructed using annealers as inference primitives than those mentioned here .",
    "for the current generation of annealers , with hardware graphs which are relatively small compared to the size of many relevant problems , it is important to be able to solve problems which are larger than the available hardware graph . the general method to do",
    "this is to solve problems on modified subgraphs of the hardware graph in an algorithmic way @xcite , eventually converging on a single consistent solution . in this draft",
    "i will focus on one particular method , the generalized belief propagation method proposed in @xcite based on earlier work in @xcite .",
    "although only exact for tree graphs , belief propagation has proven to be an important tool for solving a host of important real world problems , most notably decoding low density parity check codes ( ldpc ) @xcite .",
    "the belief propagation method described in @xcite performs belief propagation between hardware sized subgraphs to obtain an approximate thermal distribution .",
    "because this method obtains a distribution , rather than a single state , it can be used effectively as an inference primitive exactly in the way depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fandphi ] and therefore can be used as a subroutine in all of the previously discussed algorithms .",
    "this could be accomplished by modifying the annealing protocol in the way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] using the same @xmath40 throughout the protocol until either convergence is found or a timeout occurs .",
    "however , the marginals which are calculated throughout the protocol carry beliefs about the likely value a bit and its certainty .",
    "this information can be used to update @xmath66 whenever the beliefs are updated .",
    "these updates will allow for more efficient exploration of the solution space . with fixed @xmath66 new information about bit values",
    "is wasted , if one of the bit values , @xmath18 , with a high value of @xmath22 became inconsistent with the others during the course of this protocol it would likely not be able to correct for this inconsistency and would return a lower quality solution , assuming it converged .    in the algorithm proposed in @xcite , each bit",
    "has an associated marginal , @xmath105 . based on a normalized version of this marginal , we can find an approximate value for @xmath18 and @xmath22 which dynamically updates at each step of the protocol : @xmath106",
    "the protocols which could be used to construct an inference primitive are very similar to those which were discussed in @xcite , but require each of the qubits to be annealed by different amounts .",
    "this however leaves the additional question of the relative timing for annealing each qubit . to accomplish this",
    "let us first anneal each qubit forward to program the state , reprogram the hamiltonian as suggested in @xcite , and anneal each qubit or cluster term to an appropriate point in the annealing schedule @xmath107 which can be determined by inverting eq .",
    "( [ p_sprime ] ) or ( [ p_sprimet ] ) numerically .",
    "then those with the smallest @xmath45 are annealed until they reach the next value , at which point annealing back is started for qubits with that new value of @xmath45 until all qubits are annealed to @xmath108 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schedule ] .     annealing schedule for inference primitive protocol .",
    "this is the same as the one in @xcite except for individual qubits are annealed back to different values of @xmath9 .",

    "the qubits are than annealed back toward @xmath108 , each starting its anneal when the other bits reach the same value of @xmath9 . for @xmath110 ( red ) , setting the initial value is unnecessary , as no information about the qubit value is known .",

    "see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : schedule ] for an illustration of how these methods could be incorporated .",

    "annealing different qubits differently has been used successfully in experiments @xcite .",
    "these protocols also require the ability to reprogram the hamiltonian from a trivial hamiltonian used to program a starting state to a sophisticated problem hamiltonian , however as discussed in @xcite this is likely to be feasible due to the high barriers in the energy landscape late in the anneal .",
    "in this paper i have proposed a new method of using a quantum annealer as an inference primitive which can be combined with other annealer calls and other algorithms in a hybrid fashion rather than being used as a single monolithic problem solving tool as it is in the qaa .",
