    "it is generally agreed that low - frequency ( radio ) emission from relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons . however , it is still debated whether the high - frequency ( x - ray & @xmath0-ray ) emission is due solely to compton scattering by the electrons responsible for the low - frequency synchrotron emission or due to hadronic processes resulting from protons being co - accelerated with the electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if hadronic models are valid , agn would be an expected source of neutrinos , as the proton interactions responsible for the production of neutral pions which result in @xmath0-rays also produce charged pions , which result in secondary electrons , positrons , and neutrinos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "energy losses include ionization , pion production , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission , and the inverse compton effect .",
    "pion production from proton - proton collisions is the dominant energy loss for cosmic ray protons above the 1.3 gev threshold .",

    ", we found that observations of the starburst core in m82 showed a complete turn down of the radio emission at low frequencies .",
    "we attributed this to severe free - free absorption in the core and adopted a model for the starburst core with a cylindrical wall of warm , ionized gas surrounding a lower density hot medium . because some observations at low frequencies did not have enough resolution to distinguish the core from the halo in m82",
    ", we also included a component for radio emission from the halo .",
    "observations for ngc 253 do not show the same severe free - free absorption at low frequencies as in m82 .",
    "however , there is significant free - free emission at high frequencies , as is also the case in m82 .",
    "thus , we expect that at least some fraction of the radio synchrotron emission is still absorbed by ionized gas . to account for this , we keep the thin shell geometry ( with shell width @xmath46 and radius @xmath47 ) for the nucleus , but assume only a small fraction ( @xmath48 ) of the synchrotron emission is absorbed by the ionized gas . then , the radiative intensity of the absorbed synchrotron emission is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius of the hot , diffuse gas ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 is the emission coefficient for the hot gas ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath54 is the absorption coefficient for the warm , ionized gas ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "thus , the total emergent intensity from the starburst region is @xmath60 for an absorption fraction of @xmath61 , this reduces to @xmath62 which is the expression for the radio emission that we used for modeling m82 ( yegz ) .",

    "we vary acceleration efficiency ( @xmath80 ) as it is equivalent to varying the supernova rate and test two spectral indices ( @xmath81 ) . as the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum for ngc 253 is steeper than that of m82 ,",

    ", we also test models at @xmath84 @xmath5 . while we vary the molecular gas mass , we keep the ionized gas mass constant . however , we do vary the ionized gas density ( @xmath85 @xmath7 ) , and thus the filling fraction of ionized gas , as it has a significant impact on free - free absorption and emission in the radio spectrum .    to distinguish between models , we use @xmath86 tests to compare to the observed data .",
    "we can see from the contour plots of the @xmath86 values that the @xmath0-ray and radio data constrain the value for the magnetic field strength and wind speed in different ways ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "there is a degeneracy for the magnetic field strength and wind speed for the radio data such that as the magnetic field strength increases , an increase in wind speed allows for a similarly good fit .",
    "the reverse is true for the @xmath0-rays . in the radio spectrum ,",
    "an increase in magnetic field strength results in an increase in synchrotron emission such that the number of electrons must be reduced ( see yegz for further explanation ) .",
    "however , in the @xmath0-ray spectrum , an increase in the magnetic field strength leads to a reduction of the inverse compton flux as fewer electrons are available as a result of the shorter energy loss lifetimes .",
    "thus , the wind speed must be reduced to allow for more electrons to be available to produce inverse compton emission .    because the results are essentially non - complementary , we were not able to find a joint solution ( a best - fit model for both the @xmath0-ray and radio spectra based on a common set of parameters ) for the radio and @xmath0-ray data assuming @xmath18 @xmath5 for the molecular mass .",
    "this is highlighted in figure 2 , where the combined reduced @xmath86 result is dominated by the radio data . for the radio spectrum ,",
    "optimal wind speeds are essentially the no wind case ( @xmath40 ) which is not supported by observations of ngc 253 . for the @xmath0-ray spectrum , optimal wind speeds range from @xmath87 km  s@xmath12 , which is slightly higher than optical determinations of the wind speeds .",
    "additionally , while @xmath0-ray models allow for a wide range of magnetic field strengths , radio models constrain the magnetic field strength to @xmath88 @xmath78 g .",
    "these field strengths correspond to @xmath222000 to @xmath223000 ev  @xmath7 .",
    "cosmic ray energy densities are nearly an order of magnitude below this , @xmath22200 to @xmath22300 ev  @xmath7 for @xmath89 . while the magnetic field energy density lies at the high end of the range of the assumed radiation field energy densities , the cosmic ray energy densities are within a factor of two of the lower end of the range .",
    "taken at face value , these model results suggest that for the system the magnetic field and radiation field are in approximate equipartition while the cosmic rays are sub - equipartition .",
    "in addition to limiting the possible magnetic field strength and wind speed values , the @xmath0-ray data severely constrain the possible combinations of spectral index and acceleration efficiency . while the radio data is fit equally well by all combinations of acceleration efficiency and spectral index , the @xmath0-ray spectrum is easily overestimated because of the large radiation fields and high densities in starburst regions . as such",
    ", the majority of the combinations of acceleration efficiency and spectral index do not result in a minimized ( best - fit ) @xmath86 value for the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "so , to keep the combination of pion decay and inverse compton emission in check , our model rules out acceleration efficiencies of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for both spectral indices .",
    "we also rule out the spectral index of @xmath92 for all acceleration efficiencies , as the best - fit models underestimate the @xmath0-ray spectrum at tev energies ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , the only combination of acceleration efficiency and spectral index which both minimizes and fits the tev energy data is @xmath89 , @xmath93 .",
    "equivalently , a larger acceleration efficiency pared with a lower supernova rate would have the same result , as we constrain their product .",
    "the goodness of our @xmath86 fits also change slightly depending on the radiation field energy density .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0-ray spectrum occurs for an energy density of 2000 ev  @xmath7 for a spectral index of @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-ray spectrum is dominated by pion decay emission but still has a significant contribution from inverse compton emission at tev energies ( see figure 3 ) .    aside from the parameters",
    "discussed thus far , we also vary the fraction of synchrotron emission absorbed in ionized gas clouds ( see table 2 ) .",
    "observations show that at low frequencies , the radio spectrum for ngc 253 levels off , unlike the radio spectrum for m82 which turns over at low frequencies . in the case of m82 , to fit the radio spectrum properly , we required that all of the synchrotron emission from the hot , diffuse medium was absorbed in ionized gas clouds such that @xmath94 ( yegz ) .",
    "however , as the radio spectrum for ngc 253 only flattens , we varied the absorption fraction to find what absorption fraction was required to accurately fit the spectrum .",
    "we found that models with an absorption fraction of up to @xmath95 agreed with all compared radio data points ( see figure 4 ) , including models with no absorption fraction ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the best - fit models were for an absorption fraction of @xmath97 , which was selected for use for the remainder of our models .",
    "in yegz , we found that while m82 was an electron calorimeter , it was , at best , only a partial ( @xmath2250% ) proton calorimeter .",
    "for ngc 253 , we find that it is an electron calorimeter and that it can be a proton calorimeter , depending upon the selected parameters .",
    "we based our conclusions on a comparison between energy - loss and advection timescales . in ngc 253 , we find that the average wind speeds for the best - fit @xmath0-ray models are on the order of @xmath87 km  s@xmath12 . the best - fit wind speed decreases depending on the assumed magnetic field strength . comparing timescales , we find that ngc 253 is a @xmath2250% proton calorimeter .",
    "however , the best - fits for the radio spectrum were for the no wind case . in this case , ngc 253 would be a complete proton calorimeter ( cf .",
    "while the @xmath0-ray data were readily fit with our model , the radio spectrum presented much more of a challenge .",
    "as previously stated , we were not able to find a joint solution for the @xmath0-ray and radio models .",
    "while our best - fit for the @xmath0-ray spectrum had a reduced @xmath86 value of 2.0 , the best - fit for the radio spectrum had a reduced @xmath86 value of 50 .",
    "in addition to the preferred wind speed being unphysical , the best - fit model does not match up well with the @xcite data .",
    "although we did not explicitly vary molecular gas mass in our models , we did originally test a lower gas mass .",
    "models tested with a lower gas mass of @xmath98 @xmath5 resulted in significantly better radio fits ( see figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "our best - fit model with the lower mass has a reduced @xmath86 value of 12 .",
    "this reduction in @xmath86 with the lower mass is due to higher bremsstrahlung losses for higher masses .",
    "thus , for the lower mass , more electrons are available to produce synchrotron emission at the low frequencies instead of bremsstrahlung .",
    "the discrepancy between fits for the different gas masses is , in large part , due to the limitations of the one - zone model .",
    "while there are many computational advantages to assuming a simple single zone , there are also disadvantages . in yegz",
    ", we noted that by assuming a single ionized gas density in our model , we were unable to fit both the high - frequency radio data and the low - frequency turn down . in ngc 253",
    ", our one zone model has reached the calorimeter limit for the higher gas mass . as such , while we are producing the same amount of secondary electrons and positrons at both masses , there are fewer electrons / positrons available to produce inverse compton and synchrotron emission due to an increase in bremsstrahlung .",
    "the cmz dust temperature is the key to modeling the @xmath0-ray observations for ngc 1068 as it determines the radiation field that inverse compton emission depends on .",
    "observations by @xcite show a blackbody spectrum with temperatures in the range of @xmath99 for the inner cnd .",
    "when assuming a radiation field from dust with @xmath100 k , the photon number is significantly decreased such that our models produce negligible inverse compton @xmath0-ray emission . however , this dust temperature is attributed to the dusty torus of the agn nucleus and likely does not dominate the larger , surrounding cmz . as such , we assume that the dust temperature in the cmz is on par with the temperatures of molecular gas in the region , @xmath22100 k , and we use this to determine the radiation field spectrum .    as with ngc 253",
    ", we intended to test a variety of different sets of parameters with which to model ngc 1068 .",
    "however , we found ngc 1068 significantly harder to model than ngc 253 .",
    "the upper bound on the supernova rate produces a @xmath0-ray spectrum that is lower by a factor of only a few ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "however , a lower bound on the supernova rate results in a @xmath0-ray spectrum that is nearly two order of magnitudes lower than the observed data .",
    "because we were underestimating the @xmath0-ray emission , we selected parameters to maximize the inverse compton emission ( a magnetic field strength of @xmath101 @xmath78 g and a radiation field energy density of @xmath102 ev  @xmath7 ) and the pion decay emission and bremsstrahlung ( a wind speed of @xmath103 km  s@xmath12 ) . even selecting parameters to augment the @xmath0-ray emission , without invoking an extra source of cosmic rays , we were not able to produce a model which agrees with the _ fermi _ observations to better than a factor of a few .    further complicating matters is the radio spectrum for ngc 1068 .",
    "while the galaxy has been extensively observed in the radio spectrum , the presence of a radio jet greatly overshadows any emission not originating from the agn or its jets .",
    "ultimately , we chose to compare our radio models against a few different radio observations .",
    "first , we plot our radio models against radio observations of the agn core ( s1 ) found in @xcite . though the observations of the agn are on the parsec - scale , they do highlight the fact that they are of a fundamentally different nature than the emission from star - forming regions .",
    "we also plot radio observations of the region labeled s2 @xcite , which could be the counter - jet as seen through the star - forming disk .",
    "additionally , we use the 18  cm radio map in @xcite to compare with our models .",
    "while the outermost contour includes the spiral arms , the second contour should give us an upper limit on the radio continuum in the cmz excluding the component from the agn and the jets .",
    "taking the brightness level ( of 74 mjy / beam ) and multiplying by the area of the cmz , we obtain an upper limit of @xmath22 13 mjy ( see red squared in figure 5 ) .",
    "while nearly all of the energy of the cosmic ray electrons goes into inverse compton emission , some small fraction of the energy is lost due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission . assuming a moderate starburst magnetic field strength of 200  @xmath78 g results in a significant amount of synchrotron emission .",
    "as the upper limit ( red square ) that we plot is nearly an order of magnitude below the model , we must be significantly overestimating the synchrotron emission in the cmz .",
    "thus , while assuming the upper limit on the supernova rate results in a @xmath0-ray spectrum which comes within a factor of a few of the observed data , the radio spectrum disagrees significantly with observations ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "previously , we developed and tested a model for cosmic ray interactions in starburst nuclei ( yegz ) . in testing our model against other nuclei and combined starburst / agn environments ,",
    "we have applied our updated model to two giant , barred spiral galaxies ; specifically , we have modeled both ngc 253 , with an unambiguous starburst nucleus , and ngc 1068 , the archetypal seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum for ngc 253 is well fit with a combination of emission from neutral pion decay , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton , requiring both hadronic and leptonic emission mechanisms .    while we find a joint solution for the @xmath0-ray and radio spectra for the lower molecular gas mass for the ngc 253 cmz , we were unable to do the same at a higher gas mass ( @xmath18 @xmath5 )",
    ". @xcite find best - fit models for both the @xmath0-ray and radio spectra for similarly large densities ( @xmath104 @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , they do not include wind speed as a free parameter and fix their advection / diffusion timescale at 10 myr ( which is equivalent to a wind speed of @xmath22 5 km  s@xmath12 for a half - thickness of 50 pc ) .",
    "this would allow for a good fit to the radio spectrum at higher masses and their lower radiation field would also allow for a similarly good fit for the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "other models include those of @xcite who find joint solutions when assuming parameters closer to our lower gas mass and wind speeds between 300 and 600 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "we believe that the data support our choice of gas masses in the @xmath4 @xmath5 range as well as wind speeds of @xmath105 km  s@xmath12 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that our models therefore contain astrophysically reasonable parameters .    though located nearly four times further away , ngc 1068 has a @xmath0-ray flux comparable to that of ngc 253 . in comparing our model with observations , we find that the inner starburst region in ngc 1068 does not supply a sufficient cosmic ray population to produce the observed @xmath0-ray emission by itself .",
    "this agrees with analysis of the supernova rate , total gas mass , and @xmath0-ray luminosity by @xcite for ngc 1068 in comparison to other starburst galaxies . while a scenario which boosts the cosmic ray population in the cmz , such as a diffusion of cosmic rays from the circumnuclear ring into the cmz , is possible , it is most likely that the high - energy emission results from interactions in the jet .",
    "an agn jet origin of the @xmath0-ray emission in ngc 1068 agrees with calculations of @xcite who propose a leptonic external inverse compton ( eic ) model for the high - energy emission .",
    "while proton - proton interactions dominate as a cosmic ray energy loss mechanism in the ism , proton-@xmath0 interactions will be dominant in the jet due to the lack of molecular gas necessary for proton - proton interactions .",
    "proton - proton interactions result in both charged and neutral pions . while neutral pions decay quickly into @xmath0-rays , charged pions decay into muons and neutrinos followed by electrons and positrons and more neutrinos",
    ". thus , galaxies whose @xmath0-ray spectra are dominated by or are significantly contributed to by pion decay will also be sources of neutrinos .",
    "as proton-@xmath0 interactions still result in pion production , agn could also be a source for neutrinos as starbursts are , if @xmath0-ray emission in the jet is hadronic .    while a detection of neutrinos from agn would help to determine the origin of @xmath0-ray emission",
    ", such a detection will also provide vital clues for starburst galaxies .",
    "observations of neutrinos provide direct information about the nature of the @xmath0-ray spectrum and the cosmic ray proton population .",
    "better constraining the contribution of neutral pion decay to the @xmath0-ray spectrum , also better constrains the contribution of bremsstrahlung and inverse compton emission . in the case of inverse compton , this would be another diagnostic for determining the radiation field , which can be uncertain in such environments .    to make a neutrino flux prediction , we start with the source function for muon neutrinos which results from charged pion decay ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) depends on the source function for pions : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the source functions for pions ( see yegz for details ) and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we found that the @xmath0-ray spectra for ngc 253 had a significant contribution from pion decay .",
    "while this results in a significant neutrino flux ( see figure 6 ) , the steep spectrum of ngc 253 means that m82 is a more likely candidate for eventual detection of the energetic neutrinos for which icecube has good sensitivity @xcite .",
    "though all of our models for ngc 1068 underestimated the @xmath0-ray emission , we find that the corresponding neutrino flux from the starburst region is comparable to that of ngc 253 at tev energies ( see figure 6 ) . however , if the high - energy emission in the jet is hadronic , ngc 1068 may still be a detectable source of neutrinos , particularly if the flat @xmath0-ray spectrum seen in figure 5 continues to higher energies . at energies below 1 gev , models predict a significant difference in the spectra for inverse compton and pion decay @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "thus , in the future , hard x - ray observations , such as those by nustar , should be able to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic emission mechanisms for @xmath0-ray production in such galaxies and determine whether these galaxies are likely to be detectable in neutrinos .",
    "in this paper , we explore the differences between starburst galactic nuclei and agn and their impact on cosmic ray interactions . as a typical nuclear starburst environment , ngc 253",
    "can be fit with our model that includes inverse compton emission .",
    "we find that for an assumed gas mass of @xmath111 @xmath5 , the @xmath0-ray and radio spectra can not uniquely determine the magnetic field strength or wind speed .",
    "additionally , the @xmath0-ray spectrum also severely limits the possible combinations of spectral index ( to @xmath89 ) and acceleration efficiency ( to @xmath93 ) due to the powerful combination of effects due to inverse compton and pion decay emission .",
    "past models for ngc 253 have assumed a fixed wind ( advection ) speed which presupposes calorimetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "based on our results , a wind is a critical component for determining the degree to which a starburst system is a calorimeter . while the best - fits to the @xmath0-ray spectrum result in a @xmath2250% proton calorimeter , fits to the radio spectrum result in a complete proton calorimeter",
    ". additionally , our fits result in systems below equipartition ( in regards to the cosmic ray energy densities ) with strong magnetic fields ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of a solution which fits the @xmath0-ray and radio spectra together with a single set of parameters and the problems in fitting the radio spectrum highlight the limitations of this one - zone model .",
    "we , however , can obtain a good fit to @xmath0-rays and the radio by assuming a lower gas mass .",
    "understanding of the ism conditions is vital to applying these models to starbursts . as such , while the model works well for a late phase starburst such as m82 , it does not as easily fit an early phase starburst such as ngc 253 .    as an agn environment containing a possible starburst region , ngc 1068",
    "is not fit with our self - consistent starburst model .",
    "while we find a few models that come close to predicting the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum for ngc 1068 , all of our models underestimate the high - energy emission and we are unable to find any models of the inner starburst region that agree with the observed data .",
    "thus , we find that the cosmic ray population from the starburst region alone is not enough to accurately fit the observed @xmath0-ray emission and even those models in rough agreement with high - energy observations result in an overestimation of the radio spectrum .",
    "we conclude that the observed @xmath0-ray emission likely occurs in the agn or its jets .    additionally , we find that starburst galaxies such as ngc 253 are potential sources for high energy neutrino detection",
    ". however , agn with high @xmath112 such as ngc 1068 will not be luminous neutrino sources unless their high - energy emission is of hadronic origin .",
