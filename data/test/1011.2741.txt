    "the best way to detect very high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays ( 100 gev @xmath1 e @xmath1 100 tev ) , of cosmic origin , from the ground is by imaging the cherenkov light produced by the secondary particles once the @xmath0-rays interact within the atmosphere .",
    "this method employs elaborate instruments , as the ground based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) @xcite .",
    "the major iact experiments currently in operation , magic @xcite , veritas @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , and cangaroo - iii @xcite have shown us an immense potential for scientific discoveries with significant consequences for astrophysics , cosmology and particle physics .",
    "a new era of outstanding precision will begin with the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) - the next generation of highly automated telescopes for gamma - ray astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the number of known vhe @xmath0-ray sources has exponentially grown and is presently more than 100 @xcite .",
    "some of them belong to the category of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it is inferred that agns have large luminosities , beamed emission and their energy source is the release of gravitational energy from an accretion disk surrounding a super - massive black hole @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting for the vhe @xmath0-ray community are the blazars , a sub - class of agns whose relativistic plasma outflows ( jets ) point towards the observer . so far , more than 10 agns have been detected in the vhe @xmath0-ray window and most of them are blazars .",
    "one distinctive feature of blazars is the strong variability of their vhe emission .",
    "it ranges from years down to minutes scales @xcite .",
    "the study of this variability may help us better understand the central engine of agns , the particle acceleration within their plasma jets , and the propagation of these jets .",
    "long - term monitoring observations of the blazars and maybe some other sources will provide the vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy of the future years with data of paramount importance for solving these problems .",
    "the major iact experiments are presently performing observations at their sensitivity limit or in multi - wavelength campaigns for most of their operation time .",
    "if monitoring observations take place ( see magic @xcite ) , the amount of time assigned is , by far , not sufficient .    under these circumstances and due to the importance of the observational data , a global network of several small cherenkov telescopes",
    "was proposed to be operated in a coordinated way for long - term monitoring observations of the brightest blazars - the dwarf ( dedicated worldwide agn research facility ) network @xcite .",
    "this network will have to be distributed around the globe for 24/7 monitoring , preferably with temporal overlap and redundancy to account for weather and duty cycle constraints , as well as for muon background reduction .",
    "the prototype telescope of this network is the former hegra ct3 telescope , located at the roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma , completely refurbished with an enlarged mirror area and a robotic design @xcite .",
    "the dwarf type telescopes have smaller reflectors ( total surface @xmath2 10 @xmath3 ) than the largest ones ( magic , hess @xmath4 100 @xmath3 ) and this limits the observations to the brightest vhe gamma - ray sources at a few hundred gev energy threshold , still acceptable for monitoring purposes .",
    "so far , around the world , several scientific projects share the interest of the dwarf network in monitoring observations of the brightest blazars .",
    "since 2005 , the whipple telescope located on mt .",
    "hopkins in arizona , usa has been used for nightly monitoring observations and since 2007 it was decided that whipple observations will dovetail with those of the dwarf telescope @xcite . the tactic telescope situated on mt .",
    "abu , india is also dedicated to long - term monitoring observations and it can be operated within the dwarf network @xcite .",
    "two of the former hegra air cherenkov telescopes will be refurbished , installed and operated as the omega project on the volcano sierra negra in the state of puebla , mexico @xcite .",
    "the main scientific goal of omega is testing at very high altitude ( @xmath2 4100 m a.s.l . )",
    "its ability to detect the cherenkov light from the air showers generated by vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "however , omega will be also used for monitoring observations of the brightest blazars and to follow up candidate hawc @xcite sources .",
    "the star base utah will be a stereoscopic system of two telescopes located close to salt lake city , usa @xcite .",
    "after the cherenkov cameras will be completed , the system will be used for monitoring observations , as well .",
    "croatea is proposed to be a small iact system based on two ex - hegra telescopes , located near the adriatic coast in croatia @xcite .",
    "croatea will serve as a test telescope for new photodetectors and as an observatory devoted to known agns .    to join the international efforts on understanding the physics of vhe @xmath0-rays , a small",
    ", ground based , imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope of last generation is intended to be installed and operated in romania as a component of the dwarf network .",
    "on the initiative of the institute of space sciences at bucharest - magurele , a consortium has been established in order to prepare the construction , in romania , of an observatory for vhe @xmath0-ray studies .",
    "the observatory will employ , at the beginning , a small , ground - based , last generation , cherenkov telescope .",
    "upgrades and developments are possible in the future .",
    "the major scientific goals to be accomplished are : to work in synergy with gamma - ray telescopes around the world for long term monitoring observations of the brightest blazars and eventually other vhe @xmath0-ray sources , to perform broadband multi - wavelength observations in collaboration with other observatories , to participate in multi - messenger observations of @xmath0-rays and neutrinos with neutrino observatories and last but not the least , to exploit its great educational potential for the students interested in the field .    to prepare the construction of the observatory ,",
    "two support projects have been initiated .",
    "the first one is focused on building a dedicated instrument to measure the level of the background light of night sky ( lons ) @xcite . within the framework of the second project ,",
    "a site testing campaign has started at the end of 2007 .    during this campaign ,",
    "we have assessed all the places where middle altitude meteorological stations from the romanian national network have been in operation over the last ten years .",
    "a time range of ten years is usually considered appropriate when general , long - term tendencies are looked for in meteorological data sets .",
    "subsequently , taking into consideration technical , economical and social selection criteria ( section iii.b and iii.c ) , we generated a short list of four locations ( table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "however , this is not the list of final choice .",
    "an upgraded version will be produced when the future in - situ light pollution measurements will be completed .",
    "a statistical data analysis of the standard meteorological parameters ( air temperature , humidity , air pressure , wind speed ) was performed on the ten years data from the national meteorological database for the sites on the short list .",
    "the results will be published in a future paper .    in this paper",
    ", we submit a brief report on the general characteristics of the sites included on the present short list , from the point of view of the local infrastructure , the nearby facilities and the social impact .    cccc site & latitude & longitude & altitude [ m ] + baisoara & @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 n & @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 e & @xmath11 + rosia montana & @xmath5 @xmath12 @xmath13 n & @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 e & @xmath16 + semenic & @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 n & @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath15 e & @xmath22 + ceahlau & @xmath5 @xmath23 @xmath24 n & @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 e & @xmath28 +",
    "systematic site testing is generally justified by the need to find the best new sites for the settlement of an astronomical observatory and sometimes by the need to make a proper selection among sites already in use and considered as good ones .",
    "all the astronomical telescopes are designed and operated in close relation with the local conditions .",
    "the site has a significant influence on the good quality of the future astronomical data as well as on the scientific productivity of the observatory , over its lifetime .",
    "the characteristics of the site affect the cost and ease of construction and operation .",
    "there is also an impact on the activities of management , technical support , and personnel recruiting .",
    "therefore , the selection of a site is always a critical issue .",
    "no requirements are created for a site in the form of limits for certain parameters , as there are generally no hard cut - offs beyond which a site becomes unsuitable .",
    "instead , the scientific teams measure the technical properties of the sites with the highest accuracy and longest temporal baseline possible .",
    "these parameters are subsequently balanced against each other using a methodology developed during the course of the site testing process @xcite .",
    "iacts are mainly used as astronomical instruments , observing in the near uv bands ( uvb and uva ) and the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( the wavelength range of cherenkov light photons goes roughly from 300 to 600 nm @xcite ) .",
    "most of the criteria that apply to the selection of the sites hosting astronomical telescopes operating in this wavelength range , also apply to the sites hosting iacts .",
    "a review of these criteria follows below .",
    "a.   the site should be located at moderate to high altitudes ( 1000 - 2500 m ) , if possible , above the inversion layer @xcite ; it is under consideration if exceeding the altitudes of @xmath2 3000 m can be beneficial or not to an iact @xcite , b.   the site with the lowest possible value of geomagnetic field ( gf ) should be selected in order to minimize the influence of this parameter on the observatory performance @xcite , c.   the site should be characterized by good atmospheric transparency ( minimization of rayleigh and mie scattering ) .",
    "this happens when there is a low cloud coverage , a low amount of dust in the air and a low level of chemical pollution , d.   the site should be characterized by a low level of humidity .",
    "high humidity can produce severe damages to electronics and it can increase the absorption of the cherenkov light in the blue , e.   low speed winds are required for the site as moderate speed winds can put the electronic camera in oscillation and high speed winds can damage the large mirror of the telescope , f.   the temperatures at the site should be moderate and preferably free from ice ( protection of mirrors ) and snow ( reduced level of albedo radiation ) , g.   the site should be characterized by a low level of natural ( e.g. aurora borealis ) or man - made light pollution , h.   the atmospheric turbulence above the site should be low ( stable atmosphere ) in order to enable a maximum response for highly inclined showers @xcite .",
    "however , iacts are less influenced than the optical ground based telescopes by the turbulences in the earth s atmosphere , because the objects under study are vhe @xmath0-ray induced air showers and the fluctuations in the shower development are considerably higher than the effects of wavefront distortions @xcite .",
    "a.   the site should be one of good geological and geotechnical conditions ( seismic activity , mechanical properties of the soil , vibration transmission properties ) , b.   the site should have good access roads for transportation purposes , c.   the site should offer a large enough area for the installation and the safe operation of the telescope and the associated equipment and buildings , d.   electricity and water supplies should be available on site .",
    "a.   the construction and operation costs associated to the site should be under the available budget , b.   the site should allow for land ownership or eventually the rent paid should be as low as possible , c.   the travel costs to the site should be low , d.   the labor force availability and the economic impact of building the telescope ( new jobs on the market ) should be considered , e.   the cultural , the archeological , the environmental and the land use potential restrictions have to be considered , f.   the reasonable proximity of the site to academic centers is desirable .",
    "based on the above considerations , when site selection programs are underway , systematic site - to - site comparisons are carried out and the site that best fits the above criteria is selected .",
    "the site is located in the region of transilvania , the cluj county .",
    "there is a modernized , paved road , 18 km long , connecting the site to the local county road .",
    "the closest major cities are cluj - napoca ( @xmath2 60 km , @xmath2 318,000 inhabitants ) and turda ( @xmath2 55 km , @xmath2 60,000 inhabitants ) . the closest bus station is 18 km away , in the village of baisoara and this is also the place where basic supplies can be purchased . the closest hospital is located in turda .",

    "no chemical hazards can be identified in the area .",
    "the meteorological station whose database was used for analysis is located next to a skiing resort , this contributing some light pollution . however",
    ", the telescope is going to be built outside the location of the meteorological station in a more suitable , darker place in the region of baisoara .",
