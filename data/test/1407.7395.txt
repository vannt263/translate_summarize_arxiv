    "positron emission tomography is currently one of the best suited medical examination methods for tumor detection .",
    "nowadays commercial pet scanners are made of crystal scintillators arranged in a ring surrounding the patient  @xcite .",
    "new generation of pet scanners for the image reconstruction not only utilizes information about the hit position of gamma quanta in the detectors but also takes advantage of the measurement of the time differences ( tof ) between the interactions of annihilation quanta in the detectors  @xcite .",
    "this improves image reconstruction by increasing the signal to background ratio  @xcite .",
    "a typical tof resolution of presently used tof - pet detectors amounts to about 500  ps  ( fhwm )  @xcite , and there is a continuous endeavor to improve it ( see e.g. results for small size crystals  @xcite ) .",
    "the jagiellonian - pet ( j - pet ) collaboration aims at the construction of the tof - pet scanner with a large field of view ( up to about 1 m ) and a superior tof resolution by application of fast plastic scintillators instead of organic crystals .",
    "the detector will be built out from strips of plastic scintillators forming a diagnostic chamber  @xcite as shown schematically in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ uklad ] .",
    "+    a single detector module of the j - pet detector consists of a plastic scintillator strip read out by photomultipliers at both ends .",
    "plastic scintillators are less efficient for the detection of gamma quanta than crystals but they posses better timing properties and allow to build large acceptance detectors in a cost efficient way .",
    "therefore , a pet scanner based on plastic scintillators constitutes a promising solution in view of the tof resolution and construction of the scanner allowing for simultaneous imaging of the whole human body .",
    "development of a cost - effective whole body pet scanner is a technological challenge and there are various non - standard techniques being tested such as detectors based on straw tubes drift chambers  @xcite or large area resistive plate chambers  @xcite .",
    "the j - pet detector with plastic scintillators arranged axially as shown in fig .",
    "[ uklad ] possesses also another advantage .",
    "its diagnostic chamber is free of any electronic devices and magnetic materials , thus giving unique possibility for simultaneous imaging of pet and mri as well as pet and ct in a way different from so far developed configurations  @xcite .",
    "a similar axial arrangement with crystal scintillators of the length of 10  cm is being developed by the ax - pet collaboration aiming at improvement of resolution and sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "detectors based on plastic scintillators are commonly used in nuclear and particle physics experiments , however , due to negligible probability of photo - electric effect , their potential for registration of low energy gamma quanta ( in the range of fraction of mev ) was so far not explored except for few publications concentrated on the light propagation studies  e.g.  @xcite , or callibration methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that plastic scintillators can be used for building large area detection systems with very good time , position and energy resolution for the registration of low energy gamma quanta .    in section 2 a comprehensive description of experimental setup used for investigations",
    "is presented .",
    "next , sections 3 , 4 and 5 include description of methods and results for the determination of the energy , time and position resolution , respectively .",

    "[ uklad ] .",
    "a prototype module consists of a bc-420  @xcite scintillator strip with dimensions of 5  mm  x  19  mm  x  300  mm and of two hamamatsu photomultipliers r5320  @xcite connected optically to the most distant ends of the scintillator strip via optical gel ej-550 .",
    "the module is tested with annihilation quanta from the @xmath1ge source placed inside a lead collimator which can be moved along the scintillator by means of a dedicated mechanical construction . a collimated beam emerging through 1.5  mm wide and 20",
    "cm long slit is used for irradiating desired points across the strip .",
    "a coincident registration of signals from the tested module and a reference detector allows for a suppression of signals from other than annihilation quanta to the negligible level .",
    "the reference detector consists of a scintillator strip with thickness of 4  mm connected via light guide to the photomultiplier .",
    "the reference detector is fixed to the collimator by means of an aluminum arm allowing to keep the relative setting between the collimator and the reference detector unchanged while moving the collimator along the tested scintillator strip . in this way the same collimating properties",
    "are ensured at every position of irradiation .",
    "signals from photomultipliers are probed with 50  ps intervals by means of serial data analyzer ( lecroy sda6000a ) .",

    "these requirements led us to a choice of the bc-420  @xcite ( equivalent of ej-230  @xcite ) plastic scintillator as the most suitable among the currently available ones . the rise time and bulk attenuation length of light signals in this scintillator amount to 0.5  ns and 110  cm  @xcite , respectively .",
    "for the light detection , the hamamatsu r5320 photomultipliers  @xcite were chosen with the rise time and the transit time spread of 0.7  ns and 0.16  ns , respectively  @xcite .",

    "[ shapes ] is equal to about 1  ns , as expected from 0.5 ns rise time of a light pulse in the bc-420 scintillator convoluted with 0.7 ns rise time of signals from the hamamatsu r5320 photomultiplier .",
    "the decay time for the bc-420 scintillator amounts to 1.5  ns  @xcite . in a good approximation  @xcite an observed signal is a convolution of the gaussian and exponential functions and of the single photoelectron response of the photomultiplier .",
    "the single photoelectron signals were measured using a method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and values of a rise time of 0.7  ns and fwhm of 1.5  ns were observed in agreement with the values given in catalog  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have checked that the observed signals shown in fig .",
    "[ shapes ] are consistent with the expectation for the decay time of 1.5  ns .",

    "energy resolution depends predominantly on the number of photoelectrons released from photocathodes of both photomultipliers .",
    "the larger this number the better is the energy resolution due to decrease of the statistical fluctuation of the number of signal carriers .",
    "therefore , for the consideration of the energy resolution it is natural to express the energy deposition in terms of the number of photoelectrons and to use an arithmetic mean as a measure of the deposited energy : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote an energy calibration factor , and number of photoelectrons registered at left and right side of the scintillator , respectively . for scintillator detectors",
    "the fano factor is equal to one and therefore , in case of uncorrelated errors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 the fractional energy resolution would read : @xmath10 consequently , the energy resolution as a function of the deposited energy may be approximately parametrized as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an effective coefficient which in general may differ from @xmath13 .    ,",

    "the statistical uncertainties of simulated distributions are negligible .",
    "the fit was performed in the range from 90 to 150 photoelectrons .",

    "[ beta1 ] and  [ beta ] ) gives @xmath24 , where @xmath7 is estimated knowing that @xmath25  =  0.341  mev at the compton edge and that the corresponding mean value of photoelectrons from left and right photomultipliers amounts to about 138 ( see fig .",

    "the ratio of the area of the hole ( 0.28  mm@xmath26 ) and the side of the scintillator ( 95  mm@xmath26 ) was equal to about 340 , thus providing that for the typical event out of about 300 photons reaching the edge of the scintillator only zero , one or very rarely two photoelectrons were released from the photocathode . the experimental spectrum shown in fig .",

    "the dotted line denotes the theoretical distribution of the energy of electrons scattered via the compton effect by the gamma quantum with an energy of 511 kev .",
    "the observed number of photoelectrons is consistent with rough estimations of about 149 photoelectrons at the compton edge ( 0.341  mev ) which can be derived taking into account that ( i ) the light output of bc-420 scintillator equals to about 10,000 photons per mev  @xcite for electrons , ( ii ) the fraction of light which can be conducted via internal reflections to the edge in the rectangular strip surrounded by air is equal to about @xmath27  =  0.27 ( with refractive index n  =  1.58  @xcite ) , ( iii ) the quantum effciency of hamamatsu r5320 photomultipliers is equal to about 0.2  @xcite at 400 nm , and ( iv ) the bulk light attenuation length is equal to about 110  cm  @xcite where on the average the light travels about 23  cm from the center to the edge ( @xmath28  =  0.81 ) .    in case of the reconstruction of the tomographic image",
    "it was estimated that only signals with @xmath29  mev will be used in order to decrease the noise caused by the scattering of the annihilation quanta in the patient s body  @xcite . in the energy range from 0.2  mev to 0.34",

    "mev corresponds to about 81 photoelectrons . yet , in the further analysis , for conservative estimation of the time and position resolution we have selected signals with at least 75 photoelectrons .",

    "[ twoonone ] , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    as expected , due to the `` time walk '' effect the resolution determined when applying threshold at 250  mv is worse with respect to the one obtained at 50  mv .",

    "[ thrandfrac ] shows results obtained when determining the time at the constant fraction of the amplitude . from fig .",
    "[ thrandfrac ] one can infer that the time resolution is fairly independent of the irradiation position if time is determined for constant fraction of the amplitude as well as for low threshold at a constant level ( 50  mv ) .",
    "it is also visible that in the case of the larger threshold ( 250  mv ) resolutions become significantly worse at the edges of the scintillator strip which again is due to the `` time walk '' effect .",
    "the resolution of the time difference ( @xmath31 ) measurement at the center of the scintillator was determined to be @xmath33  ps both for constant level discrimination at 50  mv and constant fraction threshold of 10% of the amplitude .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is important to stress that results shown in figs .  [ twoonone ] and  [ thrandfrac ]",
    "were obtained taking into account only signals with the number of photoelectrons larger than 75 .",
    "this corresponds to the resolution of about 77  ps ( @xmath2 ) for the determination of the interaction moment ( @xmath34 ) which may be expressed as the average of times measured at the left and right photomultipliers independently of the hit position : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the effective velocity of the light signal inside the scintillator , and l and x were defined in fig .",

    "in the first approximation , a hit position along the scintillator strip may be determined based on the time difference of light signals arrival to the left and right photomultipliers using the following formula : @xmath38 which may be derived from the relation : @xmath39 thus the spatial resolution reads : @xmath40 the effective speed of light signals along a scintillator strip ( @xmath36 ) is smaller than the speed of light in a scintillator medium because most of photons do not travel to the photomultipliers directly but rather undergoes many internal reflections . in order to determine the effective speed of light signals in the tested scintillator",
    "the time difference @xmath41 was determined as a function of the irradiation position x , and @xmath36 was extracted by fitting a straight line to the experimental points .",
    "the determined value of @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ lineandcompar ] as a function of the applied threshold .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the change of @xmath36 with threshold is due to the `` walk effect '' and the variation of the average amplitude of signals as a function of the distance between the interaction point and photomultipliers . in order to suppress the bias of the determined @xmath36 due to the value of the applied threshold , the effective speed of light signals was determined by fitting the second order polynomial to the data points and extrapolating the fitted curve to the threshold of 0 mv , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lineandcompar ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to the extrapolation method was estimated as a difference in results between the fit with second and first order polynomials , and it was found to be negligible .",

    "the determined velocity is in the range of values obtained so far for signals in the plastic scintillator bars ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for the estimation of the position resolution we apply in equation  [ spatial ] the value of @xmath36  =  12.2  cm / ns and the value of @xmath44  =  153  ps both determined for the threshold of 50  mv . as a result a spatial resolution of @xmath45 is established for the determination of the interaction point of the annihilation quanta along the strip .",
    "properties of a single plastic scintillator module of the j - pet detector were investigated in view of the detection of annihilation gamma quanta with energy of 511 kev .",
    "the module was built out of bc-420 scintillator strip with dimensions of 5  mm x 19  mm x 300  mm which was read out at both sides by hamamatsu r5320 photomultipliers .",
