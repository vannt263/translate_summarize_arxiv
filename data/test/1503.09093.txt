    "it is usually possible to consider separately the vertical and radial structure of an accretion disk due to significantly different characteristic time - scales .",
    "in such a case the time - dependent radial structure of a disk can be described by a second - order partial differential equation , which is a consequence of the angular momentum and mass conservation .",

    "this is a diffusion type equation with a variable ` diffusion ' coefficient .",
    "choice of an analytic approach to solve the equation depends on the nature of the viscosity involved . the preferential way of describing viscosity in astrophysical disks , although not exclusive , is to use  @xcite , i.e. , the proportionality of the viscous stress tensor to the total pressure in the disk .",
    "one can generally assume that the kinematic viscosity @xmath4 is a product of two power functions : one function of radius and another of some local physical parameter , the latter usually represented by the surface density .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on the accretion disk are important .",
    "while the outer boundary can be a freely expanding surface due to the spreading of the matter corresponding to the outward viscous angular momentum flux , in some situations certain conditions should be posed at some distance from the accreting object .",
    "disks in the binary systems are the main focus for such models .    in a binary system , the tidal torques ,",

    "it is beleived that the mechanism of bursts in x - ray novae involves the thermal instability connected with opacity variations in the disks , as in dwarf novae . when a burst is ignited , and a sufficient portion of the disk is in the hot state , the viscous diffusion starts to govern the evolution , driving the characteristic rise and drop of the accretion rate onto the central object .",
    "it is a question , which probably allow no universal answer , why x - ray novae light curves have different profiles and pecularities .",

    ", one can explore the situation with an arbitrary initial distribution of the matter . actually , as we show in the present study after obtaining the green function , for realistic initial density distributions and for the case with the zero inner viscous stress , the evolution is generally a fred .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of the model with what happens in the @xmath3-disks , the prevalent model for the disks turbulence in the stellar binaries .",
    "the second case , when the viscous stress is non - zero at the center , applies to the disks with the central source of the angular momentum , e.g. , rotating stars with magnetosphers .",
