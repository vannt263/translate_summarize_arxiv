    "the current cosmological model assumes gaussian initial conditions , created by inflation .",

    "a non - gaussianity detection in the 1st year wmap data was reported by v03 . applying the smhw transform to the q - v - w coadded data , and computing the skewness and kurtosis of the wavelet coefficients over scales ranging from about 10 arcmins to 10 degrees",
    ", they found that the kurtosis of wavelet coefficients on scales @xmath5 was too high at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "it was found that the excess kurtosis was in the southern hemisphere , while the kurtosis signal in the northern hemisphere was consistent with gaussianity .",
    "the signal was shown to be independent of frequency .",
    "it is important to determine whether the significance of this non - gaussianity detection is affected by systematic effects , such as the choice of mask , or simplified assumptions about noise .",
    "since the spherical mexican hat wavelet transform is a sensitive probe of non - gaussianity , we use it to perform an independent analysis of the 1st year wmap data .",
    "the basic steps followed in the analysis are as follows : starting with the foreground cleaned q - v - w coadded data , we bring the map down in resolution to healpix @xmath6 , apply the @xmath7 we mean the @xmath7 mask without sources . ]",
    "mask , perform smhw transforms to obtain wavelet coefficients corresponding to the different scales @xmath8 ( also setting the monopole and dipole of the map to zero here ) , apply appropriately extended versions of the mask to the wavelet coefficients of each scale to exclude coefficients contaminated by the mask and known point sources , and compute the skewness and kurtosis of the remaining unmasked coefficients .",
    "for our results to be directly comparable we perform the smhw analysis for the same scales used by v03 . for convenience and clarity , the scales @xmath9 ( @xmath10=1,2, ... ,15 ) plotted in the subsequent figures",

    "we showed in  2 that the skewness signal obtained using a range of masks was consistent with gaussianity . in this section ,",
    "we use the skewness signal on the 15 scales to compute the limits that can be placed on the amplitude of primordial non - gaussianity , as parametrized by the non - linear coupling parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "since the non - linear term ( defined below ) is not dominant and is quadratic , it is the skewness signal in the data , rather than any higher order cumulants , that is expected to be most sensitive to it .",
    "the kurtosis signal is not sensitive to this kind of non - gaussianity ( cayon et al .",

    "the motivation to use data to place constraints on @xmath1 is to address how gaussian current cmb data are , or how much primordial non - gaussianity , of this particular form , is allowed by the data .",
    "such analyses also help compare the sensitivity of different data sets and of different estimators of non - gaussianity to this particular form of non - gaussianity .    using an optimal estimator of non - gaussianity based on the bispectrum , namely the cubic statistic , komatsu et al .",

    "we use the non - gaussian simulations of komatsu et al .",
    "how these have been produced are described in detail in the appendix of their paper . since producing these maps is a computationally intensive process , we use the 300 available realizations of non - gaussian sky maps at healpix resolution @xmath19=256 to obtain the mean values of skewness at each of the different scales , for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we use gaussian simulations to estimate the covariance matrix of the skewness values for the different scales , and thus in turn to estimate the uncertainty in the measured @xmath1 . since gaussian simulations can be computed several orders of magnitude in time faster",
    ", we can estimate the covariance matrix accurately using a larger number of gaussian simulations , and the uncertainty estimated from gaussian simulations is a good approximation to that estimated from non - gaussian simulations for @xmath20 uncertainty indicated by the different curves in figure 8 below are roughly the same indicating that at current sensitivity of the data the uncertainties do not depend on the precise best fit value of @xmath1 . ] .    in order to estimate the maximum likelihood @xmath1",
    ", we compare the skewness values of the data at the 15 scales with simulations and use the goodness of fit statistic @xmath21   \\sigma_{r_i , r_j}^{-1 } \\left [ s(r_j)-\\bar{s}_{sim}(r_j)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the skewness of wmap data on the ith scale @xmath9 , @xmath23 is the mean value from monte carlo simulations , computed for different values of @xmath1 , and @xmath24 is the scale - scale skewness covariance matrix from simulations .",
    "we have tested that the @xmath25 statistic accurately recovers @xmath1 by using it on simulated maps .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 8 .",
    "the figure shows the mean @xmath25 distributions obtained from 300 simulated realizations of non - gaussian maps with @xmath1 values of 50 , 100 and 150 .",
    "the simulations include noise and window functions of the wmap 1-yr data in the same as described earlier .",
    "a plot of @xmath25 values obtained using data for different @xmath1 is shown in figure 9 .",
    "plot is obtained from using a diagonal covariance matrix of the skewness values on different scales .",
    "1000 gaussian simulations may be too small to obtain convergence for the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix . however , as also discussed in eriksen et al .",
    "2003b , if we are interested in obtaining the probability of the data given the gaussian hypothesis , as was done in  2 of this paper , valid results can be obtained if we compute both the @xmath25 of the data and of the gaussian realizations using a diagonal covariance matrix .",
    "similarly a diagonal covariance matrix can be used here when we are interested in the relative change in @xmath25 with respect to a parameter . although we do obtain consistent limits on @xmath1 upon using the full covariance matrix . ]",
    "@xmath1 is thus estimated to be @xmath26 at 68% confidence , with 95% and 99% upper limits of 220 and 280 respectively .    the limits on @xmath1",
    "can also be checked using the fisher discriminant function ( barreiro & hobson 2001 , cayn et al .",
    "an optimal linear function of the measured variables ( here , skewness of wavelet coefficients on 15 different scales ) is @xmath27 here * x * is the 15 element vector that contains the skewness values at the different scales considered here , and @xmath28 is the fisher discriminant function that optimally puts together information contained in * x * in the sense of maximizing the difference between the expected mean values of @xmath29 from gaussian and non - gaussian models , and minimizing their dispersions .",
    "@xmath30 , the sum of the covariance matrices of the test statistic in the gaussian ( subscript 0 ) and non - gaussian ( subscript 1 ) cases . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are vectors containing the mean values of the test statistic in the gaussian and non - gaussian cases respectively .",
    "thus for different @xmath1 , the fisher discriminant function is found for each of the gaussian realizations , for each of the non - gaussian realizations , and for the data . the probability that the data are drawn from one or the other hypothesis",
    "can then be estimated .",
    "looking at the fraction of non - gaussian simulations that have values larger ( for positive @xmath1 ) and smaller ( for negative @xmath1 ) we deduce similar limits on @xmath1 as derived above using the @xmath25 test .",
    "barreiro & hobson ( 2001 ) found that the fisher discriminant can do better than @xmath25 s at distinguishing between gaussian and non - gaussian hypotheses .",
    "however since we have only 300 non - gaussian simulations to obtain the fractions from , the accuracy of this method is not better but just comparable for our case here .",
    "figure 10 shows the histograms of the fisher discriminants of 1000 gaussian realizations , of 300 non - gaussian realizations and of the data , for @xmath1 values of 120 and 250 ; these values are close to the the 1@xmath17 and 2@xmath17 limits derived using the @xmath25 above .",
    "for these values of @xmath1 , 0.74 and 0.95 of the non - gaussian simulations , respectively , have larger values of the fisher discriminant than the data .",
    "we see that results obtained using fisher discriminants are consistent with those obtained using the @xmath25 test values of 120 , 250 , 350 , and 500,respectively , at the 95% confidence level .",
    "these fractions are approximate as they have been obtained using only 300 non - gaussian realizations . ] .",
    "we note that if the skewness signal in the data showed deviations from gaussianity on particular scales then this method involving wavelet transforms could be used to obtain scale dependent constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "however the skewness signal in the data is well consistent with gaussianity .",
    "the skewness spectrum of fig 1(a ) really flattens out with the use of another mask , such as the one used in fig 4(a ) , while the kurtosis signal remains unchanged .",
    "thus we do not believe there is reason to distinguish between different scales in obtaining constraints on @xmath1 here .",
    "also , the constraints on @xmath1 derived here could possibly be made more stringent if we used the above method on the wiener filtered map of primordial perturbations as discussed in komatsu , spergel & wandelt ( 2003 ) .",
    "we will explore this in a future paper .",
    "we have analysed the first year wmap data using a spherical mexican hat wavelet .",
    "we detect non - gaussianity at @xmath33 99% significance , consistent with that reported by vielva et al .",
    "this detection corresponds to a positive kurtosis and to the presence of a larger than expected number of cold pixels ( wavelet coefficients ) in the southern galactic hemisphere on scales @xmath34 .",
    "we have tested for changes in the significance of the signal with the type of mask used .",
    "the signal is found to be robust , and is found in the ilc map as well .",
