    "supernova ( sn ) light curves are one of the major sources of information about the nature of these events .",
    "they infer structures of the stellar progenitors and reflect the underlying energy sources created in the explosion .",
    "direct comparison of peak luminosities and multiband light curves with the predictions of theoretical models lead to better understanding of the physics of supernova explosion .",
    "light curves of thermonuclear supernovae ( sne ia ) are now the primary tool for the study of precise cosmology @xcite .",
    "we have been engaged in systematic optical monitoring of bright sne in nearby galaxies ( z@xmath00.01 ) .",
    "the photometric system we use is part of 15-filter intermediate - band system designed to cover the wavelength range 3300 @xmath1- 1@xmath2 m , which avoids known and variable sky emission .",
    "a description of this unique photometric system , also dubbed the batc system , are detailed elsewhere @xcite . by using the intermediate - band filters we may learn more about sn light curves .",
    "in particular , we could explore the evolution of some spectrum lines during sn explosion through spectrophotometry . here",
    "we report our initial results of the intermediate - band sn photometry program .",
    "in figure 1 , we present the intermediate - band light curves of five sne ia .",
    "they are sn 2002er in ugc 10743 , sn 2002fk in ngc 1309 , sn 2003cg in ngc 3169 , sn 2003du in ugc 9391 , and 2003kf in mcg-02 - 16 - 002 . observations of these sne were made near maximum light in several batc filters ( e.g. @xmath3th , @xmath4th , @xmath5th , @xmath6th , and @xmath7th filters that centered on 4550@xmath1 , 6075@xmath1 , 6660@xmath1 , 7490@xmath1 and 8480@xmath1 respectively ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the light curves of sne ia in d and h filters resembles those in b and v except for a decrease of the decline after maximum .",
    "the secondary peak feature was observed in batc s redder light curves .",
    "the most pronounced feature presents in k band , where no prominent spectrum line emerges during the second peak period .",
    "it is therefore that the occurrence of the secondary peak is not due to the spectral feature but it is likely due to the time evolution of line opacities @xcite    -0.7 cm 7.0 and + 7.0 days.,title=\"fig:\",width=495 ] -0.6 cm    -0.2 cm [ fig1 ]    nevertheless , the diversity of the light curves in several of batc s passbands is readily apparent .",
    "the differences are most pronounced in i band ( and possibly in k band ) , where the differences in magnitude decline after maximum could reach @xmath80.5 mag at epoch of 30 days and reach @xmath81.0 mag at 60 days even without including sn 2003cg .",
    "we considered sn 2003cg as an intrinsically subluminous sn ia for two reasons .",
    "first , the shoulder or secondary peak appears to be missing for sn 2003cg in i and k light curves .",
    "this feature is absent for sn 1991bg - like sn ia events such as sne 1997cn @xcite , 1999by @xcite .",
    "second , the light curves of sn 2003cg near maximum light are much narrower than normal sne ia ( see fig 1 ) . on the other hand , sn 2003kf seems to be an luminous sn ia .",
    "the light curves of sn 2003kf in d band declined by 0.68@xmath90.02 mag in the first 15 days after maximum , while the counter value of sn 2002er is 1.03@xmath90.03 mag and its @xmath10@xmath11 is reported to be 1.33@xmath90.04 @xcite .",
    "one merit of using batc s filters is that they may properly cover the broad spectral lines of sne at proper redshift .",
    "for instance , the h filter may cover si ii @xmath126355 ( blueshifted to 6150@xmath1 ) and the n filter may cover caii ir triplets for nearby sne ia at @xmath13 .",
    "thus we can gain some knowledge about the evolution of some feature lines of supernovae from the corresponding intermediate - band light curves .",
    "figure 2 shows the flux ratio of h band vs. i band and n band vs. k band .",
    "f(6075)/f(6660 ) may indicate the variation of siii@xmath126355 while f(8480)/f(7490 ) may reflect the evolution of caii ir triplet during the explosion .",
    "the observations discussed here are part of our intermediate - band photometric program on bright sne .",
    "the intermediate - band photometric data of a total 20 sn sample are being analyzed for further publication ( wang et al .",
