    "quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , strongly interacting matter composed of quarks and gluons , has been created in high - energy nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern  @xcite .",
    "one of the main discoveries at the rhic was that the qgp behaves like a nearly perfect fluid  @xcite , and since then the transport properties of the qgp , especially its shear and bulk viscosity coefficients , have been under active investigation .    the qgp created in high - energy nuclear collisions expands , cools down , and turns into a hadron gas . since hadrons scatter with each other via the strong interaction , information about the qgp stage is , in general , contaminated by rescatterings in the hadronic stage . to probe the qgp",
    "more directly , thermal photons and dileptons were proposed as penetrating probes  @xcite .",
    "once emitted , photons and dileptons propagate to detectors without rescattering since they interact only electromagnetically and their mean free path is therefore longer than the typical size of the system .",
    "however , photons and dileptons are not perfect probes of the qgp either .",
    "they are emitted during all the stages of high - energy nuclear collisions such as the primary hard scatterings , pre - equilibrium stage , and late hadronic stage  @xcite , and it is not possible to distinguish photons and dileptons emitted from the qgp from those originating from the other processes .    in this paper , we follow up the previous studies  @xcite about multistrange hadrons , and claim that their distributions allow to probe the qgp immediately after hadronization .",
    "multistrange hadrons , in particular @xmath0 mesons and @xmath1 baryons , have small scattering cross - sections with pions since they do not form any resonances unlike other hadrons .",
    "this is a unique property of the multistrange hadrons : their distributions reflect the properties of the system mainly at a specific stage deep inside the fireball , unlike photons and dileptons which come from the all stages .    by using a hybrid model in which hydrodynamic description of the qgp fluid",
    "is followed by a hadronic cascade model , violation of the mass ordering of the differential elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 was predicted  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was observed recently by the star collaboration @xcite , which indicates that @xmath0 mesons are less affected by hadronic rescatterings and , consequently , that they are good probes deep inside the matter . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the hadronic rescattering effects on observables more systematically by employing an integrated dynamical approach which we have previously used to analyze various observables at the rhic and the lhc energies  @xcite . in the previous study of the violation of mass",
    "ordering  @xcite , a first order phase transition model for the equation of state ( eos ) was employed and only hadrons up to the mass of @xmath3 were taken into account in the hadron phase . in the present paper , we use a more realistic equation of state  @xcite connecting a parametrized lattice qcd eos at large temperatures to a hadron resonance gas eos at low temperatures .",
    "the hadron resonance gas in the eos contains all the resonances in the hadron cascade model jam ( jet @xmath4 microscopic transport model )  @xcite used as the last stage of the integrated dynamical approach .",
    "hence , in addition to @xmath0 , we are able to investigate hadronic rescattering effects on heavier multistrange hadrons such as @xmath5 and @xmath1 .    in the following",
    "we introduce the integrated dynamical model in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] .",
    "we compare transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) spectra and @xmath6-differential elliptic flow parameters @xmath7 with the star data in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "after we confirm we reasonably reproduce the data by using this model , we discuss the hadronic rescattering effect in sec .",
    "[ sec : rescatteringeffects ] .",
    "in this section , we first revisit the violation of mass ordering of @xmath7 .",
    "we next focus on the mean transverse momentum @xmath8 and @xmath9-averaged @xmath10 calculated with or without hadronic rescatterings and investigate how much these final observables reflect the information when the hydrodynamic stage finishes .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we describe the space - time evolution of high - energy nuclear collisions by an integrated dynamical approach on an event - by - event basis .",
    "we divide the whole reaction into three separate stages : initial stage , hydrodynamic stage , and transport stage .",
    "the initial entropy density distribution after the collision of energetic heavy nuclei is parametrized by using a monte - carlo version of the glauber model .",
    "the subsequent expansion of the matter is described by relativistic ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "when the system becomes sufficiently dilute due to strong expansion , we switch the description of the system from hydrodynamics to kinetic theory .    in the following we briefly overview each part of the model and the corresponding interfaces . for further details , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics is a macroscopic description and an effective theory of the system s long wavelength / time behavior .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations of motion are obtained from the conservation of energy and momentum : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is energy - momentum tensor . in the ideal fluid approximation",
    ", the energy momentum tensor can be decomposed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are energy density , pressure , flow velocity , and the minkowski metric , respectively . to close the system of partial differential equations we need to know the equation of state ( eos ) of the fluid to obtain pressure @xmath15 as a function of energy density @xmath14 .",
    "once the eos is known , the space - time evolution of thermodynamic quantities and flow velocity is determined for given initial conditions , i.e. , energy density distribution and flow field at initial time @xmath18 .",
    "we ignore the baryon number and its continuity equation since at the collider energies , net baryon density at midrapidity is tiny .",
    "when we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) , temperature is not needed since it is merely a parameter to connect energy density and pressure .",
    "nevertheless , we also follow the space - time evolution of temperature to decide where to switch from fluid to cascade .",
    "we employ the _",
    "s95p_-v1.1 parametrization for the eos .",
    "the _ s95p _",
    "parametrization  @xcite connects the lattice qcd based eos  @xcite in the high temperature region to a hadron resonance gas eos in the low temperature region . the hadronic part of _ s95p_-v1.1 contains the same hadronic species as the jam hadronic cascade model  @xcite described in the next subsection .",
    "we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) in the milne coordinates @xmath19 which is appropriate for the description of the evolution at relativistic energies @xcite . here",
    "@xmath20 is longitudinal proper time , @xmath21 $ ] is space - time rapidity , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are transverse coordinates perpendicular to the collision axis . in the numerical calculations , we employ the piecewise parabolic method @xcite which is known to be able to describe shock waves . for details about this numerical algorithm ,",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we employ the hadronic cascade model jam @xcite to describe the space - time evolution of hadron gas after  particlization \" ,",
    "i.e. , after switching from fluid to particles .",
    "at the late stage of collisions , the system is too dilute to maintain equilibrium .",
    "we assume this happens around temperature , which we call the switching temperature @xmath24 , and switch description from hydrodynamics to kinetic theory on @xmath25 isosurface @xcite . within the current model",
    ", @xmath24 is rather adjustable parameter which controls the final particle ratios .",
    "we choose @xmath26 mev to reproduce the observed @xmath27 spectra of pions , kaons , and protons + anti - protons in the low @xmath27 region @xcite at the full rhic energy . at @xmath28 , we calculate the single particle phase space distributions @xmath29 for all hadrons included in the eos by employing the cooper - frye prescription  @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a degeneracy of the hadronic species @xmath32 , @xmath33 is four - momentum of a particle , and @xmath34 is a normal vector of the @xmath28 hypersurface .",
    "it is well known that at some momenta the cooper - frye formula ( [ eq : cf ] ) gives negative contribution for space - like hypersurface element ( or even time - like hypersurface element with negative time component ) .",
    "these negative numbers correspond to in - coming particles , which one can not treat in the hadronic cascade model .",
    "so we just neglect these contributions and consider only out - going particles .",
    "we sample particles by going through all the hypersurface elements and generate ensembles of hadrons on an event - by - event basis .",
    "note that we do not oversample particles to gain statistics for each event .",
    "this means each hydrodynamic event corresponds to one ensemble of particles . among all the calculations in the integrated dynamical approach",
    ", sampling particles from particlization hypersurface is numerically most expensive , which is crucial in event - by - event simulations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed in detail how to sample particles and integrate the cooper - frye formula ( [ eq : cf ] ) over momentum at less numerical cost .    in hadronic cascade models ,",
    "experimental hadronic cross section data are implemented when available .",
    "however , there are many hadronic scattering processes where data do not exist . in such a case",
    ", we use the additive quark model @xcite to describe the scattering cross section @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the total nucleon - nucleon cross section , @xmath37 is the number of constituent quarks in a hadron , and @xmath38 is the number of strange quarks in a hadron . thus hadrons containing strange quark(s ) have relatively small total cross section in this model .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 mesons and @xmath1 baryons do not form resonances when scattering with pions and therefore have much smaller cross sections than non - strange hadrons .    in the simulations , dynamics of the system",
    "is described by a sum of incoherent two - body collisions .",
    "two particles collide with each other if their minimum distance @xmath39 in the center of mass frame is smaller than the distance given by the total cross section @xmath40 this is a classical , geometrical interpretation of the two - body collision cross section .",
    "note that in jam the properties of hadrons are those of free particles .",
    "the medium modifications of hadron properties such as a broadening and mass shift  @xcite have been extensively studied by various further developments of transport models such as the relativistic vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( rvuu ) model  @xcite , the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd  @xcite ) and parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd  @xcite ) transport models , the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu )  @xcite , and the isospin quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since the main difference in the cross sections of multistrange particles and the other hadrons is due to the ( non-)existence of resonance channels , we do not expect the in - medium modifications to significantly affect this difference , and the use of free particle properties to provide a conservative baseline is justified .",
    "as mentioned , the interactions in jam are described as two particle scatterings , and multi - particle scatterings are not included .",
    "it has been argued that multi - pion fusion processes in particular would have a significant effect on the yields of proton - antiproton pairs  @xcite , but subsequent calculations have shown that regeneration is a @xmath41% level effect at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the multi - meson fusion effects for @xmath1 baryons are much smaller than for protons or @xmath42  @xcite , and thus their inclusion would make the later - discussed differences between rescatterings of non - strange and multistrange particles even larger .    as a default setting strong interactions and decays",
    "are simulated in jam .",
    "however , we switch off the decay channels for @xmath0 mesons in the present study to investigate hadronic rescattering effects on @xmath0 mesons in an efficient way .",
    "otherwise , we would need to perform mass reconstruction of @xmath0 mesons from two kaons after numerical simulations . since the lifetime of @xmath0 mesons (",
    "@xmath43 fm/@xmath44 ) @xcite is somewhat larger than the typical life time of the system ( @xmath41 fm/@xmath44 ) , the daughter kaons from @xmath0 meson decays ( or lack of them ) are not expected to affect the bulk evolution . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the yield of @xmath42 measured by star contains the feed down from electromagnetic @xmath45 decays .",
    "this process does not happen in the default setting in jam and , therefore , is simulated separately when we analyze @xmath42 spectra .",
    "we also have an option in jam to deactivate all the hadronic rescatterings and/or resonance decays to investigate how these affect final observables .",
    "once initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution are fixed , the subsequent evolution is determined , and we are able to obtain final particle distributions which can be compared with experimental data .",
    "the pre - thermalization stage between the first contact of colliding nuclei and the initial time of hydrodynamic evolution may be described by non - equilibrium field theory , although how exactly it could be done is one of the open issues in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "thus , we do not even try to describe it and simply rely on the monte - carlo ( mc ) glauber  @xcite and the modified brodsky - gunion - kuhn ( bgk ) models  @xcite to give the density distribution at @xmath18 in the transverse plane and in the longitudinal direction , respectively .",
    "the mc glauber model enables us to calculate the number density of participants and of binary collisions on an event - by - event basis .",
    "our assumption is that the initial entropy density is proportional to a linear combination of these two densities . even at very high collision energies matter profile in the longitudinal direction",
    "depends on space - time rapidity , and boost invariance does not hold .",
    "furthermore , in non - central collisions the longitudinal density gradient at mid space - time rapidity may be non - zero due to the different thicknesses of the colliding nuclei at each transverse position .",
    "this can be deduced from ( pseudo-)rapidity distribution of hadrons in p(d)-a collisions . in the modified bgk model smooth initial longitudinal profile",
    "is parametrized by taking account of the difference in the local thickness of colliding nuclei .",
    "it is noted that we do not employ the monte - carlo kharzeev - levin - nardi model  @xcite which was used to calculate initial conditions in our previous hydrodynamic studies  @xcite since , in the present study , we focus on the hadronic rescattering effects on transverse dynamics , which are not supposed to be sensitive to the choice of initial conditions .    assuming local thermalization , energy density distribution @xmath46 and pressure @xmath47",
    "are obtained from the entropy density distribution through the _",
    "s95p_-v1.1 eos .",
    "initial flow velocity at @xmath48 is supposed to be bjorken s scaling flow @xcite , namely , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . throughout this study",
    ", we fix @xmath51 fm/@xmath44 .",
    "we choose initial parameters to reproduce the @xmath27 distributions of pions , kaons , and protons + anti - protons in au+au collisions at @xmath52 gev measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "the centrality dependence of multiplicity is controlled by a fraction of soft ( participants ) and hard ( binary collisions ) component in the mc glauber model , whereas the multiplicity in central collisions is fixed by the overall normalization parameter of the initial entropy distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned particle ratios are controlled by the switching temperature .",
    "the parameters controlling the shape of the rapidity distribution of particles are kept the same as in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "since here we concentrate on observables at midrapidity , we do not discuss them further .    in hydrodynamic simulations , one needs to convert the position distribution ( a sum of delta functions in the transverse plane ) of collision points in mc glauber model to a hydrodynamic density distribution . in our model",
    "we obtain the density at a point @xmath22 by counting the number of collision points or participants within radius @xmath53 around the point , and divide by the inelastic cross section in @xmath54+@xmath54 collisions at @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 .",
    "for further details , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we compare invariant @xmath6 spectra and differential elliptic flow parameter @xmath57 of identified hadrons with experimental data from the star collaboration . in the present study , we analyzed 0.6 million `` minimum bias '' events ( defined as @xmath58 in the mc glauber calculations for hydrodynamic initial conditions ) .",
    "centrality is defined using an event distribution of the charged hadron multiplicity in @xmath59 as done by the star collaboration  @xcite .",
    "note that error bars in the theoretical plots denote the statistical errors .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : dist_pi&k ] , [ fig : dist_pro&phi ] , and [ fig : dist_hyperon ] , we show @xmath6 distributions of identified hadrons around midrapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath60 . for clarity ,",

    "figure  [ fig : dist_pi&k ] shows the @xmath27 spectra of ( a ) positive pions ( @xmath61 ) and ( b ) positive kaons ( @xmath62 ) compared with the star data ( @xmath63 for pions  @xcite and @xmath64 for kaons  @xcite ) .",
    "the jacobian between @xmath65 and @xmath23 is taken into account to obtain the invariant @xmath6 spectra in our results .",
    "even if we tuned the initial conditions and the switching temperature in the model using pion , kaon , and proton + anti - proton @xmath27 spectra from the phenix collaboration in our previous study , the results are overall in good agreement with the star data too .",
    "in particular , the model reproduces the pion data up to @xmath66 gev/@xmath44 in central ( 0 - 12% ) collisions . above this",
    ", our result gradually deviates from the data due to appearance of ( semi-)hard components such as recombination and jet fragmentation .",
    "the more peripheral the collision , the lower the @xmath6 where our result begins to deviate from the data . due to the limited @xmath6 range of the data ,",
    "the same behavior is not seen in the kaon spectra .",
    "if one looks at the pion spectrum in peripheral collisions ( 60 - 80% centrality ) carefully , one sees that experimental data are systematically larger than the results .",
    "this is because in peripheral collisions there is a small discrepancy between phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite pion yields .",
    "nevertheless we did not further tune the parameters to reproduce the star data because we want to keep the same framework as in our previous study  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_pro&phi ] , we compare the @xmath27 spectra in @xmath61 for ( a ) protons and ( b ) @xmath0 mesons with the star data @xcite .",
    "due to limited statistics , we do not show some data points of the proton spectra in high @xmath27 regions ( above @xmath67 gev/@xmath44 ) in 20 - 40 , 40 - 60 , and 60 - 80% centrality .",
    "the proton spectra from star are corrected for the @xmath42 and @xmath68 feed down .",
    "weak decays do not occur in the default setting in jam , so we are able to compare our results directly with the star corrected data . since we neglect baryon chemical potential in our model , our results for protons are slightly below the experimental data at some @xmath27 range . nevertheless , overall slopes are in good agreement with the data below @xmath66 gev/@xmath44 . on the other hand , similar to pions , deviation between the experimental data and the results gradually increases with @xmath27 , and the more peripheral the collision , the lower the @xmath9 where this deviation appears . as mentioned in the previous section , we switch off the decays of @xmath0 mesons in the hadronic cascade to be able to analyze @xmath0 meson spectra directly without resorting to mass reconstruction from kaons .",
    "tendencies seen in @xmath0 meson spectra are similar to those in proton spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist_hyperon ] shows the @xmath27 spectra of strange baryons , ( a ) @xmath69 , ( b ) @xmath70 , and ( c ) @xmath71 , compared with the star data  @xcite .",
    "similar to the proton case , the more peripheral the collisions , the worse the agreement between experimental data and the results , especially above @xmath72 - 2.0 gev/@xmath44 . as expected the measured @xmath42 and @xmath5 yields are larger than the calculated yields .",
    "we had chosen the switching temperature @xmath24 to reproduce the observed pion to kaon and pion to proton ratios , which leads to a lower temperature than the statistical model fit to all observed hadrons  @xcite , and thus to lower yields of hyperons .",
    "on the other hand it has been argued that the statistical model @xcite with the common chemical freezeout temperature does not reproduce the proton and @xmath42 yields simultaneously at the lhc and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "it was claimed  @xcite that earlier switching from hydrodynamics to urqmd at energy density @xmath73 mev/@xmath74 , which corresponds to higher temperature than @xmath75 mev , would be a key to resolve the issue , but our results do not improve significantly if we use higher switching temperature @xmath76 mev .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the origin of this discrepancy lies in a different description of the proton - antiproton annihilations in jam and urqmd cascades , or in different expansion dynamics in collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "note that the experimental yield of @xmath42 in star contains the feed down from electromagnetic @xmath77 decays ( @xmath78 )  @xcite . since this is the dominant mode of @xmath45 decay with the branching ratio @xmath79 and @xmath80 m  @xcite , the feed down correction of it is experimentally challenging . we simulate this decay in jam and include this contribution in the final @xmath42 spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_hyperon ] ( a ) .",
    "since the mass of @xmath45 is close to that of @xmath42 , the yield of the primordial @xmath45 is expected to be of the same order as the yield of the primordial @xmath42 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath77 to @xmath42 at switching temperature can be estimated as @xmath81 after correcting for the effects of resonance decay and rescatterings , we find that the final particle ratio of @xmath77 to @xmath42 is around 0.3 .",
    "we have included both sources of @xmath42 in our results , but in general this should be kept in mind when comparing theoretical results with the data .",
    "although the number of data points from star is limited for @xmath1 baryons , their yields and slopes are consistent with our results .",
    "it is worth noticing here that the recent lattice qcd calculations suggest the existence of resonances in general  @xcite , or strange baryon resonances in particular  @xcite , which have not been discovered yet .",
    "such resonances , whether they are of hagedorn kind  @xcite , or those predicted by quark models ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , would contribute to the yields of strange hadrons , and might somewhat change the dynamics of the late hadronic stage  @xcite .",
    "some of those resonances could be formed in the scattering of @xmath0 mesons or @xmath1 baryons , but it is unknown whether such resonances would significantly affect the average scattering cross section of @xmath0 mesons and @xmath1 baryons in temperatures below the switching temperature .",

    "( [ eq : v2slope ] ) holds exactly .",
    "thus a change of slope in @xmath57 due to hadronic rescatterings could be attributed to changes of @xmath10 and/or @xmath8 , which provides us with more intuitive understanding .",
    "we next calculate @xmath8 and @xmath6-averaged @xmath108 for each identified hadron in @xmath109 in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath96 with the three different options mentioned above .",
    "we show @xmath8 and @xmath108 as functions of hadron mass in figs .",
    "[ fig : pt&v2_versus_mass ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "default results using the option ( i ) are shown with closed squares . to see the effect of hadronic rescatterings , we use the option ( ii ) in the hadronic cascade calculation .",
    "we also use the option ( iii ) to obtain the results excluding the contributions of both hadronic rescatterings and resonance decays . in the default option ( i ) in which both hadronic rescatterings and resonance decays are included , @xmath8 is not a linear function of the hadron mass . by switching off hadronic rescatterings by employing the option ( ii ) , we are able to extract the hadronic rescattering effects on evolution of mean @xmath6 in the late hadronic stage .",
    "the difference of @xmath8 between with and without hadronic rescatterings are relatively smaller for @xmath110 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 than for the others . in order to confirm a pure flow effect",
    "we also calculate @xmath8 with option ( iii ) in which resonance decay contributions are also not included . as is well - known in analysis using the blast wave model @xcite",
    ", @xmath8 is a linear function of the hadron mass in this case @xcite .",
    "we also confirm that it is the case even in our fully dynamical calculations .",
    "@xmath6-averaged @xmath10 for three options ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are compared with each other in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt&v2_versus_mass ] ( b ) . by comparing the results ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "one finds that due to hadronic rescatterings @xmath10 for hadrons other than pions increases little  by at most @xmath1036%  but @xmath10 for pions increases by @xmath10325 even though elliptic flow parameters are commonly believed to be sensitive to the early stage of the reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of hadronic rescattering on pion mean @xmath27 is almost absent @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effect of resonance decays on pion @xmath10 is also significant , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pt&v2_versus_mass ] ( b ) .",
    "how resonance decays reduce pion @xmath10 was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we expected , neither @xmath111 nor @xmath10 for multistrange hadrons is affected by hadronic rescatterings , but at least one of these observables is affected for all other particles .    to see how much hadronic rescatterings affect the final observables , we show ratios of @xmath8 and @xmath10 at particlization but after decays ( option ( ii ) ) to the ones in the final state ( option ( i ) ) @xcite for each identified hadron in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratio ] .",
    "for comparison , we also show the ratio obtained from a @xmath112 scaling ansatz ( open square ) @xcite in the case of mean @xmath6 . in this ansatz , one can parametrize @xmath6 distribution as @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are freeze - out temperature , particle mass , and flow velocity , respectively .",
    "parameters were chosen to reproduce the slope of the proton @xmath6 spectrum in option ( ii ) ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) and in option ( i ) ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "if all the particles interact strongly with each other and move at a common collective velocity during the hadronic stage , mass ordering would appear .",
    "in fact , the result from the @xmath112 scaling depends monotonically on particle mass , and pions , kaons , and protons follow this monotonic tendency obtained from @xmath112 scaling ansatz .",
    "however , multistrange hadrons ( including `` hidden '' strangeness ) ( @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 ) in the integrated dynamical approach deviate from the pattern .",
    "this means that multistrange hadrons freeze out earlier than other hadrons and do not participate in the radial flow during the transport stage .",
    "multistrange hadrons couple weakly with the system consisting mostly of pions since they have small scattering cross sections and hardly rescatter with pions in the late hadronic stage .",
    "mean transverse momentum @xmath8 for dominant constituents of the medium , namely pions , decreases during the hadronic rescattering stage since @xmath121 work done in the longitudinal direction reduces the transverse energy per unit rapidity  @xcite but the number of pions is fixed . in this way , @xmath122 in fact , the two parameter sets in the @xmath112 scaling ansatz mentioned above are chosen to obey this inequality ( [ eq : meanptineq ] ) .",
    "as for @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ( b ) , about 20% of final @xmath10 of pions is generated during the late transport stage .",
    "in other words , only @xmath10380% of final @xmath10 reflects elliptic flow generated during the fluid - dynamical stage .",
    "obviously , this could depend on centrality ( and perhaps collision energy ) and the number can be regarded as an average value at the rhic energy . whereas hadronic rescatterings affect little final @xmath10 for the other hadrons . by combining these two results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , we conclude that multistrange hadrons are less affected by hadronic rescatterings and , therefore , can be used to probe the hadronization stage in high - energy nuclear collisions .    coming back to violation of mass ordering in differential @xmath10 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2_noscat_scat ] and also in fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can interpret this intriguing phenomenon as follows .",
    "for pions @xmath6-averaged @xmath10 increases but @xmath8 changes little in the hadronic stage , so slope of @xmath123 gets steeper as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2slope ] ) . on the other hand , for protons ,",
    "@xmath6-averaged @xmath10 does not change so much , but @xmath8 increases in the hadronic stage , so @xmath102 decreases .",
    "however , for @xmath0 mesons , both @xmath6-averaged @xmath10 and @xmath8 after the hydrodynamic stage are almost the same in the final state and , consequently , @xmath124 is unchanged .",
    "finally we show the normalized freeze - out time ( defined as the longitudinal proper time @xmath125 of the last interaction in hadronic cascade simulations ) distributions around mid - rapidity ( @xmath126 ) in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath127 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndtau ] the results are shown in two panels , ( a ) for mesons and ( b ) for baryons , for clarity .",
    "the shaded areas represent the particlization time distribution for charged hadrons .",
    "since the particlization time does not depend on scattering cross sections , it is almost equal for all hadrons within error bars .",
    "a prominent peak with small width is seen below @xmath128 fm/@xmath44 , corresponding to the time of particlization at different parts of the system .",
    "the freeze - out time distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not differ from the particlization time distribution significantly , which reflects their small scattering cross sections . on the other hand ,",
    "other hadrons have broader freeze - out time distributions . for @xmath5 ,",
    "a peak also exists at an early time like for @xmath0 and @xmath1 but its height is lower and the peak is accompanied by a broad tail .",
    "this is because @xmath5 has a contribution from long - living resonance @xmath5(1530 ) ( decay width @xmath129 mev @xmath103 1/(20 fm/@xmath44 ) @xcite ) whose decay forms a long tail in the freeze - out time distribution .",
    "so the primordial @xmath5 freezes out as early as @xmath0 and @xmath1 do .",
    "these results support our findings above that multistrange hadrons freeze out just after the particlization due to less rescatterings in the late kinetic stage .",
    "we have studied the effects of the hadronic rescatterings especially on multistrange hadrons and claimed they can be used to probe the hadronization stage in high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we have employed an integrated dynamical model in which the ideal hydrodynamic model is combined with the hadronic cascade model , jam , and confirmed that our model fairly reproduces the experimental data of @xmath6 spectra and differential @xmath10 not only for pions , kaons , and protons but also for multistrange hadrons . within this approach",
    ", we have simulated the hadronic stage with or without the rescatterings and compared the calculated mean transverse momentum and @xmath6-averaged @xmath10 in these two cases to investigate the hadronic rescattering effects .",
    "we have found that the multistrange hadrons are less affected by the rescatterings than non - strange hadrons .",
    "because of the small scattering cross sections , the multistrange hadrons do not fully participate in the radial flow during the hadronic stage and freeze out earlier than non - strange hadrons . with these results",
    "we have shown how to interpret behaviors of mass ordering and its violation in @xmath7 .",
    "changes of slope of @xmath7 during the hadronic rescattering stage result from interplay between changes of mean @xmath6 and @xmath6-averaged @xmath108 .",
    "we have also showed the freeze - out time distributions for identified hadrons and confirmed that the multistrange hadrons freeze out soon after they are `` particlized '' .    in future , we also plan to investigate the hadronic rescattering effects on observables for multistrange hadrons at the lhc energy .",
    "although elliptic flow parameters are expected to be less affected by the hadronic rescatterings at the lhc , it would be important to quantify how much they do change , and thus how much the observed @xmath108 at lhc reflects the qgp evolution .",
