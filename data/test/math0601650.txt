    "active magnetic bearings ( ambs ) are being employed in a variety of rotating machines ( e.g. , compressors , milling spindles , and flywheels ) in place of conventional mechanical bearings . due to the non - contact nature of the magnetic bearings and rotor ,",
    "ambs have the unique ability to suspend loads with no friction , operate rotors at higher speeds , and operate in applications where the use of lubricants is prohibited .",
    "since ambs can be actively controlled , they offer other potential advantages over mechanical bearings , viz . , the elimination of vibration through active damping , the adjustment of the stiffness of the suspended load , and the automatic balancing of rotors .",
    "ambs are normally operated with all electromagnets active at all times .",
    "an alternative mode of operation is to activate only one electromagnet along each direction at any given time .",
    "although posing more difficulty to the control design , this switching operation prevents opposing electromagnets from producing counteracting forces , and thus helps reduce power consumption .    typically , an amb is operated by introducing a sufficiently high , fixed magnetic flux in each electromagnet , which is referred to as the _ bias flux_. the bias value is normally set to a fraction of the saturation flux of the electromagnet .",
    "this procedure facilitates the design of the amb ` control ' flux , which is superimposed on the bias flux .",
    "specifically , this conservative practice allows the system to be modeled by a controllable linear system , thus , enabling the use of linear control design techniques ; see for example @xcite .",
    "although the bias flux facilitates the control synthesis , it increases electric power losses in the amb system , causing rotor heating and affecting the machine efficiency .",
    "while lowering or eliminating the bias flux is desirable in order to minimize power losses , it enhances the amb  system nonlinearities and may lead to a control saturation or singularity . due to these conflicting objectives ,",
    "the design of amb  controllers with reduced power loss is a challenging problem .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of low - bias control of ambs operating in the switching mode with the constraint that the input voltages are amplitude limited .",
    "this problem was previously addressed in @xcite using the nested saturation design method of teel @xcite .",
    "in addition , an optimal solution was sought to the power - loss minimization problem under voltage saturation in @xcite .",
    "( a  comprehensive literature review of low- , asymptotic - zero- , and zero - bias amb  controllers _ without _ voltage saturation can be found in @xcite . ) here , we pursue a different approach to stabilizing the amb model of @xcite .",
    "namely , we use a _ forwarding - like _ method @xcite to design a control law of arbitrarily small amplitude that renders the amb system globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) to the origin .",
    "the main differences between our approach and @xcite are : ( i ) we allow the use of different saturation functions ( both ` hard ' and ` soft ' ) , thus providing more flexibility in the control implementation , and ( ii ) we provide an explicit construction for a ` global ' control lyapunov function ( clf ) for the system .",
    "this contrasts with the result of @xcite , which relies on the standard ` hard ' saturation and whose lyapunov - like function is only an ` asymptotic ' clf for the system , i.e. , a clf only when the system operates in a certain region of the state space .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we introduce the amb model and motivate our stabilization problem . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we prove a lemma that constructs a stabilizing controller of arbitrarily small amplitude and a clf for a three - dimensional chain of integrators . in section [ sec4 ] , we use our lemma to construct a clf and corresponding stabilizing feedback for the amb model .",
    "we provide a numerical example in section [ sec5 ] , and we close in section [ sec6 ] with a summary of our work .",
    "the original nonlinear electromechanical model of the one degree - of - freedom amb system shown in figure 1 below can be subdivided into the mechanical subsystem dynamics , the magnetic force equation , and the electrical subsystem dynamics .",
    "the mechanical subsystem is governed by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the rotor mass , @xmath2 represents the position of the rotor center , @xmath3 is the magnetic flux in the @xmath4th electromagnet , @xmath5 denotes the force produced by the @xmath4th electromagnet , given by @xcite @xmath6 @xmath7 is the permeability of air , and @xmath8 is the cross - sectional area of the electromagnet .",
    "the electrical subsystem is governed by the equations @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the number of coil turns in the electromagnet , @xmath11 is the resistance of the @xmath4th electromagnet coil , @xmath12 is the input control voltage of the @xmath4th electromagnet , @xmath13 is the current in the @xmath4th electromagnet which is related to the flux according to @xcite @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the nominal air gap .    in this paper , we use the new form proposed in @xcite for the amb  dynamics in the switching mode of operation .",
    "we only outline the model derivation here , and refer the reader to @xcite for the details and justification .",
    "consider that the flux is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the constant _ bias _ flux and @xmath18 is the _ control _ flux .",
    "generalized _ control flux be defined as @xmath19 and consider the voltage switching strategy @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ generalized _ control voltage .",
    "based on ( [ flux])-([switch ] ) , the amb  model ( [ mech])-([elec ] ) has the equivalent form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and the coil resistance was neglected for simplicity .",
    "now , consider that the input voltages to the original amb model are amplitude limited , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the known limit .",
    "defining the states @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 and the change of input @xmath30 , the above model becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with the input constraint @xmath34 .",
    "our goal in this work is to design a feedback control law @xmath35 , satisfying the above saturation constraint , such that @xmath36 is gas where @xmath37 .",
    "the gas property means there is a continuously differentiable ( @xmath38 ) function @xmath39 that is radially unbounded and zero only at the origin , and for which the derivative @xmath40 along all trajectories of the system in closed - loop with the controller @xmath35 is negative definite .",
    "a function @xmath41 satisfying these requirements for some feedback @xmath35 is called a clf for ( [ xdot amb ] ) @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion on the relation between the global asymptotic stability of @xmath42 and the stability of the original amb states .",
    "in the following lemma , we use a forwarding - like approach based on @xcite to construct a clf and corresponding stabilizing state feedback of arbitrarily small amplitude for a three - dimensional chain of integrators .",
    "we let @xmath43 denote the standard saturation projecting @xmath44 onto @xmath45 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath46 when @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise . however , see remark 1 below for a version of our construction where the hard saturation @xmath43 is replaced by a smoother function .",
    "[ mainlemma ] consider the chain of integrators @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the control input .",
    "let @xmath51 be given and @xmath52 define the change of variables @xmath53 and the functions @xmath54 g(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3 } ) & = & \\frac{\\delta } { c_{1}}\\sigma ( z_{1})+4\\left ( 1+u(z_{2},z_{3})\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left ( z_{3}+\\sigma ( z_{2})\\right ) -\\frac{\\delta } { 2}\\left ( z_{2}+z_{3}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the function @xmath55 is a clf for ( [ chain ] ) since its derivative along the trajectories of system ( [ chain ] ) in closed loop with the control @xmath56 is negative definite . in particular , the bounded control ( [ ubar ] ) renders ( [ chain ] ) gas to the origin .",
    "the saturation function @xmath43 from lemma [ mainlemma ] is lipschitz continuous but not continuously differentiable .",
    "we chose this hard saturation for simplicity of analysis .",
    "however , one can prove a similar result with smoother saturation functions .",
    "for example , if one instead chooses the @xmath57 function @xmath58 \\\\ \\mathrm{sign}(s)\\left [ 1+\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\tan ^{-1}\\left ( \\pi \\left ( \\left| s\\right| -1\\right ) \\right ) \\right ] \\quad \\mathrm{if}\\;|s|>1 , \\end{array } \\right .   \\label{sigma}\\]]then the only change in the statement of lemma [ mainlemma ] is to the right - hand side of the inequality ( [ delta cond ] ) .",
    "the proof for this saturation is similar to the proof we give below .",
    "condition ( [ delta cond ] ) in lemma [ mainlemma ] allows cases where @xmath59 is arbitrarily large and @xmath60 is as small as desired , as well as cases where @xmath61 is arbitrarily small , including the case where @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we use ( [ z ] ) and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the new control input , to transform ( [ chain ] ) into @xmath65    we first perform a lyapunov - type analysis on the @xmath66-subsystem using the function @xmath67 where @xmath68 was defined in ( [ uu ] ) . by separately considering the cases where @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ", one can easily verify that ( [ v1 ] ) is positive - definite and radially unbounded for @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath70 , then @xmath72 on the other hand , if @xmath69 , then @xmath73 , so @xmath74    the time derivative of ( [ v1 ] ) along the trajectories of the @xmath66-subsystem is given by @xmath75 \\alpha . \\label{v1dot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 give @xmath79 ( [ v1dot1 ] ) becomes @xmath80 \\alpha .",
    "\\label{v1dot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now distinguish between two cases :    1 .",

    "then @xmath85 sign@xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 + since @xmath83 , applying ( [ integral ] ) to ( [ v1dot2 ] ) again yields ( [ v1dot3 ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ v1dot3 ] ) holds for all @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we perform a lyapunov - type analysis on the whole system ( [ zdot ] ) using the positive definite radially unbounded function @xmath41 from ( [ clf ] ) .",
    "since @xmath90 , where @xmath91 was defined in ( [ v1 ] ) , it follows from ( [ v1dot3 ] ) that the time derivative of ( [ clf ] ) along the system trajectories satisfies @xmath92 \\alpha . \\label{vdot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we again distinguish between two cases :    1 .",
    "then @xmath93 , so ( [ vdot1 ] ) gives @xmath94 \\alpha .",
    "\\label{vdot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 2 .",
    ". then ( [ integral ] ) holds and since @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we again get ( [ vdot2 ] ) .",
    "thus , ( [ vdot2 ] ) holds for all @xmath89 .",
    "using @xmath97 and ( [ g ] ) , ( [ vdot2 ] ) becomes @xmath98 by separately considering the cases @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 , i.e. , @xmath40 is negative definite .",
    "one can easily verify that the origin is a unique equilibrium point of ( [ zdot ] ) in closed loop with @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath103 is gas @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ z ] ) that @xmath104 is gas , and that ( [ clf ] ) is a clf for ( [ chain ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to state our main result on the global asymptotic stabilization of ( [ xdot amb ] ) with control saturation .",
    "[ mainthm ] the control law @xmath105 where @xmath106 was defined in ( [ ubar ] ) and @xmath107 in closed loop with ( [ xdot amb ] ) ensures @xmath36 is gas , and has arbitrarily small amplitude .",
    "moreover , with the choice ( [ clf ] ) , the function @xmath108 is a clf for ( [ xdot amb ] ) .",
    "we use the change of variable ( [ x3 ] ) and the change of input ( [ u ] ) to transform ( [ xdot amb ] ) into the chain of integrators @xmath109 after setting @xmath110 to ( [ ubar ] ) with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , we can invoke lemma [ mainlemma ] to conclude @xmath114 is gas for ( [ chain int ] ) .",
    "it then follows from ( [ x3 ] ) that @xmath36 is gas for the system ( [ xdot amb ] ) in closed loop with the feedback ( [ u])-([x3 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath115 @xmath116 is a clf for the amb dynamics follows from the proof of lemma [ mainlemma ] .",
    "notice that the control law ( [ u ] ) has arbitrarily small amplitude since along the closed - loop trajectories , @xmath117 thus , one can choose @xmath118 such that @xmath119 to ensure the amb voltages satisfy the voltage constraint @xmath120 , @xmath25 @xmath121 . from ( [ c12 cond ] ) , one can also see that the control gains can be adjusted to accommodate sufficiently small bias levels due to the direct dependency of @xmath122 on the bias flux @xmath123 ( i.e. , a low - bias control ) .",
    "however , one can not set @xmath124 since the control may have a singularity .",
    "it is worth comparing our construction from theorem [ mainthm ] with the amb controller from section vi of @xcite , where the stabilizing controller took the form of nested hard saturations . in @xcite , the proof that the control stabilizes the amb system is based on the method of @xcite , which uses the hardness of the saturation @xmath43 in an essential way .",
    "the argument shows that the nested hard saturations cause the amb dynamics ( [ xdot amb ] ) to assume a simplified form after sufficiently large time .",
    "then one shows that this new system of ` asymptotic ' equations is gas using a lyapunov - like analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the lyapunov function used in the analysis of @xcite is not a clf for the amb  dynamics ( [ xdot amb ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , our construction is not restricted to the standard hard saturation as explained in remark 1 , and thus can lead to smoother stabilizing controllers .",
    "also , the lyapunov function from theorem [ mainthm ] is negative definite along the closed - loop amb trajectories with the feedback ( [ u ] ) _ for all time _ , and thus is a clf for the amb dynamics ( [ xdot amb ] ) .    knowing a global clf @xmath125 and corresponding globally stabilizing feedback @xmath35 for the amb dynamics",
    ", we can construct a feedback @xmath126 that renders the system input - to - state stable ( iss ) to exogenous disturbances @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath125 and @xmath35 from our theorem , and letting @xmath127 denote the open - loop amb dynamics , it follows from [ 9 , theorem 1 ] that the system @xmath128 @xmath129 is iss relative to relative to any measurable locally essentially bounded ( e.g. , locally bounded piecewise continuous ) , exogenous disturbance @xmath130 under the combined feedback @xmath131 .",
    "this is because the term @xmath132 in the feedback is the lie derivative of @xmath41 in the direction of the constant vector field @xmath133 that multiplies the input in the amb dynamics .",
    "note that in this case the feedback @xmath126 is not necessarily saturated .",
    "this is because if @xmath126 were any saturated feedback rendering @xmath134 iss , and if @xmath135 were a positive global bound on @xmath126 , then the third component of the dynamic @xmath136 would have unbounded trajectories when the disturbance is for example @xmath137 , thus violating the iss requirement .",
    "hence , there is no globally saturated feedback that renders the amb dynamics iss to exogenous disturbances .",
    "moreover , the clf allows us to construct a feedback @xmath138 rendering the noisy system @xmath128 @xmath139 iss with respect to the disturbance @xmath140 for small measurement errors @xmath141 in the controller @xcite . in the context of ambs ,",
    "@xmath140 could represent rotor unbalance or vibrations transmitted through the bearing  foundation while @xmath142 could represent inaccuracies in sensing displacement , velocity , and/or flux .",
    "the proposed control law from theorem [ mainthm ] above was simulated on the same high - fidelity model of the one degree - of - freedom magnetic levitation system @xcite used in @xcite .",
    "the model includes flux leakage , magnetic material saturation , coil resistance , voltage saturation , and flexible modes , and thus is a fairly accurate representation of the actual system test rig @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete description of the system model .    as in @xcite ,",
    "the system was simulated with @xmath143 @xmath110wb , @xmath144 v , and initial conditions set to @xmath145 mrad , @xmath146 mrad / s , @xmath147 @xmath110wb , and @xmath148 @xmath110wb .",
    "the above flux values are for the _ total _ flux in the magnetic levitation system , i.e. , including gap flux and flux leakage .",
    "the control parameters @xmath149 were selected according to ( [ c12 cond ] ) and ( [ delta cond ] ) to yield the fastest convergence possible for the state @xmath150 .",
    "this resulted in the following parameter values : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "the simulation results for the system states @xmath150 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 ( @xmath25 ) , and for the control voltages @xmath156 ( @xmath25 ) are shown in figure 2 below , where @xmath155 denotes the gap flux . when compared with the simulation of the controller from section vi of @xcite ( see figure 8 of @xcite ) , the our control yields similar closed - loop performance although it can be tuned to produce a faster response as seen from figure 2 .",
    "we constructed a stabilizing controller and control - lyapunov function for low - bias active magnetic bearings ( ambs ) with voltage saturation .",
