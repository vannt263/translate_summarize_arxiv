    "galaxy evolution is strongly influenced by interactions and mergers .",
    "dramatic structural changes often result from such events . interactions and mergers",
    "occur more frequently at higher redshifts , and were even more important in the early universe than today .",
    "tidal tails may be ejected @xmath6 kpc during strong interactions , with more than half of the neutral gas in each galaxy ending up in the tail @xcite .",
    "the tails often are blue @xcite ; occasionally  emission and young stars ( few 100 myr ) are detected , indicative of active star - formation @xcite .",
    "models predict that gas condensations in tidal tails will self - gravitate into new  tidal dwarf galaxies \" ( tdgs ) @xcite ; such predictions are confirmed by observation @xcite .",
    "recent work on tidal tails @xcite has established that young star clusters and associations ( 10 - 500 myr ) can form in tidal tails .    in this letter , we present analysis of strong uv emission associated with tidal tails in four major galaxy interactions .",
    "hibbard et al .",
    "( this volume ) also report the galex detection of _ in situ _ star formation within the tidal tails of the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ) .",
    "we present galex uv imagery ( figure 1 , a - d ) , plus archival visible - band and hi observations ( figure 1 , e - h ) , for ngc  7769/71 , ngc  5713/19 , arp  295 , and the ngc  520 ( arp  157 ) system .",
    "they represent a range of merger stages , from very early ( ngc 7769/71 and ngc 5713/19 ) , through early ( arp 295 ) , to nearly merged ( ngc  520 ) .",
    "the ngc  7769/71 pair ( @xmath7=56mpc ) dominate a loose galaxy group embedded in a common hi envelope @xcite .",
    "ngc  7771 is part of a triplet of galaxies including ngc  7770 and ngc 7771a .",
    "a ring of higher column density encircles the ngc  7771 triplet , and lower column density h  i extends in a tail ( @xmath8 kpc to the south ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the galaxies have passed perigalacticon once in a prograde ( ngc  7771 ) - retrograde(ngc  7769 ) interaction , in which a significant tidal tail was ejected from ngc7771 , but very little matter was removed from ngc  7769 .",

    "hi column densities are quite high in the tails , @xmath9 cm@xmath2 .",
    "we focus on ngc  5719 s tidal tail , which extends @xmath11 40 kpc .",
    "the galaxies in the arp  295 pair ( d@xmath1269mpc ) are the largest spirals in a loose group of galaxies .",
    "they appear connected by a dramatic optical and h  i bridge .",
    "a luminous tail extends @xmath11 50 kpc to the southwest of arp  295a , and a plume extends @xmath0 35 kpc to east of arp 295b @xcite .",
    "the system apparently resulted from a prograde ( arp  295a ) - retrograde ( arp  295b ) encounter , when an extensive tail was ejected from arp295a ( it wraps around to _ appear _ as the bridge between the galaxies before extending off to the sw ) and the gas - rich plume east of arp  295b was removed but remained near the parent galaxy .",
    "the ngc  520 system ( d@xmath1223mpc ) is more evolved , with the progenitor disks almost merged ; k - band peaks indicate two nuclei separated by only @xmath05  kpc @xcite .",
    "an optical and hi tidal tail extends @xmath025kpc to the south from the nuclei , then abruptly bends into a faint red plume and h  i arm extending east and then north .",
    "these structures are embedded in a disk - like hi distribution @xcite , which extends northward to the dwarf galaxy ugc  957 ( @xmath13 50kpc separation ) and then continues around to the west and south .",
    "the ngc  520 system probably resulted from a prograde - retrograde ( or polar ) interaction between two large disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that ugc  957 may be a tidal dwarf galaxy formed in the interaction .",
    "galex observed each system for a single orbit in both fuv ( 1530 ) and nuv ( 2310 ) bands .",
    "routine data processing and calibration was as described in @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the galex images compared to visible and @xmath1421 cm h  i imagery .",
    "uv emission is seen to be associated with all of the interacting galaxies and their tidal tails , extending large distances ( 10 - 100kpc ) beyond the optical extent .",
    "the images were adaptively smoothed , and morphologically distinct regions were selected for photometry ( fuv images were used to define apertures at all wavelengths ( figure 1 , top ) .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using custom idl routines ; sky was determined as the mean of 8@xmath1512 boxes around the target .",
    "background - subtracted ab magnitudes , photometric errors , and fuv@xmath15nuv colors were then determined ( table 1 ) from the original unsmoothed data",
    ".    the ngc  7769/71 galex image ( 1663 sec , fig 1a ) shows strong uv features associated with the both principal galaxies , their satellites , and with a peak in the sw hi tail of ngc  7771 at ngc  7771b .",
    "a faint uv halo extends w of ngc 7771 towards ngc 7770 and ngc 7771a , in agreement with the extent of the hi .",
    "ngc  7771b has the most extreme fuv@xmath15nuv value in our galaxy sample .",
    "the disks of ngc  5719 and ngc  5713 ( not shown ) are easily detected in the short galex observation ( 844 sec , fig 1b ) .",
    "uv emission extends well beyond ngc  5719 s optical disk , continuing nearly the entire length of ngc  5719 s hi tidal tail ( @xmath11 40 kpc from the nucleus ) .",
    "the tail fuv emission consists of very blue clumps at the locations of hi peaks , as well as a more diffuse component .",
    "very faint bridge uv emission is also detected coincident with the h  i nw of ngc  5719 , extending towards ngc  5713 .",

    "uv emission is detected from arp  295a s tidal tail and from the bridge , however the tidal tail does not extend as far to the sw in the uv as it does at visible wavelengths , and the uv bridge fades in the middle .",
    "the plume east of arp  295b is conspicuous in the uv , with clump  1 ( embedded in the plume ) the bluest uv location in the arp  295 system .",
    "the uv observations of ngc  520 ( 1730 sec , figure 1d ) show that the central region appears similar at uv and visible wavelengths @xcite ) , with fuv emission detected from the remnant galaxy bodies .",
    "the inner regions of two clumpy tidal tails are clearly visible in the uv images , extending se and nw .",
    "ugc  957 , the likely tdg , shows up very clearly in the fuv image , and has the bluest uv colors in the system .",
    "the red plume extending e and n to ugc  957 is not detected in the uv .",
    "hi maps of each interacting system were obtained using the nrao vla .",
    "details of the array configuration , correlator setup , imaging parameters , and subsequent deconvolution are in the original papers ( ngc  7769/71 : @xcite , ngc  5713/19 : @xcite , arp 295 and ngc  520 : @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the synthesized beam measured @xmath16 with integrations sufficient to accurately map hi column densities @xmath13 few @xmath17cm@xmath2 .",
    "the hi distribution is seen to be closely matched to the fuv emission , ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the h  i and the fuv emission generally peak at the same locations in the tidal tails ( within the accuracy of the h  i resolution ) .",
    "the hi surface density generally exceeds @xmath0 2 m@xmath18 where fuv emission",
    "is detected ( table 1 ) . in locations where the h  i is below this level ,",
    "fuv emission is usually not detected .",
    "this suggests that _ current _ star formation is directly related to the cold gas density , and that a threshold density must be reached before star formation can begins . assuming that co is coincident with h  i suggests that the observed ( h  i ) density of @xmath0 2 m@xmath1 pc@xmath2 is a lower limit to the star - formation threshold density in tidal tails .",
    "_ higher resolution h  i and spatially resolved co images would be very helpful in exploring this possibility .",
    "_      photometry at visible wavelengths was performed for the selected uv - bright regions ( sky was determined from multiple 15  @xmath19 15  squares , fluxes of individual pixels were summed using iraf ) . for ngc  7771 we used optical images in the sdss @xmath20 bands from the int wide angle survey @xcite , and for ngc  5719 we used sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath21 images .",
    "optical images for arp  295 ( @xmath22 ) and ngc  520 ( @xmath23 ) were obtained by hibbard & van gorkom ( 1996 ) .",
    "after removal of field stars we computed apparent magnitudes with associated errors , including calibration and background - subtraction uncertainties ( but excluding photon - noise ) . in cases where",
    "no optical emission was detected we determined 1-@xmath24 upper limits .",
    "there are many locations where uv emission and hi are detected , but no optical emission is evident ( figure  1 ) : for example ngc  7771b , the extended se tidal tail of ngc  5713 , or the plume east of arp  295b . in these regions ,",
    "the h  i column density is always @xmath11 2 m@xmath1 pc@xmath2 . in a few regions ,",
    "optical light is detected with no corresponding uv or hi , for example at the end of the sw tail or in the center of the bridge in arp  295 , or from the red plume extending north from ngc  520 . in these regions ,",
    "the colors are indicative of old stars , presumably pulled from the progenitor galaxies during the interaction .",
    "luminosity - weighted average ages and extinction for the stellar populations in uv - bright regions were estimated by comparing observed fuv@xmath15nuv and nuv@xmath15optical colors with reddened synthetic predictions ( bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , computed as described by bianchi et al .",
    "the observed colors were corrected for foreground extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) prior to model fitting .",
    "the inclusion of the uv@xmath15optical color was vital , as it discounted the possibility that any of the observed fuv@xmath15nuv colors were due to hot evolved main - sequence stars with ages @xmath25 yr . in table",
    "1 we give ages derived under the assumption of ( single ) instantaneous burst star formation .",
    "these values represent lower limits to the actual ages ( the integrated color of a mixed - age population is made bluer by the most recent burst , unless the mass in stars formed is insignificant relative to the pre - existing total ) .",
    "we emphasize that a good match to the synthetic colors of a recent burst does not preclude star formation at earlier times , except in the limit where the latest burst fully accounts for the bolometric luminosity of a source .",
    "the arp  295 plume was the only source having colors better fit by the alternate case of continuous star formation . in this scenario ,",
    "synthetic colors remain blue indefinitely .",
    "it is plausible that the plume has hosted recurrent bursts ( of which clump 1 and 2 are the most recent ) occuring at a rate that makes star - formation in the region appear psuedo - continuous . for all uv - selected regions we also estimated stellar masses ( table 1 ) based on the extinction - corrected fuv magnitude and the best matching synthetic model .",
    "the ( fuv@xmath15nuv , nuv@xmath15optical ) ages for uv - selected regions cover a substantial range .",
    "ngc  7771 and ngc  5719 , in the earliest interactions , have uv - bright regions ranging from @xmath53 myr ( ngc7771b , ngc  5719 clumps ) to @xmath0400myr .",
    "arp  295 exhibits very recent star formation only in the eastern plume ( @xmath5 8myr ) , while the rest of the system appears to have ages between 80myr and 400myr .",
    "the ngc  520 system ( oldest interaction ) shows no evidence for current star formation , and the youngest regions are @xmath0300myr ( in ugc  957 ) .",
    "since the uv - bright regions identified by galex are considerably younger than the dynamical ages of the tails ( @xmath11 500myr based on morphology and models , @xcite ) , the bursts of star formation must occur during the evolution of the tidal tails .",
    "_ it would be invaluable to have reliable determinations of dynamic histories of all of these systems , e.g. through targeted models .",
    "_      the uv observations allow us to begin tracing the star formation history of the tidal tails . in ngc  7771 ,",
    "the youngest stars are at the end of the h  i tail . in ngc  5719 , the youngest clump is furthest from the galaxy body , the diffuse se tail is considerably younger than the nw tail ( which is younger than the galaxy disk ) . in arp  295 ,",
    "the clumps in the plume are the youngest , followed by the plume itself ; the long tail that has been ejected from arp  295a is younger at its sw extreme and older in the inner regions ( the bridge ) . in ngc  520 , the youngest stars are in ugc  957 .",
    "we also find ( section 2.3 ) , that the brightest uv emission coincides with hi peaks ; examination of table  1 shows that these locations are also the bluest ( youngest ) .",
    "star formation is apparently still occurring in the possible tdgs , but not in the knots closer to the parent galaxy .",
    "this could be because the critical density takes longer to develop as the distance from the parent galaxy increases , or because star formation has been inhibited at the tail / galaxy interface .",
    "one question of great interest is whether or not the star - forming clumps in the tidal tails are destined to remain as independent entities  that is , as tdgs . of the compact uv - bright regions",
    "well - separated from the primary interacting galaxies , several of our sources have hi mass comparable to confirmed tdgs .",
    "duc & mirabel ( 1998 ) indicate tdgs have hi mass ranging from 10@xmath26 to 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 . within our own sample tdg ugc  957 ( near ngc  520 )",
    "has 10@xmath29 m@xmath28 of hi , and the tdg s in ngc  4038/39 have 10@xmath30 m@xmath28 of hi @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "ngc7771b , arp 295 clump 1 , and arp 295 clump 2 have 10@xmath31 , 10@xmath32 , and 10@xmath33 m@xmath28 , respectively , of hi coincident with uv emission , making them plausible tdg candidates .",
    "high - resolution @xmath34 cm observations able to gauge the velocity dispersion within these ( and even slightly lower mass condensations like n5719 clumps 1 and 2 , 10@xmath35 m@xmath28 of hi ) are needed to determine conclusively if they are self - gravitating .",
    "regardless , our early galex observations demonstrate the effectiveness of vacuum uv imaging as a means of identifying tdg candidates , particularly at the lower limit of the mass function .",
