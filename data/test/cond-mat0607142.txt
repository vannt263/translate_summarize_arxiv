    "a very popular and highly successful model for collisions of two nuclei at intermediate energies ( 50 mev to 100 mev per nucleon ) is the following .",
    "because of many collisions between nucleons , a statistical equilibrium is reached . the temperature rises .",
    "the system expands from normal density and composites are formed on the way to disassembly . as the system reaches between 3 to 6 times the normal volume",
    ", the interactions between the composites become unimportant ( except for the long range coulomb interaction ) and one can do a statistical equilibrium calculation to obtain the yields of the composites at a volume which is called the freeze - out volume .",
    "although the model is simple , actual realistic calculations based on the model are much harder .",
    "the nucleus is a finite system .",
    "it has two kinds of particles , neutrons and protons ( generically termed nucleons ) .",
    "protons carry charges and prevent large nuclei from being formed . for realistic treatment , the idea of a strict freeze - out volume has to be modified .",
    "here we consider the same physics but with the following simplifications : only one kind of particle is considered and the coulomb interaction is neglected meaning arbitrarily large `` nuclei '' can be formed .",
    "the energy scale is mev ( million electron volt ) and the length scale is fm ( @xmath7 cm ) so the salient features of nuclear physics are retained .",
    "the binding energy and the volume of a composite is proportional to the number of particles ( nucleons ) in the composite and have a surface tension proportional to the surface area .",
    "we show , with rather little effort , that the model leads to a first order phase transition as either the density the temperature or both are varied .",
    "the system has a region of liquid - gas coexistence where , as for the maxwell construction of a van der waals gas , pressure remains constant when the density increases along the isotherm . in this region",
    "the chemical potential remains unchanged .",
    "as one traverses the path from the liquid phase to the gas phase the clausius - clapeyron relationship is obeyed . for large systems ,",
    "a scaling law for composites emerges : if we know the yields of composites for one large system , we know these for another large system .",
    "a more realistic version of this model has been used for bevalac physics ( @xmath8250 mev per nucleon beam energy in the lab ) by many authors more than twenty - five years ago .",
    "it is not possible to quote all the references but a review article @xcite has a more complete list .",
    "the possibility of a phase transition was not considered as the collision energies were too high for the liquid phase and only very light composites could be produced .",
    "phase transitions in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies became a topic of considerable interest starting from the mid - eighties and continues to be a central issue .",
    "there are many approaches and a large literature too numerous to list .",
    "we will refer here to only a few which closely follow the underlying physics considered here .",
    "the same model as used here was adopted in @xcite for finite nuclei . by extrapolation",
    "it was shown that the model leads to a first order phase transition .",
    "a brief application of this model is given in section vii .",
    "a grand canonical model was used in @xcite which demonstrated a first order phase transition .",
    "the approach was quite different from what is used here .",
    "we use simpler , more traditional and numerical methods .",
    "our results are similar but sufficiently different to warrant a full description . a discussion of clausius - clapeyron relations and a scaling law highlight some interesting physics .    the celebrated statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) of copenhagen @xcite , the microcanonical models of gross and randrup , koonin @xcite use the same underlying physics as in this work",
    "but the emphasis was on trying to be as close to to the actual nuclear situation as one can and thus the phase transition aspects are largely hidden .",
    "if we have @xmath9 particles of type @xmath10 , @xmath11 particles of type @xmath12 , @xmath13 particles of type @xmath14 etc . all enclosed in a volume @xmath15 and interactions between particles can be neglected , the grand partition function for this case can be written as @xmath16 here the @xmath17 is the chemical potential and @xmath18 the canonical partition function of one particle of type @xmath19 .",
    "the average number of particles of type @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 : @xmath21 it is possible that one of the species can be built from two other species . in reverse",
    ", a heavier species can also break up into two lighter species .",
    "if @xmath22 number of particles of type @xmath10 can combine with @xmath23 number of particles of type @xmath12 to produce @xmath24 number of particles of type @xmath14 , then chemical equilibrium implies @xcite that the chemical potentials of @xmath25 and @xmath14 are related by @xmath26 .",
    "in our model we have @xmath4 nucleons in a volume @xmath15 but these nucleons can be singles or form bound dimers , trimers etc .",
    "chemical equilibrium implies that a composite with @xmath0 bound nucleons has a chemical potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the chemical potential of the monomer ( nucleon ) .",
    "thus our ensemble has monomers , dimers , trimers etc .",
    "upto some species with @xmath29 bound nucleons where ideally @xmath30 . for practical calculations",
    ", we use a finite value of @xmath29 .",
    "most of the results shown here use @xmath31 although we have also done calculations with much larger values .",
    "choosing @xmath31 does not mean that the total number of nucleons is 2000 .",
    "the total number of nucleons can be infinite but the largest species allowed in the calculation ( is somewhat artificially ) limited to 2000",
    ". the total number of nucleons will be denoted by @xmath4 where @xmath4 is very large .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 plays an essential role , setting @xmath29 too low ( for example 200 as shown in section vii ) makes then liquid - gas transition disappear .",
    "an assembly with @xmath32200 particles or less does not display the typical behaviour of liquid - gas co - existence .",
    "we now look into @xmath18 , the partition function of one composite of @xmath19 nucleons.this factors into two parts , a traditional translation energy part and an intrinsic part : @xmath33 where @xmath34 the intrinsic part @xmath35 of course contains the key to phase transition .",
    "if we regard each composite to exist only in a ground state with energy @xmath36 , then @xmath37 .",
    "we use @xmath38 where nuclear physics sets @xmath2=16 mev and @xmath39 mev . this simple model",
    "itself will lead to the main results of this paper . because of the surface term , energy per particle drops as @xmath19 grows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath40 the free energy of the @xmath4 nucleons where @xmath4 is the total number of nucleons ; @xmath41 be the energy and @xmath42 , the entropy : @xmath43 . at finite temperature @xmath40 will go to its minimum value .",
    "the key issue is how the system of @xmath4 nucleons breaks up into clusters of different sizes as the temperature changes . at low temperature @xmath41 and",
    "hence @xmath40 minimises by forming very large clusters ( liquid ) .",
    "but as the temperature increases @xmath42 will increase by forming larger number of clusters thus breaking up the big clusters .",
    "gaseous phase will appear .",
    "how exactly this will happen requires calculation and we find that the system goes through a first order liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "we used here a slightly more sophisticated model for @xmath35 .",
    "this does not make the calculation any harder ( or alter the qualitative features ) but makes it more realistic .",
    "we make the surface tension temperature dependent in conformity with usual parametrisation @xcite ; @xmath44^{5/2}$ ]    here @xmath4518 mev and @xmath46=18 mev . at @xmath47 surface tension vanishes and we have a fluid only . for us",
    "this is unimportant as our focus will be the temperature range 3 to 8 mev .    in computing the partition function @xmath35",
    "we include not just the ground state but also excited states of the composite in an approximate fashion .",
    "we should compute @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 is the density of excited states of this particular composite . instead of trying to calculate @xmath35 by performing the sum and integral",
    "we use a well - known trick . utilise the relation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and now use the fermi - gas formula for the nucleus with @xmath19 nucleons ( approximately correct and widely used at intermediate temperature ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 .",
    "this is similar to electron gas at finite temperature ( excitation energy goes like @xmath54 ) except that in nuclear physics the value of @xmath55 is @xmath3216 mev .",
    "the intrinsic entropy of the nucleus at this temperature is @xmath56 .",
    "the expression for @xmath35 is now complete and easily tractable .",
    "let us now summarise the relevant equations . for @xmath57 ( the nucleon which has no excited states ) @xmath58 and for @xmath59 @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath61 is the average number of composites with @xmath0 nucleons . in the rest of the paper , for brevity",
    ", we will omit the qualifier `` average '' .",
    "it is always implied .",
    "a useful quantity is the multiplicity defined as @xmath62 the number of nucleons bound in a composite with @xmath0 nucleons is @xmath63 and obviously @xmath64 .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath65 quantities like @xmath66 are all extensive variables .",
    "these equations can all be cast in terms of intensive variables like @xmath67 etc so that we can assume both @xmath4 and @xmath15 approach very large values and fluctuations in the number of particles can be ignored .",
    "thus for a given temperature and density we solve for @xmath28 using @xmath68)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum rule @xmath69 changes to @xmath70 .    from what we have described so far",
    "it would appear that @xmath15 in eqs.(3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) is the freeze - out volume @xmath15 , the volume to which the system has expanded .",
    "actually if the freeze - out volume is @xmath15 then in these equations we use @xmath71 which is close to @xmath15 but less .",
    "the reason for this is the following . to a good approximation",
    "a composite of @xmath0 nucleons is an incompressible sphere with volume @xmath72 where the value of @xmath73 is @xmath32 0.16 @xmath74 .",
    "the volume available for translational motion ( eq.(3 ) ) is then @xmath75 where we approximate @xmath76 the normal volume of a nucleus with @xmath4 nucleons .",
    "similar corrections are implicit in van der waals equation of state .",
    "this is meant to take care of hard sphere interactions between different particles .",
    "this answer is approximate .",
    "the correct answer is multiplicity dependent .",
    "the approximation of non - interacting composites in a volume gets to be worse as the volume decreases .",
    "we restrict our calculation to volumes @xmath15 greater than @xmath77 .",
    "this is how the calculations reported in the next section proceed .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath78 from which @xmath79 is deduced .",
    "this value of @xmath80 is used in eq.(8 ) to calculate @xmath28 and all other quantities .",
    "we plot results as function of @xmath81 .",
    "if we plotted them as function of @xmath82 the plot would shift to the right .",
    "calculations in @xcite are continued beyond the limit @xmath83 .",
    "they find one can identify a critical point at @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . at very high pressure the model should break down : @xmath87 must change at such high pressure although nuclear physics says that nuclei being highly incompressible moderate pressures should leave the internal partition functions relatively unchanged . another way of saying this is that interaction between composites should be taken into account for @xmath88 .",
    "for a given temperature @xmath89 and @xmath6 we solve for @xmath28 and then pressure .",
    "this is plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "for each isotherm shown the pressure rises rapidly at first with @xmath6 but then flattens out .",
    "the flattening depends upon the value of @xmath29 . for low @xmath29 ( shown in section vii ) there will not be any flattening .",
    "the value of @xmath29 used in fig .",
    "1 is 2000 .",
    "there is still a very slight rise in @xmath90 ( not discernible in the figure ) .",
    "the figure empirically allows us to designate two regions : a purely gas phase where the pressure rises with density and a liquid - gas co - existence phase where the volume changes but the pressure is nearly stationary .",
    "one way of seeing this is that @xmath91 . as @xmath92 decreases so does @xmath93 so as to compensate in the co - existence region .",
    "1 also shows that in the gas phase , the chemical potential rises rapidly with density but then flattens out in the co - existence phase .",
    "a discussion about @xmath28 dependence in the co - existence region is in order here .",
    "for @xmath29 large @xmath6 is much more sensitive to @xmath28 than pressure ( @xmath6 has weighting of @xmath94 , eq.(8 ) whereas @xmath90 has @xmath95 weighting ( eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) ) . for very large @xmath29",
    "an infinitesimal change in @xmath28 will lead to a finite change in @xmath6 but only a very small change in @xmath90 . in the limit @xmath30",
    "we will reach ideal liquid gas phase transition : no change of @xmath28 in the coexistence region and no change of pressure .",
    "this is demonstrated in section vi .",
    "as an example , at fixed temperature 7 mev we show in fig .  2 the distribution of composites ( a ) in the pure gas region ( @xmath96 ) ) and ( b ) in the co - existence region ( @xmath97 ) . in the gas phase",
    "the sum rule @xmath98 is exhausted well before we reach 50 .",
    "there are no heavy composites . in the co - existence region",
    "there are light particles ( @xmath99 ) , then nothing for a long range of @xmath0 , and then there are heavy particles with @xmath0 between 1800 to @xmath31 ( the figure shows the population of @xmath0=1900 to @xmath31 ) .",
    "a safe functional definition for the gas phase is all composites between @xmath0=1 to @xmath100 and for the liquid phase all composites between @xmath101 to @xmath29 .",
    "thus both the liquid and the gas phases are quite complicated ; consisting of not one or two but many species although they are all made up of the same elemental nucleon .",
    "in the co - existence region the pressure is a rapidly increasing function of the temperature . in fig .  1 these are the flat regions shown for three temperatures ( dash - dot 6 mev , solid 7 mev and dash 7.5 mev ) .",
    "the clausius - clapeyron relation for liquid - gas phase transition provides an equation for the rate of change @xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 can be taken to be the change of entropy per unit mass and @xmath104 the corresponding change in volume as matter moves across phase transition .",
    "we can take these changes to be per nucleon .",
    "the following substitutions are made:@xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the latent heat ) and @xmath107 .",
    "the standard approximation now is @xmath108 and thus @xmath109 if we make the assumption that @xmath106 is nearly independent of temperature then the equation integrates out to give @xmath110 this does not work well in our case ( fig .",
    "3 ) : @xmath111 is not a linear function of @xmath112 . we can discard the assumption that @xmath106 is constant and instead use eq.(10 ) to get an idea of @xmath106 using values of @xmath113 and @xmath89 from fig .  1 .",
    "if this is done then at 6 mev temperature , the value of @xmath106 turns out to be 54 mev and at 7 mev temperature this reaches 70 mev . since the binding energy per particle for an infinite cluster is 16 mev , these values are clearly unacceptably high .",
    "let us ask what went wrong in going from eq.(9 ) to eq.(11 ) .",
    "the passage from eq.(10 ) to eq.(11 ) assumed that the latent heat is independent of temperature .",
    "we will show that this is approximately correct .",
    "however , the approximation @xmath114 is very inaccurate and depending upon the temperature , corrections due to @xmath115 can be significant . when all this is taken into account eq.(9 )",
    "is satisfied remarkably well .",
    "we elaborate first on the latent heat . for definiteness fix on the isothermal at 7 mev . from fig .",
    "1 we can determine the density at which the system enters the purely gaseous phase and its energy per particle from @xmath116 where @xmath117 . here",
    "@xmath118 consists of volume energy ( which is negative ) , surface energy and as well contributions from excited states .",
    "the expressions are given in section ii .",
    "the nucleons are passing from a liquid state ( from a composite with @xmath119 ) to the gaseous phase .",
    "the energy per particle in the liquid phase was taken from a composite of 1950 particles .",
    "reasonable variation around this number will only change the calculated value slightly . latent heat per particle calculated",
    "is 12.66 mev at temperature 6 mev and 11.55 mev at 7.5 mev .    by far",
    "the major error is in assuming that @xmath114 .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath120 and not @xmath121 where @xmath93 is the multiplicity and @xmath4 of course the total number of particles .",
    "thus @xmath122 .",
    "the factor @xmath123 when the system just turns into a pure gas phase is 0.276 at t=6.0 mev , 0.194 at 7.0 mev and 0.152 at 7.5 mev .",
    "writing @xmath22 for @xmath124 we find that eq.(10 ) should be rewritten as @xmath125}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath126 . as an example , at 7 mev @xmath127@xmath74 from fig .  1 and 0.0530@xmath74 estimated from formula ( 12 ) .",
    "at 6 mev the corresponding numbers are 0.0129@xmath74 and 0.0108@xmath74 respectively .",
    "we will now consider changes in the values of various quantities as we change from one large value of @xmath29 to another large value of @xmath29 . for definiteness we will concentrate on one isothermal , for example the @xmath89=7 mev case . in fig .",
    "1 we have two regions : pure gas phase and the co - existence phase .",
    "the pure gas phase is trivial .",
    "nothing changes as we go from one large @xmath29 to another ; @xmath29= 2000 is large enough in this case .",
    "it is easy to see why results become insensitive to changes in the value of @xmath29 . in the gas phase",
    "there is no population in high @xmath0 composites so it does not matter whether the summation stops at a given high value of @xmath29 or another high value of @xmath29 .",
    "the situation is more complicated but also more interesting in the co - existence region as we have population both at the lower end and the higher end of @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the values of @xmath28 and pressure calculated for @xmath29 in the range @xmath29= 2000 to 5000 .",
    "this is done at a fixed value of @xmath128 which is in the co - existence region .",
    "as shown in the figure , both curves are well fit by a parametrisation @xmath129 where @xmath130 , with values given in the caption .",
    "this means that within the accuracy with which this calculation was carried out , the values of @xmath28 and pressure in the infinite @xmath29 limit are -18.504 mev and 0.0294 mev @xmath74 respectively .",
    "a similar calculation as above was done for @xmath81=0.4 .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath25 and @xmath14 for @xmath28 were -18.504 mev , 0.33892 mev and 0.0003197 respectively .",
    "for pressure , the parameters were 0.0294 mev @xmath74 , 0.007633 mev @xmath74 and 0.0003906 respectively .",
    "note that the extrapolation demonstrates that that neither @xmath28 nor the pressure change in the co - existence region in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this firmly establishes the present model as a model of liquid - gas phase transition as was stated in section iii .",
    "lastly we want to estabish a scaling law . given the fractional occupation @xmath131 for a large value of @xmath29 , do we know the fractional occupation @xmath132 for another large value of @xmath29 ? based on the discussion , so far we expect that if one is in the purely gas phase @xmath133 and this is indeed the case .    in the co - existence phase a lowest order approximation",
    "is based on the following approximation .",
    "we expect the fractional occupation to match near the beginning ( @xmath0 small ) , near the end ( near @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) and in between there is almost no occupation .",
    "thus for @xmath0 small @xmath136 and near the high end @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "this is not very accurate but an accurate representation for low @xmath0 is given using the parametrisation : @xmath139.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an equation relating the large clusters can also be written down , but the functional form is quite complicated .",
    "the model can be solved when the number of particles @xmath4 is finite .",
    "extensive use of the canonical model has been made to fit experimental data @xcite so just an outline will be presented for completeness . among other applications ,",
    "the canonical model can be used to study finite particle number effects on phase transition characteristics .",
    "consider again @xmath4 identical particles in an enclosure @xmath15 and temperature @xmath89 .",
    "these @xmath4 nucleons will combine into monomers , dimers , trimers etc .",
    "the partition function of the system in the canonical ensemble can be written as @xmath140 here @xmath18 is the one particle partition function of a composite which has @xmath19 nucleons .",
    "we already encountered @xmath18 in section ii : @xmath33 with @xmath141 and @xmath35 given in detail .",
    "other forms for @xmath18 can be used in the method outlined here .",
    "the summation in eq.(14 ) is over all partitions which satisfy @xmath142 .",
    "the summation is non - trivial as the number of partitions which satisfy the sum is enormous .",
    "we can define a given allowed partition to be a channel .",
    "the probablity of the occurrence of a given channel @xmath143 is @xmath144 the average number of composites of @xmath19 nucleons is easily seen from the above equation to be @xmath145 since @xmath146 , one readily arrives at a recursion relation @xcite @xmath147 for one kind of particle , @xmath148 above is easily evaluated on a computer for @xmath4 as large as 3000 in matter of seconds .",
    "it is this recursion relation that makes the computation so easy in the model . of course , once one has the partition function all relevant thermodynamic quantities can be computed .",
    "for example , eq .",
    "( 7 ) still gives the expression for pressure although one could correct for the center of mass motion by reducing the multiplicity by 1 : @xmath149 .",
    "the chemical potential can be calculated from @xmath150 where the free energy is @xmath151 which is readily available from the calculation .    in fig .",
    "5 we show an example of the canonical model calculation .",
    "the temperature is 6 mev .",
    "the number of particles @xmath4 is 200 .",
    "the value of the largest allowed cluster @xmath29 is also 200 .",
    "this would be a typical nuclear physics case . in the same figure",
    "we also show the result of a grand canonical calculation with the same @xmath29 ( of course for the grand canonical @xmath4 is very large ) . at small density",
    "the results are the same but they become different at larger densities . in the canonical result",
    "there is a small region where @xmath152 is negative .",
    "this is a finite particle number effect since for large @xmath4 ( grand canonical result ) any negative compressibilty disappears .",
    "negative compressibility can lead to negative value for @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the grand canonical result shows that for @xmath29=200 typical liquid - gas co - existence is not found and there is no region where @xmath90 is constant when the density changes .",
    "results in section iii to section vi show that the model of excited matter breaking up into clusters with saturation properties leads to a first order phase transition .",
    "this has relevance to heavy ion collisions at intermediate energy but may have significance in other areas of physics as well .",
    "this model for first order phase transitions is extremely easy to implement .",
    "a very significant advantage of the model is that it can be solved not only in the thermodynamic limit ( large @xmath4 ) but also for a finite number of particles .",
    "thus one can study how observables change as one progresses from small to large systems .",
    "we like to end this discussion by noting that in spite of a very different approach that is adopted here to arrive at the key equations 5 , 7 and 8 , formally the pressure and density equations have the same structure as those encountered in the well - known mayer cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "these are @xmath154 and @xmath155 . here instead of the cluster integral @xmath156 we have @xmath157 .",
