    "the factorization approach ( fa ) based on the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) represents a reliable framework to study heavy quarkonium production and decay processes @xcite . according to the fa",
    "the inclusive production cross section for a quarkonium state @xmath6 in the process @xmath7 can be factorized as @xmath8 where the short - distance coefficients , @xmath9 , are associated with the production of a heavy quark pair in the color and angular momentum state @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this part of the cross section involves only momenta at least of the order of the heavy quark mass , @xmath11 , and can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "two distinct scales are introduced : the heavy quark - antiquark pair production process occurs at small distances , @xmath12 , and is factorized from the hadronization phase which takes place at large distances , @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the average velocity of heavy constituents in the quarkonium , with @xmath15 for charmonium and @xmath16 for bottomonium systems .",
    "the vacuum matrix elements of nrqcd operators , @xmath17 , describe the evolution of the quark - antiquark state @xmath10 $ ] into the final hadronic state @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these long distance matrix elements can not be calculated perturbatively , but their relative importance in powers of velocity @xmath14 can be estimated using the nrqcd velocity scaling rules @xcite .",
    "the important feature of this formalism is that the cross section of heavy quarkonium production can be organized as double expansion in powers of @xmath14 and @xmath18 . in higher order of @xmath14",
    "the fa implies that the quark - antiquark color octet intermediate states are allowed to contribute to heavy quarkonium production and decay processes .    unlike the color singlet long distance",
    "matrix elements , each connected with the subsequent non - relativistic wave function at the origin , the color octet long distance matrix elements are unknown and have to be extracted from the experimental data .",
    "the nrqcd factorization approach implies universality , i.e. the values of long distance matrix elements extracted from different experimental data sets must be the same .",
    "however , due to the presently rather large theoretical uncertainties @xcite and the unknown size of higher twist process contributions @xcite the existing experimental data do not allow yet to check the fa universality .",
    "the data on direct @xmath19 and @xmath20 production at large transverse momenta at the tevatron indicates that the color octet contribution is dominating .",
    "the @xmath21 state charmonia are produced through the gluon fragmentation into the @xmath22 octet state @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have shown that the contribution of color octet states to the charmonium and bottomonium production cross sections is very important at fixed target energies , @xmath23 gev , and reduces existing discrepancies between experimental data and predictions of the color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "however , some experimental data contradict the color octet model ( com ) predictions .",
    "in particular , theoretical predictions disagree with measurements of the polarization of @xmath19 and @xmath20 particles produced at fixed target energies @xcite and the com predicts a too low relative yield of the @xmath24 state compared to the @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one possible solution of these discrepancies was proposed by brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite suggesting that higher twist processes , when more than one parton from projectile or target participates in the reaction , might give a significant contribution to low @xmath26 production of @xmath19 and @xmath24 states .",
    "problems exist also in charmonium photoproduction at hera .",
    "the color octet contribution underestimates the inelastic @xmath19 photoproduction cross section at large values of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 in the laboratory frame ) @xcite .",
    "spin effects in heavy quarkonia production are expected to provide tests for the different mechanisms of heavy quarkonium production @xcite .",
    "predictions for the polarization of direct @xmath29 s produced at large @xmath26 at the tevatron are free from theoretical uncertainties connected with higher twist effects and corresponding measurements will provide an excellent possibility to test the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "the observation of opposite sign double spin asymmetries in the production of different charmonium states can also be used to discriminate the nrqcd fa from the color evaporation model ( cem ) which predicts the same spin asymmetries for all charmonium states @xcite .",
    "the cem also assumes a factorization between the production of a heavy quark pair and its hadronization phase .",
    "but unlike the nrqcd factorization approach the cem postulates that multiple soft gluon exchange in the hadronization phase destroys the initial polarization of the heavy quark pair and the heavy quarkonium is produced unpolarized @xcite .    at the same time",
    "it is not excluded that the mass of the charm quark is not large enough to apply the nrqcd factorization approach to charmonium production and decay processes . due to the rather large value of @xmath30 , about @xmath31 for the charmonium system",
    ", the fock states at higher order of @xmath30 may give the essential contribution and can then not be neglected .",
    "when fitting the values of the long distance parameters the heavy quark spin symmetries are used to reduce the number of independent parameters .",
    "these relations are valid up to @xmath30 and may get large corrections for charmonium production .",
    "in contrast , the nrqcd fa predictions for the bottomonium system are more reliable , since the expansion parameter @xmath30 is much smaller ( around @xmath32 ) , than for the charmonium system .",
    "higher twist processes are also expected to be suppressed as @xmath33 ( compare with @xmath34 ) .",
    "also the qcd coupling constant is smaller for bottomonium system .",
    "therefore , the characteristics of @xmath0 meson production are more appropriate for a correct test of the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "in this article we consider the polarization of @xmath0 mesons produced at fixed target energies .",
    "it will be shown that in the nrqcd factorization approach @xmath0 mesons are produced transversely polarized , whereas the cem predicts unpolarized bottomonium production .",
    "we present also numerical estimates of the projected statistical errors for the measurement of @xmath0 polarization at the hera-@xmath2 experiment at desy .    in the next section the bottomonium production in the various subprocesses",
    "is discussed . in section 3",
    "the @xmath0 polarization is calculated and numerical estimates for the expected @xmath0 signal to background ratio as well as for the errors of the polarization measurement are considered in the section 4 .",
    "in leading order in @xmath35 the different @xmath21- and @xmath36-wave quark - antiquark states can be produced in the following @xmath37 and @xmath38 subprocesses :    @xmath39 gluon - gluon fusion @xmath40",
    "@xmath39 gluon - quark scattering @xmath41    @xmath39 quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath42 where the superscripts ( 1,8 ) denote the color singlet and color octet states , respectively .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath0 production is given by the sum of direct production cross section and the cross section of @xmath43 states decaying through @xmath0 mesons : @xmath44 the production of each quarkonium state receives contributions from both color octet and color singlet states .",
    "the relative velocity for the bottomonium system is small , @xmath16 , and hence the production cross sections can be calculated with only the leading order color octet contribution taken into account .    in table",
    "i the color singlet and color octet long distance matrix elements for the production of @xmath43 states are presented .",
    "the values of matrix elements are taken from @xcite .",
    "the color singlet matrix elements are computed from the wave functions of the buchmller - tye potential tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath45 are fitted from the tevatron data @xcite . for the @xmath46 bottomonium state the value of this matrix element",
    "is obtained by extrapolation from @xmath47 and @xmath48 states @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table iii . * parameter @xmath49 obtained from the fit for different mc input values .",
    "we note that the expected statistical error on @xmath49 is largely dominated by the @xmath0 statistics rather than by the value of the background polarization and the signal to background ratio .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the statistical error @xmath50 as a function of the number of reconstructed @xmath0 events    l7.5 cm    for various @xmath49 s .",
    "as can be seen , an accuracy on the polarization parameter @xmath51 for @xmath52 can be achieved for one year of the hera-@xmath2 running .",
    "the expected error will allow to distinguish between @xmath53 ( cem ) and @xmath54 ( nrqcd fa ) with a @xmath55 significance .",
    "the polarization of @xmath0 mesons is calculated at fixed target energies ( @xmath56 gev ) .",
    "it is shown that in the nrqcd factorization approach @xmath0 mesons are expected to be produced transversely polarized ; the parameter @xmath49 for the polar angle distribution of quarkonium decay products is about @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , the color evaporation model postulates that multiple soft gluon exchange in the hadronization phase destroys the initial polarization of the heavy quark pair and quarkonium is produced unpolarized .",
    "higher twist effects are expected to be small due to the large mass of the @xmath58-quark . the contribution of higher fock states in bottomonium production",
    "are more suppressed than in the charmonium case , the relative velocity for the bottomonium family is about @xmath16 .",
    "thus the measurement of the @xmath0 polarization provides an excellent opportunity to test different mechanisms of heavy quarkonium production .",
    "in particular , it allows to distinguish between the nrqcd fa @xcite and the cem @xcite . on the other side",
    ", the observation of an extremely large polarization will indicate that @xmath0 mesons are mainly produced through color singlet states and that the color octet parameters for @xmath43 production extracted from the tevatron data should be much smaller than known at present .",
    "the monte carlo simulation shows that the projected statistical error for the measurement of the polarization parameter @xmath49 is about @xmath59 for @xmath60 in one year running of the hera-@xmath2 experiment .",
    "the simulation is done only for the @xmath61 decay channel .",
    "a statistics gain of almost a factor 2 is expected from the @xmath62 channel .",
    "the simulation conservatively assume the lowest value for the @xmath0 production cross section measured in different experiments @xcite at @xmath63 gev which corresponds to a hera proton beam momentum of @xmath64 gev / c ( the current value for hera is 920 gev / c )",
