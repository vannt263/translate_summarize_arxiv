    "precise determination of @xmath2 , a parameter of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , is an important goal of many experimental studies .",
    "the current experimental limit @xcite @xmath3 is based on measurements of the beauty hadron decays produced at the @xmath4 resonance ( by argus and by cleo ii ) and in @xmath5-boson decays ( by the four experiments at lep ) . in the future large samples of the @xmath1-hadrons collected at @xmath6-factories ( at slac and kek ) and at the hadron colliders",
    "will increase the statistical accuracy to a few percent level . to fully exploit the anticipated experimental improvement",
    ", the theoretical description of the @xmath1 decay must be known with comparable precision .",
    "there are two methods of extracting the value of @xmath2 , based on measurements of the exclusive decay @xmath7 and of the inclusive semileptonic decay width of @xmath1-hadrons @xmath8 .",
    "these two methods rely on very different theoretical considerations and experimental procedures and complement each other .",
    "their merits and theoretical uncertainties are summarized e.g.  in ref .",
    "one of the major sources of the theoretical error are the perturbative qcd corrections at the two loop level . for",
    "the exclusive decays at the zero recoil point these corrections have recently been calculated @xcite .",
    "this has significantly improved the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for the exclusive method .    regarding the inclusive method ,",
    "recently the @xmath0 corrections to differential semileptonic decay width of the @xmath1quark at maximal recoil have been calculated @xcite .",
    "combined with the previously obtained value at zero ( minimal ) recoil , these results permitted an estimate of the complete @xmath0 correction to the total semileptonic decay width of the @xmath1quark .    in the paper @xcite we presented the results of that calculation and discussed its phenomenological relevance .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is a detailed description of the methods employed in that calculation .",
    "we would like to note that a complete calculation of two - loop corrections to a fermion decay width has never been performed before , neither in qcd nor in qed ( a longstanding example are the two - loop qed corrections to the muon life time ) .",
    "therefore , in the calculation we describe here we had to go beyond the traditional methods used in higher  orders calculation .",
    "we hope that a description of some technical aspects and methods will be of interest for the community .",
    "let us first mention the difficulties one encounters when trying to compute the fourth order corrections to the fermion decays .",
    "one of the problems is an appropriate treatment of the real radiation of one or two gluons . for the virtual radiative corrections",
    "there exists a number of algorithms , permitting an efficient , analytical treatment of a large number of complicated diagrams , which typically appear in such calculations . on the contrary ,",
    "no similar algorithms were available so far for the treatment of the real radiation .",
    "the reason why the real radiation at order @xmath9 is difficult to evaluate is that the particle in the initial state ( the decaying @xmath1 quark ) carries a color charge and therefore can radiate .",
    "it is the presence of the massive propagator of the initial quark which makes the integrations over the phase space very tough .",
    "the kinematical configuration , where the invariant mass of the leptons is equal to zero and the quark in the final state is massive is the first case where a complete analytical evaluation of the real radiation of two gluons in a decay of a fermion turns out possible .",
    "another potential problem is the treatment of diagrams which represent one  loop virtual corrections to a single gluon emission in the @xmath1quark decay .",
    "the virtual corrections in such situation are one  loop",
    ". therefore one might naively expect that this case does not require any sophisticated investigation .",
    "unfortunately , the integration of the one  loop formulas ( especially of the boxes ) over the three body phase space is difficult .",
    "however , it turns out possible to express the result for the loop as an expansion which can be easily integrated over the phase space . with a systematic algorithm for the expansion ,",
    "this approach shifts the burden of the calculation to the computer .",
    "the idea which permitted us to calculate the contribution of the real radiation of one or two gluons is ( qualitatively speaking ) the expansion in the velocity of the final quark . in the limit",
    "@xmath10 the charm quark in the final state is a slowly moving particle , with spatial components of its momentum of the order of @xmath11 , much smaller than its mass .",
    "the momenta of gluons and of leptons ( in the case when the invariant mass of the leptons is zero ) are also of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that by a proper choice of the phase space variables one can systematically expand the amplitudes and the phase space in @xmath13 ( sometimes we also use an equivalent expansion parameter @xmath14 ; throughout this paper we use @xmath15 as the unit of mass , putting @xmath16 ) .",
    "the details of the phase space parameterization will be explained in detail .",
    "a word of caution is in order here .",
    "our technique proved to be very useful in problems where the mass of the quark in the final state does not differ too much from the mass of the quark in the initial state . in this respect",
    "an ideal application are semileptonic @xmath17 transitions . on the other hand , for such problems as muon or top quark decay , the expansion parameter may be close to unity and it is not clear at present if our procedure is of any use there .",
    "we will , however , show an example where our procedure remains meaningful and delivers reliable predictions even in the case when the expansion parameter equals unity .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss how the real radiation of two gluons can be computed .",
    "section [ sec : tensors ] is devoted to the treatment of tensor integrals .",
    "then we present a detailed study of one  loop virtual corrections to a single gluon emission in the @xmath1decay .",
    "we show that in such diagrams a new type of feynman integrals appears and discuss their evaluation .",
    "section [ sec : applic ] is devoted to the applications of our techniques .",
    "we present the result for the @xmath18 correction to the differential semileptonic decay width @xmath19 up to @xmath20 .",
    "we also demonstrate how the known light quark corrections to the top quark decay width can be obtained with good accuracy if the expansion up to high powers of @xmath21 is performed , and discuss an application of our technique to corrections to the zero recoil sum rules . in the last section we present conclusions .",
    "we first consider the radiation of two real gluons in a semileptonic @xmath1decay @xmath23 and discuss how its contribution to the width can be computed .    throughout this paper",
    "we denote the particles and their four - momenta by the same letters , i.e.  the momentum of the @xmath1quark is @xmath1 etc .",
    "moreover , we denote the momentum of the lepton pair @xmath24 as @xmath25 and often speak about the decay @xmath26 . all formulas in this paper",
    "apply to the case when the invariant mass of the leptons is zero , i.e. @xmath27 , if not stated otherwise .",
    "our aim is to construct an expansion in @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the spatial momentum of the @xmath29 quark is of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "the momenta of the lepton pair and of the gluons are also of the order of @xmath12 because @xmath30 .",
    "the smallness of these momenta permits an expansion in terms of @xmath31 .      to show that such an expansion is indeed possible , we list here all propagators of the virtual particles which appear in a calculation of the two gluon emission in the semileptonic @xmath1decay : @xmath32 all these propagators",
    "are shown in the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : propagators ] .",
    "if we eliminate the momentum of the @xmath29 quark using momentum conservation , @xmath33 , we can expand the propagators @xmath34 in the taylor series with respect to the `` small '' momenta @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath25 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath37^j}{[2b(g_1+g_2)-2g_1g_2]^j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these expressions we see that the expansion does not generate any new infrared divergences and , therefore , appears to be permissible . after this expansion only four different types of denominators remain .",
    "we list them for clarity : @xmath38 as will become clear from the discussion below , it is more convenient to use @xmath39 as one of the basic propagators than to expand it any further .",
    "let us emphasize at this point the advantages of the above expansion .",
    "as can be seen from the above expressions , the four  momentum of lepton pair @xmath25 and the momentum of the @xmath29quark do not appear in the denominator .",
    "this immediately implies that the integral over the phase space of @xmath25 and @xmath29 factorizes .",
    "therefore , the expansion suggests a simple way how the rather nontrivial integration over the phase space of four particles in the final state can be reduced to a more familiar case of the three body phase space . this reduction is described in the next section .      after we have checked that the propagators of all virtual particles can be expanded , the same must be demonstrated for the phase space element",
    "this is done in the present section .",
    "considering the semileptonic decay of the @xmath1quark and integrating first over the lepton phase space , one obtains the following phase space integration element ( we consider only the point where the invariant mass of the lepton pair @xmath40 is zero ) : @xmath41[dw][dg_1][dg_2 ] \\delta^d ( b - c - g_1-g_2-w),\\ ] ] where a shorthand notation is @xmath42 = \\frac { { \\rm d}^{d-1}p}{2p^0},\\qquad d=4 - 2\\epsilon.\\ ] ] it is convenient to introduce an auxiliary vector @xmath43 which equals to the sum of the momenta of the @xmath29quark and @xmath25 boson , @xmath44 . with this notation",
    "the phase space integral becomes @xmath45 [ dg_1][dg_2 ]   \\delta^d ( b - h - g_1-g_2 ) \\int [ dw][dc ] \\delta^d ( h - w -c).\\ ] ] the integration over the @xmath46 phase space gives ( for now we assume the integrand contains no @xmath25 in the numerator ; the tensor integrals with @xmath25 dependence will be analyzed in section [ sec : tensors ] ) @xmath47[dc ] \\delta^d ( h - w -c)=   \\frac { \\omega _ { d-1}}{2^{d-1 } } \\frac { ( h^2-m_c^2)^{d-3}}{(h^2)^{d/2 - 1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the volume of a @xmath49 dimensional sphere of a unit radius .",
    "having performed the integration over the @xmath46 phase space we are left with the three particle phase space of one massive ( @xmath43 ) and two massless ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) particles and the integration over the square of the momentum @xmath43 .",
    "we use the variables ( with @xmath50 ) @xmath51 and get the following expression for the four particle phase space @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 and the following limits of integrations @xmath54 in order to expand the phase space element in powers of @xmath55 it is useful to change the variables in the above expression @xmath56 the integration limits for all @xmath57 are the same : @xmath58 expressing the phase  space element through these variables and restoring proper dimensionality we find : @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60    our final aim is to expand @xmath61 in the limit of @xmath62 .",
    "the above expression is well suited for this purpose . expanding it in powers of @xmath63 gives rise to simple integrals which can be expressed by beta functions : @xmath64      the basic propagators @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath39 , and @xmath67 , expressed in terms of the variables @xmath68 yield simple expressions which can be integrated over the phase space .",

    "p_3 ^ 0 & = & \\frac { 1}{2b(g_1+g_2)-2g_1g_2 } = \\frac { 1}{\\beta x_1},\\qquad   p_7 = \\frac { 1}{2g_1g_2 } =   \\frac { 1-\\beta x_1 x_2}{\\beta^2 x_1 ^ 2 x_2 ( 1-x_2 ) x_3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , the expansion of these quantities in terms of small @xmath70 is readily performed .",
    "the resulting integrals are very similar to the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) and can be expressed in terms of the beta functions .",
    "the same is true for all scalar products of the four momenta which enter the calculation .",
    "therefore , the above discussion demonstrates that the part of the semileptonic decay width of the @xmath1quark containing radiation of two gluons can be calculated by expanding the matrix element and the four particle phase space in powers of @xmath70 .",
    "what is still missing in our discussion is the study of the integrals over the @xmath46 phase space when the numerator depends on @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next section .",
    "the expansion of the propagators in terms of the momenta @xmath25 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , may result in high powers of the scalar products @xmath71 , which have to be integrated over the @xmath46 phase space . in this section we present efficient methods for such integrations .",
    "the results of this section are not restricted to the case @xmath27 and are likely to be useful for solving other problems .    the main object we are going to discuss is the following integral over the @xmath46 phase space : @xmath72[dc ] \\delta^d ( h - w -c ) ( wg_1)^a ( wg_2)^b   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\langle   ( wg_1)^a ( wg_2)^b \\rangle _ { h = w+c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for arbitrary @xmath73 . this integral can be rewritten as @xmath74 the important property of the tensor @xmath75 is that it depends on a single external vector only ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this property simplifies the calculation of the necessary integrals .",
    "we discuss below two approaches to such calculation ; their relative merits depend on the capabilities of the symbolic manipulation languages , if the algorithm is to be implemented using a computer .",
    "the first approach is more general and potentially more efficient . to fully exploit the dependence on the single external momentum",
    "we can extract the component of the vector @xmath25 which is parallel to it .",
    "for this purpose we write : @xmath76 the value of @xmath77 is then fixed , because in the general case @xmath78 we have @xmath79 therefore , if we use the above substitution for @xmath25 in the tensor integral @xmath80 , we obtain a sum of tensor integrals over transverse components of the @xmath25 ( with respect to @xmath43 ) : @xmath81 evidently , the tensor structure of this integral is trivial : since @xmath82 , @xmath83 must be proportional to the _ absolutely symmetric tensor _ of the @xmath84 dimensional space .",
    "the `` building block '' is the metric tensor of @xmath84 dimensional space : @xmath85 .",
    "we note that only tensors of _ even _ rank contribute .",
    "the generation of the absolutely symmetric tensor of @xmath49 dimensional space can be easily encoded in a symbolic manipulation program .",
    "hence , the algorithm described above permits an efficient treatment of the tensor integrals which appear in the problem at hand .      using the same idea as in the previous section we can advance slightly further with the analytical calculation of the integral @xmath86 .    after writing @xmath87 and noticing that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants in the @xmath46 phase space ,",
    "we conclude that the non - trivial integrals to be computed are @xmath90 with @xmath91 ( i=1,2 ) defined in analogy to @xmath92 .",
    "the integral @xmath93 is a lorentz  scalar and we can choose an arbitrary frame for its calculation .",
    "for instance , we consider @xmath43 to have only the zeroth component and put the @xmath94axis of the @xmath49 dimensional space along the vector @xmath95 .",
    "then , rewriting @xmath96 as @xmath97 we find that @xmath98 is expressed as a sum of integrals of the from : @xmath99 this integral is non - zero only if both @xmath100 and @xmath1 are even integers .    since @xmath101",
    ", we can put the @xmath102-axis of the @xmath49 dimensional space along the vector @xmath103 .",
    "then we have : @xmath104 the integration element is @xmath105 if we choose @xmath94 and @xmath102 axes as described above , we get @xmath106 the minus sign in the above equations arises because the transverse vectors here are spacelike . in calculating @xmath107 the following formula is useful : @xmath108 this formula is valid for even and positive @xmath70 . using it we get the result for the integral @xmath107 : @xmath109 in order to use these results for the further integration over the phase space @xmath110 it is necessary to express the modulus of the vectors @xmath92 , @xmath95 , @xmath103 in terms of the variables @xmath111 introduced in the previous section .",
    "this is a cumbersome but straightforward task and we do not discuss it here in any detail .",
    "the steps described above allow an easy implementation in any symbolic manipulation program .",
    "they provide an efficient and uniform treatment of the tensor integrals which appear in this calculation .",
    "another source of the @xmath112 corrections are the one  loop virtual corrections accompanied by a radiation of an additional real gluon .",
    "again , we would like to expand those diagrams in powers of @xmath113 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide a suitable algorithm .",
    "there is a principal difference from the radiation of two real gluons in this part of the corrections .",
    "namely , it is not sufficient here to perform a taylor expansion of the relevant diagrams .    to see this ,",
    "let us analyze a simple example .",
    "we consider a diagram where the @xmath1quark radiates a gluon and then a one  loop self  energy correction is inserted on the @xmath1 quark line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simplest ] ) . taking the limit",
    "@xmath114 in such situation implies that the momentum of the real gluon goes to zero .",
    "therefore the self  energy diagram should be calculated close to the mass shell of the @xmath1quark .",
    "it is well  known that in this limit the self  energy diagram has an on - shell logarithmic singularity of the form @xmath115    since this diagram contains @xmath116 it is clear that it can not be calculated as a taylor expansion with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated procedure is needed and the method of _ eikonal expansions _",
    "@xcite is used in this case .",
    "we illustrate this approach in the following example .      in this subsection we consider a simple example of a one  loop integral , where a result obtained from the eikonal expansion can be compared with an exact formula .",
    "we calculate the scalar self  energy diagram : @xmath117}. \\label { example}\\ ] ] performing feynman parameterization , integrating over the loop momenta , and expanding in @xmath118 we get ( using @xmath119 here ) : @xmath120    the appearance of the @xmath121 term in this result signals that the taylor expansion of the _ integrand _ will be insufficient . in order to get the correct result we add the eikonal expansion . for this purpose",
    "we write @xmath122 the taylor expansion term @xmath123 is obtained by expanding the integrand in ( [ example ] ) in a taylor series in @xmath124 .",
    "this yields a set of one  loop on  shell integrals which are well known .",
    "the validity of such an expansion is determined by the condition @xmath125 .",
    "if this is not the case , the taylor expansion breaks down .",
    "this breakdown gives rise to an infrared singularity which occurs in the region where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this spurious divergence can be cancelled by adding an expansion of the integrand in @xmath128 ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "one should note in addition that if any power of @xmath128 appears in the numerator we get an integral of the form : @xmath129 an important point is that such integrals are zero within the dimensional regularization framework .",
    "one simple reason for this is that the integral over transverse components of @xmath130 is scaleless .",
    "hence , the only term in the eikonal expansion we should consider is the one with @xmath128 neglected in the second propagator .",
    "the eikonal integral therefore reads : @xmath131 it is evident that this integral scales with @xmath124 as @xmath132 .",
    "it is this dependence on @xmath133 which gives @xmath134 in the final result .",
    "consider @xmath135 in the rest frame of @xmath136 . performing the integration over the time component of the loop momenta first",
    ", one gets a simple integral representation over the transverse components of the loop momenta which can be easily calculated .",
    "more sophisticated eikonal integrals are considered in the next section , where all necessary formulas can be found .      here",
    "we provide a set of formulas for dealing with integrals appearing in the eikonal expansions .",
    "as is clear from the example presented above , the region of integration in which we are interested here is characterized by the values of the virtual momentum of the order of the momentum of the real gluon emitted in the decay .",
    "we denote the loop momentum by @xmath130 and the momentum of the real gluon by @xmath137 ; explicitly , the eikonal expansion of the propagator @xmath138 is given by @xmath139    the basic eikonal integral in the one  loop correction then reads . ]",
    "@xmath140    in the actual calculation @xmath141 is always a _ time  like _ vector which for different diagrams can be @xmath142 .    as we pointed out above ,",
    "the integrals with any power of @xmath128 in the numerator vanish .",
    "there are several ways to see this .",
    "first , the integrals over transverse ( with respect to @xmath141 ) components of the loop momenta are scaleless ; also if there is no @xmath128 in the denominator , the poles of the integrand are located only on one side of the @xmath143 integration axis . also , if @xmath144 , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eik ] ) is zero because it is scaleless .",
    "let us describe the most economic way to calculate @xmath145 .",
    "we choose the lorentz frame in which @xmath146 .",
    "the integration over the time - like component of the vector @xmath130 can be performed using the residues . if the integration contour is closed in the upper half ",
    "plane , only that pole in @xmath147 contributes for which @xmath148 .",
    "after @xmath149 , the integration over the @xmath49 dimensional space should be performed . to discuss the integration over @xmath150",
    "we first note that after integrating over @xmath149 the denominator of the integral @xmath151 depends on @xmath152 only .",
    "therefore , all tensor integrals which appear due to the numerator structure are simply related to the @xmath49 absolutely symmetric tensor of the corresponding rank . hence",
    ", the tensor integrals here are similar to the ones discussed in section [ sec : tensors ] .",
    "finally , we are left with the radial integration over the modulus of @xmath153 .",
    "the following formulas are useful : @xmath154,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath155 in the above formulas @xmath156 is the volume of the @xmath49 dimensional sphere of unit radius .",
    "there is one subtle point concerning the expressions presented above .",
    "namely , it is easy to see that the integrals @xmath157 have an additional singularity after the integration over @xmath149 has been performed .",
    "this singularity corresponds to the appearance of the imaginary part in some of feynman diagrams which contribute to the result .",
    "below we explain how this singularity was treated .    in the singular integrals",
    "the integration over the modulus of the transverse momenta is @xmath158 the singularity is located at the point @xmath159 . to make this integral meaningful we rewrite it as @xmath160 rescaling @xmath161 we get : @xmath162 for the derivative we use @xmath163 finally , after performing the remaining integration over @xmath150 using @xmath164 we arrive at the formula for @xmath165 quoted above .      the graphs with a triple gluon coupling lead to the most difficult eikonal integrals .",
    "the difficulty originates from the fact that in such graphs one has two massless ( gluon ) propagators .",
    "a typical integral reads @xmath166    the taylor expansion of such integral is easy .",
    "however , in the eikonal expansion one can not expand massless propagators .",
    "therefore , the master integral in this case is @xmath167 where @xmath141 is again a `` large '' time - like vector , as described in the previous section .",
    "note also , that in this case the terms with @xmath128 or @xmath168 in the numerator do contribute to the result .",
    "let us describe in detail how such integrals can be calculated .",
    "for this purpose we first combine the massless denominators : @xmath169 next , we decompose the product of two eikonal propagators @xmath170 using partial fractions .",
    "the integral @xmath171 becomes now a sum of the integrals of the following type : @xmath172 ^ 2 ( 2kq-2gq)^n } , \\nonumber \\\\ i_2(n)&=&\\int _ { 0}^{1}~{\\rm d } x~\\int \\frac { { \\rm d}^dk}{(2\\pi)^d }   \\frac { 1}{[(k - gx)^2]^2 ( 2kq)^n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in both integrals we shift the integration momentum @xmath173 and get @xmath174^n } , \\nonumber \\\\ i_2(n)&=&\\int _ { 0}^{1}~{\\rm d } x~\\int \\frac { { \\rm d}^dk}{(2\\pi)^d }   \\frac { 1}{(k^2)^2 ( 2kq+2gqx)^n}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , in the first integral one makes the change of variables @xmath175 and then rescales the integration momenta @xmath176 in both @xmath177 and @xmath178 . the integration over @xmath102 factorizes and can be done using @xmath179    the integrals over @xmath130 differ from the integral in the previous section by the presence of two powers of @xmath128 in the denominator . in this case",
    "it is useful to perform a transformation ( similar to the technique of integration by parts @xcite ) , which reduces the integrals with the second power of @xmath128 in the denominator to the integrals with the first power only .    to write down this transformation",

    "@xmath206 is the number of light quark flavors whose masses were neglected .    in ref .",

    "it is well known that this decay width ( at least at the born and the one  loop level ) can be well approximated by neglecting the masses of the @xmath25boson and the @xmath1quark . in such case , since @xmath212 , the techniques presented in the main part of this paper can be readily applied .",
    "in particular , the formula ( [ eq : param ] ) can be rewritten in such form that it gives the correction to the two - body decay width @xmath213 ( where @xmath141 is a heavy quark ) : @xmath214.\\ ] ] the @xmath215 functions here are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : param ] ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath216 replaced by @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the problem , however , is that the procedures described above were based on the expansion of the rate in the mass difference of the final and initial quarks . in the case of the top quark decay with a @xmath1 quark in the final state",
    "this means that the expansion parameter @xmath219 is close to 1 for realistic values of @xmath217 and @xmath15 .",
    "little is known about convergence properties of the series described in this paper .",

    "we can use that limiting case to check if we can reproduce it with our techniques .",

    "\\widetilde\\gamma _ 0 & = & \\frac { g_f~m_t^3}{8\\ ; \\sqrt { 2}\\;\\pi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be mentioned that the diagrams with real or virtual massless fermions represent the simplest case for the described algorithms .",
    "the reason is their simple planar topology , which allows the computer programs to work very fast .",
    "for this particular type of diagrams we can expand the width up to a very high power in @xmath31 .",
    "we write the result of this expansion as @xmath223 where the function @xmath224 is given as a series of powers and logs of @xmath31 ; we have computed this expansion up to terms of the order @xmath225 .",
    "the first few terms of that expansion are given by the function @xmath226 in the appendix .",
    "the numerical value of the exact result is @xmath227 the values of the approximate result @xmath224 for @xmath228 are , for three numbers @xmath229 of the summed terms , @xmath230    comparing these numbers with the exact result we see that already the first 11 terms of the expansion give the accuracy of about @xmath231 .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy does not improve significantly with the growing number of terms in the expansion .",
    "this slow convergence of the series is caused by the logarithms of the small ( @xmath1 quark ) mass .",
    "although these terms are suppressed by powers of that mass ( and should give no contribution to the final result if @xmath232 ) , they spoil the convergence of the expansion",
    ". it would be very useful ( and we think it is possible ) to find a systematic way of eliminating those parts of the integrands which give rise to these logs .    on the other hand , from the perspective of practical applications ( like top physics at the next linear collider )",
    "it would be sufficient to know the two  loop qcd correction to the top quark decay width even with @xmath233 percent accuracy .",
    "it is tempting to apply our algorithms to this problem and extrapolate the result to the point @xmath234 ; on the other hand , at present we do not know any reliable method for estimating the uncertainty of such result .",
    "another useful application of the techniques described above is connected with the so - called zero recoil ( zr ) sum rules @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we would like to discuss this point",
    ". a more detailed discussion of zr sum rules with the @xmath0 corrections will be given in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the zr sum rules are important for the estimates of the zero recoil transition form factors such as @xmath235 for @xmath236 transition or @xmath237 for @xmath238 transition . in turn",
    ", the formfactor @xmath235 is a crucial ingredient for @xmath2 determination from the exclusive semileptonic @xmath239 decays .    the sum rules for exclusive heavy  to  heavy flavor transitions are based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the hadronic amplitudes in terms of the inverse quark masses .",
    "the zeroth order term in this expansion is the parton model where free quarks are substituted for real hadrons both in initial and final state .",
    "here we disregard the non - perturbative corrections and discuss how the perturbative corrections @xmath0 to the sum rules can be evaluated .",
    "we consider a transition of a @xmath1 quark at rest to a @xmath29 quark and massless partons which occurs under the influence of the external current @xmath240 .",
    "the momentum carried away by the external current is @xmath241 , where @xmath242    the quantity which is of primary importance for the perturbative corrections to zr sum rules can be schematically written as : @xmath243 both on the external momenta transfer @xmath244 and on the lorentz structure of the current .    if @xmath245 , the transition is elastic",
    "; the final state is a single @xmath29quark at rest .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections in this case reduce to the renormalization of the external current @xmath240 . for vector and axial currents",
    "they were calculated in @xcite .    on the other hand , if @xmath246 the @xmath29 quark starts moving and can radiate .",
    "the second order corrections @xmath247 were calculated in @xcite .",
    "aiming at the fourth order , i.e. at @xmath248 accuracy , one has to consider the final state with the @xmath29quark and two real gluons or light quarks and also the @xmath247 correction to the single gluon emission in @xmath17 transition .    due to the hierarchy of scales , @xmath249",
    ", the final @xmath29quark is moving slowly by definition ; this is therefore a nice place where the techniques described in this paper can be applied . in particular ,",
    "an algorithm for performing eikonal expansions with the subsequent integration over the phase space appears to be very useful here .",
    "this topic will be discussed in detail in ref .",
    "in this paper we have described techniques used in the calculation of the @xmath0 corrections to the semileptonic decay width @xmath190 at maximal recoil @xcite .",
    "the technical tool we used for that calculation is an expansion of the decay rate in powers and logarithms of the mass difference between the initial and final quarks .",
    "we presented a detailed discussion of the algorithm , which enables one to construct such expansion .",
    "we treated virtual corrections , emission of one gluon , and emission of two gluons separately .",
    "therefore , these algorithms can be used for the analyses of less inclusive quantities than the total decay rate , at least in principle .    in case of two  loop virtual corrections and emission of two real gluons ,",
    "the expansion in @xmath113 is a taylor expansion . in the case of one ",
    "loop corrections to the amplitude of single gluon emission in @xmath1-decay , the taylor expansion is insufficient . an appropriate method is provided by the eikonal expansions , recently introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . when this procedure is used , a new type of feynman integrals appears .",
    "these integrals and methods which were used for their evaluation were described here in some detail .",
    "the whole construction works well if the mass difference between initial and final state quarks is not too large .",
    "this is the case for the semileptonic @xmath17 transitions , where the expansion parameter @xmath250 . in this case",
    "we calculated the expansion up to the eleventh power of @xmath31 ; the estimated accuracy of the final result is better than @xmath251 .",
    "there is , however , a number of other applications where the initial quark is significantly heavier than the final one .",
    "it is not obvious to what extend the present method can be useful in such situation .",
    "there is an indication , however , that our procedures give meaningful results even in that limit . as an example , we analyzed the light quark corrections to the width of the top quark decay into massless @xmath25 boson and a @xmath1-quark .",
    "we have shown that the first several terms of the expansion in @xmath252 approximate the known exact result with a @xmath253 accuracy .",
    "finally , we have argued that the same techniques can be applied to the corrections to the zero recoil sum rules for the heavy flavor transitions .",
