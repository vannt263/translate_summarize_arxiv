    "given the current landscape in experimental high - energy physics , these lectures are focused on applications of event generators for hadron colliders like the tevatron and lhc . much of it would also be relevant for @xmath0 machines like lep and ilc or @xmath1 machines like hera , but with some differences not discussed here .",
    "heavy - ion physics is not at all addressed , since it involves rather different aspects , specifically the potential formation of a quark  gluon plasma .",
    "further , within the field of high - energy @xmath2 collisions , the emphasis will be on the common aspects of qcd physics that occurs in all collisions , rather on those aspect that are specific to a particular physics topic , such as @xmath3 production or supersymmetry .",
    "both heavy ions and other physics topics are instead covered by other lectures at this school .",
    "section 2 contains a first overview of the physics picture and the generator landscape .",
    "thereafter section 3 describes the usage of matrix elements , section 4 the important topics of initial- and final - state showers , and section 5 how showers can be matched to different hard processes .",
    "the issue of multiple interactions and their role in mimimum - bias and underlying - event physics is introduced in section 6 , followed by some brief comments on hadronization in section 7 .",
    "the article concludes with an outlook on the ongoing generator - development work in section 8 .",
    "slides for these and other similar lectures @xcite are complementary to this writeup in style and contents , including many ( colour ) illustrations absent here .",
    "other useful resources include the `` les houches guidebook to monte carlo generators for hadron collider physics '' @xcite and a recent review on qcd physics at the tevatron and lhc @xcite .",
    "in real life , machines produce events that are stored by the data acquisition system of a detector . in the virtual reality",
    ", event generators like herwig @xcite and pythia @xcite play the role of machines like the tevatron and lhc , and detector simulation programs like geant  4 @xcite the role of detectors like atlas or cms .",
    "the real and virtual worlds can share the same event reconstruction framework and subsequent physics analysis .",
    "it is by understanding how an original physics input is distorted step - by - step in the better - controlled virtual world that an understanding can be gained of what may be going on in the real world . for approximate studies",
    "the detector simulation and reconstruction steps can be shortcut , so that generators can be used directly in the physics studies .",
    "a number of physics analyses would not be feasible without generators . specifically , a proper understanding of the ( potential ) signal and background processes is important to separate the two .",
    "the key aspect of generators here is that they provide a detailed description of the final state so that , ideally , any experimental observable or combination of observables can be predicted and compared with data . thereby generators can be used at various stages of an experiment : when optimizing the detector and its trigger design to the intended physics program , when estimating the feasibility of a specific physics study , when devising analysis strategies , when evaluating acceptance corrections , and so on .",
    "however , it should always be kept in mind that generators are not perfect .",
    "they suffer from having to describe a broad range of physics , some of which is known from first principles , while other parts are modelled in different frameworks .",
    "( in the latter case , a generator actually acts as a vehicle of ideology , where ideas are disseminated in prepackaged form from theorists to experimentalists . )",
    "given the limited resources , different authors may also have invested more or less time on specific physics topics , and therefore these may be more or less well modelled .",
    "it always pays to shop around , and to compare several approaches before drawing too definite conclusions .",
    "blind usage of a generator is not encouraged : then you are the slave rather than the master .    why then _",
    "monte carlo _ event generators ?",
    "basically because einstein was wrong : god does throw dice ! in quantum meachanics , calculations provide the _ probability _ for different outcomes of a measurement .",
    "event - by - event , it is impossible to know beforehand what will happen : anything that is at all allowed could be next .",
    "it is only when averaging over large event samples that the expected probability distributions emerge  provided we did the right calculation to high enough accuracy . in generators , ( pseuo)random numbers are used to make choices intended to reproduce the quantum mechanical probabilities for different outcomes at various stages of the process .",
    "the buildup of the structure in an event occurs in several steps , and can be summarized as follows :    * initially two hadrons are coming in on a collision course .",
    "each hadron can be viewed as a bag of partons  quarks and gluons . *",
    "a collision between two partons , one from each side , gives the hard process of interest , be it for physics within or beyond the standard model : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc .",
    "( actually , the bulk of the cross section results in rather mundane events , with at most rather soft jets , or of a simple elastic or diffractive character that is not easily described as partonic processes .",
    "such events usually are filtered away at an early stage , however . ) * when short - lived `` resonances '' are produced in the hard process , such as the top , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , their decay has to be viewed as part of this process itself , since e.g. spin correlations are transferred from the production to the decay stages .",
    "* a collision implies accelerated colour ( and often electromagnetic ) charges , and thereby bremsstrahlung can occur .",
    "emissions that can be associated with the two incoming colliding partons are called initial - state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "as we shall see , such emissions can be modelled by so - called space - like parton showers .",
    "* emissions that can be associated with outgoing partons are instead called final - state radiation ( fsr ) , and can be approximated be time - like parton showers .",
    "often the distinction between a hard process and isr and fsr is ambiguous , as we shall see .",
    "* so far we only extracted one parton from each incoming hadron to undergo a hard collision .",
    "but the hadron is made up of a multitude of further partons , and so further parton pairs may collide within one single hadron ",
    "hadron collision  multiple interactions ( mi ) .",
    "( not to be confused with pileup events , when several hadron pairs collide during a bunch  bunch crossing , but with obvious analogies . )",
    "* each of these further collisions also may be associated with its isr and fsr . *",
    "the colliding partons take a fraction of the energy of the incoming hadrons , but much of the energy remains in the beam remnants , which continue to travel essentially in the original directions",
    ". these remnants also carry colours that compensate the colour taken away by the colliding partons .",
    "* at short timescales , when partons are close to each other , the principle of asymptotic freedom tells us that we can think of each parton as freely moving along its trajectory .",
    "however , as time goes by and the partons recede from each other , confinement forces become significant . the structure and time evolution of these force fields can not be described from first principles within any calculational technique currently at our disposal , so models have to be introduced .",
    "one common approach is to assume that a separate confinement field is stretched between each colour and its matching anticolour , with each gluon considered as a simple sum of a colour and an anticolour , and all colours distinguishable from each other ( the @xmath9 limit ) .",
    "* such fields can break up by the production of new quark ",
    "antiquark pairs that screen the endpoint colours , and where a quark from one break ( or from an endpoint ) can combine with an antiquark from an adjacent break to produce a primary hadron .",
    "this process is called hadronization .",
    "* many of those primary hadrons are unstable and decay further at various timescales .",
    "some are sufficiently long  lived that their decays are visible in a detector , or are ( almost ) stable .",
    "thereby we have reached scales where the event - generator description has to be matched to a detector - simulation framework . *",
    "it is only at this stage that experimental information can be obtained and used to reconstruct back what may have happened at the core of the process , e.g.  whether a higgs particle was produced or not .",
    "the monte carlo method allows these steps to be considered sequentially , and within each step to define a set of rules that can be used iteratively to construct a more and more complex state , maybe ending with hundreds of particles moving out in different directions .",
    "since each particle contains of the order of ten degrees of freedom ( flavour , mass , momentum , production vertex , lifetime ,  ) we realize that thousands of choices are involved for a typical event .",
    "the aim is to have a sufficiently realistic description of these choices that both the average behaviour and the fluctuations around this average are well decribed .",
    "schematically , the cross section for a range of final states is provided by @xmath10 properly integrated over the relevant phase - space regions and summed over possible `` paths '' ( of showering , hadronization , etc . ) that lead from a hard process to the final state .",
    "that is , the dimensional quantities are associated with the hard process ; subsequent steps are handled in a probabilistic approach .",
    "the spectrum of event generators is very broad , from general - purpose ones to more specialized ones .",
    "herwig and pythia are the two most commonly used among the former ones , with isajet @xcite and sherpa @xcite as the other two main programs in this category . among more specialized programs , many deal with the matrix elements for some specific set of processes , a few with topics such as parton showers or particle decays , but there are e.g.  no freestanding programs that handle hadronization . in the end , many of the specialized programs are therefore used as `` plugins '' for the general - purpose ones .",
    "from the lagrangian of a theory the feynman rules can be derived , and from them matrix elements can be calculated .",
    "combined with phase space it allows the calculation of cross sections .",
    "as a simple example consider the scattering of quarks in qcd , say @xmath11 , a process similar to rutherford scattering but with gluon exchange instead of photon ditto .",
    "the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the cm frame of the collision",
    "@xmath15 is the squared total energy and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the scattering angle .",
    "the differential cross section is then @xmath18 which diverges roughly like @xmath19 for transverse momentum @xmath20 .",
    "we will come back to this issue when discussing multiple interactions ; for now suffice to say that some lower cutoff @xmath21 need to be introduced .",
    "similar cross sections , differing mainly by colour factors , are obtained for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a few further qcd graphs , like @xmath24 , are less singular and give smaller contributions .",
    "these cross sections then have to be convoluted with the flux of the incoming partons @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the two incoming hadrons @xmath27 and @xmath3 : @xmath28 the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of gluons and sea quarks are strongly peaked at small momentum fractions @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "this further enhances the peaking of the cross section at small @xmath31 values .",
    "nevertheless , with high machine luminosity the jet cross section can be studied out to quite high values .",
    "the cross section of other processes can be suppressed by two main effects .",
    "firstly , for massive particles the @xmath31 spectrum is strongly dampened below the respective mass scale , and it is only above it that these precesses have a chance to stand up above the qcd background .",
    "secondly , the processes may involve electroweak ( or other small ) couplings rather than strong ones .    in order to address",
    "the physics of interest a large number of processes , both within the standard model and in various extensions of it , have to be available in generators .",
    "indeed many can also be found in the general - purpose ones , but by far not enough .",
    "further , often processes are there available only to lowest order , while experimental interest may be in higher orders , with more jets in the final state , either as a signal or as a potential background .",
    "so a wide spectrum of matrix - element - centered programs are available @xcite , some quite specialized and others more generic .",

    "nevertheless we did not tame the fact that probabilities blow up in the soft and collinear regions .",

    "assume that players are equally energetic and skillful from the first minute of the match to the last .",
    "then the chances of scoring a goal is uniform in time , but the probability of scoring the _ first _ goal of the match is bigger at the beginning , because later on any goal could well be the second or third .    in physics",
    "a common example is that of radioactive decay .",
    "if the number of undecayed radioactive nuclei at time @xmath113 is @xmath114 , with initial number @xmath115 at time @xmath116 , then a naive ansatz would be @xmath117 , where @xmath68 parametrizes the decay likelihood per unit of time .",
    "this equation has the solution @xmath118 , which becomes negative for @xmath119 , because by then the probability for having had a decay exceeds unity .",
    "so what we made wrong was not to take into account that only an undecayed nucleus can decay , i.e.  that the equation ought to have been @xmath120 with the solution @xmath121 .",
    "this is a nicely well - behaved expression , where the total probability for decays goes to unity only for @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath68 had not been a constant but varied in time , @xmath123 , it is simple to show that the solution instead would have become @xmath124    for a shower the relevant `` time '' scale is something like @xmath125 , by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "that is , instead of evolving to later and later times we evolve to smaller and smaller @xmath43 .",
    "thereby the dglap eq .",
    "( [ eq : dglap ] ) becomes @xmath126 where the exponent ( or simple variants thereof ) is the sudakov factor . as for the radioactive - decay example",

    ". then you may have sequential radioactive decay chains , and you may have sequential parton branchings , but that is another story .    it is a bit deeper than that , however .",
    "just as the standard branching expressions can be viewed as approximations to the complete matrix elements for real emission , the sudakov is an approximation to the complete virtual corrections from loop graphs .",
    "the divergences in real and virtual emissions , so strange - looking in the matrix - element language , here naturally combine to provide a physical answer everywhere .",
    "what is not described in the shower , of course , is the non - universal finite parts of the real and virtual matrix elements .",
    "the implementation of a cascade evolution now makes sense . starting from a simple @xmath99 system the @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "are individually evolved downwards from some initial @xmath127 until they branch . at a branching the mother parton",
    "disappears and is replaced by two daughter partons , which in their turn are evolved downwards in @xmath43 and may branch .",
    "thereby the number of partons increases , until the lower cutoff scale is reached .",
    "this does not mean that everything is uniquely specified .",
    "in particular , the choice of evolving in @xmath128 is by no means obvious .",
    "any alternative variable @xmath129 would work equally well , since @xmath130 .",
    "alternative evolution variables therefore include the transverse momentum , @xmath131 , and the energy - weighted emission angle @xmath132 .",
    "both these two alternative choices are favourable when the issue of _ coherence _ is introduced .",
    "coherence means that emissions do not occur independently .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath133 , followed by an emission of a gluon either from 2 or 3 .",
    "when this gluon is soft it can not resolve the individual colour charges of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , but only the net charge of the two , which of course is the charge of @xmath136 .",
    "thereby the multiplication of partons in a shower is reduced relative to naive expectations .",
    "as it turns out , evolution in @xmath31 or angle automatically includes this reduction , while one in mass does not .    in the study of fsr ,",
    "e.g.  at lep , three algorithms have been commonly used .",
    "the herwig angular - ordered and pythia mass - ordered ones are conventional parton showers as described above , while the ariadne @xcite @xmath31-ordered one is based on a picture of dipole emissions .",
    "that is , instead of considering @xmath137 one studies @xmath138 .",
    "one aspect of this is that , in addition to the branching parton , ariadne also explicitly includes a `` recoil parton '' needed for overall energy  momentum conservation .",
    "additionally emissions off @xmath56 and @xmath70 are combined in a well - defined manner .",
    "all three approaches have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "as already mentioned , pythia does not inherently include coherence , but has to add that approximately by brute force . both pythia and herwig break lorentz invariance slightly .",
    "the herwig algorithm can not cover the full phase space with it emissions , but has to fill in some `` dead zones '' using higher - order matrix elements .",
    "the ariadne dipole picture does not include @xmath39 branchings in a natural way . and so on .",
    "when all is said and done , it turns out that all three algorithms do a quite decent job of describing lep data @xcite , but typically ariadne does best and herwig worst .",
    "since ariadne uses pythia for hadronization the difference between those two is entirely due to the shower algorithms , while comparisons with herwig also are complicated by significant differences in hadronization .",
    "the structure of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is more complicated than that of fsr , since the nontrivial structure of the incoming hadrons enter the game .",
    "a proton is made up out of three quarks , @xmath139 , plus the gluons that bind them together .",
    "this picture is not static , however : gluons are continuously emitted and absorbed by the quarks , and each gluon may in its turn temporarily split into two gluons or into a @xmath86 pair .",
    "thus a proton is teeming with activity , and much of it in a nonperturbative region where we can not calculate .",
    "we are therefore forced to introduce the concept of a parton density @xmath140 as an empirical distribution , describing the probability to find a parton of species @xmath70 in a hadron , with a fraction @xmath141 of the hadron energy ",

    "the two sets of incoming partons could then be weighted by the cross section for the process under study .",

    "there are ways to speed up this `` forwards evolution '' approach .",

( recall that the original eq .",

    "the approach is now clear .",
    "first a hard scattering is selected , making use of the @xmath43-evolved parton densities .",
    "then , with the hard process as upper maximum scale , a succession of isr branchings are reconstructed at lower and lower @xmath43 scales , going `` backwards in time '' towards the early low - virtuality initiators of the cascades .",
    "again some cutoff needs to be introduced when the nonperturbative regime is reached .",
    "unfortunately the story does not end there .",
    "for fsr we discussed the need to take into account coherence effects and the possibility to use different variables .",
    "such issues exist here as well , but also additional ones .",
    "for instance , evolution need not be strictly ordered in @xmath43 .",
    "( eq .  ( [ eq : ptkin ] ) only gives you @xmath152 , not @xmath153 . )",
    "non - ordered chains in some cases can be important .",
    "another issue is that there can be so many partons evolving inside a hadron that they become close - packed , which leads to additional recombinations .",
    "see the lectures of g.  ingelman for further details @xcite .",
    "in summary , isr and fsr share many aspects , but also differ .",
    "the dglap evolution with sudakov factors allows a simple probabilistic framework , where an initial parton undergoes successive branchings . for isr",
    "the branching ( usually ) is in terms of higher and higher spacelike virtualities as the hard scattering approaches , while for fsr the branchings involve lower and lower timelike virtualities as the hard scattering recedes . in fsr",
    "both daughter partons appear on equal footing , in that both can be timelike and branch further . in isr only the daughter parton on its way in to the hard scattering can be spacelike virtual ; its sister will become part of the final state and thus has to be on mass shell , or else be timelike and start an fsr shower of its own . and ,",
    "last but not least , the whole fsr framework is considerably better understood than the isr one .",
    "as we have seen , both matrix elements ( me ) and parton showers ( ps ) have advantages and disadvantages .    to recall , me allow a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath154 , and",
    "thereby offer a controlled approach towards higher precision .",
    "calculations can be done with several ( up to @xmath155 ) partons in the final state , so long as only born - level results are asked for , and it is possible to tailor the phase - space cuts for these partons precisely to the experimental needs .",
    "loop calculations are much more difficult , on the other hand , and the mathematically correct cancellation between real- and virtual - emission graphs in the soft / collinear regions is not physically sensible .",
    "therefore me can not be used to explore the internal structure of a jet , and are difficult to match to hadronization models , which are supposed to take over in the very soft / collinear region .",
    "ps , on the other hand , clearly are approximate and do not come with a guaranteed level of precision for well separated jets .",
    "you can not steer the probabilistic evolution of a shower too much , and therefore the efficiency for obtaining events in a specific region of phase space can be quite low .",
    "on the other hand , ps are universal , so for any new model you only need to provide the basic hard process and then ps will turn that into reasonably realistic multiparton topologies .",
    "the use of sudakov factors ensures a physically sensible behaviour in the soft / collinear regions , and it is also here that the ps formalism is supposed to be as most reliable .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain a good picture of the internal structure of jets , and to provide a good match to hadronization models .    in a nutshell : me are good for well separated jets , ps for the structure inside jets .",
    "clearly the two complement each other , and a marriage is highly desirable .",
    "to do this , without doublecounting or gaps in the phase space coverage , is less trivial , and several alternative approaches have been developed . in the following",
    "we will discuss three main options : merging , vetoed parton showers and mc@nlo , roughly ordered in increasing complexity . which of these to use may well depend on the task at hand .",
    "the aspiration of merging is to cover the whole phase space with a smooth transition from me to ps .",
    "the typical case would be a process where the lowest - order ( lo ) me is known , as well as the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) real - emission one , say of an additional gluon .",
    "the shower should then reproduce @xmath156 starting from a lo topology .",
    "if the shower populates phase space according to @xmath157 this implies that a correction factor @xmath158 need to be applied .    at first glance",
    "this does not apper to make sense : if all we do is get back @xmath159 , then what did we gain ? however , the trick is to recall that the ps formula comes in two parts : the real - emission answer and a sudakov factor that ensures total conservation of probability",
    ". what we have called @xmath157 above should only be the real - emission part of the story .",
    "it is also this one that we know _ will _ agree with @xmath159 in the soft and collinear regions .",
    "actually , with some moderate amount of effort it is often possible to ensure that @xmath158 is of order unity over the whole phase space , and to adjust the showers in the hard region so that the ratio always is below unity , i.e.so that standard monte carlo rejection techniques can be used .",
    "what the sudakov factor then does is introduce some ordering variable @xmath43 , so that the whole phase space is covered starting from `` hard '' emissions and moving to `` softer '' ones . at the end of the day",
    "this leads to a distribution over phase space like @xmath160 that is , we have used the ps choice of evolution variable to provide an exponentiated version of the me answer .",
    "as such it agrees with the me answer in the hard region , where the sudakov factor is close to unity , and with the ps in the soft / collinear regions , where @xmath161 .",
    "the method is especially convenient for resonance decays , such as @xmath82 where it was first introduced @xcite . in that case",
    "there is an added bonus : the full nlo answer , with virtual corrections included , is known to be @xmath162 .",
    "so it is trivial to use the procedure above and rescale everything by @xmath163 to obtain a complete nlo answer .",
    "note that the difference between using @xmath164 or @xmath165 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wme ] ) only gives a difference to @xmath166 , i.e. to nnlo .",
    "in pythia this approach is used for essentially all resonance decays in the standard model and minimal supersymmetric extensions thereof : @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , ",
    "it is also used in isr to describe @xmath172 @xcite , but here the nlo corrections are more tricky , so the cross section remains as provided by the lo number .",
    "merging is also used for several processes in herwig , such as @xmath90 , @xmath167 and @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "a special problem here is that the angular - ordered algorithms , both for fsr and for isr , leave some `` dead zones '' of hard emissions that are kinematically forbidden for the shower to populate .",
    "it is therefore necessary to start directly from higher - order matrix elements in these regions .",
    "a consistent treatment still allows a smooth joining across the boundary .",
    "in some sense vetoed parton showers is an extension of the merging approach above .",
    "the objective is still to combine the real - emission behaviour of me with the emission - ordering - variable - dependent sudakov factors of ps .",
    "while the merging approach only works for combining the lo and nlo expressions , however , the vetoed parton showers offer a generic approach for combining several different orders .",
    "therefore it is likely to be a standard tool for many studies in the future .    to understand how the algorithm works ,",
    "consider a lowest - order process such as @xmath173 .",
    "for each higher order one additional jet would be added to the final state , so long as only real - emission graphs are considered : in first order e.g.@xmath174 , in second order e.g.@xmath175 , and so on .",
    "call these ( differential ) cross sections @xmath85 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ,  .",
    "it should then come as no surprise that each @xmath178 , @xmath179 , contains soft and collinear divergences .",
    "we therefore need to impose some set of me phase - space cuts , e.g. on invariant masses of parton pairs , or on parton energies and angular separation between them . when these cuts are varied , so that e.g. the mass or energy thresholds are lowered towards zero , all of these @xmath178 , @xmath179 , increase without bounds .",
    "however , in the me approach without virtual corrections there is no `` detailed balance '' , wherein the addition of cross section to @xmath180 is compensated by a depletion of @xmath178 .",
    "that is , if you have an event with @xmath25 jets at some resolution scale , and a lowering of the minimal jet energy reveals the presence of one additional jet , then you should reclassify the event from being @xmath25-jet to being @xmath181-jet .",
    "add one , subtract one , with no net change in @xmath182 .",
    "so the trick is to use the sudakovs of showers to ensure this detailed balance . of course , in a complete description the cancellation between real and virtual corrections is not completely exact but leaves a finite net contribution , which is not predicted in this approach .    a few alternative algorithms exist along these lines .",
    "all share the three first steps as follows @xcite : + 1 ) pick a hard process within the me - cuts - allowed phase - space region , in proportions provided by the me integrated over the respective allowed region , @xmath183 .",
    "use for this purpose a fix @xmath184 larger than the @xmath154 values that will be used below .",
    "+ 2 ) reconstruct an imagined shower history that describes how the event could have evolved from the lowest - order process to the actual final state .",
    "that provides an ordering of emissions by whatever shower - evolution variable is intended .",
    "+ 3 ) the `` best - bet '' choice of @xmath154 scale in showers is known to be the squared transverse momentum of the respective branching .",
    "therefore a factor @xmath185 , provides the probability that the event should be retained .    now the algorithms part way . in the ckkw ",
    "l approach the subsequent steps are : + 4 ) evaluate sudakov factors for all the `` propagator '' lines in the shower history reconstructed in step 2 , i.e. for intermediate partons that split into further partons , and also for the evolution of the final partons down to the me cuts without any further emissions .",
    "this provides an acceptance weight @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the large scale where a parton is produced by a branching and @xmath188 either is the scale at which the parton branches or the me cuts , the case being .",
    "+ 4a ) in the ckkw approach @xcite the sudakovs are evaluated by analytical formulae , which is fast .",
    "+ 4b ) in the l approach @xcite trial showers are used to evaluate sudakovs , which is slower but allows a more precise modelling of kinematics and phase space than offered by the analytic expression .",
    "+ 5 ) now the matrix - element configuration can be evolved further , to provide additional jets below the me cuts used . in order to avoid doublecounting of emissions , any branchings that might occur above the me cuts must be vetoed .",
    "the mlm approach @xcite is rather different . here",
    "the steps instead are : + 4 ) allow a complete parton shower to develop from the selected parton configuration .",
    "+ 5 ) cluster these partons back into a set of jets , e.g. using a cone - jet algorithm , with the same jet - separation criteria as used when the original parton configuration was picked .",
    "+ 6 ) try to match each jet to its nearest original parton .",
    "+ 7 ) accept the event only if the number of clustered jets agrees with the number of original partons , and if each original parton is sensibly matched to its jet .",
    "this would not be the case e.g.  if one parton gave rise to two jets , or two partons to one jet , or an original @xmath70 quark migrated outside of the clustered jet .",
    "+ the point of the mlm approach is that the probability of _ not _ generating any additional fatal jet activity during the shower evolution is provided by the sudakovs used in the step 4.      mc@nlo @xcite in some respects is the most ambitious approach : it aims to get not only real but also virtual contributions correctly included , so that cross sections are accurate to nlo , and that nlo results are obtained for all observables when formally expanded in powers of @xmath154 .",
    "thus hard emissions should again be generated according to me , while soft and collinear ones should fall within the ps regime .",
    "in simplified terms , the scheme works as follows : + 1 ) calculate the nlo me corrections to an @xmath49-body process , including @xmath189-body real corrections and @xmath49-body virtual ones .",
    "+ 2 ) calculate analytically how a first branching in a shower starting from a @xmath49-body topology would populate @xmath189-body phase space , excluding the sudakov factor .",
    "+ 3 ) subtract the shower expression from the @xmath189 me one to obtain the `` true '' @xmath189 events , and consider the rest as belonging to the @xmath49-body class .",

    "this is solved by having a small fraction of events with negative weights .    in summary",
    ", mc@nlo is superiour in that it does provide the total cross section for a process to nlo accuracy , and so is essential for a set of precision tests .",
    "the real - emission @xmath189-body part is the same as used for merging , however , so for normalized event shapes the merging approach is as valid .",
    "( any differences are of higher order . ) finally , if multijet topologies need to be studied , where several orders may contribute , vetoed showers are more appropriate .",
    "each tool to its task .",
    "the cross section for @xmath33 qcd parton processes is dominated by @xmath113-channel gluon exchange , as we already mentioned , and thus diverges like @xmath197 for @xmath20 . introduce a lower cut @xmath198 and integrate the interaction cross section above this , properly convoluted with parton densities . at lhc energies this @xmath199 reaches around 100  mb for @xmath200  gev , and 1000  mb at around 2  gev . since each interaction gives two jets to lowest order",
    ", the jet cross section is twice as big .",
    "this should be compared with an expected _ total _ cross section of the order of 100  mb .",
    "( qcd is a confining theory and thus provides a finite total cross section , unlike qed , where infinitely small scattering angles are allowed at infinitely large distances . ) in addition , at least a third of the total cross section is related to elastic scattering @xmath201 and low - mass diffractive states @xmath202 that could not contain jets .",
    "so can it really make sense that @xmath203 ? yes , it can !",
    "the point is that each incoming hadron is a bunch of partons .",
    "you can have several ( more or less ) independent parton ",
    "parton interactions when these two bunches pass through each other .",
    "and the point is that an event with @xmath49 interactions above @xmath198 counts once for the total cross section but once _ for each interaction _ when the interaction rate is calculated .",
    "that is , @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the cross section for events with @xmath49 interactions .",
    "thus @xmath206 is equivalent to @xmath207 , that each event on the average contains more than one interaction .",
    "furthermore , if interactions really do occur independently when two hadron pass by each other , then one would expect a poissonian distribution , @xmath208 , so that several interactions could occur occasionally also when @xmath209 , e.g. for a larger @xmath198 cut .",
    "momentum conservation ensures that interactions never are truly independent , and also other effects enter ( see below ) , but the poissonian ansatz is still a useful starting point .",
    "multiple interactions ( mi ) can only be half the solution , however . the divergence for @xmath210 would seem to imply an infinite average number of interactions .",
    "but what one should realize is that , in order to calculate the @xmath211 matrix elements within standard perturbation theory , it has to be assumed that free quark and gluon states exist at negative and positive infinity .",
    "that is , the confinement of colour into hadrons of finite size has not been taken into account .",
    "so obviously perturbation theory has to have broken down by @xmath212 the nature of the breakdown is also easy to understand : a small-@xmath31 gluon , to be exchanged between the two incoming hadrons , has a large transverse wavelength and thus almost the same phase across the extent of each hadron .",
    "the contributions from all the colour charges in a hadron thus add coherently , and that means that they add to zero since the hadron is a colour singlet .",
    "what is then the typical scale of such colour screening effects , i.e.  at what @xmath31 has the interaction rate dropped to @xmath213half of what it would have been if the quarks and gluons of a proton had all been free to interact fully independently ? that ought to be related to the typical separation distance between a given colour and its opposite anticolour .",
    "when a proton contains many partons this characteristic screening distance can well be much smaller than the proton radius .",
    "empirically we need to introduce a @xmath198 scale of the order of 2  gev to describe tevatron data , i.e. of the order of 0.1  fm separation .",
    "it is not meaningful to take this number too seriously without a detailed model of the space ",
    "time structure of a hadron , however .",
    "the 2  gev number is very indirect and does not really tell exactly how the dampening occurs .",
    "one can use a simple recipe , with a step - function cut at this scale , or a physically more reasonable dampening by a factor @xmath214 , plus a corresponding shift of the @xmath154 argument , @xmath215 with @xmath216 a dampening scale that also lands at around 2  gev .",
    "this translates into a typical number of 23 interactions per event at the tevatron and 45 at lhc . for events with jets or other hard processes",
    "the average number is likely to be higher .",
    "the first studies of complete events based on perturbatively generated mi @xcite started out from a mimimally simple model : + 1 ) use a sharp @xmath198 cut as the key tunable parameter .",
    "+ 2 ) only address inelastic nondiffractive events , i.e.  with @xmath217 , so that the average number of interactions per such events is @xmath218 .",
    "+ 3 ) to first approximation this gives a poissonian distribution in the number of interactions per event , with a fraction @xmath219 of purely low-@xmath31 interactions .",
    "+ 4 ) the interactions are generated in an ordered sequence of decreasing @xmath31 values : @xmath220 .",
    "this is possible with the standard sudakov kind of trick : @xmath221 ~,\\ ] ] with a starting @xmath222 .",
    "+ 5 ) the ordering of emissions allows parton densities to be rescaled in @xmath141 after each interaction , so that energy ",
    "momentum is not violated .",
    "thereby the actual distribution of the number of interactions becomes narrower than poissonian , since the rate of a further interaction is reduced if previous ones already took away energy .",
    "+ 6 ) for technical reasons the model was simplified after the first interaction , so that there only @xmath98 or @xmath99 outgoing pairs were allowed , and no showers were added to these additional @xmath33 interactions . + already this simple pythia - based model is able to `` explain '' a large set of experimental data .    some additional features were then included in a more sophisticated variant .",
    "+ 1 ) use the smooth turnoff of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smoothmi ] ) all the way down to @xmath223 .",
    "then an event has to contain at least one interaction to be an event at all , i.e.  @xmath216 has to be selected sufficiently small that @xmath224 .",
    "+ 2 ) hadrons are extended , and therefore partons are distributed in ( transverse ) coordinates . to allow a flexible parametrization and yet have an easy - to - work - with expression , a double gaussian @xmath225 is used , where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are tunable parameters .",
    "+ 3 ) the matter overlap during a collision , calculated by @xmath228 directly determines the average activity in events at different impact parameter @xmath70 : @xmath229 .",
    "that is , central collisions tend to have more activity , peripheral less , but of course properly normalized so that the @xmath70-integrated interaction cross section agrees with standard perturbation theory ( modulo the already - discussed dampening at small @xmath31 ) . thereby the @xmath230 distribution becomes broader than a poissonian .",
    "+ as before , several simplifications are necessary .",
    "+ this is the scenario that has been used in many of the experimental studies over the years .    more recently a number of improvements have been included @xcite .",
    "+ 1 ) the introduction of junction fragmentation , wherein the confinement field between the three quarks in a baryon is described as a y - shaped topology , now allows the handling of topologies where several valence quarks are kicked out , thus allowing arbitrary flavours and showering in all interactions in an event .",
    "+ 2 ) parton densities are not only rescaled for energy  momentum conservation , but also to take into account the number of remaining valence quarks , or that sea quarks have to occur in @xmath99 pairs .",
    "+ 3 ) the introduction of @xmath31-ordered showers allows the selection of new isr branchings and new interactions to be interleaved in one common sequence of falling @xmath31 values . thereby the competition between these two components , which both remove energy from the incoming beams ,",
    "is modelled more realistically .",
    "fsr is not yet interleaved , but also does not compete for beam energy .",
    "+ this scenario is not yet as well studied experimentally .",
    "the traditional herwig soft underlying event ( sue ) approach to this issue has its origin in the ua5 monte carlo . in it",
    "a number of clusters are distributed almost independently in rapidity and transverse momentum , but shifted so that energy ",
    "momentum is conserved , and the clusters then decay isotropically .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of clusters and their @xmath231 and @xmath31 spectra are tuned to give the observed inclusive hadron spectra .",
    "no jets are produced in this approach .",
    "the jimmy @xcite program is an add - on to herwig .",
    "it replaces the sue model with a mi - based one more similar to the pythia ones above , e.g.  with an impact - parameter - based picture for the multiple - interactions rate .",
    "technical differences exist , e.g.   jimmy interactions are not picked to be @xmath31-ordered and thus energy ",
    "momentum issues are handled differently .",
    "the dpmjet / dtujet / phojet family of programs @xcite come from the `` historical '' tradition of soft physics , wherein multiple @xmath232 `` pomeron '' exchanges fill a role somewhat similar to the hard mi above .",
    "jet physics was originally not included , but later both hard and soft interactions have been allowed .",
    "one strong point is that this framework also allows diffractive events to be included as part of the same basic machinery .",
    "how do we know that mi exist ?",
    "the key problem is that it is not possible to identify jets coming from @xmath233  gev partons .",
    "therefore we either have to use indirect signals for the presence of interactions at this scale or we have to content ourselves with studying the small fraction of events where two interactions occur at visibly large @xmath31 values .",
    "an example of the former is the total charged multiplicity distribution in high - energy @xmath2 collision .",
    "this distribution is very broad , and is even getting broader with increasing energy , meaured in terms of the width over the average , @xmath234 .",
    "by contrast , recall that for a poissonian this quantity scales like @xmath235 and thus is getting narrower . simple models , with at most one interaction and with a fragmentation framework in agreement with lep data , can not explain this : they are way to narrow , and have the wrong energy behaviour .",
    "if mi are included the additional variability in the number of interactions per event offers the missing piece @xcite .",
    "the variable - impact - parameter improves the description further .",
    "another related example is forward ",
    "backward correlations .",
    "consider the charged multiplicity @xmath236 and @xmath237 in a forward and a backward rapidity bin , each of width one unit , separated by a central rapidity gap of size @xmath238 .",
    "it is not unnatural that @xmath236 and @xmath237 are somewhat correlated in two - jet events , and for small @xmath238 one may also be sensitive to the tails of jets . but",
    "the correlation coefficient , although falling with @xmath238 , still is appreciable even out to @xmath239 , and here again traditional one - interaction models come nowhere near . in a mi scenario",
    "each interaction provides additional particle production over a large rapidity range , and this additional number - of - mi variability leads to good agreement with data .",
    "direct evidence comes from the study of four - jet events .",
    "these can be caused by two separate interactions , but also by a single one where higher orders ( call it me or ps ) has allowed two additional branchings in a basic two - jet topology .",
    "fortunately the kinematics should be different .",
    "assume the four jets are ordered in @xmath31 , @xmath240 .",
    "if coming from two separate interactions the jets should pair up into two separately balancing sets , @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "if an azimuthal angle @xmath243 is introduced between the two jet axes this also should be flat if the interactions are uncorrelated . by contast",
    "the higher - order graph offers no reason why the jets should occur in balanced pairs , and the @xmath243 distribution ought to be peaked at small values , corresponding to the familiar collinear singularity .",
    "the first to observe an mi signal this way was the afs collaboration @xcite at isr ( @xmath244 at 62 gev ) , but with large uncertainties .",
    "a more convincing study was made by cdf @xcite , who obtained a clear signal in a sample with three jets plus a photon .",
    "in fact the deduced rate was almost a factor of three higher than naive expectations , but quite in agreement with the impact - parameter - dependent picture , wherein correlations of this kind are enhanced .",
    "a topic that has quite extensively studied in cdf is that of the jet pedestal @xcite , i.e.  the increased activity seen in events with a jet , even away from the jet itself , and away from the recoiling jet that should be there .",
    "some effects come from the showering activity , i.e.  the presence of additional softer jets , but much of it rather finds its explanation in mi , as a kind of `` trigger bias '' effect , as follows .",
    "( 1 ) central collisions tend to produce many interactions , peripheral ones few .",
    "( 2 ) if an event has @xmath49 interactions there are @xmath49 chances that one of them is hard .",
    "combine the two and one concludes that events with hard jets are biased towards central collisions and many additional interactions . the rise of the pedestal with triggger - jet energy saturates once @xmath245 , however , because by then events are already maximally biased towards small impact parameter . and",
    "this is indeed what is observed in the data : a rapid rise of the pedestal up to @xmath246  gev , and then a slower increase that is mainly explained by showering contributions .    in more detailed studies of this kind of pedestal effects",
    "there are also some indications of a jet substructure in the pedestal , i.e.that indeed the pedestal is associated with the production of additional ( soft ) jet pairs .    in spite of many qualitative successes , and even some quantitative ones",
    ", one should not be lead to believe that all is understood .",
    "possibly the most troublesome issue is how colours are hooked up between all the outgoing partons that come from several different interactions .",
    "a first , already difficult , question is how colours are correlated between all the partons that are taken out from an incoming hadron .",
    "these colours are then mixed up by the respective scattering , in principle ( approximately ) calculable .",
    "but , finally , all the outgoing partons will radiate further and overlap with each other on the way out , and how much that may mess up colours is an open question .",
    "a sensitive quantity is @xmath247 , i.e.  how the average transverse momentum of charged particles varies as a function of their multiplicity .",
    "if interactions are uncorrelated in colour this curve tends to be flat : each further interaction adds about as much @xmath31 as @xmath248 .",
    "if colours somehow would rearrange themselves , so that the confinement colour fields would not have to run criss - cross in the event , then the multiplicity would not rise as fast for each further interaction , and so a positive slope would result .",
    "the embarrassing part is that the cdf tunes tend to come up with values that are about 90% on the way to being maximally rearranged @xcite , which is way more than one would have guessed .",
    "obviously further modelling and tests are necessary here @xcite .",
    "another issue is whether the @xmath216 regularization scale should be energy - dependent . in olden days",
    "there was no need for this , but it became necessary when hera data showed that parton densities rise faster at small @xmath141 values than had commonly been assumed .",
    "this means that the partons become more close - packed and the colour screening increases faster with increasing collision energy . therefore an energy - dependent @xmath216 is not unreasonable , but also",
    "can not be predicted .",
    "currently the default pythia ansatz is @xmath249 , i.e  a predicted @xmath250  gev at 14 tev .",
    "this gives a minimum - bias multiplicity of about 7 per unit of rapidity in the central region , and a pedestal under jet events of around 30 charged particles per unit @xcite .",
    "however , these numbers are model- and parameter - dependent .",
    "phojet predicts about half as big a pedestal , and typical jimmy tunes about 50% more , a priori leaving a big range of uncertainty to be resolved once lhc runs begin .",
    "the physics mechanisms discussed so far are mainly being played out on the partonic level , while experimentalists observe hadrons . in between",
    "exists the very important hadronization phase , where all the outgoing partons end up confined inside hadrons of a typical 1 gev mass scale .",
    "this phase can not ( so far ? ) be described from first principles , but has to involve some modelling .",
    "the main approaches in use today are string fragmentation and cluster fragmentation .",
    "these are described in the lectures of g.  ingelman @xcite , so this section will be very brief , only with a few comments .",
    "hadronization models start from some ideologically motivated principles , but then have to add `` cookbook recipes '' with free parameters to arrive at a complete picture of all the nitty gritty details .",
    "this should come as no surprise , given that there are hundereds of known hadron species to take into account , each with its mass , width , wavefunction , couplings , decay patterns and other properties that could influence the structure of the observable hadronic state , and with many of those properties being poorly or not at all known , either from theory ( lattice qcd ) or from experiment . in that sense , it is sometimes more surprising that models can work as well as they do than that they fail to describe everything .",
    "the simpler initial state at an @xmath251 collider , such as lep , implies that this is the logical place to tune the hadronization framework to data @xcite , and thereafter those tunes can be applied to other studies .",
    "one such is the internal structure of jets in hadron collider , where the pattern in many respects is surprisingly well described .    on the other hand , at the hera @xmath1 collider it has been observed that the relative amount of strange - particle production is only @xmath252 of that at lep , and of ( anti)baryons only @xmath253 .",
    "this has no simple explanation within the string fragmentation model , so it acts as a useful reminder that we still do not know as much as we should . also other examples could be provided",
    "in these lectures we have followed the flow of generators roughly `` inwards out '' , i.e. from short - distance processes to long - distance ones . at the core",
    "lies the hard process , described by matrix elements .",
    "it is surrounded by initial- and final - state showers , that should be properly matched to the hard process .",
    "multiple parton ",
    "parton interactions can occur , and the colour flow is tied up with the structure of beam remnants . at longer timescales",
    "the partons turn into hadrons , many of which are unstable and decay further .",
    "this basic pattern is likely to remain in the future , but many aspects will change .",
    "one such aspect , that stands a bit apart , is that of languages .",
    "the traditional event generators , like pythia and herwig , have been developed in fortran  up until the end of the lep era this was the main language in high - energy physics .",
    "but now the experimental community has largely switched to c++ and decisions have been taken e.g.at cern to discontinue fortran altogether .",
    "the older generators are still being used , hidden under c++ wrappers , but this can only be a temporary solution , for several reasons .",
    "one is that younger experimentalists often need to look into the code of generators and tailor some parts to specific needs of theirs , and if then the code is in an unknown language this will not work .",
    "another is that theory students who apply for non - academic positions are much better off if their resums say `` expert on object - oriented programming '' rather than `` fortran fan '' .",
    "a conversion program thus has begun on many fronts .",
    "sherpa , as the youngest of the general - purpose generators , was conceived from the onset as a c++ package and thus is some steps ahead of the other programs in this respect .",
    "@xcite is a complete reimplementation of the herwig , as is pythia  8 of the current pythia  6 .",
    "both conversions have taken longer than originally hoped , but progress is being made and first versions exist .",
    "thepeg @xcite is a generic toolkit for event generators , used by herwig++ and the upcoming new ariadne .",
    "* faster , better and more user - friendly general - purpose matrix - element generators with an improved sampling of phase space .",
    "* new ready - made libraries of physics processes , in particular with full nlo corrections included .",
    "* more precise parton showers .",
    "* better matching between matrix elements and parton showers . *",
    "improved models for minimum - bias physics and underlying events .",
    "* some upgrades of hadronization models and decay descriptions .",
    "in general one would say that generators are getting better all the time , but at the same time the experimental demands are also getting higher , so it is a tight race . however , given that typical hadronic final states at lhc will contain hundreds of particles and quite complex patterns buried in that , it is difficult to see that there are any alternatives .    as the same time",
    "as you need to use generators , you should remain critical and be on the lookout for bugs and bad modelling .",
    "bjorken already many years ago worried about the passive attitude many experimentalists have towards the output of generators ; they `` carry the authority of data itself .",
    "they look like data and feel like data , and if one is not careful they are accepted as if they were data . ''",
