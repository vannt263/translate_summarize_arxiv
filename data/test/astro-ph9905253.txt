    "several non - thermal processes have recently been detected in clusters of galaxies from the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation in excess of the thermal expectation to the soft x - rays detected by rosat and bepposax and again to hard x - ray excesses and radio radiation .",
    "for the coma cluster , by far the best studied cluster , a complete investigation of the soft excess can be found in ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ; bowyer , lampton & lieu 1996 ; fabian 1996 ; mittaz , lieu & lockman 1998 , sarazin & lieu 1998 ) while the detection of the hard excess above 20 kev is reported in ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1998 ) . a recent review of the diffuse radio emission can be found in ( feretti et al .",
    "some clusters show only emission in some region of frequency and not in others .",
    "also for this reason coma gives the best possibility to make multiwavelengths studies .",
    "a review of the current status of the multifrequency observations of coma and viable models for the non thermal radiation can be found in ( ensslin et al .",
    "1998 ) . as stressed by fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , if the hard x - ray excess is due to inverse compton scattering ( ics ) off the photons of the microwave background , then the combined radio and hard x - ray observations of coma imply a small value for the average intracluster magnetic field , of order @xmath1 .",
    "such a small value of the field requires large energy densities in electrons , and , as pointed out in ( lieu et al .",
    "1999 ) , cr energy densities comparable with the equipartition value are required .",
    "this conclusion is only weakly dependent on the specific model ( primary or secondary ) for the production of the electrons responsable for the radiation .",
    "in fact the need for large cr energy densities was recently confirmed by blasi & colafrancesco ( 1999 ) , in the context of the secondary electron model .",
    "lieu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also correctly pointed out that the assumption of equipartition is limited by the production of gamma rays through neutral pion decay , but this flux was claimed to be much smaller than the egret sensitivity , falling below the egret upper limit already imposed on the gamma ray flux from the coma and virgo clusters ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we calculate here the flux of gamma rays from the coma and virgo clusters in the assumption of equipartition of crs with the thermal energy in the cluster , for two different models of the cr injection in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and for different injection spectra and find that in some cases the gamma ray flux is in excess of the egret limit .",
    "moreover , we find that for injection cr spectra flatter than @xmath0 ( for @xmath2 ) some currently operating experiments like stacee , hegra and whipple could detect the gamma ray signal from coma and virgo in the tev range , provided the crs are in equipartition , or put strong constraints on this condition if no signal is detected .    the paper is planned as follows : in section [ gamma ] we outline the calculations of the gamma ray fluxes from clusters ; in section [ cr ] we describe the models of cr propagation that we used and in section [ results ] we describe our results for the coma and virgo clusters .",
    "in this section we calculate the flux of gamma rays due to the decay of neutral pions produced in cr collisions in the icm .",
    "this channel provides the dominant contribution to gamma rays above @xmath3 mev .",
    "independent of the sources that provide the crs in clusters , the equilibrium cr distribution is some function @xmath4 of the proton energy @xmath5 and of the position in the cluster . for simplicity",
    "we assume the cluster to be spherically symmetric , so that the distance @xmath6 from the center is the only space coordinate .",
    "we determine @xmath7 for different injection models in the next section .",
    "the rate of production of gamma rays with energy @xmath8 per unit volume at distance @xmath6 from the cluster center is given by blasi & colafrancesco ( 1999 ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pion energy , @xmath11 is the minimum pion energy needed to generate a gamma ray photon with energy @xmath8 and @xmath12 is some maximum energy in the injected cr spectrum ( our calculations do not depend on the value of @xmath12 ) . here",
    "@xmath13 is the density of thermal gas at distance @xmath6 from the cluster center . for coma we model the gas density through a king profile : @xmath14^{-3\\beta/2 } ,",

    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) represents the cross section for the production of neutral pions with energy @xmath10 in a cr collision at energy @xmath5 in the laboratory frame . determining this function is complicate in the low energy regime where data is scarse .",
    "a possible approach was proposed by dermer ( 1986 ) and recently reviewed by moskalenko & strong ( 1998 ) and is based on the isobar model .",
    "this approach is valid for cr collisions at @xmath22 gev and consists in treating the pion production as a process mediated by the generation and decay of the resonance @xmath23 in the @xmath24 interaction .",
    "we refer to the papers by dermer ( 1986 ) and moskalenko & strong ( 1998 ) for the detailed expressions for @xmath21 . for @xmath25",
    "gev the scaling approach is an excellent approximation of the function @xmath21 . in this regime",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath24 collisions can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the so called scaling function . in the scaling regime ,",
    "the function @xmath21 coincides with the differential cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) .    once the gamma ray emissivity is known from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) , the flux of gamma rays with energy @xmath8 is simply given by volume integration @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance to the cluster and @xmath32 is the cluster radius .",
    "in fact @xmath32 here plays the role of the size of the region where the non thermal processes are observed .",
    "we adopt here the value suggested from radio observations in coma , @xmath33 mpc .",
    "this is however a very conservative case and it seems likely that magnetic fields extend to larger regions .",
    "in fact in ensslin , wang , nath & biermann ( 1998a ) the injection of energy due to formation of black holes in the coma cluster was estimated and compared with the thermal energy in a region of @xmath34 mpc ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "for the coma cluster we shall also consider this less conservative case .",
    "several sources of crs in clusters of galaxies were discussed by berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin ( 1997 ) and it was argued that the known sources ( agns , radiogalaxies , accretion shocks ) are not able to provide crs in equipartition with the thermal gas .",
    "an intense and short period of powerful emission from the cluster sources was also considered , consistently with the observed iron abundance in the cluster , with the same conclusion . since",
    "recent observations of non thermal radiation from clusters seem to suggest that equipartition is indeed required , we do not make here any assumption on the type of sources and instead we assume equipartition and analyze the observational consequences of this assumption .    the equipartition energy can be easily estimated from the total thermal energy of the gas , assuming it has a temperature @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath13 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : den_coma ] ) for the coma cluster and by eq .",
    "( [ eq : den_virgo ] ) for the virgo cluster .",
    "the temperature adopted for coma is @xmath38 k while for virgo we used @xmath39 k ( nulsen & bohringer 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , from the previous equation we obtain @xmath40 erg for coma and @xmath41 erg for virgo .",
    "these numbers could underestimate the total thermal energy due to the contribution of gas out of the @xmath42 mpc region .",
    "in fact ensslin et al . ( 1998a ) estimated for the coma cluster that the thermal energy in a region of @xmath34 mpc is @xmath43 erg , a factor @xmath44 larger than estimated above .",
    "they also calculate the expected injection of total ( thermal plus non thermal ) energy due to black hole formation in the cluster , and find in the same region a similar number .",
    "since not only the energy budget in crs is not known , but also their spatial distribution is very poorly constrained , we consider here two extreme scenarios for the injection of crs and we calculate the equilibrium cr distribution from the transport equation .    _",
    "i ) point source _    as argued by berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin ( 1997 ) , colafrancesco & blasi ( 1998 ) and ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) it is likely that for most of the cluster s age the main contributors to crs in clusters are located in the cluster core .",
    "this is the case if a radiogalaxy or more generally a powerful active galaxy or a shock produced by merging is the source/ accelerator of crs .",
    "there is an additional argument that plays in favor of a source mainly concentrated in the center of the cluster : if the average spatial distribution of the galaxies in a cluster is not a strong function of time , then it is reasonable to assume that at all times , as today , the distribution of the sources is peaked around the cluster center . according with ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) ( see also references therein ) the spatial distribution of galaxies in coma is well represented by a king - like profile @xmath45^{-0.8}$ ] , with @xmath46 kpc , appreciably smaller that the cluster core , so that a source concentrated in the center seems a reasonable assumption .",
    "therefore we assume that the source can be modelled as a point source with a rate of injection of crs given by a power law in momentum @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the cr momentum and the normalization constant is determined by energy integration @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the kinetic energy and @xmath51 is the cr luminosity at injection , forced here to be correspondent to the establishment of equipartition in the cluster .",
    "we estimate it averaging the equipartition energy on the age of the cluster : @xmath52 .",
    "the transport equation that gives the distribution of crs at distance @xmath6 from the source and after a time @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 , can be written in the form @xmath55 = q(e_p)\\delta ( \\vec { r } ) , \\label{eq : transport}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath57 is the rate of energy losses .",
    "as shown in ( berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin 1997 , colafrancesco & blasi 1998 , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) for cr protons the energy losses can be neglected and eq .",
    "( [ eq : transport ] ) has the simple solution ( blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] is the maximum distance that on average particles with energy @xmath5 could diffuse away from the source in the time @xmath53 .",
    "we are interested here in the case @xmath60 ( @xmath61 here is the age of the cluster , taken as comparable with the age of the universe ) .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath62 gives an estimate of the maximum energy @xmath63 for which crs can be considered confined in the cluster volume for all the age of the cluster .",
    "for reasonable choices of the diffusion coefficient the confined crs provide the main contribution to the energy budget of crs in clusters and also to the integral flux of gamma rays above @xmath3 mev , calculated as explained in the previous section . as far as gamma rays produced by interactions of confined crs",
    "are concerned the flux of gamma radiation is independent on the choice of the diffusion coefficient , as pointed out by berezinsky , blasi & ptuskin ( 1997 ) , and the spectrum of gamma rays simply reflects the spectrum of the parent protons ( for @xmath64 gev ) .",
    "rigorously this is true only for spatially constant intracluster gas density , while a density profile , as assumed here , results in a weak dependence of the gamma ray spectrum on the diffusion details .",
    "therefore , for the sake of completeness we adopt here a specific choice of the diffusion coefficient : we assume that the fluctuations in the magnetic field in the cluster are well represented by a kolmogorov power spectrum @xmath65 and we calculate the diffusion coefficient according with the procedure outlined by colafrancesco & blasi ( 1998 ) , which gives @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the value of the magnetic field in @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the scale of the largest eddy in the power spectrum of the magnetic field .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) and ( [ eq : sol ] ) completely define the distribution of cosmic rays in the cluster in the case of a point source .    _",
    "i ) spatially homogeneous injection _    as pointed out above , the budget of crs in clusters is largely dominated by confined crs , so that in the case of spatially homogeneous injection the distribution of crs can be easily written in the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the injection volume , @xmath72 is the total energy injected in the cluster in the form of crs and @xmath73 is calculated by the normalization condition @xmath74 where @xmath75 is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : equi ] ) . clearly eq .",
    "( [ eq : homo ] ) does not describe well the cr distribution very close to the cluster boundary .",
    "moreover at sufficiently high energy , where crs are not confined in the cluster volume the cr spectrum suffers a steepening to @xmath76 , with @xmath77 for a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we study the observational consequences of the assumption of equipartition between crs and thermal gas in clusters of galaxies .",
    "in particular we calculated the flux of gamma radiation from the coma and virgo clusters when equipartition is assumed .",
    "this assumption seems to be required if a ics origin is accepted for the hard and soft x - ray excess and for the euv flux from coma and other clusters of galaxies ( note however that alternative possibilities can be proposed ) . in particular , according to lieu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , _ in order to account for the observed cluster soft excess flux from coma , equipartition between crs and gas is unavoidable_. in ( berezinsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) different possible models of cr injection in clusters were considered , including active galaxies , accretion shocks during the formation of the cluster and a possible bright phase in the past of the cluster galaxies , but none of these sources could account for cr energy densities larger that @xmath78 of the equipartition value , if a conversion efficiency of @xmath79 was assumed for the injection of non thermal energy from the total energy of the sources .    on the other hand ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) compared the thermal energy in a @xmath80 mpc region with the energy injected during the formation of massive black holes in the coma cluster .",
    "the total energy ( thermal plus non thermal ) released in this process was estimated to be comparable with the thermal energy in the cluster ( if an efficiency factor is assumed , the non thermal energy may be smaller than the equipartition value ) .",
    "since our knowledge of the sources of crs in clusters is still very poor , we decided to adopt here a phenomenological approach and try to find observational tests or consequences of our assumptions .",
    "the most striking consequence of a large abundance of crs in a cluster is the production of gamma rays through the generation and decay of neutral pions in @xmath24 interactions . since the egret instrument put an upper limit on the flux of gamma radiation above @xmath3 mev from coma and virgo ( @xmath81 ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1996 ) ) , we can use this constraint to test the equipartition assumption .",
    "our calculations were carried out for two extreme models of injection of crs in the cluster , namely a point source in the cluster core and a spatially homogeneous injection in the cluster volume . in the case of a point source",
    ", we can think of it as an _ effective source _ , in the sense that on average a dominant source or a set of sources are located at the cluster center . in this sense",
    "it is not needed that the same source remains active for all the age of the cluster .",
    "the energy spectrum of the injected crs was assumed to be a power law in momentum , as expected for a shock acceleration spectrum , and two extreme values of the power index were studied , namely @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which encompass the whole range of power indexes expected from shock acceleration ( other models of acceleration also give power laws in the same range of parameters ) .    since the gamma ray spectra depend ( although very weakly ) on the choice of the diffusion coefficient",
    ", we made here a specific choice , modelling the spectrum of fluctuations of the field by a kolmogorov spectrum and calculating the diffusion coefficient according with eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) . in the numerical calculations we used @xmath84 and @xmath85 kpc ( if for instance we use @xmath86 the results on the integral fluxes change only by @xmath79 , confirming the weak dependence on the diffusion details mainly due to the use of a specific gas density profile ) .      due to the appearence of the flat region at low gamma ray energy , typical of spectra from pion decay ,",
    "there is not a strong dependence of the integral flux on @xmath88 . in some cases",
    "considered the gamma ray flux exceeds the egret upper limit .",
    "as it could be expected , the gamma ray flux is larger for the case of a point source in the cluster center and the egret limit is exceeded by a factor @xmath89 for coma and by a factor @xmath90 for virgo . in the case of homogeneous injection the gamma ray fluxes are slightly smaller than the egret upper limit both for coma and virgo .",
    "these results are more impressive when the condition of equipartition is imposed on a larger region of size @xmath34 mpc ( ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) ) : for a single source in the cluster center the egret limit is exceeded by @xmath90 for @xmath82 and by @xmath91 for @xmath83 .",
    "for an homogeneous injection the predicted fluxes are in excess of the egret limit by @xmath92 for @xmath82 and by @xmath44 for @xmath83 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress again that this result is practically independent on the specific choice of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in fact , the crs relevant for the production of gamma rays in the energy range @xmath93 gev are certainly confined in the cluster for any reasonable choice of the diffusion coefficient , and the spectrum in this region is independent on this choice .",
    "the effects of the diffusion may appear only at higher energy where gamma rays are produced by crs not confined in the cluster .",
    "as shown in ( berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 ) this produces a steepening of the gamma ray spectrum to a power law with index @xmath94 ( with @xmath77 in the case of a kolmogorov spectrum of fluctuations ) at energies larger than a _ knee _ energy @xmath95 . at smaller energies",
    "the gamma ray spectrum reproduces the spectrum of the parent crs .",
    "the transition appears at @xmath96^{1/\\eta}$ ] , as obtained from the equation @xmath62 .",
    "actually this was shown in ( berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 ) for the case of a constant intracluster gas density . in the more realistic case considered here , where the gas is modelled by a king or a power law profile ,",
    "the gamma ray spectrum suffers a smooth steepening even for confined crs , but this affects the integral flux above @xmath3 mev only at the level of @xmath79 .",
    "the integral spectra of gamma rays from coma with energy @xmath97 as functions of the energy @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "1a ( for the point source ) and 1b ( for the homogeneous case ) for @xmath87 mpc .",
    "in the same plot we draw the sensitivity limits for several present and planned experiments for gamma ray astronomy .",
    "the solid lines refer to @xmath82 while the dashed lines are obtained for @xmath83 .",
    "the fluxes in the energy region @xmath98 gev are well above the detectability limit of glast , so that there is no doubt that the question of equipartition will be completely answered with the next generation gamma ray satellites . however fig .",
    "1 also shows that the signal from coma could be detectable even in some current experiments , provided @xmath99 . in particular stacee could detect the signal above @xmath100 gev and whipple might detect the signal for @xmath101 gev",
    ". the flux should be detectable by the hegra cerenkov telescope above @xmath102 gev .",
    "a non - detection from these experiments would imply a reduction of the energy density in clusters by about one order of magnitude below equipartition for @xmath82 . for steep spectra",
    "only stacee has a slim chance to detect the signal . in the same energy range the next generation",
    "gamma ray experiments will very likely measure the flux of gamma rays for any value of @xmath88 in the range considered here .    in the case of the virgo cluster and @xmath87 mpc ,",
    "the fluxes are plotted in fig .",
    "2a ( for sources in the center ) and fig .",
    "2b ( for a homogeneous injection ) and conclusions similar to the ones outlined for coma hold .",
    "note that this result is subtantially different from the one obtained in previous calculations . in particular ensslin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reached the conclusion that the fluxes from coma and virgo are _ orders of magnitude too low to be detectable _ in the tev range .",
    "this conclusion was obtained because following dar and shaviv ( 1995 ) the gamma ray spectrum was assumed to reproduce the equilibrium spectrum of crs in the galaxy @xmath103 ( this did not affect appreciably their integral fluxes above 100 mev , which are not very different from the ones obtained here for the homogeneous case ) . however , as shown in ( berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 , colafrancesco & blasi 1998 , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) and confirmed here , the spectrum of gamma rays from @xmath24 collisions in clusters does not reproduce the equilibrium cr spectrum , but the generation spectrum as far as gamma ray photons are produced by interactions of crs confined in the cluster , as it is the case for gamma rays with energy less than @xmath104 tev , for the values of the parameters used here ( though , as pointed out before , a slight steepening is introduced by the gas density profile ) .",
    "therefore the gamma ray spectrum from crs in clusters is approximately @xmath105 up to some maximum energy @xmath95 where crs begin to be no longer confined in the cluster volume . as a consequence",
    "the gamma ray fluxes in the tev range could be detectable even by present experiments if the crs are in equipartition with the gas in the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , if no flux is detected , this will put a strong constraint on the equipartition assumption .",
    "while the low energy integral gamma ray flux is very weakly dependent on the choice of the diffusion coefficient , the correspondent flux at higher energies is more sensitive to it , since , as explained above , the position of the knee is affected by this choice . in the context of a kolmogorov spectrum , the maximum diffusion coefficient is obtained for a larger value of @xmath69 .",
    "the choice @xmath106 kpc was inspired by the typical size of the galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the largest scale where the magnetic fluctuations are injected is the typical distance between galaxies , of the order of @xmath107 kpc . for @xmath108",
    "kpc the position of the knee is at @xmath104 tev , while for @xmath107 kpc the knee is at @xmath109 gev .",
    "however , since the steepening in the gamma ray spectrum begins at large energy , the difference in the plots caused by the use of this larger diffusion coefficient is a factor @xmath110 at @xmath111 gev ( for @xmath87 mpc ) , so that the possibility of detecting the gamma ray fluxes in this energy region is not appreciably affected and remains an interesting possibility .",
    "the situation improves rapidly with an increasing @xmath32 .",
    "in fact the value of the knee energy for a kolmogorov spectrum goes like @xmath112 and high energy crs are easily confined in a region of @xmath113 mpc . if , following ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , we use @xmath114 mpc , then , as shown before the absolute gamma ray fluxes increase at all energies by a factor @xmath115 and the steepening at high energy is only found at @xmath116 tev for the diffusion coefficient in eq . (",
    "[ eq : diff ] ) .    at present",
    "we can only use the egret limit as a constraint . for coma",
    "this limit implies that the energy density must be smaller than @xmath117 of the equipartition value if the crs are mainly contributed by sources in the central part of the cluster ( with @xmath87 mpc ) .",
    "if injection occurs uniformly over the cluster volume , than the equipartition cr energy density is compatible with the egret limit ( for @xmath87 mpc ) .",
    "for virgo cluster the egret limit implies that the energy density in crs must be smaller than @xmath79 of the equipartition value for the case of sources in the center .    as stressed above , the case of equipartition in a larger region , ( ensslin et al .",
    "( 1998a ) ) is already ruled out by present gamma ray observations by egret . as a consequence the cr energy density in this case for coma is forced to be @xmath118 of the equipartition value for a point source and @xmath119 for homogeneous injection .",
    "we suggest that experiments like stacee , hegra , whipple and future gamma ray experiments look at the signal from nearby clusters , because this could definitely confirm or rule out the possibility that equipartition of crs with the thermal gas is achieved in clusters of galaxies , or at least impose new and stronger constraints on the maximum allowed cr energy density in clusters .",
