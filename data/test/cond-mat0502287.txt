    "we believe that our force - based resolution of @xmath2 and @xmath10 events is equivalent to that of herdtle and aref @xcite since the same film asymmetries that lead to side - shedding at microscopic scales in their model will lead to vertex shedding from @xmath7-fold vertices in our model .",
