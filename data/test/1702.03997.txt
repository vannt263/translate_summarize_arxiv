    "the plasma membrane is a complex fluid where lipids and proteins continuously interact and generate signaling platforms in order to communicate with the outside world .",
    "one of the key mechanisms by which membrane molecules search reaction sites is based on lateral diffusion .",
    "quantitative imaging methods , such as single - particle tracking @xcite , spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy @xcite , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) @xcite , and sted - fcs @xcite , show that the dynamics of proteins and lipids in the plasma membrane often deviate from normal diffusion .",
    "in particular , the mean square displacement ( msd ) does not grow linearly in time as expected for brownian motion @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests processes that hinder diffusion .",
    "since the formation of protein complexes is governed by diffusion - mediated encounters , hindered diffusion plays fundamental roles in cell function .",
    "unveiling the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed anomalous diffusion on the cell membrane is critical to understanding cell behavior .",
    "anomalous diffusion in the plasma membrane can be caused by macromolecular crowding @xcite , transient binding @xcite , heterogeneities @xcite , and membrane compartmentalization by the underlying cytoskeleton @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has become evident that a single mechanism can not account for the complex dynamics observed in the plasma membrane @xcite .",
    "we have shown that interactions with clathrin coated pits ( ccps ) cause anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking @xcite .",
    "however , it was observed that this process coexisted with a different anomalous diffusion mechanism attributed to diffusion within a fractal topology",
    ". experimental evidence for the organization of the plasma membrane by the cortical actin cytoskeleton has been provided by measurements in cell blebs , spherical protrusions that lack actin cytoskeleton @xcite , and in the presence of actin - disrupting agents @xcite .",
    "the picket - fence model explains these observations by postulating that the mobility of membrane - bound molecules is hindered by the actin - based cytoskeleton in close proximity to the plasma membrane , leading to transient confinement @xcite .",
    "confinement and segregation of membrane components can have important physiological consequences by allowing the formation of functional domains on the cell surface .",
    "however , in spite of the vast evidence that has accumulated over the last two decades , a direct observation of the dynamic compartmentalization of membrane proteins by underlying actin fences is challenging due to the spatial and temporal resolutions required for its visualization .    here",
    "we employ superresolution imaging and single - particle tracking of membrane proteins to elucidate the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane by intracellular structures . while tracking individual voltage - gated potassium channels as described in our previous studies @xcite , we found that these membrane proteins exhibited anomalous diffusion on the cell surface .",
    "we now report that the anticorrelated dynamics are best modeled by obstructed diffusion instead of fractional brownian motion and we directly visualize the transient confinement of potassium channels by cortical actin in live cells . in order to characterize the cortical actin meshwork",
    ", we employ stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( storm ) to obtain superresolution images in fixed cells .",
    "we find a non - integer fractal dimension for the actin cortex and a broad distribution of compartment sizes as expected for a self - similar structure .",
    "these observations consistently explain the anticorrelated subdiffusive motion of membrane proteins and provide new insights on the hierarchical organization of the plasma membrane .",
    "voltage - gated potassium channels kv1.4 and kv2.1 were expressed in human embryonic kidney ( hek ) cells , labeled with quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite , and imaged using total internal reflection fluorescence ( tirf ) microscopy at 50 frames / s , so that individual molecules could be detected on the cell surface . kv1.4 and 2.1 are similar in size , 654 and 853 amino acids , respectively , but share less than 20% overall amino acid identity @xcite .",
    "they are placed into distinct gene subfamilies because of this low identity .",
    "they are most similar within a central core domain composed of six transmembrane alpha helices and the ion conducting pore .",
    "in contrast , they share no amino sequence identity within the cytoplasmic n- and c - terminal regions ; each kv1.4 subunit has 402 cytoplasmic amino acids while the kv2.1 subunits have 624 .",
    "both channels exist as homotetrameric structures giving the functional channel 24 membrane spanning domains and a total of either 1608 or 2496 cytoplasmic amino acids .",
    "figure  [ fig : turn](a ) shows representative trajectories of kv1.4 channels .",
    "the motion of the ion channels was initially evaluated in terms of their time - averaged msd , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total experimental time , @xmath2 the particle position , and @xmath3 the lag time , i.e. , the time difference over which the msd is computed .",
    "when a particle displays brownian diffusion , the msd is linear in lag time , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , anomalous diffusion is characterized by a different msd scaling , namely msd @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the anomalous exponent .",
    "anomalous diffusion is classified as subdiffusion when @xmath7 and superdiffusion when @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : turn](b ) shows the msd of 20 individual trajectories .",
    "the msds of kv1.4 as well as kv2.1 channels show subdiffusive behavior , albeit with large apparent fluctuations .",
    "figures  [ fig : turn](c ) and  [ fig : turn](d ) show the msds averaged over 1,312 kv1.4 ( @xmath9 cells ) and 6,385 kv2.1 ( @xmath10 cells ) trajectories , respectively , @xmath11 . throughout the manuscript we employ overlines to denote time averages and brackets to denote ensemble averages .",
    "the anomalous exponent @xmath6 of kv1.4 was found to be 0.89 and that of kv2.1 was 0.74 , indicating subdiffusion in both cases .",
    "several distinct mathematical models lead to subdiffusion @xcite . among the most well - accepted types of subdiffusion in biological systems",
    ", we encounter ( i ) obstructed diffusion , ( ii ) fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , and ( iii ) continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) .",
    "both fbm @xcite and obstructed diffusion @xcite are models for subdiffusive random walks with anticorrelated increments that have been extensively used in live cells .",
    "fbm describes the motion in a viscoelastic fluid @xcite , which can be caused by macromolecular crowding @xcite .",
    "fbm is a generalization of brownian motion that incorporates correlations with power - law memory .",
    "it is characterized by a hurst exponent @xmath12 that translates into an anomalous exponent @xmath13 . obstructed",
    "diffusion describes the motion of a particle hindered by immobile ( or slowly moving ) obstacles , e.g. , percolation . as the concentration of immobile obstacles increases , the availability of space decreases . near a critical concentration known as percolation threshold , the obstacles form a fractal with dead ends in all length scales .",
    "in particular , the reduction of the available space results in anomalous diffusion with a recurrent exploration pattern . a ctrw is a generalization of a random walk where a particle waits for a random time between steps @xcite .",
    "when the waiting times are asymptotically distributed according to a power law such that the mean waiting time diverges , the ctrw is subdiffusive .",
    "these three models describe very distinct physical underlying mechanisms but they can yield similar sublinear msd scaling , particularly in obstructed diffusion and fbm models . thus the msd analysis is insufficient to elucidate the type of random walk .    different tests beyond the msd have been employed to distinguish among types of subdiffusive random walks , including _",
    "p_-variations @xcite , first passage probability distribution @xcite , mean maximal excursion @xcite , gaussianity @xcite , and fractal dimensions @xcite . here",
    "we employ the distribution of directional changes , i.e. , the turning angles , a tool that probes correlations in the particle displacements and has been shown to contain information on the complexity of a random walk @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : turn](e ) illustrates the construction of turning angles from a particle trajectory . in simple brownian motion , the turning angles are uniformly distributed .",
    "contrastingly , when the steps are correlated the distribution of turning angles is not uniform @xcite . figures  [ fig : turn](f ) and  [ fig : turn](g ) show the distribution of turning angles of kv1.4 and kv2.1 for different lag times ( 1,312 kv1.4 tracks , 10 cells and 6,385 kv2.1 tracks , 14 cells ) .",
    "both distributions peak at @xmath14 indicating the particles are more likely to turn back than to move forward .",
    "in other words , kv channels have a preference to go in the direction from where they came rather than to persist moving in the same direction .",
    "this property is a fingerprint of subdiffusive random walks with anticorrelated increments . besides the shape of the distribution , the dependence on lag time bears valuable information .",
    "strikingly , we observe that the distribution is independent of lag time , i.e. , we measure the same distribution of directional changes whether the lag time is 20 ms or 1 s.    we examined numerical simulations of fbm and obstructed diffusion and found that they have distinctive attributes in their distribution of directional changes . figure  [ fig : turn](h ) shows the distribution of directional changes for subdiffusive fbm simulations with hurst exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 . even though the distributions peak at @xmath17 , the probability density function is different from the experimental data [ figs .",
    "[ fig : turn](f ) and  [ fig : turn](g ) ] . in our experimental data ,",
    "the turning angle distributions increase sharply as @xmath18 approaches @xmath17 and most of the deviations from a uniform distribution are above @xmath19 .",
    "however , fbm gives rise to a gradual increase that takes place mainly in the range @xmath20 .",
    "further , the turning angles of fbm reach a plateau , in contrast to our measurements .",
    "conversely , obstructed diffusion , strongly resembles our experimental results .",
    "figure  [ fig : turn](i ) shows the turning angle distribution for obstructed diffusion simulations in a square lattice with obstacle concentrations @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath22 is slightly above the percolation threshold .",
    "these results show that the motion of kv channels in the plasma membrane is better modeled by percolation , i.e. , obstructed diffusion , rather than motion in a viscoelastic medium , i.e. , fbm .",
    "potential obstacle candidates for obstructed diffusion in the plasma membrane are the cortical cytoskeleton , lipid rafts , and extracellular glycans . by evaluating the msd and turning angle distribution of @xmath3c318 , a mutant in which the last 318 amino acids of the c - terminus of kv2.1 channel had been deleted @xcite",
    ", we found that the anticorrelated diffusion originates from interactions with intracellular structures .",
    "we observed that @xmath3c318 channels diffuse freely in the plasma membrane , @xmath23 with a diffusion coefficient @xmath24/s [ fig .  [ fig : turn](j ) , n=3114 tracks , 5 cells ] .",
    "further , the distribution of turning angles of @xmath3c318 was flattened , as expected for brownian diffusion [ fig .",
    "[ fig : turn](k ) ] , indicating the intracellular c terminal domain of kv2.1 plays a key role in the anticorrelations within the particle trajectory . even though the distribution of turning angles in the @xmath3c318 mutant is close to that in brownian motion , a small peak is still noticeable at @xmath17 suggesting additional complexities in the plasma membrane .",
    "in contrast to kv1.4 , which is homogeneously distributed on the cell membrane , a subpopulation of kv2.1 channels forms micron - sized clusters that localize to endoplasmic reticulum ( er)-plasma membrane junctions @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect both the er and the cortical cytoskeleton introduce intracellular interactions with kv2.1 channels .",
    "to identify the origin of the observed anticorrelated diffusion , we analyzed the motion of non - clustered kv2.1 channels , i.e. , the channels that reside outside er - plasma membrane junctions .",
    "we labeled kv2.1 channels both with green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and qds @xcite . while all the channels were labeled with gfp , only a small fraction included qds in order to enable both single - particle tracking and cluster identification [ supplementary fig .",
    "we observed that the distribution of directional changes of non - clustered channels is indistinguishable from that of the overall population [ supplementary fig",
    "thus , we can exclude interactions with the er as the cause for anticorrelated subdiffusion .",
    "these observations suggest that diffusion is hindered by intracellular components , possibly the cortical cytoskeleton , in agreement with a membrane - skeleton fence model @xcite .",
    "we observed that the distribution of turning angles were independent of lag times [ figs .",
    "[ fig : turn](f ) and  [ fig : turn](g ) ] within the probed spatial and temporal scales .",
    "these observations indicated the anticorrelated subdiffusion of kv channels did not have an evident characteristic time scale .",
    "this type of random walk is consistent with diffusion on a self - similar structure , i.e. , a fractal subspace . in order to visualize the difference between diffusion on a fractal structure , and diffusion on a meshwork with a characteristic length scale",
    ", we performed simulations of motion of a particle in the presence of permeable fences that introduce compartments with a well - defined length scale [ supplementary fig .",
    "s3 ] . in these simulations",
    ", we observed that the distribution of turning angles is not time invariant ; the peak at @xmath17 grows as we increase the lag - time up to a characteristic time , and then it decays when the lag - time increases further [ supplementary figs .",
    "s3(b ) and s3(c ) ] .",
    "thus , hop - diffusion with a narrow distribution of confinement sizes exhibits a time - dependent turning angle distribution ( with a well - defined characteristic time scale ) , in contrast to our experimental results where the turning angle distribution is time - invariant .",
    "we observed that kv channels undergo obstructed diffusion .",
    "the @xmath3c318 mutant data indicated that hindering of the particle motion originated within cytoplasmic structures in close proximity to the plasma membrane , in agreement with previous experimental evidence of transient confinement by the actin - based cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "thus we examined the cortical actin as a candidate for the observed obstructed diffusion in the plasma membrane .",
    "we imaged the cortical actin in live hek cells using the photoactivatable probe tdeosfp @xcite via an actin binding peptide ( abp ) that reversibly binds to f - actin @xcite .",
    "previous studies showed that expression of abp - tdeosfp does not affect the organization of the cytoskeleton @xcite . by activating a sparse subset of tdeosfp and individually localizing them with high precision",
    ", we generated photoactivated localization microscopy ( palm ) images using localizations from 100 frames ( 2  s ) , yielding a smooth video of the dynamic actin meshwork ( supplementary video s1 ) .",
    "both excitation and photoactivation were implemented in total internal reflection fluorescence ( tirf ) so that only the actin adjacent to the plasma membrane was imaged .",
    "the dissociation of abp - tdeosfp occurs with a time constant on the order of 40  s @xcite , thus the exchange within 2-s imaging is negligible .    figure  [ fig : effect](a ) shows a representative palm reconstruction of actin .",
    "although the number of localizations in 100 frames is not adequate to fully resolve the cortical actin and some faint fluorescent single - filament structures might be missed in the images , we could use the reconstructed palm image to study the interactions of the potassium channels with the actin cortex in live cells .",
    "previous breakthrough experiments have reported simultaneous imaging of cortical actin cytoskeleton and single - particle tracking @xcite . here , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "we perform for the first time simultaneous single - particle tracking measurements and imaging cortical actin with superresolution .    in order to find out whether actin - delimited domains as identified by palm hinder diffusion and compartmentalize the cell surface , we imaged and tracked kv1.4 and kv2.1 channels on the cell surface while simultaneously imaging the cortical actin . channels often remained confined within the areas enclosed by actin indicating actin acted as a barrier to channel diffusion .",
    "figures [ fig : effect](a ) and [ fig : effect](b ) show kv2.1 channel tracks for one video overlaid on the last reconstructed image of the cortical actin . however , this visualization method suffers from overlaying long trajectories on a single reconstruction image of the actin meshwork .",
    "in addition to being constrained by actin structures , some trajectories exhibit confinement within small nanoscale domains that do not appear to be enclosed by actin . we have previously shown that kv channels exhibit frequent immobilizations when the channels are captured within clathrin - coated pits @xcite .",
    "thus , the cortical actin cytoskeleton is not the sole mechanism by which the mobility of kv channels is hindered . in order to deal with these complexities ,",
    "we evaluated the msds as a function of proximity to actin .    given that actin hinders channel motility , we expect the particles to explore smaller areas when they are confined within smaller compartments . to test the actin fence hypothesis , we overlaid channel trajectories on the corresponding palm image of actin obtained in 2 s , a time scale in which the actin structure is fairly persistent [ supplementary video 1 ] , with a sliding time window 0.2 s. for example , trajectories of the channels from 0 to 2 s were overlaid on the first reconstructed actin frame and the trajectories in the interval 200 ms to 2.2 s were overlaid on the second actin palm frame .",
    "then we partitioned the trajectories into 200-ms intervals and classified each segment according to the maximum distance @xmath25 of the particle to the nearest actin feature , calculated using an euclidean distance map algorithm .",
    "we evaluated the ensemble - averaged msd @xmath26 of all the segments located at a specific distance away from actin , i.e. , we averaged the squared displacements in 200 ms of the particles transiently located a given distance from actin .",
    "figures  [ fig : effect](c ) and  [ fig : effect](d ) show the msd as a function of distance - to - actin for kv1.4 and kv2.1 .",
    "for both channels we observed that as molecules dwell closer to actin their msd decreases .    as a control of our method , we performed the same analysis for @xmath3c318 channels .",
    "because of the lack of the intracellular domain , these channels should not have any interaction with the cortical cytoskeleton .",
    "we observed that the msd of @xmath3c318 channels is independent of distance from actin [ fig .",
    "[ fig : effect](e ) ] , which demonstrates the effect of intracellular structure in the transient confinement of kv channels .",
    "when imaging live cells with palm , the number of frames used in the reconstruction is restricted by the cell dynamic nature . a low number of frames results in insufficient detected particles to accurately determine the structure , also having a deleterious effect on resolution . in contrast , very high spatial resolution can be obtained in fixed cells by collecting data over long times @xcite .",
    "therefore , we used tirf - storm to visualize the compartments formed by cortical actin in fixed cells .",
    "actin was labeled with phalloidin conjugated to alexa fluor 647 , which binds actin filaments with high specificity without significantly enlarging them @xcite .",
    "a total of 50,000 frames where used in the reconstruction . in our storm reconstructions we observed both thick and thin actin structures , fig  [ fig : storm](a ) .",
    "the finest structures that we observed had a cross section standard deviation of 20 nm ( fwhm=48 nm ) . figure  [ fig : storm](b ) shows the average cross section profile of 20 lines aligned by the center of each line .",
    "the thickness of these lines in the reconstruction is governed by the localization accuracy , @xmath27 nm ( mean @xmath28 sd , supplementary fig .",
    "s4 ) , which sets a lower bound on storm resolution .",
    "thus we are unable to determine whether these structures are individual filaments ( 10 nm in diameter ) or actin bundles .",
    "we employed a watershed segmentation algorithm @xcite to identify actin - delimited compartments in the storm reconstructions [ figs .",
    "[ fig : storm](c ) and [ fig : storm](d ) ] across the whole cell .",
    "the average percentage of the watershed meshwork covered by actin was @xmath29 ( mean @xmath28 sd , n=9 cells ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : storm](e ) shows the distribution of compartment areas ( @xmath30 compartments ) .",
    "the areas of the compartments are fitted well by a log - normal distribution , which is a subexponential heavy - tailed distribution in the sense that it decays more slowly than any exponential tail @xcite .",
    "the log - normal distribution is in good agreement with kolmogorov s model for the distribution of particle sizes after repeated breakage @xcite . when a particle is divided into fragments in such a way that the fragment proportions are independent of the original particle size , a log - normal distribution emerges in the particle sizes after random repeated fragmentation .",
    "analogously , actin - delimited compartments are split into smaller compartments by growing actin filaments and thus their distribution is predicted to be log - normal .",
    "( pearson correlation coefficient @xmath31 in log scales ) .",
    "representative example of box counting algorithm in one cell where the exponent yields @xmath32.,width=8 ]    in addition to the compartment area distribution , the relation between perimeter and area contains valuable information .",
    "perimeter - area relations have been extensively used to investigate the properties of complex planar shapes @xcite . as expected , we observe that areas and perimeters of the different compartments are highly correlated [ fig.[fig : fractal](a ) ] .",
    "this correlation indicates shape homogeneity among different compartments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the area exhibits the same scaling over the whole observed range , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are compartment area and perimeter , indicating the same statistical character at different scales , and suggesting that compartments formed by cortical actin are scale - invariant in the observed range .",
    "such scale invariance is a hallmark of a self - similar fractal structures .",
    "fractals are characterized by scaling properties governed by a non - integer dimension @xmath36 , i.e. , an anomalous dependence of the `` mass '' on the linear size of the system with @xmath37 . in a regular object such as a line , square , or cube , we would refer to its mass @xmath38 as the length , area or volume , respectively . in these regular cases the mass scales as @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 is the linear size and",
    "@xmath41 is the spatial dimension . on the other hand , fractals such as",
    "a sierpinsky gasket or a percolation cluster differ from euclidean spaces and display a fractional dimension @xcite .",
    "usually the capacity dimension is obtained using a box - counting algorithm that quantifies the mass scaling . in brief ,",
    "the structure is placed on a grid , the number of occupied `` boxes '' are counted , and the process is iterated for finer grids .",
    "the number of occupied boxes scales as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the box length .",
    "figure  [ fig : fractal](b ) shows the computation of the fractal dimension of the cortical actin meshwork from the storm image in a representative cell .",
    "the box counting analysis shows the actin structure exhibits statistical self - similarity over more than three decades .",
    "our data indicate the fractal dimension of the meshwork is @xmath44 ( @xmath45 cells ) .",
    "our current understanding of the plasma membrane is that of a complex partitioned fluid where molecules often undergo anomalous diffusion and can be segregated according to their function .",
    "we observe that k@xmath46 channels perform a random walk with antipersistent nature , i.e. , a random walk with an increased probability of returning to the site it just left .",
    "however elucidating the mechanisms that cause anomalous diffusion is not trivial because several different subdiffusion models lead to similar msd scaling .",
    "the analysis of k@xmath46 channel motion is further complicated by the occurrence of immobilizations with power law sojourn times , which introduce deviations from gaussian functions in the distribution of displacements @xcite .",
    "thus , we can not employ gaussianity - based tests to distinguish among complex antipersistent random walks .",
    "we find that the distribution of directional changes provides a robust test for the type of random walk .",
    "the measured channel trajectories are shown to be well described by obstructed diffusion but not by fbm .",
    "we observed that the kv2.1 intracellular domain played a key role in the anomalous diffusion , in agreement with previous observations showing that the depth at which a membrane protein extends into the cytoplasm determined how frequently it encountered mechanical barriers @xcite . the obvious candidate to obstruct the motion of proteins with large intracellular domains",
    "is the actin cytoskeleton .",
    "thus , we visualized the cortical actin with high temporal and spatial resolution and evaluated its effect on membrane protein dynamics . considering that some faint single - filament actin structures might not be accurately detected by palm imaging",
    ", we can miss some interactions between actin and membrane proteins .",
    "notwithstanding , we found that kv channels are transiently confined by permeable actin fences , confirming existing models for membrane compartmentalization as an organizing principle of the actin cytoskeleton @xcite . by studying the diffusion of kv2.1 channels outside er - plasma membrane junctions , we verified that the observed subdiffusion is not due to interactions with er .",
    "other intracellular components such as intermediate filaments could also hinder protein diffusion and further compartmentalize the cell membrane , but these cytoskeletal filaments were not studied in the present work .",
    "previous single - particle tracking works using lipids labeled with 40-nm gold nanoparticles have observed the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane of hek293 cells , with 70-nm mean compartment size @xcite .",
    "however , this compartmentalization occurs with molecules having virtually no cytoplasmic domains and with a residence time close to 3 ms . at time scales above 50",
    "ms , gold - labeled lipids were found to exhibit brownian diffusion with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath47 @xcite , similar to our observations for @xmath3c318 kv2.1 mutant .",
    "ion channels are observed to undergo anticorrelated anomalous diffusion over at least two orders of magnitude in time . in terms of percolation theory , this hints the cell surface is maintained close to criticality , i.e. , near the percolation threshold .",
    "however , this hypothesis seems highly unlikely .",
    "a more feasible explanation stems from the emergence of a scale - invariant structure under the plasma membrane .",
    "we directly observed that , within the probed spatial scale , the actin cortex has in fact a self - similar nature .",
    "it is possible to speculate that actin fractality develops from its branching structure .",
    "hierarchically branched structures have a fractal dimension @xmath36 such that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the bifurcation ratio and @xmath50 is the length - order ratio @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation ratio can be interpreted as the average number of branches that emerge after a bifurcation and the length - order ratio is defined as the ratio between incoming branch length and the length of the emerging branches until the next bifurcation @xcite .",
    "actin branching is driven by the arp2/3 complex @xcite with a bifurcation ratio @xmath51 . here",
    "we measure a meshwork fractal dimension @xmath32 , which can arise from a branching pattern with @xmath52 or , in other words , the daughter branch being on average @xmath53 shorter than the mother branch .",
    "the fractal dimension of the cytoskeleton is in line with a broad range of fractal geometries found in biology ranging from the lung alveoli to subcellular structures such as mitochondrial membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum @xcite .",
    "we propose that the fractal nature of the actin cortex is employed by the cell to organize the plasma membrane .",
    "the complexity of this structure leads to a hierarchical organization with domains in multiple length scales and the development of nested compartments .",
    "such a dynamic hierarchical organization facilitates the active segregation of domains with different functions and the maintenance of reactants near reaction centers .",
    "furthermore , the fractal nature of the cortical actin has broad implications for anomalous diffusion , for instance it could bridge the gap between the plasma membrane hop diffusion models and diffusion in a fractal that leads to anomalous dynamics over broad time scales .",
    "we foresee that a self - similar cytoskeleton structure also influences active actomyosin - mediated organization of the plasma membrane @xcite in such a way that these processes can take place over multiple length scales .    in conclusion ,",
    "our findings show that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized in a hierarchical fashion by a dynamic cortical actin fractal .",
    "we find that the anomalous diffusion of potassium channels is best modeled by obstructed diffusion or diffusion in a fractal . by combining palm imaging with single - particle tracking",
