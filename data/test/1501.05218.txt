    "an interesting framework for studying the non - perturbative quantum field theories is through the use of anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite . according to this duality , in principle",
    ", one can perform gravity calculations to find information about the field theory side or vice versa . in this context , the central charges of the dual theory ( cft ) relate to coupling constants of its dual gravity .",
    "therefore , einstein gravity with one coupling constant restricts the dual theory to a limited class of cft with equal central charges @xcite . for extension of the duality beyond this limit",
    ", one needs to involve higher curvature terms in the gravity action .",
    "it is clear that each correction term introduces a new coupling constant and therefore one may have cft theory with different central charges . indeed , this procedure leads to the richness of the cft theory @xcite .",
    "the most natural extension of general relativity with higher curvature terms and with the assumption of einstein  that the left hand side of the field equations is the most general symmetric conserved tensor containing no more than two - derivatives of the metric  is lovelock theory .",
    "lovelock @xcite found the most general symmetric conserved tensor satisfying this property .",
    "the resultant tensor is nonlinear in the riemann tensor and differs from the einstein tensor only if the spacetime has more than 4 dimensions .",
    "although lovelock gravity leads to second - order field equations and it has ghost free ads solution @xcite , it has been recently shown that quadratic and cubic gravities entail causality violation and there are stringent conditions on the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the problem with the total action of einstein gravity is that it is divergent when evaluated on the solutions @xcite . due to",
    "this fact , all the other conserved quantities which is calculated through the use of this action is also divergent .",
    "one way of eliminating these divergences is through the use of background subtraction method of brown and york @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the boundary surface is embedded in another ( background ) spacetime , and one subtracts the action evaluated on the embedded surface of the background spacetime from the total action .",
    "such a procedure causes the resulting physical quantities to depend on the choice of reference background .",
    "furthermore , it is not possible in general to embed the boundary surface into a background spacetime . for asymptotically ads solutions of einstein gravity ,",
    "one may remove the non - logarithmic divergences in the action by adding a counterterm action which is a functional of the boundary curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "indeed , this counterterm method furnishes a means for calculating the action and conserved quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite .",
    "although there may exist a very large number of possible invariants , only a finite number of them are non - vanishing in a given dimension on a boundary at infinity .",
    "this method has been applied to many cases such as black holes with rotation , nut charge , various topologies , rotating black strings with zero curvature horizons and rotating higher genus black branes @xcite .",
    "although the counterterm method applies for the case of a specially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "all of the works mentioned in the previous paragraph were limited to einstein gravity .",
    "although the counterterm of lovelock gravity with flat horizon has been introduced @xcite , only a few works related to the counterterm method have been done for lovelock gravity with curved horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that even for einstein gravity , the systematic construction that provides the form of the counterterms becomes cumbersome for high enough dimensions @xcite . indeed in this method , one should reconstruct the spacetime metric by solving iteratively the field equations in the fefferman - graham frame @xcite : @xmath0 dx^{i}dx^{j } , \\label{fefmet}\\]]where @xmath1 is the boundary data of an initial - value problem governed by the equations of motion .",
    "however , even for einstein - hilbert theory , solving the coefficients @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ fefmet ] ) as covariant functionals of @xmath3 is only possible for low enough dimensions .",
    "thus , it is expected that the holographic renormalization procedure would be even more complicated in lovelock gravity because of the nonlinearity of field equations . indeed , because of the nonlinearity of the field equations solving @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ fefmet ] ) as covariant functionals of @xmath5 would be even more cumbersome .",
    "so , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite presented an alternative construction of kounterterms . instead of adding counterterms to cancel the divergence at the boundary explained above , they circumvented the difficulties of the standard method by using kounterterms which depend on the intrinsic and the extrinsic curvatures of the boundary .",
    "they selected the kounterterms as the boundary terms which are regular on the asymptotic region .",
    "indeed , the regularization process is encoded in the boundary terms already presented and there is no need to add further counterterms .",
    "the exact rotating solutions of lovelock gravity with curved horizon are not introduced till now .",
    "indeed , only static solutions of lovelock gravity with different matter fields are known @xcite .",
    "so , because of the difficulties of the holographic renormalization procedure in lovelock gravity and the nonexistance of an exact rotating solution of this theory , we limit ourselves to the case of counterterms of lovelock gravity for static solutions .",
    "the counterterms of asymptotically ads static solutions of gauss - bonnet gravity have been introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "also , the finite action and global charges of asymptotically de sitter static solutions has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we like to apply the counterterm method to the case of the static solutions of the field equations of third order lovelock gravity with curved horizon .",
    "we define the cosmological constant in such a way that the maximally symmetric ads spacetime @xmath6be the vacuum solution of lovelock gravity .",
    "( [ adsmet ] ) @xmath7 is the metric of an ( @xmath8)-dimensional maximally symmetric space with curvature constant @xmath9 and volume @xmath10 . indeed , this choice of cosmological constant makes the asymptotic form of the solutions of lovelock gravity to be exactly the same as that of einstein gravity .",
    "thus , we expect that the counterterm introduced for einstein gravity in @xcite may remove the power law divergences in the action of lovelock gravity . although the counterterms which should be added to gauss - bonnet gravity in order to remove the power law divergences of the action for static solutions are introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , they depend on the gauss - bonnet coefficient . however , because of our choice of the cosmological constant , our counterterms are the same as those of einstein gravity and are independent of lovelock coefficients . in order to check our counterterms , we calculate the finite action and the mass of the black hole through the use of counterterm method",
    ". then , we use these finite quantities and the gibbs - duhem relation to obtain the entropy .",
    "we find that the calculated entropy of the black holes is consistent with the wald s formula @xcite . as another test of our counterterm method",
    ", we show that the mass obtained through the use of counterterm method satisfies the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we , also , perform a stability analysis of the black hole solutions in canonical ensemble and investigate the effects of third order lovelock term on the stability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sol ]",

    "inspired by ads / cft correspondence , one needs to add counterterms to the gravity action in order to get a finite action .",

    ", the boundary counterterms that cancel the divergences in einstein gravity may also cancel the divergences in lovelock gravity if one chooses the cosmological constant as in eq .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath50th order lovelock lagrangian @xmath51 calculated for the metric ( [ adsmet ] ) is independent of lovelock coefficients .",
    "that is , the different orders of lovelock action do not mix with each other and one may find the counterterms for different orders of lovelock terms separately .",
    "this point makes the calculation easier . of course",
    ", the coefficients of the various counterterms for different lovelock terms will be different , depend only on @xmath21 and will be independent of lovelock coefficients . thus , using the counterterms of einstein gravity @xcite , we may write the counterterms of third order lovelock gravity as @xmath52where @xmath53the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq .",

    "the reason that we use exactly the counterterms of einstein gravity is as follows .",
    "first , the boundary at @xmath63 for static solutions is a constant curvature hypersurface and therefore no six - derivative term will be appeared in the counterterms . in other words , all the terms of a specific order of counterterms [ for example @xmath64 and @xmath65 in @xmath66 ) $ ] ] for static solutions",
    "are proportional to @xmath67 . also , @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , in order to remove the divergences of the action which are proportional to @xmath69 , any combination of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath68 can be used .",

    "that is , the dimensional - dependence of these coefficients are the same as those in einstein gravity .",

    "thus , we employed the counterterms introduced for einstein gravity in @xcite and found that the power law divergences of static solutions in the action of lovelock gravity can be removed by suitable choice of coefficients .",
    "we found that the counterterms are independent of lovelock coefficients and the dimensionally dependent of them is the same as those of einstein gravity .",
    "the main difference of our work with that of ref .",
    "[ 16 ] is that the counterterms are exactly the same as those of einstein gravity and do not depend on lovelock coefficients .",
    "the only job which remains is that one needs to calculate the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "for example if one wants to remove the divergences of the action due to the gauss - bonnet term , one should calculate @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 that remove the divergences of @xmath199 , without regarding the other lovelock terms .",
    "this enables one to generalize this method to other higher curvature theories of gravity easily , including fourth order lovelock gravity or @xmath200 gravity .",
    "we also introduced the finite energy - momentum tensor in third order lovelock gravity .",
    "in addition , we employed these counterterms to calculate the finite action and mass of the static black hole solutions of third order lovelock gravity .",
    "calculating the temperature , the electric charge and electric potential and using the calculated finite action and mass , we showed that the entropy calculated through the use of gibbs - duhem relation is consistent with the calculated entropy by wald s formula .",
    "we , also , showed that the conserved and thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "finally , we investigated the stability of charged black holes of lovelock gravity in canonical ensemble .",
    "we found that the black holes with respect to the sign of @xmath201 given in eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) may be divided into two classes .",
    "the negative @xmath201 ( small ) black holes show a phase transition between very small and small black holes , while the large black holes are stable .",
    "there is no black hole solution with medium size .",
    "of course by small black holes we mean the size of them with respect to the cosmological parameter @xmath21 . we , also , investigated the effects of third order lovelock term on the stability of the solutions .",
    "we found that there is no large black holes for large negative @xmath108 , while the black holes for small negative @xmath108 are not stable .",
    "we also found that as @xmath108 becomes larger , stable black holes may exist .",
    "this shows that there is a phase transition as the third order term of lovelock gravity becomes larger .",
    "finally , we found that there is no small black hole solution for positive @xmath108 , while the black hole with negative @xmath108 are stable .",
    "finally , we considered the uncharged black holes of lovelock gravity and found that negative @xmath201 solutions are not black holes with event horizon , while the positive @xmath201 black holes show a phase transition .",
