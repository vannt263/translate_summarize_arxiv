    "the modification of few - body properties such as the binding energy and the wave function of a bound state due to a medium of finite temperature and density is an important subject of many - particle theory . as an example we consider symmetric nuclear matter consisting of nucleons ( equal number of protons and neutrons ) at density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the modification of single - nucleon properties can be obtained from a dyson equation in terms of a self - energy . in a specific approximation",
    "the quasiparticle picture can be derived .",
    "a more rigorous description leads to the nucleon spectral function .",
    "similarly we can consider the two - nucleon system where the medium modification are obtained from a bethe - goldstone equation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the self - energy shift , also pauli - blocking has to be taken into account that is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , as a consequence , deuterons in nuclear matter become unbound if the density exceeds a certain value , the mott density .    of course , the same mechanisms are also responsible for the modification of higher clusters embedded in nuclear matter .",
    "however , the solution of the few - body in - medium equations where the effects of the medium are accounted for by a density and temperature dependent contribution to the hamiltonian has only been done within perturbation theory , see @xcite .",
    "therefore the results achieved for the energy shifts and the mott densities are only approximations .",
    "recently , rigorous methods have been used to find solutions for the three - body problem in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the faddeev equations are extended to include the effects of the medium , and the corresponding alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations have been solved  @xcite .",
    "different properties of the three - nucleon system in the medium such as the modification of the binding energy of the three - nucleon bound state  @xcite and the medium modification of the nucleon - deuteron break - up cross section  @xcite have been calculated .    in the present letter",
    "we give first results of the solution of the in - medium four - particle equation describing the modification of the binding energy of the @xmath0-particle in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "an ags - type equation has been solved and the results will be compared with those of perturbation theory .",
    "note that the four - particle correlations in low - density nuclear matter are very important because of the large binding energy of the @xmath0-particle .",
    "they have to be accounted for not only in equilibrium when considering the nuclear matter equation of state or the contributions of correlations to the single - nucleon spectral function , but also in nonequilibrium such as the light cluster formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the few - nucleon problem in nuclear matter can be treated using green function approaches . within the cluster - mean field expansion @xcite",
    ", a self - consistent system of equations can be derived describing a @xmath3-nucleon cluster moving in a mean field produced by the equilibrium mixture of clusters with arbitrary nucleon number @xmath4 .",
    "a dyson equation approach to describe clusters at finite temperatures and densities has been given in  @xcite .",
    "however , the self - consistent determination of the composition of the medium is a very challenging task that is not solved until now .",
    "we will perform the approximation where the correlations in the medium are neglected so that the embedding nuclear matter is described by the equilibrium distribution of quasiparticles ( see also @xcite for the two - particle problem , or @xcite for the three - particle problem ) .",
    "the extension of this formalism to describe @xmath3-nucleon correlations in nuclear matter will be given elsewhere .",
    "here , we will give some of the basic relations , which are direct generalizations of the three - particle case .",
    "let the hamiltonian of the system be given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 etc .",
    "denotes the heisenberg operator of the particle that includes quantum numbers such as spin @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the free resolvent @xmath9 for an @xmath3-particle cluster is given in matsubara - fourier representation by @xmath10 where @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a compact notation for matrices in the space of @xmath3 particles with respect to the particle indices given below . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the matsubara frequencies @xmath14 with @xmath15 for bosons and @xmath16 in the case of fermions . to simplify the notation we have further dropped the index @xmath3 on the matrices ,",
    "however use it if explicitly needed .",
    "the effective in - medium hamiltonian @xmath11 for noninteracting quasi - particles is given by @xmath17 where the energy shift @xmath18 and the fermi function @xmath19 are @xmath20 the notation @xmath21 means antisymmetrisation .",
    "the factor @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g0 ] ) resembles the pauli blocking or normalization of the green functions .",
    "this factor is different for the different clusters considered depending on the number of particles @xmath3 .",
    "it is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the upper sign is for an odd number of fermions ( fermi type ) and the lower for an even number of fermions ( bose type ) .",
    "note that @xmath24 .",
    "the full resolvent after matsubara - fourier transformation may be written in the following way @xmath25 where the potential @xmath26 is a sum of two - body interactions between pairs @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the two - body potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h ] ) .",
    "the sum runs over all unique pairs in the cluster .",
    "note , that as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : v2 ] ) @xmath30 , also @xmath31 that later on leads to right and left eigen  vectors .    to be more specific : if the interaction is between particle 1 and 2 ( in the pair @xmath32 of a cluster of @xmath3 particles ) the effective potential of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : v2 ] ) reads @xmath33 a useful notion is the channel resolvent @xmath34 for an @xmath3 particle cluster , where only the pair interaction in channel @xmath27 is considered .",
    "this may be written as @xmath35 using @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 it is possible to formally derive the resolvent equations in the standard way . to keep the formal equivalence to the isolated case , the @xmath3-particle channel @xmath39-matrix @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 with the use of @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defra ] ) leads to the well - known bethe - goldstone equation  @xcite @xmath43 we remark that similiar equations have been written down by various authors previously  @xcite .",
    "note that the above equations are also valid for the two - particle subsystem embedded in a larger cluster ( three , four , or more particles ) . as for the isolated equations",
    "the effects of the other particles appear only in the matsubara frequencies @xmath13 ( energies ) of the other particles in the cluster .",
    "no additional blocking factors @xmath12 related to the larger cluster arise .",
    "also note , that the changes due to the pauli blocking are in the resolvent @xmath9 not in the potential @xmath44 . however , it is possible to rewrite this equation and introduce an effective potential as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t2 ] ) and use unchanged resolvents instead . making use of the more intuitive picture of a blocking in the propagation of the particles ( related to the resolvents )",
    "we find by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t2 ] ) the correct expression for the @xmath39-matrix that enters into the boltzmann collision integral ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of the three - body equation is straight forward and has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the ags operator @xmath45  @xcite for the three particle system is defined by @xmath46 inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : defra ] ) and  ( [ eqn : t2 ] ) in the above identity we result with the ags - type equation @xmath47 that includes now medium effects as pauli blocking and self energy shifts .",
    "we used the notation @xmath48 .",
    "this equation solves the three - body transition operator for a three - particle cluster as well as for a three - particle cluster embedded in a more - particle cluster , i.e. the effect of the other particles in the cluster is again only in the matsubara frequency ( energy ) @xmath13 . the definition of the transition operator given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defutr ] ) was chosen so that no additional factor @xmath12 appears in the final equation .",
    "this guarantees that the cluster equations are valid also if they are part of a larger cluster .",
    "thus , the two - body subsystem @xmath39-matrix entering in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ags2 ] ) is the same as the one given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use all results of the few - body algebra , in particular those based on cluster decomposition .",
    "the in - medium bound state equation for an @xmath3-particle cluster follows from the homogeneous lippmann - schwinger equation and is given by @xmath49 where the sum is over all unique pairs in the cluster .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the three - body bound state it is convenient to introduce form factors @xmath50 that leads to the homogeneous in - medium ags - type equation @xmath51 we may generalize the ags method given in refs .",
    "@xcite to the in - medium four - body case  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 introducing the @xmath54 and @xmath55 cluster decomposition of the four - body system , denoted by @xmath56 , the sum on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : four ] ) may be rearranged by introducing four - body form factors @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise .",
    "the homogeneous in - medium ags - type equation for the four - body form factors is then written @xmath62 the driving kernel consists of the in - medium two - body @xmath39-matrix defined by the bethe - goldstone equation and the in - medium ags - type transition operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ags2 ] ) .",
    "note also that an additional pauli blocking factor @xmath63 occurs .",
    "the equations for the three - body scattering and bound state problem have been solved numerically in refs .",
    "an exploratory calculation to study a possible @xmath0-like condensate ( quartetting ) has been carried out using a variational ansatz for the ( 2 + 2 ) channel and by neglecting the ( 3 + 1 ) channel  @xcite .    because of the medium dependence of the equations the calculation time increases drastically",
    "this is due to the fact that the positions of the deuteron pole as well as the three - nucleon pole vary with the intrinsic momentum and are not fixed at the usual binding energy because of the phase space occupation through other particles .",
    "presently a sufficiently fast and accurate method to solve the three- and four - body equations relies on the separability of the subamplitutes that appear in the ags equations . to solve the four - body bound states we utilize the energy dependent pole expansion ( edpe )  @xcite that needs to be adjusted to the in - medium case , because of different right and left expansion functions due to the nonsymmetric effective potential .    to be more specific , we assume the following expansions for the amplitudes of the respective sub - systems embedded in the four - body equation . for the _ two - body _ sub - system we have @xmath64 the last equation of the right hand side is used in the present calculation and reflects a simple yamaguchi ansatz for the form factors  @xcite .",
    "the pauli blocking factor then appears explicitly .",
    "this has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite and a comparison to the paris potential is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the present purpose this approximation seems sufficient .",
    "for the _ three - body _ subamplitudes we use the edpe expansion @xmath65 with @xmath66 the sturmian functions corresponding to the fixed energy @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 introducing the form factors @xmath69 we obtain the following homogeneous system of integral equations @xmath70 formally these equations resemble the structure of the isolated four - body equations .",
    "however , the dominant features of the influence of the medium , i.e. the self - energy correction and the pauli blocking , are systematically taken into account .",
    "inclusion of spin - isospin degrees of freedom and symmetrization is a challenging task for the four - body problem and done as for the isolated case . to this end",
    "we have intoduced angle averaged pauli factors as explained e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite and fit the self - energy by use of effective masses .",
    "to solve the four - body equation numerically we use a yamaguchi type rank one potential for the @xmath71 and @xmath72 channels . the parameters are taken from an early work of gibson and lehman  @xcite .",
    "we renormalized the calculated binding energy of the @xmath0-particle so that it coincides for the isolated particle with the experimental one . presently , instead of using a more elaborated approach to the isolated four - nucleon problem we merely study the _ change _ of the binding energy due to the density and temperature of the surrounding nuclear matter . from our recent results for the three - body systems",
    "@xcite , we argue that the change is not very sensitive to the particular form of the potential .",
    "we shall , therefore , leave the study of model dependences for a future communication .",
    "we calculated the binding energy of an @xmath0-like cluster with zero center of mass momentum in symmetric nuclear matter at temperature @xmath2 = 10 mev as a function of the nucleon density .",
    "the results are shown as a solid line in fig .  1",
    ". the mott transition occurs at a single particle density of @xmath73 @xmath74 . for comparison",
    "we have given a perturbative calculation shown as dashed line .",
    "this calculation is based on a simple gaussian wave function for the @xmath0-particle with the width fitted to the electric rms radius .",
    "also the binding energy has been renormalized to the experimental value .",
    "the mott density in this case is at 0.0305 @xmath74 that strongly differs from the value gained from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : coup4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding curves for the triton and the deuteron are shown as dotted and dashed dotted lines respectively .",
    "note , that these binding energies are for clusters at rest in the medium .",
    "although it is an interesting case , when the sub - clusters embedded in the larger cluster vanishes as a bound state the sub - clusters in this case have a dynamical binding energy that depends on the c.m . momentum .",
    "nevertheless , the question of boromenian states and the effimov effect needs further investigation .    unlike for the triton the @xmath0-particle still exists at densities where the pauli blocking factor , see eq .",
    "( [ pauli ] ) , becomes negative .",
    "the usual procedure of symmetrizing the effective potential by proper square root factors fails .",
    "therefore when solving the four - body equation we have to keep track of the right and left eigenvectors in the subsystem .    in conclusion , we derived and solved for the first time an effective in - medium four - particle equation of the ags type .",
    "applying it to symmetric nuclear matter , we found that the binding energy of the @xmath0-particle decreases with increasing density due to pauli blocking and disappears at a critical value of the density ( about 1/10 of the nuclear matter density for @xmath2 = 10 mev ) .",
    "the dependence of the results on temperature and center of mass momentum will be the subject of an extended work .",
