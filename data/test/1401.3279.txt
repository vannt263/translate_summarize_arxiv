    "finally the full six - dimensional einstein s equation is given by , @xmath16 in the above expression @xmath17 , @xmath18 are bulk indices , @xmath19 , @xmath20 run over the usual four spacetime coordinates given by @xmath21 .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the metric in @xmath24 and @xmath25 hypersurfaces , respectively .",

    "the fact that @xmath36 is dependent on the coordinate @xmath6 makes the two hypersurfaces for y orbifolding to have a z - dependent energy density .",
    "the 3-brane located at @xmath37 suffers no warping and can be identified with the planck brane .",
    "the other three can be valid choices for standard model ( visible ) brane .",

    "a natural question that arises with this discussion is whether stabilization of these moduli to the desired values is possible .",
    "for the five - dimensional rs model this has been shown in @xcite by introducing a bulk stabilizing scalar field and tuning the vev of the scalar field at the boundaries .",
    "the modulus in the theory is stabilized near planck length without any fine - tuning .    in this case",
    "as well we can adopt a similar procedure by introducing a bulk stabilizing scalar field . again choosing appropriate vev at the boundary , we can stabilize @xmath8 and @xmath9 to desired values @xcite . in our six - dimensional braneworld scenario with @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependence ,",
    "the action for the scalar field can be expressed such that @xmath45 where the coupling parameters , @xmath46 tend to infinity as the scalar field approach to the following values , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "also in the above expression prime denote differentiation with respect to @xmath5 and dot denotes differentiation with respect to z. finally , the above equations with appropriate boundary condition @xcite can be solved , which when substituted into the action leads to an effective potential for the moduli as @xmath55,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the following shorthand notations , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . then solving the equations , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and then through the second derivatives with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath27 we can arrive at the minimum values of @xmath28 and @xmath27 . as an illustrative example we can start with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , leading to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that these values can resolve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "thus along this line any higher - dimensional braneworld models can have their moduli stabilized .",
    "from now on we shall assume that such a stabilization has been performed and all the moduli hence forth will have those stabilized values .",
    "in this analysis , following the stabilizing bulk scalar model , we have assumed that the backreaction of the bulk stabilizing field is negligibly small .",
    "moreover from the action of the bulk stabilizing scalar it may be observed that at the boundaries the stabilizing scalar tends to their vevs @xmath66 when the coupling @xmath67 tends to infinity . this is exactly similar to the five - dimensional counter part of the goldberger - wise calculation of modulus stabilization . as a result at the boundaries ,",
    "the stabilizing scalar is frozen to different values @xmath66 and hence does not contribute to the dynamics of the model .",

    "this keeps @xmath92 also order of unity . then from eq .",
    "( [ bm14a ] ) as well as from fig.[fig1 ] we observe that the modes @xmath85 are larger near the 3-brane at @xmath31 , which makes these low - mass kaluza - klein modes to be found preferentially near the @xmath31 region ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",

    "a possible experimental signature of the bulk scalar kk modes can originate via coupling of the bulk scalar to dihiggs in the form @xmath104 . for @xmath105",
    "the dominant decay channels are @xmath106 and @xmath107 which leads to multijets as final product which though may be difficult to differentiate from the qcd back ground @xcite .",
    "also when the mass of bulk scalar is in the range of @xmath108 to @xmath109 gev then enhanced production of @xmath110 occurs .",
    "moreover for bulk scalar mass in the range @xmath111 to @xmath108 gev we have a relatively larger cross sections for the diphoton channel . in this region due to",

    "moreover the bulk scalar field has been shown to have maximum value at the sm brane .",
    "hence the low - lying kk modes for the bulk scalar fields lie in the tev range with inverse tev self - coupling .",
    "thus the appearance of kk mode masses and couplings at tev scale are generic features of warped dimensional models with any number of extra warped dimensions as long as we want to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem without introducing any hierarchical moduli .",

    "this work now can be extended to other forms of bulk fields , which in turn may lead to the possibility of identifying various standard model particles as the low - lying kk excitation of various bulk fields , where the small warping in multiple directions can explain mass splitting in standard model particles as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the close spacing of the low - lying kk modes along with enhanced coupling makes it likely for them to be seen as a series of close - lying resonances . in order to investigate the role of kk mass modes through collider - based experiments",
    ", we consider the interaction of various modes with thermselves , i.e. , self - interactions , and we have obtained that all of them are suppressed to the tev scale by the warp factor . also from the numerical values of masses for low - lying kk modes",
    ", we readily observe that the masses in the standard rs model get split into infinite number of mass modes , with very close spacings , which is a very interesting feature of these multiply warped models and can be probed in future runs of lhc .",
    "the other things to be noted are that with stronger coupling of the kk modes of the bulk scalar field , one expects the decay widths to be larger , and thus the peaks to be broader as we go to higher and higher dimensions .",
    "the nature of the line shapes , therefore , will be an interesting benchmark to distinguish between higher - dimensional and lower - dimensional kk signals if such excitations appear during the high - luminosity runs of the lhc .",
