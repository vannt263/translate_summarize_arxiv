    "the study of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) and neutrinos ( uhe@xmath0s ) is currently a high priority in astroparticle physics with many experimental efforts being dedicated to these two related areas of research .",
    "uhecrs are routinely detected through the extensive atmospheric showers ( eas ) they produce when interacting in the atmosphere . despite the recent advances in the measurement of the flux of uhecrs  @xcite , their primary composition remains unknown  @xcite , and this is one of the main obstacles to extract precise conclusions on their origin .",
    "there are strong reasons to believe that uhe@xmath0s should be produced in the interactions of uhecrs with the material surrounding the sources , and/or in their propagation through the observed cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "however their detection has not yet been achieved .",
    "efforts are being made to improve the experimental situation in both fields .",
    "the challenge is to instrument sufficiently large target volumes to compensate for the low cross section and low fluxes for uhe@xmath0 detection , and to find measurements that provide large aperture at the highest energies and help to constrain the primary composition of uhecrs .",
    "the radio technique is being explored in both fields .    as early as in 1962 , g.  askaryan proposed to detect uhecrs and uhe@xmath0s by observing the coherent radio pulse from the excess of electrons in a shower developing in a dense , dielectric and nonabsorptive to radiowaves medium  @xcite .",
    "soon after , pulses were observed in coincidence with air shower arrays  @xcite .",
    "the emission is coherent in wavelengths which are large compared to the characteristic size of the electric charge and current distributions associated to the induced showers .",
    "the technique has been receiving a lot of attention in the field of astroparticle physics in the last decade because of the relatively low cost of the antennas needed for the detection systems .",
    "also , coherence implies that the pulse energy scales with the square of the primary energy which favours long range detection , a requirement to achieve large areas and volumes both for uhecr and uhe@xmath0 detection .",
    "indeed , quadratic scaling has been confirmed in accelerator experiments   @xcite leading to very strong pulses associated to uhe energy showers .",
    "a large number of initiatives have been made or are currently in development or planning stages .",
    "in dense media neutrino - induced showers are less than a meter in width and full coherence is expected to be mantained up to the ghz range ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of past and present experiments search for pulses at those frequencies produced by neutrinos in ice  @xcite , the moon regolith  @xcite or salt domes  @xcite .",
    "the largest and most promising experiments are in planning stages looking at ice  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic pulses emitted in the mhz - ghz frequency range by eas induced by uhecr are being measured in the hope of using this complementary information to constrain its composition and/or to develop new cost effective detection systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition the anita balloon flown antennas , initially devised to search for neutrinos , has recorded coherent pulses up to the ghz range  @xcite consistent with eas induced by uhecrs and there are plans for future developments  @xcite .",
    "the success of the radio technique requires an accurate and computationally efficient calculation of the radio emission properties of uhe showers .",
    "it is necessary to perform this in an efficient way since the number of particles in a shower at eev energies is @xmath1 .",
    "simulation techniques for evaluating pulses in dense media have been used for more than 20 years  @xcite .",
    "the shower is simulated to obtain , for every particle track , the information needed to calculate its contribution to the electric field .",
    "the formula used for this purpose stems from an approximate solution of maxwell s equations in the fraunhofer limit  @xcite adapted for simulation purposes in  @xcite .",
    "the electric field due to a short charged particle track , assumed to be travelling at a constant speed , can be approximated by two terms which correspond to the start and end of the track .",
    "the resulting electric field depends on the particle speed and the angle between the line of sight from the track to the observer  @xcite . to calculate the emission in a shower , tracks",
    "are chosen so that the particle velocity can be approximated to be constant , and all track contributions are added taking into account interference effects .",
    "although the approximate formula is sufficient for many practical applications , its range of validity is limited in frequency and position of the observer with respect to the track .",
    "it is possible to extend its range of validity by subdividing each track in sub - intervals .",
    "the resulting algorithm ( often referred to as  zhs algorithm \" ) is easy to implement and fast enough for the simulation of particle showers .",
    "this is convenient since it has allowed the simulation of pulses in the fresnel region for neutrino detection  @xcite and in measurements of eas  @xcite .",
    "although the range of applicability of the algorithm is enhanced when used in this way , it is not obvious that the sum of the subcontributions correclty accounts for all the radiation in regions close to the emission source .",
    "the object of this article is to study the conditions for the zhs algorithm to be valid and to establish its accuracy . for this purpose",
    "we obtain in section ii an exact solution to the problem of a charged particle instantaneously accelerating to a constant speed and stopping abruptly after a discrete time interval @xcite .",
    "this allows us to establish the precise conditions necessary to turn this solution into the basic formula of the zhs algorithm . in section iii",
    "we compare the exact solutions for an infinite and a finite track to the result of the zhs algorithm , and stress the compatible interpretation of the radiation regime in terms of cherenkov radiation for both cases . in section",
    "iv we compare the exact solution of the single track problem in nearby regions with the results of applying the zhs algorithm with track subdivisions to test its validity and accuracy .",
    "section v is devoted to discussing the zhs algorithm in relation to other approximations made to calculate the pulses emitted from showers .",

    "the exact and simulated results are compared for tracks in a variety of circumstances to illustrate both the behavior of the fields and the validity of the approximation made in different frequency and distance ranges .",
    "we have shown that the range of validity of the expressions can be greatly enlarged by subdividing long charged particle tracks in smaller sub - tracks and adding up the conributions , as it is done in the zhs algorithm .",

    "the comparison of the saddle point approximation to both the exact solution and the zhs algorithm give compatible results confirming that both approaches reproduce the radiation emitted from showers .",
    "the results presented here in summary confirm that the zhs algorithm can be used to describe most practical applications to detect pulses emitted from high energy showers produced in dense media by neutrinos .",
    "the approach only begins to show significant discrepancies when the observer is at distances comparable to the lateral dimensions of the shower ( @xmath197  1  m in ice ) .",
    "since the typical distance between antennas in experiments such as the askaryan radio array ( ara ) @xcite is @xmath139 m , we expect the results to be accurate enough in most practical situations .",
