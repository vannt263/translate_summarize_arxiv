    "since its prediction in 1954 @xcite , the effect of superradiance has attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental attention @xcite .",
    "its basic principle  the fact that a coherent interaction of an unexcited gas with the vacuum of a common field can create a spontaneous macroscopic excitation of both matter and field subsystems  appears in various incarnations in diverse branches of physics @xcite .",
    "the dicke model @xcite of superradiance resorts to a maximal simplification of the problem to capture the main features of the superradiant transition in the most transparent way .",
    "the model shows a thermal phase transition , analyzed and discussed in refs.@xcite , as well as a zero - temperature ( ground - state ) quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , which was realized experimentally with the aid of a superfluid gas in a cavity @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical analyses showed that the model exhibits also a novel type of criticality  the one observed in the spectrum of excited states @xcite .",
    "these so - called excited - state quantum phase transitions ( esqpts ) affect both the density of quantum levels as a function of energy and their flow with varying control parameters , and are present in a wide variety of quantum models with low numbers of degrees of freedom @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze properties of a simple superradiance model interpolating between the familiar dicke @xcite and tavis - cummings @xcite hamiltonians .",
    "a smooth crossover between both limiting cases is achieved by a continuous variation of a model parameter , which allows one to observe the system s metamorphosis on the way from the fully integrable ( hence at least partly understandable ) to a prevailingly chaotic ( so entirely numerical ) regime .",
    "one of the aims of our work is to survey the phase - transitional properties of the extended model and to investigate the nature of its _ quantum phases_the domains of the excited spectrum in between the esqpt critical borderlines .",
    "a usual approach to characterize different phases related to the ground state of a quantum system makes use of suitable order parameters , i.e. , expectation values of some observables .",
    "we show that an unmistakable characterization of phases involving excited states is not achieved through the expectation values alone but rather through their different smoothed energy dependences ( trends ) .    the main emphasis of our analysis is nevertheless put on the entanglement properties of excited states across the whole spectrum and their potential links to esqpts and quantum phases of the model .",
    "it is known that a continuous ground - state qpt in many models ( including the present one ) is characterized by a singular growth of entanglement within the system , which can be seen as a quantum counterpart of the diverging correlation length in continuous thermal phase transitions @xcite .",
    "a question therefore appears whether there exist any entanglement - related signatures of esqpts .",
    "the extended dicke model is rather suitable for a case study of this type since it allows one to analyze at once various types of entanglement  that between the field and all atoms , and that between individual atoms .",
    "it should be stressed that robust , systematic studies of entanglement in excited spectra of any systems are rather scarce .",
    "we hope that results of our analysis , which is unavoidably model - specific , will initiate similar studies in other relevant systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : basic quantum and classical features of the model are described in sec.[edm ] .",
    "thermal and quantum critical properties and a classification of thermodynamic and quantum phases are presented in sec.[pt ] .",
    "the atom  field and atom  atom entanglement properties are investigated in sec.[ent ] .",

    "consider single - mode electromagnetic field with photon energy @xmath0 ( polarization neglected ) interacting with an ensemble of @xmath1 two - level atoms , all with the same level energies @xmath2 .",
    "the free hamiltonian reads as @xmath3 where the first term describes the field of photons , created and annihilated by bosonic operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and the second term represents the ensemble of atoms , with @xmath6 standing for the third pauli matrix acting in the space of the @xmath7th atom . in the following we use all pauli matrices @xmath8 with the subscripts @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the interaction term is taken in the dipole approximation , with the dipole operator for the @xmath7th atom proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the size of the atomic ensemble is assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength of photons ( cavity size ) .",
    "then @xmath12 where the coupling parameter ( in units of energy ) can be written as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 standing for the electric dipole moment matrix element , @xmath15 for the vacuum permitivity , and @xmath16 for the cavity volume .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 represents the well known dicke model @xcite .",
    "it is commonly invoked to explain basic features of the transition of matter to superradiant phase @xcite .",
    "indeed , as shown below , if the coupling strength @xmath18 is sufficiently increased , the superradiant phase with @xmath19 and @xmath20 is created at low temperatures .",
    "note that the diamagnetic term @xmath21 is neglected here though it turns out to be very important in the discussion of superradiance in realistic situations connected to cavity electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that recent experimental realizations of the dicke hamiltonian @xcite do not implement the above electrodynamic content , nevertheless in this presentation we keep this original formulation as a widely comprehensible background .",
    "introducing collective quasi - spin operators for the whole atomic ensemble ( which is possible due to the long wavelength approximation ) , @xmath22 one immediately sees that the dicke hamiltonian conserves the squared quasi - spin @xmath23 with eigenvalues @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is integer for @xmath1 even or half - integer for @xmath1 odd .",
    "the full atomic hilbert space is the span of all @xmath26 possible configurations of atoms , thus @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the space of the @xmath7th atom .",

    ", we will investigate thermodynamic properties of the model in the full atomic space @xmath35 , as well as quantum properties in a single-@xmath25 space @xmath36 .",
    "the most natural choice in the latter case is the unique ( @xmath34=1 ) subspace with maximal value @xmath37 , which is fully symmetric under the exchange of atoms and therefore emphasizes the collective character of the superradiance phenomenon .",
    "a general-@xmath25 subspace has a mixed exchange symmetry such that only a number of @xmath38 atoms can be excited independently , while excitations of the remaining @xmath39 atoms have to compensate each other ( in ref.@xcite the quantum number @xmath25 is called a cooperation number of the atomic gas ) @xcite .",
    "the reduced single-@xmath25 model has only two effective degrees of freedom , one associated with the bosonic field , the other with the su(2 ) algebra of collective quasi - spin operators ( [ jbul ] ) , hence @xmath40 .",
    "in contrast , in the full ( all-@xmath25 ) model each su(2)@xmath41 algebra of atom @xmath7 brings an independent degree of freedom , so the whole atom ",
    "field system has @xmath42 .",
    "the dicke model is sometimes simplified by omitting the terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 , that for @xmath45 and very small @xmath18 yield negligible contributions to the transition amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the reduced model , in case of @xmath46 atoms called the tavis - cummings model @xcite , has an advantage of being completely integrable because of the existence of an additional integral of motion : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of bosons and @xmath49 the number of excited atoms ( taking values @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 quantum number ) .",
    "this conservation law follows from a u(1 ) symmetry under gauge  transformations consisting of a phase shift @xmath53 and a simultaneous rotation @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the rotation matrix by angle @xmath56 around axis @xmath57 .",
    "the quantity ( [ m ] ) is not conserved in the dicke model , although the full hamiltonian has a discrete z(2 ) symmetry with conserved parity  @xmath58 .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze properties of the single - mode superradiance model across the transition between the tavis - cummings and dicke regimes .",
