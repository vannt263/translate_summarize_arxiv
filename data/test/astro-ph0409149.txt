    "very active , late - type stars , e.g.  ,  and , show a bluer @xmath0 photometric colour with fainter @xmath1 photometric magnitude ( @xcite ) ; opposite to what one would expect from spotted stars .",
    "@xcite found that active giants ( from chromospherically active single - lined spectroscopic binaries ) later than g8 have a bluer @xmath0 than inactive giants of the same spectral type .",
    "the effect on @xmath0 is smaller than that on @xmath2 reported by @xcite .",
    "the most probable explanation , according to both papers , is a facular component in the photosphere of the active star .",
    "@xcite modelled @xmath0 as function of @xmath1 for  and concluded that the relation can not be explained by the bluer flux of the hotter secondary component becoming more dominant as the starspots rotate into view .",
    "it can , however , easily be explained by facular regions surrounding the starspots .    our goal is to investigate whether the faculae explanation can apply to other stars showing the same colour - brightness relation as .",
    "we describe here a similar modelling of the relation between colour and brightness for .",
    "( , ) is one of the most active and well studied  stars .",
    "the spectroscopic binary star is the primary ( a ) component of the visual binary ads  2644 and consists of a k1iv primary component and a g5v secondary component .",
    "the secondary ( b ) component of the visual binary is situated @xmath3 away and has spectral classification k3v ( @xcite ) .    in the following discussion",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite : components  aa and ab refer , respectively , to the more active k1iv primary component and the less active g5v secondary component of the spectroscopic binary .",
    "component  a refers to the primary component of the visual binary and will also be used for any combined properties of aa and ab .",
    "finally , component  b refers to the k3v secondary component of the visual binary .",
    "the photospheric and chromospheric activity is mainly associated with component  aa , but also ab has shown some spot activity ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this fact makes particularly interesting , since it results in a complicated colour - brightness relation as the activity varies on two stars simultaneously on a timescale of years .",
    "photometric data of in the johnson @xmath4 and @xmath1 bands were obtained with the t3 0.4  m automated photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "about half of the data has previously been published by @xcite , where descriptions of the observing and reduction procedures can be found .",
    "the observations of were made with a @xmath5 diaphragm , implying that component  b was also included in the measurements .",
    "for this reason we included b also in our modelling .",
    "we used the method of @xcite to calculate the differences in @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the whole system compared to the case of unspotted stars .",
    "the calculations resulted in @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the sense spotted minus unspotted and made use of the stellar and spot parameters as presented in table  [ tab : v711tau ] .",

    "this is the case for the stellar effective temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the stellar radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the spot temperature @xmath20 .",
    "we used the same @xmath20 for both aa and ab , in agreement with @xcite . only the very active aa was assumed to have faculae , in agreement with findings by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the facular temperature @xmath21 was set 250  k higher than the aa effective temperature , consistent with the modelling by @xcite .",
    "the changes in @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the whole system were modelled in two cases :    1 .",
    "the active regions were visible on both the active stars at the same time",
    "the active regions were visible on only one active star at a time .",
    "the observed changes in @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the results of the rotations of the aa and ab spotted surfaces .",
    "our model mimics the rotational modulation by varying the relative areas of the active regions .",
    "in order to compare our modelled @xmath6 to the observed values , we derived @xmath6 from the observations in the sense observed value minus the brightest observed value .",
    "similarly , we derived @xmath7 in the observations in the sense observed @xmath0 minus the average @xmath0 of those observations having @xmath22 .",
    "the brightest @xmath1 measurement represents the system as close to unspotted as we can get from the data .",
    "our results are presented in figure  [ fig : v711tau ] .",
    "the observations are shown as dots .",
    "the model calculation results are represented by open and filled circles with different sizes .",
    "the filled circles represent cases where the active regions contained only dark spots , and no faculae .",
    "the open circles represent cases where the active regions contained both dark spots and faculae ( but only for aa , as explained in section  [ sect : modelling ] ) .",
    "the varying sizes of the plotting symbols reflect varying relative areas of the active regions . along the lines connecting the plotting symbols , only the relative areas of the active regions",
    "were varied , mimicing the rotation of the system .",
    "the red , solid lines represent case  1 , where the active regions on both stars were visible at the same time .",
    "the blue , dashed lines represent case  2 , where the active regions on only one star were visible at a time .",
    "figure  [ fig : v711tau ] shows that the models with spots only ( filled circles ) can not explain the observed relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is the case even when ab is unspotted as the spots of aa rotate into view ( blue , dashed line , filled circles ) .",
    "the bluer flux of ab is insufficient to compensate for the redder flux of the starspots , given the parameters in table  [ tab : v711tau ] .",
    "@xcite made a test in the case of  to find for which stellar and spot parameters the bluer flux of the hotter secondary component would compensate for the redder flux of the starspots .",
    "they found that this requires such a low spot temperature and such a small primary component radius that the active component would be quite different from its listed spectral type , and this explanation consequently seems unlikely .    in both cases with faculae ( open circles in figure  [ fig : v711tau ] )",
    "the modelling results fall within the observed range in @xmath0 , thereby providing an explanation for the observed relation .",
    "the observations do not facilitate a distinction between cases  1 and 2 ( red , solid lines and blue , dashed lines , respectively ) , however .",
    "it seems likely that the spots of ab and the active regions of aa are visible at the same orbital phase during some observing seasons and at opposite phases during other seasons .",
    "this effect is likely to cause the large spread in the observed @xmath0 for all observed values of @xmath1 in figure  [ fig : v711tau ] ( also suggested by the two lines connected by open circles ) .",
    "we also note that the measurements towards redder @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : v711tau ] can represent cases where the active regions of aa contain spots only , and no faculae , as was also found in the case of  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that photospheric facular areas remain the most plausible explanation for the observed relation between @xmath0 photometric colour and @xmath1 photometric brightness for .",
    "the bluer flux of the hotter , less active component only partly compensates the redder flux of the cool starspots ."
