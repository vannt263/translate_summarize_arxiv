    "a useful tool in the equilibrium theory of colloidal mixtures is the ` integrating out ' of the degrees of freedom of one of the components @xcite .",
    "the resulting renormalisation of the interaction potential between the remaining particles in what has become an effective one - particle description , is often referred to as the depletion potential .",
    "depletion interactions play a central role in the current understanding of the phase behaviour of dispersions containing colloids of different size and/or shape and have a remarkably elegant physical interpretation , although strictly accurate only in the dilute limit .",
    "this interpretation hinges on the view that an imbalanced osmotic pressure pushes two test particles towards each other when they approach within a correlation length set by the other species @xcite .",
    "depletion potentials are often treated as true , instantaneous potentials even when considering time - dependent phenomena such as the kinetics of demixing and gelation @xcite .",
    "this is problematical as depletion interactions need time to build up through many collisions between a pair of test particles and the particles of the other species .",
    "this is ( also ) the reason why both in experiments @xcite and in computer simulations @xcite the ( mean ) depletion potential is only obtained after extensive averaging .",
    "here we show by means of scaling theory and brownian dynamics simulations that the static depletion interaction potential is only approached algebraically in time .",
    "clearly , this must have an impact upon processes such as phase - separation kinetics and gelation .    in this letter we first present the scaling theory of the decay of the fluctuations in the depletion force .",
    "next , we outline the simulation technique used and present the results of our simulations .",
    "we end the paper with concluding remarks .",
    "arguably , diffusive processes are at the root of the buildup of depletion forces , allowing us to estimate the kinetics thereof by fairly simple scaling arguments . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the situation of two parallel plates in a dispersion of ghost - like particles , which do not interact amongst themselves but only with the plates through volume exclusion .",
    "our arguments carry over straightforwardly to the more interestingly case of pairs of spheres , the results of which we give at the end of this section .",
    "considered are two parallel plates of linear dimension @xmath0 separated by a distance @xmath1 immersed in a dispersion of ( ghost ) particles of diameter @xmath2 at a number density @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of the ghost spheres induce a net interaction as they are excluded from the gap between the plates when @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 . according to the asakura - oosawa depletion theory , @xcite the mean interaction force between the plates",
    "is given by @xmath4 for all separations @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the osmotic pressure of the host dispersion and @xmath7 the thermal energy .",
    "for @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the mean number of ghost colloids @xmath10 contributing to the net force @xmath11 between the plates is equal to their mean density times the plate area times a diffusion length , and increases with time proportionally to @xmath12 with @xmath13 the diffusivity of species 2 and @xmath14 the time . assuming the ideal host dispersion to be in local equilibrium , it follows from standard statistical mechanics that the mean - square fluctuation of this number must also be of the order @xmath15 . as a consequence , the mean - square fluctuation",
    "@xmath16 of the depletion force should scale as @xmath17 . using the stokes - einstein relation @xmath18 for the diffusivity of colloid species 2 , with @xmath19 the viscosity of the solvent ,",
    "we thus obtain @xmath20 for @xmath21 , showing an algebraic decay with time as advertised in the introduction .",
    "this is due to our assumption of the diffusive nature of the coupling of the plates to the host dispersion .",
    "on account of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluctplate ] ) implies that the buildup of the depletion forces must also be algebraic in time . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluctplate ] ) we furthermore conclude that for @xmath22 the depletion interaction between the plates has saturated to its mean - field value .",
    "the plates act as a microscopic pressure gauge , which equilibrates faster , i.e. , has a smaller crossover time @xmath23 , the larger the plates , the higher the temperature , the higher the density of the ghost particles , et cetera , as one would in fact expect .",
    "our arguments carry over naturally to physically more interesting geometries such as pairs of large spheres immersed in dispersions of ( ghost ) spheres of different size , although that the available collision area and the diffusion volume are no longer trivial to evaluate , because they now depend on the size ratio of the spheres as well as on their separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nuts ] ) . here , we simply reproduce without proof for that particular case the final results for the mean and the mean - square fluctuation of the depletion force .",

    ", @xmath31 is an unknown constant of proportionality that we fix by fitting to the results of the brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "equation [ eq : fluctsphere ] holds also for @xmath32 provided we set @xmath33 ; the magnitude of the fluctuations in the depletion force level off to that of the net zero force on a single sphere , if the separation of the spheres is larger than the diameter of the ghost spheres .",
    "notice the non - obvious dependence of @xmath16 on time @xmath14 , distance @xmath1 and the size ratio @xmath34 , which we next test against the results of brownian dynamics simulations discussed next .",
    "brownian dynamics simulations were performed using the standard scheme developed by ermak @xcite .",
    "we fixed two test colloids at a distance @xmath1 in a simulation box of volume @xmath35 , and inserted @xmath36 ghost particles in the same box .",
    "the number of ghost colloids in the box is determined by the chemical potential in a hypothetical reservoir containing only ghost particles .",
    "depending on the size ratio and the density , between 50 and 1700 small ghost particles were present in the box .",
    "the ghost particles interact with the test particles through a hard - core - like steep repulsive potential that scales as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the interaction strength and @xmath39 is the distance between the centers of mass of a test colloid and a host particle .",
    "the force on the particles of species 1 is rendered dimensionless by multiplying with @xmath40 .",
    "simulation time was divided in a sequence of intervals of width @xmath14 . for each interval",
    "the net force @xmath41 along the vector connecting the centers of mass of the pair of test particles was calculated .",
    "the variance of the distribution of forces we define as the fluctuation in the force .",
    "the mean depletion force is simply obtained as @xmath42 , while @xmath43 . for small values of @xmath14",
    "the distribution of forces is highly non - gaussian , very broad and with a most probable force that is equal to zero .",
    "the distribution only becomes gaussian for large enough @xmath14 .",
    "we fit eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluctsphere ] ) to the simulation results by adjusting the parameter @xmath31 .    plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_t ] is the value of @xmath16 at contact , i.e. , for @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath14 for @xmath45 , @xmath46 at a ghost particle density @xmath47 .",
    "the time @xmath14 is normalised on the brownian time @xmath48 of the ghost particles , which is the time required for a small particle to diffuse over its diameter",
    ". also indicated is the fitted scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluctsphere ] ) . for small @xmath14 ,",
    "the diffusion length is small on the scale of the linear dimension of the test particles , and therefore approaches the result for the flat plate discussed earlier . for large times",
    "the scaling crosses over to @xmath49 , approaching the time dependence of a radially symmetric diffusion volume .",
    "interestingly , best fits were obtained setting @xmath50 although one would expect on basis of the quasi one - dimensional nature of the problem a value of @xmath51 .",
    "note that the description is quantitative over 5 decades in time .",
    "also in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : var_t ] is the square - mean depletion force @xmath52 . clearly , @xmath53 only if @xmath54 , i.e. , for times very much larger than the diffusion time of the host particles",
    "this means that for the case @xmath45 , the mean depletion force can not fully build up at the diffusion time of the guest particles .",
    "consequently , the actual depletion force felt by these particles must be dominated by fluctuations .",
    "the dependence of the fluctuations in the depletion force on the size ratio @xmath34 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_q ] for a fixed time @xmath55 and a fixed number density @xmath56 . shown",
    "are again the results for two test colloids at contact .",
    "brownian dynamics simulations and scaling theory agree quantitatively and demonstrate that the fluctuations are more prominent the lager the size ratio .",
    "we were not able to obtain reliable results for @xmath57 as those simulations required an exceedingly small time step to maintain numerical stability .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_r ] how the fluctuations vary with the distance between the particles for a given size ratio @xmath45 , density @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "the absolute value of the fluctuations in the depletion force increases with the distance between the test colloids and reaches the single particle value for @xmath27 .",
    "the _ relative _ fluctuations @xmath58 in fact diverge when @xmath59 as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : var_r ] .",
    "this means that fluctuations are _ always _ important in the tail of the depletion force .",
    "note that for separations close to @xmath33 , the fluctuations are slightly larger than predicted by the scaling theory .",
    "this discrepancy with scaling theory was not observed for other data sets with different @xmath34 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 , and we have no explanation for it .",
    "we have shown that the temporal fluctuations in the depletion force between two guest particles in a host dispersion of colloids of different size are significant .",
    "our results imply that the dynamics of approach of two such colloids must be strongly influenced by these fluctuations and the slow buildup of the depletion force .",
    "it stands to reason , then , that the onset of phase separation or of gelation in mixtures of colloids must be sensitive to them .",
    "therefore , one must be wary of treating the depletion potential as an instantaneous potential in kinetic studies @xcite .",
    "the question arises how the fluctuations discussed in this paper can be probed experimentally .",
    "one way would be to look at the dynamics of the depletion force using a tweezer experiment @xcite or a tirm experiment @xcite , analysing the data in a similar fashion as we have done in our simulations .",
    "as far as we know this has not been attempted yet .",
    "another way would be to look at the escape kinetics of a colloid pushed against a hard wall due to the presence of other colloids ( similar to the study of @xcite ) , which should be strongly influenced by a fluctuating depletion force .",
    "note added in proof : upon completion of this work we came across a preprint by bartolo and collaborators @xcite on fluctuations in medium - induced , casimir - type forces between parallel plates .",
    "these casimir - type forces are due to the coupling of the plates to a fluctuating background and are similar but not identical to the depletion forces described in this work , because the density fluctuations in our host dispersion are not scale invariant .",
    "however , they too find that the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation in the effective interaction between them scales as @xmath60 as we found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluctplate ] ) .                                       and the collision area @xmath61 for two spheres .",
    "the diffusion volume is defined as a spherical shell of thickness @xmath62 around a guest particle from which the host particles can diffuse towards the surface for collision .",
    "the collision area is the available area for collisions with a host particle taking into account momentum transfer only along the vector connecting the centers of mass of the two guest particles . ]     with @xmath63 the brownian timescale of the ghost particles .",
