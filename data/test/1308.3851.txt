    "the discovery of @xmath2 gev standard model(sm)-like higgs boson  @xcite indicates that the sm seems to be complete .",
    "however , there exist overwhelming evidences which convince us that the sm is at best an effective theory valid up to some energy scale . among them ,",
    "two of most intriguing evidences are the fine - tuning problem of the higgs mass and the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) . in the context of the sm",
    ", the conventional fine - tuning problem could be expressed as follows @xmath3 with @xmath4 in the above formula , @xmath5 are renormalized higgs , top - quark , w and z boson mass respectively , @xmath6 is the corresponding vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath7 is the bare higgs mass , and the cut off scale @xmath8 indicates where new physics enters into sm .",
    "the contributions from other quarks and leptons are neglected safely compared with that of top quark . in order to relax fine - tuning , we require @xmath9 thus we obtain @xmath10 gev . no new physics has been observed sofar at lhc which indicates that the cutoff might be larger than several tev . then new fields are required to soften the fine - tuning problem  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , the conventional veltman condition is realized .",
    "it is obvious that this condition could not be satisfied in the sm at low scale , since the top - quark s contribution is larger than the others in this case , giving rise to negative contribution to @xmath11 . ] in the paper of  @xcite , the field content of the sm is extended by a scalar singlet and a vector fermion field , where the later one only interacts with the @xmath12 through @xmath13 . while for absence of tadpole contributions , the self - energy come from @xmath13 and @xmath14 interaction are dropped . with",
    "the scalar singlet served as dark matter candidate , it was found that the fine - tuning of the higgs mass is a strict constraint for the higgs - portal coupling , and the number of scalar singlets @xmath15 , which is set to be larger than @xmath16 through direct detection constraint , i.e. , xenon100 experiment .",
    "this @xmath17 symmetry should be broken softly and make the lightest scalar @xmath12 to be dm candidate .",
    "the novelty here is that the tadpole contributions are non - negligible to respect gauge invariance of the higgs two - point green function  @xcite .",
    "the straightforward generalization of the above idea is introducing additional fermionic dm , which can interact with sm through higgs - portal . to improve the fine - tuning problem",
    ", the new fields entering into the veltman condition should be bosonic fields which provide positive contributions .",
    "on the contrary , the fermionic fields give negative contributions thus makes the problem worse .    in this work ,",
    "we consider both the scalar @xmath12 and vector field @xmath18 as dark matter candidate , both of them can annihilate into sm particles and each other through higgs - portal interaction .",
    "total dm relic density and direct direction experiments impose the stringent constraints on parameter space of our model .",
    "we then use allowed parameter space to revise the fine - tuning , unitarity and the vacuum stability of higgs boson .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we extend the conventional higgs - portal model to include two component dm candidates . dm relic abundances calculation and experiment constraints are present in section iii .",
    "the fine - tuning , unitarity and the vacuum stability of higgs boson are examined in section iv .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "to explain the existence of dm , the sm must be extended .",
    "the minimal model is to add the higgs - portal interactions , such as the singlet scalar , fermionic or vector field as dark matter candidate  @xcite",
    ".    the fermionic higgs - portal dark matter model could be the sm with effective interaction  @xcite , or renormalizable theory  @xcite .",
    "if we consider another dm component to be fermionic field besides the scalar one , then the number of scalars @xmath15 is even larger than the one without fermionic component .",
    "that is another reason why we choose the vector rather than the fermion as another dm component . to take vector field as dm candidate",
    ", one may use the higgs - portal vector dm model directly  @xcite or to generalize it to has extra @xmath19 gauge symmetry thus to make the model renormalizable  @xcite . for the @xmath12 and @xmath18 to be stable and may be dm candidate , we impose @xmath20 symmetry on @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the lagrangian for the vector and scalar dm interacting with sm through the higgs - portal is @xmath21 with @xmath22 where the scalar and vector dm mass are given by @xmath23    in this model , the @xmath11 becomes @xmath24 from the eq.([eq : vssm ] ) , we found that @xmath25 is easier to satisfy than that of @xmath26 , which could also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : svft ] .",
    "+    the significant difference from the previous paper  @xcite is that we take into account the tadpole contributions as could be seen in fig .",

    ", the mass of the @xmath12 to cure the vacuum instability should not be far away from the weak scale  @xcite , in the case of @xmath27 and that 1 tev@xmath28 tev , the fine - tuning of @xmath29 also need to be considered .",
    "it could be used to fix @xmath30 in terms of higgs - portal couplings @xmath31 , both of which will be constrained by the observed dm relic density and direct detection experiments .",
    "in our two component dm model , the dm sector contains a real gauge singlet scalar field , @xmath12 and a gauge singlet vector field @xmath18 . both of them will contribute to the total dm relic density in the universe .",
    "the leading annihilation channel is that the dm pairs annihilate into sm particles through higgs exchange , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) stands for sm particles ( anti - particles ) such as leptons and quarks , gauge bosons and higgs boson .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in the first two diagrams in fig .  [",

    "the relic density for each component can be calculated through @xmath74  @xcite , and the total relic density of dm is the sum of two components , @xmath75 .",
    "there are four free parameters in our model , including two dm mass parameters @xmath76 as well as two coupling parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "to illustrate how the interplay between the two dm components affects the evolution of dm abundances , we examine the evolution of dm abundances @xmath54 and @xmath55 in two limits :    1 .",

    "the dm abundances @xmath87 as a function of @xmath88 for both two limits are shown in fig .",

    ", one can see that the annihilation between two dm components imprints on the evolution of abundances . in the first limit ,",
    "dm abundances evolve almost independently , and the final dm abundances are mainly determined by their interaction with sm particles . while in the second limit , since the heavier dm component annihilate into lighter one , the abundance of lighter dm component increases in comparison with the previous case .",

    "3 .   scan in the @xmath99 plane , here we fix dm mass with @xmath100=500 gev , @xmath101=100 gev .    contour plots for three groups parameter space discussed above are displayed in figs .",

    "next , we will analysis them in detail one by one .    for the first group parameter space",
    "( see fig .  [",
    "fig : relicsv1 ] ) , we first note that the enhanced annihilation near the @xmath103 resonances explains the decrease in total dm relic density for @xmath104 gev . furthermore , the behavior of dm relic density for each component depends on the mass of vector component @xmath35 much heavier than the scalar one . in the large regions of @xmath35 ( @xmath105 gev ) ,",
    "the dm relic density is dominated by @xmath12 while @xmath106 dominates for @xmath107 gev . in the intermediate regions of @xmath35 ,",
    "both components give a significant contribution to the total dm relic density .",
    "this behavior can be explained as follows : the annihilation process @xmath108 plays a crucial role in this case , the cross section @xmath70 give the significant contribution when the @xmath29 and @xmath35 are both small , while it is negligible compared with @xmath109 when @xmath29 and @xmath35 are large .",
    "thus , in the large mass region , the dm relic density are mainly determined by their interaction with sm particles and due to the coupling parameters which we are chosen the final dm abundance is dominated with @xmath12 . however , in the small mass region , the abundance of @xmath18 get a considerable increase through annihilation process @xmath108 and dominates over that of @xmath12 .",
