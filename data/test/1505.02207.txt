    "charge - density wave ( cdw ) is widely observed in low - dimensional solids and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "transition metal dichalcogenides mx@xmath1 ( m = transition metal , x = s , se , te ) are one of the typical cdw materials with a layered triangular lattice structure .",
    "they show various cdw patterns , depending on the combination of m and x  @xcite , and quite often superconductivity ( sc ) is observed next to the cdw phase by applying pressure  @xcite , doping  @xcite , or intercalation  @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of cdw and sc has not been fully understood and it has been still under debate in spite of the long and extensive studies so far .",
    "recently , 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 , one of the old transition metal dichalcogenides , has again attracted much interests in the context of exciton condensation .",
    "this material is a semimetal or a semiconductor in room temperature  @xcite and shows a commensurate cdw transition with a @xmath2 superstructure below @xmath3k .",
    "the fermi surface ( fs ) partially remains even in the cdw phase due to the imperfect opening of the energy gap .",
    "the origin of the cdw phase is still controversial and the usual nesting mechanism seems unlikely due to its poor fs nesting  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , exciton condensation has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the cdw phase  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the large spectral weight transfer between ti 3@xmath4 and se 4@xmath5 bands and the flat energy spectrum just below the fermi energy have been observed  @xcite , strongly suggesting the possibility of exciton condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "another possible mechanism for the cdw transition is a band jahn - teller effect which results from electron - phonon interaction  @xcite .",
    "a large lattice distortion of several percent observed below @xmath6  @xcite indicates the strong coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it is proposed that both mechanisms work cooperatively for the cdw transition  @xcite .",
    "exciton condensation is a quantum state expected in low carrier density systems such as a semimetal or a semiconductor and has been extensively studied since 1960s  @xcite .",
    "the exciton is a bound pair of an electron and a hole in different bands mediated by the interband coulomb interaction .",
    "when the binding energy of an exciton exceeds the band gap , the system has an instability toward condensation of excitons , namely , a spontaneous hybridization between different bands .",
    "since the repulsive coulomb interaction is attractive between an electron and a hole , the exciton condensation is expected to occur in principle without considering any additional `` glue '' of the electron - hole pair .",
    "although extensive efforts have been devoted for half a century and several candidates have been proposed  @xcite , the generally accepted materials for the exciton condensation are still absent .",
    "therefore , any conclusive evidence for the exciton condensation in real materials is highly desired for further progress and 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 would be one of the promising examples .",
    "in the pioneering studies for exciton condensation  @xcite , an isotropic band dispersion with perfect fs nesting is assumed , for which the excitonic instability is always present in a semimetallic case .",
    "the extension to anisotropic band dispersions shows that the degree of fs nesting greatly affects the instability of exciton condensation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mean - field approximation generally overestimates the instability toward ordered states , including the exciton condensation .",
    "therefore , for discussion of the exciton condensation in real materials , the realistic band dispersion and the appropriate method beyond the mean - field approximation are both required .    in this paper , a half - filled two - band hubbard model with electron - phonon interaction in a triangular lattice",
    "is studied to understand the origin of the cdw phase in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 .",
    "the ground state properties are calculated using the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method for multiorbital systems  @xcite .",
    "we find that the cooperation between coulomb interaction and electron - phonon interaction is essential to induce the cdw phase .",
    "the cdw phase is observed between the normal metal and band insulator phases with intermediate interband coulomb interaction .",
    "we show that the `` pure '' exciton condensation without lattice distortion is difficult to realize under the poor fs nesting condition in a triangular lattice .",
    "furthermore , we systematically calculate the momentum resolved hybridization between the two bands to show that the strong - coupling bec - like pairing dominates in the cdw phase .",
    "our results therefore suggest that the cdw phase observed in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 originates from the strong - coupling bec - like electron - hole pairing .",

    "<S> to clarify the origin of a charge - density wave ( cdw ) phase in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 , we study the ground state property of a half - filled two - band hubbard model in a triangular lattice including electron - phonon interaction . by using the variational monte carlo method , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are both treated quantum mechanically on an equal footing beyond the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cooperation between coulomb interaction and electron - phonon interaction is essential to induce the cdw phase . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the `` pure '' exciton condensation without lattice distortion is difficult to realize under the poor nesting condition of the underlying fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by systematically calculating the momentum resolved hybridization between the two bands , we examine the character of electron - hole pairing from the viewpoint of bcs - bec crossover within the cdw phase and find that the strong - coupling bec - like pairing dominates . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose that the cdw phase observed in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 originates from a bec - like electron - hole pairing . </S>"
