    "relaying is central to wireless mesh and ad hoc networks , and is a potential enhancement for existing cellular networks .",
    "there is no `` wireless network '' without multi - hop communication , and thus , understanding the role and impact of different relaying techniques on wireless networks is of critical importance .",
    "there are multiple possible forwarding strategies that could be used by each relay node in the network , with the most popular ones being decode - and - forward , amplify - and - forward and quantize - and - forward .",
    "the forwarding strategy used at the relays and the resulting network capacity are inherently coupled , and it is not obvious which of the above forwarding strategies , if any , is information theoretically optimal for a particular network topology .",
    "for a few settings , amplify - and - forward has been shown to be better than decode - and - forward @xcite , and for a few others , partial decode - and - forward has been shown to be optimal @xcite .",
    "other than purely information - theoretic rate calculations , there are practical reasons for the use of amplify / quantize - and - forward strategy . decoding a packet at the relay",
    "requires an entire receive chain ( demodulation and decoding ) to be implemented at the relay , along with an entire transmit chain ( re - encode , remodulate and retransmit ) .",
    "an amplify / quantize - and - forward relay can bypass this chain , processing the received signal directly to obtain the relay output . this",
    "simplification greatly impacts the cost , energy usage and size of the relays , and therefore , it is not surprising that the majority of the relays used in practice today are based on amplify - and - forward strategy .",
    "also , in practice , amplify - and - forward is at par with decode - and - forward strategy with reduced complexity in processing @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to understand the stability region of relay networks employing amplify - and - forward scheme .    for non - cooperative relaying , there is a vast body of literature on optimal resource allocation in wireless networks @xcite ( and references therein ) . for cooperative relaying @xcite , the stability region of relay networks using decode - and",
    "- forward transmission has been studied in @xcite . in the decode - and - forward paradigm ,",
    "the queues still consist of conventional _ decoded data _ packets . in an amplify - and - forward relay network , each relay , however , observes an input sequence , whose `` rate '' is dependent on the state it was encoded for , which is not a conventional packet .",
    "there are three major differences between the amplify - and - forward relaying and conventional node - forwarding :    1 .",
    "each node in the network stores and ultimately forwards a real valued `` packet '' .",
    "this is accomplished by quantizing the received analog signal to some finite precision and storing it in a buffer .",
    "this stored signal is later retransmitted without further processing .",
    "the `` rate '' or effective bits per symbol of each real - valued `` packet '' is not the same , but variable depending on the encoding .",
    "a high - rate real - valued `` packet '' can only be forwarded when the channel can support the corresponding rate , i.e. , the channel state should _ match _ the `` packet '' rate , which is not required in the decode - and - forward scheme .",
    "we consider a four node relay network in this paper , and our main contributions include :    1 .",
    "we introduce a new queue - architecture to store the input sequences , which allows us to optimally exploit different states to do amplify - and - forward .",
    "we characterize the stability region of the four - node relay network under the amplify - and - forward , which in general is larger than that under the conventional amplify - and - forward scheme which does not allow signal buffering .",
    "we also propose a throughput - optimal algorithm , which achieves the stability region .",
    "an interesting and important property of our stabilizing algorithm is that it does not require the knowledge of the underlying distribution of the fading states .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the system model .",
    "section [ sec : rate ] provides an information - theoretic achievable rate for amplify - and - forward relaying .",
    "section [ sec : main ] presents the algorithm for throughput - optimal stable cooperative relaying over wireless networks for the four node example .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the proofs are stated in the appendix .",
    "our system model consists of a source , a destination and two relays as shown in figure [ fig : model ] . the relays",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 assist the source @xmath2 in transmitting to the destination @xmath3 through amplify - and - forward relaying .",
    "there is no direct link between the source and the destination .",
    "in addition , there is link activation constraint such that the links from the source to the relays and the links from the relays to the destination can not be active at the same time .",
    "this constraint arises from the following two system limitations : _ (",
    "i ) _ a relay can not receive and transmit simultaneously due to hardware limitations , and _",
    "( ii ) _ one of the relays ( say relay @xmath0 ) can not receive from the source at the same time as the other relay ( relay @xmath1 ) is transmitting to the destination . in essence , we assume that the transmissions of the two relays heavily interfere with each other .",
    "we consider a discrete time model for data transmission over the links .",
    "all the links undergo slow fading .",
    "further , we make the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "assumption 1 : there is coordination between the relays , i.e. , they transmit signals synchronously .",
    "2 .   assumption 2 : the fading process is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) block fading with block length of @xmath4 symbols . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath5 3 .",
    "assumption 3 : there is no power control over states .",
    "we consider an average power constraint of @xmath6 per block per node in the network , and additive gaussian noise of unit variance at each receiver in the network .",
    "to simplify notation , we denote the relays by @xmath7 , the wireless link between the source and the relay @xmath8 by @xmath9 , and the wireless link between the relay @xmath8 and the destination by @xmath10 .",
    "let the fading state of link @xmath9 be @xmath11 , and the fading state of link @xmath10 be @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are discrete non - negative random variables which take values from @xmath13 . in every block ,",
    "let the probability of the fading state @xmath14 \\in { \\cal{f}}^4 $ ] be @xmath15 .",
    "consider a given fading state @xmath16 .",
    "if the source transmits , then the received signals at the relays are @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the symbol transmitted from the source , and @xmath19 denotes the symbol received at the relay @xmath8 . if the relays transmit , then the received signal at the destination is @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the symbol transmitted from the relay @xmath8 , and @xmath22 denotes the symbol received at the destination . here ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean additive gaussian noise of unit variance at the relay @xmath8 and the destination .",
    "in the static case without any link activation constraint , amplify - and - forward commonly refers to the relaying scheme at the relays that transmit ( in every time slot ) scaled versions of the received signals in the previous time slot .",
    "the scaling parameters at the relays are determined as a function of the signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "these scaling parameters should also ensure that the average power constraints at the relays are satisfied . for the setting explained in the previous section , we look at an amplify - and - forward scheme ( denoted by af scheme ) in which the relays can transmit any of the previously received signal vectors or choose not to transmit .",
    "we assume that any received signal vector at the relays can be transmitted to the destination only once .",
    "we say that a symbol @xmath18 is transmitted by the source to the destination over state @xmath25\\in",
    "{ \\cal f}^4 $ ] , if the source transmits during a fading state of the form @xmath26 $ ] and the relays transmit during a fading state of the form @xmath27 $ ] . consider a symbol @xmath18 transmitted by the source to the destination over some state @xmath28 .",
    "let the average power used at the source be @xmath29 and at the relay @xmath8 be @xmath30 .",
    "these parameters are later optimized for the state @xmath28 . from ( [ y : relay ] ) , ( [ y : dest ] ) , the received symbol at the destination is @xmath31 + w_d,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 has zero mean and variance @xmath29 . from ( [ net_ch ] ) , it is straightforward to see that the maximum rate we can obtain is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34    the rate in ( [ rkl ] ) is equal to the maximum achievable rate using amplify - and - forward scheme in the static case with fixed channel state @xmath28 and full - duplex constraint @xcite .",
    "the power optimization in ( [ rkl ] ) will result in utilizing maximum power at the source and one of the relays .",
    "in general , the other relay will result in using lower power than the maximum available power@xcite .    for handling variable rate allocation ,",
    "we maintain separate virtual queues at each relay based on the possible rates of the real - valued `` packet '' .",
    "this is necessitated by the fact that encoding and decoding in amplify - and - forward relaying is an end - to - end process .",
    "thus , variable rate coding at the source depending on the state must be done to ensure that : _ ( i ) _ the virtual queues at the relays are stabilized , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the relays possess sufficient `` packets '' at variable rates for throughput optimal operation .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 $ ] the length of the virtual queue maintained for state @xmath28 , where @xmath25\\in { \\cal f}^4.$ ] note that when the system is in fading state @xmath36 for any state @xmath28 such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 a `` packet '' generated with rate @xmath39 can be successfully transmitted from the source to the relays ; and for any state @xmath28 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 a `` packet '' generated with rate @xmath39 can be successfully transmitted from the relays to the destination .",
    "we define @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the throughput region of the network is defined in the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : r ] a rate @xmath44 is supportable in the four - node relay network using an af scheme only if there exist @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 where @xmath15 is the probability that the system is in fading state @xmath16 and @xmath48 denotes the indicator function of event @xmath49 .",
    "when the system is in fading state @xmath36 the source can transmit one `` packet '' to any one virtual queue @xmath28 for which @xmath50 or the relays can transmit one `` packet '' in any one virtual queue @xmath51 to the destination for which @xmath52    let @xmath53 be the fraction of time the source transmits to virtual queue @xmath28 when the system is in fading state @xmath36 and @xmath54 be the fraction of time the relays transmit the `` packets '' in virtual queue @xmath28 to the destination when the system is in fading state @xmath16 .",
    "hence , inequality ( [ eq : overall ] ) says that the overall fraction should be no more than one .",
    "equality ( [ eq : fc1 ] ) is the flow conservation constrain for the source to all the virtual queues , and equality ( [ eq : fc2 ] ) is the flow conservation constrain for each individual virtual queue .",
    "the detailed proof is given in the appendix .",
    "we can obtain rates _ strictly _ greater than the average of rates over all fading states by asynchronously combining states between the source and the relays and the relays and the destination .",
    "we will demonstrate this using a simple example .",
    "let @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "consider the fading distribution such that fading states @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] occur with probabilities @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be considered as the probability of outage in this example .",
    "the rate corresponding to state @xmath60 $ ] alone is non - zero , which is @xmath67 . in this example , it is easy to observe that we can achieve @xmath68 bits / transmission with asynchronous combining of states whereas @xmath69 bits / transmission is the average of rates over different fading states .",
    "these achievable rates are plotted in figure [ fig : comp ] .",
    "we consider an i.i.d .",
    "arrival process @xmath70 $ ] for the data bits at the source @xmath2 with mean rate @xmath71 and bounded variance .",

    "we will show that this queue - architecture at the relays can be utilized to obtain a throughput - optimal algorithm .",
    "in this section , we provide an algorithm , based on back - pressure @xcite which is throughput - optimal , and that does not require the knowledge of the fading distribution .",
