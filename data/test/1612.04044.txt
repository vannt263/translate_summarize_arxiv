    "since 1919 @xcite , experimental confirmations of the theory of general relativity @xcite by measuring the gravitational bending of light by the sun have been done .",
    "the gravitational bending of light by other astronomical objects has been observed at many times .",
    "the gravitational lensing has been well established as one of the powerful tools in astronomy and cosmology .",
    "the gravitational bending of light plays an important role also in the theoretical study of gravity , for example on a null structure of a spacetime .",
    "hagihara found the analytical solution for light trajectories in the gravitational field of schwarzschild @xcite , where the expressions involve incomplete elliptic integrals of the first kind .",
    "see @xcite for exact solutions for the light trajectory in schwarzschild and some other black hole solutions .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a review on the light deflection in the weak - field approximation of schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "a generalized lens equation for the light deflection in schwarzschild metric in the weak - field approximation and valid for finite distances of source and observer from the lens was discussed by zschocke @xcite .    in order to understand a strong gravitational field ,",
    "a more rigorous formulation of the bending angle has been investigated @xcite .",
    "for instance , strong - field gravitational lensing in a schwarzschild black hole was investigated by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite , by virbhadra and ellis @xcite and more comprehensively by virbhadra @xcite ; distinctive lensing features of naked singularities were studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "kitamura , nakajima and asada proposed a lens model in the inverse powers of the distance as @xmath2 @xcite , such that the schwarzschild lens , the ellis wormhole lens and a gravitational lens associated with exotic matter ( or energy ) that might follow a non - standard equation of state can be discussed in a unified manner of describing these models as a one parameter family @xcite .",
    "see also tsukamoto et al .",
    "( 2015 ) @xcite for a possible connection between this inverse power model and the tangherlini solution to the higher - dimensional einstein equation .",
    "gibbons and werner ( 2008 ) proposed an alternative way of deriving the deflection angle of light @xcite .",
    "they used the gauss - bonnet theorem to a spatial domain described by the optical metric , where they assumed that the source and receiver are located at an asymptotic region . by extending gibbons and werner s idea , ishihara et al .",
    "have recently investigated finite - distance corrections @xcite .",
    "however , such works @xcite are limited within the small deflection limit .    since the pioneering work by darwin @xcite , on the other hand , the strong deflection limit has attracted a lot of interests ( see e.g. @xcite ) , mainly because we expect that the recent progress in astronomical instruments will soon enable us to detect such strong deflection phenomena .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of the present paper is to extend the earlier work @xcite , especially in order to examine finite - distance corrections in the strong deflection limit .",

    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the angles that are measured at the receiver position ( r ) and the source position ( s ) , respectively .",

    "from the three angles @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 , let us define @xcite @xmath29    eq.([alpha ] ) has a geometrically invariant meaning as follows @xcite .",

    "the sign of the line element is chosen such that it is compatible with the orientation of the surface .",
    "let us consider a quadrilateral @xmath39 , which consists of the spatial curve for the light ray , two outgoing radial lines from r and from s and a circular arc segment @xmath40 of coordinate radius @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) centered at the lens which intersects the radial lines through the receiver or the source .",

    "henceforth , we restrict ourselves within the asymptotically flat spacetime , for which @xmath43 and @xmath44 as @xmath42 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "( [ orbiteq ] ) .",
    "next , we consider another case that the distance from the source to the receiver is finite because every observed stars and galaxies are located at finite distance from us ( e.g. , at finite redshift in cosmology ) and the distance is much larger than the size of the lens .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the inverse of @xmath6 and @xmath57 , respectively , where @xmath6 and @xmath57 are finite .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath58",
    "in the previous section for the weak deflection , a spatial curve from the source to the receiver is simple . in the strong deflection limit , however , a spatial curve from the source to the receiver may have a winding number that can exceed unity .",
    "therefore , the spatial curve may have intersection points .",
    "we split the curve into pieces , such that each of the pieces can have no intersection .",
    "we begin with the case of one loop for its simplicity .",
    "please see figure [ fig - oneloop ] .",
    "first , we examine the two quadrilaterals ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in figure [ fig - oneloop2 ] , which can be constructed by imagining an auxiliary point ( p ) that may be the periastron and then by assuming auxiliary outgoing radial lines ( solid line in the figure ) from the point p in the quadrilaterals ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . in fact , it does not matter that the point p is chosen as the periastron .",
    "note that the direction of the two auxiliary lines in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is opposite and thus the two auxiliary lines cancel out to make no contributions to @xmath47 in the sum of the quadrilaterals ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the inner angle at the point p in the quadrilateral ( 1 ) and that in the quadrilateral ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath61 , because the line from the source to the receiver is a geodesic curve and the point p lies on the geodesic .    for each orientable quadrilateral in figure [ fig - oneloop2 ] , the method in the previous section can be applied as it is . in the similar manner to deriving eq .",
    "( [ alpha - k ] ) , we obtain @xmath62 where the coordinate angle difference @xmath28 is split into two parts , @xmath63 for the quadrilateral ( 1 ) and @xmath64 for the other quadrilateral ( 2 ) .    if @xmath65 , then , there is a reflection symmetry between the quadrilaterals ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and @xmath66 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath63 does not always equal to @xmath64 . in any case , however , @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath68 are the inner angles at @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , where we should remember that @xmath25 is an angle measured from the outgoing radial line .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath71 where we use @xmath61 and @xmath67 .",
    "this result takes the same form as eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , but we should note that it is derived for one loop case .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath74 where we use @xmath75 . while eq .",
    "( [ alpha-2loop ] ) is derived for the two - loop case , it reveals again the form of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "note that one loop , from which the quadrilaterals ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be constructed , makes the contribution to @xmath47 only in terms of @xmath76 .    finally , we consider any winding number @xmath77 .",

    "( [ alpha ] ) , which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ alpha - finite ] ) by using the orbit equation , is rearranged as @xmath84    the finite - distance correction to the deflection angle of light , denoted as @xmath85 , is the difference between the asymptotic deflection angle and the deflection angle for the finite distance case .",

    "the other origin is the two path integrals , one from the receiver position to the spatial infinity and the other from the source to the infinity .",
    "therefore , if both the receiver and the source are in the weak field region as is common in astronomy , the finite - distance correction comes only from the weak field region but not from the strong field region , even if the light ray passes near the photon sphere @xmath90 , where @xmath91 denotes the photon sphere radius .",
    "this is quite reasonable .      as a concrete example ,",
    "henceforth , we focus on the schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath92 .",
    "then , eq . ( [ f ] ) becomes @xmath93    eq .",
    "( [ alpha - full ] ) with @xmath53 given by eq .",

    "( [ alpha - full ] ) . here",

    "( [ alpha - approx ] ) .",
    "see appendix for more details .    as stated above , it is natural that the logarithmic term due to the strong field is independent of finite - distance corrections such as a multiplication by @xmath97 . by chance , @xmath85 for the strong deflection limit ( see eq .",
    "( [ alpha - full ] ) ) is the same as that for the weak deflection case ( see e.g. eq . ( 29 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the finite - distance correction for the strong deflection limit is of the same order as @xmath98 for the weak field case ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the correction is linear in the impact parameter .",
    "this implies that the finite - distance correction for the weak deflection case ( large @xmath99 ) is larger than that in the strong deflection limit ( small @xmath99 ) , if the other parameters are fixed . in the next section",
    ", we shall discuss in more detail .",
    "we assume that an observer at the earth sees the light bending by the solar mass , while the source is practically at the asymptotic region . if the light ray passes near the solar surface , eq .",
    "( [ order - alpha ] ) implies that the finite - distance correction to this case is of the order of @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 denotes the solar radius .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ alpha - sun ] ) comes from eq .",
    "( 29 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for the weak - field limit and therefore it is independent of eq .",
    "( [ alpha - approx ] ) for the strong deflection limit .",
    "this correction of @xmath1 arcsec .",
    "( @xmath103 micro arcseconds ) , is close to the angular accuracy within the capability of near - future astronomy .",
    "for instance , a current astrometry space mission gaia @xcite and a future one jasmine ( japan astrometry satellite mission for infrared exploration ) @xcite are expected to approach nearly ten micro arcseconds , though the solar direction is too bright and even dangerous for these telescopes . in order to measure the above finite - distance correction , a specially dedicated instrument such as a corona graph might be needed or a total solar eclipse for an astrometry satellite could be used along the original idea by arthur eddington .",
    "figure [ fig - sun ] shows numerical calculations of the bending angle of light due to the finite distance of the receiver .",
    "these analytic and numerical results , eq .",
    "( [ alpha - sun ] ) and figure @xmath104 , are consistent with each other and they suggest that @xmath85 by the solar mass might not be negligible in future astrometry observations .",
    "note that the above correction happens to be comparable to the deflection of light at the second post - newtonian order .",
    "if a 2pn test of the light bending by the sun is done in the future , therefore , the above correction might be relevant .",
    "next , we consider the strong deflection limit .",
    "one of the most plausible candidates for the strong deflection is at the center of our galaxy .",
    "it is identified with sgr a@xmath0 . in this case , the receiver distance is much larger than the impact parameter of light , while a source star may be in the central region of our galaxy .    for sgr a@xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ order - alpha ] ) implies @xmath105 where we assume the mass of the central black hole as @xmath106 and the strong deflection limit as @xmath107",
    ". this angle might be reachable in near - future astronomy",
    ".    please see figure [ fig - sgr ] for numerical calculations of the finite - distance correction due to the source location .",
    "this figure and also eq .",
    "( [ alpha - sgr ] ) suggest that @xmath85 can be of the order of ten ( or more ) micro arcseconds , if a source star is sufficiently close to sgr a@xmath0 , for instance within a tenth of one parsec from sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "in other words , for such a close source case , even though the source is still in the weak field , the infinite - distance limit is no longer sufficient .",
    "we have to take account of finite - distance corrections that are proposed in this paper .",
    "for a static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime , we used the gauss - bonnet theorem to show that eq .",
    "( [ alpha - full ] ) gives the exact bending angle of light especially by taking account of the finite distance from a lens object to a light source and a receiver , such that the definition can be valid also in the strong deflection limit .",
    "finally , this method was applied to schwarzschild spacetime as a concrete example .",
    "we discussed also possible observational implications .",
    "the proposed finite - distance corrections for sgr a@xmath0 for instance are able to amount to @xmath1 arcseconds for a limited parameter range , which may be within the scope of near - future astronomy .",
    "also the finite - distance correction to the sun is @xmath1 arcseconds , while this case is in the weak - field limit",
