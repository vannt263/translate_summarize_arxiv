    "the starting point lies with the narrow absorption lines ( nals)/x - ray warm absorbers in the well - studied seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 . accepting for a moment the identity of the uv and x - ray absorbers ,",
    "then the absorber must lie @xmath010@xmath1  cm from the continuum source , but is only @xmath010@xmath2  cm thick ; i.e. a thin shell .",
    "( this is also needed to have a single ionization state fit the data . )",
    "this shell has an outward velocity of 1200  km  s@xmath3 ( figure  1 ) , yet in 20 years has not changed its ionization state .",
    "( being a trace ion , n(civ ) should have increased by a factor 100 , unless density changes precisely matched the declining ionizing continuum , yet the civ ew has been constant . ) mathur , elvis & wilkes ( 1995 ) explained this constancy by invoking a flow of absorbing material across our line of sight to the continuum .",
    "so the structure remained constant , although the particular gas atoms changed .",
    "a flow across the line of sight implies a conical structure ( figure  1c ) , so from some directions no absorbers will be seen . a cone angle of 60@xmath4 divides the solid angle equally , and could explain why half of seyfert galaxies have ionized absorbers and half do not ( figures  3a , b ) .",
    "there is a third viewing direction : directly down the flow .",
    "this too will show a highly ionized absorber , but with much larger column density and higher velocity .",
    "recent work on broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars suggests that they have such conditions ( e.g. mathur , elvis & singh 1996 ; hamman 1998 ) .",
    "if the flow opens at a half angle of 6@xmath4 then 10% of agn will be seen as bal quasars , as observed .",
    "this is appealing since both warm absorber outflows ( see above ) and bals are likely present in all quasars ( to explain , among other reasons , the strong continuum polarization in bal troughs , ogle 1998 ) .",
    "however the velocities in bals are @xmath010 times those of the nals .",
    "the simplest modification to figure  1 that accomodates this is to bend the flow ( figure  2 , figure  3a ) . at first glance",
    "this geometry appears unlikely ; however , it can arise quite naturally .",
    "symmetry requires that a disk wind will first rise vertically .",
    "once exposed to radiation pressure from the continuum source the flow will begin to bend outward , giving the @xmath01000  km  s@xmath3 nal outflow velocity , and will become radial when @xmath5 .",
    "the ` detachment velocities ' of bals measure this critical velocity to be 0 - 5000  km  s@xmath3 , so @xmath6 , the disk orbital velocity at the wind ejection point .",
    "conditions in the ` warm ' absorber are likely to be high density ( @xmath710@xmath8@xmath9 ) , and truly warm ( @xmath010@xmath10k , nicastro et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) , hence the name ` warm highly ionized medium ' ( whim ) .",
    "the whim pressure is comparable with that in broad emission - line clouds .",
    "the geometry removes the objection that a belr confining medium would be compton thick , while the bulk co - outflowing of both whim and belr means that the belr clouds will not be destroyed by shear forces .",
    "in addition : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , about 10@xmath1 cm in ngc  5548 .",
    "the cylinder / cone geometry of the wind naturally divides the belr into a high ionization ( cylindrical ) region , and a low ionization ( conical ) region shielded from x - rays by the whim .",
    "along the flow ( in the bal direction ) the whim is compton thick .",
    "scattering from the rear of the flow ( figure  3c ) produces the polarized continuum in bals ( ogle 1998 ) .",
    "compton thick scatterers are also needed to make : ` polarized bel ' seyfert  2s ( e.g. ngc  1068 ) ; uv continuum polarization below ly@xmath13 ( beloborodov & poutanen 1999 ) ; and the x - ray reflection features , the ` compton hump ' and fluorescent fe - k line .",
    "could these could arise from the whim ?",
    "the uv continuum polarization needs semi - relativistic outflow , which the conical bal part of the wind has .",
    "the ` polarized bel ' might work if there is dust in the outer part of the wind .",
    "( if this happens only in low luminosity agn , then the missing ` quasar  2s ' are the bal quasars . )",
    "however hst has resolved some of the ` mirrors ' in seyfert  2s on @xmath010  parsec scales , too large to be the whim .",
    "the whim will necessarily produce x - ray features , proportional to the whim covering factor of 10% 30% , i.e. almost half the observed fe - k line strength .",
    "the whim fe - k component can not vary on timescales @xmath14 weeks .",
    "high luminosity quasars differ from the lower luminosity agn in several features .",
    "changes in the outflow opening angle and the height of the cylindrical region , e.g. from increased radiation or cosmic ray pressure at high luminosities , may explain : the lower civ ew ( baldwin effect ) , the rarity of nals , and the weakness of x - ray scattering features in high luminosity quasars .",
    "the need for an ` obscuring torus ' is weaker in this model : ( 1 ) the seyfert  2s with polarized bels could be viewed through a dusty bal ; ( 2 ) the conical shell outflow could itself produce the bi - cone structures , which would then be hollow , matter bounded , cones rather than filled , ionization bounded , structures ; ( 3 ) the more common ` no polarized bel ' seyfert  2s could be made in several ways ( lawrence & elvis 1982 ) .",
    "the complete structure proposed here and in elvis ( 2000 ) is shown in figure  4 .",
    "this ambitious proposal draws together a number of previously disparate areas of quasar research into a single simple scheme . the broad and narrow absorption line (",
    "bal , nal ) regions , the high and low ionization broad emission line regions ( belr ) , and at least some of the five compton thick scattering regions can all be combined into the single funnel - shaped outflow , while on large scales this outflow could produce the bi - conical narrow emission line regions .",
    "this unification gives the model a certain appeal ."
