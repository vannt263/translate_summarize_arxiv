    "the granular character of many processes in nature has motivated the study of granular materials and in particular granular packings since kepler s time@xcite .",
    "one of such processes is the deposition of particles subject to gravity@xcite , which underlies the formation of sandstones , ceramics and in general , the emergence of porous materials .",
    "modelling porous media@xcite in a realistic way is important for instance to understand permeability of soils for petroleum engineering or in material sciences .",
    "however , a model for grain deposition should incorporate two ingredients not always easy to combine .",
    "first , empirical studies@xcite show that the shape of grains significantly deviates from the sphere with a non - negligible polydispersity in their sizes . until recently most computational studies dealt with round particles for simplicity , in solving specific problems such as obtaining the optimal packing@xcite , constructing space - filling configurations@xcite or studying elongated shapes@xcite .",
    "some progress was recently made when addressing the influence of particle shape on the macroscopic observables of the agglomerate , focusing on ellipsoidal particles@xcite and even in more general shapes@xcite , without accounting for the size polydispersity .",
    "second , deposition processes are fundamentally sequential and therefore should be modelled through sequential procedures . the procedure introduced by donev _",
    "et al_@xcite for jammed configurations , captures some of the general features observed in granular deposits , such as their density and average coordination number , although it is based on a non - sequential procedure .",
    "however , deposition under gravity does not generally lead to a jammed state .",
    "recently , some sequential procedures were already carried out in two - dimensional deposits of mono - disperse elongated particles@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on three - dimensional polydisperse deposits of general ellipsoids and study how macroscopic properties of such deposits depend on the shape and size polydispersity of particles .",
    "we show that the density and coordination number of deposits behaves similarly to what is observed in jammed systems .",
    "however , in contrast with randomly constructed jammed systems , deposits become strongly anisotropic when the shape of the particles deviate from the sphere .",
    "furthermore , we find that the size polydispersity plays a minor role when compared to the shape .    to this end , we develop an efficient algorithm for the calculation of the interactions forces at all contact points within a three - dimensional deposits of polydisperse ellipsoids and use it in a molecular dynamics@xcite method to perform our simulations .",
    "further , we introduce two shape parameters which describe any ellipsoid , enabling a systematic study of the role of particle shape in granular deposits .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the algorithm for calculating the contact forces between colliding ellipsoids with arbitrary size and shape as well as the simulation setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : controlparam ] the control parameters describing the polydispersity in the size and the shape of a general ellipsoid are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : macroprop ] the dependency of macroscopic observables taken from the entire deposit are studied as functions of the control parameters .",
    "we focus on the density , coordination number and anisotropy of the deposits .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "when dealing with large systems , calculating the inter - particle forces is by far the most time consuming part of the computations .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in general , every particle can interact with every other one . in granular materials , however , the inter - particle forces are short range making techniques such as verlet list and linked - cell algorithm indispensable in reducing the computation time .",
    "these technique are employed to eliminate the redundant calculations for pairs which are too far apart to have any interaction@xcite .    in time - driven molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "methods of granular materials the system is evolved for one time step allowing the particles to overlap",
    ". then normal repulsion forces on the particles are calculated as a function of the amount of overlapping , which is defined usually by a line segment . here",
    "we refer to this line segment as the contact vector ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contact ] ) .    the contact vector between two ellipsoids can be defined in more than one way .",
    "the common method , introduced by perram and co - workers@xcite and developed by others@xcite , is based on finding two points , one on the surface of each ellipsoid by minimizing a potential through a variational problem with one geometric constraint .",
    "the two obtained points can be used to define the contact vector .",
    "however , the contact vector defined this way is not necessarily normal to the surface of the particles , particularly when particles are strongly asymmetrical , leading to non - physical motions of the particles .",
    "an alternative method consists in finding two points on the surfaces of the ellipsoids at which the corresponding surface normals point exactly in opposite directions .",
    "consequently , the vector connecting these two points is normal to the surfaces of both ellipsoids and can be used as a well - defined contact vector .",
    "this method is , however , much more computationally expensive than the former one .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "to retain the computational efficiency , we use the former method and introduce an additional step for correcting the direction of the contact vector .     used to define the normal repulsive force between two overlapping ellipsoids @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the contact point is chosed to be @xmath2 after properly deriving points @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the surfaces of the ellipsoids ( see text ) .",
    "the full procedure is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the geometric potential of the ellipsoid @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the cartesian coordinates of a point on the surface and the centroid of the ellipsoid , respectively .",
    "the equation @xmath8 describes the surface of ellipsoid @xmath0 . considering a pair of ellipsoids @xmath9 and @xmath10 , two minimum points @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are found on the surfaces of @xmath0 and @xmath10 by minimizing @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "these points are shown schematically in fig.[fig : contact ] . to obtain the minima of @xmath13 subject to the constrain of being on the surface of ellipsoid @xmath1",
    "we minimize the following auxiliary potential : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the constrain . setting to zero the gradient of this function with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath16 we obtain an equation for _ optimum _ points @xmath17 for @xmath0 :",
    "@xmath18    to derive an equation for @xmath15 we left - multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrange ] ) by @xmath19 and use the fact that @xmath17 lies on @xmath1 and that the gradients of the potential functions of the ellipsoids at _ minimum _ point are in opposite directions : @xmath20 equations ( [ eq : min ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) can be solved iteratively to find @xmath21 up to the desired precision . the second point @xmath22 can be found similarly .",
    "the contact point @xmath2 where a contact force is exerted on both ellipsoids is defined as the midpoint between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the contact vector for ellipsoid @xmath0 is defined as @xmath23 and for ellipsoid @xmath1 , @xmath24 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contact ] ) .    although eq .",
    "( [ eq : min ] ) involves inversion of a @xmath25-matrix , finding the minima can be very efficient by choosing the initial points properly .",
    "good approximations for minima are the minima from the last time step or , if the ellipsoids were disjoint in the last time step , the closest points on the surfaces of the ellipsoids which are known from collision detection procedure described later in this section .",
    "these points are then used as initial points , reducing the number of iterations significantly .    the overlapping vector calculated in this way , however , is not necessarily normal to the ellipsoids at the contact point .",
    "in fact , the normal directions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 at points @xmath3 and @xmath4 deviate significantly from each other when the particles are strongly aspherical . to overcome this problem",
    "we introduce an additional step for correcting the contact vector , as described next .",
    "if the calculated contact vectors deviate more than a given amount from the gradients of the ellipsoid s potential at the contact point @xmath2 , a new direction is calculated by averaging the gradients at @xmath2 .",
    "then , two new points are calculated from the intersection of the line along this direction passing through the contact point .",
    "these new points are used to define a new contact vector .",
    "although it is not generally possible to define a vector which is along the gradients of both ellipsoids at the contact point , this approximation gives satisfactory results in terms of energy conservation .",
    "having described the procedure for calculating the contact of two colliding ellipsoids , we next need an efficient way to determine when two previously disjoint ellipsoids collide . to this end",
    ", we use the technique proposed by wang _ et al_@xcite which is described briefly as follows .    in",
    "homogeneous coordinates the equation for the surface of a general ellipsoid is given by @xmath26 where @xmath6 is any point on the surface of the ellipsoid and @xmath27 is the @xmath28-matrix of the affine transformation which transforms the unit sphere centered at the origin into the ellipsoid",
    ".        given two ellipsoids @xmath29 and @xmath30 , their characteristic equation is defined as @xmath31 , whose roots are the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown @xcite that ( i ) @xmath33 has at least two negative roots , ( ii ) @xmath33 has two distinct positive roots if and only if the two ellipsoids are disjoint , ( iii ) @xmath33 has a positive double root if and only if the two ellipsoids are externally touching .",
    "therefore , by examining the eigenvalues of @xmath34 it can be determined if two ellipsoids collide .",
    "when the ellipsoids are disjoint , the corresponding eigenvectors give the coordinates of the four vertices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , of a tetrahedron which is self - polar for both ellipsoids @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite , i.e.  @xmath37 .",
    "two of the vertices lie outside both ellipsoids ( external vertices ) , while the other two are contained inside the ellipsoids , one in each ( internal vertices ) . in this case , a set of separation planes can be defined using three points exterior to both ellipsoids , two of them being the external vertices and the other a point on the line segment connecting the internal vertices .",
    "we choose the third point as the midpoint between the surfaces of two ellipsoids on this line segment .    having the separation plane between the two disjoint ellipsoids , in the subsequent time step we check if the ellipsoids intersect that plane .",
    "if not , the ellipsoids are still disjoint and the procedure stops .",
    "this helps to eliminate the need for checking for collision between the ellipsoids which is more computationally expensive . only when any of the ellipsoids intersects the separation plane it is necessary to check again for the collision between the ellipsoids .",
    "if the ellipsoids turn out to be still disjoint their separation plane and closest points are updated to be used in the next time step .",
    "if the ellipsoids do collide the contact vector is calculated and saved to be used for the calculation of the contact force .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram ] shows the flow - chart of the complete procedure which is performed for all potentially overlapping pairs of ellipsoids .",
    "it is worth noting that , to further speed up the procedure , only the pairs whose spherical envelopes intersect are evaluated .",
    "the contact force can be decomposed to normal and tangential forces .",
    "the tangential forces such as static and dynamical frictions are generally derived from the normal force . for calculating the magnitude of the normal force we use hertzian model@xcite : @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the length of the contact vector between the particles and @xmath40 being the dissipative constant depending on the material viscosity @xcite .",
    "since we are only concerned with the properties of the deposit at rest , we choose @xmath40 sufficiently large for the deposit to relax rapidly .",
    "this relaxation is enhanced by including a tangential force @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the dynamic friction coefficient and @xmath43 the relative tangent velocity of the particles .    finally , the procedure described above is used in a md simulation together with standard methods , namely a prediction - correction integrator for solving the equations of motions , quaternions for describing the orientation of the particles and linked - cell algorithm to eliminate unnecessary collision detections . for details of the md methods see e.g.  ref .",

    "the size and shape of the particles are the main parameters whose effects on the properties of the system are to be studied . in the following",

    "note that the curves are symmetric with respect to @xmath99 because for each contact normal of a particle there is a contact normal with opposite direction from the other particle to which it is in contact .",
    "the results show that for deposits of spheres the distribution @xmath100 is independent of @xmath95 , and consequently the configuration of the contacts is isotropic and has no preferred direction .",
    "however , as the shape of the particles deviates from a sphere the number of side contacts between particles , i.e.  the number of contacts on the horizontal plane , decreases and the contact normals line up along the vertical direction .",

    "in this work , we studied systematically the static properties of deposits composed of ellipsoidal particles of different size and shape , focusing on their density and anisotropy .",
    "to this end , we developed an efficient molecular dynamics method for simulation of ellipsoidal particles which we used to generate deposits of such particles under gravity .",
    "for mono - sized particles , the density increases rapidly as the shape of the particles deviates from a sphere , reaching for particular values of the shape parameters a maximum significantly higher than the one observed in random close packing of spheres . with increasing further the shape parameters , that is , deviating further for a sphere density to decrease slowly .",
    "the densities observed in the deposits are generally lower than the ones obtained through procedures for optimal packings .",

    "such observations point toward the possibility for using deposition of ellipsoids as a proper procedure for modeling porous media .",
    "this is the subject of future works .    in the case of polydisperse particles",
    "the density takes higher values with qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "a rather unexpected result is that the polydispersity in the sizes of the particles has almost no effect on the anisotropic behavior of the system .",
