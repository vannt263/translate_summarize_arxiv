    "the directionality of the wimp event rate is due to the motion of the sun with respect to the galactic halo .",
    "we are moving towards the constellation cygnus and hence the nuclear recoils are expected to be strongly peaked in the direction opposite to this . the strength of the signal is expected to be large ; an anisotropic set of recoils can be discriminated from isotropic backgrounds with as few as 10 events  @xcite , while the peak recoil direction can be measured , and the galactic origin of the scattering particle confirmed , with around @xmath1 events  @xcite .",
    "practically directional detection is still in its early stages , with a number of prototype detectors in the process of development .",

    "directional detection offers several theoretical advantages over its non - directional counterpart .",
    "firstly and foremost , there are no known backgrounds able to mimic the wimp signal in its characteristic peak direction .",
    "furthermore it offers the only prospect for constraining the local _ velocity _ distribution of the dark matter .",
    "the dependence of the experimental signals on the form of the local wimp velocity distribution has attracted a lot of attention in the literature , as there is significant uncertainty in the form of the velocity distribution , and the parameters on which it depends ( for a review see ref .",
    "data from direct detection experiments are typically compared using the standard halo model ( shm ) , for which the velocity distribution is an isotropic maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the shape of the true local velocity distribution is expected to depart significantly from this simple model  @xcite .",
    "however the use of the shm is at least somewhat justified for several reasons .",
    "firstly there is no fully agreed upon alternative parametrisation of the velocity distribution and secondly the expected deviations from the shm are unlikely to affect the analysis of data from the _ current _ generation of non - directional detectors , provided the free parameters are appropriately marginalised over  @xcite .    nevertheless , results from n - body and hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation show deviations from the putative smooth and isotropic shm , including tidal streams  @xcite , a dark disk  @xcite and debris flows  @xcite , which could be detectable by future experiments . in this paper",
    "we focus on substructure in the form of tidal streams , which result from the disruption of sub - halos accreted by the milky way .",
    "there are hints that such a feature may pass through the solar neighbourhood .",
    "a contiguous group of stars moving with a common velocity , that are possibly part of a tidal tail from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , have been observed nearby  @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been argued that the dark matter content of the stream is likely to be significantly more extended than the stellar content and to have an offset of as much as a few kpc  @xcite .",

    "the deviation from the smooth halo event rate is sharper and larger in size for lighter wimps .      to study the detectability of a stream we simulate mock experiments by monte carlo generating nuclear recoils . to do this we build the velocity flux distribution , sample velocities from this distribution , and",

    "the dispersion of the stream has no effect on the performance of the test , because , for dispersions of at most tens of @xmath156 , the wimps scatter into the same angular area independent of the dispersion .",
    "the significance achieved decreases weakly as the escape speed is increased .",
    "this is because increasing the escape speed does nt affect the recoils from stream wimps , but slightly increases the number of recoils from the smooth halo .",

    "the lowest energy recoils are those which scatter through the largest angles .",
    "removing the low energy recoils from the signal by increasing the threshold energy thus removes the stream wimps scattering furthest from the peak stream direction .",

    "[ testcompare_sagit ] , the performance of the median direction test is weakened compared to the kuiper test under the removal of these low energy recoils .",
    "the performance of the tests also depends on the mass of the wimp , due mainly to the variation in the total wimp scattering rate . as shown in fig .",
    "[ r_m_chi ] , typically higher mass wimps yield fewer events ( assuming fixed exposure and local density @xmath11 ) and hence the significance achieved by the tests decreases with increasing wimp mass .",

    "as mentioned previously , the stream velocity can be described by two parameters , the speed of the stream , @xmath158 , and the angle between the lab and stream velocities , @xmath159 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ deltatheta ] ) .",
    "figure [ testcomparison_deltatheta ] shows how the significance varies with the stream direction and speed , and also the energy window of the detector .",
    "the tests do not perform equally for all stream directions .",
    "in particular the tests return a low significance when the stream is anti - aligned with the solar velocity , as in this case the null hypotheses of rotational symmetry and inverse - solar median direction are in fact correct .",
    "the number of events from stream wimps plays an important role in determining the significance which can be achieved , and for streams with small @xmath160 this number is very low and for low streams speeds or high threshold energies it can even be zero .",
    "the symmetry in the plots is due to this dependence on both the sample size and the positioning of the stream recoils with respect to the smooth halo recoils . for the fastest streams , increasing the threshold energy results in a higher significance ,",
    "this is essentially a background rejection effect ; it preferentially removes low energy smooth halo recoils and the stream is more prominent , even with fewer overall events .",
    "the drop - off at large @xmath160 for the [ 5 , 50 ] kev window is due to the stream being boosted so that a portion of the recoils fall above the energy window .",
    "this is the reverse effect to that at low values of @xmath160 in the [ 20 , 100 ] kev window , in this case the stream recoils lie below the threshold energy .",
    "the kuiper and median direction tests studied in this section only use the direction of the recoils and not their energies . as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , use of the full energy and direction data allows better constraints to be placed on the wimp speed distribution . it may be possible to improve the tests we have studied by incorporating the energy dependence of the signal by performing the test successively on energy ordered recoils or by binning the recoils in energy . in the case where there is no stream present the hypotheses of rotational symmetry and inverse - solar median direction are satisfied for all energies",
    "however with a stream in the signal there will be a range of energies where the hypothesis is false .",
    "the degree to which the test is failed will initially increase with energy and then above a certain value , determined by the stream speed , the test would return a value closer to the null case . accounting for this effect in the test statistic would decrease the overlap between the null and alternative distributions and hence increase the significance of a particular result .",
    "however it is likely to be a small effect , in fig .",
    "[ energyspectrum ] one can see that the energy dependent effect of a stream is quite small and highly dependent on mass .",
    "furthermore splitting the recoils in energy would result in a smaller number of events , and hence a loss of information , for each individual evaluation of the test statistic .",
    "therefore it is likely that such a modified energy dependent non - parametric test would perform no better than the standard direction - only non - parametric tests we have studied , given the low numbers of recoils expected .",
    "we now turn our attention towards statistical tests capable of placing constraints on the properties of substructure present in the local dark matter velocity distribution as well as distinguishing between the halo and halo+stream models . for placing constraints on the parameters of the model we use bayesian inference , whereas the test that is most appropriate for model comparison is a profile likelihood ratio test , as it uses the assumption that the null hypothesis is obtained by applying a constraint to the alternative hypothesis .",
    "the likelihood ratio test has the added advantage of being able to conveniently account for astrophysical uncertainties by treating them as nuisance parameters  @xcite .",
    "the model we describe has 11 free parameters , @xmath161 , where we split the velocity of the stream into its three galactic co - ordinate components . for simplicity we will again assume the smooth component of the halo has a mb distribution , but in principle the approach could be used with other velocity distributions e.g. the form of mao et al .",

    "this can be overcome , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by treating @xmath43 as a nuisance parameter and accounting for its uncertainty by hand by including an additional multiplicative term to the likelihood in the form of a gaussian with mean and standard deviation of @xmath178 km s@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the wimp density , @xmath11 , and cross section , @xmath85 , are also difficult to constrain as they only appear in the amplitude of the recoil spectrum and hence only affect the number of events seen for a given exposure . even for the quite large stream densities that we are considering here the difference between",
    "the number of events in the stream case and in the null case is small .",
    "moreover , the two parameters are degenerate with one another meaning there is no single set of values for @xmath11 and @xmath85 that maximise the likelihood function .",
    "therefore we also employ a gaussian contribution to the likelihood function for @xmath11 with mean and standard deviation @xmath179 gev @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "whilst the questions that we are trying to address are frequentist in nature , there is much to be gained from parameter estimation by bayesian inference .",
    "we can test this approach by reconstructing the input parameters used to generate a set of mock data , again initially studying the example case of a sagittarius - like stream and a @xmath180 wimp , using the same benchmark parameters and experimental configuration as in sec .",

    "we use a flat prior with ranges indicated by the axes of fig .",

    "the effect of the gaussian parametrisation of @xmath43 and @xmath11 is apparent and equivalent to using a gaussian prior .",
    "there is a still some correlation in the @xmath188 plane but the degeneracy is broken .",

    "we have shown that good constraints can be placed on the parameters describing a stream , if the correct model is used in constructing the likelihood function for the data .",
    "importantly , we note that the exposure times needed to make these constraints @xmath189 kg yr are significantly shorter than are needed when the non - parametric directional tests are used .",
    "our results agree with a similar work by lee and peter  @xcite .",
    "they likewise found that the constraints improved with the use of the full energy and direction information , however they used a different parameterisation , subsuming the degenerate local density and cross section into a single parameter , fixing the total number of wimp and background events and normalising out the amplitude of the signal . here , in order to achieve independence under changing halo , wimp and experimental parameters , we quote exposure time and not total number of events and must parameterise the likelihood function with local density and cross section and also use the background rate @xmath83 as an input parameter .",
    "we now turn our attention towards the profile likelihood ratio test , a frequentist test that we will use to assess the detectability of streams with different velocities in a parametric way .",
    "model comparison is performed by considering two hypotheses , a null hypothesis , @xmath190 , that the wimp distribution is described by a mb distribution alone with no stream component and an alternative hypothesis , @xmath191 , where the density of the stream is non - zero .",
    "the profile likelihood ratio test utilises the fact that the model best describing the null hypothesis is contained within the model best describing the alternative hypothesis .",
    "we use this test as it is computationally easier than performing bayesian inference over a range of input velocities .",
    "the likelihood ratio between the null and alternative hypotheses is @xmath192 where @xmath193 are the maximum likelihood estimators in the alternative model , and @xmath194 are the maximum likelihood estimators evaluated when the stream density fraction is fixed at zero , @xmath195 .",
    "the likelihood ratio test statistic is then defined as @xmath196    next we require an expression for the statistical significance of a particular measured test statistic value .",
    "this requires knowledge of how the profile likelihood ratio test statistic @xmath197 is distributed in the case that the null hypothesis is true , i.e. if the observed value is @xmath198 :    @xmath199    it is known however from wilk s theorem  @xcite that the distribution of the profile likelihood ratio test statistic in the case that the null hypothesis is true asymptotes towards a @xmath200 distribution .",
    "hence the discovery significance is defined as @xmath201 .",
    "however as we will be quoting quite high values of significance it is simpler to write them in units of standard deviation , @xmath202 , i.e. @xmath203 . so a value of @xmath204 corresponds to a 1@xmath202 result or a significance of 68% .",
    "the significance obtainable by 95% of mock experiments , @xmath114 , is then found by solving the equation , @xmath205 in fig .",
    "[ llratio_null_alternative_dists ] we show the distributions of @xmath197 from @xmath149 mock experiments under the null and alternative hypotheses , for the sagittarius - like stream given in tab . [",

    "for a non - zero stream density fraction the test statistic has a gaussian distribution which moves further from @xmath206 as the stream density is increased .",

    "tab : partable ] .",
    "the test , by virtue of being parametric , performs much better than the non - parametric tests . for the example of the sagittarius stream , indicated in the figures by a star ,",
    "the tests for the three energy windows detect the stream at @xmath207 in 95% of experiments . for the same exposure",
    ", the non - parametric tests could only reach a value of @xmath208 between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the enhancement in performance is also due to the use of the full energy and direction data whereas before only the direction information was used .",
    "furthermore the tests achieve high significance over a wide range of stream velocities , with the limiting factor being the number of wimps coming from the stream , @xmath209 , as can be seen by comparing the two figures . for low values of @xmath160 , where the number of stream wimps drops to zero",
    ", the significance can be seen to do likewise .",
    "there is similarly a dependence on the energy window of the detector which causes a reduction in the number of stream wimps when the stream becomes boosted past the maximum of the energy window .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the @xmath93 $ ] kev case . for a stream speed of 500 km s@xmath40 ,",
    "the significance begins to decrease for @xmath210 and drops by @xmath211 up to @xmath212 .",
    "however the significance for faster stream speeds is enhanced over what might be expected simply from the dependence on @xmath213 .",
    "this is due to faster streams becoming more prominent because of the exponential drop off with energy of the event rate for the smooth halo .",
    "the number of events from wimps in the stream , @xmath213 , plays a key role in determining the detectability of a stream .",
    "therefore in fig .",
    "[ n_wimp_str_location_cont ] we show @xmath213 as a function of the stream speed and direction for the three energy windows and @xmath214 and @xmath215 gev . as discussed earlier , provided the wimp mass is large enough that the stream recoils are above the energy threshold , then increasing the wimp mass decreases the number of stream events .",
    "the energies of the stream recoils depend on the stream velocity as well as the wimp mass .",
    "increasing the threshold energy to 20 kev or reducing the maximum energy to 50 kev reduces the size of the region of steam speed - angle parameter space within which the number of stream events is large enough for the stream to be detected . for a 10 gev wimp and a 20 kev threshold",
    "a stream will only be detectable if it has a high speed and a large angle relative to the lab velocity .",
    "using both non - parametric directional tests and a profile likelihood test , we have shown that there are reasonable prospects for the detection of a moderately high density tidal stream by a future directional detector .",
    "we have looked at the concrete example of a sagittarius - like stream and also explored the dependence on the parameters of the stream , namely its speed , direction , dispersion and density .",
    "using non - parametric directional statistics the detection of a sagittarius - like stream would need a total of around 900 events , but using bayesian parameter estimation good constraints can be placed on the stream parameters with around 300 events , independent of astrophysical uncertainties . for wimp - nucleon spin - dependent cross sections just below the current exclusion limits  @xcite this",
    "corresponds to around 10 kg yr exposure , which is within the scope of future directional detectors  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the detectability of a stream is highly dependent on its speed and position in relation to the lab velocity .",
    "faster streams that are oriented at @xmath216 with respect to the lab velocity are most easily detected when using directional statistics as the signal in this case deviates furthest from the smooth halo signal . using a profile likelihood ratio test , there is weaker dependence on the position of the stream as the likelihood does not favour a particular directionality of the signal , but there is naturally a dependence on the the number of wimps originating from the stream , which indirectly leads to a dependence on stream direction .",
    "faster streams can be detected with higher significance , as they cause more events and are also more prominent in the energy spectrum , due to the exponential drop off with energy of events from the smooth halo .",
    "a similar conclusion is likely for parameter estimation as weaker constraints would be made on parameters of the stream with fewer wimps from the stream .",
    "the estimation of halo and wimp parameters would also be dependent on the stream velocity , if the stream is boosted out of the energy window of the detector there would be fewer events overall which would weaken the relative constraints .",
    "the advantage of using non - parametric tests is that one need not assume a model to describe the data , simply that the data satisfy either a null or alternative hypothesis .",
    "however non - parametric tests will always return a less significant result than parametric tests .",
    "the likelihood analyses also make use of both the energy and direction information of the recoils whereas the non - parametric tests are direction only .",
    "the kuiper and median direction tests may be improved with the use of energy information however this would result in a greater dependence on the wimp mass and would be expected to perform poorly with low numbers of recoils .",
    "we have also investigated a number of experimental considerations .",
    "firstly , as might be expected , a larger experimental background rate results in poorer performance of the statistical tests , but the dependence on the background rate flattens at very large values .",
    "a crucial factor is the energy window of the detector , where for the detection of streams the window must cover the range of recoil energies from stream wimps .",
    "this is dependent on both the speed of the stream and its direction in relation to the lab velocity as we have demonstrated .",
    "the statistical methods we have studied here may all be applied in a practical setting on real data , however there remain some experimental issues that may affect the detectability of streams .",
    "the mock detector we have considered here has perfect angular resolution . in practice a finite angular resolution of around @xmath217",
    "is thought to be achievable for future detectors @xcite .",
    "this will have some impact on the power of an experiment to detect fine substructure , however the results here are likely to remain valid if finite angular resolution is taken into account either through a binned analysis or by adding in an uncertainty in the recoil data .",
    "another experimental concern is that of sense recognition ( i.e. distinguishing between @xmath10 and @xmath218 ) which remains an issue for some current directional detectors .",
    "a lack of sense recognition has been shown to increase the number of events needed to reject an isotropic non - wimp background in the initial detection phase  @xcite and is likely to be problematic for the detection of substructure and new tools may be needed to reconstruct the velocity distribution if it is still an issue in the future .    to conclude , we have shown that if a moderately high density wimp stream is present in the solar neighbourhood then there are good prospects for its detection using directional dark matter detectors .",
    "the authors thank mattia fornasa and tasos avgoustidis for useful discussions .",
    "cajo and amg are both supported by the stfc .",
    "in this appendix we studying the effects of assuming an exponential , rather than flat , background energy spectrum on the stream parameter estimation in sec .",
    "[ param - reconstruct ] .",
    "the `` worst possible '' energy dependence would be an exponential with a characteristic scale that is similar to that of the wimp signal i.e. @xmath219 where @xmath83 is defined as the rate observed in an experiment with a window of @xmath153 $ ] kev and @xmath220 for a background which mimics the energy dependence of a @xmath221 wimp .",
