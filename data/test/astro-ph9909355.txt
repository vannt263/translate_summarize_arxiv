    "sgr1627 - 41 , the fourth soft gamma repeater , was discovered in a series of observations between 1998 june and 1998 july by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( woods et al .",
    "1999 ) , the gamma - ray burst experiment aboard _ ulysses ( hurley et al . 1999 ) , the konus experiment aboard the _ wind spacecraft ( mazets et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the all sky monitor on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( smith et al .",
    "the interplanetary network ( ipn ) error box for sgr1627 - 41 passes through the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g337.0 - 0.1 ( hurley et al .",
    "1999 ) . two _ bepposax observations of this region on 1998 august 7 and 1998 september 16 revealed an x - ray source , most likely a neutron star , whose position was consistent with that of both the ipn localization and the snr ; the source displayed a possible periodicity of 6.41 s ( chance probability @xmath1 , based on a limited number of trials : woods et al .",
    "_ _ _ _ _    based on batse observations of the sgr in outburst , woods et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated that the neutron star magnetic field strength was @xmath2 .",
    "these properties would make the sgr counterpart a magnetar , an object in which magnetic energy dominates all other sources of energy , including rotation ( thompson and duncan , 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "evidence that other sgrs are also magnetars has been presented ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; but see also marsden , rothschild & lingenfelter 1999 ) . in those cases , decisive evidence for",
    "the magnetic field strength came from the spindown rates , and their interpretation as dipole radiation . in an attempt to confirm the periodicity of sgr1627 - 41 and measure its spindown rate",
    ", we observed the source with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) . _",
    "the asca observation took place between 1999 february 26 and 1999 february 28 .",
    "the nominal pointing direction was @xmath3 , and the approximate exposures were 72.7 ks for the sis and 78.4 ks for the gis .",
    "we used the standard screening criteria for such parameters as earth elevation angle , south atlantic anomaly , and cutoff rigidity to extract photons , as explained in the asca data reduction guide , version 2 .",
    "no bursts from the source were observed by _",
    "ulysses , batse , or asca during the observation ( the last burst from sgr1627 - 41 was observed in 1998 august ) . using the ximage source detection tool ,",
    "a quiescent source was detected at @xmath4 with a 3 @xmath5 error radius 55 @xmath6 , consistent with the 1 @xmath7 radius error circle of the _ bepposax source ( figure 1 ) .",
    "approximately 3800 net counts were detected , versus @xmath8 2850 in the first _ bepposax observation .",
    "two other sources were detected in this observation ( one is visible in figure 1 ) , but neither had a position consistent with either the ipn annulus or g337.0 - 0.1 .",
    "assuming that the asca , _ bepposax , and sgr sources are the same object , the most likely position of the sgr is around the intersection of the ipn annulus with this new error circle , at @xmath9 . _ _ _ _    the region used for spectral analysis consisted of a 105 @xmath6 radius circle centered at the source position ; background was taken from the same observation , using a similar circle at a region where no source was present , as determined by ximage .",
    "spectral fitting to the gis2 and gis3 data was done using xspec and three trial functions : blackbody , thermal bremsstrahlung , and a power law , all with absorption .",
    "these results are reported in table 1 , along with the earlier _ bepposax results .",
    "there is no clear preference for any of these models , but we adopt the power law fit for further discussion . _    to search for periodicity , barycentric light curves were constructed with 0.125 s binning from the sum of the gis2 and gis3 data , by extracting @xmath8 1 - 10 kev counts from a 4 @xmath7 radius circular region around the source , and an fft was performed ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the most prominent peak in the power spectrum was at 0.10821 hz ( significance 0.12 ) .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit to the power of any signal in the spectrum with period between 0.01 and 1 hz is @xmath8 3% ( rms ) .",
    "woods et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a 6.413183 s period in the first of their two _ bepposax observations , with an rms pulse fraction of 10% @xmath10 2.6% .",
    "the upper limit to the signal power at this period from the folded asca light curve is 1.8% ( rms ) .",
    "this limit would be appropriate only if the spindown rate were zero ; if the quiescent counterpart to sgr1627 - 41 is characterized by a rate @xmath11 , as is the case for sgr1900 + 14 , the period could have changed by as much as 0.0015 s between the _ bepposax and asca observations , and the 3% upper limit would be the appropriate one .",
    "we can also state with varying degrees of confidence that no significant periodicities exist between 0.001 and 0.01 hz , although in this range the period search is dominated by windowing effects from the data gaps and non - uniform sampling . _ _",
    "the earlier _ bepposax observations of the quiescent counterpart of sgr1627 - 41 indicated a fading trend , significant at the @xmath12 level in the raw data , over the @xmath8 5 week period between the two pointings ( woods et al .",
    "1999 , and table 1 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev flux found in the asca observation reported here is consistent with that found in the second _ bepposax observation , and therefore indicates that this trend did not continue .",
    "we have checked this conclusion in two ways .",
    "first , we performed a joint fit to the _ bepposax and asca observations , and found that they could be described well by a single power law with no change in normalization .",
    "second , we calculated the unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev source flux fixing the best fit power law index and @xmath13 to those found in the _ bepposax observations , and confirmed that it agreed with the _ bepposax flux . _ _ _ _ _    relatively little is known about the mechanisms for variability in the quiescent soft x - ray counterparts to sgrs . since variability in the quiescent emission of sgr1900 + 14",
    "has definitely been observed ( kouveliotou et al . 1999 , murakami et al .",
    "1999 ) , it seems plausible that the quiescent steady emission from sgr1627 - 41 , varying at an earlier time , could have ceased to vary by the time of the observations reported here .",
    "it could also be argued that the periodic quiescent emission originated on a cooling hot spot on the neutron star surface , and that it became undetectable by the time of the asca observations . in any case , however , compelling evidence that sgr1627 - 41 is a magnetar must await an unambiguous detection of the periodicity and a measurement of the spindown rate .",
    "chandra observations could resolve this and also determine the precise source position .",
