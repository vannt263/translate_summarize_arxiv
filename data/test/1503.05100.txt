    "molecular clouds at high galactic latitude represent an abundant source of gamma - rays due to interactions with cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "high latitude clouds are primarily low mass and harbor little to no active star formation ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are also often relatively isolated from localized cosmic ray acceleration sites such as supernova remnants or ob associations .",
    "thus , their gamma - ray emission should reflect the steady - state cosmic ray density and spectrum of the surrounding region in the galaxy .",
    "these clouds are all nearby with most having a distance @xmath1 pc for @xmath2 given a scale height of 150 pc @xcite .",
    "high latitude clouds therefore represent potentially pristine probes of the cosmic ray spectrum in the solar neighborhood .",
    "diffuse gamma - ray emission comes from a combination of cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , inverse compton scattering of ambient radiation by cosmic ray electrons and positrons , and extragalactic diffuse emission .",
    "cosmic ray interactions with the ism produce primarily gev gamma - rays via proton - proton collisions which lead to the production of neutral and charged pions .",
    "neutral pions decay directly into gamma - rays while the charged pion species ultimately decay into electrons and positrons .",
    "cosmic ray leptons interact with gas to create gamma - rays mainly via bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the ism is effectively transparent to cosmic rays , so the gamma - ray emission is sensitive to the total gas column density regardless of dust properties or gas state ( hi , hii , ) .",
    "the necessary likelihood modeling of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data incorporates contributions to the gamma - ray emission from gas traced by 21 cm hi  emission and the integrated 2.6 mm co ( ) line emission ( ) @xcite .",
    "is assumed to be directly proportional to the column density of molecular hydrogen : @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , gamma - rays have been used to calibrate @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . however , likelihood models of gamma - ray emission based solely on the distribution of these two species exhibit significant residual gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "this excess gamma - ray emission is assumed to trace unseen molecular or atomic gas , which has been called dark gas . in cold molecular clouds",
    ", the dark gas mass can be a significant fraction of the total gas mass@xcite .",
    "dark gas is expected in photodissociation regions and diffuse clouds exposed to the interstellar radiation field .",
    "because co self - shields less efficiently and has a lower dissociation energy than , co dissociation occurs deeper into a cloud ( i.e. , to higher ) .",
    "therefore , between @xmath5 , co fails to trace  linearly @xcite .",
    "clouds in this range of  are classified as  translucent \" @xcite , and represent most molecular clouds at high latitude @xcite .",
    "translucent clouds tend to be smaller and less dense than giant molecular clouds , but should be much more numerous @xcite .",
    "a lingering problem with modeling gamma - rays from high latitude clouds had been that existing co maps were unavailable , sparse , or incomplete .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "co map is the first all - sky map of the co (  ) emission line @xcite .",
    "we use this co map in a complete , flux - limited survey of high latitude molecular clouds with the _ fermi _ lat . in this paper",
    ", we describe the methods and systematic uncertainties of the survey and report on gamma - ray observations of 9 high latitude , translucent molecular clouds .",
    "every cloud has detectable gamma - ray emission consistent with maps of either co , dark gas , or both .",
    "we also report the photon index of each cloud , as it reflects the incident cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "this work presents the initial results from the full survey .",
    "for this pilot survey , we identify well - known molecular clouds with @xmath6 from previous surveys to analyze in gamma - rays . clouds at such latitudes are all nearby , which ensures the gamma - ray flux is high enough to study .",
    "large clouds at lower galactic latitude , such as orion , have already been extensively studied with the _ fermi _ lat @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a study on the possible gamma - ray emission based on a number of co surveys @xcite .",
    "we find candidate clouds from these surveys and identify them in the _ planck _ co map .",
    "we choose several of the brightest high latitude clouds from these surveys .",
    "three other , fainter clouds are chosen to explore the low limits for gamma - ray detection .",
    "two bright clouds , g313.1 - 28.6 and g315.1 - 29.0 , are identified via visual inspection of the _ planck _ co map .",
    "these were observed in an earlier co catalog towards dark clouds @xcite and named chamaeleon - east ii @xcite , but were not part of the surveys described in @xcite , nor mapped by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we choose a region devoid of large - scale gas and dust emission by visual inspection of the _ planck _ co map and the color excess map of @xcite .",
    "this region , centered on galactic coordinates @xmath7 , is used to test the false detection rate of gamma - ray emission from co or dark gas .",
    "some relevant properties of the chosen clouds are listed in table [ tab : prop ] .",
    "the areas of the clouds are calculated from the co extent in the _ planck _ map .",
    "distances to the clouds are taken from the literature and were derived from color excess @xcite .",
    "many , but not all , of the clouds have masses estimated in prior surveys , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the locations of the clouds relative to the solar system can be seen in figures [ fig : dist_xy ] , [ fig : dist_xz ] , and [ fig : dist_yz ] .",
    "most of the clouds lie below the galactic plane , as shown in figures [ fig : dist_xz ] and [ fig : dist_yz ] , but represent a large range of galactic longitudes seen in figure [ fig : dist_xy ] .",
    "the lat on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ is a pair - tracking telescope , sensitive to gamma - rays between 20 mev and 300 gev .",
    "the tracker is surrounded by anti - coincidence detectors to distinguish between cosmic ray and gamma - ray events .",
    "the photon localization strongly depends on the photon energy ; at 1 gev , the 68% containment radius is 08 , decreasing with energy to roughly @xmath8 at around 10 gev @xcite .",
    "we use data of the entire sky from the _ fermi _ lat between august 4 , 2008 and june 19 , 2013 .",
    "we use the _ fermi _ science tools ( v9r27p1 ) available from the _ fermi _ science support center , utilizing the p7_v6 instrument response function .",
    "when selecting the data , we consider both front and back converted photons in the  source \" class .",
    "we select data from a @xmath9 radius around the chosen coordinates and between 250 mev and 10 gev .",
    "these energies are chosen to maximize both source localization and photon statistics . including photons between 10 and 100 gev",
    "does not improve the significance of the detection , as will be explained in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we exclude photons with incidence angle @xmath10 from the zenith and any time the spacecraft rocking angle exceeds 52 .",
    "these constraints remove most gamma - ray contamination coming from the earth s limb .",
    "we perform a binned likehihood analysis , selecting the data which lie inside a @xmath11 square centered on the region of interest ( roi ) center .",
    "the basic procedure for the likelihood analysis of gamma - ray data is described in @xcite .",
    "to evaluate source detection and model significance , we consider the test statistic ( @xmath12 ) , which is proportional to the difference of the log likelihoods of two different models :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the likelihoods for two models we are comparing .",
    "the @xmath12 represents the significance of model @xmath16 over model @xmath17 .    to create the model , point sources",
    "are taken from the fermi 2 year catalog @xcite version 6 ( 2fgl ) .",
    "for those clouds with point sources from the 2fgl coincident with the co emission , we remove the point source from the model .",
    "sources outside of 7  from the roi center have all free parameters fixed for the fitting procedure , while closer sources only have their spectral indices fixed .",
    "after an initial fitting , weak point sources ( @xmath18 ) are removed .",
    "new point sources are identified by subtracting the best fit model from the counts map , then smoothing this gamma - ray residual map and identifying regions exceeding 3 standard deviations above the average residual .",
    "two additional components common to any model include the isotropic and galactic inverse compton emission .",
    "the isotropic emission , originating from extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray emission and misclassification of cosmic rays in the lat , is modeled by the  iso_p7v6source.txt \" provided by the fermi science support center .",
    "the inverse compton component uses galprop @xcite , and is added in as a data cube from the galprop input galdef file  54_77xvarh7s \" @xcite .    finally , we model diffuse emission arising from interstellar gas and dust .",
    "we use six different models for this analysis to determine the significance of the gamma - ray emission from each gas component .",
    "the baseline model , against which we compare all others , contains all the neutral gas elements : hi , co , and dark gas ( _ codg _ ) . to check the significance of gamma - ray emission from the molecular cloud , we compare the baseline model to one containing only hi  ( _ hi _ ) .",
    "two additional models are used to check the significance of gamma - ray emission from co and dark gas individually : one model with hiand dark gas ( _ dg _ ) and another model with hiand co ( _ co _ ) . to check whether the gamma - ray emission comes from an extended source or a point source ,",
    "the co and dark gas templates in the model are replaced with a point source located at the peak of the co emission ( _ ps _ )",
    ". finally , we test for any background point sources by adding one at the peak co emission in addition to hi , co , and dark gas ( _ codgps _ ) . in the cases where the roi has confused 2fgl sources ( see table [ tab : ptsrces ] ) , we add the specific 2fgl source into the model instead of adding a separate source .    for neutral atomic gas , we separate the hi  data from the lab survey @xcite into two templates . in the first , we integrate over the velocity axis between @xmath19 to account for nearby , ambient gas associated with the cloud .",
    "the second template uses the rest of the hi  data to account for background hi  gas .",
    "we calculate the hi  column density , @xmath20(hi ) , using a spin temperature @xmath21 k , consistent with previous gamma - ray studies @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 @xmath24 k@xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the background temperature at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the @xmath20(hi ) map is in a local coordinate system centered on the clouds and is linearly interpolated to @xmath27 per pixel from the all sky map .    for the template",
    ", we use  maps taken from _ planck _ with a @xmath28 cut .",
    "we use the  type 2 \" map , which combines data from different frequency channels to improve overall signal - to - noise by removing contaminating signals from cmb , dust , and free - free emission , though @xmath29co contamination remains .",

    "this residual map , hereafter referred to as , is estimated as :    @xmath32    the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are varied until the best fit combination of @xmath20(hi ) and  is found @xcite .",
    "both the  and  maps are use the same coordinates as the @xmath20(hi ) map and are interpolated from the healpix maps provided by _ planck_. the four gas templates used for mbm 12 are shown in figure [ fig : mbm12temp ] .",
    "these templates are all made 3  larger on each side than the region selected to account for possible gamma - ray photons leaking into the selected region due to the large point - spread function .",
    "finally , the _ fermi _ bubbles @xcite represent an additional background source of gamma - ray emission for one cloud in this study , mbm 36 .",
    "we add a constant component with a power law spectrum across the mbm 36 roi @xcite to account for this emission .",
    "every model component adds linearly to the total gamma - ray intensity @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the inverse compton contribution to the gamma - ray intensity , @xmath37 is the isotropic contribution , and @xmath38 is the contribution due to point sources .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are normalization coefficients , and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 which are the emissivities of the respective gas templates in units of photon flux per h - atom , per k , and per magnitude of residual extinction , respectively .    to perform the fitting",
    ", we used the python likelihood analysis tools provided by the fssc .",

    "we find diffuse gamma - ray emission from molecular gas to high significance in all 9 regions studied .",
    "the control region has no diffuse gamma - ray emission from co or dark gas .",
    "all clouds show extended gamma - ray emission , and all four 2fgl associations listed in table [ tab : ptsrces ] are identified as diffuse gamma - ray emission from the clouds themselves .",
    "only mbm 12 shows evidence of a background agn .",
    "mbm 12 , given its provisional classification as a blazar in the 2fgl and potential association with a radio source , goes through additional analyses discussed in a later subsection .",

    "codgps_. a @xmath50 indicates a significant difference between the two models tested .    in the control region , @xmath51 , indicating that we do not detect gamma - rays from gas traced by co or dark gas . for",
    "the rois around the clouds mbm 04 and dir 071 - 43 there is no evidence for significant gamma - ray emission from gas traced by co , as shown by a low @xmath52 .",
    "these rois show evidence for gamma - ray emission dominated by dark gas .",
    "conversely , the rois for mbm 55 and mbm 32 show significant gamma - ray emission from gas traced by co but not by dark gas ; the @xmath52 is high while the @xmath53 is low .",
    "the remainings rois show evidence for emission from both gas traced by co and dark gas to different degrees .",
    "for example , the roi around mbm 12 show significantly more gamma - ray emission from gas traced by co as opposed to dark gas , while the roi around mbm 36 shows more gamma - ray emission from dark gas .",
    "since this sample contains clouds dominated by gamma - ray emission from co and some dominated by emission from dark gas , the translucent clouds may represent the transition to fully molecular clouds .    for every roi",
    ", @xmath48 is large enough to conclude that the gamma - ray emission is not coming from a single point source .",
    "a @xmath54 indicates the presence of a background agn .",
    "only mbm 12 , discussed in the following section , shows significant evidence for a background source .",
    "thus , out of the four point sources given in table [ tab : ptsrces ] , we confirm the existence of one background gamma - ray point source and attribute the other three to diffuse gamma - ray emission from molecular clouds .",
    "we also compare the baseline model to one utilizing the _ fermi _ standard galactic diffuse model for pass 7 .",
    "however , only one cloud in our survey had co data from @xcite included in the diffuse model ( mbm 12 ) . therefore our models , which include co , should more accurately reflect the gas origin of the gamma - ray emission .",
    "further , as will be discussed in section [ sec : uncertain ] , the dust alone results in a poor fit to the data .    over the entire energy range ,",
    "when our gas templates all assume a single power law spectrum , the standard diffuse model has a higher likelihood than any of the models we fit ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the higher likelihood of the _ fermi _ galactic diffuse model is a result of it being fit in many small energy bins , rather than assuming a single power law over the entire energy range , as we do .",
    "a single power law does not capture the curvature in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we tested a log - parabola and a broken power law spectrum for the hi  template and find the fits strongly favored the broken power law spectrum with a @xmath12 of at least 200 over the single power law .",
    "the _ fermi _ galactic diffuse model still fit better with a @xmath56 .",
    "however , for mbm 12 , we have enough data to fit several energy bins , more closely replicating the _ fermi _ galactic diffuse model . in every energy bin ,",
    "our model fits the data as well or better than the standard galactic diffuse model .",
    "thus , we validate our model based on the _ planck _ co , lab hi , and _",
    "planck _ dust data .    for the broken power law spectrum",
    ", the average energy break occurs at @xmath57 gev and the power law index changes from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the break at around 1 gev is expected from cosmic ray proton interactions with the cloud and the power law index above the break energy agrees with predictions for gamma - ray emission from a cloud located far from any cosmic ray acceleration site @xcite . changing the spectral shape from a single power law to broken power law results in a 30% increase in the hi  emissivity but does not affect the other gas emissivities .",
    "we leave the co and  spectra as single power laws for simplicity because hi  is the dominant source of gamma - rays across the roi . changing the spectrum of the hi co , and  templates to a broken power law resulted in no improvement ( @xmath60 for six additional free parameters ) over the model where only the hi  had a broken power law spectrum .",
    "mbm 12 is the best studied high latitude , translucent molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has the highest peak @xmath61 of the sample and was tentatively identified as a blazar with a  confused \" designation in the fermi 2-year catalog ( 2fgl j0257.9 + 2025c ) .",
    "it is also coincident with a radio source from the 3@xmath62 mit - green bank radio survey ( mg3 j025805 + 2029 ) .",
    "mbm 12 , therefore , merits further analysis .    figure [ fig : mbm12temp ] shows the distribution of the gas in the region around mbm 12 .",
    "figure [ fig : mbm12cmap ] shows the total number of gamma - rays detected in the region around mbm 12 over the time period analyzed .",
    "a 2fgl source , as well as the coincident radio source , lie near the centroid of the molecular cloud .    to establish the molecular cloud origin of the gamma - rays over an agn source ,",
    "we perform both a spatial and a variability test .",
    "the results of the spatial tests are given as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "mbm 12 , after removing 2fgl j0257.9 + 2025c , has @xmath65 which verifies the presence of the 2fgl point source .",
    "all other @xmath12 values are calculated with this point source included in the model .",
    "a @xmath66 implies that the gamma - ray emission is extended .",
    "the results from these two spatial tests argue in favor of the translucent cloud origin of the gamma - ray emission .    for the variability test",
    ", we compare the gamma - ray flux in 15-week time bins to the flux over the entire 58 month period of the survey . as mbm 12 lies far from possible cosmic ray acceleration sites ,",
    "the cosmic ray source is dominated by the mean steady - state diffusion of cosmic rays through the galaxy , and should be constant . as a result ,",
    "significant variability in the gamma - ray flux from mbm 12 would indicate a background agn , which are the most common gamma - ray sources at high latitude @xcite and typically exhibit variability @xcite .",
    "the lightcurve of mbm 12 is given in figure [ fig : mbm12lc ] and is the sum of the gamma - ray fluxes from hi , co , and dark gas . by eye , they all appear to have constant emission over the observed period .",
    "time bins 4 and 5 as well as 10 and 11 were combined to minimize convergence errors .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the integrated flux found over the entire time period , and the shaded region is the associated uncertainty . with 13 time bins , we find @xmath67 when comparing the flux to a constant , implying that the gamma - ray flux from mbm 12 is consistent with zero variability .",
    "the tests show that we both detect diffuse gamma - ray emission from mbm 12 and confirm the existence of 2fgl j0257.9 + 2025c , associated with mg3 j025805 + 2029 . because we can recover point sources that have been intentionally removed from the model , we gain confidence that we can detect other new sources not included in the 2fgl and disentangle them from diffuse cloud emission .    as the brightest source in the survey",
    ", we also use mbm 12 to test the validity of our chosen energy range .",
    "data analyzed in this region between 10 to 100 gev shows no significant emission from molecular gas , with a @xmath68",
    ". additionally , the hi  emissivity between 250 mev and 100 gev differs by only 5% from the hi  emissivity between 250 mev and 10 gev .",
    "this difference is well within the systematic uncertainty . extending the analysis to 100 gev , therefore does not significantly change the emissivity .",
    "we are ultimately trying to probe for small effects , such as possible gradients in the cosmic ray flux in the solar neighborhood , so it is important to identify and characterize as many sources of uncertainty as possible .",
    "systematic errors introduced by the lat instrument are estimated to be around 10% @xcite .",
    "they arise primarily from uncertainties in the instrument response function , the energy determination of the photons , and the effective area of the lat .",
    "the remaining uncertainties are derived from the results of the likelihood analysis .",
    "non - local hi , co , and dark gas each have two free parameters associated with them and local hi  has four free parameters .",
    "in addition , the inverse compton and isotropic emission templates include a normalization term , bringing the total number of template free parameters to 12 .",
    "additional , compounded , free parameters are used to create the  maps and are discussed below .",
    "point sources add additional free parameters and models with a lot of free parameters tend to converge poorly or force a parameter to one of its limits , which skews the error calculation .",
    "therefore , our analysis procedure removes weak point sources .",
    "we test models with different initial values and find that when the models converge , the resulting gamma - ray fluxes and photon indices typically vary by less than 10% .",
    "we take the combined uncertainty due to the lat systematics and the likelihood variations to be @xmath6915% .",
    "the uncertainties in the emissivities depend on the detailed model inputs .",
    "the lab survey measured the radiation roughly @xmath70  to @xmath71  around the 21 cm line with a sensitivity of 0.09 k @xcite .",
    "the high velocity gas is all very far away while the low velocity gas is much closer , so we perform a velocity cut of @xmath72 on the data to separate nearby gas from far .",
    "most of the hi  emission in our clouds lies inside of this cutoff .",
    "the velocity cutoff is a fairly small source of error .",
    "generally , the higher velocity gas contributes at most 10% more column density .",
    "high velocity gas , given its much farther distance , is expected to contribute little to the total gamma - ray flux .",
    "when the higher velocity hi  is significantly detected , the effect on the hi  flux of the cloud is @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , the hi  template suffers from uncertainty due to the assumed spin temperature .",
    "spin temperatures likely change across an roi and even across an individual cloud @xcite .",
    "we tested four spin temperatures : @xmath74 k , 125 k , 400 k , and @xmath75 .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from hi  changed less than 7% while the emissivity decreased by 15% with increasing @xmath76 over the entire range of @xmath76 values .",
    "surrounding the molecular cloud may be a shell of optically thick hi  with a very low spin temperature , that also contributes to the dark gas phenomenon @xcite .",
    "any unaccounted for hi  due to a lower spin temperature than the 125 k used should be captured in the  map .",
    "this should not affect the hi  emissivity or gamma - ray flux by more than 5% , as the hi  in the cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total hi  emission across the roi .",
    "the main uncertainties from the co template comes from the 2@xmath77 cutoff used to remove noise , and the @xmath29co contamination of the _ planck _ data @xcite .",
    "we tested a 1@xmath77 cutoff as well and saw emissivities and fluxes systematically lower by around 5% .",
    "this is expected since the co covers a larger area in the 1@xmath77 template versus the 2@xmath77 template .",
    "yet the distribution of co does not change much ; most of the difference between the 1@xmath77 and 2@xmath77 templates is noise and distributed roughly uniformly around the map .",
    "nearly the same flux is being emitted from a larger amount of co , therefore the emissivity decreases accordingly .",
    "the  map is a linear combination of the lab hi map , the _ planck _ co map , and the @xcite color excess map , where the uncertainties for the color excess are generally less than 8% , with an average across each roi of less than 4% .",
    "the uncertainty in the color excess dominates the errors over those of the hi  and co maps .",
    "the fluxes and emissivities for co and  are insensitive to the change in spin temperature .",
    "even between the two extremes , @xmath74 k and @xmath78 , the  template changes by less than 2% on average , which is much smaller than the uncertainties of the color excess map .",
    "additional uncertainties in the  map arise in @xmath79 .",
    "while overall variations in @xmath30 will not affect the hi  emissivity , co and dark gas emissivities may be affected if @xmath30 varies across the roi .",
    "@xmath31 in diffuse regions @xcite but increases to @xmath80 in some molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "a constant @xmath30 may underpredict the extinction values in molecular clouds by as much as 30% .",
    "the uncertaintiy in the emissivity is not clear due to the relationship between  and .    to study this effect , other dust templates may be more approprate .",
    "for example , a properly scaled @xmath81 map is recommended for regions of higher  @xcite instead of the map .",
    "this test was performed in the chamaeleon region in @xcite . changing the dust map",
    "necessarily affects the  map , and therefore also the fitted and subsequently calculated quantities .",
    "we test both dust maps in mbm 12 .",
    "comparing both models yields a @xmath82 .",
    "therefore neither  nor @xmath81 are preferred over the other .",
    "the  emissivity changed by up to 30% while the hi  and co emissivities changed by less than 5% .",
    "we quantify the effect of the dust template more thoroughly in the full survey and defer that discussion to future work .",
    "we argue that with only 9 clouds in our current sample , a 30% change in dark gas emissivity does not significantly affect the results discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally , we also tested a model using the dust map as the sole gas tracer . in principle",
    ", the extinction should trace all gas species and thus should provide a model with significantly fewer free parameters .",
    "the dust model , however , does not reproduce the gamma - ray data .",
    "the @xmath12 between model _",
    "codg _ and the model with dust alone is 175 ; the dust model fits significantly worse than our baseline model , and exhibits large , structured residuals in regions with co and dark gas .",
    "this may be due to varying dust properties @xcite , a lack of sensitivity in dense regions , a limited range of applicablility , or a nonlinear response .",

    "the average value for  among the clouds is ( @xmath123 )  ( k ) @xmath25 .",

    "this result agrees with previous studies of @xmath4 at high latitudes @xcite , suggesting the dark gas in these previous studies is primarily molecular .",
    "our average @xmath4 is higher than the average value found in perseus @xcite , which may suggest that the molecular fraction of the dark gas in perseus is significantly lower than 1 or cosmic rays do not penetrate deeply into the co - bright regions of the cloud .",
    "our @xmath4 for every cloud is consistent with that found in the high latitude cloud mbm 40 which found an average @xmath130  ( k ) @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : xco_dist ] shows @xmath4 as a function of galactocentric distance .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows one of the more extreme variations of @xmath4 considered near the solar neighborhood @xcite . as with the gamma - ray spectrum , we find no evidence for overall variation in @xmath4 over this small extent of 270 pc .",
    "figure [ fig : xco_comp ] shows @xmath4 across the co - bright part of mbm 12 , assuming @xmath128 uniformly across the entire cloud .",
    "this places an upper limit on the value of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath109 appears to increase towards the edge of the co - emitting region where the total extinction drops by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "the middle of the cloud shows a low @xmath109 , where the total extinction increases due to increased gas density .",
    "a higher density supports the transition to fully molecular gas .",
    "this transition reduces the fraction of dark gas in the cloud .",
    "thus , the departure of @xmath4 from  in the co - bright part of the cloud may reflect the transition of the cloud from atomic to molecular gas or it may reflect a level of small - scale clumpiness in the cloud , supporting some interior dissociation along the line of sight . if @xmath108 decreases to zero toward the edge of the co - bright part of the cloud , we can potentially recover a constant @xmath4 across the cloud , though not expected to occur @xcite .    as can be seen by visual inspection of the co and dark gas maps in figure [ fig : mbm12temp ]",
    ", dark gas extends beyond the co boundaries as expected from numerical studies @xcite . in these regions , we can only place limits on @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to estimate @xmath4 beyond the co - bright boundary of the molecular cloud .    finally , as an initial evaluation of the dust model , we replace the _",
    "map in mbm 12 with the _ planck _",
    "@xmath81 dust opacity map , scaled by the given ratio : @xmath131 @xcite . in mbm 12 ,",
    "changing the dust model greatly affects .",
    "however @xmath109 changes by @xmath132  ( k ) @xmath25 , which is smaller than the variations of @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath109 is thus moderately insensitive to large variations in  due to suppression by the ratio @xmath133 , which averages between 0.01  0.10 mag ( k ) @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth noting that , while the distribution of @xmath4 seen in figure [ fig : xco_comp ] depends on the dust tracer used , the magnitude of the variation of @xmath109 is larger than any uncertainty of @xmath109 .",
    "we will quantify the uncertainty due to changing the dust tracer in future work .",
    "we study the gamma - ray emission from nine high latitude , translucent molecular clouds and find the gamma - ray spectrum and emissivity from the gas in the clouds .",
    "all nine _ planck_-selected co clouds were significantly detected , showing extended emission associated with molecular gas .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainties associated with modeling the gamma - ray emission with hi , co , and dark gas templates .",
    "the hi  emissivity does not vary across the regions in the sample .",
    "for some clouds , the gamma - ray emission is dominated by the co - emitting gas , while for other clouds the co - dark gas dominates the gamma - ray emission .  ranges from 0.2  ( k ) @xmath25 to 1.6  ( k ) @xmath25 with large uncertainties , and  spans a similarly large range around @xmath134  mag@xmath25 . in order to compare these x - factors to the traditional conversion factor between  and  and",
    "are added together assuming the molecular fraction of the dark gas is 1 .",
    "the results are consistent with previous studies and suggest no change in cosmic ray flux across @xmath135 pc region around the solar system .",
    "the combination of  and  may also explain the low values of @xmath4 found in @xcite compared with estimates using other methods @xcite .",
