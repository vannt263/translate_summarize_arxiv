    "since its discovery in 1974 , the @xmath0 meson has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath3 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules , i.e.  the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath4 ) velocity @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath7 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath8 with definite spin @xmath9 , orbital angular momentum @xmath10 , total angular momentum @xmath11 , and colour multiplicity @xmath12 .",
    "the hierarchy of the mes predicted by the velocity scaling rules is explained for the @xmath0 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 mesons in table  [ tab : vsr ] . in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of colour - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath7 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , colour - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath15 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) @xcite is recovered .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath16 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the csm prediction .",

    "inclusive @xmath0 production in dis lends itself as a sensitive probe of the co mechanism . as for @xmath20",
    ", the h1 data @xcite generally confirms nrqcd and disfavours the csm @xcite .",
    "however , nrqcd predicts at lo a distinct rise in cross section as @xmath21 , which is not reflected by the h1 data .",
    "this anomaly is familiar from photoproduction , and it is likely to be resolved by the inclusion of higher - order corrections @xcite , possibly in combination with intrinsic-@xmath22 effects and/or nonperturbative shape functions . as for @xmath23 , the chorus central value for the total cross section @xcite exceeds the lo prediction @xcite by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "however , the experimental error is still rather sizeable . as for @xmath24 ,",
    "co processes are dominant , diffractive ones are absent , and the experimental signature is spectacular , so that a measurement would be worthwhile @xcite .",
