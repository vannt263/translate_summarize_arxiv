    "there is a lot of current interest in studying the collision of two black holes since these events could be primary sources of gravitational waves for interferometric gravitational wave detectors currently under construction .",
    "numerical simulations are considered as the key to model such collisions .",
    "unfortunately , current computer limitations cause these simulations to be short lived , so to study the actual merger of two holes , one needs to have initial data that represents two black holes close to each other .",
    "early attempts to provide binary black hole initial data solved the initial value problem of general relativity using conformally flat slices @xcite .",
    "this restriction was too strong ; it was unable to incorporate spinning holes . lately",
    ", some effort has been geared towards obtaining initial data based on the kerr ",
    "schild form of black hole solutions .",
    "the main advantage of this form is that the spatial slices of these solutions are horizon penetrating , which make them ideal for the application of the `` excision '' method @xcite for evolving black holes .",
    "this form of the solution also naturally incorporates boosted and spinning black holes .",
    "there is also another way @xcite to obtain initial data for a black hole binary , without solving the initial value equations directly .",
    "one could , in principle , consider a scenario with matter fields coupled to gravity such that there are no black holes to begin with .",
    "one could distribute the matter fields in such a way that their gravitational effects are like those of two stars that are separated far apart but each is critically close to gravitational collapse .",
    "it is quite possible that such a simulation would not be plagued with the subtle problems that ocurr when one attempts to evolve two black holes .",
    "one could set the parameters of the simulation in such a way that when the two stars come close to each other , they collapse upon themselves and form two black holes . this final slice could be used as initial data for a binary black hole code .",
    "however in this paper , we consider the bishop _",
    "@xcite family of initial data wherein two non spinning kerr ",
    "schild black holes are superposed .",
    "this proposal has the property that in the `` close limit '' in which the separation of the holes is small , the metric is given by a distorted kerr - schild black hole .",
    "the evolution will be carried out using a recently introduced horizon penetrating teukolsky formalism @xcite .",
    "we present teukolsky waveforms from this evolution and the amount of energy radiated away by the system .",
    "the results we obtain are in agreement with those obtained by sarbach _",
    "@xcite from their evolution of the same initial data family using a kerr  schild type zerilli equation .",
    "for the sake of completion , in the first subsection of this section we reproduce the calculations followed by sarbach _",
    "@xcite for an exact solution of the linearized initial value problem .",
    "the ks space - time metric is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a null vector .",
    "the @xmath2 is taken to be the minkowski metric with coordinates @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the null vector @xmath1 satisfies @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . the three metric and extrinsic curvature with respect to a slice @xmath10",

    "s solution procedure @xcite consists in inserting equations [ eq - ksgk1 ] and [ eq - ksgk2 ] into the constraint equations and to solve the resulting equations for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is assumed to be given .",
    "here we review the discussion of equations [ eq - ksgk1 ] and [ eq - ksgk2 ] as followed by sarbach _",
    "_ where a particular ansatz is made for @xmath18 representing two nearby non - rotating and non - spinning black holes .",
    "a single schwarzschild black hole can be written as @xmath19 .",
    "for two black holes , bishop _",
    "_ choose @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the positions of the black holes that have mass @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "if the black holes are located at @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 may be expanded in a sum over multipoles : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote standard legendre polynomials and where @xmath31 are polar coordinates for @xmath32 .",
    "note that the expansion ( [ eq - twobhexp ] ) is only valid for @xmath33 .",
    "we define the separation parameter as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total mass .",
    "now , using the center of mass condition @xmath36 , the close limit of ( [ eq - twobhexp ] ) becomes @xmath37 as a result , to first order in @xmath38 , @xmath18 is given by @xmath39 where here and in the following , @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining amplitudes are expanded according to @xmath41 plugging this into the constraint equations , and keeping only linear terms ( of the order @xmath38 ) , one obtains the equations @xmath42 here , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "the system ( [ eq - c2],[eq - c3 ] ) can be re - expressed as a single second order equation . introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ", this equation reads @xmath46 once we have solved this equation , the remaining amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 are obtained from ( [ eq - c1 ] ) and ( [ eq - c2 ] ) , respectively . + a particular solution of ( [ eq - keyeq ] ) is given by @xmath49 in order to find the solutions of the homogeneous equation , one performs the transformations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which yields the bessel differential equation @xmath52 the solutions are a linear combination of the bessel functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the general solution to ( [ eq - keyeq ] ) is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 choices for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are discussed in the following section .",
    "the initial data for the metric and extrinsic curvature obtained above will be evolved using the ks type , penetrating teukolsky equation .",
    "this equation was derived by campanelli _",
    "@xcite in order to study gravitational perturbations close to the horizon .",
    "the equation , along with the associated geometrical quantity , the newman - penrose complex null - tetrad is regular at the horizon , and therefore has the capability of evolving through it .",
    "such an equation is ideal to study the effects of `` excision '' as used by full numerical , binary black hole collision codes , like maya @xcite",
    ". it should be noted , that the penetrating teukolsky equation is based on a rescaling of the transformed kinnersley tertrad ( to ks coordinates ) .",
    "this rescaling enables the tetrad to be regular at the horizon .",
    "therefore , the penetrating teukolsky equation is not just the original teukolsky equation in ks coordinates ..",
