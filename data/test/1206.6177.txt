    "differential - algebraic equations ( dae ) systems arise naturally when modelling many dynamic systems .",
    "dynamic process models and their properties form the background of any process control activity including model analysis , model parameter and structure estimation , diagnosis , regulation or optimal control .",
    "in particular , the structural analysis of dynamic lumped process models forms an important step in the model building procedure @xcite , and it is used for the determination of the solvability properties of the model .",
    "furthermore , the dynamic lumped process models often require the consistent initial conditions and solution of high - index differential - algebraic systems .",
    "the index is a notion used in the theory of daes for measuring the distance from a dae to its related ode .",
    "high - index dae systems need prolongation ( differentiation ) to reveal all the system s constraints , and to determine consistent initial conditions .",
    "the key steps include identifying all hidden constraints on formal power series solutions in the neighborhood of a given point , and are required to prepare the system for numerical integration .",
    "so for such differential systems , prolongation is unavoidable . in the present work ,",
    "pryce developed a taylor series method based on his structural analysis method @xcite and on pantelides work in @xcite .",
    "pantelides method gives a systematic way to reduce high - index systems of differential - algebraic equations to lower index , by selectively adding differentiated forms of the equations already present in the system .",
    "it is implemented in several significant equation - based simulation programs such as gproms @xcite , modelica @xcite and emso @xcite .",
    "however , the algorithm can fail in some instances .",
    "pryce s structural analysis is based on solving an assignment problem , which can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem .",

    "propose the structural analysis of process models using their representation graphs for the determination of the most important solvability property of lumped dynamic models : the differential index .",
    "their graph - theoretical method depends on the change in the relative position of underspecified and overspecified subgraphs and has an effect to the value of the differential index for complex models .",
    "if these subgraphs move further from their original positions the value of differential index increases . in this paper , we consider other approaches for the structural analysis of dynamic lumped process models for high - index dae systems .",
    "in particular , we consider pryce s method and the symbolic differential elimination package rifsimp .",
    "pryce s method is a robust and reliable method for remedying the drawback of the approach @xcite and doing so automatically .",
    "this is a powerful way to determine the index of the system , its number of degrees of freedom , and exactly which components should be given initial values .",
    "the key idea is taken from pryce s signature - method .",
    "the nice feature of the work is a simple and straightforward method for analysing the structure of a differential algebraic system .",

    "determine the offsets of the problem , which are the vectors @xmath10 , the smallest such that @xmath11 , for all @xmath12 with equality on the hvt .",
    "this problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem ( lpp ) in the variables @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 :    @xmath15    the structural index is then defined as    @xmath16    the structural index is no less that the differential index on first order dae .",
    "form the @xmath17 system jacobian matrix @xmath18 where    @xmath19    step 5 . choose a consistent point .",
    "if @xmath18 is non - singular at that point , then the solution can be computed with taylor series or numerical homotopy continuation techniques in a neighborhood of that point .",

    "the key idea of algorithm is substitution and differential elimination , which requires a ranking to be defined on the dependent variables and their derivatives .",
    "a basic step of differential elimination algorithms linearly appearing is to write the system in solved form with respect to each highest ranked derivative .",
    "it is treated by methods involving a combination of gr@xmath45ber bases and triangular decompositions .",
    "another key step in such algorithms is the taking of integrability conditions between equations .",
    "the rifsimp algorithm is essentially an extension of the gaussian elimination to daes and systems of nonlinear pdes .",
    "it differentiates the leading nonlinear equations and then reduce them with respect to the leading linear equations . if zero is obtained , it means that the equation is a consequence of the leading linear equations .",
    "if not , it means that this equation is a new constraint to the system .",
