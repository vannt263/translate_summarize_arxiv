    "in this pages there is an attempt to design and describe a naturalistic experiment on syntax acquisition .",
    "specifically , we want to build a _ syntactic network _ in order to study syntax with modern methods of complex network theory .",
    "the process is nor standard neither straightforward and deserves to be well described .",
    "there are interesting descriptive frameworks based on networks to study syntax .",
    "one of them is the so - called _",
    "dependency grammar_@xcite .",
    "there are , also , theoretical approaches using graphs .",
    "a remarkable member is the _ word grammar_@xcite .",
    "the approach assumed here is closer to the word - grammar , despite we develop our own criteria , as well as we consider the graph representation as a linear projection of the constituency hierarchy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we firstly discuss the scope and validity of the conceptualization of syntactic relations within a network .",
    "the core of the work is devoted to the discussion of the ( descriptive ) structural criteria to tackle the problem of annotation in early grammars . finally , a brief compendium of network measures is shown , as well as an illustrating example .",
    "all analysis are performed over the peter corpora of childes database @xcite using the dga - annotator @xcite .",
    "every abstraction of a natural object implies a particular conception of it in order to answer a specific question .",
    "assuming that every abstraction implies a simplification , we have to explore , then , how different approaches can be complementary or whether some of these approaches are more fruitful than others -i.e .",
    ", what are the core questions leading to the understanding of such phenomena .",
    "focusing on language , research on syntax seeks to find the minimal set of rules that could generate all -and only- the potentially infinite set of sentences of a given language .",
    "thus , the question addressed by syntax is the problem of decidability or computability of the set of possible sentences of a given language",
    ". when dealing with language as a complex network , we have to note that statistical physics works from different perspectives : what are the global features of the dynamics of our system ? how the combinatorial space is filled ?",
    "what is -if any- the role of constraints ?",
    "thus , we do nt address questions concerning the structure of the inhabitants -sentences- of our system , but its global dynamics and organization .",
    "note that the questions are different than in the case of syntax : thus , the abstraction we are working in is also different .",
    "note , also , that we are not negating nor denying the particular features of sentence construction . simply , we work at other level of abstraction",
    ". we are confident that information from this different level of approach should be enlightening to questions addressed on grammar itself .",
    "if one wants to apply statistics on some syntactic phenomena , a word of caution is needed because there is a gap between the syntactic procedure and the statistical physics procedure : the former is focused on explaining almost _ every _ subtlety of sentence construction , while the latter works on averages over the largest possible set of data .",
    "thus , a compromise has to be assumed because it is not possible to deal with every syntactic phenomena but , also , the statistics has to be built on certain criteria .",
    "thus , the aim of this document is to present a set of descriptive criteria to identify _ structure _ in early child grammars .",
    "this is not a theoretical reflection about the concept _ structure _ or its evolution during the process of language acquisition . with these criteria ,",
    "we want to build up the so - called syntactic networks from early child grammars .",
    "indeed , even though many features of the language acquisition process have been identified and well studied , there is a lack of a clear concept of what it is structured or not in early child grammars , namely , there is not a concept such as grammaticality @xcite or _ convergence _",
    "@xcite , defined in adult grammars .",
    "if we take the adult - grammar concept of grammaticality , we will surely reject almost all of children s productions .",
    "but it will not be true that many of these rejected utterances are unstructured at all .    in order to overcome these limitations",
    ", we developed a set of descriptive criteria to extract the syntactic network of different sets of the child s utterances belonging to successive time stages of the language acquisition process . as we discussed above , we present these criteria employed in the construction of the associated networks .",
    "formally speaking , a given language , @xmath0 is composed of an arbitrary large , but finite set of lexical items @xmath1 - or alphabet , in technical words- and of a restricted set of rules and axioms , @xmath2 .",
    "these rules describe how the elements from @xmath3 can be combined in order to _",
    "1_. obtain sentences of @xmath4 or to _ 2_. decide if a given sequence of elements from @xmath3 is a sentence of @xmath0 or not @xcite .",
    "syntax properties are , thus , indicators of grammatical complexity . if one intends to develop a syntax theory to decide whether a given sequence of words -namely , russian words- is a sentence of _ russian _ language , one needs to develop rules involving hierarchical and long range relations",
    ". moreover , the set of rules must be _ generative _ , in the sense that they should involve some recursive condition to grasp the potential infinity of sentences generated by russian grammar @xcite .",
    "thus , we can say , without any loose of generalization , that syntax works at the _ local level _ of language ] , i.e.it operates at the sentence level , no matter how long the sentence is . now , we wonder about the global profiles of syntactic relations .",
    "note that the question we want to address is not finding the specific rules needed to generate the possible sentences of @xmath0 , but we want to take a look at the system as a whole .",
    "this could seem bizarre when considered from the point of view of mainstream theories of syntax , but it is a common procedure in statistical physics .",
    "global profiles can provide information about general dynamics and constraints acting over the whole system as a complex entity .",
    "the unexpected profile given by zipf s law is an example of global behavior of language dynamics @xcite",
    ".    a note must be added concerning the naturalistic character of this kind of experiments .",
    "syntax has been related with competence abilities . but",
    "statistical and naturalistic works are carried out over performance data .",
    "thus , we are inferring the global patterns of performance by assuming some competence abilities .",
    "networks revealed as an interesting abstraction to explore the global behavior and dynamics of complex real systems made from units and the associated relations between such units .",
    "let s explore such abstraction for syntax relations . a network @xmath5 is defined by the nodes @xmath6 and the links @xmath7 relating the nodes @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these links can be directed or undirected ; we will use the directed ones , if the contrary is not indicated . to build a syntactic network",
    ", the mapping of @xmath8 onto a graph will be straightforward for the set @xmath9 i.e. , the set of lexical items of @xmath8 will be the set of nodes of @xmath10 .",
    "the mapping from @xmath2 to @xmath7 is not so obvious and needs further considerations .",
    "as we discussed above , the syntactic rules needed to generate any natural language revealed considerable degree of complexity .",
    "thus , it is clear that the statistical treatment employed here is an approximation .",
    "modern syntax is based on recursive operations of _ merge _ and _ move _ @xcite .",
    "such operations lead the syntactic derivations to display hierarchies and long range relations .",
    "these are features that can not be captured explicitly by a descriptive framework based on linear relations among lexical items -a network approach .",
    "but we are approaching the language structure from the point of view of statistical physics : we want to capture the global patterns of the system , thus we can not specify _ all _ the local properties .",
    "this is contrary to the procedure employed in the ising models of ferromagnetism , despite the success of this approach is universally acknowledged .",
    "thus we have to decide what is the most essential structure in a syntactic derivation .",
    "we assume that the most fundamental thing one can say from the syntactic point of view about a sentence is its _",
    "constituent structure_.    constituent structure can be captured by linear relations . in the following ,",
    "we define an exact mapping from a hierarchical binary tree to a graph , an entity made of binary relations ( see figure ( [ grafets ] ) ) :    1 .",
    "find the basic syntactic structure of constituents without labels nor internal operations , with clear distinctions of complements and the head in every phrase .",
    "detect the verbs in finite forms .",
    "2 .   trace an arc from the complement to the head of the phrase .",
    "if the complement of a given phrase is also a phrase , trace and arc from the head of the internal phrase to the head of the external phrase .",
    "we want to recover the merging order .",
    "3 .   the head will be the semantically most relevant item .",
    "the verbs in finite forms are the head of the sentence .    with the above criteria",
    ", we make an attempt to manage data with the less aggressive criteria .",
    "moreover , these assumptions do nt constrain us to one or other linguistic school and grasp reasonably with the observed syntactic development of children .    with this method",
    ", we do not restrict our set of sentences to the one generated by finite combinatorics .",
    "we allow our sentence to be arbitrary long .",
    "thus , our model is only finite because real data is finite in nature , but it does nt negate the theoretical possibility of infinite generativity , a property expected for any approach of syntax @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relevance of the statistical physics properties generally is found in systems asymptotically large .",
    "chi : [ telephone go right here ] ( ... ) + chi : xxx [ need it ] [ my need it ] ( ... ) + chi : xxx ( ... ) + chi : [ put in there ] +   +   + + + + +   + right@xmath11there@xmath11go@xmath12telephone+ it@xmath11need@xmath12my+in@xmath11there@xmath11put +   +        syntactic networks can be built by other procedures .",
    "dependency syntax @xcite has been used in other works @xcite . in such an approximation ,",
    "syntactic networks have been built up by assuming syntactic relations as dependency relations among lexical items .",
    "dependency grammar generates a graph to describe the sentence structure and it is the reason why it is interesting to build networks .",
    "the mechanism to build large nets is straightforward .",
    "studies on language acquisition can be divided into two main types : _ experimental _ and _ naturalistic_. the experimental ones are focused on child s response to well - established situations in order to obtain data of some specific trait .",
    "naturalistic studies , at the other hand , are based on child s free speech corpora .",
    "these corpora can be extracted , for example , from a recorded session where the child speaks with adults spontaneously .",
    "@xcite . our study is clearly naturalistic , and this label takes here its whole meaning , because the procedures to build up _ biological _ networks , for example , are conceptually , the same .",
    "data has been extracted from the well - known _ childes database _ @xcite .",
    "the chosen corpus is the _ peter _",
    "corpus , from bloom 1970 .",
    "we choose this data for many reasons : 1 ) time intervals are regular ( about 2 or 3 weeks ) .",
    "2 ) extension of the corpora can be considered large enough to seize global properties , taking into account the intrinsic small size of the system .",
    "there is a little exception in corpus 2 , which is , by far , the smallest one .",
    "fortunately , this corpus does not seem to belong to a key stage in grammar evolution .",
    "3 ) the acquisition stages of peter seem to be the standard ones observed in language acquisition .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to think that our results will not be biased to strange deviations of the particular case study .",
    "working data includes the 11th first corpora of peter s 20 corpora .",
    "the age period goes from 1 year and 9 months to 2 year and 4 months . as we said above",
    ", the aim of the study is to observe whether and to what extent syntactic networks can provide information on the process of language acquisition . the so - called _ syntactic spurt _ ( @xcite ) , which appears later than the _ lexical spurt _ , is clearly observable in the chosen corpora .",
    "thus , we manage data that begins when the lexical spurt has already taken place and ends when syntactic structures of child s productions are complex enough to be compared with the adult ones . this does not exclude the possibility of more abrupt changes in more advanced acquisition stages , but we stop our analysis here .",
    ".age of peter in successive corpora ( * years;months.days * ) .",
    "data from childes database @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath13    the case concerning _ a _ , the schwa , will receive a particular attention below .",
    "some onomatopoeia appear together with its corresponding lexical item .",
    "to analyze them , we assume onomatopoeia to be nonexistent .",
    "take , for example : @xmath13    * peter 9*_i want ta write the choo choo train @xmath14 i want ta write the train _    @xmath13 considerations related to other non - trivial interpretations , such as the role of _ ta _ , are extensively developed in the following lines .    in addition , and following the enumeration of non - accepted productions , we find the general case where no structure is identified in a production . in this situation , we consider the utterance as a string of isolated lexical items .",
    "consequently , no links but only nodes corresponding to the lexical items are added to the graph .",
    "more attention has to be paid to imitations .",
    "the reason to consider imitations as unacceptable productions is that we have no confidence that such string is identified as a structured one or , simply , as a single lexical element .",
    "imitations are identified by analyzing the discursive context",
    ". some utterances of surprising complexity for its corresponding stage are produced after an _ untranscribed adult conversation _ : we cautiously removed from the graph such contributions . in peter 5 corpus , _ i ca nt see it _ is produced after an adult conversation and it is , by far , the most complex production of this corpus .",
    "it strongly suggests that this is an imitation from something said in such untranscribed adult conversation .",
    "as we stated above , structured productions and lexical items are taken into account .",
    "now we state another assumption : if in the whole utterance we can not find global structure but there are some structured strings , then we take these structured strings separately , ( see figure [ grafets ] ) .      in the pre - functional stage ( identified in our data until corpus",
    "peter 6 ) there appear a lot of utterances where only thematic relations seem to be considered by the syntactic system of the child .",
    "thematic relations are fundamental at the syntactic level , and their appearance indicates presence of sub - categorization mechanisms in child grammar .",
    "no traces of more complex structure -like agreement- is found in this early stage of acquisition .",
    "we consider as syntactic relations the thematic relations between verb and arguments .",
    "moreover , subject elision is usual , due mainly to the facts that 1)utterances are in imperative mode or 2)there is no fixation yet of parametric variation associated to the explicit presence of subject in english .",
    "productions of this kind are : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ open box _ , instead of _ open the box _",
    ", ( the determiner is missing . )",
    "@xmath13    * peter 5 * _ wheel walk _ instead of _",
    "the wheel walks _ , ( 3-singular english agreement is missing ) @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ two truck _ instead of _ two trucks _ , ( no plural agreement )    @xmath13    this leads to the logical conclusion that productions like _ open the _ will not be accepted .",
    "the reason is clear : if we assume thematic relations as the basic building blocks of child syntax , the non - presence of the semantically required argument but its determiner is not enough to define any relation .",
    "relations between verbal head and functional words are specifically considered in phrasal verbs .",
    "its isolated production is considered a structured utterance .",
    "several reasons support our choice : 1 ) their intrinsic complex nature , 2 ) we can not conclude that there are lexicalized imitations because , in adult speech , phrasal verbs usually are _ broken _ by a noun or determiner phrase : @xmath13    _ turn [ the wheel]@xmath15 out_. @xmath13      semantically vacuous predications ( those which involve the _ to be _ verb ) are often produced without realization the verb .",
    "we argued that missing arguments or lack of agreement in a production could be not the only reasons to conclude that there is not any structure in child utterances .",
    "this was justified because strong semantically items were present in discussed productions .",
    "the case of copulative constructions will be treated close to the ones involving missing functional words . in this case , no presence of the verb does not motivate the consideration of non - structured production .",
    "an interesting production is : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ wheels mine _ instead of _ * the * wheels * are * mine _",
    "@xmath13 in this case we have a predication _ mine _ from something _",
    "wheels_. formally , _ are _ is a semantic link between predication and the element from which something is predicated @xcite .",
    "so the missing of the _ to be _ verb could be considered analogous to the missing of a functional particle .",
    "the same situation arises from : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ that my pen _",
    "@xmath13 usually , when inflectional morphology appears , some infinite forms are present without the finite form of the _ to be _ verb .",
    "this is the case of some present continuous utterances such as : @xmath13    * peter 8 * _ i writting",
    "_    @xmath13 this case should be treated as the above case : there is some predication with semantic structure .",
    "just the opposite is also found : presence of the _ to be _ verb with an infinitive or finite form : @xmath13    * peter 8 * _ i m write too",
    "_    @xmath13 in this case , we could assume that the child is acquiring inflectional morphology and that this utterance is a present continuous one without inflection .",
    "in the other hand , we could consider that _",
    "m _ has not a role in the sentence and thus , this can be treated as a single finite sentence _",
    "i write too_.    analogously , @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ i m do it _    or    * peter 6 * _ cars goes away _",
    "@xmath13 are treated as single finite sentences : _",
    "i do it _ and _ the cars go away _    some lexicalized phrases in adult language , such as _ back seat _ or _ thank you _ , have been considered as a complex structures .",
    "the reason is to be coherent : if we assume that _ fix it _ is clearly an imperative structured sentence , at this stages of acquisition there is no reason to think that _ back seat _ or _",
    "thank you _ have to be considered differently .",
    "moreover , this interpretation is also coherent with the one developed for phrasal verbs .",
    "a special case of imitations involving the _ to be _ verb will be accepted .",
    "these imitations involve some _ adaptation _ of adult syntax to the syntax in which the child is competent .",
    "an example should be : @xmath13    * ( peter 6 ) *    * adult * : _ is that a truck ? _ @xmath13    * child*@xmath16 : _ that s a truck ?",
    "_ @xmath13",
    "* child*@xmath17 : _ that a truck ? _",
    "@xmath13    in this example , adult production involve an interrogative sentence with subject inversion . the first imitation ( _ child_@xmath16 ) retains all the lexical items but the sentence is translated as interrogative without subject inversion . in the second successive imitation ( _ child_@xmath17 ) the verb is missing .",
    "but the elements to define a predication are still at work -with a _ schwa _ as a determiner , suggesting that the child is entering into the functional stage .      during the acquisition process ,",
    "extension of meaning is subject to variations . to know which is the intrinsic nature of these changes is not our aim , but we have to manage such situations .",
    "thus , we find utterances where the child uses in the _ wrong _ way some lexical item that could be related semantically with the _ right _ lexical item . as an example : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ more screwdriver _",
    "@xmath13 which could , checking the context , be properly replaced by constituents or lexical items with related meanings : @xmath13    _ another screwdriver _",
    "@xmath13 or    _ screw it again _",
    "@xmath13 or    _ screw it more _ ( or _ harder _ ... )    @xmath13 in the first case , we could consider that the child made some semantic extension of the word _",
    "more _ and it has enough traces to define a syntactic relation . but context can lead us to a second or third interpretation . generally , if there is a great ambiguity we reject such utterances as structured ones .",
    "in this case , we should not consider any syntactic structure .",
    "thus , we do nt define any relation in productions such as : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ screwdriver help _ @xmath13",
    "* peter 5 * _ more [ fix it]@xmath18 _ ( we do nt define any relation between    @xmath19_more _ and the sd _ fix it _ )    @xmath13 the semantics of the productions are intuitive , but is hard to justify clearly some kind of syntactic dependency .",
    "strings displaying mistakes in the use of personal pronouns and possessives have considered as structured . generally , we could associate such mistakes to the absence or weakness of case system .",
    "but many productions , as we reported above , have structure without any trace of case assignation .",
    "examples of this kind of utterances are : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ my fix it_@xmath20instead of _ i fix it _ @xmath13    * peter 8 * _ me write_@xmath21 instead of _ i write _",
    "@xmath13    this assumption is reinforced by realizing that , in some cases , a production with wrong pronoun is repeated correctly without any conversational pause : @xmath13    * peter 8 * _ me found it ( ... ) i find it _ @xmath13",
    "this situation can not be confused with the missing of the _ to be _ verb such in the case of _ wheels mine_. this case has to be considered as above mentioned when dealing with missing _ to be _ verb structures .      in early corpora ( 1 - 4 )",
    "child productions display very poor structures .",
    "this is the so - called _ pre - functional _ stage , where no functional words appear in structured productions . beyond this point , some lexical elements -we are mainly talking about the @xmath22 , the _",
    "schwa_- seem to act as a _ proto_functional particles . whether this schwa has a phonological or functional - syntactic character is an open question @xcite .",
    "some authors related the presence of these items as one step to combinatorial speech @xcite , but they realized that , in early stages , the role of these items is more related to phonological processes of language acquisition , without any functional or structural role , at the syntactic level .",
    "other authors such as veneziano @xmath23 sinclair `` _ linked these phenomena more specifically to the child s development of grammatical morphemes considering them as a sort of an intermediate form on the way to grammatical morphemes . _ '' @xcitepp 463 . roughly speaking",
    ", we can say that the core of this reasoning is rooted in the idea that the role of such items is dynamic , going at very first stages as _ filler syllabes _ without any syntactic role and acquiring grammatical features during the process to end as functional particles , with specific syntactic role .",
    "the lack of consensus around a topic that seems to be crucial in syntactic acquisition theorizations forces us to be really cautious in interpreting such items .",
    "furthermore , functional words such @xmath22 are strongly candidates to be the hubs in a fully developed syntactic network .",
    "hub are the most connected nodes on a network , being , thus core pieces in network organization .",
    "every candidate belonging to the set of functional particles is specially analyzed in order to discard simple phonological phenomena .",
    "thus , for every occurrence of such items there will be an individual decision , taking in account the context and with the framework defined by veneziano @xmath23 sinclair .",
    "sinclair s study , the chosen language is french , but we take as general some conclusions that seem to coincide with the observed phenomena in english acquisition ]    specifically , we considered that sometimes the _ schwa _ plays a functional role .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , thus , that sometimes the _ schwa _ is substituting a specific functional particle . in this cases",
    "we assume that the _ schwa _ acts within the syntactic structure as the substituted particle .",
    "several examples can illustrate such reasoning : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ light * a * hall _ @xmath13",
    "* peter 6 * _ light in * a * hall _ @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ look * a * people",
    "_ @xmath13    in this case",
    ", it seems that _ a _ substitutes _ the_. _ * a * _ should be treated as a determiner .",
    "this is a very difficult choice , because purely phonological interpretation could be enough to justify the presence , specially in the third case .",
    "sometimes choice is really ambiguous .",
    "take for example : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ there * a * new one _ @xmath13    such a case _ * a * _ could be easily interpreted as a pure phonological phenomena .",
    "but if we consider the vacuous semantic nature of the _ to be _ verb , we could understand these occurrences as protofunctionals .",
    "we removed these most ambiguous cases .",
    "we also rejected as unstructured utterances productions involving confuse sequences of functional particles as : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ will an a in there _ @xmath13    any interpretation is really confusing .",
    "there are cases where the presence of the _ * a * _ is clearly purely phonological .",
    "for example : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ more get * a * more _",
    "@xmath13    * peter 6 * _ * a * ride a horsie _ @xmath13    * peter 5*_*a * this thumb _",
    "@xmath13    * peter 7 * _ hmmm my a _",
    "@xmath13    beyond the non - definition of personal pronouns due to the weakness of the case system , we find the pronoun _",
    "i _ as an _ a _ : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ a want milk _ @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ a want ta get out _ @xmath13    an interesting sequence of that reinforces our considerations",
    "is : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ a put it on ( ... ) my put it on _",
    "@xmath13    finally , it is interesting to note the presence of elements that are , to some extent , a mixing between _ a _ and _ to _ : _ ta_. the occurrence of this particle is rare and located explicitly at the very beginning of the funcional stage .",
    "the remarkable fact lies on the evidence that is located where it should be the preposition _ to_. this could imply that in fact there is a transition from a pure phonological role to a functional one .",
    "_ a @xmath14 ta @xmath14 to _ @xmath13    thus , we interpret _ ta _ as an intermediate stage but , due to its location within the sentence and the context , we assume it behaves as a preposition : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ [ have [ ta [ screw it]]@xmath24 _ @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ [ have[ta [ screw it]]@xmath24 _ @xmath13",
    "the emergence of english syntax is strongly tied to the emergence of functional particles .",
    "this is the reason why we decided to take into account this kind of lexical components : despite almost every utterance involving such items can be object of many considerations , there are enough motivation to try to define a descriptive criteria to deal with them .",
    "it is usual to find , at the beginning of the functional stage , that a verb that sub - categorizes , for example , a prepositional phrase , display two successive prepositions : @xmath13    * peter 6 * _ look * at in * there _ @xmath13    to manage this kind of productions we assumed , first , that these imply that the child conceives a syntactic structure that involves prepositional phrases . following this reasoning , we make the following structural description : @xmath13    _ look * at in * there _ @xmath14 _ [ look [ at there]@xmath24 _",
    "@xmath13    in that case , _ in _ is interpreted as an independent lexical item .",
    "not only prepositions are involved in this duplication phenomena , but also determiners : @xmath13    * peter 9 * _ one that screwdriver _ @xmath13    interpretation rules out _",
    "one _ as a member of any structure , leading the sd _ [ that screwdriver]@xmath15 _ alone .",
    "a situation analogous to famous one described by braine ( p.160 - 161 ) @xcite is : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ get * another * one paper @xmath14 get another paper _ @xmath13    thus , as above , determiner duplication is not considered in the structural analysis .      by this name ,",
    "we designate the lexical items that are present in a conversational framework but can not be explicitly interpreted as members of some syntactic structure , such as _ hello _ , or_ok_. the reason to include these elements as connected to the network is due mainly because their are produced in non - arbitrary context .",
    "thus , we assume that they linked to the first element of the sentence they precede : @xmath13    * peter 5 * _ ok patsy _",
    "@xmath13    obviously , previous reasons are at work when dealing with such items .",
    "thus , the conversational context has to be analyzed to interpret these items .",
    "for example , in the following situation , _",
    "bye _ has not been considered as a member of any structure .",
    "the reason is that it is produced among analogous expressions , leading it to interpret more in a pragmatic sense : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ see you , bye , see you _",
    "@xmath13    sequences of numbers or other elements produced as a list are not considered as members of any structure : @xmath13    * peter 7 * _ one two three ... _",

    "there are other situations where we considered suitable not to consider _ no _ as a member of any structure : @xmath13    * peter 8 * _ in the bag * no * _",
    "@xmath13    we can not conclude that there is a syntactic relation among the negation operator and some other lexical item of the string .",
    "maybe a parametric @xcite hypotheses could save this production by suggesting that the location of the negation operator within the structure may be a parametric feature .",
    "despite interesting , we choose the rule these productions out for reliability purposes .",

    "in the latter case , as before , we considered not risky to identify _ no _ as a member of a bigger structures sentence .",
    "previous set of criteria enables us :    1 .   to identify and characterize syntactic structures in early child language .",
    "2 .   to project them into word - word dependencies in order to annotate the corpus .    the corpora is annotated _ by hand_. this enables us to be accurate and to manage ambiguous situations .",
    "the program used to perform the annotation is the so - called * dependency grammar annotator * ( dga annotator ) .",
    "this program was developed by marius popescu @xcite from the university of bucaresti and has a nice and easy interface .",
    "it works with xml files , whose internal structure will be described in the example of the last section .",
    "with these criteria in hand , we are ready to perform a first analysis of grammar complexity .",
    "such an analysis is closed to the classical mlu .",
    "what we can compute , now is the average size of syntactic structures .",
    "thus , in a production , we can , for example , find two syntactically unrelated structures@xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". the number of lexical items of these structures will be its sizes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "such an utterance will contribute to the computation of @xmath25 with two structures .",
    "for example , in @xmath13    _ look * at in * that _",
    "@xmath13    we have two structures :    @xmath30[look , [ at , that ] ] @xmath31    @xmath32 in @xmath33    @xmath34    ( note that single words are considered as size-@xmath35 structures ) to obtain @xmath25 the average is computed over all utterances .",
    "such a measure will provide us clues to decide whether the size of productions has information about grammatical complexity .",
    "its evolution can be related with working memory limitations .",
    "once we analyzed a conversation , we can build the network .",
    "the process is as follows .",
    "due to the nature of our analysis , we will have a collection of words , which define the set @xmath36 :    @xmath37    this define the set of nodes of our network . if , during the conversation , we find some structure where two words @xmath38 are related syntactically -using the above criteria!- we say that @xmath39 and that there is a link @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41    remark that :    all the words and links only appear once a time .",
    "this enables us to separate -as far as possible- some contextual deviations from the specific conversations .",
    "also , there can be many isolated nodes .",
    "finally , we compute the adjacency matrix @xmath42 . this matrix is the representation of the graph and the abstract object where all computations of graph complexity are performed .",
    "if the child produced @xmath43 different words during the conversation , the size of this matrix will be , obviously @xmath44 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of the directed graph will be :    @xmath45    if we consider the undirected version of this graph , @xmath46 will be defined as :    @xmath47    note that @xmath46 is symmetrical , whereas @xmath42 it is not .",
    "now we are ready to perform an exhaustive analysis of network complexity .",
    "a first and fundamental question we find when dealing with such measures is whether the net is made of a large number or small , isolated graphs or if it displays a clearly differentiated giant connected component ( gcc ) that contains most of the connected words -i.e .",
    "words syntactically active in some production .",
    "the number of words contained on such a component or its relative size are interesting statistical indicators . strikingly , from the very beginning , child s syntactic graphs display a clear and very differentiated gcc . for mathematical purposes , we will use the matrix representation of the connectivity pattern of the gcc , the so - called _ adjacency matrix_. an element of such a matrix is @xmath48 if there exists a link among the words @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 otherwise . if the contrary is not indicated , -we will compute the following measures over the gcc of our graphs .",
    "the number of links ( or _ degree _ ) @xmath52 of a given word @xmath53 gives a measure of the number of ( syntactic ) relations existing between a word and its neighbors .",
    "the simplest global measure that can be defined on @xmath54 is the average degree @xmath55 . for the @xmath56-th corpus",
    ", it will be defined as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 indicates the number of words present in the @xmath56-th corpus .",
    "this number is known to increase through acquisition in a steady manner .",
    "this and other measures are computed on the largest component of the graph .    beyond the average degree , two basic measures can be used to characterize the graph structure of the gcc of the @xmath56-th corpus .",
    "these are the average path length ( @xmath59 ) and the clustering coefficient ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the first is defined as @xmath61 over all pairs @xmath62 , where @xmath63 indicates the length of the shortest path between two nodes .",
    "roughly speaking , a short path length means that it is easy to reach a given word @xmath64 starting from another arbitrary word @xmath65 .",
    "the second is defined as the probability that two vertices ( e.g. words ) that are neighbors of a given vertex are neighbors of each other . in order to compute the clustering ,",
    "we define for each word @xmath66 a neighborhood @xmath67 . each word @xmath68 has been syntactically linked ( via the above defined projection ) at least once with @xmath66 in some sentence .",
    "the words in @xmath67 can also be linked among them , and it is what the clustering coefficient evaluates .",
    "the clustering @xmath69 of this set is defined as    @xmath70    and the average clustering of the gcc concerning the @xmath56-th corpus is simply @xmath71 .",
    "the clustering @xmath72 provides a measure of the likelihood of having triangles in the graph . concerning the average path length , for random graphs with poissonian structure we have    @xmath73\\over \\log \\left [ z_2 /z_1\\right ] } \\ ] ]    being @xmath74 the average number of neighbors at distance @xmath43 . for poissonian graphs , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we have the following approximation : @xmath77",

    "when @xmath78 ( and clearly @xmath79 ) .",
    "the key difference between a poissonian network and a real network is often @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "another quantity of interest is the degree of affinity among nodes with the same connectivity . in this way , the behavior of hubs is specially relevant , as well as they organize the overall structure of the net .",
    "a network is said to be _ assortative _ if hubs tend to be connected among them .",
    "at the other side , a network is said to be _ dissassortative _ if hubs tend to avoid connections among them .",
    "language networks at different scales display a high degree of dissassortativeness @xcite . to quantify the degree of assortativeness",
    ", we use the so - called pearson s coefficient for nets @xcite :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the degrees of the edges at the ends of the @xmath84th edge with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and being @xmath87 the number of edges .",
