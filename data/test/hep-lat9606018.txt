    "we made our simulations at @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "we see a remarkably different behavior of the curl of the magnetic currents that is much smaller than in the other phase and at @xmath183 is consistent with zero everywhere .",

    "nevertheless while the data for the maximal abelian gauge support a non - vanishing value for the coherence length , there is no evidence for @xmath2 being different from zero in the polyakov gauge .    moreover",
    "a comparison between the two different projections shows that in the polyakov gauge the peak values of the electric field and of the curl of the magnetic currents are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the correspondent values in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "suzuki et .",
    "al.@xcite reported similarly that the string tension was suppressed in the polyakov gauge .    to understand these differences",
    "we remember that after abelian projection we are left not only with the abelian links but also with the coset vector fields .",
    "the dynamics of these doubly charged fields is clearly dependent on the choice of the abelian projection . to show the different role of the coset fields in the two projections , we measure the divergence of the electric field giving the spatial distribution of the electric charge .",

    "[ gauss ] we show the results for two polyakov lines separated by three lattice spacings .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the effective charge of the static source is much smaller in the polyakov gauge and that the coset fields in the two prescriptions respond in opposite ways to the presence of an electric charge with the fields in the polyakov gauge shielding the static charge .",
    "skala et al .",
    "have studied @xmath185 in su(3 ) in a gauge invariant formulation and conclude there is no screening @xcite .",
    "using the u(1 ) theory as a guide , we explore the connection between ( i ) the non - vanishing of a vacuum expectation value of the monopole field and ( ii ) vortex formation . item ( i ) provides the underlying principle , item ( ii ) gives direct evidence of a photon mass and confinement . in the abelian projection of su(2 ) @xmath186 u(1 ) there is an additional consideration . after identifying the u(1 ) gauge field ,",
    "there remain dynamical charged vector coset fields .",
    "they can screen the static sources and change the electric flux , affecting the string tension .    from prior work",
    "we know that , e.g. , the minimal abelian projection and the maximal abelian projection account for the physics of confinement through very different mechanisms .",
    "we anticipated that the monopoles in the polyakov projection would give a picture very similar to the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "however we found that the coset fields greatly suppress the static sources .",
    "it could be that we are much farther from the continuum limit than we thought .",
    "but that seems unlikely since other quantities are close to scaling values .",
    "our definitions of field strength , monopoles , static sources etc . have some leeway , but all should give the same continuum limit .",
    "or it could be that the dynamical variables arising from the polyakov abelian projection do not adequately separate the short distance and long distance physics .",
