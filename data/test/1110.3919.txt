    "recent advances in physics of ultracold quantum gases have opened a unique opportunity to study of low - dimensional quantum systems ( see , for example @xcite ) . in experiments with ultracold atoms and molecules",
    "the particle motion is  frozen \" along one or two variables by using the optical potential and its dynamics is limited to a plane or a line . in this case",
    ", the physical properties of the low - dimensional system can be dramatically altered under the action of the optical trap .",
    "moreover , one can effectively manage interatomic interactions by varying the parameters of the trap .",
    "this opens up new possibilities for studying strongly correlated quantum systems @xcite , few - body and many - body effects in low - dimensional systems @xcite , new mechanisms of molecule formation @xcite , and possible elements for quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of few - body systems , a quantum two - body system , acquires in a confined geometry of a 1d trap unique properties as compare to the conventional two - body problem in a 3d free space @xcite .",
    "confining of the motion in the transversal directions leads to transverse quantization of the motion and makes the pair collisions in a 1d trap essentially multichannel ones .",
    "possible transverse excitation energies of the particle define the channel thresholds for the scattering in the trap . depending on the initial conditions , the parameters of the trap and the interatomic interaction , different multichannel effects may occur at pair atomic collisions in the 1d confining trap .",
    "it is a confinement - induced resonance ( cir ) defined for zero - energy limit when the ground state energy threshold of the colliding pair coincides with the resonance in the closed transverse channel @xcite , transverse excitations / deexcitations during the collision @xcite , center - of - mass effects @xcite , a new mechanism for molecule formation @xcite , a cir - splitting in anisotropic traps @xcite , anharmonicity effects @xcite , and three - body effects @xcite .",
    "a quantitative description of the mentioned effects has demanded to develop new computational methods that we consider in the next section .",
    "some results obtained with the elaborated computational techniques are briefly discussed in the section 3 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section 4 .",
    "the collisional dynamics of two distinguishable atoms with coordinates @xmath0 and masses @xmath1 moving in the harmonic waveguide with the transverse potential @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is described by the 4d time - dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath4 ) @xcite @xmath5 with the hamiltonian @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 describe the center - of - mass ( cm ) and relative atomic motions .",
    "the potential @xmath9 describes the atom - atom interaction , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the polar radial cm and the relative coordinates and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the term @xmath14 represents the angular part of the kinetic energy operator of the relative atomic motion .",
    "the term @xmath15 in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) leads for two distinguishable atoms that feel different confining frequencies @xmath16 to a coupling of the cm and relative atomic motion , i.e. to the nonseparability of the quantum two - body problem in confined geometry of the 1d harmonic trap .",
    "the problem is to integrate the schrdinger equation from time @xmath17 to the asymptotic region @xmath18 with the initial wave - packet    @xmath19    representing two different noninteracting atoms in the transversal ground state of the waveguide with @xmath20 and the overall normalization constant @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 .",
    "we choose @xmath23 to be far from the origin @xmath24 and @xmath25 to obtain a narrow width in momentum and energy space for the initial wave - packet .",
    "the wave - packet moves with a positive interatomic velocity @xmath26 ( defined by the longitudinal colliding energy @xmath27 ) to the scattering region at @xmath24 and splits up after the scattering into two parts moving in opposite directions @xmath28 .",
    "if the initial conditions permit opening inelastic channels it can lead to the collisional excitation of the transverse vibrations@xcite or formation of molecular bound states @xcite .",
    "multichannel character of the scattering is also developing at the region of the cir where resonance in the closed channel leads to the resonant behaviour of the elastic scattering amplitude if the initial colliding energy coincides with the resonant energy of molecular state in the closed channel @xcite .    the modeling of the interatomic interaction @xmath9 was discussed in @xcite .",
    "for discretization of the angular part in ( 1 ) we apply the 2d nondirect discrete variable representation @xcite . for 1d quantum problems discrete variable representation ( dvr )",
    "was suggested in @xcite and broadly applied in the quantum chemistry computations @xcite .",
    "however , it happened that the attempts to extend this approach for the case of more higher dimensions as a direct product of 1d dvrs were not so efficient @xcite . in 1997",
    "we have suggested a 2d nondirect product dvr ( nddvr ) in application to the time - dependent 3d schrdinger equation describing hydrogen atom in a laser field of arbitrary polarization @xcite .",
    "the method happened to be very efficient in application to different few - dimensional quantum problems @xcite .",
    "mathematical aspects of the 2d nddvr were discussed recently in @xcite .    in the 2d nddvr",
    "we seek for the time - dependent solution @xmath29 of the problem ( 1 - 5 ) according to the expansion @xcite",

    "the @xmath38 mesh points are chosen as @xmath39 .",
    "the total number @xmath40 of grid points @xmath32 is equal to the number of basis functions in the expansion ( 6 ) and the number of terms in the definition ( 7 ) , where the symbol @xmath41 represents the twofold index @xmath42 and the sum over @xmath41 is equivalent to the double sum @xmath43 the @xmath44 and @xmath45 indexes show the number of zeros over @xmath33 and @xmath37 variables of the polynomials @xmath46 which we specify in the next paragraph .",
    "due to the definition ( 8) the values @xmath38 may be chosen only odd .",
    "@xmath34 can take on arbitrary values .",

    "the @xmath21 weights @xmath59 are the standard gauss - legendre weights multiplied by @xmath60 . for most @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath61 the above relation is automatically satisfied because the basis functions @xmath62 are orthogonal and the gaussian quadrature is exact . for these @xmath41 we have @xmath63 in eq.(9 ) .",

    "the fact , that values of the searching wave function @xmath29 at the grid points of the 2d angular space @xmath68 are utilized in the 2d nddvr , drastically simplifies the calculations@xcite as compared to the usual partial - wave analysis .",
    "it is an attractive feature of the 2d nddvr ( 6 - 10 ) that for the grid representation @xmath69 the only nondiagonal part of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is the angular part of the kinetic energy operator ( see eqs .",

    "the hamiltonian in ( 11 ) permits the splitting into the following three parts @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 subsequently we can approximate the time - step @xmath75 where @xmath76 according to @xmath81 @xmath82    the time evolution proceeds as follows . for the first and the last steps according to the relation ( 13 ) we write the function @xmath83 and the operators @xmath84 in our 2d nddvr ( 7 ) on the 2d grid @xmath85 .",
    "since the potential @xmath86 is diagonal in this representation the first and last steps represent simple multiplications of the diagonal matrices @xmath87 .",
    "two intermediate steps in ( 13 ) depending on @xmath88 and @xmath89 are treated in the basis @xmath90 ( 9 ) where the matrix operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 are diagonal with respect to the indices @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "for that we approximate the exponential operators according to @xmath93 which ensures the desired accuracy of the numerical algorithm ( 13 ) . thus , after the discretization of @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) with the help of finite - differences the matrix @xmath96 possesses a band structure and we arrive at the following boundary - value problems @xmath97 which can be solved rapidly due to the band structure of the matrix @xmath96 . this computational scheme is unconditionally stable @xcite , preserves unitarity and is very efficient , i.e. the computational time is proportional to the total number @xmath21 of grid points over the radial and angular variables @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the computational procedure is based on the fast transformation with help of the unitary matrix @xmath98 between the two relevant representations : the 2d nddvr ( 7 ) and the @xmath90-representation ( 9 ) .      in the case of the pair collisions of two identical atoms in harmonic trap",
    "the problem reduces to scattering of a single effective particle with the reduced mass @xmath99 , off a scatterer @xmath9 at the origin , under transverse harmonic confinement with frequency @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) @xcite @xmath102 \\psi ( \\mathbf{r } ) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\,\\,.\\ ] ] here the energy of the relative two - body motion @xmath103 is a sum of the transverse @xmath104 and longitudinal collision @xmath27 energies . due to our definition of the confining potential , the transverse excitation energies @xmath104 can take the possible values @xmath105 of the discrete spectrum of the 2d oscillator @xmath106 .",
    "the problem was in integration of the 3d stationary schrdinger equation ( 15 ) with the scattering asymptotic conditions @xmath107 at @xmath108 and finding the unknown matrix elements @xmath109 of the scattering amplitude , which describe transitions between the initial @xmath110 and final @xmath111 channels of scattering .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath110 of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator denote the transversal excitations / deexcitations @xmath112 of colliding atoms .",
    "in addition to the quantum number @xmath110 the asymptotic scattering state is defined also by the momentum @xmath113 of the channel @xmath114 the energy @xmath115 defines the number @xmath116 of open channels in ( [ asymp ] ) , where the longitudinal collision energy must be positive @xmath117 .",
    "it is clear that the scattering amplitude depends also on the index @xmath45 which , however , remains unchanged during the collision due to the axial symmetry of the problem .",
    "hereafter we consider only the case @xmath118 and the index is omitted in the following . due to the axial symmetry of the interactions in ( [ poth ] ) we separate the @xmath37-variable and",

    "first , we discretize the 2d schrdinger equation ( [ poth ] ) on a 2d grid of angular @xmath121 and radial @xmath122 variables . the angular grid points @xmath123 are defined as the zeroes of the legendre polynomial @xmath124 of the order @xmath34 . using the completeness property of the normalized legendre polynomials which remains valid also on the chosen angular grid @xmath125 where @xmath59 are the weights of the gauss quadrature , we expand the solution of equation ( [ poth ] ) in the basis @xmath126 according to @xmath127 here @xmath128 is the inverse of the @xmath129 matrix @xmath130 with the matrix elements defined as @xmath131 . due to this definition",
    "one can use the completeness relation ( [ completeness ] ) in order to determine the matrix elements @xmath132 as @xmath133 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ grid expansion of wave function ] ) that the unknown coefficients @xmath134 in the expansion are the values @xmath135 of the two - dimensional wave function @xmath136 at the grid points @xmath123 multiplied by @xmath137 . near the origin @xmath138 we have @xmath139 due to the definition ( [ grid expansion of wave function ] ) and the demand for the probability distribution @xmath140 to be bounded . substituting ( [ grid expansion of wave function ] ) into ( [ poth ] ) results a system of @xmath34 schrdinger - like coupled equations with respect to the @xmath34-dimensional unknown vector @xmath141 @xmath142\\mathbf{u}(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 @xmath144 and @xmath145 is the unit matrix .",

    "@xmath151 one can choose more adequate distributions of the grid points for specific interatomic and confining potentials .    by mapping the initial variable @xmath94 in eq.([sheroedinger - like equation ] ) onto @xmath152 we obtain @xmath153\\mathbf{u}(r(x))=0\\,\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath154 where @xmath155 the uniform grid with respect to @xmath152 gives 6-order accuracy for applying a 7-point finite - difference approximation of the derivatives in the equation ( [ sheroedinger - like equation2 ] ) .",

    "the reduction of the 2d multi - channel scattering problem to the finite - difference boundary value problem ( [ lu ] ) permits one to apply efficient computational methods .",

    "the block - diagonal structure of the matrix of the coefficients in the system of equations([lu ] ) with the width of the diagonal band equal to @xmath178 makes this computational scheme an efficient one .    solving the problem ( [ lu ] ) for the defined initial vector @xmath113 and a fixed @xmath110 from the possible set @xmath179 we first calculate the vector function @xmath180 .",
    "then , by matching the calculated vector @xmath181 with the asymptotic behaviour ( [ asymp ] ) at @xmath182 , we calculate the @xmath110-th row of the scattering amplitude matrix @xmath109 describing all possible transitions @xmath183 .",
    "this procedure is repeated for the next @xmath110 from @xmath184 and over upon calculating all the elements @xmath109 of the scattering amplitude .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss some of the most interesting results obtained with the developed computational methods .      in our work @xcite it was shown that the quantum dynamics of the coupled center - of - mass and relative motion for two different colliding atoms in a harmonic trap exhibits a resonant formation process of ultracold molecules . with the developed splitting - up method ( section 2.3 ) , permitting to treat quantitatively the collision in the 4d configuration space @xmath185 , we have analyzed in detail the quantum dynamics of the process and demonstrated the existence of a novel mechanism for the resonant formation of polar molecules .",
    "the origin of this effect is the confinement - induced mixing ( 4 ) of the relative and center - of - mass motions in the atomic collision process leading to a coupling of the diatomic continuum to center - of - mass excited molecular states in closed transverse channels .",
    "the process is illustrated by fig.1 where the probability density distribution averaged over the angular variables @xmath186 is given as a function of time .    .",

    "@xmath192 , time is given in units of @xmath193 . ]    for @xmath194 ( different atoms  feel \" different frequencies @xmath195 and @xmath196 in the trap ) we observe that a considerable part of the scattered wave - packet ( see the probability density distribution @xmath197 at @xmath189 ) is located near origin @xmath198 after the collision and corresponds to a molecular bound state with excitation of the molecular center - of - mass .",
    "it is first excited state with respect to the center - of - mass motion what is indicated by the node of the density distribution @xmath190 at the point about @xmath199 .",
    "note , that during collision at @xmath200 the main part of the wave - packet is temporarily in the ground state , decays thereafter rapidly into the continuum but part of it goes into the excited molecular state .",
    "in contrast to this the case @xmath201 in fig.1b ( the case of the center - of - mass separation ) shows an almost complete decay the molecular ground state into the continuum : the remaining minor part of the probability density distribution near @xmath198 representing the molecular part is much smaller compared to the case @xmath202 .",
    "it was also shown that the molecular formation probabilities can be tuned by changing the trap frequencies @xmath195 and @xmath196 characterizing the transverse modes of the atomic species in the trap .",
    "+     +   +    the grid method for integration of the 2d multichannel scattering problem as a boundary - value problem ( section 2.4 ) was applied to extensively analyze the transverse excitations and deexcitations as well as resonant scattering processes at pair atomic collisions in harmonic waveguiedes @xcite .",
    "collisions of identical bosonic and fermionic as well as distinguishable atoms in harmonic traps with a single frequency @xmath100 permitting the center - of - mass separation were explored in depth . in the zero - energy limit and single mode regime the well - known cirs for bosonic @xcite , fermionic @xcite and heteronuclear @xcite collisions were reproduced . in case of the multi - mode regime up",

    "here the case @xmath211 illustrates the appearing of the cir in the scattering .",

    "it is very promising further development of these approaches in applications to hot problems of the few - body physics in confined geometry of optical traps .",
    "thus , the description of the effects of anisotropy and anharmonicity of the traps as well as strong anisotropy in the interparticle interactions ( scattering of polar molecules ) requires an extension to the increasing number of spatial variables .",
