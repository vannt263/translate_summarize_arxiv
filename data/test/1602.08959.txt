    "the semimetal bismuth is of interest both scientifically and technologically . indeed",
    ", it exhibits many fascinating properties , like giant magnetoresistance@xcite , thermoelectricity@xcite , large diamagnetism@xcite that can be ascribed to the peculiar electronic structure of bismuth , namely the small overlap between the valence and the conduction bands giving rise to a fermi surface made of tiny electron and hole pockets@xcite .",
    "real - world applications of bismuth related to the aforementioned properties range from hall magnetometry@xcite to diamagnetic levitation on the microscale@xcite .",
    "the possibility to drive bismuth strongly out of equilibrium by an ultrashort laser pulse is also behind a huge amount of experimental@xcite and theoretical work@xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the ultrafast dynamics of coherent optical phonons has been tackled by means of first - principles calculations where the lattice parameters are kept constant . however ,",
    "the development of strain from coherent acoustic phonons on a picosecond timescale is still poorly understood@xcite and has never been addressed by ab - initio calculations . a prerequisite for achieving such a goal is to demonstrate that the thermal expansion of bismuth at equilibrium can be understood and predicted by performing ab - initio calculations .",
    "a good strategy is to resort to the quasiharmonic approximation , where the atoms of the crystal are considered to undergo harmonic oscillations , but with frequencies that depend on strain .",
    "this approximation , when combined with density functional perturbation theory@xcite , has been found to produce thermal expansion coefficients in good agreement with experimental results well below the melting temperature of isotropic@xcite and anisotropic solids@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ details ] , we give an account of the technicalities used to perform our first - principles calculations . in section [ structure ] , we describe the crystallographic structure of bismuth and compare our calculated lattice constants with and without spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) to the experimental lattice constants at 4 k obtained from x - ray measurements . in section [ elastic_properties ] , we explain how the elastic constants at 0 k can be computed using a finite strain method and make a comparison with available experimental results indirectly obtained by measuring the sound wave velocities for different directions and polarizations .",
    "we also discuss the impact of soi on the calculated elastic constants . in section [ expansion ] , we introduce the theory allowing the calculation of the thermal expansion tensor of bismuth within the quasiharmonic approximation and compare the thermal expansion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the trigonal axis to some measurements made using an optical lever dilatometer .",
    "we also unravel the role respectively played by the elasticity and the anharmonicity in the anisotropy of the thermal expansion coefficients of bismuth .",
    "finally , the specific heat at constant pressure is reported and compared with calorimetry measurements .",
    "all the calculations are performed using the abinit code@xcite .",
    "we use a plane - wave basis set , the hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter ( hgh ) pseudopotentials@xcite and the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we carefully check the convergence of our results with respect to the wave function cut - off and the @xmath0-point sampling of the brillouin zone . a 40 ry cut - off and a @xmath1 mesh for brillouin zone sampling",
    "ensure that our results ( lattice parameters , elastic constants , phonon frequencies ) are well converged .",
    "the dynamical matrix is explicitly calculated on a @xmath2 @xmath3-point mesh using density functional perturbation theory@xcite and the phonon frequencies are fourier interpolated on a @xmath4 @xmath3-point mesh in order to compute the thermal expansion tensor .",
    "we include soi in all calculations but also present the lattice parameters and elastic constants obtained without soi in order to highlight the crucial role played by soi .",
    ".calculated lda lattice parameters with and without soi compared to the experimental results of ref@xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the computed values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 with and without soi are reported in table [ compressibility_tab ] .",
    "the compressibilities are underestimated with respect to experiments when soi is neglected .",
    "taking into account soi leads to a very good agreement between the theoretical and experimental compressibilities in accordance with the fact that the elastic constants that play a role in the compressibilities are much better described when soi is included ( see table [ elasticity_tab ] ) .",
    "the ratio of linear compressibilities @xmath7 calculated when soi is included indicates that the contraction along the trigonal axis is about 2.7 times larger than the contraction perpendicular to it upon applying an hydrostatic pressure . as stated before and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ energy_vs_strain ] , bi is stiffer perpendicularly to the trigonal axis than parallel to it .",
    "the bulk modulus @xmath8 that measures material s resistance to uniform compression is defined as @xmath9 where the hydrostatic compressibility @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 . using the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 reported in table [ compressibility_tab ] , we obtain a theoretical value of 33.65 ( 39.15 ) gpa for the bulk modulus @xmath8 when the soi is included ( neglected ) .",
    "thus , the theoretical value including the soi agrees well with the experimental value of 34.23 gpa at 4 k@xcite .",
    "all the forthcoming calculations include soi .",
    "we now present an analysis of the thermal expansion of bismuth using grneisen s theory .",
    "we follow the approach of schelling and keblinski@xcite and emphasize the differences in the formalism used to treat the thermal expansion in anisotropic and cubic solids . since bismuth is an anisotropic solid , the thermal expansion can be described in terms of the @xmath12 thermal expansion tensor @xmath13 whose components are written in terms of the strain tensor @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature and where the subscript @xmath17 means that the temperature derivative is taken at constant stress . according to the generalized form of hookes law , we have : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the stress and the compliance elastic tensor respectively .",
