    "it was einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) @xcite and afterwards bell @xcite who shed light on the non - local properties between subsystems in quantum mechanics .",
    "bell inequalities @xcite are constraints imposed by local hidden - variable theories ( lhvts ) on the values of some specific linear combinations of the averages of the results of spacelike separated experiments on distant systems . reported experimental violations of bell inequalities , e.g. , with photons @xcite or atoms @xcite , suggest that quantum mechanics ( qm ) can not be reproduced by lhvts .    in single particle systems where different degrees of freedom ( dofs ) are entangled , bell - like inequalities can be tested . in this scenario ,",
    "the conflict arises not between qm and lhvts but a violation confirms the impossibility of noncontextual hidden variable theories ( nchvts ) @xcite .",
    "experimental violations of bell - like inequalities can be found for single neutrons @xcite ( entanglement between spin and path dof ) and for single photons @xcite ( entanglement between polarization and path dof ) confirming quantum contextuality .",
    "kochen and specker @xcite were the first to analyse the concept of contextuality in qm which is a more general concept than non - locality , and leads to striking phenomena predicted by quantum theory .",
    "the conflict between lhvts and qm is even more apparent in tri- or multipartite quantum systems which was analysed by greenberger , horne and zeilinger ( ghz ) @xcite . here",
    "the contradiction leads to nonstatistical predictions in contrast to common bell - inequalities .",
    "mermin @xcite showed that this conflict can be converted into a larger violation of a bell - like inequality between three or more separated systems .",
    "experimental tests of these inequalities were reported , e.g. , for three and four photons @xcite as well as four ions @xcite .",
    "apart from technical challenges of preparing a ghz - like entangled state for single neutrons , the violation of a mermin - like inequality is interesting in itself because it is more robust to noise or disturbances than previous reported violations of bell - like inequalities @xcite which emphasizes the conflict between qm and nchvts .    here",
    ", we describe the experimental realization of tripartite entanglement for single neutrons @xcite where one external degree of freedom ( path states in the interferometer ) is entangled with two internal degrees of freedom ( spin and energy ) leading to a violation of a mermin - like inequality @xcite .",
    "the ghz state was first proposed for four spin-@xmath1 particles by greenberger , horne and zeilinger @xcite .",
    "later on mermin @xcite presented a version with three spin-@xmath1 particles ; in ref .",
    "@xcite he pointed out how ghz - states can be used to reveal the relation between kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite and bells theorem @xcite .",
    "suppose three spin-@xmath1 particles emitted from a common source in the so called ghz - state,@xmath2 fly apart in different directions .",
    "measurements on the three particles are described by pauli - spin operators with measurement outcomes @xmath3 . consider the following three hermitian , commuting operators @xmath4 which satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath5 for a system prepared in state @xmath6 we can measure , for example , the x - component of particle @xmath7 and the y - component of particle @xmath8 and infer the result of the y - measurement of particle @xmath9 by the fact that the product of all three measurements is @xmath10 .",
    "the same reasoning holds for the other operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meas.op ] ) .",
    "thus we may conclude that the system is characterized by predefined number , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with values @xmath17 , representing the measurement outcomes .",
    "the conflict arises if we measure the operator @xmath18 which commutes with all @xmath19 and satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath20 the measurement outcomes have to obey the relations @xmath21 which turns out to be impossible . by multiplication of the left hand sides of ( [ eq : relations ] ) as well as the right hand sides we get @xmath10 for the left hand sides because all outcomes appear twice whereas the right hand side gives @xmath22 .",
    "the argument leads to a contradiction because the perfect correlations of qm ( perfect predictability of measurement outcomes ) are incompatible with the premisses of lhvt ( locality and reality ) .",
    "the above reasoning also can be cast into a ks form which is independent of specific states ( details may be found in ref .",
    "in a radio - frequency ( rf ) oscillating magnetic field the incoming neutron changes the spin direction as well as the total energy .",
    "the scheme of coherent energy - manipulation @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a polarized neutron enters an area of a spatially - distributed guide magnetic field , @xmath23 , which induces a shift of potential - energy , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 correspond to parallel and anti - parallel spin - states and @xmath26 is the neutron magnetic moment ) due to the zeeman effect .",
    "this is accompanied by a change of kinetic energy accordingly : the total energy , given by the sum of kinetic and potential energies , is conserved .",
    "then , the spin is flipped by an additional oscillating magnetic field @xmath27 in a constant guide field @xmath23 , which , in turn , leads to a coherent ( total ) energy manipulation .",
    "in contrast to the time - independent spatial interaction of @xmath28 , a time - dependent interaction induces changes in the potential energy and the kinetic energy is kept constant .",
    "it is worth noting here that , although the spin flip occurs in manipulating the total energy , the spin itself can be flipped , or rather arbitrarily manipulated , independently with the use of stationary magnetic field , e.g. , by a dc - coil .",
    "this fact implies that a spin - flip by a rf - flipper accompanied by another spin - flip by a dc - flipper afterwards or beforehand effectively works as a ( total ) energy manipulation without altering the spin : the spin , and energy degrees of freedoms ( dofs ) in our experiments are independently manipulable .",

    "a rf spin - flipper is inserted in the path ii , where the spin - flip process by a time - dependent interaction induces energy transitions from the initial energy state @xmath31 to states @xmath32 by photon exchange @xcite .",
    "consequently , one can generate neutrons in a triply entangled ghz - like state , given by @xmath33        the state of neutrons is characterized by three ( the spin , path and energy ) dofs : all of them are described simply by two - level quantum systems .",
    "measurement operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 in each dof are accomplished by phase manipulations between superpositions of the basis states in each dof .",

    "mermin @xcite analyzed the ghz argument in detail and derived an inequality suitable for experimental tests to distinguish between predictions of qm and lhvts since perfect correlations can not be observed in real experiments ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a similar way , assuming a tripartite system and taking the assumption in the conditionally independent form due to nchvts instead of lhvts , the border for a sum of expectation values of certain product observables is obtained .",

    "nchvts demands @xmath46 , while quantum theory predicts an upper bound of 4 : any measured value of @xmath40 that is larger than 2 decides in favor of quantum contextuality .",

    "the deviation from the ideal value of 4 is solely due to the reduced contrast ( just below @xmath56 ) of the interferograms .",
    "tripartite entanglement for single particles is investigated : in particular , coherent and individual manipulations of the neutron s spin , path and energy dofs are achived .",
    "a ghz - like state is implemented and used to confirm the fact that a mermin - like inequality is violated .",
    "this experiment clearly shows that the total energy dof is an appropriate two - level subsystem to be entangled with other dofs .",
    "it is worth noting here that , while the total - energy subsystem is treated here as a discrete two - level quantum system , the discreteness is not of natural origin but artificially created : our experiment shows the possibility of introducing artificial discrete _ quantum _ levels in a per se continuously distributed space .",
    "this fact can provide flexible resources for quantum information and communication applications ; for instance , multi energy - levels in a single - particle system , created by sequential energy manipulation schemes with multiple frequencies , can be exploited .",
    "furthermore , the concept of entanglement between different dofs for single neutrons can be extended , e.g. , by using the k - vector ( kinetic energy ) as dof which can be manipulated independently of the path , spin and the total energy by tuning an ( external ) magnetic field .",
