    "according to goldstone s theorem , this pattern of symmetry breaking gives rise to five massless bosons , the so - called nambu - goldstone bosons , corresponding to the five broken generators of @xmath0 .",

    "the appearance of a longitudinal degree of freedom is commonly a sign that the gauge boson becomes massive .    in a dense ( or hot ) medium ,",
    "however , even _ without _ spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry the gauge bosons already have a longitudinal degree of freedom , the so - called _ plasmon _ mode @xcite .",

    "it is _ a priori _ unclear how the nambu - goldstone bosons interact with these longitudinal gluon modes . in particular , it is of interest to know whether coupling terms between these modes exist and , if yes , whether these terms can be eliminated by a suitable choice of ( t  hooft ) gauge .",
    "the aim of the present work is to address these questions .",
    "we shall show that the answer to both questions is `` yes '' .",

    "fig .  5 ( a ) of ref .",
    "it was already realized in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reason for this unphysical behavior is the fact that the mixing of the gluon with the excitations of the condensate was neglected .",
    "it was moreover suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that proper inclusion of this mixing would amend the shortcomings of the previous analysis .",

    "we derive the transverse and longitudinal gluon propagators including fluctuations of the diquark condensate . in section [ iii ]",

    "let us mention that one could again have introduced different fields @xmath91 for each replica @xmath52 , but this is not really necessary , as we shall take the limit @xmath49 at the end of the calculation anyway .",

    "<S> this leads to a vanishing gluon spectral density for energies and momenta located on the dispersion branch of the nambu - goldstone excitations . </S>"
