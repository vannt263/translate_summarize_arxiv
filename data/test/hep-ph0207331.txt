    "in standard inflationary scenarios of the early universe , the transition from the inflationary regime itself to the radiation dominated phase ( or standard big bang regime ) is accomplished through a short period of reheating after inflation , when the inflaton field , by rapidly oscillating at the bottom of its potential in a time scale shorter than the hubble time , releases all of its energy in the form of light particles that it may be coupled to .",
    "recent studies on this reheating phase have shown the possibility of emergence of new and interesting phenomena , like explosive particle production , nonequilibrium symmetry restoration , among others effects @xcite .",
    "these effects are directly related to the possibility of the oscillating inflaton field to drive the fluctuations of the coupled fields to regimes of parametric amplification , or parametric resonance , where particles are efficiently produced .    the parametric resonance , or preheating phase ,",
    "has then been shown to be a fundamental effect that must take place before the actual reheating of the universe through the thermalization of the produced particles @xcite .",
    "preheating also can be easily obtained in very different models by means of a linear or a quadratic coupling between the inflaton and the radiation fields . in all those cases",
    "the inflaton , oscillating at the bottom of its potential ( after the inflationary phase ) , behaves as a periodic mass for the other scalar fields that are coupled to it . as a consequence , the equations for the modes @xmath0 of the fluctuation fields present exponential solutions    @xmath1\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 , the floquet exponent , may be either real or complex , depending on the parameters adopted",
    "one is thus able to define the so called instability bands in the parameter space , within which the floquet exponent is real , indicating exponentially ( de)increasing solutions .",
    "the regions of the parameter space where @xmath2 is imaginary , on the other hand , correspond to oscillatory solutions and are thus called stability bands .",
    "one important aspect concerning the band structure and exponential growth of fluctuations is the possible chaotic behavior associated to the very existence of the bands , both at their borders and inside them .",
    "our concern in this paper is thus to determine the dimension of the borders between two such bands .",
    "we will also be interested in calculating the dimension of the border between two different values of the floquet exponent inside a given instability band .",
    "as we will show , all of them are fractal , unambiguously characterizing them as chaotic ones . as such",
    ", they prevent one from telling if a given mode , assumed close enough to a border , will be amplified or not .",
    "thus , the outcome of the preheating phase will strongly depend on the state of the universe right after the inflationary period .",
    "the fractality , or chaoticity , of the borders separating instability bands is , in a sense , not a completely unexpected result .",
    "for example , in a recent work @xcite the authors argued for the close relation between the presence of chaos and parametric resonance .",
    "in fact , the equation of motion for the fluctuation fields coupled to the inflaton field , viewed as a classical equation of motion , resembles that of an harmonic oscillator driven by a periodic external force , which is well known to exhibit chaotic behavior under appropriate conditions .",
    "a few other papers have also studied chaos in the context of preheating , as by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , although they have studied chaos _",
    "after _ the preheating period . in general , the dynamics of interacting fields may show the possibility of chaotic dynamics , as has been shown recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one important aspect associated to the microscopic physics of interacting fields raised in refs .",
    "@xcite was the importance of dissipation in the dynamics of coupled system of fields and the influence of dissipation on the degree of chaoticity of the field dynamics .",
    "recall that typically the effect of dissipation is to damp the fluctuations on the system and consequently tends to suppress possible chaotic motions and makes field trajectories in phase space to tend faster to the system asymptotic states .",
    "this is indeed the case for the dynamics of background ( or classical ) field configurations .",
    "however , the fluctuation ( or quantum ) modes of the fields that experience parametric resonance are not only subject to dissipation but also to stochastic noise , being both related by a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite .",
    "previous works have also studied the influence of noise during preheating .",
    "for example the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have studied the consequences to preheating when a somewhat _ ad hoc _ noise is added as a mass term to the secondary field s equation of motion . here",
    ", in contrast , we will take the equation for the inflaton as a typical ensemble averaged equation of motion ( as we should expect for a background field configuration ) and noise is only included in the effective equation of motion for the fluctuation field coupled to the inflaton .",
    "this equation is self - consistently derived for both dissipation and noise through the usual method of schwinger s closed time path formalism of real time ( for previous references , see for instance refs .",
    "the simultaneous effect of noise and dissipation for the reheating have been also considered recently by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite where they also derived self - consistently the effective equations of motions for both the inflaton and the radiation fields .",
    "their main interest was , however , in the final stages of reheating , not including therefore the consequences of both noise and dissipation for the preheating phase .",
    "this is our main concern in this paper , which we will specialize in the simultaneous effect of noise and dissipation on the fractality of the borders of the instability bands and how these microscopic physics associated to the dynamics of the fields may alter the parametric resonance phenomenon during preheating .",
    "the chaotic behavior associated to the parametric resonance stage is then studied by means of the determination of the fractal dimensions of the borders of the instability bands . as argued before in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the fractal dimension gives a topological measure of chaos for different space - time settings and it is a quantity invariant under coordinate transformations , yielding then an unambiguous signal for chaos in cosmology and general relativity problems in general .",
    "the dimension of the border provides thus a robust characterization for chaos as opposed to lyapunov exponents which may change sign by a simple change of observer @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we consider a simple model leading to preheating consisting of an inflaton field @xmath3 of chaotic inflation with quadratic potential coupled to a set of radiation scalar fields @xmath4 that @xmath3 can decay to .",
    "additionally we allow the radiation fields to decay to fermion fields @xmath5 ( in this model the final radiation energy density is composed of fermion matter fields ) .",
    "the effective equations of motion for both the inflaton @xmath3 field and the radiation @xmath4 fields are then explicitly derived . in sec .",
    "iii we present our numerical studies concerning the parametric resonance in our model and the computation of the fractal dimension of the border of the instability bands . finally in sec .",
    "iv we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we will study here the simplest model of an inflaton field @xmath3 coupled to a set of scalar fields @xmath4 , @xmath6 , through a trilinear coupling .",
    "although quadratic couplings between the fields are more common in the study of resonance during preheating , models with trilinear couplings exhibit the same phenomenon as well and had been used before as a toy model in different analysis @xcite .",
    "we choose this simplest model here for convenience since it will allow a more straightforward analysis of the problem without having to compute higher order terms , as we are going to see below .",
    "additionally , we couple to the radiation scalar fields @xmath4 a set of fermion fields @xmath5 , @xmath7 , thus allowing @xmath4 to decay into the fermion fields .",
    "these kind of models as this one we will study here , allowing cascade decay sequences as @xmath8 and @xmath9 have shown to exhibit interesting dissipation properties @xcite and would then be particularly interesting to study them in the context of reheating and parametric resonance after inflation . the model we study here is then described by the following lagrangian density    @xmath10 + \\sum_{k=1}^{n_{\\psi } } \\bar{\\psi}_{k } \\left[i \\not\\!\\partial - m_{\\psi_k } - \\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\chi } h_{kj } \\chi_j \\right ] \\psi_{k } \\;. \\label{model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we can easily obtain the exact equation of motion for the inflaton field from the model eq .",

    "each energy cutoff defines the border between two different ranges for the floquet exponent .",
    "we next move to the determination of the fractal dimension .",
    "the fractal dimension is associated with the possible different exit modes under small changes of the initial conditions at @xmath102 and it will give a measure of the degree of chaos of our dynamical system .",
    "the exit modes we refer to above are the ones associated to trajectories that evolve to the stable band or to the unstable one , as determined by the given cutoff energy @xmath103 .",
    "the method we employ to determine the fractal dimension is the box - counting method , which is a standard method for determining the fractal dimension of boundaries @xcite .",
    "its definition and the specific numerical implementation we use here have been described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic procedure is : given a set of initial conditions @xmath104 at @xmath105 that leads to a certain outcome for the trajectory in phase space , we study whether there will be a change of outcome for the trajectory due to a perturbation @xmath106 ( i.e. , whether the perturbation will lead to a different attractor or not ) . given a volume region in phase space around a boundary between different attractors and perturbing a large set of initial conditions inside that region , the fraction of uncertain trajectories , @xmath107 , that result in a different outcome under a small perturbation can be shown to scale with the perturbation @xmath106 as @xcite @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is called the uncertainty exponent .",
    "the box - counting dimension of the boundary in phase space separating different attractors , or fractal dimension @xmath110 , is given by  @xcite @xmath111 , where @xmath112 denotes the dimension of the phase space .",
    "for our system of equations of motion , @xmath113 . for a fractal boundary @xmath114 , implying that @xmath115 , whereas for a non - fractal boundary , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .    following the method of box - counting for this problem , it is enough to consider variations only on the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the wave - number squared and coupling constant squared , respectively .",
    "perturbations around these variables are taken between @xmath120 to @xmath121 , as we move from the first to the third band in fig . 1 and where the initial conditions are determined .",
    "for each region separating the instability bands , set by the variations of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we then consider a large number of random points ( a total of @xmath122 random points for each run was used ) enough to produce a reliable statistics with errors around the percent ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a description of estimates of the statistical error ) .",
    "all initial conditions are then numerically evolved by using an eighth - order runge - kutta integration method and the fractal dimension is obtained by statistically studying the outcome of each initial condition for each run of the large set of points .",
    "the fractal dimension of each of the borders shown in fig .",
    "1 is given in table i. note that they all differ only within the statistical error in the determination of the fractal dimension .",
    "we have verified that this result also applies to other different regions of parameter space , showing that this is not a coincidence for the instability bands shown .",
    "this is an important result since for every parameter region chosen , they will all have similar dynamical properties with each instability band then sharing similar properties . in this case , the dynamics is much less affected by the parameter space but only model dependent . in special",
    ", the fractality of those borders shows that one can not be certain about the precise value of the floquet exponent for a given mode , even though it is well inside an instability band .",
    "the numerical results are shown in table [ bands ] , for the first three bands and for three different energy cutoff values .",
    "the results shown were produced considering @xmath123 in eqs .",
    "( [ final eom ] ) and ( [ final eomchi ] ) .",
    "we next study the influence of the number of field modes coupled to the inflaton field @xmath124 , by changing the number of fermion fields @xmath125 and the boson fields ones @xmath126 . as it can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ etaphi ] ) and ( [ etachi ] ) this will , consequently , lead to changes to the dissipation coefficients . as we increase the decaying modes to both @xmath124 and @xmath4 fields we expect the larger be the dissipation terms .",
    "the damping of the oscillations of the background field will eventually lead to a destruction of the instability bands . at the same time , even for underdamping oscillations we expect that as we increase the decaying modes the smoother will get the borders between stable and unstable regions of parameter space , leading to a continuous decrease of the fractal dimension associated to the borders of the bands .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical studies and the results for the change in fractal dimension as we increase the number of fields is shown in fig .",
    "[ ndf ] , where we have restricted ourselves to the first instability band shown in fig .",
    "1 , for an energy threshold of @xmath127 , and considered for simplicity @xmath128 .",
    "similar results would also follow to the other bands but are not shown here .",
    "our results indicate that the fractal dimension of the borders ( within the statistical error ) does not change in any significant way for each instability band .",
    "it also shows very little dependence on the energy threshold chosen .",
    "these results , besides indicating that the border between the regions ( defined by their own floquet exponents ) inside a given band is itself fractal and thus exhibits chaotic dynamics , shows that the dynamical properties of each instability band is independent of the precise region taken in the parameter space , and it is only model dependent .",
    "the fractal structure is also present if we fix the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath26 and vary only the initial inflaton conditions ( @xmath11 and @xmath129 ) .",
    "this shows a strong dependence of the outcome on the initial conditions , with major implications in the early universe models .",
    "for instance , an initial phase of warm inflation @xcite , even if it is not able to generate enough radiation to match the standard big bang model , may turn out to be crucial for generating the adequate initial conditions for the preheating phase .",
    "one may notice from eq .",
    "( [ eomchik ] ) that the effective mass squared @xmath130 for the field @xmath131 may become negative , triggering its decay via the so - called tachyonic instability ( also known as spinodal decomposition ) .",
    "we have restricted the initial value of the inflaton @xmath3 so that it does not happen in our simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of such a decay with parametric amplification is an interesting and complex subject on its own and it will be addressed in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
