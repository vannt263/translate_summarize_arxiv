    "natural ferritin is the iron - storage protein of animals , plants and bacteria .",
    "it is composed of a ferrihydrite - like core with formula ( feooh)@xmath3(feoh@xmath4po@xmath5 ) about 7 nm in diameter and containing up to about 4500 fe atoms @xcite , surrounded by a 12 nm diameter multisubunit protein shell . by a suitable chemical synthesis process",
    ", it is possible to reconstitute the ferrihydrite ferritin core inside the empty protein shell ( in this case obtained from horse spleen ferritin by reductive dissolution of the native core ) @xcite .",
    "this way , one can monitor the amount of iron available for the build up of the core , and a better control of the average core size is obtained .",
    "a number of investigations have been performed , both on natural and artificial ferritin , using either @xmath0fe mssbauer absorption spectroscopy @xcite or magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the magnetic structure of the fe@xmath6 ions in the core is probably antiferromagnetic , and that the particles possess a ( small ) uncompensated magnetic moment . however , the interpretation of the data obtained by the two techniques is somewhat contradictory .",
    "indeed , on one side , the mssbauer studies with applied magnetic field @xcite reveal that , for randomly oriented ferritin samples , the fe@xmath6 magnetic moments in the cores remain close to their easy axes , even in a strong field of 14 t . on the other side ,",
    "the magnetic measurements have been interpreted so far by assuming that the uncompensated magnetization follows a langevin law , which implicitly assumes the fe@xmath6 moments are free to rotate . besides its fundamental interest",
    ", the understanding of the magnetic properties of ferritin is of importance for nmr relaxometry @xcite and biophysical purposes as it is a good contrasting agent for nmr imaging .",
    "the ferritin core has also recently arisen great interest because it has been thought to be a good candidate for the observation of quantum tunneling of the magnetization @xcite , and various experimental studies , at low temperature , have claimed to have observed this tunneling @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to reexamine the problem of the uncompensated magnetization in ferritin , by comparing @xmath0fe mssbauer data , both in zero field and in applied fields up to 7 t , with magnetization data obtained for the same samples .",
    "we show that , by taking proper account of the crystalline anisotropy in an antiferromagnetic structure , one obtains a coherent interpretation of the results of the two techniques .",
    "we present a new interpretation of the superparamagnetic behaviour of an ensemble of randomly oriented antiferromagnetic particles , in terms of a non - langevin law for the uncompensated magnetisation , for applied magnetic fields lower than the spin - flop field .",
    "this approach , which was evoked by nel in an early work @xcite , has however never been considered in the modern and quantitative magnetic investigations of ferritin .",
    "another motivation of our work is to examine the influence of the mean iron content of the ( artificial ) ferritin core ( ranging from 400 to 2500 fe atoms ) on the physical properties , such as the anisotropy energy , or the nel temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ echant ] contains the description of the artificial ferritin samples , section [ superpara ] briefly recalls the superparamagnetic behaviour of antiferromagnetic particles , both from the point of view of magnetometry and @xmath0fe mssbauer spectroscopy , sections [ zfc ] and [ moss ] contain respectively the fc - zfc magnetic susceptibility and zero field mssbauer measurements , and the high field mssbauer data ; in section [ exchange ] , the influence of anisotropy in uncompensated antiferromagnets is examined , and section [ aimantation ] reports the magnetisation experiments and the new interpretation we propose .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of decreasing both the particle size and the mean number of fe atoms per ferritin core , the experiments were performed with a set of artificial ferritin samples with different fe loadings .",
    "five samples were studied , having an average iron loading ranging from 400 to 2500 fe ions per ferritin core . in order to obtain a good signal to noise ratio in the mssbauer spectra ,",
    "the mohr salt used as the starting material was prepared with iron 95% enriched in @xmath0fe .",
    "the protein concentration was determined by the lowry method and the mean iron content by atomic adsorption analysis . in the following",
    ", the samples will be labelled according to the mean number of fe atoms per core determined by this latter method .",
    "the samples consist of a solution of artificial ferritin with a concentration of about 10mg / ml , that is ten times smaller than the concentration of commercial ferritin ( about 100mg / ml ) .",
    "then , the distance between particles in the solution is about 50 nm , which corresponds to a dipolar field of magnitude 10 mg ( at saturation of the uncompensated moments ) .",
    "our samples can therefore be considered as an ensemble of non - interacting particles .",
    "pictures taken by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) show the cores to be discrete and roughly spherical in shape .",
    "size histograms have been established by measuring the diameter of 500 particles taken from different parts of the grid .",
    "for each sample , the diameter distribution is rather narrow and can be fitted to a lognormal shape , with a mean diameter d@xmath7 ranging from 4 nm for the particles with 400 fe atoms per core to 5.7 nm for the particles with 2571 fe atoms per core , and a standard diameter deviation @xmath8 about 0.15 .",
    "electron diffraction patterns , performed on the particles with 2571 fe atoms per core , give d - spacings corresponding to well - ordered ferrihydrite .",
    "the magnetisation measurements were made with a commercial squid magnetometer in magnetic fields up to 5.5 t in the temperature range 2.5k-250k .",
    "for all temperatures and fields , we have measured both the signal of the solution containing ferritin and the signal of the solution containing apoferritin ( the empty protein shells ) with the same concentration .",
    "after subtraction of the second signal from the first , we thus obtain the signal due only to the ferritin cores . for the low field ( 80 g ) magnetisation measurements , both field cooled ( fc ) and zero field cooled ( zfc ) branches were measured .",
    "in the zero field cooled ( zfc ) procedure , the sample was cooled in zero field from room temperature down to 2.5k , and for the field cooled ( fc ) branch , the sample was cooled with a field of 80 g from room temperature to 2.5k ; in both cases , measurements proceeded on heating .",
    "the @xmath0fe mssbauer absorption spectroscopy experiments were performed both in zero magnetic field and in magnetic fields up to 7 t applied perpendicular to the @xmath9-ray propagation direction , between 4.2k and 90k .",
    "the mssbauer spectra were obtained using a @xmath0co : rh source , mounted on an electromagnetic drive with a triangular velocity signal .",
    "the ferritin solution was placed in a copper holder covered with pure thin aluminium sheets , ensuring a good thermalization . for the in - field measurements ,",
    "the ferritin solution is first frozen in zero field and therefore there is no preferential orientation of the magnetization of the particles .",
    "the fe@xmath6 ion has a saturated magnetic moment @xmath10 = 5@xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic structure of the ferritin cores is expected to be antiferromagnetic , with a nel temperature @xmath12 of the order of a few hundred kelvins . in zero external field ,",
    "the preferential orientation of the two antiferromagnetic sublattices in the core is determined by the crystalline anisotropy ( `` antiferromagnetic axis '' ) . for antiferromagnetic nanometric particles ,",
    "one expects a small uncompensated magnetization which may arise from the core ( presence of defects ) and/or from the unpaired surface moments of the particle @xcite . due to the strong exchange interaction ,",

    "the characteristic time can be considered to be the measurement time @xmath29 , which is about 100s . in low fields , and for the superparamagnetic regime , nel has shown that the magnetization is the sum of two contributions @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the susceptibility arising from the canting of the two antiferromagnetic sublattices , and @xmath32 is the magnetization due to the uncompensated moments . at t=0 and in the case",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the antiferromagnetic axis , @xmath33 which , in the standard molecular field theory , is given by : @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the magnetization of a sublattice and @xmath36 the exchange field . in the low field limit , the uncompensated magnetization follows a curie law , irrespective of the strengh of the anisotropy @xcite . at higher fields ,",
    "the choice of an expression for @xmath37 is not a trivial problem , and an important issue of the present work is the determination of the best approximation for the field and temperature dependence of the uncompensated magnetization in antiferromagnetic particles .",
    "the characteristic mssbauer time is the larmor period @xmath38 associated with the magnetic hyperfine interaction . for @xmath0fe , it is of the order of 5@xmath3910@xmath40s . in the case of magnetic ordering of the fe@xmath6 ions , there is a magnetic hyperfine field @xmath41 at the nucleus , proportional to the fe@xmath6 moment and directed opposite to it . if the fluctuation time @xmath42 of the magnetization ( and hence of the hyperfine field ) is longer than @xmath38 , the mssbauer spectrum is a six- line hyperfine field pattern ; if it is smaller than @xmath38 , the mssbauer spectrum is a two - line quadrupolar pattern . in real systems , due to the broad distribution of @xmath42 values , a zero field pattern consists of a superposition of magnetic and quadrupolar subspectra , in a sizeable temperature range .",

    "the two fc and zfc branches of the magnetic susceptibility for the particles with 410 fe atoms per core , measured in a field @xmath49=80 g , are represented in fig.[fc410 ] .",
    "the signal is almost entirely due to the uncompensated moments , the antiferromagnetic susceptibility being very weak as will be shown in section [ aimantation ] .",

    "the peak temperature of the zfc curve for the particles with 410 fe atoms per core is @xmath507.5k , and the irreversibility temperature at which the fc and zfc branches join is @xmath51 15k . to interpret these curves ,",
    "we follow here the model of ref .. assuming that , for a given particle volume , the uncompensated moment @xmath52 is a known function of @xmath15 , the thermal variation of the fc and zfc magnetic moment writes : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the log - normal volume distribution function , @xmath55 the blocking volume associated with @xmath29 , and with @xmath56s , and @xmath57=0 for the zfc branch and @xmath58 for the fc branch .",
    "however , in antiferromagnetic particles , the relationship between volume and uncompensated moment is not well known .",

    "the mean value of this distribution is proportional to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of fe atoms in the particle and p=1/2 , 1/3 or 2/3 in the case respectively of a random distribution of the uncompensated moments in the volume , at the surface , or in the presence of regular `` active '' ( ferromagnetic ) planes at the surface .",
    "it appears that the fit of the experimental fc and zfc curves using eqn.[mzfc ] is not very sensitive to the particular shape of the distribution of uncompensated moments , nor to the choice of a particular @xmath61 value .",
    "the solid lines in fig.[fc410 ] , which reproduce quite well the experimental data , were obtained by introducing a gaussian distribution of @xmath52 values into expression ( [ mzfc ] ) .",

    "the fitted value of the proportionality parameter @xmath66 is in the range 0.81 for the different particle sets , and the standard deviation of the diameter distribution was kept at the value @xmath8=0.15 obtained from the size histograms .",
    "this choice of a @xmath67 law for the mean @xmath52 value corresponds to a volumic random distribution of the fe atoms bearing the uncompensated moments but , as emphasized before , the data do not allow us to exclude the presence of uncompensated moments at the surface .",
    "nevertheless , these fits allow the anisotropy constant @xmath17 to be determined : we find that @xmath17 lies in the range 36 10@xmath1ergs/@xmath2 for the different particle sets , with a tendency to increase as the particle size decreases .    in fig.[courbezfc ]",
    "is represented , for each sample , the behaviour of the zfc magnetization as a function of temperature ( the fit is shown as a solid line only for the particles with 2571 fe atoms per core ) .",
    "the peak temperature increases with the particle size , and it varies approximately linearly with the mean barrier energy @xmath68 , as can be seen in fig.[vartpic ] . as , in antiferromagnetic particles ,",
    "the shape anisotropy is very small @xcite , this linear correlation is expected if the volumic anisotropy dominates over the surface anisotropy .",

    ", the quadrupolar doublet progressively replaces the six - line magnetic pattern as the superparamagnetic fluctuation time of more and more particles becomes smaller than @xmath38 , i.e. as the blocking volume given by eqn.([vb ] ) associated with the characteristic time @xmath38 becomes smaller .",
    "the spectra were fitted to a superposition of a quadrupolar hyperfine spectrum and of magnetic hyperfine spectra with a distribution of hyperfine fields ( histogram ) .",
    "= 7 cm    the thermal variation of the relative intensity @xmath75 of the quadrupolar doublet derived from these fits is shown in fig.[pourc ] .",
    "this `` paramagnetic fraction '' can be calculated in the frame of nel s model of thermally activated fluctuations : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath56s .",
    "the paramagnetic fraction is independent of the values ( or distribution ) of the uncompensated moments as long as one neglects the possible ( but unknown in antiferromagnets ) dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath52 . for all particle sets , the thermal variation of @xmath78",
    "is well reproduced using eqn.[parfract ] ( solid line in fig.[pourc ] ) , with an anisotropy constant close to that derived from the fit of the fc - zfc susceptibility curves .",
    "the blocking temperature , defined as the temperature for which half of the particles are in the superparamagnetic regime , increases with the particle mean size . for all iron loadings ,",
    "all the particles are in the superparamagnetic regime above 80 - 100k .",
    "according to the zero field mssbauer data , for all particle sizes , the fluctuations of the magnetization at 4.2k are slow with respect to the hyperfine larmor frequency , and they are fast at 90k . in - field",
    "mssbauer spectra at these temperatures have been recorded in natural ferritin and haemosiderin in ref .. we repeated these measurements in our artificial ferritin samples to try and detect the influence of the particle size on the orientation of the magnetic moments in the frozen and paramagnetic regimes when a magnetic field up to 7 t is applied .",
    "we actually found that there is no drastic qualitative change of the in - field spectra for the different particle sets , and our data are similar to those recorded in natural ferritin .",
    "we therefore only present the spectra for the particles with 410 fe atoms per core , and our interpretation follows the same lines as that made in ref ..      the spectra at 4.2k for fields of 3 t and 7 t in these particles are shown in fig.[moss4.2 ] .",
    "they are resolved six line hyperfine spectra , analogous to the zero - field spectrum ( see top of fig.[mosschmpnul ] ) .",
    "the intensity ratios of the pairs of lines remain close to 3:2:1 , even at 7 t , which means that the field does not drastically modify the orientations of the individual fe@xmath6 moments with respect to those in the randomly oriented zero - field configuration .",
    "the spectra were then fitted assuming random orientations of the static hyperfine field @xmath45 , with fixed magnitude . for a given angle @xmath79 between @xmath45 and the applied field ,",
    "the magnitude of the effective field @xmath80 experienced by the nucleus is given by : @xmath81 the orientational disorder of @xmath82 yields then a small distribution of the magnitude of @xmath83 .",
    "it entirely accounts for the broadening of the lines with respect to the zero - field linewidths , which is the most visible at 7 t .",
    "= 7 cm    as seen in fig.[moss4.2 ] , the model of a random orientation of the moments satisfactorily reproduces the shape of the mssbauer spectra , except for a small misfit of the shape of the intermediate pair of lines .",
    "this implies that , up to a field of 7 t , the magnetic moments of the fe@xmath6 ions remain close to the antiferromagnetic axis in our ferritin samples at 4.2k .",
    "the same qualitative conclusion can be drawn from the 14 t spectrum in horse spleen ferritin of ref .. in the following , we will label this moment configuration as the `` random magnetic orientation '' configuration .      in the superparamagnetic regime and in zero",
    "applied field , the fast fluctuations of the hyperfine field smear out the magnetic hyperfine structure . at 90k ,",
    "the zero field spectrum is a quadrupolar doublet identical with the main component of the spectrum at 35k shown at the bottom of fig.[mosschmpnul ] .",
    "if a field is applied , the shape of the spectra , shown in fig.[moss90 ] , changes , and at 5 t a six line hyperfine field pattern is distinguishable , but with large broadenings . in order to interpret the spectra",
    ", we will assume that a dynamic `` random magnetic orientation '' model holds at 90k , i.e. that the moments fluctuate along or close to the antiferromagnetic axis .",
    "our analysis follows here that of ref .. for a given orientation @xmath79 of the antiferromagnetic axis and a given value of the uncompensated moment , the energies of the two particle states with `` up '' and `` down '' orientations.of the uncompensated moment are separated by a zeeman splitting : @xmath84 at a given fe site , the hyperfine fields associated with each energy level are opposite , resulting in a thermally averaged hyperfine field : @xmath85 , \\label{hhf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the local hyperfine field .",
    "the values of @xmath87 for a given particle set are therefore distributed due to both the distribution of @xmath88 values and to the random distribution in @xmath79 values .",
    "= 7 cm    the fits of the in - field spectra with this dynamic `` random magnetic orientation '' model , like those of the fc - zfc curves , are rather insensitive to both the assumption made about the distribution of uncompensated moment values and the value of the exponent @xmath61 . for the fits shown as solid lines in fig.[moss90 ] , we used the same distribution of uncompensated moments as for the fits of the fc - zfc curves , i.e. a truncated gaussian shape with a mean value : @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the parameter @xmath66 is 0.4 - 0.5 for the lowest fields , and that it decreases as the field increases .",
    "the good reproduction of the spectral shape , especially if one considers that @xmath66 is the only adjustable parameter , indicates that it is realistic to consider that the individual moments , and hence the sublattice magnetizations , fluctuate along or close to the antiferromagnetic axis at 90k .",
    "the fact that the mean uncompensated moment found here is about twice smaller than that derived from the fc - zfc curves probably originates from the roughness of the assumption of a gaussian distribution of @xmath52 values .",
    "the decrease of @xmath66 as the field increases , also observed in ref . , is probably due to the fact that the `` random magnetic orientation '' model starts to break down at the higher fields , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath66 at the lowest fields ( @xmath890.5 ) are similar to those derived from the magnetization measurements described in section [ aimantation ] .",
    "before proceeding with the experimental results of the magnetization measurements and their interpretation , we will examine the effect of a magnetic field on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic particle , and determine the field range for which the `` random magnetic orientation '' configuration is expected to be a correct approximation . for a fully compensated antiferromagnet , the relevant threshold field is the so - called spin - flop field which writes : @xmath90 , where @xmath36 is the exchange field and @xmath91 the anisotropy field , @xmath35 being the magnetization of one sublattice @xcite .",

    "thus the @xmath118 `` random magnetic orientation '' model is seen to be a good approximation for fields lower than the maximum field of our experiments ( 7 t ) , thus justifying the use of this approximation to account for the @xmath13=4.2k in - field mssbauer spectra . this model starts to break down for a field around 7 t and , above the spin - flop field , the equilibrium @xmath93 value is seen to be quasi independent of @xmath79 and growing towards 90@xmath98 as the field is further increased .    for a fully compensated antiferromagnetic particle , the energy profiles present two equally deep potential wells , separated by @xmath121 , corresponding to the invariance of the system by inversion of the two sublattice moments . when the particle possesses an uncompensated moment , this symmetry is broken and the energy profiles become asymmetrical , as shown in fig.[enerthnc ] which represents @xmath122 from eqn.[enernc ] for different applied fields up to 15 t , and for @xmath116=0.03 , @xmath36=320 t and @xmath123=0.18 t .",

    "is easily overcome by the zeeman energy and the langevin model is a good approximation , although deviations from it have been observed at low temperature and interpreted using a full boltzmann calculation of the magnetization ( see for instance ref . ) . in randomly oriented antiferromagnetic particles ,",
    "a calculation of the total magnetization along the same lines is much more difficult because it involves four variables , i.e. two positional angles for the each of the two sublattices .",
    "therefore , as a low field approximation , we interpret the contribution of the uncompensated moments in the superparamagnetic regime using the dynamic `` random magnetic orientations '' model , assuming that they fluctuate between two antiparallel directions along the antiferromagnetic axes .",
    "the uncompensated moment , for a given particle volume and a given orientation , is then described by a hyperbolic tangent function similar to the expression for the hyperfine field ( eqn.[hhf ] ) , and the measured moment is obtained by integration over the random directions of the antiferromagnetic axis : @xmath131 , \\label{mnc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the function @xmath132 defined by : @xmath133 the @xmath132 function is plotted in the inset of fig.[comp ] together with the langevin function @xmath134 ; @xmath132 saturates at the value 1/2 , whereas the langevin law saturates at unity .",
    "the isothermal magnetization curves have been fitted with this model of dynamic `` random magnetic orientation '' , according to the law : @xmath135dv , \\label{mt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the lognormal volume distribution function .",
    "we chose to describe the uncompensated moments by their mean value : @xmath136 , where @xmath137 accounts for the thermal variation of a fe@xmath6 moment . in fig.[comp ] are represented the low field parts of the isothermal magnetization curves in the particles with 982 fe atoms per core , at 35k and 80k , together with the fits of the data using the @xmath132 function ( solid line ) and the langevin function ( dashed line ) with the same volume distribution .",
    "it is clear that the fit using the `` random magnetic orientation '' model gives a better account of the @xmath138 curvature at low fields than does the langevin fit , the improvement being more pronounced at low temperature .",
    "the complete field and temperature variation of the magnetization in the particles with 982 fe atoms per core is shown in fig.[aimh ] , the solid lines representing the fit using the `` random magnetic orientation '' model ( eqn.[mt ] ) .",
    "= 7 cm    these fits are very satisfactory in the whole field range , and the values for @xmath66 are about 0.6 ( close to those obtained in the mssbauer spectra at 90k at the lowest fields ) and slowly decrease as temperature increases .",
    "we emphasize that the description of the thermal and field variation of the uncompensated magnetization in the superparamagnetic regime using the @xmath132 function lies on stronger physical grounds than that using a langevin function .",
    "the upper bound of the field range where this approach is valid , as discussed in section [ exchange ] , is approximately @xmath139 , i.e. it is close to the maximum field ( 56 t ) used so far in magnetization studies of ferritin . above this field ,",
    "the uncompensated magnetization starts to decrease and vanishes when the field reaches the spin - flop threshold , as the uncompensated moments fluctuate along a direction close to perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "the @xmath132 function has been evoked by nel @xcite in his studies of antiferromagnetic particles : he applied it to calculate the thermoremanent magnetization at the blocking temperature and stated that it was the correct description of the uncompensated magnetization in the limit of strong anisotropy .",
    "this fact has also been noted by bean @xcite for the magnetization of ferromagnetic fine powders .",
    "we showed here that , in weakly uncompensated antiferromagnetic particles ( i.e. with a degree of uncompensation of a few percent ) , the @xmath132 function yields a correct description of the magnetization even for finite and rather small values of the anisotropy energy , like those found in ferric oxides , for fields up to 56 t .",
    "this is finally a consequence of the very large value of the exchange field , which yields a large spin - flop field .",
    "the thermal variation of the mean uncompensated moment derived from our fits of the @xmath138 curves presents a small but significant decrease as temperature increases from 35k to 250k , for all particle sizes . using an antiferromagnetic magnon law : @xmath140",
    ", the experimental @xmath141 curves can be extrapolated to zero in order to yield an estimation of the nel temperature .",
    "we find that @xmath12 is close to 500k , and that it is practically the same for all particle sets .",
    "this absence of dependence of @xmath12 on the mean particle size is probably due to the fact that the distance between `` active '' reticular planes , which determines the strength of the superexchange interaction , is independent of the particle size .",
    "the @xmath14 value we obtain is roughly two times larger than early estimations @xcite , but is in good agreement with more recent determinations @xcite in natural ferritin .",
    "the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath142 , shown in the inset of fig.[aimh ] for the particles with 982 fe atoms per core , decreases with increasing temperature , whereas the bulk powder antiferromagnetic susceptibility is expected to increase on heating .",
    "a mechanism for the thermal decrease of @xmath31 has been proposed by nel @xcite , by considering the reduced exchange field of the superficial fe layers , but it is difficult to say whether it is responsible for the thermal decrease of @xmath143 we observe in the ferritin particles .",
    "the @xmath13=0 value of @xmath31 , derived from the magnetization curves at 2.5k ( not shown here ) , amounts to a few 10@xmath144emu/@xmath2 for all particle sets . in the simple molecular field model ,",
    "the expression for the powder @xmath13=0 antiferromagnetic susceptibility is : @xmath145 . using the estimated exchange field value @xmath36=320 t",
    ", we find that , for each particle set , the calculated @xmath146 is smaller than the experimental value by a factor of about 3 .",
    "nel showed that the susceptibility of antiferromagnetic particles having an even number of `` active '' reticular planes ( i.e. no net magnetic moment ) can be enhanced by a factor 2 or more with respect to the bulk susceptibility , and that this is a surface effect visible in very small particles @xcite .",
    "he called this behaviour `` superantiferromagnetism '' .",
    "we think that this mechanism is effective for such particles even in the presence of a small uncompensated moment , and that it is responsible for the observed large value of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility .",
    "the superantiferromagnetic behaviour is confirmed by high field ( 30 t ) magnetisation measurements we performed at 2.5k in natural ferritin , which will be the subject of a future publication @xcite .    at this stage , we would like to comment on the observability of effects linked with surface atoms in antiferromagnetic particles . due to the small size of our particles ( 46 nm ) , an important fraction of fe atoms ( around 40% ) lie at the surface , and their properties ( anisotropy , exchange field ) are likely to be somehow different from those of the core atoms . for instance , in ferro- or ferrimagnetic systems , the observed lack of full alignment of the magnetic moments with the applied field is characteristic of nanoparticles and is generally attributed to the different behaviour of surface atoms @xcite . in antiferromagnetic particles in moderate magnetic fields , the situation is different because the dominant configuration is an almost random orientation of the moments with respect to the field .",
    "then , effects linked with surface moments are much more difficult to evidence experimentally and to distinguish from those due to core moments ( see however ref . ) .",
    "so , although the properties of surface atoms may be different from those of the core atoms in our artificial ferritin particles , we could not detect their effects in our experimental data , except for the superantiferromagnetic behaviour mentioned above .",
    "we performed @xmath0fe mssbauer absorption spectroscopy and magnetization measurements in antiferromagnetic artificial ferritin particles , with mean fe loadings ranging from 400 to 2500 atoms , in the temperature range 2.5k-250k and with magnetic fields up to 7 t . in zero or very low field ,",
    "the dynamics of the sublattice magnetization of the ferritin particles obeys classical superparamagnetic relaxation in the thermal activation regime .",
    "the value of the anisotropy energy per unit volume @xmath17 could be determined from the fc - zfc susceptibility curves and from the thermal variation of the mssbauer superparamagnetic fraction .",
    "the values obtained by both techniques are in good agreement and are in the range @xmath147ergs/@xmath2 , typical for ferric oxides or hydroxides , with a tendency for @xmath17 to increase as the particle size decreases . by comparing the data obtained by mssbauer spectroscopy and by magnetometry in moderate magnetic fields up to 7 t",
    ", we propose a new interpretation of the field and temperature behaviour of the uncompensated magnetization in the superparamagnetic regime .",
    "we show that it is better described by a `` random magnetic orientation '' model , where the uncompensated moments fluctuate along the antiferromagnetic axis , than by the usually assumed langevin law .",
    "this behaviour is described by the universal function : @xmath148 to our knowledge , this law has never been applied to the interpretation of data in antiferromagnetic particles , although nel had noticed that it should be the correct description of the thermal and field variation of the uncompensated magnetization in the limit of large anisotropy @xcite .",
    "we think this non - langevin behaviour actually holds for usual values of the anisotropy energy , and it should be valid not only in ferritin , but also in other weakly uncompensated antiferromagnetic particles , at least in moderate magnetic fields . as the field",
    "is increased towards the spin - flop field ( 1020 t ) and above , the `` random magnetic orientation '' picture breaks down , as the magnetic moments progressively reorient perpendicular to the applied field and the superparamagnetic uncompensated magnetization vanishes .    we could also estimate the nel temperature in our artificial ferritin samples by following the decrease of the mean uncompensated moment in the temperature range 35250k ; we find that @xmath14 is essentially independent of the mean particle size , and that it is close to 500k , in agreement with other recent estimations ."
