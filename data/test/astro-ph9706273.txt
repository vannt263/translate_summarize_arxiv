    "the hypothesis that novae hibernate in the millenia between outbursts predicts that very old novae should be much less luminous than those seen in the 20th century , because mass transfer in these systems has diminished or stopped entirely ( shara et al .",
    "nova hibernation theory has a serious drawback , though : not one old nova has ever clearly been shown to be hibernating ( naylor et al .",
    "1992 ; mukai & naylor 1995 ; somers et al .  1996 , 1997 ) . to test the theory , it is therefore essential to recover novae as old as possible . among the oldest novae listed in the catalog of duerbeck ( 1987 ) is v529 ori , or nova ori 1667 .",
    "our knowledge of v529 ori has had a complex history .",
    "it was discovered at @xmath0 by j.  hevelius during a lunar occultation .",
    "although claimed several times to be a recurrent nova , it probably is not one : all but the first account have been discredited as duplications of the original observation ( ashbrook 1963 ; duerbeck 1987 ; webbink et al .",
    "details surrounding the original observation , such as the date of observation , have also been called into question ( ashworth 1981 ) : it should be 1678 , not 1667 .",
    "recently , a newswire item in _ sky & telescope _ magazine reported that this nova had been recovered , and was in deep hibernation .",
    "this newswire item was originally uncredited , but it was written by r. t. fienberg ( r. t. fienberg , 1996 , private communication ) and so will be referenced here as fienberg ( 1995 ) .",
    "it was based on a poster paper by wagner et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although nova ori 1667 is not mentioned in the proceedings abstract .",
    "we took three @xmath1-band images and one h@xmath2 image of the field of v529 ori on 1993 august 15 and 16 ut with the 1.0-m jacobus kapteyn telescope at la palma .",
    "all images were taken in in 1.3  seeing .",
    "an eev ccd was used at the f/15 cassegrain focus , which yielded a pixel scale of 0.31  pixel@xmath3 a median of three bias frames was subtracted from each image , and the data were then flat - fielded using images of the twilight sky .",
    "we combined the @xmath1-band exposures into one image representing a total exposure of 1800 s. the h@xmath2 image was a 1000-s exposure .",
    "the resulting images are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "star 5 , using the numbers in the image of fienberg ( 1995 ) , was reported by this author to be the hibernating nova .",
    "our images clearly show there are two components .",
    "astrometry with the guide star catalog ( russell et al .",
    "1990 ) showed the 1950.0 positions , to within 0.4  absolute and 0.1  relative , of component a to be @xmath2 05  55  15.574  @xmath4  + 20  15  55.88 , and of component b to be @xmath2 05  55  15.638  @xmath4  + 20  15  55.22 .",
    "spectra of both components were taken on 1995 february 8 , beginning at 1:56 and 2:29 ut , with the isis spectrograph of the 4.2-m william herschel telescope at la palma .",
    "the r158r and r158b gratings were used with tek ccds .",
    "the slit was 0.73  wide on the sky , and was set to a position angle of 26.0 degrees , perpendicular to the line intersecting the centers of both stars .",
    "the parallactic angle at the time varied from 68.5 to 67.5 degrees .",
    "seeing was 0.9  1.0 , and weather was photometric .",
    "the dispersion was 2.9   pixel@xmath5 and the exposure times for both sets of red and blue exposures was 1800 s. a standard reduction was carried out , in which the frames were debiased , flat - fielded with exposures of tungsten lamps , wavelength - calibrated using cu - ne and cu - ar lamps , sky - subtracted , and flux - calibrated with the spectrum of the standard feige 34 ( stone 1977 ) .",
    "the spectrum of a nearby f8 star , sao 077760 , was also taken , to map the telluric absorption bands to allow their removal .",
    "the resulting spectra of both components of candidate 5 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios are about 20 near h@xmath2 in both red spectra and about 5 for star a and 10 for star b near h@xmath6 in the blue spectra .",
    "the only features obvious in the red spectra are h@xmath7 in emission , and the tio absorption bands at @xmath87165 and 7665  . the blue spectra show only faint mg b @xmath9 5175   in star b. by comparison with vilnius dwarf spectra ( sviderskiene 1988 )",
    ", we estimate spectral types of m0.5 @xmath10 0.5 for star a and k7.5 @xmath10 0.5 for star b. h@xmath2 has equivalent widths of 7.3 @xmath10 0.5   and 22.8 @xmath10 0.8   and full - widths at half - maxima of @xmath11  and @xmath12  in stars a and b , respectively . since radial velocity standards were not taken , it is impossible to quote reliable absolute values for these stars radial velocities , but the h@xmath2 lines show a difference of @xmath13  between stars a and b.    despite probable light losses through the slit , we deconvolved johnson - kron broad - band magnitudes from the spectra .",
    "the only bands completely covered were @xmath14 and @xmath15 we found @xmath16 for star a and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for star b ; low signal - to - noise in the blue prevented such a measurement for a. assuming that star b is a k7  m0 dwarf , its colors ( bessell 1991 ) and the extinction law of howarth ( 1983 ) would imply @xmath19 and a distance between 1.5 and 1.9 kpc . although star a is brighter , it is redder , although these spectra can not distinguish its luminosity class .",
    "the component stars of most classical novae are k  m dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs .",
    "warner ( 1995 , equation 9.54 ) uses the calculations of prialnik ( 1986 ) to find that @xmath20^{-0.28}~\\rm{k},$ ] where @xmath21 is the effective temperature and @xmath22 is the time in years since eruption .",
    "this applies to a nova with a 1.25-@xmath23 white dwarf , and novae with massive white dwarfs should have much higher discovery probabilities ( ritter et al .",
    "the white dwarf in a 300-year - old nova should therefore have @xmath24  k. white dwarfs this hot are observed to have @xmath25 ( wesemael , green , & liebert 1985 ) and @xmath26 ( sion & liebert 1977 ) . in @xmath14 and @xmath27",
    "therefore , any white dwarf present should have absolute magnitudes comparable to or brighter than those of m0 or k7 dwarfs , with @xmath28 and 9.55 and @xmath29 and 8.23 ( bessell 1991 ) , respectively .",
    "we see no obvious sign of a hot white dwarf in our red or blue spectra , however , nor of an accretion disk : if either candidate 5a or 5b is the hibernating nova , it is in very deep hibernation indeed . alternatively , these could just be m0 and k7 stars , and the nova has not yet been recovered .",
    "these stars h@xmath2 equivalent widths seem high for m0 or k7 dwarfs , which more typically are near 2   ( linsky et al .",
    "however , t tauri stars abound in orion , and h@xmath2 emission from their accretion disks has equivalent widths ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31    ( jaschek & jaschek 1987 ) .",
    "radial velocity studies could demonstrate whether either candidates 5a or 5b are close binary stars . until then , however , or until a more convincing candidate has been found , this nova  if indeed it was a nova  should be considered unrecovered .",

    "the jacobus kapteyn and william herschel telescopes are operated on la palma by the royal greenwich observatory at the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
    "some analysis was done with the ark software on the keele starlink node ."
