    "in quantum mechanics , the density operator @xmath0 of a quantum system is called a stationary state if @xmath1=0 $ ] , where @xmath2 is a given time - independent hamiltonian of the system .",
    "since @xmath0 satisfies the liouville - von neumann equation @xmath3 $ ] , it is clear that stationary states are invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time evolution operator . in other words ,",
    "stationary states do not change during the time evolution .    for low - dimensional closed systems ,",
    "the stationary states can be obtained relatively easily  @xcite .",
    "it is a common situation , that a small quantum system is immersed in other , mostly large , system called the environment  @xcite .",
    "such an open system does not evolve unitarily in time .",
    "an analysis of open quantum systems  @xcite is much more complicated as they are a stage of a variety of physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the famous decoherence process  @xcite may serve as an example .",
    "in open quantum systems character of potentially existing stationary states is not obvious .",
    "there are various physical problems related to the properties of open quantum systems , which has already been addressed and intensively discussed ( see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure of deriving stationary states is not one of them . the existence and properties of stationary states have significant importance in quantum information processing and quantum theory itself .",
    "one can pose natural questions :    1 .   do the stationary states exist for a given open system ? 2 .",
    "what features of a given model are responsible for existence of such states ? 3 .",
    "how such states can be constructed ?    the answers to the above questions are still incomplete .",
    "for example , it is known that the stationary states exist for completely positive ( cp )  @xcite evolution of the open system , this fact follows directly from schauder fixed point theorem  @xcite .",
    "however , this is only an existential result and so far there are no available methods to determine explicit form of stationary states .",
    "furthermore , the very existence of the stationary states in general case is an open problem _",
    "e.g. _ , in the presence of initial system - environment correlations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose the method of calculating the stationary states in the case of two - dimensional open quantum system .",
    "the theory of block operator matrices  @xcite is adapted to achieve this goal .",
    "in particular , we use the _ riccati operator equation _  @xcite to solve the eigenproblem for the total hamiltonian .",
    "it is shown how to derive the stationary states by using the solution of the equation .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the block operator matrices approach to the problem of decoherence in the case of a single qubit  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be the hamiltonian of the total system .",
    "we will assume that it has the following form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the hamiltonian of the qubit and the environment , respectively , while @xmath10 specifies the interaction between the systems .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 acts on the hilbert space @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hilbert space ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) related to the environment .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the identity operators on @xmath15 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "since the isomorphism @xmath16 holds true , the hamiltonian  ( [ total ] ) admits the block operator matrix representation  @xcite :    @xmath17    all the entries of  ( [ bom ] ) are operators acting on @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the diagonal entries , _ i.e. _ , @xmath18 are self - adjoint . in this paper , we will focus on the case in which @xmath19 is bounded , thus @xmath20 is bounded as well ; however , no assumption on boundedness of @xmath18 is made . under these circumstances we have @xmath21 , where domains @xmath22 are assumed to be dense in @xmath12 .",
    "the generally accepted procedure to obtain the reduced time evolution of the open system , the so - called reduced dynamics , reads",
    "@xmath23 \\equiv t_t(\\rho_0).\\ ] ]    above , @xmath24 specifies the state of the open system at @xmath25 . the map @xmath26 assigns to each initial state @xmath24 a single state @xmath27 of the total system .",
    "the assignment map must be chosen properly so that @xmath28 can be well - defined  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if no correlations between the systems are initially present , then @xmath29 , for some initial state of the environment @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , if the initial state can not be factorized , the definition of @xmath26 is not accessible  @xcite .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath31 describes the time evolution of the total system .",
    "the map @xmath32 denotes the so - called partial trace :    @xmath33    @xmath34 refers to the usual trace operation on @xmath12 , @xmath35 denotes the banach space of trace classes operator with the trace norm : @xmath36 , whereas @xmath37 is the banach space of @xmath38 complex matrices .",
    "note , the partial trace is a linear operation transforming the block operator matrices ( square brackets ) to the ordinary matrices ( round brackets ) .",
    "fixed point theorems like banach or schauder indicate the existence of stationary states for a given evolution @xmath28 .",
    "however , there is no general analytical procedure to obtain explicit form of such states . in this section",
    "we propose a method of deriving stationary states for two - level open quantum systems .",
    "the generalization to the higher - dimensions seems to be possible .",
    "however , we will not deal with this issue in this paper .",
    "we begin with some definitions .",
    "the density matrix @xmath0 is said to be a stationary state if it is invariant with respect to reduced evolution , @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be an operator acting on the hilbert space @xmath41 .",
    "the subset @xmath42 of @xmath43 defined as    @xmath44    is said to be the graph of @xmath40 .",
    "the graph of a linear and closed operator is a subset of the hilbert space , which is a hilbert space itself equipped with the inner product    @xmath45    @xmath46 is an inner product on @xmath12 . it is a known fact ( see lemma @xmath47 in  @xcite ) that the graph @xmath42 is @xmath48invariant , that is @xmath49 if and only if @xmath40 is a bounded solution ( with @xmath50 ) of the _ riccati _ equation :    @xmath51    along with the equation above we introduce the dual riccati equation , namely    @xmath52    it is proved in  @xcite that @xmath53 is a solution ( with @xmath54 ) of  ( [ ricc2 ] ) if and only if the orthogonal complement of @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the subspace    @xmath55    is @xmath6-invariant .",
    "it is straightforward to see that a bounded operator @xmath40 solves  ( [ ricc ] ) if and only if @xmath56 is a solution of  ( [ ricc2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 as well as @xmath57 are @xmath48invariant if and only if @xmath40 is a bounded solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath42 is reducing subspace of @xmath6 if and only if @xmath40 is a bounded solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) . from considerations above",
    "follow also that @xmath42 and @xmath57 are @xmath58invariant .",
    "[ def ] elements from the graph and its orthogonal complement are denoted by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the riccati states are defined as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are _ not _ normalized with respect to the norm induced by the inner product  ( [ inner ] ) .",
    "moreover , the states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not factorisable ( _ i.e. _ , correlations occur ) , unless @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "however , they are @xmath69invariant , which is obvious because the vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath58invariant . as a consequence ,",
    "the riccati states @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath72invariant , where the map @xmath28 has been defined in  ( [ reduced ] ) .",
    "therefore , the set of all the riccati states is invariant under the time evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the riccati states are not the stationary states , in general .",
    "however , we show that the latter can be found among the riccati states . to be specific",
    ", we will prove the following    [ th1 ] let @xmath40 be a bounded solution of the riccati equation  . then    1 .",
    "the riccati state @xmath70 is a stationary state if the vector @xmath73 is a eigenvector of the operator @xmath74 , 2 .",
    "the riccati state @xmath75 is a stationary state if the vector @xmath76 is a eigenvector of the operator @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "from  ( [ ricc ] ) we obtain that @xmath81 , hence in view of  ( [ bom ] ) the last equality leads to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the vector state @xmath59 is the eigenvector of the total hamiltonian with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath6 is self - adjoint we have @xmath84 and in consequence @xmath85 , which ultimately leads to @xmath86 .",
    "in a comparable manner we have @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 so that @xmath90 . just as before @xmath91 , therefore @xmath92 .    at this point , some remarks , regarding theorem given above , should be made .",
    "the question whether all stationary states are riccati states or if it is possible that stationary states exist that are not riccati states is still open .",
    "[ re1 ] since the space @xmath93 is closed , we have the following decomposition @xmath94 .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian is similar to certain block diagonal operator matrix , @xmath95 , where    @xmath96    this , implies that @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath98 are exactly the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a bounded solution of  ( [ ricc ] ) .",
    "@xmath19 is assumed to be bounded as well . from the definition of @xmath98 we have @xmath99 , and thus @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath40 solves the riccati equation  ( [ ricc ] ) , it is clear that @xmath101 . to prove",
    "@xmath102 we will show that @xmath103 is invertible and @xmath104 is bounded .",
    "indeed , @xmath105 , where    @xmath106    since @xmath107 , the spectrum of @xmath108 is a subset of the imaginary axis .",

    "@xmath115 , @xmath116 are the normalization constants and @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 , the equations  ( [ explicit ] ) can be obtained directly from the definition  ( [ def ] ) and the formula  ( [ partial ] ) .",
    "in this subsection we will demonstrate an application of the presented method to a non - trivial example , namely , the paradigmatic spin - boson model  @xcite .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian of the qubit ( spin - half ) and its environment ( boson ) are in the following forms    @xmath119    respectively .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider only the case of a single boson .",
    "the interaction between the systems reads    @xmath120    in the above description , @xmath121 , @xmath122 are the standard pauli matrices and @xmath123 .",

    "parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 represent the energy of the boson and the coupling constant between the qubit and the environment , respectively .",
    "if @xmath129 ( no energy exchange between the systems ) , the model can be solved , _",
    "i.e. _ , the reduced dynamics can be obtained exactly  @xcite .",
    "the solution describes the physical phenomena known as the pure decoherence or dephasing  @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath130 the exact solution in not known .",
    "the objective is to estimate the stationary states for the latter case . to proceed ,",
    "we must clarify some technical aspects ( _ e.g. _ , domains of @xmath18 ) .",
    "clearly , the operators @xmath125 and @xmath124 can not both be bounded since the trace of their commutator does not vanish  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ccr holds only on some dense subspace @xmath131 of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath132 be the dense domain of both @xmath125 and @xmath124 , on which they are mutually adjoint , that is , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "at this point , it is not obvious that the sets @xmath132 , @xmath131 , having desire properties , exist . the detailed construction can be found in  @xcite and the right choice is given by    @xmath135    on @xmath132 the creation and annihilation operators can be defined explicitly as ( see also  @xcite )    @xmath136    @xmath137 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath138 . from  ( [ aa ] )",
    "follows that @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which in most books on quantum mechanics is a definition of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "however , the operators defined in such a way are not closed ; nevertheless , they are closable and their closures are given by  ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "since @xmath125 is closed , @xmath141 is a positive self - adjoint operator and @xmath142 is a core of @xmath125 ( see _ e.g. _ , theorem 4.2.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "henceforward , we assume that the basis @xmath137 is composed with the eigenvectors of @xmath141 . in this case",
    "we have    @xmath143    by choosing a suitable coupling constant @xmath144 , it is possible to make @xmath145 self - adjoint on @xmath146 . to see this ,",
    "let us first note that @xmath147 , thus @xmath19 is hermitian ( symmetric ) . since @xmath141 is self - adjoint and @xmath19 hermitian , it is sufficient to show that @xmath19 is relatively bounded with respect to @xmath141 ( @xmath141 bounded ) and with @xmath141-bound less than one .",
    "the fundamental result of perturbation theory , known as the kato - rellich theorem  @xcite assure hermiticity of @xmath18 in this case .",
    "recall that @xmath148 is @xmath149 bounded if i ) @xmath150 and ii ) @xmath151 , for all @xmath152 and some nonnegative constants @xmath125 , @xmath153 .",
    "the infimum of all @xmath125 for which a corresponding @xmath153 exists such that the last inequality holds is called @xmath154bound of @xmath148 .",
    "note , sometimes it is convenient to replace the condition ii ) by the equivalent one : @xmath155 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if two operators @xmath156 , @xmath157 are bounded with respect to the same operator @xmath149 and their relative bound are less than @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively ; then @xmath160 is also @xmath149 bounded and its relative bounded is less than @xmath161 ( see lemma 6.1 in  @xcite ) . in other words , the set of all @xmath149 bounded operator form a linear space .",
    "therefore , to see that @xmath19 is @xmath141 bounded it is sufficient to prove that both @xmath125 and @xmath124 are @xmath141 bounded . to finish this note    @xmath162    in comparable manner",
    "one can also verify that @xmath163 . since @xmath164bound of both @xmath125 and @xmath124 is less than one ,",

    "it is important to stress that to obtain the exact reduced dynamics for the model in question one needs to resolve an eigenvalue problem for @xmath98 .      in the second example we consider the hamiltonian in the following form    @xmath198    here we assume that linear , bounded operators @xmath199 , @xmath200 commute . in this example we impose restriction to the spectra of @xmath199 and @xmath200 , _ i.e. _",
