    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is a mechanism by which the magnetic field can destabilize a hydrodynamically stable flow of a conducting fluid without altering its velocity distribution .",
    "the mri was first discovered theoretically in cylindrical taylor - couette ( tc ) flow of perfectly conducting fluid subject to an axial magnetic field @xcite .",
    "three decades later , balbus and hawley @xcite suggested that the mri may account for the fast formation of stars by driving turbulent transport of angular momentum in accretion disks .",
    "this proposition has triggered not only numerous theoretical studies @xcite but also several attempts to reproduce the mri in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a major challenge to such experiments is posed by the parameter known as the magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 , which is required to be at least @xmath2 for the mri to set in . for a typical liquid metal , characterized by a small magnetic prandtl number @xmath3",
    "this translates into a large hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath4 @xcite . at such large reynolds numbers",
    ", the flow on which the mri is expected to develop may become turbulent due to purely hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite .    a way to circumvent this problem",
    "was proposed by hollerbach and rdiger @xcite , who suggested that a magnetorotational - type instability can take place in cylindrical tc flow at @xmath5 when the imposed magnetic field is helical rather than purely axial as for the standard mri ( smri ) .",
    "an instability resembling this new type helical mri ( hmri ) was shortly thereafter observed in the promise experiment @xcite .",
    "these observations were disputed by liu _",
    "@xcite , who found no such instability in their inviscid theoretical analysis of finite length cylinders with insulating end caps .",
    "subsequently , the observed phenomenon was conjectured to be a transient growth rather than a self - sustained instability @xcite .",
    "this proposition was , in turn , opposed by priede and gerbeth @xcite , who showed that there is not only a convective but also an absolute hmri threshold .",
    "thus , a self - sustained hmri can experimentally be observed in a system of sufficiently large axial extension .",
    "however , the comparison with the experimental results revealed that the hmri has been observed slightly beyond the range of its absolute instability , where it is expected according to ideal tc flow model .",
    "this discrepancy implies a deviation of the real base flow from the tc one , which may be caused by the end effects .",
    "one such end effect disturbing the base flow in the original promise experiment was due to the copper end cap , which allowed radial electric current to connect over the liquid gap between the cylinders @xcite .",
    "this flaw was corrected in the modified promise experiment , where an insulating end cap was used , which , in order to reduce the ekman pumping , was split into two separately rotating rings @xcite .",
    "although the instability appeared much sharper in the modified setup than in the original one , its nature may still be questionable .",
    "uncertainty is due to the virtually unknown hydrodynamic stability limit of the real base flow , whose deviation from ideal tc flow was significant and practically unavoidable in the experiment . without knowing the actual hydrodynamic limit it is practically impossible to distinguish the hmri from a magnetically modified taylor vortex flow @xcite .",
    "regardless of the experimental reproducibility , the hmri is also of a questionable astrophysical relevance . using a wkb analysis liu _",
    "et al_. @xcite showed that however the hmri is able to destabilize centrifugally stable velocity distributions , it does not reach up to the astrophysically relevant keplerian rotation profile .",
    "this claim was doubted by rdiger and hollerbach @xcite , who pointed out that according to the numerical results for the tc flow in a finite - width gap @xcite , the hmri can apparently reach the keplerian rotation profile provided that at least one of the boundaries is sufficiently conducting .",
    "however , it is important to note that this conclusion concerns only the convective hmri , which is not generally self - sustained and requires an external excitation to be effective .",
    "no destabilizing effect due to conducting boundaries was observed for the absolute instability threshold @xcite . although the extension of the absolute hmri beyond the rayleigh line was found to increase with the strength and helicity of the magnetic field , the previous study was unable to conclude whether the keplerian velocity profile is attainable .",
    "the problem was the excessive numerical resolution required for the thin boundary layers developing in strong magnetic field .",
    "however , the hmri does not appear to be related with the boundary layers , whose main function is to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition imposed by the viscosity .",
    "these redundant boundary layers can be eliminated by ignoring the viscosity , which appears to be insignificant for astrophysical conditions . in this paper , fluid is considered not only inviscid but also highly electrically resistive .",
    "it means that the magnetic prandtl number is assumed to be zero regardless of the viscosity , which corresponds to the inductionless approximation @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate numerically whether the astrophysically relevant keplerian rotation profile can be attained by inviscid hmri in cylindrical tc flow when a finite - width annulus is considered .",
    "the obtained results show that only convective hmri mode can reach the kepler limit provided that the boundaries are perfectly conducting .",
    "however , this mode requires not only a permanent external excitation to be observable but also has a long wave length , which is incompatible with limited thickness of accretion disks .",
    "the absolute hmri as well as the convective one at insulating boundaries are found to obey the liu limit also for a finite - width annulus .",
    "this is because the maximum extension of the hmri beyond the rayleigh line is attained when the magnetic field is nearly azimuthal , which results in a short - wave instability as in the local wkb approximation .",

    "the main question is whether this limit includes the keplerian velocity profile @xmath158 a simple approximation of the keplerian profile with the tc one leads to @xmath159 for @xmath0 under consideration here . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - bt ] , the hmri certainly persists beyond this limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower liu limit ( [ eq : ro - pm ] ) substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ro ] ) yields @xmath160 which appears to be the asymptote approached by @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - bt ] .",
    "it means that the hmri obeys the liu limit not only for a thin but also for a finite - width gap . but this obviously contradicts the above conjecture that the hmri can affect the keplerian profile , whose rossby number according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ro - k ] ) lies beyond the liu limit and yields@xmath161 indeed , this ratio of rotation rates is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - bt ] to lie significantly above that for the liu limit .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath162 is an integral criterion based on the difference of angular velocity over the gap width .",
    "the velocity difference for the tc profile coinciding with that for the keplerian profile means that only the average velocity gradients of both profiles are the same .",
    "since the velocity profiles are different , the tc profile will be in some parts of the gap shallower and in some other parts steeper than that of the keplerian profile @xcite .",
    "therefore , simple approximation of the keplerian profile by the tc one based on the total velocity variation may be misleading .",
    "this becomes obvious by considering the radial gradient term of the specific angular momentum given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : m - rad ] ) , which determines the centrifugal stability .",
    "this is also the key parameter for the hmri",
    ", whose critical value is modified by helical magnetic field as shown by the narrow - gap approximation . expression ( [ eq : m - rad ] ) defines the local slope of the specific angular momentum profile , which is constant for tc flow and can be expressed in terms of either @xmath131 or @xmath163 then it is easy to see that the slope of tc flow profile corresponding to @xmath162 is indeed considerably lower than the local slope of the keplerian profile defined by eq .",

    "this paper presented the analysis of the hmri in the astrophysically relevant limit of a vanishing viscosity . in order to focus on the hmri ,",
    "the analysis was carried out in the inductionless approximation defined by zero magnetic prandtl number @xmath164 , which excludes the standard mri .",
    "these assumptions resulted in the problem defined by a single dimensionless parameter , the elsasser number , also referred to as the mhd interaction parameter , which characterizes the ratio of electromagnetic and inertial forces . using a chebyshev collocation method convective and absolute instability thresholds",
    "were numerically calculated with respect to axisymmetric perturbations of cylindrical tc flow subject to a helical magnetic field . without the magnetic field ,",
    "the flow becomes centrifugally unstable when the specific angular momentum of fluid at the inner cylinder exceeds that at the outer one . according to the previous wkb analysis",
    ", a strong magnetic field has a stabilizing effect , but a weak field of certain helicity can destabilize some centrifugally stable velocity distributions lying beyond the so - called rayleigh line . the latter defines the limit of the centrifugal instability in terms of the critical ratio of rotation rates for a given gap width between the cylinders .",
    "however , in the wkb approximation , the extension of the instability beyond the rayleigh line is constrained by the so - called liu limit and does not reach up to the astrophysically relevant keplerian velocity profile .",
    "the obtained numerical results show that the liu limit is obeyed also by the nonlocal solution for a finite width gap between the cylinders except for perfectly conducting boundaries .",
    "maximal extension of the absolute hmri as well as that of the convective hmri at insulating boundaries is attained when the magnetic field is nearly azimuthal , which produces a short - wave instability as in the wkb approximation .",
    "the short - wave character of the instability explains why the nonlocal solution obeys the liu limit and why it may also apply to other gap widths rather than just the case of @xmath0 considered in this study .",
    "moreover , the short wave length implies that the absolute instability , which formally applies to the systems of infinite axial extension , may be relevant also for relatively thin disks .",
    "this is because the absolute instability , as discussed at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sub : abso ] , represents the limit of the global instability with respect to the wave packets of finite length .",
    "the wave packets formed by two short waves with slightly different wave numbers can fit in the relatively thin disks .    in the case of perfectly conducting boundaries ,",
    "the instability can extend sufficiently far beyond the rayleigh line to reach the astrophysically relevant keplerian velocity profile .",
    "however , this is the case only for the convective instability mode , which is not self - sustained and thus requires an external excitation to be effective .",
    "moreover , as the ratio of rotation rates increases further beyond the rayleigh line , this instability mode shifts to ever longer waves .",
    "first , due to its long wave length this mode is not only inherently nonlocal but also unable to fit within limited thickness of accretion disks .",
    "second , the critical interaction parameter for this mode approaching zero implies that its growth rate approaches zero too . as a result , this weak instability can be suppressed by a finite viscous damping , which also limits its extension beyond the rayleigh line @xcite .",
    "given these three basic constraints , the hmri at perfectly conduction boundaries seems of a little astrophysical relevance , too .",
    "note that the liu limit appears only in the inductionless approximation , which , however , captures the essence of hmri . at nonzero @xmath165 instability",
    "can extend beyond the liu limit @xcite .",
    "obviously , the hmri can extend similarly to the smri up to the velikhov - chandrasekhar limit corresponding to the solid - body rotation .",
    "however , this extension is due to the smri , in which hmri merges with at a sufficiently high reynolds number @xcite . for small @xmath165 the merging point ,",
    "at which the hmri loses its identity by turning into the smri , is located only slightly above the liu limit @xcite .",
