    "we display the median sed of optically thick disk stars in taurus @xcite and the photospheric fluxes for a star with spectral type m2 @xcite .",
    "the diversity of disks in the @xmath1 velorum cluster is apparent .",
    "we distinguish between class ii systems ( cii , with sed slopes k-[5.8]@xmath71.8 ) , and evolved disk ( ev ) systems exhibiting smaller irac / mips excesses than class ii systems ( k-[5.8]@xmath41.8 ) .",
    "two stars have photometric colors between k5 and m0 ; one of them ( star 52 ) shows infrared excesses similar to pre - transitional disks objects @xcite .",
    "the other star ( 106 ) exhibits larger infrared excesses than the optically thick median in taurus .",
    "the next two objects ( stars 559 and 78 ) , with photometric spectral type @xmath0 m3 , exhibit modest infrared emission , which could be explained by decreasing the height of the irradiation surface in the disks due to a higher degree of settling producing flatter disk structures @xcite .",
    "the remaining 13 stars with infrared excesses have photometric spectral types m4 or later ( see figure [ fig : cmd2 ] ) suggesting , as in other young stellar population @xcite that primordial disk frequencies depend on the mass of the central object . using the number of members expected in our photometric sample ( dashed histogram in figure [ fig : cmd2 ] ) , we calculated disk fractions of 4.3@xmath203.0% for the color range 2@xmath4v - j@xmath43 ( @xmath0k5-m1 ) , 3.5@xmath202.4% for the color range 3@xmath4v - j@xmath44 ( @xmath0m1-m3.5 ) and 7.1@xmath202.0% for stars in with v - j@xmath74 ( later than m3.5 ) .",
    "stars 100 , 154 , 155 are too faint to be detected by mips .",
    "two of them show excesses in all irac bands , making identification of these stars ( 100 and 155 ) as having dust disks fairly certain .",
    "however , star 154 shows excess only at 8 , which could be produced by either disk emission or pah contamination .",
    "figure [ fig : space ] shows the spatial distribution of the stars with infrared excesses in our sample .",
    "different spectral type ranges are represented with different symbols . as reference",

    "the projected distances from the @xmath1 velorum system are displayed in intervals of 0.5 pc .",
    "one debris disk is located inside 0.25 pc , while the only optically - thick disks are in systems located at projected distances of @xmath130.5 pc . since ,",
    "about 10% of the stars bearing disks are expected to have transitional disks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; muzerolle j. , in preparation ) , we can expect one or two transitional disks in the @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "however , we did not detect any transitional disk objects in the cluster .",
    "we can speculate that external mechanisms of disk dispersal ( like photodissociation and/or photoionization by strong stellar winds and/or strong uv radiation ) , affecting mainly the disk surface and the outer region of the disk , combined with the fast inner clearing characterizing transitional disks , decrease the probability of observing a disk in this phase .",
    "given the small number of stars bearing disks , the statistical significance of this speculation is very low .",
    "to compare the disk frequencies in @xmath1 vel with other regions , we need to estimate the cluster age , which depends to some extent upon the assumed distance to the cluster .",
    "@xcite confirmed that this group is a stellar cluster belonging to the vela ob2 association , analogous to the @xmath9 orionis cluster in the orion ob1b subassociation @xcite .",
    "the primary star in the @xmath1 vel system is the only wr star with a distance from hipparcos ( 258@xmath28pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but this distance is in marked contrast to distances estimated by other methods ( 350 - 450 pc ) and to the hipparcos distance of the vela ob2 association ( 410@xmath2012 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using interferometric observations to estimate the geometrical parameters of the orbit of the @xmath1 vel system , @xcite and @xcite give distances of 368@xmath29 and 336@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these values are in agreement with the distance obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pc ) with the new reduction of the hipparcos data that includes modeling of the satellite dynamics and eliminates the data correlation in the original catalog caused by attitude - modeling errors @xcite .",
    "the age estimated by ( 3.5 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the o star is in agreement with the age estimated by ( @xmath25 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the cluster and the age estimated by ( 3.6 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the @xmath1 vel system .",
    "we assume the corrected hipparcos distance of 350 pc , which is in agreement within 1.5@xmath9 from the distance calculated by @xcite and @xcite and a reference age of 5 myr .    to support the assumed age , we plot in figure [ fig : cmd3 ] the median absolute magnitudes versus the median v - j color for members of several different stellar groups .",
    "regardless of the uncertainties introduced by theoretical evolutionary tracks , figure [ fig : cmd3 ] shows that the @xmath1 velorum cluster is in a similar evolutionary stage as the other stellar groups with ages normally quoted as @xmath05 myr : the @xmath31 orionis cluster @xcite , the cluster ngc 2362 @xcite , and the orion ob1b subassociation @xcite .",
    "we estimate an error of 1.5 myr comparing the standard deviation in the color v - j for the member sample ( see  [ s : mem ] ) to the standard deviation obtained using the theoretical isochrones from @xcite with a reference age of 5 myr .",
    "figure [ fig : fracd ] shows the disk frequencies of late type stars ( stars k middle or later ) with near - infrared disk emission in different stellar groups , as a function of age @xcite . using the number of members with v - j@xmath72.0 ( @xmath0k5 or later ) expected in our photometric sample ( dashed histogram in figure [ fig : cmd2 ] ) and the disk detected in  [ s : late ] , we calculated a primordial disk frequency of 6@xmath202% for the @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "we include recent spitzer results for the young stellar clusters ngc 1333 @xcite , ngc 2068/71@xcite , taurus @xcite , ngc 7129 @xcite , chameleons @xcite , tr 37 and ngc 7160 @xcite , ic 348 @xcite , ngc 2244 @xcite , ngc 2264 @xcite , @xmath9 ori @xcite , ngc 2362 @xcite , @xmath31 ori @xcite , upper scorpius @xcite , and orion ob1b and 25 ori @xcite .",
    "the disk frequencies decrease toward older ages with a time scale for primordial disk dissipation of @xmath05 myr .",
    "it is apparent that the disk frequency found in the @xmath1 velorum cluster is lower than those found in young stellar populations with similar ages , and comparable to the disk frequency in older stellar groups .",
    "this could indicate that the low disk presence observed in the @xmath1 velorum cluster is abnormal for its evolutionary stage , and environmental effects , such as strong stellar winds and/or strong radiation fields from the @xmath1 velorum system , could provide the physical mechanism for the low disk frequency .",
    "moreover , @xmath075% of the disk bearing stars in the @xmath1 velorum cluster show irac sed slopes smaller than the median values of other 5 myr old stellar groups plotted in figure [ fig : cmd3 ] suggesting that the disks of the @xmath1 velorum cluster have a higher degree of dust settling .",
    "in particular , the median irac sed slopes for the disk population of ngc2362 , the @xmath31 orionis cluster , the ob1b subassociation and the @xmath1 velorum cluster are -1.72 , -1.60 , -1.70 and -1.82 , respectively ( with a typical error of 0.06 ) .",
    "studying the young ( 2 - 3 myr ) open cluster ngc2244 , @xcite showed that high - mass stars ( o type stars ) can affect the primordial disks of lower mass members only if they are within @xmath00.5 pc of the high - mass star .",
    "we find similar results for the @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "using the photometric members with v - j@xmath73.5 ( @xmath0m2 or later ) , we find a disk frequency of 4@xmath203% at projected distance of 0.25 - 1.0 pc ; inside 0.25 pc the central objects of the cluster contaminate the optical photometry used to select photometric candidates (  [ s : mem ] ) .",
    "the closest primordial disk is located at projected distance of @xmath00.5 pc .",
    "at larger projected distance ( @xmath71.0 pc ) , the disk frequency is larger ( 8@xmath202% ) .",
    "this suggests that the relative fast dispersion of disks in the @xmath1 velorum cluster is produced by the strong radiation fields and strong stellar winds from the central objects .",
    "this result must still be considered tentative given the small number of stars with disks , which results in large errors in disk frequencies .",
    "alternatively , figure [ fig : fracd ] indicates that the disk frequency drops rapidly at @xmath05 myr and the relative low frequency of disks observed in the @xmath1 velorum cluster could be explained if the cluster is slightly older than 5 myr .",
    "additional studies of photometric members presented in table [ tab : members ] are necessary to explain the disk population found in @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "we have used the irac and mips instruments on board the spitzer space telescope to conduct a study of disks around the @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "since the central object is a binary system consisting of the closest known wolf rayet star and a high mass o star , a strong uv radiation field and stellar winds are present in the cluster . using optical photometry of x ray sources ( 2xmm ) and members confirmed by spectroscopy ( jeffries r.d .",
    "et al , in preparation ) , 579 photometric candidates were selected as possible members of the cluster .",
    "the level of contamination by non - members depends on the v - j color range , showing the highest level of contamination ( @xmath068% ) at v - j = 1.5 - 3.5 , where the field giant branch crosses the young stellar population . combining optical , 2mass and spitzer data we have detected infrared excess in 29 stars .",
    "one of the infrared excess stars is a be star .",
    "we report 5 debris disks around a type stars , 5 debris disks around solar type stars ( spectral type range f - early - k ) and one solar type stars with infrared excess produced by a very massive debris disks or by a primordial disk with a high degree of dust settling .",
    "seventeen disk bearing low mass stars ( k5 or later ) were found in the cluster with a range of disk properties .",
    "we classified these objects in three classes using the infrared excess at 5.8 and the sed slope [ 8.0]-[24 ] : 9 class ii stars , 7 evolved disks star and one pretransitional candidate .",
    "we found that 76% of the stars bearing primordial disks have color v - j@xmath74 ( @xmath0later than m3.5 ) , indicating a mass dependent timescale for disk dissipation in the @xmath1 velorum cluster , similar to results in other young star populations @xcite .",
    "we found that the disk frequency observed in the @xmath1 velorum cluster is lower than in other young stellar groups with similar ages ( @xmath05 myr ) , and comparable to values found in older populations ( @xmath010myr ) .",
    "empirical isochrones support the age of @xmath05 myr for the overall population of the @xmath1 velorum cluster .",
    "the relative low frequency observed in the cluster is consistent with : ( 1 ) rapid disk dissipation due to the influence of the strong radiation fields and winds from the wr and o star cluster members or ( 2 ) the age of the cluster is slightly older and the low frequency reflects the fast dropping in disk frequency observed at @xmath05 myr .",
    "more than 75% of the primordial disk stars have inner disk emission lower than the median observed in the disk population of other 5 myr clusters , indicating that the disks of the @xmath1 velorum cluster have a larger degree of dust settling .",
    "we find no primordial disks closer than @xmath00.75 pc from the high mass central binary . at projected distance @xmath71 pc",
    ", the disk fraction seems to be constant around 5 - 7% .",
    "this result is similar to that found in the ngc 2244 cluster @xcite in which primordial disks are affected only in the immediate vicinity of the o stars ( @xmath40.5pc ) .",
    "our results reinforce an emerging trend in studies of disk frequency , specifically that optically thick disk dissipation is rapid for @xmath32% of systems , lasting less than 5 myr , while @xmath33% of disks can last for 8 myr or more .",
