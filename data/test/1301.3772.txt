    "numerical modeling of dynamic spacetimes containing black holes ( bhs ) in the framework of einstein s theory has been motivated for a large part of its nearly 50 year long history by the calculation of the gravitational wave ( gw ) signals generated by bh binary systems .",
    "these efforts culminated in 2005 in the first evolutions of bh binaries through inspiral , merger and ringdown@xcite . over the following years",
    ", numerical relativity ( nr ) simulations have been used in the construction of gw template banks @xcite fundamental for signal searches in gw detectors such as ligo , virgo and geo600 @xcite and have also been studied in the context of gw data analysis @xcite .",
    "ninja_@xcite and _ nrar_@xcite collaborations in particular combine the resources of various nr groups with the analytic relativity and gravitational - wave data analysis community .",
    "nr studies have furthermore provided valuable insight into a variety of astrophysical scenarios involving bhs as for example the study of gravitational recoil @xcite , jet phenomena @xcite and electromagnetic counterparts for multi - messenger astrophysics @xcite . for reviews of these subjects",
    "we refer to refs .  .",
    "in recent years , however , nr has also emerged as a valuable tool to explore high - energy physics scenarios @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the most recent developments in these areas which , for reasons of clarity , we divide into three categories : ( i ) numerical studies of fundamental properties of bh spacetimes , ( ii ) applications to the modeling of trans - planckian scattering and ( iii ) the gauge gravity duality .",
    "this division is not entirely rigorous and we will encounter scenarios of relevance for more than one of these major topics . for example the stability of rotating bhs in higher dimensions is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fundamental ] on fundamental properties of bhs but likely also affects the signature in the conjectured formation of mini bhs in trans - planckian scattering events .",
    "wherever present , we will emphasize such significance across our somewhat arbitrarily chosen distinction .",
    "nr studies in the context of high - energy physics and fundamental properties of classical general relativity frequently involve bhs in higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "in some cases , however , valuable insight can be inferred as well from the more traditional case of spacetimes with `` 3 + 1 '' dimensions ( three spatial and one time - like ) .",
    "somewhat in breach of its title , this work is therefore not entirely limited to the numerical investigation of higher - dimensional bhs . as complementary reading to this article ,",
    "we note review articles including nr applications in high - energy physics by pretorius@xcite , cardoso _",
    "et al._@xcite and yoshino & shibata@xcite . an extended discussion of bhs in higher dimensions is given in .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of the nr techniques in sec .",
    "[ sec : nr ] .",
    "the above mentioned main applications of nr to higher - dimensional bhs will be reviewed in secs .",
    "[ sec : fundamental ] , [ sec : transplanckian ] and [ sec : adscft ] . in each of these",
    "we will provide a brief motivation of the corresponding studies and list more specialized review articles for further reading .",
    "we will conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . unless noted otherwise , we use units such that the speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "formulations of the einstein equations suitable for nr can be classified into two main groups .",
    "the characteristic bondi - sachs@xcite formalism is based on the characteristic surfaces of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "this formalism leads to a natural hierarchy of the equations which reflects the isolation of the gravitational degrees of freedom ; in the four - dimensional case , for example , one obtains one trivial equation , three complementary equations , four hypersurface equations and two evolution equations for the degrees of freedom .",
    "a difficulty arising in the characteristic approach is the potential formation of caustics and the ensuing breakdown of the coordinate system . for the classical general - relativistic two - body problem , the inspiral and merger of two bhs ,",
    "a robust solution for this problem has not yet been found .",
    "nevertheless , characteristic methods have been employed with great success in various codes studying configurations with additional symmetries , most notably in the series of studies by chesler & yaffe@xcite on thermalization of quark - gluon plasmas through the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence .",
    "characteristic evolutions are reviewed in detail by winicour@xcite .",
    "the majority of work on the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries , including the 2005 breakthroughs , however , has been performed in 3 + 1 approaches . here",
    "spacetime is decomposed into a one - parameter family of three or , more generally , @xmath1 dimensional , spatial hypersurfaces . the canonical 3 + 1 split has been developed by arnowitt , deser and misner@xcite ( adm ) , reformulated by york@xcite and leads to a system of six second - order evolution equations for the induced spatial metric and four constraint equations , the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "introduction of the extrinsic curvature as an evolution variable converts the evolution equations into a first - order - in - time system . by performing a conformal rescaling of the spatial metric , a decomposition of the extrinsic curvature into trace and a trace - free part and evolving the contracted christoffel symbol as separate fields , baumgarte , shapiro , shibata and",
    "nakamura@xcite have developed a strongly hyperbolic formulation@xcite commonly referred to as `` bssn '' which has been used with great success by many numerical groups .",
    "the adm / bssn approach to numerical relativity is discussed in great detail in .",
    "an alternative cauchy - type formulation has been derived from the einstein equations in harmonic gauge where they take on a manifestly hyperbolic form .",
    "the harmonic gauge can be generalized to arbitrary gauge choices by introducing source functions for the coordinate conditions @xcite .",
    "more details of this _ generalized harmonic gauge _ ( ghg ) formulation can be found in .",
    "the ghg and bssn methods have been the foundation of the numerical relativity breakthroughs of 2005 by pretorius@xcite and the brownsville and goddard groups@xcite .",
    "nr applications in higher - dimensional spacetimes have so far been restricted to configurations with symmetry assumptions .",
    "this is largely a consequence of the vast increase in computational resources required by each additional dimension .",
    "a reduction of higher - dimensional general relativity to an effective 3 + 1 or lower - dimensional computational domain has been achieved in various ways .",
    "the most evident approach is to directly impose the symmetry together with the coordinate conditions on the line element .",
    "for example , sorkin & oren@xcite describe the @xmath2-dimensional , spherically symmetric spacetime in double - null coordinates @xmath3 by the line element @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric on a @xmath6 dimensional unit hyper sphere and @xmath7 is the areal radius . the time evolution is then determined by the einstein equations derived from this metric ; see their eqs .",
    "( 3)-(6 ) .",
    "alternatively , a general procedure for a dimensional reduction under the assumption of one or more killing vectors is given by geroch@xcite . by using this procedure",
    ", the @xmath2-dimensional einstein equations with @xmath8 symmetries can be converted to an effective 3 + 1 scheme coupled to scalar or vector fields which represent the curvature of the extra - dimensions@xcite .",
    "such a dimensional reduction is particularly attractive because it provides a straightforward way to apply the successful numerical techniques developed in 3 + 1 with relatively minor modifications to the study of higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "a different way to achieve the same goal is based on the _ cartoon method_@xcite which employs interpolation of grid functions and/or trading of spatial derivatives to evolve symmetric spacetimes on a reduced cartesian grid .",
    "this approach has been modified and extended to higher - dimensional applications by pretorius@xcite and yoshino & shibata@xcite and has proven a rather robust tool to study bh collisions and instabilities .",
    "the generation of initial data in higher - dimensional spacetimes relies to a significant extent on similar techniques developed for the 3 + 1 case ; see cooks@xcite review .",
    "in particular , it has been shown by yoshino _",
    "et al._@xcite that the existence of analytic solutions of bowen - york@xcite type for the momentum constraints carries over to general relativity in @xmath2 dimensions . solving the hamiltonian constraint for the conformal factor",
    "can then be achieved by numerical methods similar to those developed for 3 + 1 dimensions . by using this procedure , initial data for bh binaries with boost",
    "have been obtained in refs .  .",
    "for specific numerical studies , analytic initial data is available in closed form , as for example the @xmath2 dimensional generalization of brill - lindquist@xcite data describing a bh binary at the moment of time symmetry .",
    "analytic bh solutions can also be employed to construct approximate solutions to the einstein constraints by superposition of either the solutions themselves or boosted variants thereof .    for more details on the numerical methods , the construction of initial data and gauge choices , we refer the reader to the publications reviewed in the following sections .",
    "bhs play a central role in the applications of nr to higher - dimensional spacetimes discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : transplanckian ] and [ sec : adscft ] . quite aside from these applications , bhs provide a unique probe for deepening our insight into the gravitational theory and understanding in which regards 3 + 1 dimensions represent a special case .",

    "emparan & reall@xcite .",
    "asymptotically flat , stationary solutions of the einstein equations in vacuum in 3 + 1 dimensions belong to the kerr family and describe single bhs of spherical topology characterized by two parameters , the mass @xmath9 and angular momentum parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the stability of these solutions has been studied extensively ; see for example refs .   and dafermos@xcite review .",
    "such classical bh solutions are expected to be stable in the region outside the horizon , but admit instabilities in the interior@xcite .",
    "penrose s _ cosmic censorship_@xcite furthermore conjectures that collapse of ordinary matter does not lead to the formation of naked singularities ; instead such singularities are hidden from outside view through an event horizon .",
    "bhs in higher dimensions are solutions to the @xmath2-dimensional einstein equations ] @xmath11 for the vacuum case @xmath12 .",
    "solutions to these equations can be generated straightforwardly from extending the four - dimensional schwarzschild metric with one or more flat dimensions .",
    "these _ black strings _ or _",
    "black branes _ are susceptible to the gregory - laflamme@xcite ( gl ) instability related to the vastly different length scales in the horizon geometry .",
    "these solutions furthermore suggest a modification of thornes@xcite hoop conjecture ; if an amount @xmath9 of mass - energy is compressed into a volume such that its circumference is below its schwarzschild radius in every direction , a bh forms .",
    "the existence of black branes indicates that such a concentration of energy is sufficient in a subset of the spatial directions .",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional generalization of the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution is given by the tangherlini@xcite metric @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 determines the bh mass @xmath15 .",
    "here , @xmath16 denotes the surface area of the @xmath6 dimensional unit hypersphere .",
    "note that mass is now of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "schwarzschild solutions in @xmath2 dimensions have been found to be stable against linearized gravitational perturbations@xcite .",
    "in contrast to their spherically symmetric counterparts , the class of rotating bh solutions exhibits a vastly richer structure in higher dimensions .",
    "first , rotation is now possible in more than one plane , giving rise to more than one rotation parameter .",
    "second , the radial dependence of the newtonian potential is altered to @xmath18 whereas the centrifugal potential maintains its @xmath19 character .",
    "this @xmath2-dependent character of the newtonian potential manifests itself in the absence of stable circular geodesics for @xmath20@xcite .",

    "bhs rotating in one plane with rotation parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively represent naked singularities . in @xmath25 ,",
    "in contrast , there exists a horizon for all values of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of infinite rotation rate , this horizon becomes increasingly flattened along the rotation plane@xcite and is therefore expected to be gl unstable .",
    "this has been confirmed in linearized studies by dias _",
    "et al._@xcite . in the case of rotations in more than one plane ,",
    "the existence of horizons in ultra - spinning bh spacetimes requires at least two ( one ) spin parameter to vanish for an odd ( even ) number of dimensions @xmath2 .",

    ", however , the ads boundary substantially modifies the outcome .",
    "in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes , spatial infinity in ads is reached in finite time by massless fields and reflected back onto the origin . as the initial amplitude is reduced below a critical value @xmath46 , the scalar pulse forms a bh upon its second implosion on the origin",

    "et al._@xcite suggesting that ads is unstable to bh formation for generic spacetime dimensions .",

    "the same type of instability to bh formation has been found by maliborski @xcite for a minkowski spacetime enclosed inside a reflecting wall , indicating that the global structure plays a major role for the effect .",
    "perturbative studies support the numerically observed instability of ads @xcite , but the question of the generic stability properties of _ asymptotically _ ads spacetimes , as for example those containing bhs or boson stars , remains under study @xcite .",
    "the instability of black strings has been studied numerically in a sequence of papers by lehner & pretorius and collaborators@xcite , see also .",
    "it had been known since the 1990s that black strings are subject to the gl instability , but the eventual fate of the string remained unclear . in ref .  , lehner & pretorius found evidence supporting indications by earlier work that the string evolves to a sequence of spherical bhs connected by thin string segments which themselves are subject to the gl instability , resulting in a self - similar cascade reaching zero string width in finite asymptotic time .",
    "this behaviour shows striking similarity with satellite formation in the flow of low - viscosity fluids .",
    "the eventual bifurcation of the horizon resulting from the cascade implies formation of a naked singularity@xcite .",
    "because no finetuning is required to trigger the instability , the result constitutes a violation of the cosmic censorship conjecture without `` unnatural '' assumptions about the initial data .",

    "they observe bhs spinning above a threshold dimensionless spin - parameter @xmath50 to spontaneously emit gravitational waves and settle down into a subcritical configuration . expressed in terms of the ratio of polar to equatorial circumference @xmath51 of the apparent horizon",

    "in contrast , they obtain a significantly stronger distortion threshold @xmath58 in @xmath22 indicating a somewhat special status of @xmath22 ; we recall in this context the absence of an upper limit on the spin in @xmath25 .",
    "bhs spinning below the critical rate , on the other hand , show no signs of instability in any of their simulations . the effect of this instability on the evaporation of bhs conjectured to be produced in trans - planckian scattering ( cf .",
    "[ sec : transplanckian ] ) depends on the timescale of the instability and , hence , on the spin parameter of the formed bh ; for details see the discussion in sec .",
    "vi d in ref .  .    even though this review is primarily concerned with time evolutions",
    ", we note that numerical techniques are also applied for finding static and stationary solutions to the @xmath2 dimensional einstein equations in vacuum , as for example the construction of four - dimensional rotating bh solutions in a cavity@xcite or asymptotically ads spacetimes in @xmath22 with a conformally schwarzschild boundary @xcite .",
    "this topic is reviewed in detail by wiseman@xcite .",
    "the standard model of particle physics provides an exceptionally successful description of subatomic particles and their interactions via the electromagnetic , weak and strong forces . in spite of its success ,",
    "however , there remain important unanswered questions , as for example the unknown nature of dark matter . in the context of this section ,",
    "the most important open issue is the large discrepancy between the electroweak energy scale @xmath59 and the grand unification scale @xmath60 .",
    "this so - called _ hierarchy problem _ manifests itself in the extraordinary weakness of the gravitational interaction relative to the other fundamental forces ; the weak interaction is about 32 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational one . at energies comparable to the grand unification energy , on the other hand",
    ", gravity is expected to become comparable in strength to the other interactions .    a particularly intriguing solution to the hierarchy problem is the _ add _ model @xcite , which proposes large ( relative to the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath61 ) extra dimensions of radius @xmath62 such that the fundamental planck scale @xmath63 may be as low as @xmath64 . consider for illustration the poisson equation in @xmath1 spatial dimensions for a point source @xmath65 , with the @xmath2 dimensional gravitational constant @xmath66 and the source mass @xmath9 . from gauss s law",
    "we obtain in spherical coordinates @xmath67 at large distances @xmath68 , the extra dimensions are not accessible to the gravitational field and merely contribute an overall volume factor such that @xmath69 whereas for @xmath70 , the potential is determined by the @xmath1 dimensional poisson equation . ignoring geometrical factors of order @xmath71 , we thus obtain @xmath72 at large distances we thus recover the usual @xmath73 potential with a four - dimensional coupling constant @xmath74 which implies for the energy scales @xmath75 . for example , a fundamental planck mass @xmath63 of the order of the electroweak scale requires @xmath76 in @xmath22 ( ruled out experimentally ) or @xmath77 for @xmath55 . in a different version of the model proposed by randall & sundrum@xcite , a finite length scale is introduced through a warp factor into otherwise infinite extra dimensions .    an intriguing consequence of an effective planck mass much below its four - dimensional value @xmath60 is the possibility of bh formation in parton - parton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite ; see also the reviews by cavagli @xcite and kanti @xcite .",
    "once formed , such mini bhs are expected to evaporate in four stages @xcite : ( i ) a balding phase during which the bh sheds all multipoles except for mass , spin and charge , ( ii ) a spin - down and ( iii ) a schwarzschild phase during which the bh looses first its spin and then its mass via semi - classical hawking radiation and ( iv ) the planck regime as the bh mass approaches the planck mass which is described by an as yet unknown theory of quantum gravity .    of particular interest in the context of nr is the fact that the first three of these phases should be well described by classical and semi - classical calculations provided the bh mass exceeds the planck scale by at least a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "if we further assume that most of the energy of the collision process resides in the kinetic energy of the particles , such that their internal structure becomes negligible , the dynamics of the collision should be well modeled by two point particles or bhs in @xmath2-dimensional general relativity @xcite . testing this assumption forms one of the main motivations for nr applications and we shall return to this question shortly .",
    "bh formation is expected to manifest itself in collision experiments by a special signature in its decay products as for example the jet multiplicity or transverse energy @xcite . for the identification of these signatures , theoretical predictions from monte - carlo event generators such as blackmax @xcite and charybdis @xcite",
    "are compared with experimental data .",
    "key input parameters for the event generators are the scattering cross section for bh formation and the initial mass and spin distributions of the formed holes . providing this",

    "it thus appears unlikely that the most optimistic tev - gravity models with @xmath80 are those realized in nature .    in summary ,",
    "the main questions to be addressed by nr simulations are ( i ) the validity of the hoop conjecture in highly dynamical configurations , ( ii ) the scattering threshold for bh formation , ( iii ) the mass and spin parameters of the formed bhs and ( iv ) the impact of the colliding objects structure on the dynamics .",
    "high - energy collisions in the framework of general relativity are currently best understood in @xmath21 dimensions , largely because the numerical infrastructure for this setting is most advanced and robust .",
    "even though generalization of the results to arbitrary spacetime dimensionality will ultimately be essential , a great deal of insight can be and has already been obtained in the four - dimensional case .",
    "we shall review these results before plunging into the latest developments on collisions for arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "the expectation of bh formation in high - energy collisions dominated by gravitational interaction is closely tied to thorne s hoop conjecture @xcite . applied to head - on collisions with boost factor @xmath44 , we expect two objects , each of rest mass @xmath81 and size @xmath82 , to form a bh if the schwarzschild radius @xmath83 associated with @xmath9 satisfies @xmath84 , i.  e.  @xmath85 .",
