    "cooling microscopic , mesoscopic , and macroscopic objects to their motional ground states has attracted great attention in the past decades .",
    "various atoms , ions and molecules have been cooled and trapped , and some of them have been employed in quantum information processing and atomic clocks .",
    "it is of fundamental interests to cool macroscopic objects down to quantum regime for studying quantum effects in macroscopic systems , improving precisions in ultra - sensitive measurements @xcite , and realizing quantum information processing with new ideas @xcite .",
    "cooling mechanical oscillators near the ground state can be accomplished by placing the high frequency oscillator in cryogenic environment @xcite , or optomechanical cavity cooling methods @xcite , or combining them together @xcite .",
    "recent report has shown the possibility to cool a mesoscopic microwave - frequency mechanical oscillator down to the motional ground state by standard cryogenic methods @xcite . however , the mechanical q factor ( around 260 ) in this system @xcite is too small for many applications .",
    "similar to optical trapping and cooling of atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite , a nanosphere can be optically trapped and cooled in a cavity @xcite .",
    "an optically trapped nanosphere in vacuum is well isolated from the thermal environment and can have a mechanical q factor larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this approach has the potential to cool a mechanical system to the vibrational ground state even at room temperature , based on which nonclassical states(e.g . squeezed states ) could be generated .",
    "a cooled nanosphere can also be used to test gravity induced decoherence effects @xcite and search for non - newtonian gravity forces @xcite .",
    "we noticed that the first part of the proposal @xcite , which is trapping micro(nano)-sphere by optical tweezer with high frequency , has been realized experimentally @xcite , in which a glass microsphere was optically trapped in air and vacuum , and its brownian motion was measured with ultrahigh precision . a more exciting work would be to cool a nanosphere to the quantum ground state using sideband cooling with the help of cavities @xcite , and observe the individual collisions between the sphere and single molecules @xcite .",
    "a nanosphere will scatter the cooling laser to all three dimensions and cause 3d heating .",
    "the heating effects of laser noises are also 3d .",
    "as will be discussed later , such heating can cause exponential growth of the kinetic energy of a nanosphere .",
    "if only one - dimensional motion is cooled efficiently , the others will be heated up continuously and the nanosphere will be kicked out of the trap . in order to achieve ground state cooling of an optically trapped nanosphere , we must use a 3d cooling scheme . we can straightforwardly add two more cavities for cooling the other two dimensions , but",
    "the system will become too complex to be realized .",
    "we may combine the 1d cavity cooling with 2d feedback cooling to stabilized the system .",
    "but the system will also become complex and can only do ground state cooling in 1d .    in this work ,",
    "we propose to cool and measure the 3d motion of a nanosphere by tem00 , tem01 , and tem10 modes of a single cavity .",
    "we show that each one of these three modes can be coupled to the motion of a trapped nanosphere in each dimension respectively .",
    "thus they can be used to cool and detect the 3d motion of a nanosphere .",
    "the scheme can be used for detecting the individual collisions between molecules and the nanosphere .",
    "the mass of the molecules , and the surface temperature of the nanosphere may also be measured at the same time .",
    "we noticed trapping single atoms in a high - finesse cavity driven by three lasers at tem00 , tem01 , and tem10 modes simultaneously has been realized in an experiment @xcite .",
    "one can also use a phase plate to generate a tem01 ( or tem10 ) beam from a tem00 beam @xcite , and use it to pump the corresponding mode of a cavity .",
    "our scheme should also helpful for cavity cooling of atoms ( ions ) and molecules .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3d ] , we introduce the scheme of nanosphere 3d cooling via a cavity . in sec . [",
    "sec : detecting ] , we propose the scheme of detecting the collisions between molecules and the sphere , and discuss the experimental possibility . in sec .",
    "[ sec : c ] , we give a short summary of the paper .",
    "as shown in fig . 1a , we consider an optically trapped nanosphere with mass @xmath1 confined in a cavity by means of an optical tweezer @xcite . since the mechanical q of the system could be extremely high , e.g. , @xmath2 @xcite , we may consider an ideal system in the first part of our treatment , but leave the effect from the environment , such as the collisions between molecule and nanosphere , to later discussion .",
    "the frequencies of the optical trap along the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 axes are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "contrary to the conventional method of using a cooling laser with tem00 mode to cool the motion along @xmath3 direction , we add two non - gaussian beams with tem01 and tem10 modes to drive the cavity in order to cool the motion along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions , respectively .",
    "the resonant frequencies of the cavity modes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the detunings between the lasers and the cavity modes are @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "we suppose that the tem01 and tem10 lasers have the same frequency , but with orthogonal polarization .",
    "the tem00 and tem01 lasers have the same polarization , but different frequencies . in practical , the frequency differences between tem00 and tem01 ( tem10 )",
    "could be very large , and the tem01 and tem10 modes are orthogonal in polarizations .",
    "therefore the interference between the three cavity modes can be neglected .",
    "supposing the radius of the nanosphere to be much smaller than the wavelength of the cavity mode , we may calculate the sphere - induced cavity frequency shift @xmath17 by perturbation theory , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the resonant frequency of a cavity without the nanosphere , @xmath20 is the cavity mode profile and @xmath21 is the variation in permittivity induced by the nanosphere .",
    "due to the tiny scale of the nanosphere , we have @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the center - of - mass position of the nanosphere , @xmath24 the polarizability , and @xmath25 the sphere volume .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system in the rotating frame is @xmath26 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 characterizes the phonon mode along @xmath28 direction with @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the driving strength by the lasers and @xmath31 characterizes the coupling between the cavity mode @xmath32 and the nanosphere . in the limit that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electric permittivity of the nanosphere , we get @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we assume the optical tweezer to be much stronger than the cavity - mode - induced trap , and neglect the effects of cooling lights on trapping . besides , if we carefully choose the location of the trap , such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , the gradients of the three light fields lie approximately along the three axes .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath42 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 characterizes the coupling strength between the cavity mode and the oscillation of the nanosphere , and @xmath44 is zero - point fluctuation for the phonon mode @xmath27 . in general , @xmath45 can be one to two orders larger than @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is deduced with linearization , which is valid when the vibration amplitude of a trapped nanosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of the laser .",
    "the rms vibration amplitude of a particle in a harmonic trap is @xmath48 . for a nanosphere with radius of @xmath49 nm trapped in an optical tweezer with trapping frequency of @xmath50 mhz ,",
    "the vibration amplitude is @xmath51 nm at @xmath52 k , and will be only @xmath53 nm at @xmath54k , which are very small",
    ". thus the linearization will be valid if the nanosphere is pre - cooled by feedback cooling .    from eq .",
    ", the linearized heisenberg equations of motion for our system are , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the decay rate of the cavity mode @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath59 is the amplitude of cavity mode @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath60 is the effective detuning between the driving laser and the cavity mode @xmath32 .",
    "the linearization of the heisenberg equations is valid only if the state is stable .",
    "the stable criteria is @xcite @xmath61 because of @xmath62 , the criteria @xmath63 are always valid .",
    "the criteria @xmath64 are valid only when @xmath65 . in the following discussion , we suppose that the stable criteria is satisfied .    to realize resolved sideband cooling , we require @xmath66 . we suppose @xmath67 , and find that the final phonon number is @xcite @xmath68 in the special case of @xmath69 , the final phonon number is @xmath70 .",
    "the cooling rate is @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the scheme can measure the 3d motion of the nanosphere at the same time .",
    "we have a reduced equation under rotating wave approximation , in the case of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , as @xcite , @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 , using boundary condition @xmath76 , we get @xmath77 , @xmath78",
    ". therefore the 3d motion of the nanosphere can be measured by detecting the output fields . in the resolved sideband limit ,",
    "the output field is nearly vacuum , and will have a signal when there are collisions between the residual molecules in vacuum and the nanosphere .",
    "besides , the shot noise can also be neglected in the scheme as it is very small ( estimated to be around @xmath79 hz in ref @xcite ) .    because a collision between a molecule and a nanosphere is 3d in nature , our 3d scheme will be essential for efficient detecting of the collisions .",
    "detection of individual collisions between single molecules and the nanosphere would lead to a test of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution on single - collision level . considering the gas pressure @xmath80 at temperature @xmath81 , the radius of the sphere @xmath82 , the molecule mass @xmath83",
    ", we have the collision number per second @xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath85 is the boltzmann constant . the collision time is estimated to be much less than the nanosphere oscillation time scale .",
    "the three phonon modes initially in vacuum will be in a state with mean phonon number @xmath86 : @xmath87 after a single collision , where @xmath88 is the time when collision happens .",
    "for this case , the output field is @xmath89a_j(t_0 ) + a_{cj}^{\\mathrm{in}},\\ ] ] it is easy to find that @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that the output - pulse photon number is equal to the increase of the phonon number after the collision . from above discussion",
    ", we get the phonon decay time @xmath91 , which is also the pulse duration of the output light of mode @xmath32 .",
    "the phonon number can be measured by detecting the output light pulse .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 is the measurement time for the phonon mode @xmath27 after the collision .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath93 , the collision events can be measured individually .    moreover , to make sure the success of the output field detection , the phonon number after the collision requires to be added by more than one .",
    "for the first case , we suppose the collision is completely elastic .",
    "parts of the molecular movement , which is perpendicular to the surface of the collision point , will change in direction after the collision @xcite .",
    "the average increase of the phonon number for @xmath27 is @xmath94 with @xmath95 the the mean velocity square along the axis @xmath28 . as a result ,",
    "the requirement for the phonon number change could be rewritten as @xmath96 .",
    "if the collision is completely inelastic , the molecule will attach on the surface of the nanosphere for a while before being kicked out @xcite .",
    "the output velocity distribution is completely determined by the temperature of the nanosphere surface .",
    "the criteria should be either @xmath97 , or @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the temperature of the surface of the nanosphere . to distinguish elastic and inelastic collision , we can cool the temperature to the limit that @xmath100 , and makes the condition @xmath98 fulfills by adding a long wavelength laser to heat the sphere .",
    "if the collisions are all elastic , there is no signal on the photon detectors .",
    "if there are parts of the collisions are inelastic , there are output pulses of lights . besides , the distribution of the photon numbers is determined by the surface temperature of the sphere . in other words",
    ", we can measure the surface temperature of the nanosphere by detecting the output light pulses . besides",
    ", if there are more than one type of molecules involved , we can also distinguish them by the measurement .",
    "we suppose that the energy increasing of the phonon mode @xmath27 after collision fulfills the maxwell - boltzmann distribution and the collisions are elastic .",
    "the mean phonon increasing for mode @xmath27 is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the effective temperature of mode @xmath27 after single collisions .",
    "the phonon adding distribution after single collisions for mode @xmath27 is @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "however , the mean phonon adding can not be measured from a single light pulse . as the photon detector can only measure the photon pulses number in integer .",
    "the measured number distribution of the mode @xmath27 should be bose - einstein distribution , which is @xmath104 @xcite . we suppose the mass @xmath105 and @xmath106 corresponding to the molecules @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , and the same mean kinetic energies for both types of the molecules .",
    "the average increase of the phonon number for the phonon modes @xmath27 is different for different collision . as shown in fig .",
    "2a , there are two curves in the phonons distribution of mode @xmath109 , which represent the two different molecules .",
    "2b shows the measured phonon distribution for different molecules . we can distinguish the different molecules from data fitting .    specifically , we consider the example below .",
    "we consider a sphere with radius @xmath110 nm and mass @xmath111 kg ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the optical tweezer is consturcted with a laser with power @xmath113mw at wavelength @xmath114 nm , and a lense of numerical aperture @xmath115 .",
    "the trap frequency is @xmath116 mhz @xcite .",
    "we consider the cavity with length @xmath117 mm , mode waist @xmath118 m and wavelength @xmath119 m . in the case of @xmath33",
    ", we have @xmath120 hz , @xmath121 hz , and the zero point fluctuation @xmath122 m. in order to have the final phonon number @xmath123 , the finesse of the cavity should be around @xmath124 . for",
    "@xmath125 kg and the gas pressure @xmath126torr , the collision events per second are about @xmath127 .",
    "if we suppose the cavity decay rate to be @xmath128 mhz , corresponding to finesse @xmath129 , with proper driving strength ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) , the cooling rate for all three modes would be @xmath133hz and the mean addition of the phonon number for @xmath27 after each collision is around @xmath134 .",
    "therefore individual measurements for the collision events can be distinguished for the three phonon modes . the cooling laser power for cavity mode",
    "@xmath9 is in the order of @xmath135w , the laser powers for cavity modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in the order of @xmath136w .     after a elastic collision between the nanosphere and a molecule with mass @xmath137 kg or @xmath138 kg . the temperature of the gas is @xmath52k.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]   after a elastic collision between the nanosphere and a molecule with mass @xmath137 kg or @xmath138 kg . the temperature of the gas is @xmath52k.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]",
    "so far we havent considered the systematic noise effects in our treatment . in real experiments , however , the noise from lasers may be fatal to the success of an experiment .",
    "we first consider the heating effects from the optical trap @xcite .",
    "if we want to realize motional ground state cooling of the nanosphere , the heating rate should be much smaller than the laser cooling rate .",
    "strictly speaking , the heating comes from the laser intensity fluctuation and the laser - beam - pointing noise .",
    "for the former , we define the fluctuations of the laser @xmath139 , with @xmath140 the average intensity and @xmath141 the laser intensity at time @xmath142 . by using first - order time - dependent perturbation theory",
    ", we get @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the heating constant is @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the one - sided power spectrum of the fractional intensity noise , which could be on the order of @xmath146 . for the trap frequency of mhz",
    ", @xmath147 approaches the order of @xmath148hz .",
    "the laser - beam - pointing noise is originated from the fluctuation relevant to the location of the trap center , which is independent of the phonon energy .",
    "similarly , we may get @xmath149 where @xmath150 , and @xmath151 is the noise spectrum of location fluctuations .",
    "we define the heating rate as @xmath152 , which represents phonon number increase per second .",
    "if we set @xmath153 to be on the order of @xmath148hz , we should make sure that @xmath154 is around @xmath155hz for @xmath156mhz .",
    "experimentally @xmath151 has been controlled less than @xmath157 hz for @xmath158 khz @xcite . with the increase of the optical trap frequency to large detuning from the system",
    "s resonant frequency , @xmath159 is dropping down quickly .",
    "therefore , we believe that the laser - beam - pointing noise could be well controlled and the heating rate @xmath153 would be less than @xmath160 hz .    the phase noise induced by the cooling laser also need to be seriously considered @xcite . because the cooling laser is of finite linewidth , the laser field can be wrote down as @xmath161 .",
    "we assume the phase noise @xmath162 to be gaussian and with zero mean value .",
    "for the lorentzian noise spectrum with @xmath163 , and correlation function @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the linewidth of the laser and @xmath166 is the correlation time of the laser phase noise , the phonon number limited by this noise is @xmath167 @xcite . if we choose @xmath168 khz , @xmath169 khz , @xmath170 hz , and @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 . in this sense , like above discussed noise effects , the phase noise effect can also be neglected .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme to cool and measure the 3d motion of an optically trapped nanosphere confined in a single cavity , driven by three lasers . with properly locating the optical trap and the laser detunings , we have shown by calculation that the 3d motion of the nanosphere could be cooled and detected simultaneously , and down to ground states if the sideband resolved condition is fulfilled .",
    "we have justified the experimental feasibility of our scheme under currently available technology .",
    "we argue that our scheme would be useful for not only checking the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at single - collision level , but also measuring the temperature of the surface of the nanosphere and the mass of the molecule .",
    "the work is supported by nnsfc under grant no .",

    "tl would like to thank m. g. raizen for helpful discussions and the suggestion of using a cooled bead to detect single molecules ."
