    "the impressive development of low - dimensional electronic and optoelectronic devices , brought a new urgency to the essential measurement and modeling of charge carriers transmission time and particularly of the tunneling time through specific potential regions . when electrons and holes are involved , the low - dimensional device response depends on the slower charge - carrier s traveling time @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , for such systems it is crucial to study the tunneling time of holes .",
    "an equally important reason for address investigations on heavy holes @xmath2 and light holes @xmath3 , is their intrinsic band mixing effects . since the hole s transport is essentially an interconnected - multichannel process , the theoretical calculation of transmission quantities is in some sense more cumbersome than that for electrons .    currently , the research of under - synchronic anomalous scattering events , is one of the major areas in the quantum transport theory@xcite .",
    "regarding the long - standing controversy around superluminal velocities and total transmission inconsistency , together with their wide - known anomalous character @xcite , they are welcome due to all possible benefits they open up for design and development of nano - optoelectronic devices@xcite .",
    "there is a large accumulated knowledge about these topics -mostly dedicated to electrons , optical pulses and electromagnetic waves @xcite- , accurately enough to unambiguously provide solid grounds for superluminal propagation , the paradoxical hartman premonition and legitimacy of the phase time approach .",
    "worthwhile noticing however that , hole transport analogous phenomena has been less studied yet .",
    "resonant mechanisms between propagating modes oscillations and the self oscillations of the system are the fundamental cause , which gives rise to an isolated maximums of transmission , often referred to as giant conductance ( gg ) phenomena",
    ". events of gg have been observed for electrons and optical pulses in many finite periodic systems , which possess time reversal symmetry , namely : ballistic mesoscopic conductors , luminal pulses and superlattices @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies in molecular devices suggested that could rise up particularly large values for dynamic conductance @xcite and novel experimental achievements pointed out to a giant enhancement of electronic tunneling in a two - dimensional lattice of graphene@xcite .",
    "lately , was found a strong dependence of the conductance fluctuations with the density of states in graphene nanoribbons , which represent an alternative insight to study the band structure of these physical systems@xcite .",
    "owing to its relevance for quantum transport , the tunneling time has played a key role for a correct evaluation of electronic devices @xcite .",
    "a large number of proposals in reply the challenge to settle how long does it takes to a particle to tunnel a single potential barrier @xcite , have been put forward @xcite .",
    "the lively and long standing debate concerning this matter @xcite -presumed not to finish completely- , it seems to have finally found its cornerstone in precise experimental measurements for photons and optical pulses @xcite .",
    "these genuine measurements put to the test , before all else , the very question loosely formulated by mccoll and directly bear on truly temporal features of tunneling phenomenon . besides , they are consistent with the phase time conception derived from group delay within the stationary - phase method @xcite . an additional motivation was the accurate description of above mentioned experiments by careful phase - time calculations @xcite .    in this paper we will present numerical calculations of the conductance and the phase time for an arbitrary number of alternate layers of @xmath4 materials , in the framework of the multicomponent scattering approach ( msa)@xcite . the main idea is to search evidences of anomalous events in @xmath5 and @xmath6 transmission . in sec.[msa ] some theoretical remarks within the msa are exposed . brief complementary insights to the uncoupled regime formula of scattering matrix unitarity relations and phase time will also be presented .",
    "analytical expressions for the phase time and the conductance are applied in sec.[numericalresults ] to study the anomalous events associated with these physical quantities in the double barrier resonant tunneling ( dbrt ) and the superlattice .",
    "phase time behavior for holes shows a very good agreement with the previous results for electron - tunneling through superlattices@xcite .",
    "evidences of the giant conductance phenomena for uncoupled hole transport are shown .",
    "finally , in sec.[conclusions ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the msa is based on standard @xmath7 effective hamiltonians and the multichannel transfer matrix ( tm ) method . in this approach",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be obtained straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "the main purpose here , is to evaluate quantities of synchronic multi - mode transport for massive charge carriers moving through multi - layered structures at coupled and decoupled channel regimes .",
    "owing to consistency , we found useful to recall few basic outlines of the kohn - lttinger ( kl ) two - band model @xcite , due to its widely accepted accuracy for describing dynamics of elementary excitations as well as electronic properties in the valence band , within the framework of the multiband effective mass approach .",
    "this model , is highly common regarding to the field of hole quantum transport through periodic heterostructures .",
    "it considers in the @xmath8 approximation the highest two valence bands degenerated in the @xmath9-point of the brillouin zone .",
    "the usual @xmath10 kl hamiltonian @xcite in the broido - sham representation @xcite , has the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 being @xmath13 in atomic units .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath14 show a direct dependency of the semi - empirical parameters of lttinger @xmath15 , that typify each slab of the heterostructure . while @xmath16 and @xmath17 , stand for the periodic potential , and the two - components in - plane _",

    ", we consider the system shown in fig.([fig : heterostructure ] ) , described by the kohn - lttinger hamiltonian in the expression ( [ 4x4hkl ] ) .",
    "the four accessible channels of the system , denoted as : @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , are considered simultaneously , following one of the bare bones of the msa .",
    "we emphasize this upmost advantage , as it allows clearly identify inter- and intra - subband hole transitions together with transitions from kramer - up toward kramer - down states to time reversal , and the other way around .",
    "the latter is not the usual case . in this approach , the segment between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in fig .",

    "this crucial transformation of the msa , connects two different kinds of tm .",
    "the first class of tm , @xmath27 , relates the linearly independent state functions and their derivatives ( @xmath28 ) between two points of the heterostructure in the form @xmath29 , where the matrix @xmath30 can be constructed once the linearly independent solutions are obtained  @xcite .",
    "the second kind of tm , @xmath31 , whose elements describe a propagating or evanescent mode depending on the energy , connects the state vectors ( @xmath32 ) in two different points of the system .",
    "the mathematical structure of these two matrices is conditioned by requirements of time - reversal invariance and flux conservation @xcite .",
    "a very strong criterium to verify the calculations is based in the determinant of these transfer matrices which must be constant and equal to the unity , mostly .    then applying the well known relations between the @xmath33 , and the scattering matrix + @xmath34 blocks @xcite",
    ", one can directly evaluate the relevant physical quantities of the scattered transport theory .",
    "initially we have to obtain the complex transmission amplitudes @xcite @xmath35 for each transition from the @xmath36-_th _ incoming channel ( incident propagating mode ) to the @xmath37-_th _ outgoing channel ( transmitted or reflected propagating modes ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that within the msa , none of the incoming amplitudes is required to cancel , as it is commonly done .",
    "hence , an authentic multichannel and synchronic description of the hole transmission processes is naturally achieved .",
    "this is to say that , we are able to distinguish accurately the contribution from each input channel to the scattering process , modulated by the simultaneous presence of the rest of the channels , which are , in principle , equally accessible to the incident hole stream .",
    "none of the usual simplifications of the original hamiltonians are invoked , thus the time reversal symmetry is assured . given",
    "the transmission amplitudes @xmath38 , it is possible to evaluate the total transmission probability to channel @xmath37 @xmath39 the total two - probe landauer conductance defined as  @xcite @xmath40 and the transmission amplitude phase for each of the @xmath41 available paths @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 . the transmission phase time is obtained from @xcite @xmath44 whose advantages and applicability criteria has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the sums in equations ( [ gi ] ) and ( [ gt ] ) run over all the open channels and the expressions ( [ gi])-([phase_time ] ) and ( [ phase_time_prop ] ) are defined for the @xmath45 cells periodic structure showed in fig.([fig : heterostructure ] ) .",
    "hereafter @xmath46 stands for the incoming particle s energy .",
    "tunable parameter @xmath17 , is essential to modify the in - plane dynamics of holes , _",
    "i.e. _ the degree of freedom transverse to the main transport direction , also refereed as the valence - band mixing for holes .",
    "this later is crucially relevant in order to understand the main problem envisioned here , and how we face it within the msa .",
    "whenever the _ quasi_-momentum parallel to the interfaces , @xmath47 , the crossed transitions are not allowed and the system is said to yield an uncoupled hole regime . under this particular condition , only direct incoming - outgoing channels are connected , therefore @xmath48 blocks @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the tm @xmath53 are diagonal matrices .",
    "the later , straightforwardly leads us to new unitarity relationships , that satisfy the blocks of the multiband scattering matrix under an uncoupled hole regime , acquiring a more simple form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , transmission and reflection amplitudes have reduced expressions respect to ( [ transmission_amplitudes ] ) : @xmath56 rewriting the phase time ( [ phase_time ] ) for this specific case , we obtain : @xmath57 expressions like ( [ transmission_reflection_amp ] ) were previously reported for the resonant tunneling and band mixing in multichannel superlattices of propagating electron systems @xcite .",

    "the phase time for @xmath5 and @xmath6 is also of the order of @xmath83 , which is in an acceptable qualitative agreement with experiment and it is just one order less than the traveling time for electrons through a single barrier @xcite , as was detected experimentally for a dbrt @xcite .",

    "these oscillations correspond to the quasi - stationary levels of the virtual qw with increasing width . in that sense , from @xmath64 properties we are able to forecast a longer lifetime for the lower unbound hole levels . on general grounds",

    "we also have observed , although will not be shown here , local increments of transmission coefficients in the energy vicinity , where negative dips appeared , though regretfully they need more investigation to derive proper conclusions .",

    "<S> events of giant conductance and anomalies of the phase transmission time for holes , are theoretically investigated within the multicomponent scattering approach . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model , new analytical expressions for unitarity relations in the uncoupled hole transport are obtained and directly applied to study the behavior of the conductance and the phase transmission time in a double barrier resonant tunneling ( dbrt ) and a superlattice @xmath0-cladding layer@xmath1-cladding layer . </S>",
    "<S> clear - signature evidences of giant conductance phenomena for hole transmission without valence - band mixing through a dbrt and a superlattice were found . </S>",
    "<S> the giant conductance effect losses robustness by manipulating the number of superlattice layers and by including the valence - band particles coupling as well . </S>",
    "<S> phase time through the heterostructure exhibits extremal dependencies in the gaps and in the barriers , as those reported before for electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected an earlier arrival phase time for the propagation of both flavors of holes within the barrier , in the order of few tenths of picoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> an appealing filter - like effect is presented , whenever a selective confinement strength arises independently for both flavors of holes in the uncoupled regime . </S>",
    "<S> our results also prescribe noticeable evidences for both uncoupled and coupled hole fluxes , similar to those foretold by hartman , upon transmission of electrons through opaque barriers .    </S>",
