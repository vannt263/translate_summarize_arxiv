    ", we use a butterworth @xmath24 filter of order @xmath25 ( see equation 7 in menezes et al .",
    "an inverse fourier transform is then applied to the filtered data . we should mention that similar noise filtering process has been already applied in the context of long slit spectroscopy of hh jets ( raga & mateo 1998 ) . the high - frequency cleaned data still show low - frequency noise which we remove using the principal component analysis ( pca ; see ricci , steiner & menezes 2011 and steiner et al .",

    "the scope of this paper is not to present this technique .",
    "however , it is worth to mention briefly how it works .",
    "the pca technique allows us to describe the data cube as a linear combination of an orthogonal basis , which are the eigenvectors of a 2d covariance matrix .",

    ", one defines a 2d intensity matrix * i*@xmath32 , which will be the subject of the pca analysis .",
    "its covariance matrix is calculated , and the eigenvectors with their associated variances are obtained ( e.g. , steiner et al .",
    "the higher its variance , the more representative of the data is a given eigenvector .",
    "as the orthogonality is ensured , we can compose a tomogram , which is an image that represents the projection of the original data onto a selected eigenvector ( or eigenvectors ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show a specific observed field ( field 8 in figure [ fig1 ] ) , for a given emission line ( @xmath33 ) , before any filtering process ( a ) , after the filtering process but extracting the emission line from data ( b ) , and the ( a)-(b ) subtraction in ( c ) .",
    "we should mention that the tomogram in ( b ) was obtained by adding the first two eigenvectors ( without the emission line ) , which we assume to correspond to the low - frequency noise , or the instrumental fingerprint , as described in ricci et al.(2011 ) .",
    "finally , we have applied a richardson - lucy deconvolution procedure with a gaussian psf , with a constant fwhm of @xmath15 for fields 7 and 8 , and a constante fwhm of @xmath17 for the fields 1 to 6 , as suggested by the seeing in our observations .",
    "six interactions has been used in order to deconvolve the original data with the psf ( see equation 10 in menezes et al .",
    "the whole procedure ( spatial re - sampling , low - noise filtering process , instrumental fingerprints removal technique and richardson - lucy deconvolution ) is explained in detail in menezes et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who has developed the technique .",
    "we present the spatially resolved line profiles as `` velocity channel maps '' in three velocity intervals :    * hvc : a high ( negative ) velocity channel , with radial velocities km s@xmath34 reipurth 1989 . ]",
    "@xmath35 km s@xmath34 , * mvc : a medium velocity channel , with @xmath36 km s@xmath34 @xmath37 km s@xmath34 , * lvc : a low velocity channel , with @xmath38 km s@xmath34 .",
    "we also present an image ( for each spectral line ) which consists of an addition of these three velocity channel maps .",
    "the channel maps and the images have been computed for mosaics composed of the 8 observed ifu fields ( see figure 1 ) , and cover the emission of the hh  111 jet at distances @xmath39 from the outflow source .",
    "the mosaics have been built taking into account the offsets ( given in table [ tab1 ] ) .    in figures",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] we show the images and velocity channel maps for [ s ii]@xmath406716+@xmath406731 , h@xmath2 , [ n ii]@xmath406548+@xmath406584 and [ o i]@xmath406300+@xmath406360 , respectively . in the [ s ii ] image ( left frame of figure [ fig3 ] )",
    "we see knots e through l , which can be clearly recognized comparing the image with the identifications of reipurth et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and reipurth et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .    in the channel maps of all of the observed lines ,",
    "it is clear that there is a general trend of increasing jet width as a function of decreasing velocity ( i.e. , in all of the observed emission lines the jet becomes narrower as we go from the hvc to the mvc and to the lvc , see figures [ fig3]-[fig6 ] ) .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the observations of riera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who found velocities decreasing away from the outflow axis in two long - slit spectra cutting the hh  111 jet at the approximate positions of knots d ( not detected in the present observations ) and f.      in order to illustrate the broadening of the jet at lower ( i.e. , less negative ) radial velocities , in figure 7 we show the lvc@xmath41hvc channel map subtraction for the h@xmath2 line .",
    "this subtraction map shows that at all positions along the observed region of the hh  111 , the high radial velocity emission is restricted to a narrow , central region of the jet cross section .",
    "one can quantify the width vs. radial velocity dependence by measuring the fwhm of the emission on the hvc , mvc and lvc channel maps .",
    "for all of the emission lines , we measure the widths on the three channel maps at the positions of knots e , f , g , h , j and l , integrating the emission in bins of @xmath42 along the jet bin ( centered at the positions of the knots ) .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in figure 8 , which shows the following features and [ o i ] lines show high uncertainties due to their low s / n ( see figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) . in a few cases ( knots g1 , h and k1 ; see figure [ fig8 ] ) we were not able to determine the [ n ii ] fwhm for some ( if not all ) velocity components . ]",
    "* there is a systematic increase of width as a function of decreasing radial velocity for all the knots , and in all emission lines , * with the exception of the very broad knot e , there is a general trend of increasing width vs. distance from the source , * in the lower excitation lines ( [ o i ] and [ s ii ] ) , the widths are somewhat lower than in the higher excitation lines ( h@xmath2 and [ n ii ] ) .        this last effect has been noted by reipurth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who note that the h@xmath2 emission is broader than the [ s ii ] emission ( see their figure 6 , in which they present an h@xmath2-[s ii ] subtraction map ) . in our observations , we see that in general the [ n ii ] emission has widths comparable to the h@xmath2 widths , and that the [ o i ] emission has narrower widths , comparable to the ones of the [ s ii ] emission .      in figure [ fig9 ]",
    "we present the spatial distribution of the [ s ii]@xmath406716/[s ii]@xmath406731 line ratio for the integrated line profiles and for the hvc , mvc and lvc maps .",
    "this ratio gives the electron density ( @xmath43 ) of the medium osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "for calculating @xmath43 we assume a temperature of 10@xmath44 k , consistent with the temperature of @xmath45 k found by podio et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the hh  111 jet .    superimposed on the spatial distribution of the electron density",
    "are the ( logarithmic spaced ) iso - contours of the [ s ii]@xmath406716 + @xmath406731 integrated intensity .",
    "the integrated map ( left ) shows that the electron density ranges from @xmath46 @xmath47 at knot e ( at @xmath48 26 arcsec from the outflow source ) up to @xmath49 cm @xmath50 in knot f ( at @xmath51 from knot e ; see figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "it then drops to @xmath52 @xmath47 between knots f and h. in knot h , the electron density has a strong peak of @xmath53 @xmath47 .",
    "interestingly , the electron density maps of the three velocity channels show systematically increasing densities for decreasing radial velocities .",
    "this is can be clearly seen at the positions of knots e , f and j. also , an increase in @xmath43 can be seen in the region between knots f and g when going from the mvc to the lvc electron density maps ( see the two frames on the right of figure 9 ) .",
    "we now focus on the interesting structure of knot e ( at @xmath54 from the source , see figures 3 - 7 ) .",
    "the structures observed in the images and channel maps of this knot are shown in figure 10 .",
    "we see that in the h@xmath2 and [ n ii ] images ( 2nd and 3rd rows of the far left column of figure 10 ) knot e shows two side - by - side peaks .",
    "these peaks have been observed in previous ground based ( reipurth et al .",
    "1992 ) and hst ( reipurth et al . 1997 ) h@xmath2 images of hh  111 .",
    "most interestingly , the two side - by - side peaks are well separated in the lvc h@xmath2 and [ n ii ] maps ( right column of figure 10 ) , approach each other in the mvc map , and merge into a single , central peak in the hvc map .",
    "therefore , we find that the two side - by - side peaks ( previously observed in h@xmath2 images , see reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ) actually enclose a fainter , higher radial velocity emission region .    in the lower excitation [ s ii ] and [ o i ] lines ,",
    "knot e shows two low intensity side - by - side peaks only in the lvc maps ( 1st and 4th rows of the far right column of figure 10 ) , and these peaks are not present in the mvc and hvc maps .",
    "the images of knot e in these lines ( 1st and 4th rows of the far left column of figure 10 ) show a conical structure which resembles the mvc emission .",
    "we have obtained ifu spectra of the hh  111 jet at distances of @xmath55 from the outflow source . from the spectra",
    ", we obtain position - velocity cubes for the [ s ii ] 6716 , 6731 ; h@xmath2 ; [ n ii ] 6548 , 6583 and [ o i ] 6300 , 6360 emission lines .",
    "* we find that for all emission lines we have an increase in the observed width of the jet for decreasing radial velocities .",
    "this effect can be seen directly in the velocity channel maps ( figures 3 - 6 ) , in subtractions of pairs of velocity channel maps ( figure 7 ) or more quantitatively in the widths measured for the jet knots ( figure 8) . a broadening in the hh  111",
    "jet for decreasing velocities has been previously observed by riera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and a qualitatively similar effect is seen in the co emission ( but at widths in excess of @xmath56 , see lefloch et al .",
    "2007 ) , * we find that the hh 111 jet is narrower in the lower ( [ s  ii ] and [ o  i ] ) than in the higher ( h@xmath2 and [ n  ii ] ) excitation lines at the vicinity of some knots ( namely , knots e , f k1 and l ) .",
    "this effect has been previously seen in the h@xmath2 and [ s  ii ] hst images of reipurth et al .",
    "these previous observations suggested that we might be seeing a sheath of non - radiative shocks ( seen only in h@xmath2 ) surrounding the hh  111 jet beam , but the detection of broad [ n ii ] emission indicates that the shocks in the sheath are indeed radiative , * from the [ s  ii ] 6716/6731 line ratio we systematically find larger electron densities at lower radial velocities ( see figure 9 ) , * the `` twin peak '' structure of knot e is clearly seen in the h@xmath2 and [ n ii ] images , but these two peaks merge into a central peak in the [ o i ] and [ s ii ] images . in all of the lines , the twin peaks are seen at low radial velocities ( see the lvc maps of figure 10 ) , but they approach and merge into a single peak at higher radial velocities",
    ".    these characteristics can be qualitatively explained in terms of an `` internal working surface '' model , in which the knots are produced as a result of an outflow velocity time - variability .",
    "in such a model , the variability produces pairs of shocks that travel down the jet beam , producing a high pressure region that ejects material into the cocoon of the jet .",
    "the observations of larger widths for the higher excitation emission would then be interpreted as higher velocity shocks produced by the material in this sideways ejection against a slower moving cocoon .",
    "the low excitation emission would be interpreted as coming from lower velocity shocks within the jet beam ( produced by the outflow velocity variability ) .",
    "the shock structure of internal working surfaces was described by raga et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and numerical simulations have been done for reproducing h@xmath2 images ( raga et al .",
    "2002b ) and long - slit spectra ( masciadri et al .",
    "2002 ) of the hh  111 jet .",
    "the data presented here clearly provide a substantial increase in the observational constraints , which should be a challenging test for future models of jet knots produced by an outflow variability or by other mechanisms ( see e.g. , micono et al .",
    "in particular , our data will give interesting constraints on the nature of the cross section of the outflow ( raga et al .",
    "2011 ) or of the possible presence of two distinct components ( teileanu et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we can speculate that mhd effects might be present , and might help to shape the morphology of the hh 111 emission knots as well as their line profiles .",
    "it is worth to note that recent and sophisticated mhd models predict that beam recollimation ( by the hoop stress ) plays an important role in order to enhance the brightness near the jet axis , as well as to accelerate the inner jet beam , making it faster than the surrounding jet material .",
    "this general result was obtained by teileanu et al ( 2014 ) , hansen , frank & hartigan ( 2014 ) and staff et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , in spite of the differences in the initial setup in these works . in hansen , frank & hartigan ( 2014 ) ,",
    "a pure toroidal magnetic field is used to study the jet propagation , while the disk wind solution is incorporated in the models from staff et al ( 2014 ) and teileanu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who actually introduced a two component ( stellar jet plus disk wind ) flow .",
    "another feature shown by some hh jets ( including some of the knots studied here ) is an increase of the fwhm of the jet beam with distance from the driving source .",
    "this feature has been predicted in the models presented by teileanu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and compared with available data from rw aur , hh 30 and hl tau , while the solutions presented in staff et al .",
    "( 2014 ) were compared with data from dg tau , hn tau , rw aur and uz tau . in both cases , the distances covered by the simulations were suitable for the study of the microjets ( @xmath57 au ) . whether or not these effects are still important farther away from the driving source ( the knot e is at @xmath58 au from the vla 1 source ) is an issue that should be addressed properly in future work .",
