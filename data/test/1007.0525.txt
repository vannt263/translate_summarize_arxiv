    "we limit ourselves to a two - cluster rgm , which is based on binary - cluster channel states of total angular momentum @xmath32 , parity @xmath33 , and isospin @xmath34 , @xmath35^{(j^\\pi t)}\\,\\frac{\\delta(r - r_{a - a , a})}{rr_{a - a , a}}\\,.\\label{basis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the internal ( antisymmetric ) wave functions of the first and second cluster , containing @xmath38 and @xmath39 nucleons ( @xmath40 ) , respectively .",

    "the cluster centers of mass are separated by the relative coordinate @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the @xmath14 single - particle coordinates .",
    "the channel states  ( [ basis ] ) have relative angular momentum @xmath49 .",
    "it is convenient to group all relevant quantum numbers into a cumulative index @xmath50 .",
    "the former basis states can be used to expand the many - body wave function according to @xmath51 as the basis states  ( [ basis ] ) are not anti - symmetric under exchange of nucleons belonging to different clusters , in order to preserve the pauli principle one has to introduce the appropriate inter - cluster anti - symmetrizer , schematically @xmath52 where the sum runs over all possible permutations @xmath53 that can be carried out among nucleons pertaining to different clusters , and @xmath29 is the number of interchanges characterizing them .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion  ( [ trial ] ) are the relative - motion wave functions @xmath54 , which represent the only unknowns of the problem . to determine them one has to solve the non - local integro - differential coupled - channel equations @xmath55",

    "we have used the notation @xmath58 and @xmath59 to denote the total energy in the center - of - mass frame , and the intrinsic @xmath14-nucleon microscopic hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "the formalism presented above is combined with the _ ab initio _ ncsm in two steps :    first , we note that the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the ( @xmath38)- and @xmath39-nucleon intrinsic hamiltonians , respectively , @xmath63 is the relative kinetic energy and @xmath64 is the sum of all interactions between nucleons belonging to different clusters after subtraction of the average coulomb interaction between them , explicitly singled out in the term @xmath65 ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the charge numbers of the clusters in channel @xmath68 ) .",
    "we use identical realistic potentials in both the cluster s hamiltonians and inter - cluster interaction @xmath64 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are obtained by diagonalizing @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , in the model space spanned by the ncsm @xmath69 ho basis .",
    "note that in the present paper we use soft srg evolved @xmath11 potentials .",
    "therefore , there is no need to derive any further effective interaction tailored to the model space truncation as with these soft interactions our calculations converge in the model spaces we are able to reach .",
    "second , we replace the delta functions in the localized parts of the hamiltonian  ( [ h - kernel ] ) and the norm  ( [ n - kernel ] ) kernels with their representation in the ho model space .",
    "we use identical ho frequency as for the cluster eigenstate wave functions and a consistent model space size ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we emphasize that this replacement is performed only for the localized parts of the kernels .",
    "the diagonal parts coming from the identity operator in the antisymmetrizers , the kinetic term and the average coulomb potential are treated exactly .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the ncsm / rgm formalism in the single - nucleon projectile basis , i.e. , for binary - cluster channel states  ( [ basis ] ) with @xmath71 ( with channel index @xmath72 ) . as an illustration , let s discuss in more detail the norm kernel that is rather simple in this basis : @xmath73 we can easily recognize a direct term , in which initial and final state are identical ( corresponding to diagram @xmath74 of fig .  [ diagram - norm - pot ] ) , and a many - body correction due to the exchange part of the inter - cluster anti - symmetrizer ( corresponding to diagram @xmath75 of fig .",
    "[ diagram - norm - pot ] ) .",
    "we note that in calculating the matrix elements of the exchange operator @xmath76 we replaced the delta function of eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) with its representation in the ho model space as discussed above .",
    "this is appropriate as the transposition @xmath76 operator acting on the traget wave function is short - to - medium range . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath77-function coming from the identity is treated exactly .",
    "the presence of the inter - cluster anti - symmetrizer affects also the hamiltonian kernel , and , in particular , the matrix elements of the interaction . for a @xmath11 potential one obtains a direct term involving interaction and exchange of two nucleons only ( see diagrams ( @xmath78 ) and ( @xmath79 ) of fig .  [ diagram - norm - pot ] ) , and an exchange term involving three - nucleons .",

    "[ diagram - norm - pot ] describes this latter term , in which the last nucleon is exchanged with one of the nucleons of the first cluster , and interacts with yet another nucleon . for more details on the integration kernels in the single - nucleon projectile basis",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "being translationally - invariant quantities , the norm and hamiltonian kernels can be  naturally \" derived working within the ncsm jacobi - coordinate basis . however , by introducing slater - determinant channel states of the type @xmath81^{(j^\\pi t ) } r_{n\\ell}(r^{(a)}_{\\rm c.m.})\\ , , \\label{sd - basis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the eigenstates of the @xmath82-nucleon fragment are obtained in the sd basis ( while the second cluster is still a ncsm jacobi - coordinate eigenstate ) , it can be easily demonstrated that translationally invariant matrix elements can be extracted from those calculated in the sd basis of eq .",

    "these are the equations that we finally solve to obtain both our scattering and bound - state results .      the primary limitation for the range of applicability of the ncsm in terms of particle number @xmath14 and model spaces size @xmath95 results from the factorial growth of the dimension of the @xmath96 space .",
    "except for light isotopes , it is hardly possible to obtain a converged result using a bare hamiltonian within the @xmath96 spaces that are computationally tractable .    at this point",
    "the importance truncation offers a solution .",
    "the importance truncation in connection with the ncsm was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we summarize a few key features of the it - ncsm and generalize the approach to the simultaneous description of excited states .    the motivation for the importance truncation results from the observation that the expansion of any particular eigenstate of the hamiltonian in a full @xmath97-scheme ncsm space typically contains a large number of basis states with extremely small or vanishing amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes define an adaptive truncation criterion , which takes into account the properties of the hamiltonian and the structure of the eigenstate under consideration . if those amplitudes were known  at least approximately  before actually solving the eigenvalue problem , one could reduce the model space to the most relevant basis states by imposing a threshold on the amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of a particular basis state @xmath98 in the expansion of a specific eigenstate can be estimated using first - order multiconfigurational perturbation theory . in order to set up a perturbation series we need an initial approximation of the target state , the so - called reference state @xmath99 . in practice",
    "this reference state will be a superposition of basis states @xmath100 from a reference space @xmath101 : @xmath102 the reference state and the amplitudes @xmath103 are typically extracted from a previous ncsm calculation . based on @xmath99 as unperturbed state",
    ", we can evaluate the first - order perturbative correction to the target state resulting from basis states @xmath104 .",
    "their first - order amplitude defines the so - called importance measure @xmath105 the energy denominator @xmath106 in a mller - plesset - type partitioning is simply given by the unperturbed harmonic - oscillator excitation energy of the basis state @xmath98 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    imposing an importance threshold @xmath107",
    ", we construct an importance truncated model space including all basis states with importance measure @xmath108 .",
    "since the importance measure is zero for all basis states that differ from all of the states in @xmath101 by more than a two - particle - two - hole excitation , we have to embed the construction of the importance truncated space into an iterative update cycle . after constructing the importance truncated space and solving the eigenvalue problem in that space",
    ", we obtain an improved approximation for the target state that defines a reference state for the next iteration . in order to accelerate the evaluation of the importance measure",
    ", we typically do not use the complete eigenstate as new reference state , but project it onto a reference space spanned by the basis states with @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are the coefficients resulting from the solution of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the second threshold @xmath111 will be chosen sufficiently small so as not to affect the results for a given @xmath107 threshold .",
    "simple iterative update schemes can be devised for any type of full model spaces , as discussed in refs .",
    "specifically for the @xmath96 space of the ncsm , however , there is an efficient sequential update scheme leading to the it - ncsm(seq ) approach .",
    "it is based on the fact that all states of an @xmath112 space can be generated from the basis states of an @xmath96 space using two - particle - two - hole excitations at most .",
    "thus a single importance update starting from a reference state in an @xmath96 space gives access to all relevant states in an @xmath112 space . making use of this property , in the it - ncsm(seq )",
    "we start with a full ncsm calculation in , e.g. , @xmath113 and use this eigenstate after applying the @xmath111 threshold as reference state for constructing the importance truncated @xmath114 space . after solving the eigenvalue problem for this importance truncated",
    "@xmath114 space we use the resulting eigenstate as reference state to construct the @xmath115 space , and so on .",
    "thus only one importance update is required for each value of @xmath95 , which makes this scheme very efficient computationally . moreover , in the limit of vanishing thresholds , @xmath116 , this scheme recovers the full @xmath96 space at each step of the sequence , i.e. , the it - ncsm(seq ) would recover the full ncsm result .",
    "based on this limiting property , we can obtain a numerical approximation to the full ncsm result by extrapolating the it - ncsm(seq ) observables obtained for a set of different importance thresholds @xmath107 ( and in principle also @xmath111 ) to @xmath117 . through this extrapolation ,",
    "the contribution of discarded basis states , i.e. those with importance measures @xmath118 below the smallest threshold considered , is effectively recovered . because the control parameter @xmath107 is tied to the physical structure of the eigenstate",
    ", we observe a smooth threshold dependence for all observables , which allows for a robust threshold extrapolation . in the case of the energy we can improve the quality of the extrapolation further by considering a perturbative second - order estimate for the energy of the excluded basis states .",
    "while setting up the importance truncated space , all second - order energy contributions @xmath119 for the discarded states with @xmath120 are summed up to provide a correction @xmath121 to the energy eigenvalue . by construction",
    "this correction goes to zero in the limit @xmath117 .",
    "we use this additional information for a constrained simultaneous extrapolation of the energy to vanishing threshold with and without perturbative correction for the excluded states as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the whole concept can be generalized to the description of excited states .",
    "for the present application in connection with the ncsm / rgm , we aim at an importance truncated model space that is equally well suited for the description of the lowest @xmath122 eigenstates of the hamiltonian for given parity and total angular momentum projection . instead of using a single reference state ,",
    "we employ different reference states @xmath123 , with @xmath124 , for each of the @xmath122 target states . for each reference state",
    "we define a separate importance measure @xmath125 following eq . .",
    "a basis state @xmath126 is included in the importance truncated space if at least one of the importance measures @xmath127 is above the threshold @xmath107 , i.e. , if it is relevant for the description of at least one of the @xmath122 target states it will be included .",
    "because the different eigenstates are typically dominated by different basis states , the dimension of the importance truncated space grows linearly with @xmath122 .    in the it - ncsm(seq ) scheme",
    "we start with a full ncsm calculation in @xmath113 and use the lowest @xmath122 eigenstates as initial reference states @xmath123 . based on the corresponding importance measures",
    "@xmath125 the importance truncated @xmath114 space is constructed and the lowest @xmath122 eigenvectors in this space serve as new reference states ( after application of the @xmath111 threshold ) for the construction of the @xmath115 space , and so on . from a sequence of it - ncsm(seq ) calculations we obtain a set of @xmath122 eigenvectors for each value of @xmath95 which can be used to evaluate other observables .    by default",
    "we compute the expectation values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 as well as the expectation values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , since we use an importance truncated space in the @xmath97-scheme without explicit angular momentum projection , the eigenstates are not guaranteed to have good angular momentum and isospin .",
    "we therefore monitor the expectation values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 and find values which typically differ by less then @xmath132 from the exact quantum numbers . as in the full ncsm we separate spurious center - of - mass ( cm ) excitations from the physical spectrum by adding a lawson term @xmath133 to the translationally invariant intrinsic hamiltonian @xmath130 ( with the typical choice @xmath134 ) .",
    "the use of this modified hamiltonian provides at the same time a diagnostic for potential cm contaminations of the intrinsic states induced by the importance truncation . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the independence of the intrinsic energies @xmath135 on @xmath136 and the smallness of @xmath137 demonstate that the it - ncsm(seq ) solutions are free of cm contaminations .    eventually , the wave functions obtained in the it - ncsm(seq ) together with the threshold extrapolated intrinsic energies form the input for the ncsm / rgm calculations discussed in the following .",
