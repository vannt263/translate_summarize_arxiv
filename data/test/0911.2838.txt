    "recent astronomical observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicate that the universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion   @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration has also been confirmed by other observations , such as observations of large scale structure ( lss )  @xcite and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy  @xcite . nowadays",
    "the most well - accepted idea is that a mysterious dominant component  dark energy  with large enough negative pressure is responsible for this the cosmic acceleration . despite the fact that the cosmological origin of dark energy remains enigmatic at present",
    ", physicists have to face the intriguing physical problem and try to understand the ultimate nature of dark energy . among all theoretical models ,",
    "the preferred candidate of dark energy is the einstein s cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest cosmological model is the so - called @xmath1cdm ( or lcdm ) model , which consists of a mixture of the cosmological constant @xmath1 and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the lcdm model provides an excellent explanation for the acceleration of the universe and the existing observational data .",
    "however , the cosmological constant faces two difficulties , namely , the  fine - tuning \" problem and the  cosmic coincidence \" problem .",
    "the former asks why the cosmological constant observed today is so much smaller than the plank scale , while the latter asks why the energy densities of dark energy and matter are on the same order today .",
    "theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological constant problem but all these efforts have turned out to be unsuccessful .    in order to alleviate or even solve these two problems ,",
    "many dynamical dark energy models have been proposed , whose equation of state is no longer a constant but slightly evolves with time .",
    "the dynamical dark energy scenario is often realized by some scalar - field mechanism which suggests that the energy with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential . a lot of scalar field",
    "dark energy models have been studied , such as quintessence , _",
    "k_-essence , tachyon , phantom and quintom etc .. besides , some interacting models have been discussed in many works to help understand or alleviate the coincidence problem by considering the possible interaction between dark energy and dark matter owing to their unknown nature . for reviews of dark energy ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in various dark energy models , the property of dark energy is strongly model - dependent . in order to be capable of differentiating those competing cosmological dark energy scenarios ,",
    "a sensitive diagnostic for the many dark energy models is a must . for characterizing the expansion history of the universe",
    ", one defines the geometric parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , namely , the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter ; here @xmath4 is the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "it is clear that @xmath5 means that the universe is undergoing an expansion and @xmath6 means the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the cosmic acceleration indicates that @xmath7 should be less than zero .",
    "however the deceleration parameter on its own does not characterize the current acceleration phase uniquely .",
    "the presence of a fairly large degeneracy in @xmath7 is reflected in the fact that rival dark energy models can give rise to the same value of @xmath8 at the present time . under such circumstances , a robust diagnostic of dark energy , statefinder parameter pair @xmath9 ,",
    "was introduced by sahni et al .",
    "@xcite and alam et al .",
    "in addition , more recently , two new diagnostics of dark energy , @xmath10 and acceleration probe @xmath11 , were introduced by sahni , shafieloo and starobinsky  @xcite .",
    "the statefinder probes the expansion dynamics of the universe through high derivatives of the scale factor @xmath12 and @xmath13 and is a natural next step beyond the hubble parameter @xmath14 depending on @xmath15 and the deceleration parameter @xmath7 depending on @xmath12 .",
    "the statefinder pair @xmath0 is defined as @xmath16 @xmath17 it is a `` geometrical '' diagnostic , in the sense that it is constructed from a space - time metric directly , and it is more universal than `` physical '' variables , which depend upon properties of physical fields describing dark energy .",
    "so , in order to see the qualitatively different cosmological evolution behaviors of dark energy models in degeneracy of @xmath18 and @xmath8 , we can plot statefinder parameter diagrams corresponding to these dark energy models by theoretical calculation . as a reference the spatially flat lcdm scenario corresponds to a fixed point @xmath19 in this diagram .",
    "departure of a given dark energy model from this fixed point provides a good way of establishing the `` distance '' of this model from the lcdm  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the statefinder can also be extracted from data coming from supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) type experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statefinder diagnostic combined with future snap observations may possibly be used to discriminate between different dark energy models . in this paper",
    ", we just apply the statefinder diagnostic to the new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) model .",
    "we will investigate the features of the nade model with interaction with matter component from the statefinder view point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : agegrapgic ] , we will briefly review the nade model and introduce an interacting model of nade . in sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , we will study the cosmological evolution of the interacting nade model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statefinder ] , we will apply the statefinder diagnostic to the interacting nade model . in the last section we will give conclusions .",
    "first , let us review the nade model . so far , we can not confirm if dark energy imitates as a cosmological constant or a dynamical field .",
    "generally , theorists believe that we can not entirely understand the nature of dark energy before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established  @xcite . however",
    ", we still can make some efforts to probe the properties of dark energy according to some principle of quantum gravity .",
    "the holographic dark energy model @xcite and the agegraphic dark energy model  @xcite are examples , possessing some significant features of quantum gravity .",
    "the former stems from the holographic principle and the latter is constructed in light of the k@xmath20rolyh@xmath20zy relation @xcite and corresponding energy fluctuations of space - time . in this paper , we just fucus on the agegraphic dark energy model .    in general relativity",
    ", one can measure the space - time without any limit to accuracy .",
    "however , in the quantum mechanics , the well - known heisenberg uncertainty relation puts a limit of accuracy in these measurements . following the line of quantum fluctuations of spacetime , krolyhzy and collaborators  @xcite made an interesting observation concerning the distance measurement for minkowski spacetime through a light - clock gedanken experiment ; namely , the distance @xmath21 in minkowski space - time can not be known to a better accuracy than @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "we use the units @xmath24 throughout this paper .",
    "thus , one can use the terms like length and time interchangeably , whereas @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the reduced planck length , time and mass , respectively .",
    "the krolyhzy relation  ( [ eq1 ] ) together with the time - energy uncertainty relation enables one to estimate a quantum energy density of the metric fluctuations of minkowski space - time . following refs .",
    "@xcite , with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) a length scale @xmath21 can be known with a maximum precision @xmath29 , determining thereby a minimal detectable cell @xmath30 over a spatial region @xmath31 .",
    "such a cell represents a minimal detectable unit of space - time over a given length scale @xmath21 .",
    "if the age of the minkowski space - time is @xmath21 , then over a spatial region with linear size @xmath21 ( determining the maximal observable patch ) there exists a minimal cell @xmath32 , the energy of which due to the fact that the time - energy uncertainty relation can not be smaller than @xmath33 therefore , the energy density of metric fluctuations of minkowski space - time is given by @xmath34 based on the energy density  ( [ eq3 ] ) , the so - called agegraphic dark energy model was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model , as the most natural choice , the time scale @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is chosen to be the age of the universe @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scale factor of our universe , and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter .",
    "thus , the energy density of the agegraphic dark energy is given by  @xcite @xmath37 where the numerical factor @xmath38 has been introduced to parameterize some uncertainties , such as the species of quantum fields in the universe , or the effect of curved space - time ( since the energy density is derived for minkowski space - time ) .",
    "obviously , since the present age of the universe @xmath39 ( the subscript @xmath40 indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity ) , the present energy density of the agegraphic dark energy explicitly meets the observed value naturally , provided that the numerical factor @xmath41 is of order unity .",
    "in addition , by choosing the age of the universe rather than the future event horizon as the length measure , the drawback concerning causality in the holographic dark energy model does not exist in the agegraphic dark energy model  @xcite .",
    "if we consider a spatially flat frw universe containing agegraphic dark energy and pressureless matter , the corresponding friedmann equation reads @xmath42 it is convenient to introduce the fractional energy densities @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath7 . from eq .",

    ". therefore a new version of the agegraphic dark energy model was proposed to resolve the difficulties by replacing the timescale @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with the conformal time @xmath56  @xcite . this new version",
    "is often called the `` new agegraphic dark energy '' model . in this new version ,",
    "the energy density of the agegraphic dark energy reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the conformal age of the universe .",
    "the corresponding fractional energy density reads @xmath59 again we consider a flat frw universe containing the new agegraphic dark energy and matter . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ defrho])@xmath47([defomega ] ) and the energy conservation equation @xmath48 , we find that the equation of motion for @xmath49 is @xmath60 from the energy conservation equation @xmath52 , as well as eqs .",

    "( [ domega ] ) and  ( [ w ] ) in the case of @xmath73  ( i.e. without interaction ) .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath74 and eos of the nade model for the cases with and without interaction .",
    "next , let us look into some properties of this model .",
    "consider first the properties of the new agegraphic dark energy without interaction . in the radiation - dominated epoch , @xmath75 whereas @xmath76 ; in the matter - dominated epoch , @xmath77 whereas @xmath78 ; eventually , the new agegraphic dark energy dominates ; in the late time @xmath79 when @xmath80 , the new agegraphic dark energy mimics a cosmological constant .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . )",
    "it is worth noting that this nade model without interaction is a single - parameter model because of its special analytic features in the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated epochs .",
    "concretely , in the matter - dominated epoch , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the redshift .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 can be used as the initial condition to solve the differential equation of @xmath49 at any @xmath84 provided that it is sufficiently deep into the matter - dominated epoch .",
    "we choose here @xmath85 in the initial condition , just as in ref .",
    "if @xmath41 is given , we can obtain @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ indomega ] ) by using the initial condition .",
    "then , all other physical quantities , such as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , can be obtained correspondingly .",
    "when interaction @xmath62 is included , the situation is changed . for nade model without interaction ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "the eos @xmath88 is always larger than @xmath89 and can not cross the phantom divide @xmath90 , see eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) .",

    "this means that the eos @xmath88 can possibly cross the phantom divide in the interacting nade model . in this case , it should be pointed out that the initial condition @xmath83 with @xmath85 can also be used . in matter - dominated epoch",
    ", the contribution of dark energy to the cosmological evolution is negligible so that the impact of dark energy on matter can be ignored .",
    "that is to say , dark energy can not affect the evolution behavior of matter at early times in spite of the existence of the interaction .",

    "thus , it is worthwhile to investigate the interacting nade model .",
    "we do this by applying the statefinder parameters as a diagnostic tool and plot the statefinder trajectories in the @xmath134 plane .",
    "we learn that the interaction between dark energy and dark matter can significantly affect the evolution of the universe , and the contribution of the interaction can be diagnosed out explicitly in this method .",
    "in addition , we show cosmological evolution of @xmath104 . for this interacting dark energy model",
    ", the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath151 both play important roles and thus affect the cosmological evolution .",
    "but , to determine @xmath41 and @xmath151 , we need more precise data provided by future experiments . we hope that the future high - precision observations can offer more and more accurate data to determine these parameters precisely and consequently shed light on the essence of dark energy .",
