    "resonant tunneling ( rt ) through double - barrier structures ( dbs ) make these systems very promising candidates for a new generation of ultra - high speed electronic devices . for instance",
    ", a gaas - ga@xmath1al@xmath0as dbs operating at thz frequencies has been reported in the literature.@xcite the basic reason for rt to arise in dbs is a quantum phenomenon whose fundamental characteristics are by now well understood : there exists a dramatic increase of the electron transmission whenever the energy of the incident electron is close to one of the unoccupied quasi - bound - states inside the well.@xcite in practice , a bias voltage is applied to shift the energy of this quasi - bound - state of nonzero width so that its center matches the fermi level .",
    "consequently , the @xmath2 characteristics present negative differential resistance when the quasi - bound - state lies well below the fermi level .    in actual samples , however , the situation is much more complex than this simple picture .",
    "scattering by phonons , electrons or defects reduces the required quantum coherence and , in fact , deviations from the above simple description are observed .",
    "these scattering mechanisms explain the occurrence of side - band resonant peaks due to the interaction with phonons@xcite and photons,@xcite hysteresis in the @xmath2 characteristics due to many body effects,@xcite and the decrease of electron mobility due to rough surfaces even in good - quality heterostructures.@xcite while one - dimensional models successfully describe scattering by electrons and phonons , they obviously can not account for all interface roughness effects .",
    "so far , there are analytical results concerning the propagation of wave packets in a randomly layered medium when the potential is a random function of only one coordinate,@xcite but for a small number of layers , as in dbs , in - plane disorder becomes important and one expects such approaches to fail .",
    "realistic models of in - plane disorder , including power - like or exponential spatial correlations observed by transmission electron microscopy , usually lead to intractable analytical models ; hence the importance of numerically solvable models to bridge this gap .",
    "an important contribution was already provided by henrickson _",
    "et al . _ , who applied the tight - binding green function method to interface roughness in dbs.@xcite in this paper transmission was studied for a dbs with a rather simple model of disorder ( periodic roughness with random relative phases at the interfaces ) .",
    "a level splitting was found for narrow well dbs and a dependence on the roughness lateral size was observed .    in this work we present a simple two - dimensional model that allowed us to carry out an extensive study of electron scattering by interface roughness and how it manifests trough vertical transport properties of the dbs . in particular , we aim to elucidate the relationship between macroscopic properties of the dbs ( e.g. conductance ) with microscopic parameters of the model ( e.g. correlation length of the surface disorder ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the body of the paper is sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , where we present our model based , on the effective - mass approximation , describing a disordered sample ( e.g. an imperfect dbs ) connected to two perfectly ohmic leads .",
    "the ben daniel - duke equation is discretized , boundary conditions are discussed and scattering solutions are found by means of the transfer - matrix method for _ any _ arbitrary heterostructure made of wide gap semiconductors .",
    "afterwards , expressions for two - terminal conductance and current for unintentionally disordered dbs are provided .",
    "the model is worked out in a two - dimensional space for computational limitations , although it will be clear that generalization to three dimensions is rather straightforward .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] describes the various models of disorder we have used to mimic structural data obtained by transmission electron microscopy and x - ray scattering . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we present the numerical results and , in particular , the relationship between macroscopic properties of the dbs with microscopic parameters of the model . finally , in sec .  [ sec5 ] we discuss our results and the main conclusions of the work .",
    "we consider the single - electron two - dimensional schrdinger equation within the framework of the one - band effective - mass approximation .",
    "close to the @xmath3 valley , this approach leads to the ben daniel - duke equation for the envelope function @xmath4\\psi(y , z)=e\\psi(y , z).\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the coordinate along the growth direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "notice that we have taken a constant effective mass @xmath6 at the @xmath3 valley although this is not a serious limitation as the model can be easily generalized to include a position - dependent effective mass .",
    "we then consider a mesh with lattice spacings @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the @xmath9 and @xmath5 directions , respectively .",
    "defining @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we arrive at the following discretized version of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xmath12 the potential term @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) is given by the conduction - band edge energy at the point @xmath14 which , in turn , depends on the al mole fraction in the vicinity of that position .",
    "consequently , both kinds of disorder ( lateral and compositional ) are taken into account through this diagonal term ( diagonal disorder ) .      in order to solve the tight binding - like equation  ( [ discrete ] ) we use the transfer matrix method based on the solutions calculated for each slide of the system along the @xmath5 direction . to this end , we define    @xmath15    and @xmath16    here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of mesh divisions in the @xmath9 and @xmath5 directions , respectively .",
    "note that periodic boundary conditions have been taken into account on each slide . with these definitions , eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) can be cast in a more compact form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath22 identity and null matrices respectively .",
    "this expression allows us to relate by iteration the envelope function amplitudes at non - consecutive slides .",
    "in particular , we can obtain the expression of the envelope function amplitudes in the left contact as a function of the amplitudes in the right one    @xmath23    where @xmath24    is the transfer matrix for the heterostructure .",
    "we are interested in the scattering of electrons incident from the left contact .",
    "the envelope functions within the contacts will be determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions are open in the @xmath5 direction , and periodic on each slide , that is in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the former imply plane wave solutions in the @xmath5 axis , and the latter yield an energy discretization on @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "this discretization results in a number of transverse channels equal to the number of points in the transverse mesh direction . considering by the moment @xmath25 at the contacts and setting @xmath26 , a particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) is given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 is a normalization constant that is needed for the different _ propagating _ modes to carry the same current all of them .",
    "this normalization constant is given by @xmath29 note that we consider a dependence on the index @xmath30 of the momentum in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "this is a consequence of the implicit assumption that all the scattering processes in region  ii are elastic , so energy is conserved .",
    "thus , for a given energy @xmath31 + 1 \\right\\}.\\ ] ] finally we can write a general solution of the scattering problem for an electron of energy @xmath32 impinging on the scattering region on the @xmath30 transverse mode . on the left contact the solution will be of the form    @xmath33    on the right contact we have @xmath34    the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 appearing in these two solutions are the _ reflection _ and _ transmission _ matrices and they are responsible for the channel _ mixing _ due to scattering events .",
    "thus , @xmath37 represents the probability amplitude for an electron impinging in channel @xmath38 to be reflected into the chanel @xmath39 .",
    "similarly @xmath40 represents the probability amplitude for an electron impinging in chanel @xmath38 to be transmited through the scattering region ii into the channel @xmath39 .",
    "note that the solution within region ii is unknown .",
    "actually , we are not interested in this solution since all the physics of the scattering problem is contained in the _ mixing _ matrices @xmath36 and @xmath35 . in the following",
    ", our main goal will be to relate the elements of @xmath36 and @xmath35 to those of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ transfer ] ) .",
    "we start by re - writting formally eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) as @xmath42 .",
    "now we perform the following transformation upon the envelope functions @xmath43 it is easy to see that the hamiltonian is invariant under such a transformation , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "this is clear since @xmath36 and @xmath45 formally commute as they act upon different vector spaces .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 is invariant implies that @xmath41 is not affected by transformation  ( [ transformation ] ) so it remains unchanged .",
    "in addition , equations  ( [ solutioni ] ) and  ( [ solutioniii ] ) are transformed into    @xmath47    and @xmath48    respectively , where we have defined @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for each channel @xmath30 we can write the transform of eq .",
    "( [ transfer ] ) as @xmath51 now , introducing the definitions @xmath52 we arrive at the following transform of eq .",
    "( [ chanel_l ] ) in terms of the elements of the _ mixing _ matrices @xmath53 and , finally , we have @xmath54 that give us the matrix elements @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 for each channel @xmath30 in terms of the product of two known matrices and the transformed solutions  ( [ new_solutioniii ] ) at the right contact for the @xmath30 channel .",
    "it is worth noticing that all the scattering information is contained in the transfer matrix @xmath41 .",
    "thus , this quantity turns out to be the fundamental object in the resolution of the scattering problem .",
    "once @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been calculated , obtaining @xmath36 and @xmath35 is an easy task .",
    "however , the matrices calculated this way are the _ response _ matrices that contains some non - physical information .",
    "this non - physical information comes from the fact that we have been considering _ all _ the mathematical solutions of the scattering problem , including those diverging at infinity .",
    "these solutions are those for which momentum in eq .",
    "( [ kl ] ) is an imaginary number . in order to avoid the unphysical solutions we will cancel out all the elements on @xmath36 for which the incoming and/or the outgoing transverse quantum number @xmath30 satisfy the following condition @xmath60 once the physical _ mixing _",
    "matrices are known , particularly the transmission matrix @xmath36 , we can use them to calculate different physical quantities like the conductance or the electric current . from the landauer - bttiker formalism,@xcite",
    "the zero temperature two - leads multichannel conductance can be calculated using de fisher - lee formula@xcite @xmath61 in order to calculate the electric current due to an applied field @xmath62 we have to modify slightly our equations and further approximations are needed .",
    "first of all , we consider perfect leads , so no voltage drop occurs within the contacts .",
    "besides , we will not consider the contribution to the current of electrons impinging from the right contact . this is a good approximation provided @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the voltage drop along the region  i and @xmath65 is the electron fermi level on the contacts .",
    "finally , we will assume zero temperature so no carrier statistics will be taken into account .",
    "when an electric field applied along the growth direction is considered , the potential @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is constant in the contacts ( @xmath69 in region  i and @xmath70 in region  iii ) and behaves linearly in region  ii , namely @xmath71 . here",

    "let us stress that the generalization to three - dimensional heterostructures is fairly straightforward . with these results at hand , we can compute the transport magnitudes we mentioned above .",
    "all expressions are very simple and suitable for an efficient numerical treatment for any specific case .",
    "we will now evaluate them for unintentionally disordered dbs to describe the relevant features of the model .",
    "unintentional disorder appearing during growth in _ actual _ heterostructures depends critically on the growth conditions . there",
    "exist several techniques , like scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite and x - ray scattering ,  @xcite which have been applied in recent years to quantitatively determine structural properties of multilayers and superlattices .",
    "precise information about the nature and extend of defects at interfaces is now available .",
    "following mder _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "disorder in a heterostructure can be classified into two categories , namely lateral and vertical.@xcite lateral disorder occurs whenever one semiconductor protrudes into the other , forming chemically intermixed interfaces , steps and islands . as a consequence , the interface is not flat and translational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the growth direction is broken . on the other side , vertical disorder",
    "is observed whenever layer thicknesses fluctuate around their nominal values .",
    "compositional disorder due to different local al concentration in each ga@xmath1al@xmath83as layer can be viewed as mixing of vertical and lateral disorder .      in order to treat lateral disorder",
    "we have considered the formation of islands on the interface between two consecutive layers having identical lateral sizes all of them and being consecutive one to each other . in our model islands have heights that are randomly distributed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to express the rough profile of the interface between two consecutive layers defining the following height function @xmath84 -1\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath85 represents the deviation from the flat surface at position @xmath9 , @xmath86 is the heavyside theta function , @xmath87 is the island width , @xmath88 is a random variable associated to the @xmath89th island that controls the fluctuation around the mean value , and @xmath90 is the largest deviation in absolute value assuming that the @xmath88 s are uniformly distributed between @xmath91 and @xmath92 . hereafter @xmath90 will be referred to as degree of _ lateral disorder_. in the following , two models will be introduced .",
    "first of all , uncorrelated disorder will be considered , for which the random variables @xmath88 take values from @xmath91 to @xmath92 uniformly , satisfying the following correlator @xmath93 .",
    "however , experimental data and theoretical models of molecular - beam - epitaxy growth processes@xcite indicate that the heigths of the surface at distant points are strongly correlated .",
    "to mimic this situation , we will consider a second model of lateral disorder where the @xmath88 s are normally distributed with zero mean satisfying the exponential correlator @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the correlation length of the disorder .",
    "compositional disorder in gaas - al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures is due to the lack of spatial uniformity of the al mole fraction during the heterostructure growth process .",
    "we will simulate compositional disorder by defining a spatial two - dimensional mesh over the al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barriers , as shown in fig .",
    "we will associate a value @xmath96 for the al mole fraction to each region of the mesh .",
    "this value will fluctuate randomly around the nominal value of the aluminum fraction on the barrier @xmath97 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the maximum fluctuation of the al mole fraction , and @xmath100 is a random variable related to the @xmath101 point of the mesh , taking values uniformly between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that the overall averaged mole fraction is equal to @xmath102 .",
    "we have performed several numerical calculations in order to study the effect of both lateral and compositional disorder over the transport properties of dbs made of gaas - al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructures .",
    "we start by considering the effect of the interface roughness , characterized by the degree of lateral disorder @xmath90 given in ( [ deviation ] ) , on the conductance .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the conductance calculated for different values of @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath103 nm , @xmath104 nm , @xmath105 nm , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . the barrier widths are @xmath108 nm for both the emitter and the collector , their heights are also the same , @xmath109ev , and the well width is @xmath110 nm . the curves correspond to an ensemble average of the conductance curves over @xmath111 different realizations of the lateral disorder .",
    "three different values of @xmath90 were studied , namely @xmath112 ( perfect dbs ) , @xmath113 nm ( largest fluctuation of the order of one monolayer ) and @xmath114 nm ( largest fluctuation of the order of two monolayers ) . as a main result , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that increasing the degree of lateral disorder , @xmath90 , results in a decrease of the conductance at the resonant energy .",
    "notice that the resonant conductance peak slightly widens due to the fluctuations of its energy for each realization of the disorder .",
    "besides , an additional effect can be seen , that is , as the degree of lateral disorder @xmath90 increases the conductance peak shifts to smaller energies .",
    "this effect will be important in order to explain the @xmath2 characteristics later .",
    "regarding the effect of the size of the islands , @xmath87 , we have observed that it can be neglected unless this size is of the order of the electron wavelength , that is , for @xmath115 the conductance does not depend on @xmath87 .",
    "as expected , when @xmath116 the electron starts to _ see _ the disorder and then the conductance increases as @xmath87 decreases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for energies about @xmath117ev",
    "this transition takes place at sizes @xmath118 nm  @xcite .",
    "current as a function of the applied bias is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for this calculation",
    "we have chosen @xmath103 nm , @xmath119 nm , @xmath120 nm , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the barrier widths are @xmath108 nm for both the emitter and the collector and their heights are also the same , @xmath123ev .",
    "the well width is @xmath124 nm . curves show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] correspond to an average over @xmath125 different realizations of the lateral disorder .",
    "the fermi level was fixed at @xmath126mev , the maximum applied bias was @xmath127ev , and @xmath128  nm .",
    "surprisingly , current in disordered dbs is larger than that measured in ordered dbs .",
    "this counterintuitive result can be explained recalling that conductance peak shifted to lower energies , as mentioned above .",
    "the lowering of the conductance peak can be understood assuming that surface roughness makes the effective width of the quantum well larger than its nominal value .",
    "this would imply a lower transmission resonance so the current peak shifts toward lower bias .",
    "but an effective wider well implies a higher current too , so in some statistical sense the current for the disordered dbs will be higher .      up to now we have been considering only lateral uncorrelated roughness at the heterojunctions .",
    "we have also calculated the conductance for a dbs in which interface roughness is an exponentially correlated random variable , as described previously .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the conductance at a given energy about the conductance resonance for the ordered case ( where fluctuations are lower ) , @xmath129 ev , when the correlation length varies several orders of magnitude .",
    "physical parameters of the dbs are the same as in fig .",
    "the size of the islands is @xmath126 nm and the degree of lateral disorder is @xmath113 nm .",
    "an average over 50 realizations of the disorder has been performed .",
    "it can be observed that the conductance increases as the correlation length increases .",
    "two asymptotic regimes are clearly observed for small and large correlation lengths , respectively .",
    "the former limit , @xmath130 , can be understood as the situation previously studied where lateral disorder is uncorrelated . from a closed inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we come to the remarkable result that this uncorrelated limit correctly describes transport properties whenever the correlation length do not exceed @xmath131 nm",
    ". then we are led to an important conclusion , namely those models of electron transport in disordered dbs based on the assumption that disorder is uncorrelated would yield right values of the conductance even if the correlation length is not vanishing but fairly large .",
    "there is no need to mention that uncorrelated disordered models are much more convenient for analytical work than correlated ones .",
    "the size of the plateau for which correlations in the disorder do not play an essential role is governed by the size of the islands , @xmath87 , as might be expected .",
    "this is due to the fact that only correlations of the lateral disorder whose correlation length is greater than the size of the islands affect electron motion . for these sizes",
    ", the conductance increases as the correlation length becomes larger .",
    "this trend is observed up to sizes of the order of @xmath132 nm , namely the system size in the @xmath9 direction , and then the second regime appears . in this regime",
    "the limiting value of the conductance can be calculated as an average over different ordered dbs , each one having barrier widths distributed normally .",
    "having discussed the effects of interface roughness , let us now present our results regarding compositional disorder . to clarify the effects of local fluctuations of the al mole fraction , we assume that the interfaces are perfectly flat and that the width of the different semiconductor layers are exactly their nominal values , i.e. , we neglect fluctuations of their widths .",
    "we show typical results in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where physical parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "the espatial extend of the region where the al mole fraction can be assumed locally constant was taken to be @xmath133 nm and @xmath134 nm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it can be observed that , for fluctuations as large as @xmath135 , that is , height fluctuations of about @xmath117 ev , when averaging over @xmath111 realizations the conductance is almost unchanged ( only 3% variation ) .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the small electron probability amplitudes within the barriers , where compositional disorder is considered to appear . in other words ,",
    "even moderately high spatial inhomogeneities in the barriers scarcely affect the electron envelope function .",
    "thus we can conclude that the effects of compositional disorder can be disregarded as they are much smaller than those of lateral disorder .",
    "in this paper we have presented a method to study electron transport in unintentionally disordered dbs when translational symmetry along the normal plane to the growth direction is broken by structural imperfections .",
    "two different kinds of disorder leading to electron scattering has been presented , namely lateral disorder and compositional disorder .",
    "lateral disorder appears as a consequence of the roughness present at the interfaces between gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as .",
    "compositional disorder is due to the inhomogeneity of the al mole fraction occurring during the growth process of al@xmath0ga@xmath1as epilayers .",
    "we have shown that the main effect of the lateral disorder is to decrease the dbs conductance .",
    "when correlations are introduced , conductance starts improving , the larger the correlation length , the higher the conductance .",
    "however , current shows a surprising behavior , as it is higher in the disordered case than in the ordered one .",
    "we attributed it to an energy shift of the transmission resonance of the dbs .",
    "another important conclusion regards the validity of uncorrelated disordered models ; they provide right values of the conductance whenever the actual correlation length does not exceed the system size , thus allowing a simpler theoretical description .",
    "finally we have shown that the effect of compositional disorder can be disregarded as it is much smaller than the effect of lateral disorder .",
