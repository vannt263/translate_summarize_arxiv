    ", the attractive interaction between the electron and ions emphasizes further the nonlinear dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "the static properties ( electron charge density , electron microfield distribution ) have been discussed in some detail for this case elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", attention is focused on the dynamics via the equilibrium electron electric field autocorrelation function .",
    "this case of electron fields at a positive ion is qualitatively different from same sign ion fields , since in the former case electrons are attracted to the ion leading to strong electron - ion coupling for the enhanced close configurations .",
    "it is difficult _ a priori _ to predict even the qualitative features of the field autocorrelation functions due to this inherent strong electron - ion coupling , and there is no phenomenology for guidance .",
    "consequently , our initial analysis has been based on md simulation of the correlation functions followed by an attempt to model and interpret the observed results .",
    "however , md simulation for the electrons is limited to classical mechanics , while the singular attractive electron - ion interaction inherently requires a quantum mechanical description .",
    "this difficulty is circumvented by modifying the electron - ion coulomb potential at short distances to represent quantum diffraction effects .",
    "the conditions for validity and limitations of this classical model have been discussed extensively elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the details of the md method also have been discussed elsewhere @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "there is a growing recent literature on the related md studies of two - component classical models of a hydrogen plasma @xcite at stronger electron - electron coupling values , but restricted to @xmath2 .",
    "thus the main new feature studied here is the dependence of structure and dynamics on charge number @xmath3    the relevant dimensionless parameters are the charge number of the ion , @xmath1 , the electron - electron coupling constant @xmath4 , and the de broglie wavelength relative to the interelectron distance , @xmath5 . the interelectron distance is defined in terms of the electron density @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "the electron - ion coupling is measured by the maximum value of the magnitude of the regularized electron - ion potential at the origin , @xmath8 .",

    "for the equilibrium state this equation gives the nonlinear boltzmann - poisson equation .",
    "it is mathematically equivalent to the hnc integral equations for an impurity in a one component plasma @xcite , applicable as well for larger @xmath30 , and can be solved numerically in a similar way . however , as noted elsewhere @xcite , these numerical methods fail at very strong coupling @xmath31 . for practical purposes ,",
    "the stationary solution is modelled as a nonlinear debye - huckel distribution with parameters fit to the hnc solution when it exists or by comparison with md simulations otherwise ( a variational method also has been described @xcite but is not used here ) .",
    "the results for equilibrium properties are shown to be quite accurate .",
    "the equilibrium time correlation functions are determined from the linearized vlasov equation ( linear perturbations of the equilibrium state , but still nonlinear in the electron - ion interaction ) .",
    "the results are a composition of correlated initial conditions , fields with single electron trajectories about the ion , and dynamical collective screening by the inhomogeneous electron distribution about the ion .",
    "these results are simplified further by a mean field approximation resulting in a single electron problem in the effective potential of the nonlinear debye distribution .",
    "this analysis is applied to the electric field autocorrelation function showing reasonable agreement with the results from md simulation .",
    "the primary observations from the simulations of the field autocorrelation function for increasing charge number are : 1 ) an increase in the initial value , 2 ) a decrease in the correlation time , and 3 ) an increasing anticorrelation at longer times .",
    "the simple mean field approximation reproduces all of these results .",
    "furthermore , its simplicity allows an interpretation from the single particle motion .",
    "a closely related property is the stopping power for an ion by the electron gas . in the low velocity limit , and for large ion mass , the stopping power is proportional to the time integral of the field autocorrelation function @xcite .",

    "significant deviations from this @xmath32 dependence are observed at strong coupling and have been the focus of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the results here show these deviations come from a competition between the increase of the integral due to 1 ) above and the decrease due to 2 ) and 3 ) .",

    "an extension of the analysis provided here to this atomic physics problem is under way and promises to provide an additional experimental probe for the dynamics of charges near an ion @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description based on the vlasov equation is provided in the next section .",
    "the results are applied to the field autocorrelation function in section 3 .",
    "the stopping power and self - diffusion coefficient are evaluated in section 4 .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion is provided in the last section .",
    "the classical system considered consists of @xmath33 electrons with charge @xmath34 , an infinitely massive positive ion with charge @xmath35 placed at the origin , and a rigid uniform positive background for overall charge neutrality contained in a large volume @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xmath37where @xmath38is the coulomb interaction for electrons @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the regularized electron - ion interaction for electron @xmath42 with the ion , and @xmath43 is the coulomb interaction for electron @xmath42 with the uniform neutralizing background @xmath44 @xmath45 for values of @xmath46 the potential @xmath47 becomes coulomb , while for @xmath48 the coulomb singularity is removed and @xmath49 .",
    "this is the simplest phenomenological form representing the short range effects of the uncertainty principle @xcite . in principle",
    "there should be a similar regularization of the electron - electron interaction , but since that interaction is repulsive configurations with a pair of electrons within a thermal de broglie wavelength are rare . for simplicity , therefore , the electron - electron interaction is taken to be coulomb . in all of the following the electron - electron coupling ( weak ) is measured by @xmath50 while that for the electron - ion coupling ( possibly strong ) is measured by @xmath51 .",
    "the distribution function for the electrons is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "it is normalized such that integration over all velocities and the volume of the system equals @xmath33 .",
    "it obeys the exact first bbgky ( born , bogoliubov , green , kirkwood , yvon ) hierarchy equation @xcite @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the joint distribution function for two electrons . at the weak coupling ( @xmath55 ) the electron distributions are approximately independent and",

    ", the electron ion coupling can be large .",
    "the right side of this equation describes the correlation effects due to interactions among the electrons , which are weak for hot , dense matter .",
    "however , these weak correlations depend nonlinearly on the distribution function so that the content of this equation and its solutions can be quite rich and complex .",
    "the equilibrium state is a stationary solution to ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",

    "it is worth noting that although the electron - electron coupling is weak , the strong ion - electron effects are mediated by the electron - electron interaction of this second term .",
    "the predictions for a free electron gas interacting with an ion are quite different from those given below .",
    "the numerical solutions to ( [ 2.8 ] ) or ( [ 2.8b ] ) and its relationship to the hypernetted chain integral equation at stronger electron coupling has been discussed in reference @xcite . at the weak electron - electron coupling considered here",
    "these equations are the same as the hnc equations , and their solution in the following will be referred to as the hnc result .",
    "an important observation in reference @xcite is that the numerical solution is well represented by the debye form@xmath69 where the effective charge number @xmath70 and screening length @xmath71 are fitting parameters . in the weak coupling domain these become the actual charge number and",

    "more generally , it is only an approximation and the best choices for @xmath70 , @xmath72 are different from @xmath1 , @xmath73 at strong coupling .",

    "the effects of shortening decay time and anti - correlation dominate to decrease the area as indicated in fig .",
    "6 . these effects are greater for stronger coupling , with significant anti - correlation occurring for @xmath117 .",
    "figure 7 shows the same results plotted as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the three cases appear similar , with only a shift in their @xmath118 value due to different values for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this suggests that the time integral of the correlation function , normalized to its value at @xmath118 may be a `` universal '' function of sigma .",
    "to calculate the correlation function and identify the mechanisms for the decay time and correlation , it might be supposed that the single nearest electron dominates since its field is greatest .",
    "figure 8 shows this nearest neighbor contribution from md for the same conditions of fig .",
    "3 .        .",
    "clearly , the nearest neighbor field autocorrelation function has the same qualitative behavior as the total correlation function with respect to the decreasing decay time and increasing anti - correlation .",
    "the quantitative values are wrong ( both amplitude and time scale ) , however , suggesting that contributions from other particles are important as well . to explore this in more detail ,",
    "the vlasov equation given by ( [ 2.19 ] ) can be used .",
    "it requires evaluation of the dynamically screened field @xmath121 , although at short times @xmath122 .",
    "the correlation function is then effectively that for a single particle moving in the self - consistent potential ( [ 2.8b ] ) , averaged over the initial equilibrium distribution of electrons about the ion .",

    "the agreement between this simple theory is quite good and provides a means to interpret the results of the md simulation .",
    "the initial position and velocity of an electron are sampled from the equilibrium distribution @xmath127 which favors electrons close to the ion and hence large fields .",
    "since the force on the electron is also large , its initial acceleration will be large .",
    "this is the source of the short decay time .",
    "consider the case of an energetic electron near the ion .",
    "if its velocity is directed away from the ion it will move to larger distances and the field will decrease with a positive component along the initial field .",
    "in contrast , if its initial velocity is toward the ion it will move past the ion with a change in the direction of its field relative to the initial value .",
    "this is a source for anti - correlation . for less energetic electrons ,",
    "the trajectories are bound and there is continual correlation and anti - correlation as the correlation function decays in magnitude due to phase averaging . both the increase in initial correlation and the field reversal effects should increase as the charge on the ion increases , and this is what is observed . at weaker electron - ion coupling",
    "both effects are diminished and blurred as the relevant configurations are more distant , the fields are weaker , and the accelerations smaller .",
    "this is already evident in the nearest neighbor results of fig .",
    "the simple model of ( [ 4.2 ] ) appears better at larger values of @xmath1 where the single particle motion is expected to dominate . for smaller values of @xmath1",
    "the agreement at short times is still good ( the discrepancy at @xmath128 is a limitation of hnc , not the dynamics ) , but more significant differences occur after the first initial decrease .",
    "presumably , this is due to the dynamical screening effects in @xmath129 that have been neglected .",
    "it should be noted that the results here are somewhat sensitive to the choice of parameters @xmath70 , @xmath72 used in fitting the non - linear debye huckel form for @xmath127 . fits emphasizing short or intermediate distances change slightly the point at which anti - correlation sets in and its amplitude .",
    "the primary criterion used here was a globally good visual fit and a good resulting value for the initial condition @xmath79 .",
    "emphasis here has been placed on the electric field autocorrelation function as a sensitive measure of electron properties near the ion .",
    "this function is also of interest because of its connection to transport and radiative properties of the ion .",
    "specifically , for the case of an infinitely massive ion considered here there are exact relationships between transport coefficients characterizing three physically different phenomena : 1 ) the low velocity stopping power @xmath130 for a particle injected in the electron gas , 2 ) the friction coefficient @xmath131 for the resistance to a particle being pulled through the gas , and 3 ) the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath132 of a particle at equilibrium with the gas @xcite @xmath133 finally , the time integral of @xmath87 also provides the fast fluctuation limit ( impact ) for the spectral line width of ions broadened by electrons @xcite .",
    "clearly , a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the electric field autocorrelation function is of interest in several different contexts .",
    "this green - kubo representation ( [ 5.1 ] ) allows a determination of these transport properties from an equilibrium md simulation , as described above .",
    "in contrast , previous simulations of stopping power have studied the nonequilibrium state of the injected particle , measuring directly the energy degradation @xcite . at asymptotically weak coupling ,",
    "these properties have a dominant @xmath32 dependence , as @xmath87 becomes independent of @xmath1 .",
    "a puzzling result of the previous simulations @xcite , and some experiments @xcite , was the observation of a weaker @xmath1 dependence at strong coupling .",
    "this behavior is somewhat puzzling in light of the strong growth of the initial value @xmath134 at large @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . thus it would appear that the dominant dependence would be an even stronger @xmath135 .",

    "also shown is the born approximation @xmath136 , where the coefficient has been determined by the data for small @xmath1 .",
    "the md data has been fit to a crossover function @xmath137 this form has been chosen since it implies the stopping power goes as @xmath138 at extreme coupling , which is consistent with the earlier results @xcite .",

    "figures 5 and 6 show a quite different behavior at strong coupling where the initial decay time shortens and the anticorrelation becomes prominent on the same time scale .",
