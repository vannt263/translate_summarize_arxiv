    "the counterpart of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , which have x - ray luminosities @xmath2 larger than the eddington luminosity of a stellar mass object of mass @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are not known .",
    "most likely there is no universal engine for ulxs .",
    "some may be powered by anisotropic radiation ( e.g. king et al .",
    "@xcite ; rappaport , podsiadlowski & pfahl @xcite ) or super eddington luminosity ( begelman @xcite ) from stellar mass black holes .    a third possibility is offered by the hypothesised existence of intermediate mass black holes ( ibhs ; see miller & colbert @xcite for a review ) of masses @xmath5 , which could radiate isotropically at a sub - eddington rate to account for the observed luminosities .",
    "there has been some observational evidence that at least some ulxs are powered by ibhs . in some cases the mass - temperature relation ( miller et al .",
    "@xcite ; miller , fabian & miller @xcite ) or quasi periodic oscillations ( fiorito & titarchuk @xcite ; liu et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicate a high accreting mass .",
    "numerical n - body and monte carlo simulations indicate that the stellar collision rate in young dense stellar clusters during core collapse can become very large , giving rise to a hierarchical merger . in that case",
    "an object of thousands of solar masses may form ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; grkan , freitag & rasio @xcite ; freitag , grkan & rasio @xcite ; freitag , rasio , & baumgardt @xcite ) .",
    "the fate of such a massive star is unclear , but it might lead to the formation of an ibh . this scenario is supported by the fact that ulxs correlate positively with star formation ( swartz et al .",
    "@xcite ; liu , bregman & irwin @xcite ) and that some ulxs are associated with stellar clusters ( e.g. zezas et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the young stars in the host cluster of the ibh have strong winds which blow out the gas from the cluster , and there is insufficient free gas available to power a ulx .",
    "however , the ibh can acquire a companion star by dynamical capture or tidal capture . here",
    "we discuss the latter possibility .",
    "hopman , portegies zwart & alexander ( @xcite ) showed that tidal capture of a main sequence star of mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 can lead to circularization close to the tidal radius    @xmath8    which is the distance from the ibh where the tidal forces equal the forces which keep the star bound . as the star evolves it starts to fill its roche lobe causing it to lose mass to the ibh .",
    "this leads to high x - ray luminosities , provided that the donor is sufficiently massive ( @xmath9 , hopman et al .",
    "@xcite ; portegies zwart , dewi , & maccarone @xcite ; li @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , for some ulxs an optical counterpart has been identified , indicating that these ulxs are binary systems ( liu , bregman , & seitzer @xcite ; kuntz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this scenario",
    "a ulx may turn on for at most the life - time @xmath10 of the captured star .",
    "in addition to strong x - ray emission the star emits gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "portegies zwart ( @xcite ) discussed the possibility of observing x - rays and gws simultaneously .",
    "only if the captured star is sufficiently light ( @xmath11 ) , its tidal radius is small enough for it to emit gws in the lisa band during the mass transfer phase ( portegies zwart @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to account for the high ulx luminosities the companion star should be considerably more massive than @xmath12 ( hopman et al .",
    "@xcite ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ; li @xcite ) . in young and dense star clusters",
    "mass segregation causes most massive stars to accumulate in the cluster centre , and the combination of a high mass and large size make these stars excellent candidates for tidal capture .",
    "when after time @xmath13 the massive donor explodes it turns into a compact remnant ( cr ) ; a neutron star ( ns ) or a stellar mass black hole ( sbh ) .",
    "from that moment the ulx , deprived of its source of gas , turns off .",
    "here we focus on the subsequent post supernova evolution of the ( ibh , cr ) binary . in - spiral of the cr into an ibh due to gw emission results in a strong signal in frequencies measurable by space detectors such as lisa , providing a wealth of information about the system ( see miller @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "we show that lisa may be able to observe such ( ibh , cr ) binaries .",
    "when stars orbit ibhs on wide , but highly eccentric orbits , with periapse close to the tidal radius of the ibh , @xmath14 , orbital energy is invested in tidal distortions of the star , causing it to spiral in .",
    "hopman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that if the ibh is less massive than @xmath15 , the star may be able to cool down by radiating the excess energy efficiently , and survive the strong tidal forces .",
    "eventually it circularises near the ibh .",
    "we first estimate the fraction @xmath16 of isolated binaries which merge as a result of gw emission within the age of the universe , while accounting for angular momentum conservation during the mass transfer phase and an isotropic velocity kick .",
    "we then discuss the consequences of the gravitational interaction of cluster stars with the ( ibh , cr ) binary .",
    "after tidal circularization near the ibh , the star may fill its roche lobe , possibly after a period of stellar evolution and expansion .",
    "roche lobe overflow from a @xmath9 donor can then give rise to high luminosities for a time limited by the life - time @xmath17 of the star ( hopman et al .",
    "@xcite ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ; li @xcite ) .",
    "the main - sequence star fills its roche lobe at a distance @xmath18 before the terminal age main sequence .",
    "we assume that the entire hydrogen envelope is transferred to the ibh , while the binary conserves angular momentum .",
    "the mass of the stellar core of the donor star is given by @xmath19 ( iben , tutukov & yungelson @xcite ) , while the mass of the hydrogen envelope is @xmath20 .",
    "angular momentum conservation implies that the binary separation increases during the mass transfer phase .",
    "the remaining helium star subsequently explodes in a super nova after a time @xmath13 , and forms a cr . in this event a star of @xmath21 forms a ns of chandrasekhar mass , @xmath22 .",
    "stars more massive stars than @xmath23 collapse to sbhs ; we assume that the mass distribution is that found by fyer & kalogera ( @xcite ) .",
    "the semi - major axes and eccentricities of the cr are determined by the post mass - transfer orbital elements while accounting for the mass lost in the super nova and for the velocity kick , imparted to the cr at the time of the explosion .",
    "the kick velocity is taken in a random direction with magnitude from the distribution of pulsars velocities , which is well fitted by a double gaussian distribution @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( arzoumanian , chernoff & cordes @xcite ) .",
    "for sbhs we adopt the same distribution , but with velocities smaller by a factor @xmath28 ( white & van paradijs @xcite ; gualandris et al .",
    "the velocity kick leads to an increase of the eccentricity of binary and a change in its energy ; the kicks are generally insufficient to ionise the binary systems ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the surviving binary loses orbital energy due to the emission of gws .",
    "a cr of mass @xmath29 on an orbit with semi - major axis @xmath30 and eccentricity @xmath31 around an ibh of mass @xmath32 loses energy due to the emission of gws at rate of @xmath33 with @xmath34 if the orbit is circular @xmath35 spiral - in occurs on a time - scale of ( peters @xcite ) @xmath36 for non - zero eccentricities the in - spiral time is shorter by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "we perform binary population synthesis with the above described scenario to compute the fraction of high mass binaries that become potential lisa sources .",
    "the mass of the stellar companion was selected from the initial mass function @xmath38 , where we assumed @xmath39 , consistent with the mass function in the core of clusters in which a runaway merger occurred ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "we assume a minimal mass of @xmath40 , since lighter donors can not account for ulx luminosities ( hopman et al .",
    "@xcite ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and a maximal donor mass of @xmath41 .",
    "lisa is likely to observe ( ibh , cr ) binaries in the phase before the merger , rather than the merger event itself .",
    "however , the crs spent only a very short time in the lisa frequency band as compared to the hubble time ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the question whether these sources are detectable therefore depends on how many merge within a the hubble time .    in figures ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] )",
    "we show the results for an ibh of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "only a fraction of the star spirals in within a hubble time .",
    "for @xmath42 nearly all objects which spiral in are nss , with only very few sbhs . for more massive ibhs",
    ", a significant fraction of sbhs also spirals in fast enough , and the total fraction of merging objects exceeds 10% for @xmath44 . in figure([f3 ] ) we show @xmath16 , the fraction of stars which spiral in within the age of the universe , as a function of @xmath45 . after the velocity kick ,",
    "the crs have eccentricities up to @xmath46 .",
    "while this decreases @xmath47 , these eccentricities are much smaller than the @xmath48 eccentricities found by hopman & alexander ( @xcite ) for direct gw capture . by the time the stars spiral in to orbital frequencies @xmath49s , which is in the lisa band , the orbits are close to circular .     as a function of the zero - age main - sequence mass of the donor @xmath50 .",
    "events below the horizontal solid line merge within the age of the universe . for this image we generated 5000 binaries with a @xmath39 power - law initial mass function for the donor mass and we selected an ibh mass of @xmath51 . a small fraction ( 144 or @xmath52% ) of the objects generated experienced merger within a hubble time .",
    "the sudden jump at 20 @xmath53 indicates the transition between ns and sbh formation.[f1 ] ]    . in this case",
    "much more ( @xmath54 ) stars spiral in within the age of the universe , and in particular there is a significant contribution from sbhs .",
    "[ f2 ] ]     of crs which spiral in due to gw emission within the age of the universe as a function of the mass of the ibh .",
    "the error bars are estimated by the 1-@xmath55 poissonian uncertainties of the simulations.[f3 ] ]      the two - body relaxation time @xmath56 of star clusters which host a runaway merger is short ( @xmath57 , portegies zwart & mcmillan @xcite ) , and these evaporate on a time - scale of @xmath58years if tidally limited .",
    "as long as the cluster has not yet evaporated the ( ibh , cr ) binary has interactions with cluster stars . since the ( ibh , cr ) binary is `` hard '' ( heggie @xcite ) ,",
    "these interactions tend to decrease the orbital separation between the ibh and the cr ( miller @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , scattering changes the eccentricity of the binary .",
    "the angular momentum vector @xmath59 of the binary performs a random walk , and its magnitude @xmath60 samples angular momenta @xmath61 on the cluster s relaxation time - scale ( alexander & hopman @xcite ; hopman & alexander @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath62 is the maximum angular momentum of a binary of given energy .",
    "when @xmath60 decreases the orbit becomes more eccentric , and the in - spiral time decreases ( see eq . [ [ eq : t0 ] ] ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to quantify the effect of gravitational two - body scattering , since the cluster is not in a steady state , and in particular the relaxation time in the core can vary wildly . for simplicity",
    "we therefore neglect the effect of scattering in the following discussion on the in - spiral rate and the number of observable lisa sources .",
    "we note , however , that scattering may significantly increase the number of gw sources , so that the following lisa detection rates should be regarded as lower limits .",
    "the dimensionless strain of the gws emitted at a frequency @xmath63 from source at a distance @xmath64 mpc is    @xmath65    ( e.g. sigurdsson & rees @xcite ) .",
    "lisa is sensitive to frequencies in the range @xmath66 hz . at @xmath67",
    "hz , lisa can detect sources with strains larger than @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "this estimate is based on a 1 yr observation with signal - to - noise ratio s / n = 1 ( see , e.g. , http://www.srl.caltech.edu/lisa )",
    ". in the following we assume for concreteness a gw source with frequency @xmath67 hz ; application to other frequencies is straightforward .",
    "sources can be observed to distances up to    @xmath70    we assume that only ulxs with luminosities @xmath71 contain ibhs ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "presently the average number of @xmath72 ulxs per galaxy is @xmath73 ( swartz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the star formation rate dropped by an order of magnitude since @xmath74 ( madau , pozzetti & dickinson @xcite ) .",
    "ulxs correlate with star formation ; here we assume that the number of ulxs is proportional to the star formation rate , in which case the number of luminous ulxs per galaxy at an earlier time was @xmath75 .",
    "since the ulx lives for a time @xmath76 , this yields an ulx formation rate per galaxy of @xmath77 .",
    "as was discussed in the previous section , only a small fraction @xmath78 of the ulxs with @xmath79 leave behind a remnant binary which spirals in within a hubble time .",
    "the rate at which observable gw sources are produced per relic ulx is then    @xmath80    at the point where the period @xmath81 equals @xmath82 , the in - spiral time is @xmath83 where we assumed that the orbit has circularised when the frequency is this high .",
    "we thus find that the mean number of sources emitting gws with frequencies of @xmath84 per galaxy is @xmath85 , or    @xmath86    the local galaxy density is estimated to be @xmath87 ( marinoni et al .",
    "if the maximal distance at which the gw source can be observed is @xmath88 , the number of lisa sources in the sky at any moment is given by @xmath89 , or , using equation ( [ eq : dmax ] ) ,    @xmath90",
    "for ibhs of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and almost no sbhs spiral in ( figure [ [ f1 ] ] ) . the main contribution to",
    "lisa sources comes from nss , i.e. @xmath93.we estimate that the merger rate for nss with ibhs is too low to be likely to be seen by lisa .",
    "however , in this estimate we ignored the effect of three - body scattering on the binary orbit . though hard to quantise , its result may be a marginal detection rate for nss .",
    "we also note that we estimated that sbhs have a velocity kick distribution similar to that of nss , but with velocities smaller by the mass ratio @xmath94 of the objects .",
    "this estimate is rather uncertain , and may be too conservative . larger kick velocities cause more sbhs to merge within a hubble time , in which case the contribution of @xmath91 ibhs to lisa would increase .    for ibhs of @xmath95",
    "we find that @xmath96 and for sbhs @xmath47 decreases to well within a hubble time . in this case stellar mass black holes @xmath97 give the most promising gw sources , with a detection rate of about 10 per year , in the case that three - body scattering is ignored .",
    "including three - body scattering in this estimate may boost the detection rate with a sizable fraction .",
    "our estimate in equation ( [ eq : ntot ] ) for the number of sources that lisa can detect is conservative .",
    "first , in  [ sec : obs ] the ( ibh , cr ) binary is considered to be isolated . indeed",
    "the host cluster eventually evaporates , but this is preceded by a phase during which the binary interacts with other cluster stars (  [ sec : scat ] ) .",
    "these interactions tend to harden the binary , and change its eccentricity . as a result",
    "@xmath47 decreases , and thus the number of potential lisa sources increases . it is not implausible that nearly all ( ibh , cr ) binaries merge within a hubble time , in which case @xmath98 .",
    "second , the life - time of ulxs is probably significantly shorter than the main sequence life - time @xmath13 of the star",
    ". a more realistic assumption would be that ulx luminosities are only achieved when the donor is near the terminal age main sequence , in which case @xmath99 , boosting the predicted detection rate for lisa with an order of magnitude . in conclusion",
    ", the number of observable gw sources could easily be orders of magnitude larger than the expression ( [ eq : ntot ] ) indicates .",
    "previous studies of the number of potential lisa sources from binaries with an extremely small mass ratio focused mainly on cases in which the orbital energy is dissipated by the gws themselves ( e.g. hils & bender @xcite ; sigurdsson & rees @xcite ; ivanov @xcite ; miller @xcite ; freitag @xcite , @xcite ; alexander & hopman @xcite ; hopman & alexander @xcite ) . in that case",
    "the event rate is on the order of a few per gyr , and the orbits are highly eccentric , with typical eccentricities as large as @xmath48 for @xmath100 near an ibh of @xmath101 ( hopman & alexander @xcite ) . in that case",
    "stars spiral in very quickly , and emit gws in the lisa band only for a short time , in contrast to the here discussed tidal capture scenario .",
    "gw sources originating from tidal capture sources have nearly circular orbits when they enter the lisa frequency band , leading to a distinctly different signal than the highly eccentric sources originating from direct capture ( e.g. barack & cutler @xcite ; wen & gair @xcite ) .",
    "lisa can determine both the mass of the ibh and the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "detection of gws from an ibh will give proof of the existence of these objects .",
    "if the signal stems from an orbit with low eccentricity , this supports the scenario that ulxs are accreting ibhs in binary systems .",
