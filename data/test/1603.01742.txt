    "recent numerical simulations @xcite have noticed a sharp steepening in the outer density profiles of dark matter halos , which seems to offer a physical boundary of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "although this steepening feature lies in a low density region in the outskirts of a dark matter halo and thus hard to detect , potential observational evidences have been found by studying the projected number density profiles of galaxies around galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "physically , this steepening feature has been identified with the ` splashback ' of recently accreted dark matter i.e. piling up of dark matter near the first apocenter of its orbit through the halo @xcite . with this physical picture",
    ", @xcite theoretically estimated the radial position of the splashback @xmath7 .",
    "they computed @xmath7 by tracing the trajectory of a dark matter shell accreted onto a dark matter halo and then going through it , and described the dark matter halo with an nfw profile @xcite with its mass increasing with time .",
    "they found good agreement of the predicted splashback radius and the steepening position from the stacked halos in the @xcite simulations .",
    "however , one weakness of their method is that the imposed nfw shape of the halo profile and the trajectories of the dark matter shells are not fully consistent with each other .",
    "although this may not affect their estimation for @xmath7 to a large extent , it prevents them from giving the full shape of the dark matter profile around the splashback radius .",
    "in fact , the steepening feature at halo outskirts has been known for long time in the self - similar spherical collapse model @xcite as associated with the outmost caustic .",
    "in contrast , the caustics in dark matter halos had not been noticed in three - dimensional numerical simulations due to resolution limits until lately when special techniques were applied @xcite . as the outer profiles of dark matter halos are primarily determined by the recent mass accretion , and the matter",
    "there has relatively little participation in the relaxation processes which require numerical simulations to capture , the self - similar spherical collapse model is actually rather adequate in describing the outer profile of dark matter halos .",
    "another merit of the self - similar spherical collapse model is that the halo profile and the trajectories of the dark matter shells are treated consistently with iterations of computing one from the other .",
    "thus we use the self - similar spherical collapse model to compute the outer profiles of dark matter halos .",
    "one obstacle remains still , that the self - similarity is strictly valid only in a universe with no characteristic scales , e.g. an einstein de - sitter ( eds ) universe ( @xmath8 ) as considered in previous studies @xcite .",
    "here we extend the model to a @xmath0cdm universe by relaxing the self - similarity ansatz while keeping its feature of computing trajectories and halo profile in a consistent manner .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sect.[sec : numerical ] we describe the detailed procedures of our computation and the resulting mass and density profiles of dark matter halos",
    ". then we derive analytical interpretations of the results , and provide fitting formulae in sect.[sec : analytical ] , summarise our findings and conclude in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we present the minimalistic dimensionless form of spherical collapse in a @xmath0cdm universe in appendix.[app : spherical_collapse ] , which scales out the cosmology dependence in the variables and has thus greatly reduced our computational cost . with this form",
    ", many relations among the variables as well as the dark matter density profile in the single stream regime of spherical collapse can be expressed in simple analytical forms , which we show in appendices.[app : eqs ] and [ app : single ] .",
    "finally , in appendix.[app : splashback_eds ] we present a physical estimation of the splashback radius in an eds universe .",
    "we look for the asymptotic profile of dark matter halos as a function of their mass accretion rate and the background cosmology . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict ourselves to a flat @xmath0cdm universe with @xmath9 , and study the case of power law mass growth @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "thus , the two basic parameters in our study are the mass accretion rate @xmath12 and the dimensionless matter density of the universe @xmath13 .",
    "power law mass growth is typical for dark matter halos in our universe at low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the typical mass growth rate is @xmath14 for galaxy mass halos today , and increases with redshift and halo mass .",
    "following @xcite , we use the mass enclosed by the shell that has collapsed to half of its turn - around radius @xmath15 under no shell - crossing as a proxy for the virial mass @xmath16 of the halo .",
    "this matches the early definition of virial radius in a spherical collapse model @xcite . with this definition ,",
    "the relative sizes of dark matter shells are specified by their dimensionless trajectories ( appendix.[app : spherical_collapse ] ) when the mass growth history is given .        in a multi - stream region such as a dark matter",
    "halo , the dark matter trajectory depends on the halo mass profile and vice versa , thus an iteration is needed in computing the two . under strict self - similarity , the trajectory of one dark matter shell also represents the locations of all dark matter shells in a snapshot , and thus within each iteration , only one integration of orbit is needed . in a @xmath0cdm universe ,",
    "we lose such simplification , and need to compute the trajectories of the dark matter shells accreted at different times simultaneously . to reduce this computational cost ,",
    "we simplify the spherical collapse equations to a minimalistic dimensionless form ( appendix.[app : spherical_collapse ] ) .",
    "the loss of strict self - similarity also means that the mass profile is time dependent .",
    "luckily , in our universe where the dark energy is still not entirely dominating , this time dependence is mild and slow - on the timescale of change of @xmath13 , see fig.[fig : mprof_omm ] . over a dynamical time which is shorter compared to this timescale",
    ", the mass profile can be approximated as being constant .",
    "therefore , we parametrize the mass in the multi - stream region as @xmath19 , with an initial choice of @xmath20 . then we compute the trajectories of the shells till the time the halo is observed , which is specified by the value of @xmath21 . using the trajectories we update the form of mass profile to @xmath22 ,",
    "compute the trajectories again , and iterate . the mass profile and trajectories converge quickly with the number of iterations @xmath23 ( fig.[fig : iter ] ) . as shown by fig.[fig : mprof_omm ] , the shape of the mass profile scaled to @xmath24 is indeed only slightly time - dependent , even over a long time range indicated by the change of the matter content of the universe @xmath25 .",
    "how do different mass profiles affect the position of splashback ? we assess this by generalising the @xcite method : tracing the trajectory of one dark matter shell through a growing dark matter halo with an nfw profile , to dark matter halos with different mass profiles ( upper panel of fig.[fig : sp ] ) .",
    "the mass profiles considered are constructed to have the same value and slope at @xmath26 , but different inner slopes .",
    "the mass profile slope at @xmath26 is derived from the fillmore & goldreich formula ( eq.[eq : gamval ] ) and thus is similar to that of our self - similar solutions without the saturation at @xmath27 . to differentiate the two",
    ", we refer to our reproduced result as ` result from the adhikari et al .",
    "method ' . matching the mass profile slope of @xmath28 without a saturation to an nfw halo would lead to unrealistically small concentration parameters at relatively large mass accretion rates , e.g. @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and significantly smaller @xmath31 there . ] .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 as a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath12 and the redshift , or more precisely , the matter content of the universe at the time of observation @xmath21 is shown as lines with different line - styles in the middle panel of fig.[fig : sp ] .",
    "the difference between them presents the degree of influence of different mass profiles , while the difference between the solid lines and the stars ( our self - similar result ) presents that of the different theoretical assumptions of adhikari et al . and our self - similar approach . both effects matter to similar degree .",
    "different mass profiles affect @xmath31 not only through different gravitational dynamics they lead to , but also simply from the radius - overdensity conversion . to reduce the second effect , we present the comparison again in terms of @xmath32 ( lower panel of fig.[fig : sp ] ) . in terms of @xmath32 ,",
    "the splashback locations predicted with different mass profiles differ much less .",
    "therefore , we recommend to use this representation to compare with simulations and observations . in this representation ,",
    "the result from the self - similar solution and that from the adhikari et al .",
    "method agree to better than 10% for all mass accretion rates examined when @xmath33 ."
