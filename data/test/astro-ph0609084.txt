    "the primary mass loss diagnostic used in these analyses is p  v  @xmath1 .",
    "although wind models predict that the ion fraction of p@xmath2 should approach 100% in the winds of mid- to late o stars , this is a na - like ion , and can be quite fragile .",
    "consequently , it is important to verify the results based on p  v.",
    "like phosphorus , sulfur is a non - cno element with a relatively low cosmic abundance .",
    "three sulfur mass loss diagnostics are available : the s  iv  @xmath3  1062 , 1072 and s  vi  @xmath4  933 , 944 resonance doublets , and the s  v  @xmath5  1502 excited state line  populated by the s  v  @xmath5  786 resonance line .",
    "for wind conditions , the lower level of 1502  is populated exclusively by radiative excitation . in this case ,",

    "s  iv , s  v and s  vi occur together in luminous o4  o 6 stars with massive winds . s  v was analyzed in both lmc and galactic stars , using the sei code ( lamers et al . , 1987 ) and",

    "preliminary sulfur results give _ total _ sulfur mass loss rates , @xmath10 , between 0.04  0.18 times smaller than those expected from either theoretical ( vink et al .",
    "2000 ) or radio or h@xmath11 determinations ( see , fullerton et al .",
    "these results are similar those determined by the p  v analyses .",
    "clumping and porosity can influence the results , and must be incorporated into the analysis to determine exact factors .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the mass loss rates of o stars will have to be revised downward by some amount .",
    "we intend to extend the current analysis to a much larger sample and to investigate the effects of clumping more closely .",
