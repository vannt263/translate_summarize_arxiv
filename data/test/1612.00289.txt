    "tremendous progress has been realized in the last decades concerning the theoretical foundation of quantum optics in dielectric media . while the historical approach proposed by jauch and watson  @xcite was already based on the standard canonical quantization formalism for fields , it neglected dispersion and dissipation which are intrinsic properties of any causal dielectric media satisfying kramers krnig relations . since then",
    "several important studies were devoted to the extension of the method to inhomogeneous and artificially structured media which are central issues in modern micro and nano photonics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical approaches adapted to transparent but dispersive media with negligible losses have been also developed based on different techniques such as the slowly varying envelope approximation  @xcite or the quasi modal expansion method which is valid near resonance for polaritons  @xcite .",
    "more recently , losses were included in the theory by adding phenomenologically some optical dissipation channels in the light propagation path  @xcite .",
    "such a method was successfully used for the modeling of casimir forces in dissipative media  @xcite and surface plasmon polaritons  @xcite .",
    "+ moreover , the most fundamental progress was probably done when huttner and barnett , and others  @xcite proposed a self - consistent canonical quantization procedure for an homogeneous and causal dielectric medium by coupling photonic degrees of freedom with mechanical oscillator variables acting as thermal baths .",
    "the method , based on the pioneer works by fano and hopfield @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , was subsequently extended to several inhomogeneous systems including anisotropic and magnetic properties  @xcite . in parallel to these theoretical works based on the standard canonical quantization method , a different and powerful axis of research appeared after the work by gruner and welsch  @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) based on the quantum langevin noise approach used in cavity qed ( i.e. , quantum electrodynamics )  @xcite .",
    "the method is also known as the green tensor method  @xcite since it relies on efficient green dyadic techniques used nowadays in nano - photonics and plasmonics  @xcite .",
    "this ` langevin - noise ' approach , which actually extends earlier ` semi classical ' researches based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem by lifshitz and many others in the context of casimir and optical forces  @xcite , was successfully applied in the recent years to many issues concerning photonics  @xcite and nano - plasmonics where dissipation can not be neglected  @xcite . in this context",
    "the relationship between the huttner - barnett approach on the one side and the langevin noise method on the other side has attracted much attention in the last years , and several works attempted to demonstrate the validity of the langevin noise method from a rigorous hamiltonian perspective which is more in a agreement with the canonical huttner - barnett approach  @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this work is to revisit these derivations of the equivalence between the langevin noise and hamitonian method and to show that some unphysical assumptions actually limit the domain of validity of the previous attempts .",
    "more precisely , as we will show in this work , the analysis and derivations always included some hypothesis concerning causality and boundary conditions which actually lead to circularity in the deductions and are not applicable to the most general inhomogeneous systems used in nano - optics .",
    "specifically , these derivations , like the fluctuation - dissipation reasoning in lifshitz and rytov works  @xcite , give too much emphasis on the material origin of quantum fluctuations for explaining macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in continuous media .",
    "however , as it was already pointed out in the 1970 s  @xcite , one must include with an equal footings both field and matter fluctuations in a self consistent qed hamiltonian in order to preserve rigorously unitarity and causality  @xcite . while this does nt impact too much the homogeneous medium case considered by huttner and barnett  @xcite it is crucial to analyze further the inhomogeneous medium problem in order to give a rigorous foundation to the gruner and welsch theory  @xcite based on fluctuating currents .",
    "this is the central issue tackled in the present work .",
    "+ the layout of this paper is as follows : in section ii we review the lagrangian method developed in our previous work  @xcite based on an alternative dual formalism for describing the huttner - barnett model . in this section",
    "we summarize the essential elements of the general lagrangian and hamiltonian model necessary for the present study .",
    "in particular we present the fundamental issue about the correct definition of hamiltonian which will be discussed at length in this article . in section iii",
    "we provide a quantitative discussion of the huttner - barnett model for an homogeneous dielectric medium .",
    "we discuss a modal expansion into plane waves and separate explicitly the electromagnetic field into classical eigenmodes and noise related langevin s modes .",
    "we show that both contributions are necessary for preserving unitarity and time symmetry .",
    "we consider limit cases such as the ideal hopfield - fano polaritons @xcite without dissipation and the weakly dissipative polariton modes considered by milonni and others  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of the hamiltonian of the whole system and interpret the various contributions with respect to the langevin noise method and to the loss - less hopfield - fano limit . in section",
    "iv we generalize our analysis to the inhomogeneous medium case by using a green dyadic formalism in both the frequency and time domain .",
    "we demonstrate that in general it is necessary to keep both pure photonic and material fluctuations to preserve the unitarity and time symmetry of the quantum evolution .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about the physical meaning of the hamiltonian in presence of inhomogeneities and interpret the various terms associated with photonic and material modes .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we developed a new lagrangian formalism adapted to qed in dielectric media without magnetic properties . here we will use this model to derive our approach but a standard treatment based on the minimal coupling scheme  @xcite or the power - zienau  @xcite transformation would lead to similar results .",
    "we start with the dual lagrangian density : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the magnetic and displacement fields respectively . in this formalism",
    "the usual magnetic potential @xmath3 , defined such as @xmath4 , is replaced by the dual electric potential @xmath5 ( in the ` coulomb ' gauge @xmath6 ) defined by @xmath7 implying @xmath8 the material part @xmath9 of the lagrangian density in eq .",

    "[ 1 ] includes a term @xmath18 which is necessary for the derivation of the dynamical laws for the material fields @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "we therefore have @xmath34 which is reminiscent of the general linear response theory used in thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the term @xmath35 can be seen as an induced dipole density .",
    "however , as we will show in the next section the electric field itself is decomposed into a purely fluctuating term @xmath36 and a scattered field @xmath37 which depends on the density @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the contribution @xmath35 to @xmath39 is also decomposed into a pure photon - fluctuation term @xmath40 and an induced term @xmath41 related to material fluctuations @xmath38 .",
    "+ importantly , the linear susceptibility @xmath42 which is defined by @xmath43 characterizes completely the dispersive and dissipative dielectric medium .",
    "we can show that the permittivity @xmath44 is an analytical function in the upper part of the complex plane @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 , provided @xmath42 is finite for any time @xmath47 . from this",
    "we deduce the symmetry @xmath48 and it is possible to derive the general kramers - krnig relations existing between the real part @xmath49\\equiv\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}'(\\mathbf{x},\\omega)$ ] and the imaginary part @xmath50\\equiv\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}''(\\mathbf{x},\\omega)$ ] of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "therefore , the huttner - barnett model characterized by the conductivity @xmath51 is fully causal and can be applied to describe any inhomogeneous dielectric media in the linear regime .",
    "+ the central issue of the present paper concerns the definition of the hamiltonian @xmath52 in the huttner - barnett model .",

    "+ however , hutner and barnett  @xcite after diagonalizing their hamiltonian found that the total evolution is described in the homogeneous medium case by @xmath57 while as we will see this is actually a correct description ` for all practical purpose ' in a homogeneous dissipative medium for large class of physical boundary conditions , this is in general not acceptable in order to preserve time - symmetry and unitarity in the full hilbert space for interacting matter and light . the general method based on langevin forces and noises avoided quite generally mentioning that difficult point .",
    "we emphasize that while the conclusions presented in refs .",
    "@xcite is accepted by more or less all authors on the subject  @xcite they have been some some few dissident views ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) claiming , that in the context of an input - output formalism , the langevin noise formalism is not complete unless we consider as well fluctuations of the free photon modes ( see also the replies with an opposite perspective in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present work we will generalize and give a rigrous qed like hamiltonian foundations to the prescriptions of refs .",
    "@xcite and we will show that it is actually necessary to include a full description of photonic and material quantum excitations in order to preserve unitarity . in order to appreciate this fact further we will first consider the problem associated with quantization of the electromagnetic field .",
    "we first introduce the paradigmatic homogeneous medium case considered initially by huttner and barnett  @xcite , i.e. , with @xmath58 .",

    "the method followed here is to consider the forward laplace transform of the different evolution equations ( such an approach was also used by suttorp by mixing both forward and backward laplace s transforms  @xcite ) . to deal with this problem we first change the time @xmath75 variable in @xmath76 and define @xmath77 .",

    "the @xmath88 contribution corresponds to what classically we call a sum of eigenmodes supported by the medium ( i.e. with @xmath89 ) while the @xmath90 term is the fluctuating field generated by the langevin source @xmath91 .",

    ", the most important finding of the present article concerns the comparisons between the generalized huttner - barnett approach , advocated here , which involves both photonic and material independent degrees of freedom , and the langevin - noise method proposed initially by gruner and welsch  @xcite which involves only the material degrees of freedom associated with fluctuating currents .",
    "we showed that rigorously speaking the langevin - noise method is not equivalent to the full hamiltonian qed evolution coupling photonic and material fields . only in the regime where the dissipation of the bulk surrounding medium is non vanishing at spatial infinity could we ,",
    "i.e. , for all practical purposes , identify the two theories .",
    "however , even with such assumptions the langevin noise model is breaking time - symmetry since it considers only decaying modes while the full hamiltonian theory used in our work accepts also growing waves associated with anti - thermodynamic processes .",
    "we claim that this is crucial in nanophotonics / plasmonics where quantum emitters , spatially localized , are coupled to photonic and material modes available in the complex environment , e.g. , near nano - antennas in vacuum ( i.e. in a spatial domain where losses are vanishing at infinity ) . since most studies consider the interaction between molecules or quantum - dots and plasmon / polaritons using the langevin noise approach we think that it is urgent to clarify and clean up the problem by analyzing the coupling regime using the full hamiltonian evolution advocated in the present work . finally , we suggest that this work could impact the interpretation and discussion of pure qed effects such as the casimir force or the lamb shift which are strongly impacted by polariton and plasmon modes . all this will be the subject for future works and therefore the present detailed analysis is expected to play an important role in nanophotonics and plasmonics for both the classical and quantum regimes .",
