    "a very important issue in probability theory and statistics is whether or not the central limit theorem holds , that is , if we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the standard normal distribution function .",
    "going one step further , we can ask ourselves about the possible rate of convergence in ( [ eqclt ] ) , more precisely , if it holds that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a probability metric , @xmath17 follows a standard normal distribution and  @xmath18 denotes the probability measure induced by the random variable @xmath19 .",
    "the rate @xmath20 can be considered as a measure of reliability for statistical inference based on @xmath21 , and large rates are naturally preferred .",
    "the question of rate of convergence has been addressed under numerous different setups with respect to the metric and underlying structure of the sequence @xmath9 in the literature .",
    "perhaps one of the most important metrics is the kolmogorov ( uniform ) metric , given as @xmath22 the latter has been studied extensively in the literature under many different notions of ( weak ) dependence for @xmath23 .",
    "one general way to measure dependence is in terms of various mixing conditions . in the case of the uniform metric",
    ", bolthausen @xcite and rio @xcite showed that it is possible to obtain the rate @xmath24 in ( [ eqcltrateks ] ) , given certain mixing assumptions and a bounded support of the underlying sequence @xmath9 ; see also @xcite , among others , for related results and extensions . under the notion of @xmath25-mixing ,",

    "another stream of significant works focuses on stationary ( causal ) bernoulli - shift processes , given as @xmath28 the study of ( [ eqcltrateks ] ) given the structure in ( [ eqstructurecondition ] ) has a long history , and dates back to kac @xcite and postnikov @xcite .",

    "a similar reasoning applies to @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately though , setting this idea to work leads to rather intricate problems , and a technique like that of tikhomirov @xcite is not fruitful , inevitably leading to a suboptimal rate .",
