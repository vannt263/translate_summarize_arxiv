    "cosmic ray interactions at ultra - high energies offer unique insights into particle collisions at center - of - mass energies exceeding 100  tev . due to their very small flux at these energies , cosmic rays",
    "can only be detected indirectly via the extensive air showers ( eas ) they induce in the atmosphere .",
    "hence , in order to infer the mass and energy of the primary cosmic rays as well as to gain insight into the physics of the high - energy collisions , one has to rely on detailed simulations of air showers . for this purpose , hadronic multiparticle production has to be simulated at energies exceeding by far those accessible at man - made accelerators and in phase space regions not covered in collider experiments .",
    "the secondary muons produced in these collisions which can be detected directly on ground , are a tracer of high - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "for this reason , the number of muons produced in simulated air showers depends strongly on the adopted hadronic interaction models @xcite . in addition , muons are a sensitive indicator of the primary composition , as , for example , iron showers produce about 40% more muons than protons .    in this work",
    "we will employ _ air shower universality _ in order to determine the number of muons in air showers detected with auger , using several independent methods .",
    "air shower universality @xcite states that the average properties of air showers can be completely characterized by the primary energy , stage of shower evolution , and overall muon normalization , when viewing the shower around or after shower maximum . in particular , the electromagnetic particle content of the shower is already determined by its energy and stage of evolution .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that the electromagnetic cascade involves dozens of particle generations and of order @xmath0 particles , which washes out the details of high - energy hadronic interactions .    in order to infer the muon density of showers at a given energy",
    ", one has to rely on an energy scale of the surface detector . using the universality of the electromagnetic contribution to the signal measured by the auger surface detectors , @xmath1 , we are able to determine an energy scale independent of the fluorescence energy measurement",
    ". the muon density at ground which we infer using the surface detector and , independently , using hybrid events , does not rely on assumptions on the primary cosmic ray composition .",
    "this allows for a direct test of the predictions of hadronic interaction models .",
    "universality features of the longitudinal profile of showers have been studied by several authors . here",
    "we exploit shower universality features to predict the surface detector signal expected for auger cherenkov tanks from the electromagnetic and muonic shower components at 1000 m from the shower core . in the following ,",
    "we give a brief outline of the parameterization . for a detailed description ,",
    "see @xcite .    a library of proton and iron showers covering the energy range from @xmath2 to @xmath3ev and",
    "zenith angles between @xmath4 and @xmath5 was generated with corsika 6.5 @xcite and the hadronic interaction models qgsjet ii.03 @xcite and fluka @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "a smaller set of showers was simulated with the combinations qgsjet ii.03/gheisha @xcite and sibyll 2.1/fluka @xcite .",
    "seasonal models of the malarge molecular atmosphere were used @xcite .",
    "the detector response is calculated using look - up tables derived from a detailed geant4 simulation of the auger surface detectors , which has been shown to match the data well @xcite .",
    "note that since the auger detectors are calibrated against the cosmic ray muon background , we only rely on the correct simulation of the signal generated by electromagnetic particles relative to that of the muons .",
    "air shower universality states that the electromagnetic component of the predicted surface detector signal @xmath1 at the lateral distance of 1000 m depends only on primary energy and the stage of shower evolution , and not on the primary particle and hadronic model assumed .",
    "we define the electromagnetic component of the signal as that of electrons , positrons , and gamma rays excluding muon decay products , and measure shower evolution in terms of the distance between the shower maximum and the ground @xmath6 , measured along the shower axis .",
    "in fact , universality is slightly violated , and the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath1 of proton and iron showers differ by about 12% @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sparam ] . the dependence on the hadronic model is much smaller , about 5% .",
    "+     the muon contribution to @xmath1 , which includes muon decay products in our definition , depends strongly on the primary particle ( 40% difference between proton and iron ) and the hadronic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sparam ] ) .",
    "however , the functional dependence on @xmath7 is universal .    after accounting for geometrical effects such as the projected tank surface area ,",
    "the electromagnetic shower signal ( averaged over proton and iron ) is parameterized as function of the energy @xmath8 , distance to shower maximum @xmath7 , and zenith angle @xmath9 .",
    "the difference between proton and iron shower profiles is included in the calculation of the systematic uncertainties later on .",
    "similarly , the universal shape of the muon signal profile is parameterized simultaneously using a gaisser - hillas function for all models and primaries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sparam ] ) , leaving only normalization factors free .",
    "the expected detector signal at 1000 m can then be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the parametrized muon signal adopting the normalization for proton - qgsjet ii at 10eev , so that @xmath12 is the number of muons relative to that of qgsjet - ii proton showers at 10eev .",
    "within the current statistics , the arrival directions of high - energy cosmic rays around 10  eev are found to be isotropic , allowing us to apply the _ constant intensity _",
    "method to determine the muon signal contribution . dividing the surface detector data into equal exposure bins , the number of showers with @xmath1 greater than a given threshold @xmath13",
    ", should be the same for each bin .",
    "@xmath14 using the independently measured mean depth of shower maximum @xmath15 @xcite , the only remaining free parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cic - muons ] ) is the relative number of muons @xmath12 . for a given energy @xmath8",
    ", @xmath12 is adjusted to obtain a flat distribution of events in @xmath16 .    more precisely , scanning through a range of @xmath12 values",
    ", we calculate the @xmath17/dof of the event histogram relative to a flat distribution in @xmath16 .",
    "we then fit a two - branch parabola around the minimum of @xmath18 , which results in a best - fit @xmath19 and its asymmetric error , @xmath20 .",
    "the sensitivity of this method to the muon number parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1000 ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cic - results ] . clearly , @xmath21 ( top histogram in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cic - results ] ) is ruled out by the data .",
    "the best description of the data above 10eev requires @xmath22",
    ". however , we have to take into account shower - to - shower fluctuations and the finite resolution of @xmath1 which lead to a slightly biased @xmath12 measurement in this method .",
    "in order to estimate this bias , we have simulated a large number of monte carlo realizations of sd data sets of the same size as the auger data set , distributed according to the observed cosmic ray spectrum and assuming different primary compositions ( pure proton , iron , or mixed composition ) , and different `` true '' @xmath12 .",
    "for each shower , @xmath23 is obtained from distributions which closely match the observed @xmath23 distributions in the fluorescence data .",
    "the electromagnetic and muon signals are fluctuated according to the model predictions @xcite .",
    "note that the magnitude of fluctuations in @xmath23 and @xmath12 are robust predictions which only depend on the primary particle .",
    "( [ eq : s1000 ] ) is then used to calculate the signal at 1000 m from the shower core , @xmath1 , which is smeared with an experimental reconstruction accuracy @xcite .",
    "a realistic trigger probability is also applied .    for each simulated data set",
    ", we then apply exactly the same analysis as used on the real data .",
    "we found that @xmath12 is systematically _ overestimated _ by 3@xmath246% .",
    "this bias is due to a combined action of shower - to - shower fluctuations and detector resolution which depends on the signal size .",
    "we have found that the bias in @xmath12 is independent of the `` true '' value of @xmath12 adopted , and primarily depends on the size of reconstruction uncertainties on @xmath1 and the primary composition .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the relative bias on @xmath12 as a function of primary energy , for different assumed compositions and increased / decreased detector resolution . clearly , the bias is quite robust to rather extreme changes in those assumptions .",
    "we then subtract the bias expected for a mixed composition ( black dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] ) from the measured @xmath19 , obtaining a corrected @xmath12 of : @xmath25 three main sources of systematics enter in the determination of @xmath12 using the constant intensity method : the uncertainty on the electromagnetic signal due to universality violation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : univ ] ) ; the uncertainty on @xmath26 at this energy ; and the uncertainty on the bias of @xmath12 determined from the monte carlo simulations .    in order to quantify the first two systematics , we measure @xmath12 using an electromagnetic signal rescaled by @xmath276% , bracketing the observed universality violation , and measuring @xmath12 with varying @xmath26 , adopting the systematic and statistical uncertainty reported by auger @xcite . for the uncertainty on the bias ,",
    "we adopt @xmath28% . summing the different contributions in quadrature",
    ", we obtain the total systematic error on @xmath12 quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmucic ] ) .",
    "once @xmath12 at 10  eev is measured , and using the measured mean depth of shower maximum , the signal size at @xmath29 can be calculated : @xmath30 within the uncertainties , this value of @xmath31 is consistent with the energy scale from fluorescence detector measurements , whose systematic uncertainty ( 22% @xcite ) is dominated by the uncertainty on the fluorescence yield .",
    "( [ eq : energy - scale ] ) corresponds to assigning showers a @xmath32% higher energy than done in the fluorescence detector - based auger shower reconstruction ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the pierre auger observatory has the unique capability of measuring hybrid events which have been simultaneously detected by the surface detector array and fluorescence telescopes . for each of these events , a calorimetric measurement of the energy @xmath8 and depth of shower maximum",
    "@xmath23 are available , in addition to the signal @xmath1 from the surface array .",
    "hence , we can use our parameterization of the universal electromagnetic signal @xmath34 to determine the electromagnetic contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "the remainder of the signal is attributed to muons , and we can determine a muon normalization for each event : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is again the reference muon signal ( proton - qgsjetii at 10  eev ) .",
    "we select high - quality hybrid events for which the shower maximum is in the field of view of a telescope , @xmath37 , and the mie scattering length is measured .",
    "furthermore , the cherenkov light fraction is limited to less than 50% , and we apply all cuts used in the measurement of the elongation rate @xcite which have been carefully chosen in order to ensure an unbiased @xmath23 distribution of the air showers . the surface detector event has to satisfy the t5 selection cuts which are also applied in @xcite .        the average muon normalization in hybrid events at 10eev is found to be @xmath38 in excellent agreement with the constant intensity method results , when compared at the same energy scale .    a similar study has been performed for inclined hybrid events ( @xmath39 ) . while the statistics are limited , no subtraction of @xmath40 is necessary for these events , as the electromagnetic part has been attenuated in the large depth of atmosphere traversed .",
    "thus , inclined hybrid events yield a clean measurement of @xmath12 , and good agreement between muon numbers of the inclined and the vertical data sets is found .",
    "[ fig : hybrid - muons ] shows the muon signal derived from the hybrid events as a function of shower evolution ( @xmath7 ) . while the muon signal is clearly higher than that predicted in the simulations , the behavior as a function of @xmath7 follows the prediction very well , which serves as a consistency test of our method .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we compare the results of the different methods applied for inferring the muon density at 1000 m from the shower core .",
    "the relative number of muons is shown as function of the adopted energy scale with respect to the auger fluorescence detector energy reconstruction .",
    "only the constant intensity method yields an independent measurement of the energy scale .",
    "good agreement between the presented methods is found , when compared at @xmath41 .",
    "assuming air shower universality , which was tested with simulations of various primaries and hadronic interaction models , we have determined the muon density at 10  eev and the energy scale with which the data of the pierre auger observatory can be described self - consistently .",
    "the number of muons measured in data is about 1.5 ( 1.7 ) times larger than that predicted by qgsjet ii ( sibyll ) for proton showers , with statistical and systematic errors of the order of 0.1 .",
    "this value of @xmath12 is even slightly larger than that predicted for iron showers , by a factor of 1.1 and 1.2 for qgsjetii and sibyll , respectively .",
    "a similar excess has been found at energies from 3  eev to 50  eev .",
    "consistent results were obtained with several analysis methods on independent data sets : the constant intensity method ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cic ] ) uses only the surface detector data and is independent of the fluorescence energy scale . vertical hybrid events ( sec .  [ sec : hybrid ] ) allow for a direct and unbiased measurement of @xmath12 for each event , albeit depending on the flourescence energy .",
    "the signal in inclined hybrid events ( @xmath42 ) is purely muonic , and the resulting @xmath12 independent of the subtraction of the electromagnetic signal .",
    "the fact that all three methods agree within errors for an energy scale of @xmath43 indicates that increasing the number of muons by 50% ( relative to proton - qgsjetii ) yields a consistent description of the auger data .",
    "if interpreted in terms of cosmic ray composition , the derived muon density would correspond to nuclei heavier than iron , which is clearly at variance with the measured @xmath44 values at this energy .",
    "the discrepancy between air shower data and simulations reported here is qualitatively similar to the inconsistencies found in composition analyses of previous detectors @xcite .",
    "this points towards a deficiency of hadronic models in predicting the number of muons produced in air showers at large distances from the shower core . however , it is important to note that the method presented here relies on a correct description of the electromagnetic shower component in the simulations .",
