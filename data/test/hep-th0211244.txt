    "the weak energy condition of general relativity , the requirement that there be no negative energy densities , is sufficient to prevent the appearance of exotic features such as compactly generated closed timelike curves @xcite and superluminal travel @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory appears to violate this condition , however .",
    "one example is the standard casimir system of parallel plates , for which there is a negative energy density between the plates .",
    "however , this is an idealized system , which assumes a perfect conductor with an infinitely sharp and flat edge .",
    "a real material will have a rough surface at the atomic scale and will also appear transparent to very high energy modes .",
    "since the casimir energy is a sum over all energies , it will always include modes for which these effects are relevant , so this idealization could affect the value of the sum .",
    "in addition , since the boundary condition is imposed externally , there is no measure of the energy that would be required to maintain it .",
    "although there are other ways to produce negative energy densities , for example a superposition of states with zero and two photons , these cases are constrained by averaged energy conditions , which require the energy to be positive when averaged along an entire geodesic .",
    "they are also constrained by quantum inequalities @xcite , which limit the total negative energy that can exist when averaging over a certain period of time .",
    "thus it is important to understand problems of the casimir type if we want to know whether quantum field theory protects general relativity against negative energies .    in this paper , we reconsider the question of the energy density in such systems . to avoid the subtleties associated with the casimir problem",
    ", we consider a quantum field in the presence of a background potential ( i.e. , a field with a mass that depends on position ) .",
    "in such an approach , one can choose a potential that depends only on one spatial dimension , and simulate the parallel plates in the casimir problem . by generalizing the approach of @xcite to local densities",
    ", we can precisely cancel the divergences in the calculation in a definite renormalization scheme .",
    "@xcite considered similar problems for the special case of reflectionless potentials , such as the potentials for the supersymmetric kink and sine - gordon models . here",
    "we present a general approach suitable for numerical computation , in addition to analytic calculations in exactly solvable models @xcite .",
    "these techniques are also useful for the study of casimir forces and stresses @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our method , we will first consider a simple model .",
    "we take a real , massless scalar field in 2 + 1 dimensions in the background of a repulsive potential @xmath1 that depends on one spatial dimension but not the other .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian density = 12and expand the field @xmath2 in terms of small oscillations , giving ( x , y , t ) = _ -^ _ 0^_=+ , - ( _ k^(x ) e^ipy e^-i(p ) ta_k , p^+_k^(x)^e^-ipy e^i(p ) ta^_k , p^ ) . where @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 are normal mode wave functions , which can be taken to be real .",
    "the sum is over the symmetric mode , @xmath5 , and the antisymmetric mode , @xmath6 .",

    "k^-(x ) = 0 _ = + , - _ -^dx _",
    "k^(x ) = 2(k - k ) , which gives @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the solutions in the free case , @xmath10 .",
    "the energy density is then = _ -^ _ 0^_=+ , - 12 .",

    "( [ eqn : eom ] ) to obtain = _ -^ _ 0^_=+ , - .",
    "the integral is highly divergent , but by using dimensional regularization and introducing counterterms into the hamiltonian , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we can render the integral finite .",
    "we then integrate out the transverse modes , giving _ = - _ 0^ _ = + , - \\{&&^n+1 & & + n+14^n-1d^2dx^2(_k^(x)^2 ) } , where @xmath11 is the number of transverse dimensions , later to be set to 1 .",
    "the hamiltonian has been renormalized by subtracting a constant term for the vacuum energy and a term proportional to the potential , which is sufficient to render it finite in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we can relate the norms of the mode wavefunctions to the green s function by ( see for example @xcite ) _",
    "= + , -_k^(x)^2 = 2k g(x , x , k ) , where @xmath12 is the green s function , which satisfies -g(x , x,k ) + v(x)g(x , x,k ) - k^2g(x , x,k ) = ( x - x ) and has only outgoing waves ( @xmath13 ) at infinity .",
    "the green s function has the symmetry property @xmath14 , so for real @xmath15 we can write _",
    "= + , -_k^(x)^2 = kig(x , x , k)-ki g ( x , x , -k ) .",
    "thus we can compute the energy by extending the range of integration to @xmath16 , and using @xmath17 , _ = - _ -^^n+1 dk , [ eqn : contourextend ] where , since we are taking the massless limit , @xmath18 .",
    "next we would like to convert this expression into a contour integral by closing the contour at infinity in the upper half plane .",
    "the contour at infinity does not contribute , because for large , positive @xmath19 , g(x , x , k ) 1+v(x)2k^2 + o ( k^-4 ) .",
    "singularities in the green s function in the upper half plane correspond to normalizable eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , which represent bound states .",
    "since the hamiltonian is hermitian , the bound states must have real energies , so the singularities must lie on the imaginary axis and have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass . in this example , we have a repulsive potential and a massless particle , each of which is sufficient to ensure that there are no bound states at all .",
