    "due to the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation  @xcite , large scale structure ( lss )  @xcite , and ia supernovae  @xcite we known that the universe is actually in accelerated expansion . a direct way to incorporate this accelerated expansion of universe into einstein",
    "general relativity theory  @xcite is to include the cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "the inclusion of this constant has the same effect of a non - zero vacuum energy density , @xmath7 , in such way that the pressure @xmath8 and the density @xmath9 are related by a state equation with the form @xmath10 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the accelerated expansion of universe can also be described by adding to the universe content a homogeneous fluid with energy density @xmath11 , the so called _ dark energy _",
    "this fluid has positive energy density @xmath12 , and negative pressure @xmath13 , in such way that @xmath14 .",
    "this pressure is then responsible for the accelerated universe expansion .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that @xmath15 of universe content must be in the dark energy form .",
    "also , dark energy would be uniformly distributed in all space , and so , its density is constant in all points and times .",
    "this is in contrast with the time evolution of baryonic matter density @xmath16 , that diminishes due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "it is called _ the cosmic coincidence _ to the fact that today , the baryonic matter density , @xmath16 has approximately the same value of dark energy density @xmath12  @xcite . to compare different cosmological models , it is common to define the density parameter @xmath17 that it is the ratio between the density @xmath18 with the critical density @xmath19 of the friedmann universe , @xmath20 . in this sense",
    "the cosmic coincidence implies in the equality @xmath21 .",
    "this coincidence can be viewed as an indicative of the existence of some dynamical effect that relates both scales of baryonic matter and of the dark energy density .",
    "nevertheless , among all the models in the literature that are devoted to explain the accelerated expansion of universe , there is a class of dynamical models that obtain the desired negative pressure due to the inclusion of a scalar field that is the responsible for the variations in the expected value of vacuum energy . as the neutrino squared mass difference , @xmath22 ev@xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of third and first neutrino mass state , is of same order of dark energy scale , it is straightforward to think a model in which the scalar field couple to neutrinos and hence , the total energy of the fluid can vary slowly as the neutrino density decreases  @xcite . in the _ mass varying neutrino _ models",
    "the inclusion of a scalar field allow the coupling of neutrino and dark energy densities due to the non - standard neutrino - scalar coupling . the main consequence of this coupling to the neutrino physics is the fact that now the neutrino masses depends on the medium density .",
    "this field could couples neutrinos to the baryonic matter and also to the neutrino background  @xcite .",
    "the consequences in cosmology of mavan s had been studied in last years  @xcite and references therein .    for the neutrino phenomenology the consequences of mavan s were studied for the solar and atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we will use the data from super - kamiokande ( sk for now ) experiment  @xcite . in the experiment",
    "sk , down - going neutrinos , the ones that are produce in the atmosphere immediately over super - kamiokande detector , reaches sk with the the cosine of zenith angle @xmath26 and travels approximately 20 km in the atmosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "up - going neutrinos are produced in the opposite side of the planet and crosses all the earth before reaches sk in the the cosine of zenith angle @xmath27 direction .",
    "the so - called _ up - down _ asymmetry of neutrino events in sk is recognized as the first experimental corroboration of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "we explicit here that atmospheric neutrinos that arrives at sk from different directions travels different distances and crosses regions of very distinct densities ( see next section for details ) .",
    "this fact makes the angular distribution of events in sk a good place to looking for dependence of medium density effects in the propagation of neutrinos . in fact , the sk experiment reported no improvement of data fit due to the inclusion of diagonal mavan s mechanism in the propagation of atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite . for our knowledge",
    "there is no analysis made for non - diagonal mavan s mechanism for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we also apply the mavan s model to describe the beam muon neutrinos and anti - neutrinos at minos experiment  @xcite , where a muon neutrino or muon anti - neutrino beam with energy between few hundred of mev and few gev .",
    "the neutrino or anti - neutrino beam travels a few hundred of kilometers inside earth s crust before reach the far detector . by the comparison between the number of neutrino events in near and far detector minos collaboration",
    "has measure precisely the standard neutrino parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in mavan s context , the main difference between minos beam and sk is that in the former neutrinos cross only the upper crust of earth , that can be described by a constant matter density and the latter cross a different non - constant densities . in this way",
    "the mavan s effective oscillation for minos , with a constant density and with sk with a variable density allow us to test the essential characteristic of mavan mechanism , the density dependence of the neutrino mass differences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section  ( [ sec : model ] ) we describe the framework to mavans that we adopt and in sec .",
    "( [ oscilograms ] ) we show the changes in neutrino oscillations due to mavans .",

    "conclusions are in section   ( [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "in the neutrino mass - mixing formalism , the time evolution of neutrino flavor eigenstates is given in terms of neutrino mixing , in which one has to describe the flavor eigenstate and hence , the time evolution of atmospheric neutrinos , in the two neutrino flavor approximation , is given by the evolution equation @xmath31\\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\nu_{\\mu}\\\\ \\nu_{\\tau } \\end{array}\\right)~ , \\label{sch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hamiltonian assumes the form , in the mass basis , @xmath32~ , \\label{mmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the neutrino energy , @xmath34 is the square difference of mass eigenstates , and @xmath35 is the mixing matrix @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "we investigate the consequences of such model in the phenomenology of atmospheric neutrino data from super - kamiokande experiment and for the data from minos experiment using for the first time to test the existence of non - diagonal mavan parameter .    using the fact the mavan for the constant matter density , as it is the case for the minos experiment , have the same functional form of standard oscillation scenario we use the minos analysis for the standard neutrino oscillation and we extend for the mavan scenario . in this analysis larger values of non - diagonal mavan parameter , @xmath241 , are allowed and we have significant changes in the allowed region for oscillation parameters , @xmath214 and @xmath242 .",
    "we compute by ourselves the event rate for super - kamiokande experiment , involves the correct description of the _ sub - gev _ and _ multi - gev _ neutrino energy samples and we also use the analysis of the minos experiment to made a combined fit of these two experiments . in minos experiment the neutrino crosses only a small chord of the earth and then the neutrino feels a constant matter density and for other side the super - kamiokande have neutrinos coming from different directions and therefore feels different medium densities .",

    "the allowed region for the oscillation parameters , @xmath214 and @xmath242 is shown in fig  ( [ fig : deltachi - dmsin-2 ] ) that shows that the allowed region is very stable with the addition of mavan scenario .",
