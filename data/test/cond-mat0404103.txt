    "by now , jump - diffusion processes and more general lvy processes or lvy driven processes are widely used in models of the stock dynamics and term structure models , under both historic and risk neutral measure . however , only discrete time series of empirical data are available , therefore the problem of identification of the jump and diffusion components is a non - trivial task .",
    "the problem of the identification of the diffusion component was considered in detail in ait - sahalia ( 2002 , 2003 ) ; in the present paper , the focus is on the jump component . clearly , the presence of jumps is most prominent in prices of contingent claims near expiry , especially for out - of - the money options , and therefore it is natural to extract information about the jump part of the process by using empirical data for out - of - the - money european options .",
    "carr and wu ( 2003 ) showed that in the presence of jumps , the prices of out - of - the - money european options near expiry are of order @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the time to expiry , and use this observation to test for the presence of jumps .",
    "however , the results in carr and wu ( 2003 ) are qualitative rather than quantitative .",
    "the principal aim of the present paper is to derive simple analytical formulas which can be used for the identification of the jump part of a lvy process ( under a risk - neutral measure chosen by the market ) ; the straightforward generalizations to mean - reverting processes driven by lvy processes ( the ornstein - uhlenbeck type processes ) , stochastic volatility models with jumps and lvy - driven term structure models will be published elsewhere .",
    "the first group of results of the present paper are formulas for @xmath0 , or time decay , of out - of - the money european call and put options on a stock , at expiry .",
    "contrary to the gaussian case , @xmath0 for the former ( resp .",
    ", the latter ) is shown to be negative if there are positive ( resp . , negative ) jumps . in other words , we prove that near expiry , these prices are linear functions of time to expiry ( up to relatively small errors ) , and calculate the coefficients .",
    "the results are explicit analytical expressions in terms of the parameters which characterize the process . by using these formulas and empirical data for options near expiry as in carr and wu ( 2003 )",
    ", it is possible to identify the jump part of a particular lvy model .",
    "after that , by using the data for options far from expiry , one can identify the first instantaneous moment of the process , and calculate the diffusion coefficient by subtracting the second instantaneous moment of the jump part of the process .",
    "this gives a new identification method for the diffusion component . by using the formulas for the @xmath0 s for the european",
    "put and call , we obtain approximations for the american put price and early exercise boundary near expiry .",
    "the pricing of american options in the gaussian case is well understood ",
    "see e.g. musiela and rutkowski ( 1997 ) , karatzas and shreve ( 1998 ) , carr and faguet ( 1994 ) , carr ( 1998 ) , longstaff and schwartz ( 2001 ) , clment et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the bibliography therein . in the infinite horizon case ,",
    "explicit analytical formulas are obtained , and in the finite horizon case , a number of efficient numerical methods are developed .",
    "although explicit formulas are not available in the finite horizon case , several general results are proved for this case as well .",
    "consider the american put with the strike price @xmath4 and maturity @xmath5 , on a non - dividend paying stock ; the riskless rate @xmath6 is constant .",
    "let @xmath7 be the optimal exercise price of the american put .",
    "if the stock log - price @xmath8 follows the brownian motion , then the asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 is known both near expiry : @xmath10 as @xmath11 ( see , e.g. , barles _",
    "( 1995 ) and lamberton ( 1995 ) ; an asymptotic formula for the put price is also available ) , and for small values of @xmath12 : for any @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( see , e.g. musiela and rutkowski ( 1997 ) ; ( [ asymprgauss ] ) is formulated as follows : if the riskless interest rate is zero , then the early exercise of the american put is not optimal ) .",
    "notice that ( [ asbgauss ] ) implies that @xmath15 and that ( [ exlim ] ) and ( [ asymprgauss ] ) do not agree well when both the riskless interest rate and time to expiry vanish .",
    "in levendorski ( 2003 ) , a variant of carr s randomization method was developed for wide families of lvy processes , and as a by - product , it was shown that for many families of non - gaussian processes used in empirical studies of financial markets , the analogs of ( [ exlim ] ) and ( [ asymprgauss ] ) agree much better .",
    "namely , @xmath16 where @xmath17 depends on some of parameters which characterize the price process , and is _ smaller _ than the strike price , @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it was proved that @xmath17 vanishes with @xmath12 , and therefore , @xmath18 notice that ( [ asymprlevy ] ) looks more natural than ( [ asymprgauss ] ) , and may be of some importance in today s almost deflationary world .",
    "further , if the difference @xmath19 is sizable , then any numerical procedure or parameters fitting procedure which does not take this fact into account , may produce significant errors near expiry and strike . hence , the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary has practical implications for the parameters fitting and development of accurate numerical methods .    however , the proof in levendorski ( 2003 ) has three disadvantages , which stem from the use of the wiener - hopf method .",
    "first , the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary results from long calculations without clear intuition .",
    "next , the approximate formulas for the put price are expressed in terms of the factors in the wiener - hopf factorization formula , hence , they are complicated for practical use , and finally , the method in levendorski ( 2003 ) is not directly applicable to a popular class of variance gamma processes , which was used in carr et al ( 2002 ) , madan and hirsa ( 2003 ) , and carr and hirsa ( 2003 ) for pricing of american put .",
    "the generalization of the method for more general classes of processes seems impossible .",
    "here we prove ( [ exlimlevy ] ) and ( [ asymprlevy ] ) by using a much simpler argument .",
    "we obtain an efficient approximation for the put price near expiry , and formulate the result about the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary in a more meaningful form . also , we extend the result in levendorski ( 2003 ) to variance gamma processes , and in addition , we find a condition on a process which ensures that the behavior of the boundary is even more regular than in the gaussian case : there exists a negative constant @xmath20 s.t . @xmath21",
    "we prove that the limit of the boundary at expiry is located where @xmath22 of the european call is equal to the riskless rate .",
    "( if the @xmath22 of the european call at expiry is less than the riskless rate for all spot prices less than the strike , then the limit is the strike . ) when the corresponding equation is solved , one can use the formulas for @xmath0 s of the european call and put and obtain an efficient approximation to the put price near expiry .",
    "the formulas are fairly simple and can be used for parameters fitting purposes near expiry , both for the european options and american put .",
    "they also can be used to improve performance of numerical methods : when using the backward induction , one can start not at expiry , where the value function is most irregular but close to it , and use the analytical approximation as the basis for the backward induction .",
    "we demonstrate how large the deviations from the standard behavior of the early exercise boundary and put price can be by using the empirical data for the american put documented in carr et al .",
    "we found that the non - standard behavior should be observed for reasonable values of the riskless rate : typically , the margin between the strike and boundary is 10% or more , and for the spot price in the 5%interval around the strike , the  jump premium \" in the put price over the pay - off is @xmath23 or more , where @xmath3 is the time to expiry ( with the normalization @xmath24 for a business year ) .",
    "the last aim of the paper is to describe the restrictions on the log - price process under an emm , which should be satisfied if the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary is observed . as ( [ exlim ] ) , ( [ exlimlevy ] ) and ( [ superregular ] ) imply , various types of the behavior of @xmath9 near expiry are possible",
    "however , for many families of processes used in empirical studies of financial markets , namely , hyperbolic processes , normal inverse gaussian processes ( nig ) , and truncated lvy processes of the extended koponen s family ( a.k.a .",
    "kobol processes , a.k.a .",
    "cgmy model ) of order @xmath25 , the behavior of the early exercise boundary is non - standard for all parameters values .",
    "this means that if in the empirical studies , the early exercise boundary for put options on a particular stock exhibits the standard behavior near expiry , then the use of any of the processes above to model the log - price dynamics under a risk - neutral measure chosen by the market is inconsistent with the data .",
    "normal inverse gaussian processes , hyperbolic processes and kobol processes of order greater than 1 are processes with sample paths of infinite variation .",
    "notice that the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary is proved for much wider classes of infinite variation lvy processes as well . for processes with finite variation jump component , the prominent examples being variance gamma processes and kobol processes of order less than 1 , both the non - standard behavior ( [ exlimlevy ] ) and  super - regular \" behavior ( [ superregular ] ) of the early exercise boundary are possible , depending on parameters of the process",
    "; there are also borderline cases , when we are able only to prove that ( [ exlim ] ) holds . according to a recent empirical study in carr et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , finite variation processes fit empirical data better .    even for a finite variation process , if we fix all the parameters of a process except for the drift @xmath26 , let @xmath27 and change @xmath26 accordingly so that the stock remains a martingale , then below a certain critical value of @xmath12 ( depending on the parameters of the process ) ,",
    "the non - standard behavior is observed , and as @xmath12 decreases further , the optimal exercise price goes to zero uniformly over the interval @xmath2 .",
    "it is natural to ask how robust the result about the non - standard behavior of the early exercise boundary is . in levendorski ( 2003 ) and",
    "the present paper , it is assumed that dynamics of log - prices @xmath8 follows a non - gaussian lvy process under a risk - neutral measure chosen by the market .",
    "this simplest choice of a non - gaussian risk - neutral measure for pricing of the american put was employed in carr et al ( 2002 ) , madan and hirsa ( 2003 ) , carr and hirsa ( 2003 ) , where parameters fitting and computational issues where addressed .",
    "better fit can be achieved with stochastic volatility models with jumps but the method in levendorski ( 2003 ) can not be generalized for stochastic volatility models .",
    "the method of the present paper can be applied to stochastic volatility models ( and term structure models ) , and under certain parameter restrictions , the margin between the early exercise boundary and strike can be derived .",
    "further , in levendorski ( 2003 ) and the present paper , the formulas for the margin are derived in two different approximate models , and in cases which were considered in the both papers , the formulas for the margin are the same .",
    "the identical results in two approximations allows one to hope that the margin in the continuous time model is the same . as a proven theorem",
    ", we can only claim that the margin in the approximate model is not less than in the continuous time model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ levy ] , we recall the definition of lvy processes , and give examples of several families of lvy processes used in empirical studies of financial markets . in section",
