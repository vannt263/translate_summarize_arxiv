    "the bcs to bec crossover problem of a fermi gas with an adjustable attractive interaction has been investigated theoretically for quite some time @xcite . for low temperatures",
    "the gas is superfluid and , in the case of s - wave interactions , it exhibits a smooth crossover from the well known bcs regime of weakly bound cooper pairs to the bec regime of tightly bound bosonic dimers with a residual repulsive interaction @xcite . in recent years , this crossover has been realized experimentally using ultracold fermi gases in optical traps , where the interaction can be tuned using feshbach resonances @xcite . in the experimentally relevant case of",
    "so called broad feshbach resonances , which is in principle always realized in the dilute limit , the physical properties of the homogeneous gas at equal densities for both spin components are described by only two dimensionless parameters : the interaction strength @xmath3 and the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "here , @xmath5 is the @xmath6-wave scattering length which fully characterizes interactions in the dilute , ultracold limit , while the scales for length and energy are determined by the fermi wave number @xmath7 and the fermi energy @xmath8 , respectively , where @xmath9 is the particle density .",
    "a particularly interesting regime is located near the feshbach resonance , where the scattering length @xmath5 is infinite . at this point and , more generally , in the so - called _ unitary regime _ where @xmath10 , the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath11 disappears from the problem .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities are therefore universal functions of the dimensionless temperature @xmath4 @xcite . on a microscopic level ,",
    "the unitary gas exhibits a particular kind of scale invariance , similar to a gas with purely inverse square two - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "more generally , as shown by nikolic and sachdev @xcite , universality is not restricted to the unitary regime .",
    "it is tied to the fact that the unitary balanced gas at zero density is an unstable fixpoint with only three relevant perturbations . since there is no small expansion parameter",
    ", the unitary regime is the most challenging one from a theoretical point of view .",

    "we have connected the normal and superfluid branches with a kink at the point , where they are closest , thus providing an optimal approximation to the exact continuous profiles in a theory which properly accounts for the continuous nature of the transition in the infinite system .",

    "consequently , in these cases the entropy density is minimum in the center of the trap but maximum at a nonzero radius .",
    "for very low temperatures ( black dashed line ) , the main contribution of the entropy is located close to the surface of the atom cloud .",
    "the width of this surface layer decreases for decreasing temperature and eventually shrinks to zero in the zero temperature limit ( black solid line ) .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : entropy_profiles ] , is that sufficiently below the onset of superfluidity in a trapped fermi gas , most of the entropy is located in the normal region near the cloud edge .",
    "this observation suggests an efficient way to lower the entropy further by removing atoms in the boundary layer and simultaneously readjusting the trapping potential such that the now smaller system has a radius close to that beyond which atoms have been removed .",
    "this idea is - of course - in the same spirit than the standard evaporation cooling in the normal state @xcite , however it is much more efficient .",

    "slight differences would occur in the high - temperature regime where the energies @xmath1 and the entropies @xmath145 are large .",

    "et al . _",
    "the data are shown as green points with horizontal and vertical error bars .",
    "clearly the data agree with all theories in the high - temperature regime .",
    "the slightly larger entropy values of the experimental data for large energies may be due to the fact that the experiment is performed for a gaussian potential while the theoretical curves are calculated for a harmonic potential .",
    "apparently , for low temperatures and low entropies the experimental data agree better with the theories of bulgac _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and of hu _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite than with our theory .",
    "in particular , an extrapolation to zero entropy gives a ground - state energy @xmath174 , considerably higher than our value @xmath175 .",
    "it is difficult , however , to quantify the error involved in such an extrapolation because the determination of the entropy from a comparison with its ideal fermi gas limit reached after an adiabatic ramp to magnetic fields @xmath176 far on the bcs side of the crossover becomes increasingly difficult as @xmath145 approaches zero .",
    "as pointed out above , a quite sensitive parameter which distinguishes previous theories from our present one is the critical temperature of the superfluid transition and the associated value of the entropy and energy .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to determine the critical temperature and thus also the corresponding value of the entropy from measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "based on the excellent agreement of our value for @xmath159 and the bertsch parameter @xmath54 with the most precise numerical or field - theoretical results and the fact that all thermodynamic relations are obeyed at the few percent level , it is likely that our present theory gives a reliable description of the thermodynamics of the trapped unitary gas , despite the fact that , superficially , the agreement with the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] is not as good as those of previous theories .",
    "the most important parameter for thermodynamic properties is - of course - the temperature , which unfortunately can not be measured directly . in principle , this is possible from the density profile @xmath15 which changes as a function of temperature . for balanced gases , however , this method is not very reliable .",
    "indeed , for low temperatures , the density converges to the simple thomas - fermi profile . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_profiles ] , the deviations from such a profile at finite temperatures are extremely small for the inner part of the atom cloud ( see the red and brown low - temperature curves , which are nearly identical to the black zero - temperature curve ) . only close to the surface @xmath177 , small variations with the temperature are observed .",
    "therefore , the signal to noise ratio will be small in the interesting regime below @xmath178 .    a quantity which is much more sensitive to temperature is the entropy density , shown in fig .",

    "unfortunately , the local entropy density @xmath179 is not accessible experimentally .",

    "the related profiles are similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy_profiles ] . for low temperatures",
    "the excess internal energy density is peaked close to the surface of the atom cloud .",
    "integrating over the space we obtain the excess internal energy @xmath184 which is related to the excess total energy by the virial theorem @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , the total energy @xmath1 is related to the mean square radius of the atom cloud @xmath186 according to @xmath187 . since @xmath186 can be measured in a model - independent way @xcite , the total energy @xmath188 as a function of the temperature @xmath37 provides an alternative method to determine the temperature of the interacting fermi gas .",
    "we obtain a curve which is similar like fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy - temperature ] .",
    "however , the major drawback of this method is that it requires knowledge of the ground state energy @xmath152 , which must be determined with sufficient accuracy . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] , there are significant discrepancies in the ground state energy @xmath152 for different experiments and theories .",
    "in the superfluid regime at very low temperatures the fermionic quasiparticles are frozen out and do not contribute to thermodynamic quantities because they have an energy gap which is related to the binding energy of the cooper pairs",
    ". however , the spontaneous symmetry breaking implies a gapless goldstone mode which is the bogoliubov - anderson mode .",
    "this mode propagates with a constant velocity @xmath189 like phonons . for this reason ,",
    "the low temperature behavior of the entropy density and the internal energy density is ruled by the well known stefan - boltzmann formulas @xmath190 n(\\mathbf{r } ) & = &   2\\ , \\frac{\\sigma(\\mathbf{r})}{c(\\mathbf{r})}\\ , t^4   \\label{eq : stefan_boltzmann_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for phonons with one polarization degree of freedom where @xmath191 ^ 2)$ ] is the stefan - boltzmann factor .",

    "@xcite we have calculated all thermodynamic quantities for the homogeneous system . hence , also the function @xmath198 is available , so that we can check the asymptotic formula for the homogeneous system .",
    "it turns out that the resulting exponent at low energy is indeed equal to @xmath199 .",
    "however the amplitude , which is determined fully by the sound velocity @xmath189 , gives @xmath200 for the unitary fermi gas .",
    "this is about a factor of two larger than the expected value @xmath201 from the bertsch parameter .",
    "this discrepancy indicates , that the accuracy of our theory at very low temperatures is not sufficient to extract a reliable value of the sound velocity from the entropy .    in the trapped case ,",
    "unfortunately , asymptotic formulas like - do not hold for the total entropy @xmath145 and the total energy @xmath1 . to see this , we integrate eqs .   and over the whole space .",
    "using eqs .",
    "and we obtain well defined results @xmath145 and @xmath202 for the left hand sides , respectively .",
    "however , while the temperature @xmath37 is constant , the space dependence on the right - hand sides arise from the factor @xmath203^{-3 }   \\sim [ v_f(\\mathbf{r})]^{-3 } \\sim [ n(\\mathbf{r})]^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this factor is minimum at the center of the trap but maximum at the surface of the atom cloud .",
    "thus , the main contribution of the integral arises from the surface of the atom cloud ( see also fig .  [ fig : entropy_profiles ] ) . here",
    "the fermi gas is a normal fluid , and the dimensionless temperature @xmath204 is large , so that the stefan - boltzmann formulas are not applicable .",

    "whether such a behavior is consistent with a microscopic theory , we determine the exponent @xmath208 by logarithmic differentiation of the blue - green - red solid curve @xmath147 in fig .  [ fig : entropy ] . the result is shown as blue solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents ] and confirms that @xmath0 in a trap indeed exhibits a power law behavior in the regime near the ground state .",
    "we have adjusted the ground - state energy @xmath152 by fine tuning in order to obtain a well defined exponent in the limit @xmath209 .",
    "the resulting exponent @xmath210 is surprisingly close to the value @xmath211 of the local asymptotic formula but differs from the value @xmath212 inferred from the experimental fit .    in fig .",

    "the left part of the blue solid curve corresponds to the superfluid region . here",

    "the right part of the blue solid curve corresponds to the normal fluid region . here",
    "the logarithmic derivative of the entropy with respect to energy decreases monotonically with increasing energy @xmath1 and thus no well defined exponent can be attributed to the high energy part of the curve .",
    "the virial theorem implies the energy relations @xmath214 . in order to check the validity of the virial theorem we consider the entropy functions @xmath215 and @xmath216 and calculate the related exponents @xmath217 and @xmath218 , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents ] as green dashed line and as red dot - dashed line , respectively .",
    "these lines should be compared with the blue solid line , which represents the exponent @xmath219 . in the normal - fluid region",

    "very good agreement is obtained .",
    "however , the value of the critical temperature and the behavior at very low temperatures differ appreciably from the experimental estimates and their theoretical analysis in earlier work .    first of all , our value for the bertsch parameter @xmath54 and thus the ground - state energy @xmath152 is about @xmath223 smaller than the results obtained from variational monte carlo calculations or from gaussian fluctuation theories around the bcs ansatz for the ground state .",
    "while our value @xmath224 agrees well with the most precise results so far obtained from an @xmath225 expansion @xcite , it differs from those obtained from variational monte carlo calculations @xcite , or from those including gaussian fluctuations around the bcs mean field @xcite , where @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "given the uncertainty in determining @xmath54 experimentally ( which requires an extrapolation to zero temperature ) it is clearly important for theory to make precise predictions for @xmath54 which do not rely on approximations that are apparently limiting all present results .",
    "in view of the fundamental importance of this parameter in the context of strongly interacting fermi gases , progress here would be highly desirable .    as a second point ,",
