    "in recent years , there have been much interest in dirac materials such as graphene@xcite , topological insulators@xcite , high - temperature @xmath3-wave superconductors@xcite , which are described by the dirac - like equation at low energies .",
    "dirac materials show novel physical features because of the chiral band dispersion with spin - momentum locking and the existence of the weyl points at which conduction and valence bands touch , distinguishing themselves from other conventional materials with parabolic energy dispersion at low energies .",
    "recently three dimensional ( 3d ) weyl semimetals , which are 3d analogs of graphene , have attracted considerable attention because they are expected to give a broad spectrum of unusual physical properties as two dimensional graphene . in recent experiments of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy ,",
    "several materials such as cd@xmath4as@xmath5@xcite , na@xmath4bi@xcite , nbas@xcite , tap@xcite , zrte@xmath6@xcite and taas@xcite have been identified as weyl semimetals .",
    "in addition , several efforts have been made on the realization of weyl semimetals in artificial systems such as photonic crystals@xcite .",
    "recently , a new type of weyl semimetals referred to as multi - weyl semimetals has been proposed@xcite .",
    "these materials are characterized by double ( triple ) weyl - nodes in which the band dispersion is linear along one direction and quadratic ( cubic ) along the remaining two directions . because of the change in topological nature and the enhancement of the density of states , the anisotropic non - linear energy dispersion and a modified spin - momentum locking structure have important consequences in topological , transport and interaction - induced properties@xcite . despite their broad interest , however ,",
    "there have been lack of studies on the collective modes of charge oscillations in chiral gapless systems including multi - weyl systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate electronic collective modes of chiral gapless electron - hole systems in 3d and to find wave - vector - dependent plasmon dispersions , considering interband transitions along with chirality of the systems . given the great current interest in gapless linearly dispersing dirac systems and the emergence of multi - weyl semimetals , it is necessary to obtain results for linear and higher - order dispersions in 3d in order to develop intuition about the dispersion and chirality dependence of electronic properties .",
    "we consider both gapless semimetals with an isotropic band dispersion and multi - weyl semimetals with an anisotropic band dispersion .",
    "we calculate the plasmon modes and the energy loss functions ( spectral strength ) in gapless semimetals , and present analytical and numerical results for long - wavelength plasma frequencies focusing on the effect of chirality . throughout the paper",
    "we consider the systems with the finite carrier density , i.e. , either electron or hole doped ( or gated ) systems at zero temperatures .",
    "we find many intriguing and unexpected features of the plasmon modes and their landau damping in gapless semimetals . for chiral systems with the isotropic linear and quadratic band dispersion ( @xmath7 in @xmath8 )",
    "the long - wavelength plasmons lie outside the landau damping regions due to the depolarization effects arising from the interband transition and therefore they do not decay by producing electron - hole pairs . for the systems with higher - order dispersions ( @xmath9 ) , the long - wavelength plasma frequencies divided by fermi energy ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) increase as the density decreases and enter the interband single particle excitation ( spe ) region at the critical carrier density , where the dispersion shows a discrete energy jump . for the multi - weyl systems with an anisotropic dispersion ( i.e. , with a linear band dispersion along @xmath11 direction and non - linear in @xmath12-@xmath13 directions ) , one interesting salient feature in the calculated plasma frequency is the density dependence of the plasmon .",
    "we find that the density dependence of the long - wavelength plasma frequency along the direction of non - linear dispersion behaves like that of the isotropic linear band model ( @xmath14 ) , while along the direction of linear dispersion it behaves like that of the isotropic non - linear model ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we find that both the plasmons remain undamped over a broad range of density and interaction strength due to the chirality induced red - shift of plasmon modes .",
    "we believe that our predictions may be easily observable via inelastic light - scattering spectroscopy@xcite or inelastic electron - scattering spectroscopy @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider semimetals with arbitrary isotropic band dispersion and present analytical and numerical results for long - wavelength plasma frequencies at zero temperature . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider multi - weyl semimetals with an anisotropic dispersion and present results for zero - temperature plasma frequencies . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize and conclude our results .",
    "before we calculate the collective modes in gapless multi - weyl semimetals with anisotropic energy band dispersions , we first consider the gapless semimetals with the isotropic band dispersions .",
    "for the isotropic model we consider the following hamiltonian that describes a chiral gapless system with the symmetric energy dispersion , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wave vector , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are pauli matrices acting in the space of two bands involved at the weyl point , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are material dependent parameters , which have units of energy and momentum , respectively .",
    "the corresponding energy dispersions are given by @xmath22 and the eigenfunctions corresponding to the @xmath23 energies are @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the @xmath27 state with positive energy represents the conduction band , and the @xmath28 state with negative energy represents the valence band .",
    "note that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ isotropic_model ] ) with @xmath14 corresponds to the hamiltonian of weyl semimetals . to understand the effects of chirality on the plasmon properties beyond the energy dispersion of the system",
    ", we also consider the following form of a non - chiral gapless hamiltonian : @xmath29 the non - chiral hamiltonian we introduce in eq .",
    "( [ non_chiral_isotropic_model ] ) has exactly the same energy dispersion as the chiral system in eq .",
    "( [ isotropic_model ] ) . unlike the chiral model , however , its eigenstates are completely independent of each other so that the chiral nature of wave functions is absent .",
    "it will be shown later that the interband transitions associated with chirality are largely responsible for differences between plasmons in the presence and absence of chirality .",
    "plasmons are defined as longitudinal in - phase oscillation of all the carriers driven by the self - consistent electric field generated by the local variation in charge density . to find the full plasmon dispersion at finite wave vectors",
    "we need the quantum mechanical many - body theory for the collective motion of all carriers@xcite . within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ,",
    "the plasmon dispersion is obtained by finding zeros of the dynamical dielectric function , which is expressed as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath32 is a background dielectric constant .",

    "since we focus on the long - wavelength plasmons in this work , we neglect transitions between different nodes located at different momenta . within this assumption ,",
    "contributions from other weyl nodes can be taken into account by multiplying the degeneracy factor @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to notice that in the non - chiral model described by eq .",
    "( [ non_chiral_isotropic_model ] ) and later by eq .",
    "( [ non_chiral_anisotropic_model ] ) , the overlap factor becomes the kronecker @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 , which excludes the possibility of any interband transitions between the conduction and valence bands . in this sense ,",

    "the dashed lines represent the boundaries of the intraband and interband electron - hole continua .",
    "note that in the presence of chirality , the plasmon energies are shifted downward for all wave vectors compared with those in the absence of chirality .",
    "here we use the coupling constant @xmath50 , and the fermi energy @xmath51 for @xmath48 and @xmath52 for @xmath49 , respectively . ]",
    "we first consider the loss function of 3d gapless semimetals , which is calculated from the dielectric function ( i.e. , @xmath53 $ ] ) and can be directly measured in experiments such as inelastic electron spectroscopy .",
    "the loss function is related to the dynamical structure factor @xmath54 by @xmath55 $ ] , which gives a direct measure of the spectral strength of the various elementary excitations .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the density plots of calculated energy - loss functions in ( @xmath56 ) space for @xmath48 ( parabolic dispersion ) and @xmath49 ( cubic dispersion ) in the absence ( top panels ) and presence ( bottom panels ) of chirality .",
    "plasmon dispersions are given by sharp peaks of the energy - loss function , which correspond to the poles of the dielectric function . when both re[@xmath57 and im[@xmath57 become zero ( i.e. , @xmath58 , which defines the plasmon mode ) , the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function becomes the dirac @xmath44-function , i.e. , @xmath53=w(q ) \\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{\\rm p}(q))$ ] with the strength @xmath59/\\partial",

    "the electron - hole spe continua show up as weak broad incoherent structure and carries small spectral weight . when the plasmon mode enters the spe continuum at the critical wave vector @xmath61 , the dielectric function @xmath62 has a finite imaginary part and the plasmon mode becomes damped via landau damping .",
    "the plasmon mode inside the landau damping region decays by emitting intraband or interband electron - hole pairs , which is now allowed by energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the broadened peaks inside the spe regions in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] indicate the damped plasmons .",
    "the plasmon energy scaled by the fermi energy ( @xmath10 ) is strongly dependent on the band structure .",
    "one interesting result is the chirality dependence of the plasmon energy , and it is important to note that in the presence of chirality , plasma frequencies are red - shifted .",
    "this is due to the depolarization effect on the plasmon modes , arising from interband transitions .     and ( b ) @xmath49 .",
    "red ( blue ) lines correspond to the results in the presence ( absence ) of chirality .",
    "note that for @xmath48 , @xmath63 diverges in the @xmath64 limit in the absence of chirality , whereas it converges to a finite value in the presence of chirality . for @xmath49 , the chiral plasmon dispersion shows a discrete jump at @xmath65 , where plasmons start decaying into electron - hole pair excitations .",
    "here we use the coupling constant @xmath50 . ]",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the long - wavelength plasma frequencies for @xmath48 and @xmath49 as a function of fermi energy in the presence ( red ) and absence ( blue ) of chirality . in this figure",
    "the boundary of interband spe at @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "if the plasma frequency is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath67 , the plasmon decays ( does not decay ) by landau damping . for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath10 in the absence of chirality increases monotonically with decreasing density and diverges in the low density limit ( @xmath64 ) . in the presence of chirality ,",
    "the plasma frequencies are always smaller than those without chirality , and the energy difference between the two plasmons grows as the carrier density decreases . for @xmath48 ,",
    "as the density goes to zero , the plasma frequency approaches a finite value less than @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 , indicating that the long - wavelength plasmon does not enter the interband electron - hole continuum for the whole range of densities and thus the plasmon is not damped through the landau damping . for @xmath49 , the plasma frequency as a function of",
    "fermi energy exhibits a discrete jump at a critical value of @xmath69 , and below the critical value the plasmon energy becomes bigger than @xmath67 and enters into the interband electron - hole continuum decaying via landau damping .",
    "note that interband transitions are more suppressed at high densities due to pauli - blocking , which narrows the energy range over which interband transitions can occur .",
    "thus , the effect of interband transition on plasmons becomes weaker at high densities , resulting in small depolarization shift in plasmon energy .",
    "for this reason , the signature of chirality in the plasmon dispersions is significant at low densities .    to get further insight into the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , here we present the calculated analytic expressions for the leading - order long - wavelength plasma frequencies ( for details , see appendix a ) , @xmath70 in the absence of chirality and @xmath71^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] in the presence of chirality , where @xmath72 is the coupling constant characterizing the interaction strength .",
    "the above results are calculated in @xmath73 limit for @xmath74 .",
    "note that for @xmath14 weyl semimetals a linear band dispersion leads to cut - off dependent long - wavelength plasma frequencies@xcite .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ chiral plasma frequency ] ) that the plasma frequency with chirality is red - shifted with respect to that without chirality , showing different density dependence at low densities .",
    "this difference originates from the interband transition contribution , which appears in the additional term of the polarizability with the opposite sign of the intraband contribution ( see eq .",
    "( a8 ) in appendix a ) .",
    "this indicates that interband transitions and associated chiral nature of wavefunctions contribute to the depolarization of the screening and are responsible for the red - shift of the plasma frequencies .",
    "it is interesting that the density dependence of the long wavelength plasma frequencies shown in eq .",
    "( [ nonchiral plasma frequency ] ) can be obtained from the classical plasma frequency @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the charge carrier density and @xmath77 is the effective mass of the charge carrier . by using the momentum relation @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the fermi velocity and the fermi wave - vector , respectively ) and the energy dispersion relation @xmath22 for arbitrary band dispersion , the density dependence of the classical plasma frequency can be calculated as @xmath81 which agrees with the full rpa result in eq .",
    "( [ nonchiral plasma frequency ] ) for the non - chiral case .",
    "thus , for @xmath14 we have @xmath82 , i.e. , the plasma frequency scaled by the fermi energy is independent of @xmath83@xcite . for @xmath84 , @xmath85 with @xmath86 ,",
    "i.e. , the scaled plasma frequency increases as the density ( or fermi energy ) decreases and diverge as @xmath87 . note that the interband transition red - shifts the classical plasma frequencies in the presence of chirality .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the plasmon properties of isotropic gapless semimetals . in this section",

    "second , the plasmon dispersion along the out - of - plane direction ( where the band dispersion is linear ) shows a similar behavior as that in the @xmath14 isotropic system .",
