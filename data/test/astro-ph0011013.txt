    "high - energy gamma - rays originating from sources at cosmological distances can be absorbed by pair production in collisions with low - energy photons .",
    "most of the low - energy photons are produced by stars in ordinary galaxies and contribute to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "the role of other contributers , such as active galactic nuclei , is under dispute , and can safely be assumed to be unimportant in terms of the global energy budget . to model the stellar component of the ebl",
    ", we use an approach similar to that used in refs .",
    "@xcite , however with the star formation rate ( sfr ) inferred from deep multi - color galaxy surveys .",
    "other approaches aim at finding an _ ab initio _ description of the sfr from the theory of structure formation @xcite . knowing the ebl as a function of redshift",
    ", one can calculate the optical depth with respect to pair creation and determine the propagation length of gamma - rays from cosmologically distributed sources such as blazars or gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "we start with the spectrum of an evolving simple stellar population ( ssp ) @xcite ( solar metalicity , salpeter imf 0.1 - 100 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "next , we include absorption and re - emission effects ( dust and gas of ism ) using a smc - like extinction law ( @xmath2 ) and two modified blackbody spectra for the re - emission from dust ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is @xmath4 with slopes @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and a peak value @xmath9 ) . by choosing proper parameters , the emissivities @xmath10 obtained from integrating the sfr - weighted ssps",
    "are brought to agreement with the data .",
    "a second integration from @xmath11 to @xmath12 yields the ebl comoving power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which is independent of cosmology due to a cancellation of the cosmology - dependent terms .",
    "the ebl increases from high redshifts towards the present , but saturates at a roughly constant level beyond the peak in the sfr .",
    "the ebl spectrum at high @xmath11 is dominated by young , uv - emitting massive stars .",
    "70% of the energy released by stars is re - emitted by dust in the infrared and far - infrared bands .",
    "the spectrum changes towards its present shape as a result of a growing admixture of aged stars . about 40@xmath13 of the integrated present - day ebl",
    "is contained in the ir ( between @xmath14 and @xmath15)(see fig.[fig2 ] and for details ref .",
    "the pair creation optical depth @xmath16 for gamma - rays at cosmological redshift @xmath11 and observed energy @xmath17 is defined as the ratio of coordinate distance and mean free path @xcite .",
    "the optical depth evaluated for our ebl and a range of redshifts ( @xmath18 ) is shown in fig.[fig3 ] ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath20  mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) .",
    "we can use the optical depth of gamma - rays to infer the intrinsic spectrum of mkn501 from recent data .",
    "this is achieved by simply multiplying the data with the factor @xmath23 $ ] , and the result is shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the gamma - ray horizon @xmath24 defines an interesting relation between distance and cut - off energy .",
    "in contrast to the ebl , the gamma - ray horizon depends on cosmology through the integration over a cosmic line element @xmath25 .",
    "if we switch from a standard cold dark matter model ( fig.[fig3 ] , _ right panel _ , solid line ) to one with a lower matter density ( dashed line , @xmath26 ) , the horizon moves closer and the number of sources which can be detected above a given gamma - ray threshold energy decreases .",
    "the effect could also be mimicked by a flatter sfr @xcite .",
    "we have developed a simple model for the evolution of the extragalactic background radiation field using a minimum number of parameters by fitting the emissivity predicted by the model to recent results of high - redshift galaxy surveys .",
    "future improvements will include metalicity effects and a pah feature around 10@xmath27 m .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of mkn501 inferred from our model is in good agreement with theoretical predictions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) rendering claims for an extremely high level of the infrared background light intensity implausible .",
    "the ebl model is a powerful tool to analyze gamma - ray spectra from high - redshift sources in the 10  gev to tev regime for which the pair attenuation occurs in interactions with ultraviolet - to - infrared photons allowing to probe the era of maximum star formation or cosmology .",
