    "a topological insulating ( ti ) phase is a new state of quantum matter featuring massless dirac - like boundary states whose robustness is guaranteed by the time - reversal symmetry ( trs)@xcite . in this rapidly growing field ,",
    "search for new topological phases has recently turned to extending the consideration of symmetry - protected states to include non - spatial symmetries@xcite such as , the particle - hole and chiral symmetries as well as the spatial symmetries@xcite . in particular , the nontrivial band topology can be shown to be protected by certain crystal symmetries , leading to the new class of tis called topological crystalline insulators ( tcis)@xcite . like the tis , a three dimensional ( 3d ) tci is also predicted to host metallic surface states on surfaces which preserve appropriate crystal symmetries@xcite .    to date , the semiconducting pb@xmath0sn@xmath1(te , se ) alloys are the only experimentally realized tci materials , whose topological nature has been verified through direct observation of dirac - like surface states via angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite .",
    "these gapless surface states are protected by the mirror symmetry with respect to the ( 110 ) or ( @xmath510 ) lattice plane .",
    "the characteristic features of the associated dirac states such as linear dispersion , lifshitz transition , spin / orbital texture , among others , have been examined via scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) and transport measurements@xcite . moreover , it has been found that , below a critical temperature , which depends on chemical composition , the cubic lattice structure can be distorted by strains , resulting in an orthorhombic or a rhombohedral structure@xcite .",
    "remarkably , in a recent stm experiment by okada _",
    "et al._@xcite , two unexpected landau levels have been observed for the ( 001 ) surface of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se under a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the presence of these two extra levels is believed to be associated with the gap opening of the two surface dirac cones induced by a ferroelectric - like lattice distortion , which breaks the corresponding mirror symmetry .",
    "it is clear that it is important to understand effects of strains on the electronic structure of tcis in order to gain a deeper handle on the nature and origin of their topological states , and how these states could be manipulated for practical applications of the tcis .    despite some strain - related studies in the literature@xcite , we are not aware of a systematic investigation of how spin - textures and other properties of dirac states in the tcis evolve under various symmetry breaking strains .",
    "so motivated , here we examine strain effects on the ( 001 ) surface of the pb@xmath0sn@xmath1(te , se ) tcis .",
    "our analysis is based on an effective four - band model , which is shown to capture all essential features of the topological surface states .",
    "the form of strain related perturbations on the hamiltonian is clarified through general symmetry considerations , allowing us to delineate how characteristic features of the topological states in tcis evolve under strains .",
    "significantly , our analysis shows that certain mirror - symmetry - breaking strains induce hedgehog spin texture with out - of - the - plane spin - polarization at the dirac point .",
    "such a spin texture of dirac states has been reported previously in a 3d ti , but only in the presence of an exchange field@xcite .",
    "our findings thus identify a possible new pathway for realizing tci - based spintronics devices without requiring a trs breaking field@xcite .",
    "moreover , we show that the interplay of strains and applied zeeman field can be used to tune the chern number of the surface ground state , which is a topological invariant characterizing a quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) or a quantum hall insulator .",
    "electron - electron interactions effects are ubiquitous in condensed matter systems , especially when charge screening is relatively poor as is the case generally for dirac - like states in graphene@xcite or tis and tcis.@xcite in this connection , we discuss possible symmetry breaking orders generated under short - range repulsion @xmath6 as a first step toward understanding correlation driven effects on dirac states in the presence of applied strains .",
    "we numerically obtain the zero - temperature phase diagram as a function of @xmath6 and the particle density @xmath7 and delineate its evolution with increasing strength of strain .",
    "our results not only give insight into the nature of competing orders , but also build the foundation for what may be called `` straintronics '' applications driven by electron correlations .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the effective four - band model for the ( 001 ) surface states in the low - energy regime , and its extensions for addressing strain effects in tcis .",
    "iii turns to consider strain effects on properties of the dirac states , including the interplay between applied strains and perpendicular zeeman fields .",
    "these results then allow us to investigate in section iv the possible interaction - driven competing orders in dirac states in the absence as well as presence of strains .",
    "finally , section v comments on potential applications and implications of our study , and concludes with a summary of our results .",
    "we start by reviewing the four - band @xmath2 model for the ( 001 ) surface states in a tci developed previously in ref . , and discuss its generalization to account for effects of strains . on the ( 001 ) surface",

    "this can be done by noticing that the surface states in the vicinity of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related by @xmath49 symmetry , so that the effective model around @xmath4 can be obtained explicitly by a @xmath49 rotation , h_|y(k_x , k_y)=_4 h_|x(k_y ,-",

    "since the gapless surface states in the pb@xmath0sn@xmath1(te , se ) tcis are mainly protected by mirror symmetries , a perturbation , which breaks one of these symmetries can be expected to at least partly gap the surface spectrum , and modify the spin textures around the associated ( massive ) dirac points .",

    "several points should be noted here as follows .",
    "firstly , since the strain perturbation does not break trs , the spin texture for the two massive cones around @xmath3 must form time - reversed partners .",
    "this can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sz ] ) by changing the sign of @xmath67 .",
    "secondly , the out - of - the - plane spin component of the lower cone is basically opposite to that of the upper cone at the same @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the whole spin texture resulting from the strain differs from the case where the hedgehog - like texture is induced by the perpendicular zeeman field when both massive dirac cones around @xmath3 are considered , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1](c ) .    other strain perturbations in table [ t1 ] , which break either the @xmath13-mirror symmetry or both the mirror symmetries , neither open a gap at the dirac point nor induce an out - of - the - plane spin component .",
    "the robustness of this gapless dirac point originates from an underlying symmetry : the former type of perturbation is due to the presence of @xmath59 symmetry , while the latter type ( shear deformation ) is protected by a `` space - time '' symmetry , @xmath68 , with a rotation @xmath69 followed by a time - reversal operation .",
    "the space - time protection now allows persistence of gapless dirac points sitting at generic @xmath70 points away from the mirror line @xmath28 .",
    "this special feature has been noted previously in refs . , and it leads to a new type of tci@xcite .",
    "vanishing out - of - the - plane spin polarization can be proven via symmetry arguments .",
    "for instance , consider the surface states around @xmath3 under the strain perturbation @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian now reads : @xmath72 . assuming @xmath73 is an eigenstate of @xmath74 , the @xmath12-mirror symmetry guarantees that 0=|[_02,_|x]|=2iv_1yk_y |_03| .",
    "thus , the out - of - the - plane spin component @xmath75 vanishes everywhere around @xmath3 .",
    "other perturbations can be analyzed in a similar manner .",
    "there other cases deserve some comment .",
    "the first two cases involve a uniform expansion and a uniaxial stretch ( @xmath49 breaking ) , which correspond to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively@xcite . because both these cases respect trs as well as the mirror symmetries ,",
    "their net effect is only to renormalize the parameters in the original @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , these perturbations do not open a gap at dirac points , although positions of the dirac points could shift in opposite directions along the @xmath28 line .",
    "the third case is an experimentally observed ferroelectric - like distortion@xcite , in which two kinds of atoms are displaced along a certain direction in an opposite manner . denoting the displacement vector @xmath78 , the non - vanishing component of this distortion",
    ", @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , preserves the mirror symmetry with respect to the principal axis @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , but breaks the rotation and the mirror symmetries along a perpendicular direction . to the zeroth order in @xmath70 around @xmath3 , the perturbation due to such distortion",
    "can be straightforwardly shown to have the form : h_f^= _ fxd_x_10+_fyd_y_23 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the coupling strengths .",
    "in fact , the former term is similar to the effect of strain @xmath83 , preserving the gapless dirac points , while the latter term is similar to the effect of strain @xmath84 , resulting in opening a gap instead .     with a fixed zeeman field , where @xmath85 .",
    "the strength of the strain perturbation is given by @xmath86 ( a ) 0 , ( b ) 0.03 , ( c ) 0.05 , and ( d ) 0.08 . from ( b ) to ( d ) , one of the dirac cones around @xmath4 closes and reopens again due to a band inversion .",
    "the model parameters are the same as those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : b1].,width=264 ]      like a perpendicular zeeman field , the strain field on the surface of a tci may not only give rise to spin reorientation , but it may also induce a charge gap in the dirac cones . however , there are key differences in the effects of strain and zeeman fields . an applied zeeman field , which respects @xmath69 rotational symmetry around the @xmath10-axis , opens gaps with the _ same _ sign in the pair of dirac cones around @xmath3 , while an applied strain field , which breaks @xmath69 rotational symmetry , would induce gaps with _ opposite _ sign .",
    "this observation provides the foundation for tenability of the chern number via the interplay of applied strain and zeeman fields , suggested in ref . using a simplified two - band model for each dirac point .    as a concrete example based on our four - band model , consider an applied zeeman field along the @xmath10 direction along with a strain field which breaks @xmath87 but preserves @xmath59 around @xmath4 on the ( 001 ) surface . from symmetry considerations ,",

    "note that for a given @xmath88 , all four low - energy dirac points open gaps in the absence of an applied strain [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : biv](a ) ] .",
    "when a non - vanishing @xmath90 is introduced , the gaps of the two massive dirac cones around @xmath4 evolve in an opposite manner in the sense that one cone increases while the other decreases .",

    "in contrast to the case without strain , a coexisting phase lying between the @xmath18-cdw and fm phases is now seen to emerge .",
    "suppression of the @xmath18-cdw phase with strain can be anticipated on physical grounds .",
    "the reason is that any @xmath140 order requires good nesting between the valleys , but the strain weakens the nesting tendency by opening gaps at dirac points along the @xmath13-mirror line .",
    "notably , in the strained system , spin polarization in the fm phase is mainly contributed by the @xmath19 orbital due to the broken mirror symmetry , which lifts the @xmath51 orbital to higher energies .     versus @xmath7 phase diagram in the presence of a moderate strain .",
    "lines mark boundaries between various continuous phases . ]",
    "when the coupling strength of the applied strain @xmath89 becomes the largest energy scale in the system , all other degrees of freedom can be ignored at the @xmath104 valley as states around @xmath104 are all gapped out , leading to the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3 ] .",
    "all @xmath140 orders are seen to disappear , and only the fm phase survives for @xmath148 at a given density @xmath7 .",
    "the presence of the concave boundary region separating the metallic and fm phases in fig .",
    "8 can be understood from energetics : at any given density in this region , the chemical potential lies within the gap induced by the fm order at @xmath149 , yielding a gain in free energy and thus lowers @xmath150 .",
    "as the particle density increases , the chemical potential is eventually unable to locate within the gap and this argument fails .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath142 , although the ground state is insulating with a small gap due to trs breaking , the system does not exhibit quantum anomalous hall effect .",
    "this should be contrasted sharply with the case of a zeeman field applied perpendicular to the ( 001 ) surface of a tci in the non - interacting limit , where such a broken trs leads to non - vanishing chern number as shown in sec .",
    "iiib above .     versus @xmath7 phase diagram in the case of large strain .",
    "solid line marks the boundary between the two continuous phases . ]",
    "some of the strains discussed in this study could be realized experimentally through chemical doping .",
    "since pbse and snse assume cubic and orthorhombic structures@xcite , respectively , strains or lattice distortions could likely be manipulated by adjusting chemical compositions .",
    "in fact , a ferroelectric - like lattice distortion has been observed in the tcis via stm / sts spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "mechanical tuning could provide another approach .",
    "for example , a piezoelectric layer could be grown on the surface of a tci to allow manipulation of strains via electric field as proposed in ref ..    as to practical applications , we have shown clearly that the chern number of the surface states can be tuned through the interplay of applied strain and zeeman fields .",
    "this provides a potential new handle for controlling the topological conducting edge channels for low power - consuming , next generation electronic technologies .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows that in the presence of electron - electron interactions , ferromagnetism could be turned on / off via strain fields , which , offering a novel pathway toward spintronics applications .    in summary",
    ", we have systematically investigated the effects of strains , which break either one or both mirror symmetries without breaking time - reversal symmetry , on the ( 001 ) surface of the tcis . under mirror - symmetry breaking strains , the low energy dirac cones not only become massive , but also develop hedgehog - like spin textures .",
    "we show that the chern number of the surface states can be tuned via applied strain fields in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "finally , we delineate the competing orders that can result from varying strengths of short - range ( repulsive ) electron - electron interactions at the mean - field level , and show that the resulting correlated phases are amenable to control through strain fields .",
    "the tunability of the interacting as well as the non - interacting electronic structures and topological states of the tcis via strain fields and their interplay with zeeman fields as revealed by our study suggests new pathways for developing spintronics and other applications platforms based on the tcis .",
