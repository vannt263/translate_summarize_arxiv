    "the quantumness of correlations in composed quantum systems is believed to be the resource behind the advantage of protocols developed ( to process and transmit information ) in quantum information theory ( qit ) over its classical counterparts .",
    "therefore one of the main problems in qit is the characterization and quantification of such a resource .",
    "the total correlation in a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 is measured by the quantum mutual information ( qmi ) @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "thus , an important related problem is how to separate the total correlation in its classical and quantum contributions @xcite .",
    "until some time ago , entanglement ( a correlation associated with the separability problem @xcite ) was usually regarded as the only kind of nonclassical correlation in a composed state . however , while this idea is valid for bipartite pure states it is not necessarily true for mixed ones @xcite .",
    "this last class of states can support quantum correlation other than entanglement , e.g. , the correlation revealed by the so - called quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , this general nonclassical correlation can be present even in separable states @xcite and may , in principle , be useful for applications in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamic behavior of classical and nonclassical correlations under decoherence have shown to be very peculiar @xcite .",
    "the decay rates of such correlations may exhibit a sudden change in behavior @xcite , which was experimentally observed in an optical setup in ref .",
    "@xcite . in some situations ,",
    "in which a system immersed in an environment that does not exchange energy with the former , the decoherence phenomenon may occur without entanglement between the system and reservoir @xcite .",
    "this result contradicts our intuition about the cause of the relaxation process .",
    "in such a case the mechanism for the unavoidable information transfer from the system to the environment , and therefore for the coherence loss , is provided by separable - state quantum correlation and its classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "it suggests that besides technological applications , quantifying the quantumness of correlations in separable states is also important from a fundamental point of view .",
    "our intention in this article is to study the symmetry aspects of some quantum correlation quantifiers .",
    "it is well known that the value of qd can be different depending on the bipartition we choose to compute it .",
    "we should mention that in recent years the possible asymmetric quantifier qd have been employed in several scenarios , e.g. , quantum phase transitions @xcite , open quantum systems @xcite , biological systems @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , relativistic effects in qit @xcite , and so on .",
    "thus , it is important to determine in what situations the qd can be used as an adequate quantifier , and when more suitable measures of correlations should be adopted . as already expected , when symmetric definitions for correlations are used",
    ", we have a price to pay regarding its computability through an optimization process which involves more degrees of freedom . in this connection",
    "we obtain , in section 3 , an analytical expression for a symmetric definition of classical correlation and its quantum counterpart [ a symmetric quantum discord ( sqd ) ] for the so - called two - qubit bell - diagonal states .",
    "we also present , in section 4 , explicit examples of classes of states where the asymmetrical quantifiers may be not convenient since different values for the correlations are obtained depending on the measurement process adopted .",
    "in ref . @xcite the authors proposed a quantifier for classical correlation based on the reduction of uncertainty in the state of one partition of a bipartite system , due to measurements performed on the other partition , possibly correlated with the former .",
    "this quantifier can be written as @xmath3 where the quantum conditional entropy of @xmath4 when the partition @xmath5 is measured is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the state @xmath7 is the post measurement reduced density operator of partition @xmath4 which is obtained with probability @xmath8 .",
    "the measurement on partition @xmath5 that reaches the minimum in eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) is that yielding the maximum information about the state of the partition @xmath4 .",
    "the pair @xmath9 can be chosen to be @xmath10 or @xmath11 . here",
    ", the minimum is taken over a complete set of orthogonal projective measurements @xmath12 on the partition @xmath5 instead of the more general positive operator - valued measurements ( povm ) used in the original definition @xcite .",
    "it was shown , in ref .",
    "@xcite , that for two - qubit states eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) is optimized through rank-1 povms . in several practical applications ,",
    "the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) is often computed ( in a simplified way ) considering orthogonal projective measurements .",
    "such a procedure is largely adopted since it gives , at least , a lower bound for the classical content of correlation .",
    "so , we can think of ( [ cc ] ) as quantity related to the classical nature of correlations ( depending on the state considered it could be the classical correlation itself or just a bound ) . here",
    "we will adopt quantities optimized using orthogonal projective measurements for the sake of addressing the issue of symmetry and asymmetry of correlations .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of such issues using general povms is an interesting problem for future investigations .",
    "the quantum correlation may be defined as @xmath13 which , under the conditions regarded here , is identical to the definition of quantum discord introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "so , eq . ( [ cc ] ) is the classical counterpart of the quantum discord and _ vice versa _ @xcite . in the particular case of pure states , the qd is equal to the entropy of entanglement and also equal to the classical correlation in eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) , i.e. , @xmath14 @xcite , independent of the choice of the partition @xmath5 . on the other hand , for mixed states",
    "the entanglement is only a part of this general nonclassical correlation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the qd may be distributed into entanglement and an additional quantum correlation as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , some symmetric measures of correlations were proposed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the classical correlation in a composed bipartite system may be defined as the maximum mutual information obtained via a complete set of local von neumann measurements over both partitions of a composite state @xmath0 : @xmath15 ) \\text{,}\\label{scc}\\ ] ] where the local projective - measurement map , @xmath16 $ ] , ( lpmm ) is explicitly given by @xmath17=\\sum_{i , j}\\pi_{i}^{a}\\otimes\\pi_{j}^{b}(\\rho_{ab})\\pi_{i}^{a}\\otimes\\pi_{j}^{b}\\text{,}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we define the quantum counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ scc ] ) as @xmath20 the quantum correlation defined in eq .",
    "( [ sqc ] ) can be seen as a symmetric version of the quantum discord ( sqd ) , since it also reveals a departure between the quantum and classical versions of information theory , i.e. , the different nature of the measurement process .",
    "such a symmetrized version of the quantum discord was recently employed in an experiment to investigate the quantumness of correlations in a spin system , at room temperature , in a nuclear magnetic resonance setup @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that both qd and sqd , as defined here , are not monotonic under local quantum operations ( lo ) .",
    "in fact , such quantities should be understood as upper bounds for the quantum nature of correlations .",
    "we observe also that , as mutual information is monotonic under lo @xcite , it follows @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , we prove bellow ( following @xcite ) that @xmath22 if and only if the state @xmath0 is the incorporation of a classical probability distribution in the quantum formalism , i.e. , the so called classical - classical state @xcite .",
    "_ theorem .",
    "_ @xmath22 if and only if the state @xmath0 can be cast in the form @xmath23 .",
    "( here @xmath24 is a complete set of projectors for the subsystem @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a probability distribution . )    _ proof .",
    "first we assume @xmath27 .",
    "if we apply the lpmm in the eigenbasis of @xmath0 it remains undisturbed and , as a consequence , @xmath28)=i(\\{p_{i , j}\\})=i(\\rho_{ab})$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath22 .",
    "now we assume @xmath22 , which implies @xmath29)$ ] . if @xmath30 is taken as the lpmm attaining the maximum in the right hand side of the last equation , then @xmath31)$ ] . using the petz s theorem ( see @xcite and _ lemma 2 _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we see that the last equation implies the existence of lo @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34=\\sum_{i , j}\\tilde{p}_{ij}\\lambda^{a}[\\tilde{\\pi}_{i}^{a}]\\otimes\\lambda^{b}[\\tilde{\\pi}_{j}^{b}]$ ] .",
    "let us now consider the following state : @xmath35=\\sum_{i}\\tilde{p}_{i}\\tilde{\\pi}_{i}^{a}\\otimes\\sum_{j}\\frac{\\tilde{p}_{ij}}{\\tilde{p}_{i}}\\lambda^{b}[\\tilde{\\pi}_{j}^{b}]=\\sum_{i}\\tilde{p}_{i}\\tilde{\\pi}_{i}^{a}\\otimes\\tilde{\\rho}_{i}^{b}$ ] . as mutual information does not increases under lo , we have @xmath36)\\ge i(\\rho^{cq}_{ab})$ ] . but @xmath37=\\sum_{i , j}\\tilde{p}_{ij}\\tilde{\\pi}_{i}^{a}\\otimes\\tilde{\\pi}_{j}^{b}$ ] can be obtained from @xmath38 through a lo applied to the subsystem @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath36)\\le i(\\rho^{cq}_{ab})$ ] , which leads to @xmath36)=i(\\rho^{cq}_{ab})$ ] .",
    "however , it is known from the holevo s bound @xcite , that @xmath40)$ ] if and only if all @xmath41 commute , where @xmath42 is the holevo s quantity",
    ". therefore @xmath38 is of the form @xmath23 .",
    "finally , by defining @xmath43 $ ] and using the same reasoning as above we see that @xmath0 also must take the form @xmath23 , completing the proof .",
    "any two - qubit state can be brought through local unitaries to the following form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the @xmath49th component of the pauli operator acting on the state space of partition @xmath50 .",
    "the identity operator acting on the state space @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 was defined as * * @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "let us first compute the symmetric classical ( [ scc ] ) and quantum ( [ sqc ] ) correlations regarding the class of two - qubit states with maximal mixed marginals ( bell - diagonal states ) @xmath57 .",
    "these states are obtained by choosing @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ 2qubits ] ) .",
    "now the coefficients @xmath59 are constrained such that the eigenvalues of @xmath57 , @xmath60 /4 $ ] ( @xmath61 ) , are not negative . since @xmath62 the total correlation in this class of states",
    "is given by @xmath63 .",
    "if the system is prepared in the state @xmath57 the two - side measured density operator reads @xmath64 and the reduced measured density operator is @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath66 and the symmetric classical correlation ( [ scc ] ) can be written as @xmath67 following @xcite , any projective measurement can be obtained through a @xmath68 rotation @xmath69 on a projector @xmath70 as @xmath71 with @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 is the standard computational basis for the partition @xmath5 * * , * * with * * @xmath74 . by using the fact that @xmath75 are the generators for the @xmath76 group we can write @xmath77 , where @xmath78 with @xmath79 @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath69 implies that @xmath82 . using this definition for @xmath69 ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath83 where we set @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath87 . if we define @xmath88 and replace eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ mmmm ] ) the measured density operator reads @xmath89 and has the following eigenvalues spectrum @xmath90   \\right/   4 $ ] , with @xmath91 .",
    "the minimization of the measured density operator entropy , @xmath92 , is obtained by maximizing the absolute value of @xmath93 . for this purpose",
    "it is helpful to note that @xmath94 where we defined @xmath95 .",
    "the last inequality is saturated to an equality if the measurement directions are the same in both partitions @xmath96 and @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus the maximum of @xmath100 is obtained choosing @xmath79 appropriately .",
    "for example , if @xmath101 we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled with @xmath104 and @xmath105 or with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the other alternatives , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , are obtained using the same reasoning .",
    "thus the symmetric classical correlation ( [ scc ] ) in the state @xmath57 can be analytically obtained and it is given by @xmath110\\text{. } \\label{acc}\\ ] ] the expression ( [ acc ] ) for the symmetric classical correlation ( [ scc ] ) of two - qubit states with maximal mixed marginals , @xmath57 , coincide with the expression obtained by luo @xcite for the asymmetric classical correlation ( [ cc ] ) in this case .",
    "therefore , for this class of states , the sqd @xmath111 reduces to the asymmetric qd , in other words @xmath112 for @xmath113 or @xmath39 .",
    "for the sake of introducing explicit examples of classes of states for which the quantum discord may not be a convenient quantifier of quantum correlation , we use the x - real class of states @xmath114 .",
    "these states are obtained from ( [ 2qubits ] ) by choosing @xmath115 @xmath116 and have the following spectrum of eigenvalues : @xmath117/4 $ ] , with @xmath61 .",
    "the reduced state entropy is given by @xmath118/2\\}\\log _",
    "{ 2}\\{[1+(-1)^{i}\\varsigma_{3}]/2\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "thus the total correlation in @xmath114 is @xmath121 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors obtained an analytical expression for asymmetric classical correlation [ eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) ] , and thus for the qd , in x - real states .",
    "this expression is given by @xmath122,@xmath123 $ ] , where the conditional entropies are given by @xmath124-s(\\rho_{y}^{x})$ ] and @xmath125/2\\}\\log_{2}\\{[1+(-1)^{i}\\sqrt{\\varsigma_{3}^{2}+c^{2}}]/2\\}$ ] , with @xmath126 , @xmath127 or @xmath128 , @xmath113 and @xmath129 .",

    "however for @xmath141 we can obtain @xmath142 ) depending on the state regarded .",
    "for instance , if @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( or equivalently for @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) , and @xmath137 the qd obtained by measuring @xmath96 ( @xmath143 ) or @xmath39 ( @xmath144 ) always yields different values .",
    "the absolute value of the difference between the two quantifiers , @xmath145 , is plotted in fig .",
    "the extreme situation is obtained for @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( or @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) . in this case the measurement in one partition results in a zero value for the qd while a nonzero value is obtained by measuring the other partition .",
    "thus , if we regard the correlation between the two qubits as a shared property , qd may be not a convenient quantifier for quantum correlations in this case , although it still can be used as an indicator in a proper way ( we have to compute the two asymmetric versions of qd ) .",
    "in summary , we briefly analyzed some symmetric and asymmetric measures of correlations .",
    "considering a two - qubit composed system , we obtained an analytical formula for a symmetric version of quantum discord for bell - diagonal states .",
    "we show that in this case the sqd and qd are equivalent .",
    "we also pointed out the fact that , if correlation is regarded as a shared property , quantum discord may be not convenient to quantify quantum correlation in a general scenario due to its asymmetry with respect to the chosen partition to be measured . as illustrated in sec . 4 , such asymmetry can leads us to find different values for the amount of correlations shared between the two qubits , depending on the choice of the measured partition . in this case",
    ", the asymmetric quantum discord may be regarded as an indicator of nonclassical correlations , but an appropriate strategy to compute it must be adopted .",
    "we then observe that a symmetrized version of quantum discord could be more convenient to quantify quantum correlations in general scenarios",
    ". an important open problem , which must be addressed in the future , is related with the investigation of the optimization process in sqd through a generic povm .",
