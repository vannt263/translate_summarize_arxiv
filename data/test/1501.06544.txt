    "after the completion of the operations for lhc run - i , the most important legacy for the whole of particle physics is the existence of a higgs boson with a mass of about 126 gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as a result of combined data from various higgs search channels , it was established that the observed higgs boson has properties which are consistent with those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs state  @xcite .    however , it is natural to be left with a key question .",
    "namely , what is the actual number of scalar doublet fields present in nature ?",
    "although the higgs sector in the sm is constructed of only one isospin doublet field , that is not supported by a fundamental principle .",
    "in fact , it is well known that multi - doublet models can be considered so that the higgs boson phenomenology is consistent with current lhc data by arranging additional parameters suitably , and they are often introduced new physics models beyond the sm .",
    "for example , supersymmetry - extended models require at least two doublets in their higgs sector for gauge anomaly cancellation and to construct the yukawa lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "a second doublet field is introduced also in many radiative neutrino mass models  @xcite .",
    "the inert doublet model ( idm )  @xcite , aka a 2-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with one active and one inert doublet , has been proposed to explain the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , by depriving a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the second doublet field and making it non - interacting with sm fields except for the ( thereby active ) higgs boson itself and the gauge states symmetry into the higgs sector , where all the sm particles [ the second doublet ] are assigned to be even [ odd ] under the @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the particles with the odd parity are produced in pairs and the lightest one amongst these is stable , hence a dm candidate . ] .",
    "furthermore , an additional source of cp - violation is obtained in a higgs sector with multiple doublets which is required to realize a successful scenario for electro - weak ( ew ) baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "properties of an enlarged higgs sector clearly depend on the new physics scenario embedding it , so that the determination of the true higgs boson dynamics is extremely important to extract information on the new physics model .",
    "in particular , if a multi - doublet structure is chosen for the higgs sector , what is a mass scale of the additional active and/or inert ( pseudo)scalar bosons ?",
    "how can we extract information on the total number of doublet fields ?",
    "needless to say , the direct way to probe a multi - doublet structure is discovering extra ( pseudo)scalar bosons at collider experiments .",
    "for example , even in the simplest case of 2hdms , there appear a pair of singly - charged ( @xmath6 ) , a cp - odd ( @xmath7 ) and a cp - even ( @xmath8 ) higgs boson in addition to the sm - like higgs boson ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "clearly , the most important property to find these extra scalar bosons is their masses .",
    "although , in general , these masses are taken as free parameters , we may be able to constrain their corresponding parameter space by taking into account theoretical constraints : chiefly , perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability . in 2hdms , the unitarity and vacuum stability bounds have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . by using them , dimensionless parameters in the scalar potential can be constrained , and it can be translated into limits on the mass parameters for the extra ( pseudo)scalar bosons . in particular , when there is a non - zero mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath8 in 2hdms , the exact decoupling limit of the extra scalar boson can no longer be taken , because of the unitarity constraints .",
    "therefore , one can obtain an upper limit on the mass of the extra scalar boson  @xcite .",
    "the argument can be generalized to multi - higgs doublet scenarios .",
    "the effects of a non - zero mixing can appear as deviations in the couplings of @xmath9 with gauge bosons ( @xmath10 ) and/or fermions ( @xmath11 ) from the sm predictions .",
    "hence , the very fact that the latter can be accessed experimentally enables one to extract information on the underlying ( pseudo)scalar dynamics above and beyond the mass scale directly probed at the collider concerned .",
    "take the @xmath10 couplings for example .",
    "they are presently ( i.e. , after lhc run - i ) constrained to be sm - like at the level of 10% or so .",
    "lhc run - ii ( 13 tev ) at standard integrated luminosity ( 300 fb@xmath12 ) would improve this precision by about a factor of 2 .",
    "their expected accuracy will then be about 2%  @xcite at the high - luminosity ( hl ) lhc  @xcite ( with collision energy of 14 tev and integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy is expected to be about 0.4%  @xcite at the international linear collider ( ilc ) with collision energy of 500 gev and integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath12 ( ilc500 ) .",
    "therefore , if a deviation in @xmath10 couplings is discovered at future colliders , whenever this will occur , it will at the same time suggest the possibility of an enlarged higgs sector and , if so , enable one to place an upper limit on the mass of extra ( pseudo)scalar bosons .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate constraints on dimensionless parameters in the scalar potential from the bounds imposed by perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability in 3-higgs doublet models ( 3hdms ) .",
    "the phenomenological importance of such extended higgs scenarios , amongst many possible others , has been emphasized lately in the context of the latest lhc results and dm searches .",
    "for example , 3hdms may shed light on the flavour problem , namely the unknown origin and nature of the three families of quarks and leptons , including neutrinos , and their pattern of masses , mixings and cp violation : it is possible that the three families of quarks and leptons could be described by the same symmetries that describe the three higgs doublets @xcite .",
    "such a family symmetry could be spontaneously broken along with the ew symmetry , although some remnant subgroup could survive , thereby stabilizing a possible scalar dm candidate while for certain symmetries it is possible to find a vev alignment that respects the original symmetry of the potential which will then be responsible for the stabilization of the dm candidate @xcite .",
    "although there are several types of 3hdms depending on symmetries imposed in the scalar potential @xcite@xcite , having in view the aforementioned phenomenological requirements and a need for a simple and predictive formulation , recently , @xmath5 symmetric 3hdms with one or two inert doublets have been investigated and found viable from both a dm and lhc perspective @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other than explaining current data , new regions of dm relic density and areas of parameter space yielding totally new lhc signals ( with respect to , e.g. , 2hdms ) open up @xcite .    herein , we focus on the i(1 + 2)hdm and i(2 + 1)hdm , where the former[latter ] model contains two[one ] active doublets and one[two ] inert doublets .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-wave amplitude matrix for all possible 2to2 body scalar boson elastic scatterings in the high energy limit in both models , including contributions from the sm gauge bosons as the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson states due to the equivalence theorem approximation ( eta ) symmetry to obtain eigenvalues for the @xmath0 wave amplitude matrix . because the symmetry imposed in the higgs potential in our paper is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite , derived eigenvalues are also different .",
    "we have confirmed that our formula for the eigenvalues coincides with those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite by taking appropriate replacements of the coupling constant in the potential .",
    "detailed explanations are given in the end of sec .",
    "iii - b . ] .",
    "we then examine the allowed parameter space from the unitarity and vacuum stability ( re - derived herein and found to be compliant with those in refs .",
    "@xcite ) bounds in addition to the constraints from the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters . then",
    ", as intimated , we proceed to apply the unitarity bounds to obtain an upper limit on the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the i(1 + 2)hdm in the case with a non - zero mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath8 , and study how the limit can be changed as compared to that in 2hdms .",
    "we find that a stronger upper bound is obtained in the i(1 + 2)hdm than that in 2hdms depending on the masses of the inert ( pseudo)scalar bosons .",
    "therefore , we can exclude the i(1 + 2)hdm when the masses of @xmath7 or @xmath8 will be found to be larger than the given upper limit for a fixed amount of the mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath8 . as for the i(2 + 1)hdm , since unitarity here is perfectly realized by the sm - like higgs state @xmath9 , we study what constraints are induced on the various parameters in the potential involving inert states ) in order not to spoil the perturbative behavior of the only active scalar in this scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the scalar potential and mass formulae for the scalar bosons . in sec .",
    "iii , constraints from vacuum stability , perturbative unitarity and the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 parameters are discussed . in sec .",

    "among various classes of 3hdms  @xcite , we discuss the one which satisfies the following requirements :    \\(i ) it contains a sm - like higgs boson ;    \\(ii ) it contains a unique candidate of dm in a given mass spectrum ;    \\(iii ) it does not have flavour - changing neutral current ( fcncs ) at the tree level .    in order to satisfy the requirements of ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", we need at least one active and one inert doublet field . thus , the ( pseudo)scalar sector of our 3hdms must be composed of one inert plus two active doublet fields ; i.e. , i(1 + 2)hdm or two inert plus one active doublet fields ; i.e. , i(2 + 1)hdm . to guarantee a doublet field being inert and the stability of a dm candidate",
    ", we require the corresponding vev to be zero and impose an unbroken discrete @xmath5 symmetry onto the whole doublet sector . a dm candidate",
    "can then be obtained as the lightest neutral ( pseudo)scalar component of the inert doublet field with the odd parity under @xmath5 ( the sm plus the higgs / active ( pseudo)scalar states being even ) . as a consequence",
    ", we also obtain that the inert ( pseudo)scalar states can only appear in pairs in each vertex in the lagrangian , so that they can not couple to fermions directly . in the i(1",
    "+ 2)hdm , fcnc processes via neutral scalar boson mediation appear at the tree level similarly to the generic 2hdm case , because of the existence of two doublet fields with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the simplest way to avoid such fcncs is imposing another discrete @xmath14 symmetry  @xcite which can be softly - broken in general ( henceforth denoted as @xmath15 ) . here , we consider both the i(1 + 2)hm and i(2 + 1)hdm with the two discrete symmetries @xmath5 and @xmath15 symmetry . however , by imposing the @xmath15 symmetry throughout , the structure of the higgs potential can be much simpler than that in the case without it , thereby rendering possible a semi - analytical treatment of unitarity violating processes . in this connection",
    ", it turns out that we can deal with the two models uniformly as seen in the scalar potential ( given below in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) ) .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath13 symmetric potential in both 3hdms . ] .    to write down the scalar potential in the 3hdms , let @xmath16 @xmath17 be isosipin doublet scalar fields , where the assignment of @xmath13 charge is listed in table  [ particle ] .",

    "the yukawa lagrangian in the i(2 + 1)hdm is given in the same form as that in the sm , where @xmath31 gives all the sm fermion masses .",
    "in contrast , in the i(1 + 2)hdm , the structure of the yukawa lagrangian depends on the @xmath15 charge assignments for the sm fermions . in general",

    "this would force the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath72 in the higgs potential to acquire quite large values which must be excluded from the view point of ensuring perturbativity of the model .",
    "this in turn implies that there is an upper limit on the masses of the extra higgs bosons when we consider the case of @xmath73 .",
    "as mentioned previously , one of the aims of this paper is indeed deriving an upper limit for these in the i(1 + 2)hdm by using bounds from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity , which we will discuss in the next section .",

    "thus , the three mixing angles are given by @xmath95    in summary , the inert sector of the i(2 + 1)hdm can be described by nine parameters : i.e. , six masses @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 and three mixing angles @xmath100 ( for @xmath101 ) .",
