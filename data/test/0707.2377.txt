    "malin 1 is a highly unusual disk galaxy characterized by an enormous , hi  rich and extremely low surface brightness disk @xcite .",
    "recent , deep r - band data by moore & parker @xcite show an exponential disk extending out to 124 kpc @xmath0}^{-1}$ ] ( scale length 53 kpc ) .",
    "this corresponds to the hi  extent .",
    "there is also a prominent _ bulge_-like component . according to pickering et al .",
    "@xcite the rotation curve has the slowly rising shape typical of the less luminous , `` dark matter dominated '' lsb galaxies .",
    "this slow rise of the rotation curve in the presence of a luminous central component is in marked contrast with the rule that there is a close correlation between the distribution of light and the shape of the rotation curve @xcite .",
    "however , pickering et al .",
    "@xcite do point out that their rotation curve is very uncertain because of the low resolution of the observations , the low signal / noise ratio and the strong warping .",
    "this has induced us to carry out a re - analysis of the hi  data with special attention for the beam - smearing effects and to make a new comparison with the luminosity profile .",
    "the results of our analysis agree with those of a recent hst optical study of the bright central component @xcite : malin 1 is a normal , early - type galaxy surrounded by a huge , low - surface - brightness outer disk .",
    "atoms @xmath1 with an increment of 4.6@xmath2 atoms @xmath1 .",
    "the hpbw is 21 ",
    "( @xmath329 kpc).,height=340 ]",
    "the hi  data cube obtained with the vla by pickering et al .",
    "@xcite has been re - analyzed .",
    "the large extent of the hi  disk is shown in fig .  1 superposed on the optical ( dss ) image .",
    "the hi  radius corresponds approximately to that of the extended , faint optical disk .",
    "a new velocity field has been derived .",
    "the 21-cm line profiles are strongly affected by beam smearing and are very asymmetric . instead of the intensity - weighted mean velocities used by pickering et al . ,",
    "which suffer heavily from beam smearing , we have taken the velocities at the profile peaks , close to the high rotation velocity side .",
    "subsequently , the rotation curve has been derived from the velocity field following well - known standard procedures .",
    "this rotation curve has been used to construct model data cubes to verify its correctness ( fraternali & sancisi , in preparation ) . the new and the old @xcite rotation curves are shown in fig .  2 ( bottom ) .",
    "amplitude and flat outer part are the same . in the inner parts",
    "the new curve rises much more steeply and reaches higher values inside 20 arcsec ( @xmath330 kpc ) in correspondence of the central concentration in the luminosity profile ( fig .  2 , top ) .",
    "3 shows the `` maximum disk '' decomposition , with isothermal halo and hi  disk . the r - band profile @xcite has been used .",
    "the maximum disk m / l ratio is 5.2 .",
    "this is in the range of the values found for luminous early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the present study is based on a re - analysis of existing hi  observations of malin 1 obtained with the vla .",
    "a new rotation curve has been derived .",
    "this rotation curve shows a close correlation with the luminosity distribution , in line with the `` rule '' suggested by sancisi @xcite .",
    "also in this galaxy the mass seems to follow the light .",
    "the rotation curve has the shape ( steep inner rise ) typical of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "the classical disk - halo decomposition of the rotation curve has shown that a maximum disk solution is possible .",
    "clearly , in its inner luminous part , malin 1 has the characteristics of an early - type hsb galaxy .",
    "barth @xcite has recently published a study of malin 1 based on archival hubble i - band data .",
    "he has examined the structure and the properties of the inner bright parts and has concluded that malin 1 has a normal stellar disk and that , out to a radius of @xmath310 kpc , its structure is that of a typical sb0/a galaxy .    the new hi  analysis and the optical study throw new light on malin 1 and on its dark / luminous matter properties . both point at the same conclusion : malin 1 is a normal , luminous early - type galaxy .",
    "the enigma of the huge ( 120 kpc ) , low - surface - brightness stellar and hi  disk surrounding the bright inner parts remains . in view of the large - scale symmetry and regularity and of the large orbital period ( @xmath33.5 billion years ) in the outer parts",
    ", it seems unlikely that the formation of this extended structure is due to recent accretion and mergers .",
