    "in the last decade a great interest has arisen for the so - called spintronic , or spin - based electronics .",
    "the reason is that the spintronic , due to its low power consumption , promises to be a good alternative to the traditional electronics , based on the charge transport @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin transport is not very dissipative , with low energy losses over long distances , although the relaxation of the spin polarization may exist .",
    "spintronics is a catchall term that refers to the potential use of the spin rather than the charge in electronic devices . for it to be useful in practice , spin up and spin down electronic states ( or hole states ) of any material",
    "must be separated in energy .",
    "also , the material should be electrically polarized as in conventional electronics , which means that carriers , both negative ( electrons ) and positive ( holes ) , must be able to conduct .",
    "a key point is the choice of the material .",
    "for example , narrow gap semiconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath3-based materials seem to be the suitable candidates@xcite due to the long life of the magnetic spin state of photoexcited electrons , which behaves coherently .",
    "it is also important that the materials have a good lattice matching to avoid defects accumulation at the interface and internal strains , which would worsen the transport of the polarized spin .",
    "there exist techniques to relax this strain , as to place step graded buffers with a progressive variation of the @xmath4 concentration between the substrate and the active device .",
    "these layers mainly absorb strain and defects .",
    "another important point is a large land factor for having a significant splitting of spin states by applying small magnetic fields . in general",
    ", @xmath5 structure seems to be one of the most appropriate for spintronic purposes .",
    "this heterostructure offers the possibility of manipulate the gap width , the land factor and the interface contributions by varying @xmath6 and @xmath7 concentrations .",
    "besides , it presents a remarkable spin - splitting energy when a weak magnetic fields is applied .",
    "this peculiarity makes this material suitable for high temperature spin - valves devices .    in this work",
    "we will focus in the spin - splitting changes in asymmetric coupled double quantum wells acqw , caused by abrupt interfaces , when an in - plane magnetic field is applied . for this purpose",
    "we will base on an extended version of the @xmath1 kane formalism with nonsymmetric boundary conditions to calculate the band structure and dispersion laws3 .",
    "although electronic dispersion laws ( and the corresponding spin - orbit splitting ) in quantum heterostructures have been widely studied in the last decades@xcite , many question remain open .",
    "one of them is the influence of heterojunctions on the electron spin tunneling and thus , their contribution to the polarization of this spin . in theory ,",
    "effects from compositional parameters or interface contributions to the spin splitting should be analyzed through the density of states . and",
    "the modifications of the density of states can be directly observed using photoluminescence excitation technique ( ple)@xcite .    in bulk materials spin - orbit interaction",
    "is caused either by a soft potential @xcite and by cubic @xcite and linear @xcite spin - dependent contributions to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , we can reduce the cubic contribution to a linear one after the squared momentum substitution by its quantized value due to confinement 9 .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to consider the additional spin - orbit splitting caused by the interaction with abrupt heterojunction potentials ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this contribution is absolutely different to the contributions mentioned above .    the effect of an  in - plane magnetic field on the energy spectrum in nonsymmetric heterostructures results in the pauli contribution to the electron hamiltonian .",
    "several peculiarities for transport phenomena in heterostructures have been also discussed @xcite . however",
    ", these discussions only consider the mixing between pauli contribution and effective 2d spin - orbit interaction . as mentioned above",
    ", we can not forget the contribution of the abrupt barriers in asymmetric structures ( e.g. acqw ) to the spin splitting , as we will emphasize in this work .",
    "besides , we have included possible changes of the land factor .",
    "although the land @xmath2-factor depends on the applied fields @xcite , this dependence is negligible for in - plane magnetic fields and low electron density .",
    "the model also applies to narrow - gap heterostructures whenever the slow potential generated by doping or external transverse electric fields can be described self - consistently .",
    "we will center our attention in the hamiltonian describing the electronic behavior in the conduction band , considering that any possible strain is already included in the structure through the gap , the conduction and the valence well potentials@xcite .",
    "we will include effects of electric and magnetic fields as well as the interfaces contribution .",
    "based on the assumption that the gap energy @xmath8 is smaller than the energy distance between the valence band ( @xmath9-band ) and the spin - split band extrema , the electronic states in these narrow - gap heterostructures can be described by the three - band kane matrix hamiltonian @xmath10where the generalized kinetic momentum , @xmath11 , contains the vector potential @xmath12 , @xmath13 is an in - plane magnetic field and @xmath14 is written in the @xmath15-representation through the 2d momentum @xmath16 .",
    "we have also introduced the diagonal energy matrix @xmath17 whose elements fix the positions of the band extrema and the interband velocity matrix @xmath18 .    from now on it is necessary to introduce a new index @xmath19  to denote narrow - gap regions ( wells ) and wide - gap regions ( central barrier and lateral sides ) , respectively . in the parabolic approximation",
    "we can write the schrdinger equation for acqw in the form@xcite : @xmath20where the isotropic kinetic energy is given by @xmath21which includes the effective mass @xmath22 .",
    "parabolic approximation is justified because energy values under consideration are smaller than the gap energy @xmath8 in the narrow region .",
    "the @xmath23 energy is @xmath24 in the wells , and @xmath25 in the barriers , where @xmath26 is the band offset for @xmath27 conduction band . whenever energy values are less than @xmath28 underbarrier penetration ( and tunneling ) is permitted and described by the boundary conditions .",
    "the potential @xmath29 , for an uniform transverse electric field , is @xmath30 .",
    "band diagram for acqw is shown in fig . 1 .    the magnetic energy @xmath31 , for not very strong magnetic fields ,",

    "\\label{5}\\ ] ]    the potential of interfaces determines a part of the spin dependent contributions through the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "actually , @xmath38 takes into account the spin - orbit coupling due to the abrupt potential of the heterojunction at each interface , as@xcite @xmath39where the integral is taken over the width of the abrupt interface @xmath40 .",
    "contribution of @xmath38 to the energy dispersion relations will appear through the third kind boundary conditions after a first integration of the schrdinger equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we will detail this point in appendix a.    in the present case , where @xmath29 is linear with @xmath41 ,  we get @xmath42 , which does not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the external applied electric field @xmath43 shapes the spin velocity @xmath44 and the @xmath2-factor , @xmath45 .",
    "we can take the characteristic spin velocity for each layer as @xmath46and the abrupt interface parameter as @xmath47lastly , we introduce the pauli splitting energy @xmath48 , caused by the magnetic field , as @xmath49 .",

    "let s start this section with numerical results for @xmath5-based acqws , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 . we have chosen this particular structure because we have reliable data for basic parameters@xcite .",
    "we have considered two @xmath114 wells of @xmath115 and @xmath116   wide separated by a @xmath117   @xmath118 barrier .",
    "we have also applied an electric field of @xmath119 kv / cm , which corresponds to a spin velocity @xmath120 cm / s for the @xmath114 qws , and @xmath121 cm / s for the @xmath118 barriers , with a transition spin velocity region across de abrupt interface .",
    "this electric field is slightly higher than needed to achieve resonance between the deepest levels of both wells ( @xmath122 kv / cm ) . to calculate interface contributions",
    "we have used a typical abrupt interface size of @xmath123  for @xmath124@xcite .",
    "we have also applied in - plane magnetic field of @xmath125 t , small enough to allow the anticrossing close to the bottom of energy dispersion relations ( zero slope points ) .",
    "figures 2@xmath126 show normalized squared wave function for @xmath127 , versus @xmath41 and the dimensionless momentum @xmath128 , where @xmath129 upper panels @xmath130 correspond to the first deepest level for the two different spin orientations . as expected for an electric field beyond the resonance , charge density is mainly located in the left narrow qw .",
    "consequently , the opposed happens for the second resonant level as can be seen in the lower panels @xmath131 analyzing wave functions versus momentum @xmath132 and spin orientations by comparing panels @xmath133 and @xmath134 , a particular behavior occurs .",
    "while the charge distribution coincide for both down and up spins at the zone center ( @xmath135 ) , there is a tunneling charge transfer between wells for increasing @xmath136 . for spin down case [ panel @xmath137 charge",
    "enhances tunneling from left narrow well to the right wide one .",
    "tunneling shows opposite behavior for spin up electrons [ panel ( @xmath138 ) ] and charge goes from the right to the left well .",
    "lower panels @xmath131 correspond to the higher resonant level , mainly at the right well .",
    "it might seem the behavior is the opposite to the previous one because now , spin down case [ panel @xmath139 shows a tunneling increase from right to left qw as @xmath140 increases and , conversely , for spin up electrons [ panel @xmath141 .",
    "however , considering the relative charge concentration between wells , we can realize there is a similar behavior for both resonant levels . for spin down electrons",
    "there is a charge shift from well with higher concentration to the other well [ panels @xmath133 , @xmath142 and conversely for the spin up electrons [ panels @xmath134 , @xmath143 .",
    "the reason for this charge shift lies in the magnetic energy term @xmath144 , which induces a breaking of the  @xmath132 momentum symmetry . because of @xmath145 is an essential part of the argument of the airy functions ,",
    "the behavior of the wave functions is significantly affected .",
    "3 shows the near parabolic dispersion relations of the two coupled levels and their corresponding spin down and up sublevels , for the electric and magnetic fields under consideration .",
    "it can be seen the @xmath146 paraboloids symmetry according to eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "although there is a little difference between spin paraboloids , due to the large energy difference between the resonant levels of both wells ( @xmath14712 mev ) and the splitting of the spin sublevels ( @xmath1470.01 mev at @xmath127 ) it is not possible to distinguish minima behavior .",
    "thus , we have enlarged in fig .",
    "4 the bottom of the pair of paraboloids ( spin down and spin up ) for the ground level . as expected , both paraboloids shift in opposite @xmath132 directions resulting in a sublevel anticrossing .",
    "this displacement is due not only to the magnetic field but also to the electric one ( 12 ) .    considering a @xmath127 section of the former figure we can get a more accurate 2d representation ( fig .",
    "5 ) of the anticrossing , minima @xmath132 position , and energy splitting .",
    "the inset displays anticrossing area enlargement . in this kind of anticrossing the slope of @xmath75",
    "varies without changing the sign .",
    "however , as we will see below for the low magnetic fields under study , we work in the region where van hove singularities remain in the density of states . in order to have a more detailed overview of the anticrossing region we have also included in fig .",
    "6 the contour plot around anticrossing for different constant energy values .    next , we analyze the density of states @xmath148 .",
    "this function is related to several spin and interwell tunneling properties .",
    "also , it is proportional to the photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) intensity , one of the most used techniques to get information of quantum structures @xcite . as mentioned before , we have found remains of the van hove singularities for fields under consideration .",
    "so , we have used magnetic field intensities varying from @xmath149 to @xmath150 t to analyze singularities behavior . the shape of @xmath148 is shown in fig . 7 . note that , when @xmath151 t , energy paraboloids shift a certain amount @xmath152 because of the @xmath153 dependence on the electric field . in this case , because both paraboloids bottom are at the same energy , we have clear @xmath154 type singularities in each subband . as expected ,",
    "these peaks disappear gradually by growing magnetic field because of the different vertical paraboloids shift , which leads to a greater slope at the anticrossing point . in turn",
    ", interfaces contribute with a manifested delay in the quenching of the @xmath148 singularities , as well as an additional broadening of these peaks .",
    "that is , although the singularities should only appear at zero magnetic field , they still remain at the band anticrossing position for low magnetic fields , as shown in fig .",
    "another significant feature is that the @xmath148 anticrossing peak is softened when increasing barrier height , disappearing for lower magnetic fields than used in this work@xcite    finally , fig .",
    "8 shows ple spectra for different gaussian halfwidth @xmath106 at a fixed @xmath155 t. for the magnetic field used before ( @xmath156 t ) the two adjacent peaks , corresponding to each resonant pair of states , overlap .",
    "thus , we have used a magnetic field ten times higher because this field allows us to tell the peaks apart for small @xmath106 values .",
    "evolution of the first two peaks with @xmath106 is depicted in fig .",
    "as can be seen , ple peaks corresponding to the two different spin transitions are still distinguishable for @xmath106  values beyond @xmath157 mev .",
    "these results show the same general behavior than available experimental data@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the electron spin behavior in narrow - gap acqws under transverse electric and in - plane magnetic fields , including the role of abrupt interfaces .",
    "we used the kane model with nonsymmetric boundary conditions , caused by the two different wells width , to solve the eigenvalue problem .",
    "based in this model and the transfer matrix approach we have performed a useful tool to tackle any layered structure with abrupt interfaces and subjected to different perturbations . to do that we have implemented @xmath1 matrices for the boundary conditions to describe near - parabolic dispersion relations .",
    "the model allows us the study of the spin peculiarities of levels anticrossing .    because interface contributions oppose intrinsic spin - orbit effect , mechanisms that mix the pauli contribution with the two kinds of spin - orbit contributions ( from a low magnetic field and from heterojunctions ) are different . as a result , numerical calculations for @xmath124 structures lead to magnetoinduced variations of the energy dispersion relations , under very low in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "this effect is particularly  appreciable at anticrossings .",
    "as dispersion relations are used to obtain the density of states , this function is also affected by the abrupt interfaces : a new kind of @xmath148singularity , which does not disappear when increasing magnetic fields , appears .",
    "furthermore , there is an energy broadening of the peaks .    finally , we have calculated ple intensity because , as mentioned before , mid - infrared ple spectroscopy is a suitable technique to find characteristics of energy spectrum@xcite .",
    "this technique provides direct information of the energy spectrum when interband transitions are modified by in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "since , for our purposes , a thorough analysis of the band structure little contributes to describe eigenstates , the main conclusions of this work remain valid .",
    "we have also used along the work the assumption that the confined potential is well described .",
    "thus , the effective transverse field @xmath158 provides correct estimations both for magnetoinduced changes and for the character of the dispersion laws . however , more detailed numerical calculations are needed to describe the kinetic behavior .",
    "we will return to this point in a forthcoming work where we will analyze the spin dynamics in acqws . in summary",
    ", we have shown the importance of the contribution from the interfaces , in narrow gap structures , to the spin polarization through the electronic dispersion relations , and how this contribution can be detected by ple .",
    "the model can be extended to the analysis of the negative magnetoresistance@xcite as well as peculiarities of the spin current through adqw@xcite",

    "<S> we have included the land @xmath2-factor dependence on the external applied field . also , we have calculated electron density of states and photoluminescence excitation . </S>",
    "<S> variations of the electron spin - splitting energy lead to marked peculiarities in the density of states . because the density of states is directly related to photoluminescence excitation , </S>",
    "<S> these peculiarities are observable by this technique . </S>"
