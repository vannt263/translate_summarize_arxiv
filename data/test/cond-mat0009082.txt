    "recently a lot of interest has centered on the so - called small - world networks ( swn)@xcite where an underlying regular lattice is supplemented with additional links ( bonds ) , a fact which drastically reduces the minimal distances ( the so - called chemical distances in the fractal literature ) between pairs of points on the lattice@xcite .",
    "this question is of utmost importance for general network structures , say internet - links@xcite , and for the spreading of diseases@xcite , topics which depend on the minimal distances . on the other hand",
    "other questions are envisageable over such structures , for example random transport@xcite ; this requires solving diffusion - type problems , which are mathematically described by the laplacian on the structure@xcite and the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors@xcite .",
    "examples of such problems are anomalous transport of charges and of excitations over networks@xcite .",
    "most recent swn - studies center on a one - dimensional chain supplemented with additional links ( al ) , which connect sites that are arbitrarily far from each other on the underlying lattice .",
    "while this being the simplest swn envisageable , there are situations in which links between distant sites occur naturally ; however , their lengths are then not necessarily uniformly distributed : considering a polymer chain in solution , monomers which are far apart along the backbone can be quite close to each other in real space , so that for instance energy transfer over the structure may take crosscuts along sites near to each other in space@xcite . now the probability of having such close monomer pairs is related to the return to the origin of random walks , possibly under self - avoiding constraints . in this case",
    "the probability @xmath0 that two sites far apart along the backbone get close together in space , goes approximately as an inverse power - law of their mutual chemical distance @xmath1@xcite : @xmath2 in this work , we will focus on networks constructed as in the swn case , while however letting the additional bonds be distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "we call these structures generalized small - world networks ( gswn ) .",
    "clearly , the original swn is recovered from the gswn by letting @xmath3 . on the other hand , in gswn with @xmath4",
    "practically only sites which are already very close on the chain get to be connected ; such gswn have ( apart from disorder ) properties similar to the underlying regular lattice .",
    "most interesting are gswn with @xmath5 , which show a wealth of features , because of the long - range character of the additional links .    in this paper we will study random walks over gswn , and especially the probability @xmath6 of the walker being ( still or again ) at the origin ; as discussed in previous works@xcite , this quantity reflects many of the properties of the density of eigenvalues of the underlying structure , and is easily obtainable by very effective , easy to program numerical procedures .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ def ] ) we discuss the construction of gswn in more detail . in sec .",
    "[ rel ] we study the behavior of random walkers on gswn .",
    "we find that for @xmath7 well below @xmath8 we have a behavior qualitatively similar to that of walkers over the swn .",
    "however , for @xmath7 larger than @xmath8 we move towards another regime , quite reminiscent of random walks on regular lattices .",
    "the transition appears to happen around @xmath9 , which prompts us to consider transient versus recurrent walks in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] . in this section",
    "we determine analytically @xmath6 for a mean field variant of the gswn model , which we then compare with the numerical findings @xmath6 on gswn .",
    "it turns out that the mean - field approach is related to lvy flights and lvy walks .",
    "finally we close our paper by summarizing our conclusions in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "the construction of gswn follows at first the swn procedure closely : we start from a ring of @xmath10 sites ( i.e. a closed , regular @xmath11d lattice ) .",
    "then we consider each site consecutively , and let it sprout with probability @xmath12 an additional bond , which connects it to another site , see fig .",
    "we now let @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) be the conditional probability that this bond gets attached to a site at the ( minimal ) chemical distance @xmath1 from the sprouting site , measured along the ring . here , given our periodic boundary conditions , the chemical distance @xmath1 lies between @xmath11 and int@xmath13 , where int@xmath14 denotes the largest integer @xmath15 such that @xmath16 ( see fig . [ ring ] ) .",
    "note that through @xmath0 our model differs from the standard swn , where no @xmath1 dependence is accounted for . in eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , the constant @xmath17 normalizes the distribution so that @xmath18 now the exponent @xmath7 in eq .  ( [ powerlaw ] ) is a parameter of the model and will be varied in the following . for a finite system we can choose it freely ,",
    "so that @xmath19 .",
    "in fact the choice @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 recovers one of the basic constructions of the swn , by which connections to all sites but the source are equiprobable . for an infinite network , on the other hand , care has to be exercised ; in order to keep eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) normalizable one has to have @xmath22 .",
    "we now turn to the basic procedure , in which the structure of the model enters through its connectivity matrix @xmath23 .",
    "now @xmath23 is defined as follows : the off - diagonal elements of @xmath23 , namely @xmath24 with @xmath25 , equal _ minus _ the number of links between the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the network .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath28 count the total number of bonds connected to @xmath26 .",
    "hence the connectivity matrix is symmetric and one has @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore @xmath30 and exactly one eigenvalue of @xmath23 , say @xmath31 , vanishes .",
    "one should note that from the spectrum of the @xmath23 matrix one can determine e.g. the diffusion and vibrational properties of the structure , as well as its behavior in external fields@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath23 for the swn ( @xmath20 ) has been recently studied by monasson@xcite ; among his findings was the existence of a pseudo - gap in the density of states , a property which affects the long time diffusion properties@xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath23 can be viewed as arising from two sources : one term , @xmath32 , is deterministic and is due to the underlying regular lattice ( here the ring ) .",
    "another one , @xmath33 , is stochastic and arises from the randomly added links .",
    ". now formally @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 otherwise , where we identify site @xmath38 with @xmath11 ( periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the entries in @xmath39 are random , and for @xmath25 equal @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , letting @xmath1 be the chemical distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath25 ) , one has for the probability @xmath43 that @xmath44 @xmath45 the diagonal elements are , as before , determined from the requirement that@xmath46 .",
    "we close on a small note of caution by remarking that , due to our prescription , even for @xmath47 , the elements @xmath39 are not independent of each other .",
    "thus if @xmath48 for @xmath25 , then for @xmath49 one can not have @xmath50 ; a nondiagonal element having a value of @xmath42 implies namely both for @xmath27 and for @xmath51 , that one of their additional bonds has started at @xmath26 . by construction , however , @xmath26 can only be the source of one additional bond . for decreasing @xmath12 and increasing @xmath10 , however , we expect such correlations between the @xmath39 to be less and less important .",
    "as a simple dynamical problem on the underlying structure , we focus now on the probability for a random walker to be ( still or again ) at the origin of its walk at a later time .",
    "this quantity is fundamental for fractal lattices , where it leads directly to the spectral ( harmonic ) dimension@xcite , a quantity of much importance@xcite . as we have shown in a previous work ,",
    "determining this quantity through a numerical cellular automaton procedure is quite straightforward and very revealing for swn@xcite .",
    "we look at the probability @xmath52 for the walker to be at site @xmath26 at time @xmath53 , given that it started at site @xmath54 at time @xmath55 .",
    "one notes first that @xmath52 obeys the following master equation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a transition rate . in vector notation",
    "@xmath58 this relation reads : @xmath59 and has the formal solution : @xmath60 now the initial condition is @xmath61 with a single non - zero element at @xmath54 .",
    "the probability that the walker is again at @xmath54 at time @xmath53 reads @xmath62_m=\\sum_j \\left[\\exp\\left(-\\sigma { \\mathbb a}t\\right)\\right]_{mj}[{\\mathbf p}^{(m)}(0)]_j=\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\sigma { \\mathbb a}t\\right)\\right]_{mm}\\ ] ] this expression simplifies by averaging over all starting points , since then @xmath63 holds , where tr denotes the trace operation and @xmath64 with @xmath65 are the eigenvalues of the ( symmetric ) connectivity matrix @xmath23 . note that in eq .",
    "( [ relax ] ) because of the averaging over all initial points only the eigenvalues enter .",
    "furthermore one can now readily average over different realizations , obtaining ( since @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the spectral density for @xmath69 .",
    "we turn now to our calculations , by which we determine numerically @xmath6 for different choices of @xmath7 and @xmath12 . for systems of size",
    "@xmath70 we construct the connectivity matrix , diagonalize it , and employ eq .",
    "( [ relax ] ) to evaluate @xmath6 .",
    "we use for each choice of @xmath7 and @xmath12 @xmath71 realizations to average over the structural disorder . in fig .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) we display on double logarithmic scales @xmath6 versus the dimensionless time @xmath72 for @xmath73 and for @xmath7 ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath74 .",
    "first we note that for very long times , @xmath6 reaches the constant value @xmath75 , which arises due to the eigenvalue @xmath76 . increasing",
    "the size of the small - world network ( i.e. @xmath10 ) pushes the long time plateau to lower values , but , as we have shown in an earlier work for @xmath20@xcite , leaves the @xmath6 curves above the plateau practically unaffected .",
    "this is also what we find here for general @xmath7 ; this allows us to infer the qualitative features of @xmath6 in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "turning now to the discussion of the results , we note first that for @xmath20 they agree perfectly with our previous small - world network analysis@xcite , which was based not on the diagonalization of @xmath78 but on a cellular automaton method .",
    "the decay of @xmath6 follows at early times a power - law , which turns at later times into a stretched exponential behavior .",
    "asymptotically , the decay obeys to leading order the form @xmath79@xcite ( with @xmath80 a constant ) , which follows from the spectral density of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath81 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ p1 ] the curves flatten with increasing @xmath7 , a sign that with growing @xmath7 , a walker is less prone to get far away from its starting site . at early times",
    "@xmath6 is little affected by variations in @xmath7 , since at very short times it does not matter whether the al bring the walkers very far away or not .",
    "the transition to pure power - law behavior appears to happen roughly around @xmath82 .    moving on to larger @xmath12 to examine whether this transition depends on @xmath12 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ p2 ] the results for @xmath83 . in this case",
    "there are more al , and the results are more sensitive to the value of @xmath7 : in fig .",
    "[ p2 ] the cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 are easily distinguished .",
    "however , increasing @xmath7 further does not change the curves significantly . the curves are also more spread out in the short - time domain than in the case @xmath73 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quasi 1-dimensional behavior of the walk is mainly felt on distances of the order of @xmath86 , this being a measure of the mean distance between branching points@xcite .",
    "we hasten to note that for very small times ( not displayed on the fig .",
    "[ p2 ] ) the curves for different @xmath7 do coincide . despite these differences , the qualitative behavior of the curves on fig .",
    "[ p1 ] and fig .",
    "[ p2 ] is comparable .",
    "furthermore , the cross - over behavior of @xmath82 ( given as a dotted line ) appears even more clearly on fig .",
    "[ p2 ] : the curves with @xmath87 follow power - law decays closely , while the curves for @xmath88 are partly concave , thus displaying a faster than power - law decay .",
    "let us briefly recall some terminology from the theory of random walks .",
    "a random walk is said to be recurrent , if it returns with probability @xmath11 to the origin at some later time .",
    "otherwise the walk is called transient . for a walk to be transient requires an infinite system , because in finite systems all walks ( disregarding situations with traps , mortal walkers , etc ) are recurrent . on homogenous lattices ,",
    "a walk is transient if and only if @xmath89 is finite . in line with this",
    ", we could expect walks on the gswn with small @xmath7 to be transient , given that for a stretched exponential behavior ( @xmath90 ) : @xmath91 moreover , in the opposite limit of large @xmath7 , we observe that @xmath6 follows a power - law decay with the exponent being nearly @xmath92 .",
    "it follows that for large @xmath7 we have @xmath93 , an indication that the walk is recurrent .",
    "as we discuss in detail in the following , for walks on an infinite regular linear chain whose steps are long - ranged and obey eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) for the step - lengths , the transition between recurrence and transience occurs at @xmath82@xcite .",
    "it is now tempting to aim at explaining our findings of sec .  [ rel ] along such lines .",
    "such a connection is achieved by replacing the random small - world network - structure under investigation here by a regular one ( a mean - field type approach ) , and letting the transition rates reflect the underlying statistics of the links@xcite . in this way",
    "the probability of taking a step of length @xmath94 is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "however , as we show in the following , this regularizing approach is not particularly succesful , since it does not describe @xmath6 well for small and moderate @xmath7 .",
    "we start now from the so - called the riemann walks@xcite , which are symmetric random walks on the linear chain , where each step of the walk can extend over the length @xmath1 with probability @xmath96 such walks are recurrent for @xmath97 and transient for @xmath88@xcite .",
    "riemann - walks are examples from the more general class of lvy flights and lvy walks@xcite .",
    "turning now to the problem of averaging both the gswn structures and the random - walks over them , we simply replace in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) @xmath98 ( remember that @xmath99 ) by its average @xmath100 over all gswn . for the averaging we may use eq .  ( [ distr ] ) and obtain @xmath101 where @xmath1 is the chemical distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 . by doing this we have now as connectivity matrix @xmath102 , whose eigenvalues @xmath103 are readily found ; they read ( for @xmath10 odd ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 . now",
    "( [ eigenvalues ] ) can be used to determine numerically @xmath6 via eq .",
    "( [ avrelax ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ mft ] we compare for @xmath70 , @xmath73 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath20 the results of the two approaches . for @xmath106",
    "the two methods lead to a nice agreement ; it seems that for @xmath7 around or larger than @xmath74 the fluctuations due to the disorder play only a minor role . on the other hand ,",
    "as exemplified by @xmath107 and @xmath20 , for @xmath7 below @xmath8 the mean field approach leads to @xmath6-forms which are quite different from those obtained in sec .",
    "in this work we have studied a new variant of the small - world network ( swn ) model which takes into account the fact that the probability of adding links can depend on the chemical distance between the connected sites .",
    "exemplarily , here we have taken the probability distribution to be a power law ( with exponent @xmath7 ) of the chemical distance , see eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "we have focused on random walks and especially on the probability @xmath6 of a random walker to be at its origin . depending on the value of @xmath7 we have found qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "specifically , we found clues indicating that in the infinite system limit random walks on gswn may change from being transient to being recurrent , as @xmath7 crosses the marginal value of @xmath8 from below .",
    "moreover , we have shown that our model is related to lvy flights and to riemann walks .",
    "we also found that a simple mean - field regularization of the gswn - problem gives poor results for small @xmath7 .",
    "overall , it follows that gswn with @xmath88 are objects whose dynamical properties differ significantly from those of regular lattices ."
