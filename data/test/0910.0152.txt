    "a practical single photon source should meet the demands of high fidelity , brightness and efficiency . as a source of photon pairs , parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) enables conditional state preparation  heralding on one of the twin photons ( idler ) gives exact timing information about the other ( signal ) .",
    "in addition to this , single pass pdc sources have the advantage of operational simplicity and the quality of the quantum state preparation is mainly limited by the available detectors .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated a full tomographic characterization of fock states or photon added / subtracted states prepared from the pdc emission in the low gain regime  @xcite .",

    "this effect becomes prominent at higher gains i.e. if high preparation rates are needed .",
    "in addition to photon - number correlation , spectral correlation between the pdc photon pairs can not be avoided in conventional sources  @xcite .",
    "although the spectral correlation is a useful resource for the generation of highly entangled states  @xcite , the preparation of non - gaussian states in one of the twin modes leads to mixedness whenever the other field mode is traced out  @xcite .    in the past",
    ", the manipulation of the spectral properties has been in the interest of broadband and efficient non - linear classical frequency conversion  @xcite .",
    "more recently , tailoring these properties has been suggested as a method of source engineering for quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "several sophisticated methods have been proposed for state decorrelation , which unfortunately often require means that are available only under specific conditions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the decorrelation of the pdc photons is always possible via spectral filtering , which drastically changes the shape of the spectral correlation function .",

    "in addition to the optimal state preparation , a precise characterization of the prepared photonic states both in photon - number and spectral degrees of freedom is required .",

    "their impact on the state preparation can be studied via hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) type interference , originally applied to observe the temporal length of pdc photons  @xcite .",

    "two indistinguishable photons impinging simultaneously on the different ports of the beam splitter bunch together and no coincidences are detected .",
    "thus , the measurement of hom interference dip between signal and idler is a measure of their spectral indistinguishability , or in other words of their equity  @xcite .",
    "however , for characterizing the fidelity of the prepared single photon , one must employ an independent , spectrally pure reference field , which can be a highly attenuated coherent state .",
    "the measurement of hom interference between these two independent sources allows to quantify their spectral overlap , as evidenced in several studies  @xcite .",

    "our main focus , the characteristics of the filtered state is presented in sections [ sec_statistics ] and [ sec_hom ] ; we study the statistics of the heralded state and finally determine the spectral overlap between signal and reference .",
    "this allows us , to our knowledge for the first time , to directly extract the overall fidelity of a heralded single photon by utilizing the hom interference .",
    "the quantum state of photon pairs generated via pdc is usually described as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the pair creation probability proportional to the pump power , and the labels @xmath2 refer to signal and idler .",
    "the spectral correlation function @xmath3 arises as a consequence of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the former is constrained by the spectrum of the pump pulse @xmath4 and the latter , being governed by the dispersion of the non - linear optical medium of the length @xmath5 , is characterized by the phase - matching ( pm ) function @xmath6 .",
    "we study the spectral correlation in the vicinity of the central frequencies of pump , signal and idler @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , at which @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the grating period @xmath11 of the quasi - phasematched structure can be used for adapting the desired central wavelengths .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we describe the spectrum of the pump by a gaussian envelope @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the detuning from the central wavelength .",
    "in addition , we expand the phase - mismatch @xmath14 appearing in the pm function in first order taylor series around @xmath7 and use the gaussian approximation for the sinc - function .",
    "thus , the pm function can be estimated by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is determined by the group - velocity mismatch of the non - linear medium and the parameter @xmath17 adapts the width of the gaussian to the width of the original sinc - function .",

    "non - vanishing off - diagonal terms correspond to a correlated photonic state .",
    "we stress that these properties can be tailored by modifying the pump bandwidth or the pm properties , e.g. by adjusting the waveguide length .",
    "the width of the ellipse axes are determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath20 and are equal to @xmath21 whereas the tilt can be extracted from the eigenvectors . in the limit of spectrally broadband pump ( @xmath22 )",
    "the tilt @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 and the minor axis of the ellipse is purely determined by the pm properties , @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation](b ) we show the behavior of this width as a function of @xmath5 considering the expected material properties of our wg .",
    "even though this theoretical prediction gives an indication about the pm properties , the actual spectral correlation function needs to be accurately characterized .",
    "this is especially important for waveguided pdc as the non - ideal properties of the guide typically influence the pm function significantly .    in terms of fock state preparation , the joint amplitude of signal and idler in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ellipse ] ) has to be decoupled . to optimally achieve this goal",
    "we employ a short wg , thus broadening the pm bandwidth , and a femtosecond pump , which allows the state decorrelation via a proper design of the spectral filter .",
    "filtering reduces the width of the ellipse s major axis and modifies the correlation such that the ellipse evolves into a circular shape or has a very small remaining tilt .",
    "thence , the bandwidth of the filter has to be matched with the width of the ellipse s minor axis .",
    "one of the most direct ways to characterize the tilt of the spectral correlation ellipse is to measure the unconditional spectral marginal distributions of signal and idler .",
    "the tilt is determined by the simple relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fwhm of the marginal .",
    "however , several spatial modes can propagate in the wg and an accurate determination of the tilt via this method becomes difficult  @xcite .",
    "another possibility relies on detuning the pump wavelength and observing the respective change in the central wavelengths of signal and idler .",
    "similarly , we can also employ narrowband filters in signal and idler arms , and record the wavelengths at which photon - number correlation appears , thus mapping the spectral correlation function .    in all pdc measurements presented in this paper we employed a long , type - ii , periodically poled ktp wg , which was pumped by a frequency doubled ti : sapphire laser operating at ultrafast regime ( , fwhm , autocorrelation length and repetition rate ) .",
    "for the estimation of the ellipse s tilt we separated signal and idler photons in a polarizing beam splitter and launched them into single mode ( sm ) fibers .",
    "the single photon spectra was measured with a sensitive spectrograph ( andor ) and the photon - number correlation with avalanche photo diodes ( apds ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_marginals](a ) .",
    "first of all , we measured the spectral marginal distributions of signal and idler as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_marginals](b ) .",
    "after that , two narrowband interference filters were set on the beam paths of signal and idler and the photon - number correlation was mapped by tuning the filters . for the accurate determination of the ellipse s tilt",
    "the filter wavelengths were recorded with the spectrograph . from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_marginals](c ) we extracted the following value for the tilt : @xmath28 .    regarding the major axis of the correlation ellipse ,",
    "note that its width is highly dependent on the bandwidth of the pump as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation](a ) .",
    "the fwhm of the major axis can be roughly estimated from the marginal distributions by @xmath29 .",
    "our results indicate that pumping the wg with broad pulse leads to an approximately broad major axis , which increases to values between , if the pump is broad .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig_correlation](b ) the exact determination of the pm bandwidth of our wg , i.e. the minor axis of the ellipse , requires sub - nanometer resolution . instead of employing sensitive monochromators , we studied the second harmonic ( sh ) response of the wg . in this process two photons at the fundamental frequency give rise to a single up - converted one .",
    "therefore , the fundamental probe always lies on the line @xmath30 of the @xmath31space , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_shg_response](a ) . in other words",
    ", tuning the frequency of the fundamental probe and measuring the respective sh response allows us to characterize the width of the pm function .",
    "if the fundamental probe is narrow with respect to the pm bandwidth @xmath32 , and the tilt of the pm only slightly deviates from 45@xmath33 , the envelope of the sh response is approximately equal to @xmath34    we recorded the sh response with a grating spectrometer by tuning the fundamental probe ( , fwhm , and autocorrelation length ) in steps of approximately over the phase matching curve [ setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_shg_response](b ) ] . in our case",
    ", the measurement is limited by both the resolution of the spectrograph ( at ) and the bandwidth of the fundamental probe beam .",
    "nevertheless , our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_shg_response](c ) indicate that we can probe the shape of the pm function and that its bandwidth is on the order of the probe bandwidth .    by combining our findings",
    "we are able to reconstruct the correlation ellipse @xmath35 of our photon source . using the estimated values of the tilt and width of the pm , and taking into account a pump with fwhm of",
    "we obtain the ellipse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ellipse_rec](a ) .",
    "the result implies that signal and idler are highly frequency correlated , which is a consequence of the long interaction length of the pdc photons in the wg .",
    "further , our result suggests that the optimal filter bandwidth is on the order of .",
    "unfortunately , spectral filters at with high transmission and narrow bandwidth are rarely available . in consequence",

    "we expect slight remaining correlations after sending the prepared state through these filters as shown in figs  [ fig_ellipse_rec](b ) and [ fig_ellipse_rec](c ) , respectively .",
    "the indistinguishability between signal and idler can be studied via a hom interference , where signal and idler are superimposed in a 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "the full visibility is achieved either if the correlation function is circular , or if it is symmetric with respect to the axis of energy preservation , i.e. if the correlation ellipse is oriented at @xmath36  @xcite . here",
    "we employ this measurement to test and corroborate the acquired knowledge about the spectral ellipse .",
    "we adapt the analysis of avenhaus et al .",
    "@xcite to the study of the hom visibility with spectral filter .",
    "the interference between signal and idler can be characterized by the overlap factor @xmath37 using the gaussian approximation of the spectral correlation function , the overlap factor can be expressed as a product of a spectral ( @xmath38 ) and temporal ( @xmath39 ) overlap i.e. , @xmath40 . while spectral mismatch results from an asymmetric spectral correlation function , temporal mismatch originates from the phase terms , which are ultimately related to the properties of the birefringent media .",
    "these can be inferred from the properties of the correlation ellipse via eq .",
    "( [ eq_pm ] ) .",
    "if perfect overlap was necessary , the temporal mismatch could be compensated with an optical delay line .",
    "the defined overlap factors depend on the ellipse s tilt @xmath23 and aspect ratio @xmath41 , defined as the ratio between the major and minor axes .",

    "since the twin - photons of a type - ii process have orthogonal polarizations , we measured hom interference fringes between signal and idler by rotating a half - wave plate in front of a polarizing beam splitter and recording the coincidence counts between the two output arms .",
    "the experiment was realized in three different cases : ( i ) without spectral filter , ( ii ) including in the setup a spectral filter with fwhm of and , ( iii ) decreasing the width of the filter down to .",
    "the filters were inserted in the joint beam path of signal and idler as shown in fig .",

    "the time delay between p- and s - polarized modes is on the order of . since the temporal width of signal and idler , estimated by the filter bandwidth , is on the order of and no delay line",
    "is inserted in the setup , the temporal overlap can not be neglected in our measurements .",
    "the visibility is defined by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 indicates the amount of coincident counts . in terms of the overlap factor ,",
    "the visibility can also be expressed as @xmath46 .",
    "the classical case , in which signal and idler are completely distinguishable , corresponds to the situation of zero overlap , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "we measured , without any background subtraction , the following visibilities : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , corresponding to each of the above mentioned cases .",
    "the corresponding overlap factors must be compared with the theoretical prediction given in eqs  ( [ eq_o_spectral ] ) and ( [ eq_o_temporal ] ) . for this",
    "we approximate the aspect ratios in a straightforward manner .",
    "when no filtering is applied , @xmath41 is estimated as the ratio of the experimentally extracted major and minor axes , i.e , @xmath51 .",
    "when spectral filtering is applied , we determine @xmath41 as the ratio of the filter bandwidth to the pm width i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , the spectral overlap alone does not explain our results , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_aspect ] . by including the temporal overlap in the analysis ,",
    "the employed model predicts the right tendency , even though in the experiment we do not have any compensation for dispersion or chirp .",
    "we conclude that our model , which includes only experimentally extracted characteristics of the pm , explains with high confidence results of an independent experiment .",
    "in addition , it predicts how the spectral correlation between signal and idler can be manipulated with the selected filter . in the next sections we study how the heralded state is affected by the higher photon - number contributions and remaining spectral correlation .",
    "in the low gain regime heralding of pure signal states is normally realized by considering a single spectral filter at the trigger .",
    "however , at higher gains multiple modes are excited simultaneously .",
    "thus , filtering only the trigger results in the detection of uncorrelated signal modes .",
    "in addition to this , the higher photon number contributions decrease the fidelity of the heralded single - photon state .",
    "we studied these effects by measuring , how the heralded statistics depends on whether or not a narrowband spectral filter is added in the signal arm .",
    "as before , we pumped our pdc source with a frequency doubled ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the pump beam was sent through a simple spatial mode cleaner before being launched into the wg .",
    "after that , the pump was filtered out and the twins were divided into two independent paths . the idler was sent through broad interference filter and , finally , coupled into sm fiber .",
    "we measured the heralded statistics in two different configurations : either without filter or with a 2.5  nm interference filter inserted in the signal arm . the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_setups](b ) was arranged such that the idler was used as a trigger and the statistics of the signal was measured with a `` two - bin tmd '' .",
    "this detector consists of a single 50/50 beam splitter , constructed by using a half - wave plate in front of a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "the loss tolerance of the tmd was achieved by accurate calibration of loss @xmath54 and convolution matrices @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "we understand this result as an indication that , at higher gains , a large amount of distinct spectral modes are excited simultaneously .",
    "if two idler photons are generated there is a high probability that just one of them has a good overlap with the filter mode .",
    "therefore , by using a filter in the signal arm it is possible to reject the signal photon created together with the spectrally mismatched idler .",

    "regarding the single - photon state preparation , the one - photon contribution of the filtered signal was 95% at this trigger rate .",
    "a comparison between the filtered and unfiltered statistics allows us to extract the degree of mode reduction given by the filter . for that , we model the multimode statistics as the convolution of several uniformly occupied spectral modes  @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figs  [ fig_3-fold](a ) and [ fig_3-fold](b ) we show example measurements of the two- and three - fold interference dips that were recorded with reference powers close to the optimized values @xmath132 in fig .",

    "the measured visibilities were @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the temporal width of the interference dips was @xmath135  ps . following eq .",
    "( [ eq_tau ] ) we theoretically study how this width changes as a function of the pm bandwidth [ fig .  [ fig_3-fold](c ) ] .",
    "the comparison of the measurement with our model suggests a fwhm of for the pm , which is in good agreement with the value extracted from sh measurements . further exploring our knowledge about the spectral correlation function , we use eqs .",

    "[ fig_3-fold](c ) we illustrate the theoretical predictions and compare them with the measured overlap values . in the three - fold case we find a good agreement with the model .",
    "however , the measured value of the two - fold overlap deviates largely from the expected one . as no selection of the detection events by triggering",
    "is applied in the two - fold case , we believe that the properties of non - ideal wg , such as fluorescence and higher order spatial modes with complex spectral structure , degrade the result . in addition to this , the expected values have not been achieved due to other experimental imperfections , in particular mechanical instabilities and spatial mode mismatch .",
    "we have studied the ability to tailor the spectral properties of a conventional pp - ktp waveguide .",
    "information about the spectral correlation between signal and idler was retrieved from simple experiments , enabling to model our system with a standard theory of parametric down - conversion .",
    "the viability of this model was tested via the hong - ou - mandel interference between the twin beams .",
    "since the production of more evolved non - gaussian states , as displaced single - photon fock states , requires an overlap between the signal and an independent reference field , we studied the quantum interference between the heralded state and a coherent reference field .",
    "the spectral overlap was directly extracted from the visibility of the hong - ou - mandel interference .",
    "further , we experimentally characterized the statistics of the heralded state .",
    "considering both the spectral overlap and the one - photon contribution , we obtained by a direct detection the fidelity of 78% between the prepared state and a single - photon fock state .",
    "in addition , our observations show that heralding decreases the number of modes only if both signal and idler are spectrally filtered .",
    "although we found that in the current experiment the spectral overlap between the reference and the signal state is not yet optimized , we provide a clear and simple recipe for tailoring the characteristics of the spectral correlation and for testing the degree of decoupling , i.e. , the fidelity of the heralded state .",
