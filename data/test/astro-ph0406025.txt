    "cosmological gamma - ray bursts are one of the most interesting and exotic phenomena in astrophysics . in standard burst models ( e.g. see piran 1999 ; mszros 2001 for reviews ) , the rapidly expanding fireball decelerates , converting the internal energy of the hot plasma into kinetic energy of the beamed , relativistically moving ejecta and electron - positron pairs .",
    "at the point where the fireball becomes optically thin and the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) we see is emitted , the matter will not emit non - thermal gamma - rays unless some mechanism can efficiently re - convert the kinetic energy back into internal energy , i.e. , unless some particle acceleration process takes place .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration is widely believed to be this mechanism ( e.g. , rees & mszros 1992 ; piran 1999 ) for the prompt emission ; it is also likely to be a key element for the underlying physics of x - ray and optical flashes and burst afterglows .",
    "an important question concerning burst models is whether or not their prompt emission can be accurately described by a detailed shock acceleration analysis , and if so , how is the pertinent parameter space of models limited by the observations ?",
    "tavani ( 1996a , b ) proposed a synchrotron shock emission model that invoked such diffusive acceleration as the means for generating non - thermal distributions .",
    "this work has been an interpretative driver in the field , due in part to the impressive model fits of data he obtained .",
    "yet , tavani s model and many subsequent works do not treat the critical involvement the acceleration process has on shaping the relationship between the thermal and non - thermal portions of the electron distribution .",
    "the normal approach is to simplify the distribution to a truncated or broken power - law , occasionally with an additional thermal component .",
    "the viability of the synchrotron model , or emission scenarios that invoke any other radiation mechanism , hinges on such subtleties of the particle distribution , which are inextricably linked to the nature of shock acceleration , diffusive or coherent .",
    "in addition , they must provide compatibility with the hard x - ray spectral index , an issue raised by preece et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 2000 ) , who observed that around 1/3 of all batse bursts exhibited spectra that were too flat below the peak to accommodate a synchrotron interpretation .    this paper explores the general expectations for burst emission spectra from shock acceleration theory .",
    "parametric descriptions for a linear combination of thermal and non - thermal distributions are used to obtain fits to burst spectra for the cases of the synchrotron , inverse compton and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanisms , and these distributions are interpreted in the context of known results from acceleration simulations .",
    "cases of particles cooling much slower than their acceleration are treated in this exposition ; justification for these are discussed in section  [ sec : cooling ] .",
    "the focus is on grbs observed by the compton gamma - ray observatory , specifically those with egret detections that provide broad spectral coverage and therefore more constrained fits around the spectral peak .",
    "it is found that acceptable fits are only possible with a marked dominance of non - thermal electrons , contrasting the particle distributions obtained in acceleration simulations .",
    "this poses a general problem for any burst acceleration paradigm where the non - thermal population is drawn probabilistically from a thermal gas .",
    "in addition , fits are found to be more or less equally acceptable for the synchrotron and inverse compton processes ; it is anticipated that swift will provide a number of bright bursts where spectral fitting down into the x - ray band might enable discrimination between such emission mechanisms . however , at this juncture , spectroscopic discrimination against unabsorbed synchrotron self - compton scenarios seems probable , given that the characteristically broad ssc spectra in space are difficult to reconcile with cgro data . in service of this analysis ,",
    "a compact formalism for ssc emissivities from thermal and truncated power - law electron distributions is present in the appendix .",
    "it is anticipated that glast s broad spectral coverage from kev to gev , supplied by the gamma - ray burst monitor in the batse band and the large area telescope in and above the egret band , will render glast a powerful tool in constraining and interpreting burst spectral properties in the future .",
    "this section explores the relationship of synchrotron spectra to the electron energy and angular distributions , inferring lorentz factor distributions using data from the bright burst grb 910503 as a representative case study .",
    "the formalism for synchrotron radiation in optically thin environs is standard and readily available in many textbooks , including the treatments of bekefi ( 1966 ) , jackson ( 1975 ) and rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "the standard convention for the labelling of the photon polarizations will be adopted , namely that refers to the state with the photon s _ electric _ field vector parallel to the plane containing the magnetic field and the photon s momentum vector , while denotes the photon s electric field vector being normal to this plane .",
    "the classical ( photon ) angle - integrated emissivities for the and polarization for monoenergetic electrons of lorentz factor moving at angle to the field are ( e.g. westfold 1959 ; jackson 1975 ; rybicki and lightman 1979 ) @xmath0 in units of , where the are modified bessel functions of the second kind .",
    "the generally higher probability of emitting photons than ones reflects the intrinsic dipolar radiative nature of accelerating / oscillating charges ; the polarization is elliptical for photon propagation along the field .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron rate factor that scales these emissivities is @xmath1 here , is the fine structure constant .",
    "the photon energies that appear in these functions that form the scaling for the energies of emission are [ with the electron compton wavelength over being ] : @xmath2 where is the particle s larmor radius , and gauss is the quantum critical field .",
    "note that since , the photon angles to the field form a narrow distribution about .",
    "furthermore , the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : synchrate ] ) are appropriate for cases where the particle momenta are not closely aligned with the magnetic field ; situations of such near alignment are discussed in section  [ sec : pitch_synch ] below .",
    "the total synchrotron emissivity is obtained by integrating over the energy and angular distribution of the particles . for electron distributions in units of , summing over polarizations forms the expression for the emissivity that will be used mostly throughout this paper ( in units of ): @xmath3",
    "this is the differential photon spectrum ; frequently in this work , reference will be made to the so - called spectrum , a spectral energy distribution that is proportional to .",
    "physical diagnostics on the grb environment are obtained by comparing the emission spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : synch_emiss ] ) with observations .",
    "the obvious database of choice comprises batse observations from the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) , specifically the batse spectroscopy catalog of preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with its pubicly - accessible electronic compilation .",
    "yet this data possesses a principal limitation , namely that imposed by the restricted energy band of batse .",
    "inferences of particle distributions are generally on a more secure footing when using broader burst spectra , particularly in domains of significant spectra structure , which is the intrinsic nature of the batse pool .",
    "thus , the two decades of energy afforded by batse often are insufficient to describe the nature of the non - thermal particle distribution invoked in models .",
    "data from the egret experiment on cgro suitably augment this situation and extend the dynamic range by 24 orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "accordingly , a focus on egret bursts is insightful and offers more secure determinations of particle distributions .",
    "use is therefore made of spectral compilations of batse , comptel and egret data that are offered in schaefer et al .",
    "specifically , a case study is made here of grb 910503 , observing that the inferences to be made generally extend to the handful of other egret bursts , and also to a large number of bright batse bursts that possess no confirmed egret detections .",
    "note that the focus here is primarily on time - integrated spectra .",
    "given the complexity and diversity of burst time profiles , and associated variations in spectral shape and the well - known hard - to - soft evolution , detailed spectral fits will depend on the time window chosen . a classic example for this",
    "is provided by the gradual emergence of a hard gamma - ray component in the spectrum of grb 941017 ( gonzalez , et al .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper apply to the mean properties of the emitting particle distributions , and are striking enough to indicate their applicability for most or nearly all of the duration of the bursts studied herein .",
    "a variety of particle distributions are possible in modeling burst spectra .",
    "clearly , all should contain a non - thermal component , since the data are clearly non - thermal : purely isothermal models do not work ( pacynski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ) , though constructed convolutions of thermal spectra of different temperatures are possible .",
    "the emphasis here is motivated by physical interpretation , and the leading contender for non - thermal particle energization in bursts is diffusive acceleration at relativistic shocks in the burst outflow .",
    "such acceleration is well studied in non - relativistic flows , and is widely believed to originate with thermal particles that are diffusively transported when interacting with field turbulence in the shock environs .",
    "such transport effects many crossings of the shock layer ( e.g. see drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ; jones & ellison 1991 for reviews ) , that lead to a friction term in the momentum evolution , i.e. acceleration .",
    "while other acceleration models such as reconnection and coherent electrodynamic energization exist and are appropriate in a variety of astrophysical environments ( e.g. the solar corona , pulsar magnetospheres ) , diffusive shock acceleration is the most widely invoked in astrophysical models ; it forms the centerpiece of discussion here as well as for many investigations of bursts .",
    "tavani ( 1996a , b ) proposed a shock emission model that invoked such diffusive acceleration as the means for generating non - thermal distributions .",
    "this work has been an interpretative driver in the field , in no small part due to the impressive model fits of data obtained .",
    "the principal purpose of this section is to delve deeper into the physical implications of such data fitting .",
    "accordingly , it is appropriate to use an electron distribution similar to tavani s ( 1996a , b ) to add insight to the discussion . here , the quasi - isotropic electron distribution @xmath4 is adopted , where is a step function with for and zero otherwise , and is the system or post - shock temperature .",
    "the factor directly relates to the efficiency of acceleration , and is a parameter in the fitting protocol , as are ( assumed much greater then unity ) , the dimensionless , the non - thermal index , and the normalization factor .",
    "the ensuing discussion will provide physical grounds justifying this choice of distribution in shocked environs ; other possibilities with different mandates include the broken power - law adopted by lloyd & petrosian ( 2000 ) .",
    "note that is independent of for true isotropy . in many cases in this paper , will be chosen for simplicity , since this corresponds to the dominant radiative contribution from the synchrotron mechanism .",
    "the parameter is introduced to generalize from tavani s ( 1996a , b ) fits , permitting the non - thermal distribution to emerge perhaps at truly super - thermal energies , rather than exactly in the thermal peak ( tavani s restricted case ) .",
    "typical acceleration spectra in non - relativistic shocks assume forms similar in general appearance to eq .",
    "( [ eq : elec_dist ] ) . specifically , they correspond to the portion of parameter space ( at least for ions ) , so that dissipation in the shock layer leads to a heating plus non - thermal acceleration that ensues only at super - thermal energies in the maxwell - boltzmann tail .",
    "evidence for such a structured distribution can be found both in heliospheric measurements of accelerated ions near shocks ( e.g. earth s bow shock : see ellison , mbius & paschmann 1990 ; interplanetary shocks : see baring et al .",
    "1997 ) , and also a variety of acceleration simulations and theoretical analyses ( e.g. see scholer , trattner & kucharek 1992 ; giacalone et al",
    ". 1993 , baring , ellison & jones 1993 ; ellison , baring & jones 1996 ; kang & jones 1997 ) .",
    "the situation for relativistic shocks is less certain , due in no small part to the absence of _ in situ _",
    "spacecraft determinations of particle spectra ; simulation expectations for such environments are discussed below . in this paper , values of appear ,",
    "being in general only weakly constrained by the fits and largely motivated by the above physical and theoretical considerations .    while numerical evaluations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : synch_emiss ] ) given the electron distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elec_dist ] ) were performed to obtain approximations to burst spectra , standard asymptotic limits are readily attainable in analytic form .",
    "the non - thermal contribution to the synchrotron spectrum ( from the truncated power - law ) , dominant whenever , assumes the following power - law forms ( derived , for example , from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : synchfinal ] ] ) : @xmath5 here , is the component of the field perpendicular to the instantaneous electron motion .",
    "the thermal component , sampled when , necessarily declines exponentially at photon energies well above the thermal peak , but possesses the same power - law dependence as in the non - thermal case for low photon energies : @xmath6 this spectral similarity at low energies follows from the narrow nature of the distributions being convolved with the synchrotron emissivity functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : synchrate ] ) .",
    "accordingly , it is not possible to distinguish between emission from thermal or power - law distributions if spectrum measurements exist only at energies below the peak ; some other diagnostic is required .",
    "the exponential decline above the thermal peak possesses a somewhat complex two - domain structure ; the reader is referred to pavlov & golenetskii ( 1986 ) , brainerd & petrosian ( 1987 ) and baring ( 1988a ) for the presentation of appropriate asymptotic forms in cases .",
    "it must be noted that throughout this paper , photon spectra are generated in the shock rest frame ( srf ) and then boosted in energy to the observer s frame ( of ) by a fixed doppler factor , independent of photon angle in the srf .",
    "this approximation , essentially adopted in many models of grb spectra , is expedient but does not accommodate the fact that photon distributions in the srf are inherently anisotropic due both to the instrinsic nature of the synchrotron and inverse compton processes , and also to the fact that relativistic shocks naturally generate anisotropic ions and electrons . notwithstanding , this boost approximation does not dramatically distort the angle - integrated of spectral shape for typical srf angular distributions and suffices to describe the continuum for the purposes of the discussions here .      before presentation of results",
    ", it is appropriate to address the modeling procedure used in this paper .",
    "approximate spectra , as opposed to data fits , were derived visually using both log - log and semi - log representations of spectra to increase confidence in the results .",
    "least squares trials were performed in some cases , but with no addition of insight or perceived accuracy .",
    "this choice of a visual approach was one of expediency , and did not compromise the scientific conclusions presented here ; the essential points are unambiguously made without the need of statistical analysis .",
    "this latitude is afforded by the limited energy range of the data in the batse catalog : slight adjustments in parameters used to fit the extant data for a given burst would almost certainly have been dominated by those needed to accommodate a broader spectral range . for the specific cases of grb 910503 and grb 910601 , where egret data are incorporated in the study ,",
    "the uncertainty in the mev data points is a major contributor to the determination of model parameters . in bursts where no egret or comptel data were used ,",
    "the `` fit '' was actually to the band ( 1993 ) model spectral fit presented in the preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) spectroscopy catalog , not to the actual data . in such cases ,",
    "the high energy band model index was adopted , and other distribution parameters adjusted . in this sense , there was in implicit second order incorporation of the statistics embodied in the band model fit .",
    "it must be emphasized that there is no uniquely preferred method for statistically fitting public data since it is already a convolution of model and instrumental response . the correct approach ( as in lloyd & petrosian 2000 ) would be to fold spectral models here through the batse or egret detector response function , an enterprise that rapidly becomes more ambitious when different instrumental responses must be blended .",
    "such complexity seems premature for the explorations of this paper , and is deferred until the more refined data of swift and glast becomes available .",
    "results for the spectral approximation of the grb 910503 data are presented in figure  [ fig : synch_spec_dist ] , together with the multi - instrument , time - integrated cgro data as provided by schaefer ( private communication ) prior to the public release in schaefer et al .",
    "we remark that the spectral deconvolutions published in schaefer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were made independently for each data set from the different cgro instruments , applying an artificial normalization to reconcile offsets in the different data amplitudes .",
    "such a procedure is less accurate than a joint spectral deconvolution of the entire spectral data set ( see for example the analysis of grb 990123 data in briggs et al .",
    "notwithstanding , the major conclusions of this paper are robust and are not affected by such subtleties of data analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : synch_spec_dist ] displays both synchrotron emission spectra for the case of pitch angles ( the so - called _ quasi - isotropic _ case ) , and the inferred electron distribution that generates the continuum . for the solid curve approximate case ,",
    "the overall normalization is obviously a free parameter and was offset slightly from the data for visual clarity .",
    "the electron distributions were normalized to unit area in space .",
    "the solid curve depicts the case that would be required to explain the photon spectrum .",
    "the non - thermal particle distribution clearly dominates the thermal component in this `` fit . ''",
    "its index differs from the value of 3.8 that tavani ( 1996a ) obtained in his analysis of this burst , a discrepancy that is actually insignificant given the error bars in the egret data .",
    "adjustment of the parameter to improve the appearance of the model approximation around and above the spectral peak led to the assumed value of , accurate to around 15% .",
    "notwithstanding , there appears to be some spectral structure around the peak that can not be explained by the simple particle distribution in eq .",

    "the parameter describing the relative normalization of the non - thermal and thermal components was found to be ( ) , a strikingly large value that is not addressed explicitly in detail by tavani ( 1996a ) .",
    "a discussion of the implications of an inferred particle distribution with such a large follows just below .",
    "a similar property is obtained for synchrotron model fits for batse bursts grb 940619 ( trigger number 3035_6 ) and grb 940817 ( trigger number 3128_5 ) from the preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) catalog , and also for grb 910601 and grb 910814 whose composite spectra are presented in schaefer et al .",
    "the spectra for bursts grb 930131 and grb 940217 that possess egret detections also suggest a similar result , though the lack of a composite broad - band multi - instrument spectrum for each in the literature precluded a detailed analysis .",
    "the parameter regime of is expected to be pervasive for batse bursts , due to the smoothness of their circumpeak continua . for comparative purposes , another distribution and its resultant synchrotron",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig : synch_spec_dist ] as dashed curves .",
    "the distribution was deliberately chosen to possess a somewhat dominant thermal component , motivated by expectations from shock acceleration theory , and clearly yields a spectrum that grossly deviates from the observations both well above and well below the peak .",
    "while these deductions are obtained using a time - integrated spectrum , such a conclusion must apply either for most of the burst duration , or at sub - intervals when the burst was at its brightest .    for the synchrotron mechanism to be a viable explanation of grb spectra ,",
    "the underlying particle distribution must be physically realistic . here , expectations of particle distributions from shock acceleration theory are the predominant focus , partly because this was the preferred acceleration mechanism in tavani ( 1996a , b ) , and largely because this is the underlying energization assumed in most burst models . in a nutshell ,",
    "both theory and observation pertaining to non - relativistic shocks strongly indicate and cases .",
    "note that is essentially the parameter that demarcates the relative normalization of the non - thermal and thermal components in equation  ( [ eq : elec_dist ] ) .",
    "applications of shock acceleration in the heliosphere and at supernova remnant shells more or less mandate these parameter regimes , since the seed pool of particles that can be subjected to acceleration are thermal and moreover plentiful . in heliospheric environs ,",
    "the source is the cold solar wind , and there is little evidence of significant pre - heating that is not connected to the shock system under study .",
    "the _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements exhibit strong heating at shocks and the generation of dominant thermal ions in the downstream regions , corresponding to cases .",
    "data taken at the high sonic mach number earth s bow shock ( e.g. see ellison , mbius & paschmann 1990 ; scholer , trattner & kucharek 1992 ) and low sonic and afvnic mach number interplanetary shocks ( e.g. see gosling et al . 1981 ; baring et al .",
    "1997 ) clearly support this assertion . in supernova remnants ,",
    "direct particle measurements are , or course , impossible , and inferences can only be made from radiative signatures . while electron temperatures and densities can be estimated from x - ray signals and molecular emission in the ir / optical bands , the data can not yet clearly discriminate and situations .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", diffusive shock acceleration naturally draws particles from the thermal pool via transport in shock - associated turbulence . whether this be first or second order in momentum transport , thermal and non - thermal particles are subjected to similar diffusion , at least as far as ions are concerned , so that circumstances would require virtually complete suppression of thermalization and a 100% efficiency of acceleration out of the thermal pool .",
    "such a scenario would require unusually anomalous spatial diffusion coefficients ( i.e. extremely small ) at thermal momenta , or perhaps strange and non - dissipative electrodynamic properties in the shock layer .",
    "note that is more likely to increase at low energies due to the possibility of wave damping by thermal populations ( e.g. see forman , jokipii & owens 1974 , for the relationship between and wave power spectra within the confines of quasi - linear theory ) . without the assumption of anomalous forms for , monte carlo transport simulations",

    "the `` injection '' of ions from the thermal pool is extremely efficient , but not incredibly so .",
    "hybrid plasma simulations ( e.g. see trattner & scholer 1991 , 1993 ; scholer , trattner & kucharek 1992 ; giacalone et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ; liewer , goldstein & omidi 1993 ) of wave generation and ion transport near non - relativistic shocks , which treat the electron component as a background fluid and therefore address only some of the electrodynamic aspects of the plasma in the shock layer , produce similar distributions .",
    "these indications are strongly suggestive , but not decisive for the gamma - ray burst problem , since they largely do nt focus on electron properties and equally importantly do not explore acceleration at relativistic shocks . in situ measurements of non - thermal electrons at shocks are limited ; examples include recent geotail observations of interplanetary shocks ( shimada , et al .",
    "1999 ; terasawa et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "accordingly , discussion is dependent on simulational information , as is the case for relativistic shocks , and the literature is sparse on such a subject .",
    "monte carlo simulations of ion acceleration at relativistic shocks ( e.g. ellison , jones & reynolds 1990 ; baring 1999 ; ellison & double 2002 ) generate the same injection properties as do non - relativistic shocks , i.e. .",
    "plasma simulations of relativistic shocks are similarly sparsely studied .",
    "gallant et al . ( 1992 ) and hoshino et al . (",
    "1992 ) presented results from one - dimensional ( 1d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of electron - positron and electron - positron - proton plasmas in ultrarelativistic flows with perpendicular shocks , where the mean field was orthogonal to the shock normal .",
    "such simulations treat the full electrodynamics of such plasmas , but are severely limited by cpu constraints .",
    "accordingly , they tend to use unrealistically small proton to electron mass ratios , and model relatively small spatial scales .",
    "these constraints tend to mask the production of some wave modes and limit consideration to particles with energies at most a few to ten times thermal .",
    "the context for these investigations was pulsar wind flows , and they revealed no acceleration in pure plasmas . with the addition of protons in significant abundances , hoshino et al .",
    "( 1992 ) demonstrated that non - thermal positrons ( and not electrons ) could be created , as the ions generated elliptically - polarized magnetosonic modes that resonantly interacted with the positrons .",

    "( 1992 ) for an ultrarelativistic plasma shock of arbitrary field obliquity , and found that electron / positron acceleration arose in quasi - parallel scenarios , but disappeared when the field obliquity to the shock normal increased above around degrees , concurring with zero acceleration in the earlier results for perpendicular shocks . a scaled version of their parallel shock distribution ( binned in energy ) is depicted in fig .  [ fig : synch_spec_dist ] , and is fairly proximate to the , case .",
    "a notable feature of the simulation data is the very limited range of energies accessible to the pic technique , imposed by the severe cpu limitations for such complex codes .",
    "some interesting recent pic simulations results have been presented by shimada & hoshino ( 2000 ) and hoshino & shimada ( 2002 ) for electron - proton plasmas containing mildly - relativistic shocks , where suprathermal power - law electrons are generated and the distribution closely resembles the pic simulation data depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : synch_spec_dist ] . yet , as with the mace and jones results , the complete distribution reveals that the power - law emerges only well into the maxwellian tail , corresponding to the situation elicited in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is noted in passing that the one - dimensional nature of these simulations potentially imposes an important absence of critical physics to the acceleration problem : jokipii , kta & giacalone ( 1993 ) and jones , jokipii and baring ( 1998 ) demonstrate that particle diffusion across field lines is eliminated when simulations restrict the spatial dimensions to less than three .",
    "the implication of this result for the shocks is a cessation of acceleration when thermal particles can not be transported across fields to return to the shock from the downstream side ; baring , ellison & jones ( 1993 ) demonstrated that for high mach number , non - relativistic ion shocks , a quenching of acceleration through this effect would arise at around , a result that matched the behavior seen in the relativistic pic simulations of mace and jones .",
    "moreover this result is consistent with the absence of acceleration in non - relativistic 1d hybrid plasma simulations applied to the quasi - perpendicular heliospheric termination shock ( e.g. liewer , goldstein & omidi 1993 ; kucharek & scholer 1995 ) , a site that is believed to generate the non - thermal anomalous cosmic rays .",
    "the essential loss of physics in simulations of restricted dimensionality is clearly crucial to the correct modeling and interpretation of particle acceleration in gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the principal conclusion of this discussion is that there is little observational or simulational evidence for quasi - isotropic electron distributions in the environs of shocks that would render a synchrotron spectrum commensurate with the grb910503 data in particular and typical burst spectra in general .",

    "this is true even for pathological choices of electron energy distributions : from the form in eq .",

    "note that the mechanism of `` jitter '' radiation in turbulent magnetic fields ( medvedev 2000 ) possesses similar spectral properties due to the intrinsic kinematic coupling , thereby offering an alternative possibility of similar promise .",
    "pitch angle synchrotron might arise when electrons stochastically increase their pitch angle from virtually zero during an acceleration process . for it to provide the major contribution ,",
    "a prevalence of small pitch angles must be strongly favored , i.e. the pitch angles must not be significantly populated , so that normal synchrotron emission does not dominate .",
    "it is not clear how this might come about , though rapid cooling and inefficient diffusion transverse to the field is an interesting possibility ( e.g. see lloyd - ronning and petrosian 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , small pitch angles must be prepared in the first instance , which suggests a coherent electrodynamic mode of acceleration as opposed to diffusive one .",
    "while pas may afford a means of enhancing the non - thermal radiative signal relative to the thermal component , a detailed exploration of pas spectral shapes and polarization for thermal and non - thermal distributions in the context of diffusive acceleration will be the subject of future work .      while detailed exploration of cooling effects is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "a brief discussion is appropriate .",

    "this presents problems for models invoking strong cooling in generating spectra like those seen by cgro .",
    "such models are most applicable to grb environments where the emission regions are somewhat remote from the acceleration ones .",
    "this is because even though synchrotron radiation is a remarkably efficient process , diffusive acceleration at shocks is even more so .",
    "accordingly , coincident acceleration and emission zones of the same physical scale can exhibit prolific acceleration up to some maximum lorentz factor , before radiative cooling in the magnetic field causes cessation of acceleration .",
    "the spectral turnover that marks this cessation is quasi - exponential in nature , and have not been observed in burst spectra to date .",
    "this combination acceleration / radiation scenario is widely envisaged in the contexts of x - ray and gamma - ray emission from supernova remnants and blazars .",
    "whenever multiple spatial or temporal scales are sampled , convolution of spectral contributions can blur the turnover into a broad distribution , essentially the case explored by ghisellini , celotti & lazzati ( 2000 ) .",
    "the rate of acceleration scales as the inverse gyrofrequency , which has a weaker dependence on electron lorentz factor than the synchrotron cooling rate .",
    "specifically , the acceleration timescale ( in seconds ) can be approximated by , where is the energy of the electrons in units of tev , is the shock speed in units of , is the mean magnetic field strength ( measured in gauss ) , and is a factor of order unity that accounts for corrections to the diffusive timescale appropriate for relativistic shocks . the synchrotron cooling timescale ( also in seconds ) is .",
    "various versions of these formulae are widely available , though a specific discussion of them in the context of blazars is in baring ( 2002 ) ; they are effectively applicable in the comoving frame of the burst outflow , as opposed to the observer s frame .",

    "namely that the spectral turnover occurs at around 50 mev , independent of the magnetic field strength .",
    "since significant questions surround the viability of the synchrotron mechanism in explaining burst spectra , consideration of alternative emission processes is warranted . here",
    ", the focus is on inverse compton scattering , another very efficient radiative mechanism . for the purposes of the discussion here",

    "it shall be seen that the resulting predictions for prompt emission spectra for these two cases are manifestly different .",
    "the inverse compton ( ic ) mechanism possesses two obvious advantages over synchrotron radiation : ( i ) high values of can be avoided , since there is no requirement that the synchrotron peak appear in the gamma - ray band , and ( ii ) the low energy index can , in cases to be discerned in sections  [ sec : icformalism ] and  [ sec : alphalow_comp ] , be as flat as . at the same time , inverse compton scenarios ( particularly the ssc case ) have the disadvantage of requiring that synchrotron radiation or other components be unobservable at optical and lower wavebands during the prompt and early afterglow phases .",
    "the parameter constraints thereby imposed are discussed in section  [ sec : constraint ] .    the well - known criterion for ic to dominate synchrotron as an electron cooling mechanism ( i.e. also in total bolometric luminosity for a spatially uniform medium )",

    "note that fluctuations in the jet orientation or structure would lead to the emergent inverse compton spectra being highly variable both in flux ( observed in bursts and therefore not a problem , in principle ) and in spectral shape  any structure such as the peak would be expected to vary in time rapidly in energy due to the scattering kinematics .",
    "while modest fluctuations ( as opposed to hard - to - soft evolution ) are present in gamma - ray burst prompt emission , detailed modeling would be required to discern whether they could match those produced by anisotropic scattering scenarios .",
    "any anisotropy in the soft photon population is not sampled until they become more collimated than the electrons ; only then does the emissivity change appreciably from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ic_emiss ] ) .",
    "then , electrons within the photon `` cone '' of beaming experience an almost full range of incident photon angles in their rest frames , so that they contribute an inverse compton spectrum similar to that for isotropic soft photons .",
    "however , the majority of electrons lie outside this cone , and for these , collisions with photons are predominantly head - on , leading to a depletion of the softer photons from the overall inverse compton spectrum just as with electron collimation . hence",
    ", one expects that such soft photon anisotropies could in principal also flatten the spectrum below the peak .      to provide a meaningful comparison with the preceding mechanisms , grb 910503",
    "is again used as a focal point . yet , so as to provide a variation , here a case study for another egret burst , grb 910601 is also presented .",
    "results for the spectral fitting for synchrotron self - compton scattering are presented in figure  [ fig : ssc_spec_dist ] .",
    "the `` fits '' were performed using the formalism presented in section  [ sec : sscformalism ] , specifically with numerical evaluations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sscfinal ] ) and  ( [ eq : sscfinal_th_too ] ) .",
    "the figure displays the ssc emission spectra for the case of an isotropic electron distribution , for each burst .",
    "the solid curve depicts the case that would most closely explain the photon spectrum , with the overall normalization again being a free parameter . due to the strong dependence of the characteristic energy on electron lorentz factor ,",
    "the values of required to move the ssc peak into the gamma - ray band lead to inferences of sub - gauss fields if .",
    "consider first grb 910503 .",
    "the most obvious features are that the `` fit '' is more difficult than for the emission mechanisms previously considered , with poor results for the lower energies much below the peak , and that the thermal contribution must be dramatically suppressed .",
    "the cause is easily identified : the ssc spectrum is intrinsically much broader than either the ic or synchrotron spectra .",
    "this is due to the characteristic energy for ssc embodied in the dimensionless parameter ( see equation  [ [ eq : chidef ] ] ) scaling as ( or for the thermal case ) .",
    "consequently , small changes in the electron near the peak of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution incur large variations in the ssc photon energy so that the spectral peak is broad .",
    "this effect is manifested in the non - thermal ssc emissivity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sscfinal ] ) , which leads to the excesses evident around 30 kev in the `` fits '' of figure  [ fig : ssc_spec_dist ] , and more profoundly for the thermal ssc contribution , which is extremely broad . from eq .  ( [ eq : sscthlimits ] ) a notable conclusion can be drawn : that the thermal ssc spectrum in the depicted representation only starts to fall above around 30 mev , and then only slowly , i.e. it is blueward of the peak from the non - thermal ssc contribution .",
    "this drives the requisite dramatic suppression of the normalization of a thermal component to the underlying electron distribution , leading to the same issues ( but in this case more strikingly emphasized ) for acceleration from thermal energies that were discussed above .",
    "note that for values of , a comparably satisfactory ssc fit can be obtained with .",
    "observe that for such a large , the tail of the thermal maxwellian emerges above that of the non - thermal distribution for a small range of lorentz factors .",
    "the situation for grb 910601 is even more constrained , due to the markedly steeper gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the thermal electrons must be even less populous to accommodate the comptel and egret data , and the non - thermal electrons must possess a very steep index , considerably steeper than the required for a synchrotron fit .",
    "in fact , both the synchrotron and ic models had much greater success fitting the grb 910601 data , though are not depicted .",
    "steepening the index to produces only marginal improvement in the fit .",
    "the inevitable conclusion of this analysis is that the breadth of the ssc emissivity for even monoenergetic electrons ( derived in equation  ( [ eq : sscfinal_mono ] ) , and closely approximated by the case in figure  [ fig : ssc_spec_dist ] ) is large enough to provide significant or severe problems for the ssc interpretation of prompt emission from gamma - ray bursts .",
    "this contention is not based solely on the grb 910503 and in particular the grb 910601 data ; the similarity of the spectra of grb 910814 ( schaefer et al .",
    "1998 ) and grb 990123 ( briggs et al .",
    "1999 ) to that of grb 910601 strongly suggests that a spectroscopic incompatibility of the ssc mechanism for prompt emission may be commonplace , specifically for differential burst spectra steeper than around above the peak .",
    "bursts such as the superbowl one ( grb 930131 ) with high energy index may be much more compatible with an ssc scenario .",
    "while this assessment may achieve closure in the swift / glast era , a caveat is possibly provided if the synchrotron continuum is strongly self - absorbed .",
    "this is the scenario envisaged by panaitescu & meszaros ( 2000 ) and liang , boettcher & kocevski ( 2003 ) , with the latter group suggesting that ssc with moderate optical depths (  ) could explain x - ray excesses seen in some burst spectra . with such strong absorption ,",
    "the supply of soft photons for inverse compton upscattering is more sharply peaked than even the synchrotron continuum from electrons possessing a truncated power - law distribution , thereby approximately mimicking the pure inverse compton spectral shapes explored in section  [ sec : part_comp ] .",
    "the requirement that self - absorption be effective in narrowing the synchrotron self - compton peak is that the turnover energy exceeds that of the synchrotron peak , which is below the x - ray band . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfabs_energy ] ) , one quickly arrives at the requisite condition : @xmath27 for @xmath28 here is the energy of the peak in the prompt emission . for , one deduces that  , so that optical depths can be tolerated for typical without pushing too low , i.e. into the mildly - relativistic regime .",
    "detailed computations of self - absorbed ssc spectra are deferred to future work .",
    "in addition to the soft gamma - ray spectral shape , a probing diagnostic on the emission mechanisms is whether their extrapolation down to the optical band can be accommodated by optical monitoring data for bursts .",
    "such broadband constraints turn out not to be profoundly limiting for synchrotron or pure inverse compton emission .",
    "however , they do impact ssc models , since these can potentially have a prominent synchrotron component in the optical that might violate upper bounds or , in the case of grb 990123 , prompt optical detections .",
    "it is straightforward to assess how optical band data can constrain ssc model parameters using the formalism derived here .",
    "first , the focus is on observational data .",
    "grb 990123 ( with redshift ) is to date the only burst with a prompt optical detection ( akerlof et al . 1999 ) , peaking at around magnitude 8.8 some 47 seconds after batse trigger and contemporaneous with the batse signal .",
    "these prompt observations were made by the robotic optical transient search experiment - i ( rotse - i ) .",
    "the recent bright burst grb 030329 ( redshift ) was only detected optically by rotse - iii in the afterglow epoch at visual magnitude 12.5 over an hour after the burst trigger on hete-2 ( smith et al .",
    "kehoe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report upper bounds of around magnitude 1315 to half a dozen bursts , in two cases starting just 15 - 20 seconds after trigger .",
    "these low limiting magnitudes can potentially be severely constraining on models with a high optical to gamma - ray flux expectation , though contemporaneous multiwavelength detections are requisite for unambiguous diagnostics .",
    "taking magnitude 9 as a benchmark optical signal for the purposes of exploring broadband constraints , a number that must be considered modulo the source distance and intrinsic luminosity , this corresponds to a differential photon flux of the order of photons sec@xmath29",
    "@xmath30 kev@xmath29 at around 2ev .",
    "this can be compared with the batse spectrum of grb 910503 , a burst brighter than most of those in the sample of kehoe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which has a time - integrated differential flux of photons sec@xmath29 @xmath30 kev@xmath29 at around 100 kev .",
    "the interpolation between such an optical magnitude and gamma - ray flux is a roughly spectrum .",
    "immediately , one infers that synchrotron and inverse compton models for the gamma - rays can accommodate such an optical magnitude ; only limiting magnitudes of around 19 or higher can provide conflicts for these mechanisms .",
    "note that a similar conclusion would apply for pitch angle synchrotron models , which possess very flat low energy asymptotic spectra like inverse compton scenarios .",
    "the situation for ssc broadband spectra is very different .",
    "the ratio of the energy of the ssc peak to that of the synchrotron peak is simply of the order , which would set the synchrotron peak in the infra - red for lorentz factors of , independent of the bulk flow .",
    "lower can move the synchrotron peak into the optical and even the uv .",
    "the ratio of emissivities at the synchrotron and ssc peaks is quickly determined from equations  ( [ eq : ndotsyn_def ] ) and  ( [ eq : ndotsscdef ] ) to be in the notations of this paper , i.e. with .",
    "hence , for , the peaks of the two components would lie roughly on an spectrum .",
    "moreover , opting for to position a synchrotron peak in the optical window , normalizing to the batse spectrum of grb 910503 would yield a count rate an order of magnitude below the magnitude 9 benchmark posited above . at face value",
    ", this would render the ssc scenario compatible with limiting magnitudes of around 11 for this source .",
    "yet comptonization of the spectrum is not evident in the gamma - rays , so it is inferred that , thereby increasing the ratio and lowering the permissible limiting magnitude for a viable ssc model .",
    "accordingly , for the only source with a prompt optical detection , grb 990123 , for the ssc model not to overestimate the observed optical flux , the synchrotron peak has to move somewhat out of the optical , though not much .",
    "this amounts to a modest constraint in phase space that can be quickly deduced , though at this juncture is not particularly enlightening ; such an exercise will be more timely once swift is providing a number of simultaneous hard x - ray and optical detections of bursts .",
    "the interpretative modeling presented here provides a strong indication that the synchrotron and inverse compton processes may provide a more viable explanation of prompt burst spectra than the ssc mechanism .",
    "the spectroscopic bias against ssc is due to its inherently broad character around the peak , and is only marginally constrained by broad - band considerations , i.e. limiting magnitudes in the optical band .",
    "however , strong self - absorption of the synchrotron component can provide an escape clause for ssc scenarios , though this imposes significant fine - tuning of parameter space .",
    "inverse compton provides an attractive possibility for the vast majority of bursts , as does pitch angle synchrotron emission , though quasi - isotropic synchrotron radiation may only be reconciled with around 2/3 of bursts at the lowest energies in the batse window .",
    "discrimination between these processes may prove possible after swift launches and in the glast era , though polarimetric measurements would enhance the diagnostic capability of observations . in analyzing ssc spectral models ,",
    "attractively compact analytic forms for the synchrotron self - compton emissivity from thermal and truncated power - law electron distributions were developed ; these will prove useful for applications of ssc spectral models to a variety of astrophysical environments .",
    "a distinctive conclusion of this work is that agreeable `` fits '' with either synchrotron or inverse compton emission scenarios are only attainable if the underlying electron distribution is profoundly dominated by a non - thermal component .",
    "this result is in contradistinction with standard understanding of acceleration mechanisms such as the diffusive ( fermi ) process at shocks , where the non - thermal particles are drawn probabilistically from the shocked thermal population , and therefore are subdominant in number .",
    "this constraint has profound implications for any proposed grb model , providing a challenge for theorists in an era when computational resources are permitting new avenues for exploration using intensive numerical simulations of particle acceleration at shocks .",

    "<S> the principal paradigm for the generation of the non - thermal particles that are responsible for the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts invokes diffusive shock acceleration at shocks internal to the dynamic ultrarelativistic outflow . </S>",
    "<S> this paper explores expectations for burst emission spectra arising from shock acceleration theory in the limit of particles cooling much slower than their acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> parametric fits to burst spectra obtained by the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) are explored for the cases of the synchrotron , inverse compton and synchrotron self - compton radiation mechanisms , using a linear combination of thermal and non - thermal electron populations . </S>",
    "<S> these fits demand that the preponderance of electrons that are responsible for the prompt emission reside in an intrinsically non - thermal population , strongly contrasting particle distributions obtained from acceleration simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a potential conflict for acceleration scenarios where the non - thermal electrons are drawn directly from a thermal gas , unless radiative efficiencies only become significant at highly superthermal energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the cgro data preclude effective spectroscopic discrimination between the synchrotron and inverse compton mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> this situation may be resolved with future missions probing gamma - ray bursts , namely swift and glast . </S>",
    "<S> however , the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) spectrum is characteristically too broad near the peak to viably account for bursts such as grb 910601 , grb 910814 and grb 990123 . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the ssc mechanism may be generally incompatible with differential burst spectra steeper than around above the peak , unless the synchrotron component is strongly self - absorbed . </S>"
