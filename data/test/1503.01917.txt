    "over the last few decades , two - dimensional ( 2d ) frustrated heisenberg models have become subject of intense research studies owing to an exceptional diversity in a low - temperature magnetic behavior they display @xcite . however , the rigorous treatment of 2d frustrated heisenberg models is mostly unattainable due to extraordinary difficulties , which bear a close relation to non - commutative ( quantum ) character of spin operators .",
    "many semi - classical 2d ising spin systems with competing interactions may also exhibit intriguing cooperative phenomena originating from a geometric spin frustration , but their experimental realizations are regrettably scarce @xcite at the expense of exact solvability of the respective models @xcite . generally , the spin frustration is indispensable ground for emergence of several remarkable cooperative phenomena such as the _ order - by - disorder _ , which refers to a selection of unusual ordered state of some highly frustrated classical or quantum spin model driven either by thermal or quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "another striking phenomenon closely related to the geometric spin frustration is a reentrance , which occurs if an increase in temperature causes a phase transition from a disordered state emerging at lower temperatures to a spontaneously ordered state emerging at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "the reentrant phase transitions have been experimentally detected in various magnetic systems including spin glasses @xcite or even non - magnetic systems such as liquid mixtures @xcite .",
    "exactly solved models belong to the most attracting issues of statistical mechanics , because they provide results not affected by any approximation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the exact solution of the ising model on the bethe lattice can alternatively be viewed as the rather reliable ( bethe - peierls ) approximation of this model on a regular planar lattice with the same coordination number @xcite . however",
    ", the ising model on the bethe lattice can not capture consequences of a geometric spin frustration inherent to the antiferromagnetic ising model on close - packed planar lattices , because the bethe lattices do not contain any ( odd - numbered ) cycles .",
    "this deficiency can be avoided by considering the ising model on another type of recursive lattice built up from the inter - connected polygons , whereas the interior part deep inside of such recursively built tree is usually referred to as the husimi lattice @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to notice that the ising and ising - like models defined on the husimi lattices have played an important role in a description of several interesting physical systems and phenomena like binary alloys , rare gases , lipid bilayers , spin liquids , spin glasses or polymers ( see ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "recently , the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on triangulated ( triangles - in - triangles ) planar lattices have attracted a great deal of attention @xcite , because it closely resembles a magnetic structure of real polymeric coordination compounds cu@xmath0x@xmath1(cpa)@xmath2@xmath3nh@xmath1o ( x = f , cl , br ) with the geometry of triangulated kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "besides a clear experimental motivation , the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on triangulated planar lattices has afforded a valuable playground for an investigation of the role of local quantum fluctuations within a novel class of exactly solvable classical - quantum spin systems .",
    "it has been convincingly evidenced @xcite that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with a greater connectivity of triangles - in - triangles units in the underlying triangular lattice gives rise to stronger local quantum fluctuations , which preferably support a remarkable quantum order at low enough temperatures instead of a quantum disorder through the order - by - disorder effect .",

    "it can be understood from tab .",
    "[ tab ] that the quantum reduction of both sublattice magnetizations gradually shrinks as the coordination number @xmath14 of the triangulated husimi lattice increases .",
    "the quantum reduction of the spontaneous magnetization of the ising spins completely disappears in the limit @xmath113 in contrast to the spontaneous magnetization of the heisenberg spins , which tends towards one - third of its saturation value in the limit @xmath113 .",
    "finally , the notable temperature - induced increase in both sublattice magnetizations can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) for @xmath114 , which bears a close relation to a thermal excitation from the ground - state manifold ( [ odp ] ) to the classical ferromagnetic phase ( [ cfp ] ) accompanied with an increase in the relevant magnetizations ( see the curves for @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) .",
    "the present work deals with the exact solution of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangulated husimi lattices , which has been obtained by the generalized star - triangle mapping transformation and the method of exact recursion relations . in particular",
    ", our attention has been focused on a rigorous determination of the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , which were subsequently corroborated by temperature dependences of the sublattice magnetizations of ising and heisenberg spins serving as the relevant order parameters .",
    "it has been convincingly evidenced that the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model defined on two closely related triangulated husimi lattices may display fundamentally different magnetic behavior even if both lattices may differ from each other just in a connectivity of the same structural triangles - in - triangles unit .",
    "we have furnished rigorous proof that the quantum disorder develops in a highly frustrated region of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangulated husimi lattices with the coordination number @xmath81 and @xmath87 , while the identical model on the triangulated husimi lattices with greater coordination numbers @xmath88 exhibits the spectacular quantum order due to the order - by - disorder effect .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the spontaneous magnetizations of the ising and heisenberg spins undergo a quantum reduction in the remarkable quantum ordered state , which gradually shrinks with increasing a connectivity of the triangles - in - triangles units .",
    "it should be also mentioned that reentrant phase transitions can only be found in the model defined on the triangulated husimi lattice with the coordination number @xmath4 .",
    "to conclude , the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangulated husimi lattices represents a novel exactly solved classical - quantum spin model , which has proved its usefulness in elucidating a sought connection between the quantum order - by - disorder effect and the relative strength of local quantum fluctuations varied systematically through the coordination number of the underlying husimi lattice .",
