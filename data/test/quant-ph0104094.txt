    "angular momentum is a very important concept in dynamics of particles and within quantum mechanics its properties are very well understood @xcite .",
    "one example where the theory has direct application is the rigid rotor model , which is basic for understanding rotational spectroscopy and collisions of molecules .",
    "these processes are described by quantum dynamics , but there are circumstances when classical dynamics is used as alternative .",
    "for example , rotational cross sections for two colliding molecules in principle can be calculated from quantum mechanics , but often it is a challenging task .",
    "classical mechanics , on the other hand , is relatively simple to use , but there several problems in its implementation , say to calculate atom - molecule collision cross sections .",
    "the basic one is how the initial conditions are selected and the final results analyzed .",
    "for example , if one says that a molecule is in the rotational state with the quantum numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 then the question is what to choose for the initial orientation and angular velocity which adequately represents it ?",
    "analogous problem had been analyzed for collisions involving only vibrational energy exchange in atom - molecule collisions , where it was shown how to select initial conditions that adequately represent a particular vibrational state of the molecule .",
    "a recipe was suggested from which transition probabilities were successfully calculated @xcite from classical mechanics , and by that it is meant that initial conditions were selected from a prescribed phase space density but dynamics is calculated from classical equations of motion .",
    "the problem is therefore how does one chooses a set of initial positions and velocities for a particle so that on average its angular momentum has given @xmath2 and @xmath3 values ?",
    "in other words , what is needed is a function @xmath4 with a property that the following averages are obtained @xmath5 in classical mechanics the function @xmath6 is interpreted as a statistical weight from which the position and momentum are selected .",
    "it should be noted that it is not necessary that @xmath7 is positive function , as long as those averages are obtained . in practice",
    "this means that initial conditions are randomly selected from @xmath8 and if @xmath9 sets are chosen then the averages are approximately @xmath10 } { \\sum_{j=1}^{n}sign\\left [ f_{l , m}(\\vec{r}_{j},\\vec{p}% _ { j})\\right ] } \\ ] ] and similarly for the angular momentum . the  function @xmath11 $ ] is the sign of @xmath12 for the set of initial conditions @xmath13 . however , much more stringent condition is that the function @xmath7  is stationary .",
    "the meaning of this can demonstrated on simple example .",
    "if the particle of mass @xmath14 is free and the set of its initial conditions is @xmath13 then its position after time @xmath15 is @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 . from these values",
    "one would be able to calculate a new distribution function @xmath18 , by requiring to have properties as previously described for the function @xmath6 .",
    "stationarity requires that the two functions are identical for any time @xmath15 .",
    "this restriction is very important , for obvious reasons , and it is sufficient to dismiss a large number of ad - hoc distributions .    the most obvious starting point would be the wave function for a particle in a particular angular momentum state , which in the coordinate space is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is spherical harmonic . likewise in momentum space",
    "the wave function is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are angles of the momentum .",
    "one could then form the function @xmath24 from which initial position vector and momentum could be selected , except that neither the averages ( [ claver ] ) are obtained nor the condition of stationarity for the function @xmath6 is satisfied , which is easily proven . therefore this simple idea fails , and",
    "this is because one basic difference between classical and quantum dynamics was not taken into account : classical dynamics is defined in the phase space , while quantum dynamics is either in the coordinate or momentum space .",
    "simple product that was suggested for the distribution @xmath6 only reflects this : it says that initial conditions in the phase space are determined as the product of the distribution from the coordinate _ and _ momentum space , as being independent . what is needed is formulation of quantum mechanics in the phase space , and then one would possibly be able to satisfy those two conditions .",
    "the earliest attempt in this direction was done by wigner@xcite who looked for a function @xmath25 with the property @xmath26 and obtained , what is known as , the wigner function @xmath27 which is regarded as extension of quantum mechanics into the phase space . by defining it in this way",
    "inevitably results in non uniqueness of the extension @xcite , because there are a large class of phase space functions that are defined by the requirements ( [ pq ] ) .",
    "another attempt to formulate quantum mechanics in the phase space is due to moyal@xcite whose main objective was to give it a sound statistical foundation .",
    "the main starting point is postulating observables as operators , and postulating that to each set of commutating observables there is a set of non commuting .",
    "together they form a complete set of observables . for these observable ( operators ) one forms a function from which the characteristic function of statistical theory for a given quantum state @xmath28 is obtained as a matrix element . by the fourier",
    "transform moyal obtains distribution which specifies to the wigner function if the observables are coordinates and momenta .",
    "common to both approaches is that the principles of quantum mechanics are assumed , although moyal analysis is more general .",
    "can the wigner function be used for the distribution @xmath4 ?",
    "it is not clear that the averages ( [ claver ] ) are obtained , in fact as it will be shown later they are only partly obtained .",
    "furthermore , it is also not clear that the stationarity condition is satisfied , however , the wigner function is stationary under the quantum time evolution for the stationary wave function , which is @xmath29 . wigner function was used in various applications and its properties investigated@xcite , but its true significance is when connection with classical dynamics is sought .",
    "it is achieved by the standard assumption that classical dynamics is the limit of quantum when @xmath30 .",
    "it can be shown in general ( one dimensional problem is discussed for the moment ) that the wigner function satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 and in this limit the inhomogeneous term vanishes .",
    "it also vanishes if the potential is quadratic , irrespective of this limit .",
    "the homogeneous equation is the liouville equation , which determines time evolution of the phase space density @xmath25 , and it is solved by classical equations of motion .    despite this , what appears , very important connection between quantum and classical dynamics , there are at least two remarks that one can make about this approach .",
    "it is desirable from understanding quantum - classical connection to learn more about foundations of quantum principles because with classical we are quite familiar . strictly speaking that goal",
    "was not achieved because wether the wigner or moyal formulation of the phase space nothing can be learned about quantum principles because they are the starting point anyway .",
    "the second remark concerns the limit of the phase space density when @xmath30 , which should also be taken and not only the limit for the inhomogeneous term . for the stationary states it can be shown that@xcite @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a fixed energy .",
    "this form greatly restricts possible phase space densities from among those stationary solutions that are obtained from the liouville equation .",
    "however , it is consistent with the accepted view which is based on the correspondence principle : quantum goes over to classical solution for large quantum numbers ( the proof of this is straightforward but not elaborated ) .",
    "classical - quantum connection can be solved by starting from entirely classical principles@xcite , and as it will be shown allows much greater flexibility in application of classical dynamics to quantum problems .",
    "one starts from the liouville equation in classical dynamics , and the argument on which one basis its use is quite straightforward : initial conditions for a particle are never accurately determined , in which case its precise trajectory has no meaning , only probabilities where it is found in the course of time . for example , to claim that position of earth is accurately determined is nonsense , and therefore prediction of its position accurately in the next , say , million years is not possible , especially if perturbation from other planets is taken into account .",
    "however , it is possible to predict probability of finding it at certain position after ( almost ) any length of time .",
    "therefore one starts by formulating classical mechanics as a statistical theory ( it should be strongly emphasized that _",
    "statistical _ does not imply _ many _ particles but probability for a single particle ) , in contrast to the attempt by moyal whose principal aim was to formulate quantum mechanics as a statistical theory .",
    "in other words , one particle in the phase space is not a point but an extended density , which takes into account all uncertainties in determining its whereabouts . for a particle of mass @xmath3",
    "this equation is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the force on the particle and @xmath37 is its momentum .",
    "the index of the operator nabla designates the variable with respect to which the derivatives are taken . for a particular case when phase space density is stationary , which means that @xmath38 ,",
    "the solution is a function of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is arbitrary function and @xmath41 are dynamic invariants of the classical equations of motion .",
    "one of them is hamiltonian for the particle , and another are components of the angular momentum if the force @xmath36 is centrally symmetric .",
    "there are other invariants but they will be mentioned later .",
    "these phase space densities , like any other solution of the liouville equation , lack a very important ingredient in order to be regarded also quantum solutions .",
    "this ingredient is restriction on the possible phase space densities , and it is in the form of the uncertainty principle @xmath42 for any cartesian coordinate . the standard deviations @xmath43 and @xmath44 are calculated from the phase space density .",
    "mathematically speaking , selecting phase space densities according to this restriction is a very well defined problem and it is solved within the fourier analysis .",
    "they are obtained in the form of the convolution @xmath45 which is also recognized as the wigner function .",
    "the function @xmath40 is arbitrary , but if the phase space density satisfies the liouville equation then it satisfies the equation@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and for potential it is not required to be harmonic ( for a general potential parametrization of the phase space density is more elaborate ) .",
    "the common point between the wigner and moyal approach and the one that starts from classical principles is the function ( [ wign ] ) or ( [ roqv ] ) , however it is almost arbitrary ( because there is no reason to choose it from many other functions ) function in the former case but it is convolution in the latter .",
    "apart from that common point there are fundamental differences between the two approaches , the former starts from quantum principles and the latter from classical .",
    "one manifestation of that is attitude towards the uncertainty relationship , which in the former case it is not considered a principle because it is derived from the other ones , while in the latter case it is assumed to be a fundamental principle from which the basic dynamics equation of quantum mechanics ( [ schr ] ) is derived .",
    "one could cite other fundamental differences between the two approaches , but one is that of simplicity . in the wigner - moyal approach one needs all postulates as in formulation of quantum mechanics , about whose number there is no general consensus , but in the approach from classical mechanics one needs only the postulates that defines it ( i.e. there is no need for postulates other than the ones that one is already familiar width ) and the uncertainty postulate .",
    "one could question the meaning of the uncertainty principle , but one could equally question the meaning of the observable - operator , or wave - particle dualism postulates in the formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "other advantages that one has by starting from the classical principles and not from the quantum phase space formulation of wigner and moyal , will be explicitly manifested in the following sections . in particular",
    "it is not clear how to derive the phase space density for the true rigid rotor , which is done in this work , by other than starting from the classical principles .",
    "there is one conceptual problem in the attempt to merge classical dynamics with the uncertainty principle . without",
    "the latter solutions of the liouville equation are the phase space probability densities , and as such they always have positive value .",
    "as soon as one imposes restriction in the form of the uncertainty principle this feature is lost and one often ends with the phase space density that has positive and negative values .",
    "this is the price it is paid by imposing that restriction , and its physics is justified on the grounds that the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to measure precisely the phase space probability density .",
    "one talks then about the phase space density , whose properties are exactly the same as for the probability density .",
    "however , all measurable quantities , e.g. probability density for the coordinates only , must have physically acceptable value .    in the equation ( [ schr ] )",
    "one recognizes schroedinger equation , the basic equation of quantum mechanics .",
    "therefore the described steps in classical mechanics produce identical results as quantum mechanics , provided the initial condition for the phase space density is calculated from the parameterization ( [ roqv ] ) . from these principles angular momentum for the three dimensional harmonic oscillator will be analyzed first .",
    "stationary phase space densities for a three dimensional harmonic oscillator will be analyzed if it is assumed that the average @xmath48 has a given value .",
    "the starting point is the phase space density which is parametrized as ( [ roqv ] ) , where the functions @xmath49 are chosen in the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are spherical angles and @xmath53 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are integers ( in further analysis the units are set in which @xmath56 and the frequency of the oscillator is @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is spherical harmonic and @xmath59 where @xmath9 is normalization constant and @xmath60 is hypergeometric function .",
    "the phase space density is now @xmath61 which in general does not have simple explicit form , but it has few nice features .",
    "it is stationary , which means that its form does not changes with respect to the classical time evolution .",
    "in other words , if classical solution for the trajectory is @xmath62 then @xmath63 = \\rho _ { n , l,\\mu } ( \\vec{% r},\\vec{p})\\;\\ ] ] this means that the phase space density is a function of the dynamic invariants of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "one set of these are elements of the energy tensor ( @xmath64 is omitted for simplicity ) @xmath65 ( the indices designate the cartesian components @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) , and the other are the components of the angular momentum @xmath68 .",
    "of course , any other combination of these basic invariants is possible , e.g. the total angular momentum squared . which ones are present in the phase space density ( [ rohar ] ) are determined by explicit calculation , and the first few for the ground vibrational ( n=0 ) state are given in table i. the symbols represent the following quantities : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these are dynamic invariants for the harmonic oscillator , and therefore the phase space density is indeed stationary .    from the phase space densities",
    "one can calculate the total angular momentum ( [ lclass ] ) and its squared modulus from @xmath71 their values are given in table i and as expected angular momentum is the same as from quantum analysis : it has only the z component and its value is @xmath72 .",
    "however , the angular momentum squared is not equal to @xmath73 , as expected from the quantum treatment , but differs by @xmath74 .",
    "the same is true for other than @xmath75 states , as shown in table ii .",
    "in fact the most surprising finding is that the states with @xmath76 , which are normally associated with the zero angular momentum , have the value @xmath74 for the angular momentum squared .",
    "the question is where this discrepancy comes from ?",
    "the simplest answer is that classical analysis is not correct , because it surely must violate certain rules that are not consistent with the quantum mechanical ones .",
    "however , this answer is not correct , because if one writes the momentum squared as @xmath77 , where the components of the momentum are given with respect to the vector @xmath78 , then its average for the function @xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 after a straightforward , but lengthy , calculation of the integrals one obtains @xmath82 \\psi ( \\vec{r})\\ ] ] which is the correct answer for the kinetic energy operator ( up to a pre - factor , which was not taken into account ) . in the standard interpretation the angular part is then associated with the angular momentum squared operator , which indeed gives zero for angular momentum squared for the @xmath76 states .",
    "therefore the procedure of deriving the kinetic energy operator is correct , but then the question is where the analysis that produced results in tables i and ii is inconsistent with the quantum interpretation ? to answer this question one explicitly calculates the average of @xmath83 , which is the classical angular part of the momentum squared . for simplicity its average",
    "will be calculated for @xmath76 state .    by definition @xmath84 where integration in @xmath85 and @xmath86 is calculated first ,",
    "then @xmath87 and @xmath88 are replaced by derivatives in the variables @xmath89 and @xmath90 that act on the exponential function , respectively , and after partial integration in the same variables one obtains @xmath91\\ ] ] after integration in the variables @xmath92and @xmath93 the only non zero contribution is @xmath94 and it is not zero .",
    "in fact the average of the angular momentum squared ( which is @xmath95 ) is @xmath96 which is precisely the value in tables i and ii .",
    "furthermore the result is independent of the radial function , which indicates that this is a universal number . in order to check the correctness of the result one",
    "calculates the average of the radial part of the momentum squared , and the result is @xmath97\\ ] ] together with the angular part one obtains the radial part of the kinetic energy operator @xmath98 which is the correct answer .",
    "therefore , there is no discrepancy between quantum expression for the kinetic energy and classical treatment in this work , but the difference is in the interpretation of its fragments . according to results in this work one should interpret the radial kinetic energy operator as @xmath99 while @xmath100\\ ] ] is operator for the angular momentum squared .",
    "further confirmation of this comes from calculating the average angular momentum explicitly . for @xmath76 states it is given by @xmath101 which is easily shown to be zero .",
    "this is no contradiction with the previous finding , because zero of the angular momentum is result of cancellations of the contributions from two signs of @xmath93 rather than the modulus of the angular momentum being zero .",
    "one can therefore calculate angular momentum by averaging over only one sign of @xmath93 , because the average over the other gives the same result but with the opposite sign , and the sum - total is zero .",
    "this average is @xmath102 and after evaluating most of integrals one gets @xmath103 by using the relationship @xmath104 where",
    "  designates the principal value of the integral , it is obtained @xmath105\\ ] ] the principal value can be omitted because the integrand is not singular , in which case @xmath106 the value of the z component of the angular momentum , which gets contribution from the space @xmath107 , is independent of the radial function @xmath108 , the same result as before .",
    "rigid rotor in classical physics is a very well defined object , but one could argue that it is also in quantum . unfortunately ,",
    "as it will be shown , the two definitions have not the same meaning .",
    "intuition , which is essentially classical , defines rigid object as the one which does not have breathing ( radial ) motion .",
    "objects that appear to qualify as the rigid are diatomic molecules ( at least many of them ) , which is supported by the approximations in their quantum description .",
    "schroedinger equation for the nuclear motion in the diatomic molecule is @xmath109 + v(r)\\;\\psi\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the reduced mass of the diatomic molecule and @xmath110 is the internuclear potential .",
    "typically this potential has a deep minimum displaced from the origin by the distance @xmath111 ( the bond length ) , which for the modelling purpose is approximated by @xmath112 .",
    "ground state wave function in this potential has the width @xmath113 , and its relationship to the bond length is @xmath114 . under this circumstance",
    "the radial coordinate in the angular part of the kinetic energy operator is approximated by the fixed value @xmath111 , in which case the wave function factors as @xmath115 , where @xmath34 is the ground state energy of the molecule .",
    "the angular function then satisfies the equation @xmath116 where @xmath117\\ ] ] and @xmath118 represents interaction of the molecule that depends on the angles only ( say a dipole in the electric field ) .",
    "the unique feature of the equation ( [ roteq ] ) is that it depends only on the angle variables , orientations angles of the molecule , and in this sense it is called the equation for the rigid rotor .",
    "the operator @xmath119 then represents the kinetic energy operator for the rigid rotor , which has discrete spectrum @xmath120 where @xmath121 are spherical harmonics , the eigenfunctions of the rigid rotor .",
    "however , this is far from being true , if one has the image of the classical rigid rotor in mind .",
    "although in the previous derivation dynamics in the angle variables is de - coupled from the dynamics in the radial this is not sufficient to call the molecule a rigid rotor .",
    "it is also necessary to prove that the radial component of the momentum for the relative motion of the two atoms is de - coupled from its angular ones , and to show this one needs to calculate the momentum space wave function .",
    "this function for a stationary rotational state of the  rigid rotor  is @xmath122 where the expansion of the plane wave in the spherical coordinates was used . de - coupling of the radial component @xmath85 from its angular ones @xmath123 and @xmath93 is therefore not possible because @xmath124 , while the spherical angles @xmath125 and @xmath23 are related to the same components in a complicated way .",
    "therefore it can not be assumed that the theoretical model that was just described represents rigid rotor .",
    "analysis in the phase space is more revealing , but it is somewhat approximate .",
    "it was mentioned that around @xmath126 the potential is very well approximated by harmonic , in which case the entire wave function for the diatomic molecule is @xmath127 where @xmath128 coefficient was assumed to be constant .",
    "the phase space density is then @xmath129 where the angles @xmath130 and @xmath131 are defined in ( [ rthph ] ) .",
    "the rigid rotor model assumption implies that @xmath132 , and if spherical coordinates are used for the vector @xmath133 @xmath134 then the exponent of the harmonic oscillator function is approximately    @xmath135 where in the expansion coefficients , except in the leading one , it was set @xmath136 . by recalling that this expansion is in the exponent it follows that the range of @xmath137 within which it significantly contributes to the phase space density is of the order @xmath113",
    ", however , the range of @xmath138 is of the order @xmath139 .",
    "this means that @xmath140 in which case the phase space density is approximately @xmath141 where the angular function @xmath142 is shorthand for the product of two functions @xmath143 .",
    "dependence of the angular function on the radial variable @xmath86 is also neglected , in which case the phase space density parametrizes as a product of the function for the radial variables and the function for the angular .",
    "the angular phase space density is now defined as @xmath144 and appears to describe the rigid rotor because it is independent of the radial variables . however , this conclusion is false because the phase space density depends on the radial parameter @xmath113 , and in this respect it depends on the radial dynamics . because of this feature",
    "the rigid rotor will be called ",
    "soft  .",
    "average of the angular momentum squared has now the value @xmath145 where the constant term @xmath74 that was obtained in the previous section is missing .",
    "this is expected because coupling with the radial motion was neglected .",
    "another property of the angular phase space density is @xmath146 which shows that it correctly describes the essentials of the angular momentum .",
    "its explicit form for @xmath147 is given by @xmath148 which does not have explicit analytic expression , but its shape is simple , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "for the rotational state @xmath149 and @xmath150 the angular phase space density is @xmath151 where @xmath152 , and in the last step only the terms up to the order @xmath153 where retained . similarly the phase space density for @xmath149 and @xmath154 is @xmath155    these phase space densities , except @xmath156 , are time dependent , which means that they are not functions of only the dynamic invariants of the rigid rotor , e.g. @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "thus for example the terms in @xmath159 that can not be represented by invariants are @xmath160 explicit time dependence of the phase space density is obtained from the time dependence of the angle @xmath51 @xmath161 where @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are initial values of these variables . in the phase space density @xmath165 is replaced by @xmath166 and the time dependence of the probability density ( [ sphhar ] ) is calculated from @xmath167 the first part is time independent , while the second goes to zero after the time interval @xmath168 , which is typically of the order @xmath169 for diatomic molecules .",
    "therefore the probability density starts as ( [ sphhar ] ) but its limiting value is constant , but not in the form of the squared modulus of the spherical harmonic .",
    "previous discussion revealed great difficulty in formulating the concept of the rigid rotor in quantum theory .",
    "this was manifested as inability to formulate the phase space density that involves only the parameters for the rotational degrees of freedom . it does not help to take the limit @xmath170 in ( [ 3dphas ] ) because that would imply infinite dispersion of the variables @xmath171 and @xmath93 , which only reflects the fact that the radial and the angular components of the momentum are interrelated .",
    "there is , however , a way of formulating the true rigid rotor , but should be done by following formulation of quantum mechanics as suggested in introduction .",
    "one starts from the liouville equation in the spherical coordinates , which for a free particle is    @xmath172    and the rigid rotor assumption implies that the phase space density is @xmath173 and @xmath85 independent .",
    "this means that the liouville equation for the rigid rotor is @xmath174 where @xmath173 is constant .",
    "it can be easily verified that if the phase space density is a function of the form @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is arbitrary function , then it is time independent .",
    "additional requirement is that the phase space density should be in accordance with the uncertainty principle , which is achieved by straightforward generalization of the rule that was used before .",
    "the phase space density is therefore parametrized as @xmath177 where the angular functions will be determined for a particular case when the solutions of the liouville equation ( [ rotli ] ) are stationary , i.e. @xmath178 . the relevant variables were defined in ( [ rthph ] ) .",
    "parametrization ( [ rorig ] ) is replaced in the liouville equation ( [ rotli ] ) , and by using transformations of the kind @xmath179 \\\\ p_{\\theta } \\partial _ { p_{\\theta } } \\rho ( \\theta , \\phi , p_{\\theta } , p_{\\phi } ) & = & -\\int d^{2}q\\,e^{2i\\left ( p_{\\theta } q_{\\theta } + p_{\\phi } q_{\\phi } \\right ) } \\partial _ { q_{\\theta } } \\left [ q_{\\theta } \\;\\theta ( \\theta _ { -},\\phi _ { -})\\;\\theta ^{\\ast } ( \\theta _ { + } , \\phi _ { + } ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one obtains , after lengthy simplifications , that the stationary solutions of the liouville equation ( [ rotli ] ) satisfy @xmath180 where @xmath181 -\\,\\theta \\;% \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta _ { + } } \\partial _ { \\theta _ { + } } \\left ( \\sin \\theta _ { + } \\;\\partial _ { \\theta _ { + } } \\theta ^{\\ast } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{\\sin ^{2}\\theta _ { + } } \\partial _ { \\phi + } ^{2}\\theta ^{\\ast } \\right ] \\;\\ ] ] and @xmath182 where @xmath183 .",
    "it is implied that @xmath184 is a function of the variables @xmath185 and @xmath186 while @xmath187 is a function of @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "if the function @xmath190 is neglected for the moment then the condition ( [ stat ] ) implies that the angular function satisfies the differential equation @xmath191 where @xmath192 is a real constant . in this equation one recognizes the equation for the spherical harmonics , where @xmath193 .",
    "however , the function @xmath190 can not be neglected , and therefore the angular functions are only approximately the spherical harmonics . however",
    ", a very useful feature of the function @xmath190 is that in the limits @xmath194 and @xmath195 it is equal to zero , in which case the angular functions are exactly the spherical harmonics .",
    "this means that when the phase space density is integrated over the momentum variables the resulting probability density should be the squared modulus of the spherical harmonics , i.e. @xmath196 the choice of the spherical harmonics for the angular functions is that the phase space density is approximate , which is manifested as being time dependent , i.e. it is not a function of only the dynamic invariants of the rigid rotor .",
    "this is the price that is paid by neglecting the function @xmath197 in the equation ( [ stat ] ) .",
    "inclusion of this function results in the phase space density that is a function of only these invariants , and this fact is used as the procedure to find a proper phase space density .",
    "this is best demonstrated on one example .",
    "one particular case , however , has exact solution , and this is when the angular function is constant . in this case @xmath198",
    "the example that will be analyzed in more details is when the angular function is the spherical harmonic @xmath199 .",
    "the phase space density ( [ rorig ] ) is @xmath200 and its explicit form is ( the constant @xmath201is fixed to unity ) @xmath202 where @xmath203 is modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "this phase space density is not stationary , because the term @xmath204 is not a combination of the dynamic invariants .",
    "however , if @xmath93 is replaced by @xmath205 then @xmath206 which means that these two terms in the phase space density can be omitted without in any way modifying the integral ( [ vjer ] ) , the value of the total angular momentum squared @xmath207 and the angular momentum ( its z - th component ) @xmath208 therefore @xmath209 is time independent and represents phase space density for the rigid rotor in the state with the angular momentum squared @xmath210 and angular momentum @xmath211 , while the probability density ( [ vjer ] ) is @xmath212 .",
    "similarly the phase space density for @xmath149 and @xmath154 is @xmath213 with the property that @xmath214 , @xmath210 and @xmath215 .",
    "the phase space densities for the angular momentum states @xmath216 were calculated as additional example .",
    "they are associated with the angular momentum squared value @xmath217 and the angular momentum @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "they are @xmath219    in this way phase space for the true rigid rotor was defined .",
    "it is  true  because only the variables that are relevant for such object were introduced .",
    "analysis of angular momentum in the phase space was made , and in this context rigid rotor was discussed .",
    "perhaps one of the most intriguing finding is interpretation for the partition of the kinetic energy operator , which is in considerable disagreement with the standard one .",
    "part of what is considered to be radial kinetic energy is in fact contribution from the angular momentum operator , despite the fact that it only contains radial variable .",
    "this finding does not come as a surprise if one makes the following observation in the traditional classical mechanics . given spherically symmetric probability distribution of",
    "coordinates @xmath220 and momenta @xmath221 for a free particle ( say it was obtained my measuring its position and momentum ) the average kinetic energy is not zero despite the fact that the momentum is .",
    "likewise , the average angular momentum is zero but the average modulus squared of it is not because @xmath222 introducing the uncertainty principle does not changes this fact , except that instead of this average having arbitrary value it has a fixed and equal to @xmath74 .",
    "therefore a particle has always non zero modulus of angular momentum , and its minimal value is fixed and independent of the phase space density .",
    "it is like saying that particle always carries a minimal intrinsic angular momentum , but in the way it is described it never manifests itself . for all practical purpose this finding is immaterial , because standard interpretation is self sufficient , but it becomes evident when classical modelling is attempted .    from the phase space density for the rigid rotor one",
    "expects to obtain momentum space probability density , which is given by @xmath223 however one should be careful about components of the momentum variable . throughout the paper",
    "the components with respect to the vector @xmath224 were used , because they are natural when angular momentum is analyzed .",
    "this is because @xmath171 and @xmath93 are components along the appropriate angular unit vectors that are perpendicular to the vector @xmath225 and hence directly proportional to the angular momentum ( they can be called radius vector components of the momentum ) .",
    "however , in the momentum space one works only with the components of the momentum vector , which for the mentioned components this is not the case . if @xmath226 is modulus of the vector @xmath37 while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are its spherical angles then @xmath227 \\sin \\theta \\;\\sin \\theta _ { p}\\right )   \\label{pcomp } \\\\",
    "p_{\\theta } & = & p\\left ( \\sin \\theta \\;\\cos \\theta _ { p}-\\cos \\left [ \\phi -\\phi _ { p}\\right ] \\cos \\theta \\;\\sin \\theta _ { p}\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{\\phi } & = & -p\\;\\sin \\left [ \\phi -\\phi _ { p}\\right ] \\sin \\theta _ { p }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which explicitly shows that the radius vector components of momentum are a mixture of momentum and radial vector spherical coordinates .",
    "therefore in the phase space density they must be replaced by ( [ pcomp ] ) and then the integration over the spatial coordinates performed . indeed for the  soft  rigid rotor it can be shown that one obtains for the momentum distribution the square modulus of ( [ mom ] ) , but it is not clear what the outcome would be for the true rigid rotor . for the latter it is required that @xmath228 and yet the expression for the phase space density would be a function of @xmath226 and @xmath22 without an obvious restriction of that kind . however , explicit expression for the momentum probability is not of importance , it is important to be able to calculate the averages .",
    "for example the average of the square of the cartesian component @xmath229 , say with the phase space density @xmath230 is given by @xmath231 ^{2}\\rho _ { 2,0}(\\theta , \\phi , p_{\\theta } , p_{\\phi } ) = \\frac{22\\pi } { 7}\\ ] ] where @xmath232 was set .",
