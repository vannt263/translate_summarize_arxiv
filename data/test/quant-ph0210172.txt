    "although the `` no - cloning theorem '' by wootters and zurek @xcite states that it is impossible to copy arbitrary quantum information perfectly , quantum mechanics does allow us to make approximate copies . since buek and hillery first presented a unitary transformation , known as a _",
    "universal quantum cloning machine _ ( uqcm ) , to make two identical approximate copies of an input qubit @xcite , the subject of quantum cloning has been investigated intensely ( for example , see @xcite ) and experiments have recently been carried out @xcite .",
    "one application of quantum cloning is in quantum computation , as copying is a fundamental process in information processing .",
    "it has been shown that there are some quantum - computational tasks whose performance can be enhanced by making use of quantum cloning @xcite .",
    "however , physical realizations of quantum circuits are always fraught with difficulties due to decoherence , as it is virtually impossible to isolate a quantum system from its environment perfectly .    here",
    ", we investigate the circuit complexity of universal quantum cloning and estimate the time @xmath3 a quantum cloning machine requires to make @xmath0 copies of @xmath1 identical pure state inputs . by comparing @xmath3 with the decoherence time @xmath4 of the qubits in a physical system",
    ", we can estimate how @xmath0 or @xmath1 will be restricted and how much quantum information can be copied practically . in order to estimate the decoherence time , one needs to model a specific realization , and several are possible : cavity qed , parametric down - conversion , and ion traps . to provide a concrete example ,",
    "we examine an ion - trap realization of the uqcm network , and assume all instrumental sources of decoherence @xcite have been eliminated , leaving us with spontaneous emission as a well - characterizable source of decoherence .    the analysis of the times @xmath3 and @xmath4 is analogous to that reported in @xcite , in which upper bounds are determined for the bit size @xmath5 of the number to be factorized by using shor s algorithm .    in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the ideas of quantum cloning , and then , in section [ sec_circuit ] , count the number of elementary logical operations needed to build a quantum circuit for @xmath2 cloning . in section [ dec_time ] , we compare the cloning time @xmath3 with the decoherence time @xmath4 of the quantum circuit when it is implemented with trapped ions , as in @xcite .",
    "other sources of decoherence ( vibrational quanta damping , heating , inhomogeneous trap fields , and laser fluctuations ) will also lead to limitations in the number of good quality copies such a uqcm can generate .",
    "the task of a general universal quantum cloning machine is to copy @xmath1 identical pure states , described as @xmath6 , into @xmath0-particle output states ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , with the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the reduced density operators for any one of the @xmath0 outputs are identical to each other , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a reduced density operator with respect to the @xmath11-th particle .",
    "2 .   the quality of the copies does not depend on the input states , i.e. the _ fidelity _ between the input and the output states is independent of the input state .",
    "the fidelity @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 .",
    "the word `` universal '' refers to this condition .",
    "the copies are as close as possible to the input state as a natural requirement for a cloning machine .",
    "thus , the fidelity @xmath12 should be as close as possible to 1 .    here",
    ", we consider only a two - dimensional system ( qubit ) as a physical system , as systems of higher dimension are beyond the scope of current candidates for the realizations of quantum circuits .",
    "the cloning transformation of buek and hillery @xcite makes two copies from one original qubit .",
    "it is written as @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ ucm01 ] ) , the first qubit with subscript @xmath15 is the state to be copied , the second one labelled @xmath16 is the _ blank paper _ that becomes one of the copies after the process , and the qubit with @xmath17 is an ancilla bit which can be regarded as the state of the machine",
    ". the fidelity of this process is found to be @xmath18 , which is independent of the input state , as desired .",
    "buek et al .",
    "also presented a way to construct a quantum network for this uqcm @xcite ( figure [ uqcmnet](a ) ) . in figure [ uqcmnet](a )",
    ", r is a single qubit gate which rotates the basis vectors by an angle @xmath19 as @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 symbols connected with a line denote a controlled not gate ( cnot ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a control bit and a target bit , respectively . by adjusting the rotation angles of three single qubit gates ,",
    "any two of the three states at the output represent copies of the qubit @xmath15 .",
    "uqcm , and ( b ) @xmath23 uqcm .",
    "these circuits consist of two stages , namely the preparation and the copying stages .",
    "the preparation stage provides appropriate amplitudes for orthonormal bases according to eqs .",
    "( 2 ) or ( 4 ) .",
    "the cloning stage permutes those amplitudes among all qubits , entangling them([13 , 14 ] ) . ]",
    "( [ ucm01 ] ) was generalized by gisin and massar @xcite to produce @xmath0 copies out of @xmath1 inputs .",
    "this transformation is described by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the input state consisting of @xmath1 qubits , all in the state @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the symmetric and normalized state with @xmath28 qubits in the state @xmath26 and @xmath29 qubits in the orthogonal state @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 represent the internal state of the machine and @xmath32 holds for all @xmath33 .",
    "buek et al . constructed a quantum circuit for @xmath23 uqcm which explicitly realizes eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) by generalizing the corresponding circuit for the @xmath34 case @xcite .",
    "figure [ uqcmnet](b ) shows their circuit for @xmath23 cloning machine .",
    "it is basically a natural extension of the @xmath34 circuit , consisting a preparation stage and a cloning ( permutation ) stage .",
    "let us consider if it is possible to extend this @xmath23 cloning circuit further to an @xmath2 cloning circuit , by making up a circuit in figure [ n2mnet ] in which the preparation stage is built up with both single and two qubit operations and the cloning stage is a sequence of cnot or similar multi - qubit operation gates .",
    "it turns out that this cloning circuit does work properly for any @xmath0 when @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and many other @xmath1 and @xmath0 as long as the condition ( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "if we are allowed to introduce additional auxiliary qubits inside the cloner , this circuit works for all combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath37 . ]",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) gives us a few hints on the possible construction of the quantum circuit for an @xmath2 uqcm .",
    "first , @xmath38 qubits are necessary to represent the internal states of the machine .",
    "the total number of qubits needed to implement this transformation is @xmath39 .",
    "second , every basis of the form of @xmath40 or @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) is a basis in the symmetrical subspace of the hilbert space @xmath41 or @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the space spanned by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "although the symmetrical subspace is a rather small subspace in the whole hilbert space , almost all computational bases are involved in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) , especially when @xmath1 is small .    therefore",
    ", almost @xmath46 amplitudes need to be distributed to appropriate computational bases to perform the transformation ( [ guqcm ] ) , although the number of distinct amplitudes , @xmath47 , is only @xmath48 .",
    "the fact that such a great number of amplitudes are necessary imposes a certain condition upon the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in order for an @xmath2 cloning machine in figure [ n2mnet ] to work properly .    because the task of the cloning stage which consists of a sequence of cnots is to permute the amplitudes of all basis vectors which span the whole hilbert space , all the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) , @xmath47 , must be provided by the preparation stage .",
    "therefore , the preparation stage should be able to generate an entangled @xmath49-qubit state with a set of any real amplitudes that may appear in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) by adjusting the rotation angles of each single qubit gate .",
    "for example , in the @xmath34 uqcm ( eq .",
    "( [ ucm01 ] ) and figure [ uqcmnet](a ) ) , the amplitudes appearing in the output states are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the preparation stage needs to provide these three coefficients and it turns out that , with the configuration of the cloning stage of figure [ uqcmnet](a ) , the two - qubit state emerging from the preparation stage should be @xmath52 when the third qubit is used as the internal state of the machine .",
    "the rotation angles of the single qubit gates in this stage are determined accordingly",
    ".    however , this scheme only works when the number of distinct computational bases in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) is smaller than the dimension of the hilbert space that the preparation stage deals with .",
    "otherwise , the preparation stage can not generate enough amplitudes required by eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) .",
    "this condition is written as @xmath53 where the lhs represents the number of bases that appear in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) and the rhs is the dimension of the hilbert space where qubits in the preparation stage lie .",
    "( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled for any @xmath0 when @xmath35 , which is the case of figure [ uqcmnet](b ) , and when @xmath36 .",
    "still , it becomes rather complicated when it comes to other combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "an example in which we can see the violation of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) clearly is the case of @xmath54 , where the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) for @xmath55 can be estimated as @xmath56 this always exceeds the corresponding rhs of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) , @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied for @xmath0 which are sufficiently large compared with @xmath1 , since its lhs is approximately @xmath58 , which is smaller than the rhs when @xmath59 .",
    "note that the condition ( [ cond ] ) is not necessary if we are allowed to make use of more auxiliary qubits inside a cloning machine .",
    "providing @xmath39 qubits at most , instead of @xmath49 , enables the preparation stage to generate enough number of amplitudes for the cloning transformation .",
    "then the cloning stage can complete the whole process by allocating those amplitudes to appropriate bases , leaving the auxiliary qubits disentangled , in state @xmath44 , from the legitimate @xmath39 output qubits .",
    "introducing these auxiliary qubits does not affect the estimation of the number of gates , which is discussed in the following .",
    "let us now count the number of elementary gates in the quantum cloning circuit , especially cnot gates , as a cnot gate takes a longer time to be performed than a single qubit gate @xcite .",
    "the preparation stage should be designed so that it generates an arbitrary set of real amplitudes whose number is written by the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) . as far as the quantum cloning transformation eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) is concerned , the amplitudes should not necessarily be arbitrary as they are specifically described as in eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) .",
    "however , in order to keep the full `` controllability '' on the output states , as in the case of @xmath34 uqcm , we assume that the preparation stage can generate arbitrary superpositions of @xmath60 bases with real amplitudes , where @xmath61 is the dimension of the @xmath49-qubit hilbert space .",
    "the transformation that the preparation stage performs can be written as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are real numbers complying with the normalization condition @xmath64 .",
    "this is a unitary transformation which can be described by a @xmath65 matrix , on the @xmath66-dimensional initial state vector @xmath67 , and its components are given by @xmath68 and the rest of them are arbitrary for our purpose .",
    "it is known that an outright circuit implementation of a @xmath69 unitary matrix requires , in general , @xmath70 elementary operations @xcite . however",
    ", a more efficient circuit to create an arbitrary quantum superposition starting from @xmath71 has been proposed in @xcite and its complexity is given by @xmath72 .",
    "thus we simply take @xmath73 as the number of cnots in the preparation stage of a uqcm in the following calculations .",
    "the cloning stage is also generically hard to construct .",
    "the only exception we know of is the case of @xmath23 uqcm , which can be realized by the circuit in figure [ uqcmnet](b ) . in a more generic @xmath2 case",
    ", we can build up a circuit as follows . as mentioned above",
    ", the cloning stage only permutes all bases with non - zero amplitudes among all computational bases of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the number of gates with only the knowledge of number of bases involved , even if we have no information on the actual permutation , i.e. which basis goes to which .",
    ".the permutation of computational bases performed in the cloning stage of the @xmath34 quantum cloning circuit .",
    "the choice of bases on the left hand side follows eq .",
    "( 5 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall , we see that even for a small number of outputs copied from one input the decoherence due to spontaneous emissions plays a critical role . if we make an optimistic assumption for @xmath75 , as @xmath76 , @xmath34 cloning with @xmath77 , @xmath34 and @xmath78 with @xmath79 would become possible .",
    "if we are allowed to have one more auxiliary qubit , the number of basic operations to simulate a @xmath80-controlled operation can be reduced from @xmath81 to @xmath82 @xcite . replacing the corresponding factors in the above calculations",
    "shows that , with @xmath76 , @xmath34 , @xmath83 , and @xmath78 cloning may be possible with @xmath79 as well as @xmath34 and @xmath83 cloning with @xmath77 .",
    "we have first investigated a possible method to construct an @xmath2 quantum cloning circuit in order to estimate the number of cnot gates in it .",
    "we have estimated the number of cnots as @xmath84 , with @xmath1 and @xmath0 the numbers of input and output qubits , respectively .",
    "therefore , the number of gates in the quantum cloning circuit of the type of figure [ uqcmnet](b ) or figure [ n2mnet ] is always exponential with respect to the number of output qubits .    with the circuit complexity we obtained",
    ", it has been shown that the quantum cloning may be implemented by using the system of trapped ions for only a few combinations of small @xmath1 and @xmath0 , when the system is not immune to decoherence due to spontaneous emissions , provided sophisticated quantum error correction codes are not used . as",
    "spontaneous emissions are the only source of decoherence we have considered here , the number of possible combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 might be lowered further by taking into account of other effects , such as phonon decoherence @xcite , the random phase fluctuations of the lasers , the heating of the ions vibrational motion @xcite .    nevertheless , unlike the case of factorization by shor s algorithm @xcite , producing many clones is not necessarily what we expect from the quantum cloning .",
    "since even a few copied qubits may be useful in quantum information processing @xcite , our results should not be interpreted too pessimistically .",
    "furthermore , the use of quantum error correction codes will surely ease the condition for upper bounds .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a quantum information distributor , which is a modification of the quantum cloning circuit , can be used as a universal programmable quantum processor in a probabilistic regime . from this point of view , our estimation on the upper bound for the clones implies physical bounds on the realization of such a processor with trapped ions .    one interesting subject we have not considered here is the effect of decoherence on the quality of the clones .",
    "if we allow a processing time which is longer than the decoherence time , the fidelity between the input and output states will surely be lower than what we expect from eq .",
    "( [ guqcm ] ) .",
    "we might be able to find a tradeoff between the fidelity and the number of cloneable qubits to have `` useful '' clones in terms of practical quantum information processing .",
