    "there is recent interest in applying time  frequency analysis as a tool for capturing various features of a ship wake .",
    "such analysis involves performing many short - time fourier transforms on a cross - section of a ship wake and visualising the resulting data as a spectrogram @xcite . as this approach only requires measurements taken at a single stationary sensor as a ship sails past @xcite , it offers a viable method for analysing ship waves in real - world conditions .",
    "this line of research has a range of potential practical applications in terms of quantifying the negative effects that a propagating wake wash will have when it interacts with a coastal zone @xcite or facilitating remote sensing and surveillance of unmonitored vessels .    before now ,",
    "the published studies on spectrogram analysis of ship wakes use experimental measurements taken from an open body of water @xcite . as such ,",
    "the surface height data involves a complicated combination of information from multiple ships and wind waves .",
    "the resulting interference has made it difficult for previous researchers to confidently attribute features of a spectrogram to various properties of a ship or its wake @xcite . in response to this challenge , pethiyagoda et al .",
    "@xcite used linear water wave theory together with a mathematical model to explain features of spectrograms of ship waves that are small in amplitude .",
    "this explanation includes a derivation of the linear dispersion curve which predicts the location of the colour intensity on the spectrogram when the ship in question is travelling through an infinitely deep body of water .",
    "further , they used a simple weakly nonlinear theory and simulations of the fully nonlinear version of the model to identify features of a spectrogram that are due to nonlinearity .",
    "the comparison between these new theoretical results with data measured in a shipping channel in the gulf of finland is promising @xcite ; however , there is a need to extend the analysis to hold for finite - depth channels and to test the predictions against cleaner data gathered from controlled experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis in @xcite to apply to finite - depth channels .",
    "ship wakes on a finite - depth fluid are interesting because they can be classified as either subcritical ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the depth based froude number ) or supercritical ( @xmath2 ) , with qualitatively different wave patterns forming for each case .",
    "for example , wakes for subcritical flows are made up of transverse waves and divergent waves , while wake for supercritical flows contain divergent waves only .",
    "this difference has a noticeable effect on the linear dispersion relation which , as we show , directly affects the location of the high intensity regions on the spectrograms .",
    "further , we support our theoretical findings by comparing with experimental surface height measurements taken from a model test basin , eliminating the effect of wind waves .",
    "our study begins in section  [ sec : mathematicalmodel ] by presenting our mathematical model , which involves inviscid fluid flow past an applied gaussian - type pressure on the surface . here",
    "the pressure distribution is used as an idealised mathematical representation of a ship and the strength of the pressure ( @xmath3 ) acts as a proxy for the volume of water displaced by the ship . in section  [ sec : spectrograms ]",
    "we extend the geometric argument for determining the linear dispersion curve presented by pethiyagoda et al .",
    "@xcite to include the effects of a finite depth fluid .",
    "we observe the effect of changing the width of the gaussian pressure relative to the water depth ( @xmath4 ) , where the regions of high intensity favour higher frequencies along the dispersion curves for smaller pressure widths .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : experimental ] we validate the new linear and second - order dispersion curves against spectrograms generated from experimental data collected from the model test basin at the australian maritime college .",
    "we observe trends in the experimental spectrograms for different sailing speeds and hull shapes , and provide possible explanations for these trends in terms of linear and nonlinear frequencies .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : interference ] , certain periodic patterns in the spectrograms for vessels with a high aspect ratio are explained in terms of wave interference effects .",
    "in order to simulate a wake left behind a moving ship , we consider the idealised problem of calculating the free surface disturbance created by a steadily moving pressure distribution applied to the surface of a body of water of constant depth @xmath5 . we suppose the pressure distribution is of a gaussian type with strength @xmath6 and characteristic width @xmath7 , and then formulate the mathematical problem in the reference frame of this moving pressure .",
    "we nondimensionalise the problem by scaling all velocities by the speed of the pressure distribution , @xmath8 , and all lengths by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is acceleration due to gravity .",
    "the fully nonlinear governing equations are then @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the velocity potential , @xmath13 is the free - surface height , @xmath14 is the dimensionless pressure strength , @xmath15 is the fluid density and @xmath16 is the pressure distribution . for the present study we will use the pressure distribution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the depth - based froude number and",
    "@xmath19 is the length - based froude number .",
    "we can also define the scaled width of the pressure distribution @xmath20 . in this formulation , @xmath1 is the parameter that measures the speed of the moving pressure , while the pressure strength @xmath3 provides a measure of nonlinearity in the problem ( the regime @xmath21 is approximately linear ) .    our use of the applied pressure ( [ eq : pressure ] ) to act as a mathematical representation of ship is deficient in the sense that it does not allow for precise features of the ship hull to be described in any way . despite this modelling simplification , it is common to use this idea when analysing ship wakes from a mathematical perspective @xcite , and indeed we show that there are many advantages in this approach . to understand the analogy with real ship vessels , it is worth interpreting @xmath3 as a crude measure of the volume of water displaced by a vessel .",
    "further , note that we can easily extend this model to include multiple pressure distributions , as we do later in section  [ sec : interference ] .      for moderate to large values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the mathematical problem ( [ eq : laplace])-([eq : pressure ] ) is highly nonlinear . from a computational perspective , obtaining accurate numerical solutions is challenging as the problem is three - dimensional and the upper surface @xmath22 is unknown and must be solved as part of the solution processes .",
    "progress with the numerical solution to this problem and related problems can made using boundary integral methods @xcite , for example .    on the other hand , for weak pressure distributions , @xmath21 , the problem ( [ eq : laplace])-([eq : pressure ] )",
    "can be linearised .",

    "we see that the wave pattern is comprised of transverse waves that run perpendicular to the direction of travel and divergent waves that are oblique to this direction . on the other hand ,",
    "as noted in the introduction , the wave pattern for the supercritical case contains only divergent waves .",
    "to compute the spectrogram data for a given signal , @xmath34 , we take the square magnitude of a short - time fourier transform @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a window function which is even with compact support . in this paper",
    "we will use the blackman - harris 92db window function @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in a time - frequency heat map of dimensionless angular frequency @xmath37 against scaled time @xmath38 with the colour intensity aligned to @xmath39 .",
    "the signal @xmath34 comes from fixing @xmath40 in the solution and taking @xmath41 , where we recall the nondimensional speed is unity ( @xmath42 ) . for the spectrograms generated by the exact solution to the linear problem ( [ eq : exactlinearfinite ] ) , we have chosen to fix @xmath43 , but it is important to note that for sufficiently large @xmath40 , the spectrograms are visually extremely similar .      by following pethiyagoda et al .",
    "@xcite we now use geometric arguments to determine the linear dispersion curve for ship waves in a finite depth channel .",
    "the key ideas here are borrowed from standard texts @xcite .",
    "first we note that finite - depth linear water waves obey the dispersion relation @xmath44 where @xmath28 is the wavenumber and @xmath45 is the wave frequency for monochromatic waves .",
    "this result implies that the phase and group velocities are given by @xmath46 for the following we also define the ratio of group velocity to phase velocity @xmath47 at this point it is worth emphasising that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) and the wave velocities ( [ eq : phasegroupvel ] ) depend on the froude number @xmath1 , whereas in the infinite depth limit , there is no dependence on velocity ( as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .    in order to compute the linear dispersion curve we consider a ship moving along the path mo a distance of @xmath53 as shown in figure [ fig : specdiagram ] . at the point",
    "m the ship will generate waves in all directions @xmath54 with phase velocity @xmath55 equation ( [ eq : phasevel ] ) together with ( [ eq : phasegroupvel ] ) give a implicit relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath54 via ( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "thus there are bounds on the possible directions that @xmath54 may take . for subcritical flows ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where @xmath30 is the positive root of @xmath58 ,",
    "thus @xmath54 takes all the angles from @xmath59 ( when @xmath29 ) to @xmath60 ( as @xmath61 ) . for supercritical flows ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath62 as @xmath63 and",
    "so @xmath54 lies in the interval between @xmath64 ( when @xmath65 ) to @xmath60 ( as @xmath61 ) .",
    "only certain waves produced at m can contribute to a stationary ship wave pattern .",
    "the energy associated with these waves travels from m at the group velocity to points on the dark blue curve in figure [ fig : specdiagram ] over the time period @xmath53 .",
    "we refer to this curve as the group velocity curve .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath40 coordinates of points on this curve , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 . by substituting in ( [ eq : alphafunc])-([eq : phasevel ] ) , we arrive at the parametric representation @xmath71 where we emphasise that @xmath28 is a function of @xmath54 via ( [ dispersion ] ) . equations ( [ eq : sensorx])([eq : sensory ] ) can be combined to form the equation @xmath72 thus we have an expressions that relates the direction of a wave leaving m ( @xmath54 ) with a wavenumber ( @xmath28 ) and a position relative to the ship when the ship is at o.    we note in passing that , with this picture , we can compute the wedge angle @xmath73 that encloses the entire wave packet by noting that there is a maximum angle at which rays can leave o and intersect the group velocity curve ( dark blue ) .",
    "that is , @xmath74 . for the infinite depth case @xmath75 ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : thetazero ] ) reduces to a simple quadratic ( since @xmath76 in that case ) which gives the well - known kelvin angle @xmath77 . for subcritical flows",
    ", the calculation for @xmath73 must be performed numerically . in the supercritical case ,",
    "the maximum occurs when @xmath64 ( see figure [ fig : specdiagram](b ) ) , which gives the result @xmath78",
    ".    if a sensor is at given position relative to the ship , @xmath79 , then for subcritical flows there are two group velocity curves ( one dark blue and one light blue ) that pass through @xmath79 ( see figure  [ fig : specdiagram](a ) ) and so two pairs of @xmath54 and @xmath28 which we label @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "these are found by solving ( [ eq : thetazero ] ) numerically . for supercritical flows",
    "there is only one relevant group velocity curve ( dark blue ) and so only one solution to ( [ eq : thetazero ] ) for @xmath83 and @xmath84 . either way , for a stationary sensor at @xmath79 , the angular frequency observed by the sensor , @xmath37 , is given by @xmath85 finally , to generate the linear dispersion curve , we plot @xmath86 versus @xmath87 .",
    "note that when we draw our dispersion curves on a spectrogram , the sensor relative to the ship is moving with dimensionless speed unity , so our plots are actually of @xmath86 versus @xmath88 .",
    "( while we are only considering stationary sensors in this study , we note that if the sensor is moving with nondimensional speed @xmath89 in the direction @xmath90 relative to the sailing line of the ship , the relationship ( [ eq : observedfrequency ] ) generalises to @xmath91 the dispersion curve is drawn by defining the location of the sensor as a function of time , @xmath92 , where @xmath66 and @xmath40 are the location of the sensor at @xmath93 . for the stationary sensor we have @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . )    a plot of the linear dispersion curve for a variety of depth - based froude numbers is presented in figure  [ fig : lindisp ] . in each case",
    ", these curves help to predict the location of the high intensity regions of a spectrogram of a ship wake ( see section  [ sec : linearspectrogram ] ) .",
    "the special case @xmath75 is the linear dispersion curve for an infinitely deep fluid , as calculated in pethiyagoda et al .",
    "it is made up of two branches .",
    "the upper branch ( corresponding to @xmath97 ) indicates a sliding frequency mode which represents the divergent waves , while the lower branch ( @xmath98 ) describes a constant frequency mode representing the transverse waves . the left - most point on the linear dispersion curve ,",
    "@xmath99 , gives the first time that the wave reaches the sensor , again providing the kelvin wake angle since the sensor relative to the ship is @xmath100 .",
    "moving on to the finite - depth case , the sliding frequency mode of each dispersion curve behaves like @xmath101 as @xmath102 .",
    "this property is shared by all dispersions curves , regardless of froude number . for subcritical froude numbers ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the linear dispersion curve is qualitatively similar to the infinite depth case .",
    "quantitatively , we see that the frequency of the @xmath98 mode decreases as @xmath1 increases until the limit @xmath103 as @xmath104 , which is consistent with the property that the wavelength of transverse waves increases to infinity in this critical limit .",
    "the left - most point @xmath105 also decreases as @xmath1 increases , meaning the wave pattern reaches the sensor earlier , reflecting the result that the wedge angle increases for subcritical froude numbers until @xmath106 as @xmath104 . for supercritical froude numbers ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the linear dispersion curve is qualitatively different , as there is now only one branch , for divergent waves ( @xmath97 branch ) .",
    "this curve intersects the @xmath38 axis at @xmath107 and is monotonically increasing with @xmath38 .",
    "is plotted for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed curve follows the earliest point of the dispersion curve with the arrow indicating the direction of increasing @xmath1 .",
    "an inset of the range @xmath108 is also provided . ]      in the infinite - depth case , pethiyagoda et al .",
    "@xcite provide a simple formula for determining the second - order dispersion curves , which come from a weakly nonlinear approximation . for subcritical flows ,",
    "the idea carries over directly , to give @xmath109 for @xmath110 ( recall @xmath97 represents the divergent waves while @xmath98 represents the transverse waves ) . for supercritical flows",
    "there are no transverse waves , so the second - order dispersion curve is simply @xmath111 .",
    "we return to these weakly nonlinear approximations later .",
    "we now present in figure [ fig : linspec ] spectrograms calculated from the exact solution ( [ eq : exactlinearfinite ] ) to the linearised problem of flow past a pressure distribution . in each case",
    "the cross - section of the wave pattern is defined by @xmath43 and the subsequent wave signal is included in the figure directly above the spectrogram .",
    "we have chosen to present results for @xmath32 , which is representative of a subcritical depth - based froude number ( far - field dimensional velocity @xmath8 less than @xmath112 , where @xmath5 is the dimensional channel height ) , and @xmath33 , representative of a supercritical depth - based froude number ( @xmath113 ) . in each regime",
    "we have shown spectrograms for four different values of the length - based froude number @xmath114 .",
    "for a physical interpretation , recall the `` width '' of the gaussian pressure distribution is @xmath115 so , for a fixed @xmath1 , the width of the pressure decreases as @xmath114 increases .",
    "the first observation from this figure is that in all eight cases , the high intensity region of the spectrogram appears to be centred on the linear dispersion curve described in section  [ sec : dispcurve ] .",
    "thus we can see that the linear dispersion curves do a very good job of indicating where the high intensity regions can fall . however , we see that that for low length - based froude numbers , the high intensity regions a more prominent at lower frequencies , while for high length - based froude numbers the high intensity regions move up to higher frequencies .",
    "this shows that for finite - depth flows , spectrograms appear to contain more information than for infinite - depth flows , which is not unexpected given the additional parameter in the model .",
    "this observation is of practical interest , especially if the application was to employ spectrograms of data taken at a single point in order to unpick various features of a moving vessel .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     spectrograms for the sixteen experimental runs are presented in figure [ fig : experspec ] , together with the linear dispersion curves ( solid curves ) .",
    "we see that the linear dispersion curves do a good job of predicting the most dominant area of high colour intensity of the spectrogram .",
    "we therefore attribute the colour intensity along the linear dispersion curve to linear ship waves generated by the hull .",
    "this is an important observation because it provides strong evidence that the simple geometric argument in section  [ sec : dispcurve ] provides an excellent `` leading order '' guess of a ship s spectrogram , regardless of the actual properties of the ship s hull .",
    "we now consider nonlinear effects on the spectrograms by including the second - order dispersion curves ( dashed curves ) in figure  [ fig : experspec ] . for subcritical flows ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "we only show the second - order dispersion curves @xmath116 and @xmath117 because they were the most prevalent in the nonlinear numerical simulations performed by pethiyagoda et al .",
    "@xcite for the infinite - depth counterpart . for supercritical flows ( @xmath2 )",
    "there is only one second - order curve .",
    "the first observation about these second - order curves is that in the subcritical examples they do not coincide with high intensity regions of the spectrograms , which suggests that the four examples we present in this regime are essentially linear flows . turning to supercritical flows ,",
    "we see the second - order dispersion curves align with areas of colour intensity in the spectrogram , especially for lower aspect ratio hulls ( amc 00 - 01 and amc 97 - 10 ) .",
    "thus we propose that the examples for amc 00 - 01 and amc 97 - 10 have higher amplitude waves which are weakly nonlinear in nature .",
    "indeed , it seems that nonlinearity is strongest for lower aspect ratio hulls , which suggests that ship wave patterns are more nonlinear if the volume of fluid displaced by the surface - piercing hull is higher .",
    "this notion supports the modelling assumption that the strength of an applied pressure distribution can act as a proxy for the volume of water displaced by a hull .    for the supercritical flows ( @xmath2 )",
    ", there is a significant amount of colour intensity occurring away from the linear and second - order dispersion curves that can not be explained by our linear or weakly nonlinear theory .",
    "instead , we believe much of this intensity is due to wave reflection . to support this idea , we have plotted two additional linear dispersion curves ( long - dashed curves ) representing ship waves that have reflected perfectly off the starboard and port side walls of the model test basin .",
    "thus , in essence we assume the existence of two `` ghost '' ships travelling in line with the experimental ship , but further away from the sensor .",
    "the reflected curves are computed by recalling that the shape of the dispersion curve depends on the depth - based froude number and is a function of @xmath38 , where @xmath40 is the minimum distance to the sailing line . given that each additional ghost ship has the same depth based froude number , the reflected dispersion curve can be expressed by rescaling the horizontal axis by @xmath118 ( that is if @xmath119 is linear dispersion curve , @xmath120 is the reflected dispersion curve ) , where @xmath121 is the distance from the sensor to the ghost ship s sailing line .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : experspec ] that the reflected dispersion curves seem to align with much of the colour intensity of the larger froude number spectrograms , providing strong evidence that these regions of high intensity are in fact due to wave reflection .",
    "this alignment is quite promising given the assumption of perfect reflection , which may be too idealised to accurately reflect the experimental spectrograms .",
    "we note that there is no evidence of wave reflection in the subcritical examples ( @xmath0 ) because the reflected waves had not reached the sensor by the time the sensor had finished recording the surface height data .",
    "there is one more feature of our experimental spectrograms which we wish to investigate further .",
    "we see in the subcritical examples in figure  [ fig : experspec ] that there appears to be periodic regions of low intensity ( blue dots ) that roughly follow the sliding - frequency ( @xmath97 ) mode .",
    "a potential explanation for these oscillations in colour intensity is the wave interference that is well known to occur from the interaction between waves generated by the bow and stern of a ship s hull @xcite .    to observe the effects of wave interference in our mathematical model",
    ", we consider a two - point wave - maker which consists of two gaussian pressure distributions , one ahead of the other .",
    "an exact solution for linear ship waves caused by such a two - point wave - maker is given by @xmath122 where @xmath13 is given by equation ( [ eq : exactlinearfinite ] ) and @xmath123 is the nondimensional distance between the two pressure distributions .    ) and its associated spectrogram , where @xmath32 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which approximate the values for the amc 98 - 08 hull travelling at 1 ms@xmath128 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the location of the cross - section taken to form the signal used for the spectrogram .",
    "the signal is presented above the spectrogram . ]    in figure [ fig : lin2point ] we provide an example of a spectrogram generated from the ship wake created by a two - point wave - maker with @xmath32 , @xmath125 , @xmath124 and @xmath126 ( these are approximate parameter values for the amc 98 - 08 hull travelling at 1 ms@xmath128 ) .",
    "we can clearly see the almost - periodic nature of the colour intensity ( including blue dots ) along the sliding frequency mode that occurs as a result of including a second pressure distribution .",
    "further , we can match the oscillating low and high intensity regions with the wave signal itself , which is placed directly above in the figure .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : lin2point ] are for one example only , but we can infer from our mathematical model that wave interference is likely to manifest itself in a spectrogram for a real vessel with a large aspect ratio .",
    "this is consistent with our observations of experimental results in figure  [ fig : experspec ] , since the periodic blue dots along the sliding frequency mode appear more prominent as the aspect ratio increases .",
    "broadly speaking , fourier analysis has recently been adopted as a tool for understanding the underlying features of a measured ship wake @xcite .",
    "one form of analysis is performing a two - dimensional fourier transform on the measured surface height  @xcite .",
    "while this approach can provide information for the entire ship wave ( both near and far field ) , the methods for measuring the free - surface height ( e.g. the use of fluid seeded particles @xcite or a projected laser grid @xcite ) can be impractical in real world settings .",
    "in contrast , in the present study we are interested in a form of time ",
    "frequency analysis that involves performing many short - time fourier transforms on a cross - section of a ship s wake and plotting the result as a spectrogram @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of this approach is that the required data can be collected at a single fixed sensor , which in practice is a relatively simple exercise .",
    "we have considered a mathematical model for generating a ship wake where the ship itself is represented by a pressure distribution applied to the surface of the water .",
    "we have used geometric arguments and an exact solution ( of the linearised problem ) to predict where the dominant regions of high intensity will fall on a spectrogram from this model . by varying the depth - based froude number ,",
    "we have shown how transverse and divergent waves appear on spectrograms for both subcritical and supercritical regimes .",
    "the effects of nonlinearity , wave reflection and wave interference have also been considered . by comparing with experimental results for realistic hull shapes",

    ", there is a need to explore in some detail the effect of using a more realistic mathematical model that takes into account specific design features of realistic ship hulls .",
    "this includes further studying the effect of wave interference for long and thin ship hulls and vessels with multiple hulls .",
    "the issue of nonlinearity needs further attention , especially in terms of solitary waves ( precursor solitons ) that propagate ahead of a vessel moving at near - critical speed ( @xmath129 ) @xcite . from an experimental perspective",
