    "in many scenarios , the gravitational dynamics is successfully described by einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) , which has a large observational support @xcite .",
    "however there is also a strong empirical motivation , mainly associated with astronomical observations , that alternative theories of gravity could be useful in order to describe phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy , or the process of inflation suffered by the early universe .",
    "many of these theories are based in the use scalar fields .",
    "the inclusion of scalar fields in physics has a vital role .",
    "scalar fields for example appear in the brans - dicke theory as an attempt to incorporate mach s principle in a gravitational theory @xcite , in inflationary theories , and as a possible candidate of dark matter . on the other hand in particle physics ,",
    "the higgs boson is a fundamental piece of the standard model , and its recent discovery gives a firm ground to the realization of scalar fields in nature .",
    "moreover , scalar fields are also ubiquitous in string theory and kaluza - klein compactifications of higher dimensional theories .",
    "the study of scalar - tensor theories have recently attracted considerable attention due to the development of galileon theories and their applications @xcite . in particular , these ideas led the re - discovery of the most general scalar - tensor theory which has second order field equations and second order energy - momentum tensor ; a problem that was solved by horndeski @xcite in the early seventies . in a curved four - dimensional background , the most general lagrangian that can be constructed with these properties",
    "is given by:@xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant , @xmath2 are arbitrary functions of the scalar @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an arbitrary function of the scalar field and its squared gradient , i.e. @xmath5 . the first term is a nonminimal coupling between the scalar and the four - dimensional gauss - bonnet density , the second includes a nonminimal coupling between the standard kinetic term and the einstein tensor , the third one is a nonminimal coupling between the field and the ricci scalar , while the fourth term since it is defined by an arbitrary function it might include an additive term which may act as a cosmological term in the action .",
    "the last term is just the pointryagin term which is a boundary term and does not contribute to the field equations .",
    "from here we see that it is possible to have scalar field lagrangians whose kinetic term has non - minimal derivative couplings with the curvature .",
    "let us consider kinetic terms @xmath6 which are quadratic in the derivatives of the field in arbitrary dimension @xmath7 .",
    "requiring second order energy - momentum tensor as well as linear and second order equation for the field , restricts @xmath6 to be a linear combination of the following basic terms:@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-@xmath11 order lovelock tensors @xmath12 the standard kinetic term is recovered with @xmath13 . since @xmath14 is proportional to the einstein tensor ,",
    "the first non - standard term in ( [ familyn ] ) already includes a non - minimal kinetic coupling of the scalar and the curvature .    in this work",
    "we will consider the following action principle : @xmath15=\\int\\sqrt{-g}d^{d}x\\ \\left [   \\kappa\\left (   r-2\\lambda \\right )   -\\frac{1}{2}\\left (   \\alpha g_{\\mu\\nu}-\\eta g_{\\mu\\nu}\\right ) \\nabla^{\\mu}\\phi\\nabla^{\\nu}\\phi\\right ]   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where we have taken the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological term in the gravity sector , while the matter sector is given by a real scalar field with a non - minimal kinetic coupling ( here @xmath16 ) .",
    "the possible values of the dimensionfull parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be determined below according with the positivity of the energy density of the matter field .",
    "numerical solutions in the case when an electromagnetic field is present were found in @xcite , where phase transitions to charged black holes with complex anisotropic scalar hair were explored . the first exact black hole solution to this system , in the case of a vanishing cosmological term @xmath19 , was found by rinaldi in @xcite .",
    "there , the scalar field becomes imaginary in the domain of outer communication , and the weak energy condition is violated outside the horizon .",
    "here we extend the results of @xcite and show that the inclusion of a cosmological term in the action makes possible finding a black hole with a real scalar field outside the horizon . by a suitable regularization of the action",
    ", we explore the thermal properties of the spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "we show that for a region in the space of parameters , there is a phase transition as in general relativity with a negative cosmological constant we also extend the solution to the topological case in arbitrary dimension @xmath20 and show that the cosmological term allows to obtain a non - trivial solution when @xmath21 . in this case",
    "we obtain an asymptotically flat black hole .",
    "the field equations for the metric and the scalar field are : @xmath22 @xmath23   = 0\\label{eqphi}\\ ] ] where.]:@xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will consider a gauge fixed version of the most general , cohomogeneity one , static spacetime ( which is not a direct product):@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the line element a closed , @xmath27-dimensional euclidean space of a constant curvature @xmath28 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the space @xmath30 is locally a sphere , for @xmath31 it is locally flat and for @xmath32 it locally reduces to a hyperbolic space .",
    "hereafter we will consider a static and isotropic scalar field , i.e. @xmath33 .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 the four - dimensional solution is given for arbitrary @xmath34 . in order to constraint the couplings ,",
    "the weak energy condition is imposed on the scalar field . in section 3 ,",
    "the geometry of the spherically symmetric solution is described in detail as well it s thermal properties .",
    "we compute the temperature , the mass and the entropy following the hawking - page approach , and show that the first law is satisfied .",
    "we prove that further restrictions on the integration constant come from requiring the black hole to have positive entropy , and show that for a certain region in the space of parameters there is a hawking - page phase transition . in section 4 , the solution in arbitrary dimension @xmath7 is given . finally in section 5 , the solution in the special case @xmath21 is analyzed , which gives rise to an asymptotically locally flat black hole . in this paper",
    "we use the signature @xmath35 , greek and latin indices stand for indices in the coordinate basis .    _",
    "note added : while the first version of this work was being finished the article @xcite appeared on arxiv which has some overlap with our four dimensional solution . _",
    "for the static ansatz considered here , one has that the equation for the field ( [ eqphi ] ) admits a first integral , which implies the relation:@xmath36   g(r)-1\\ , \\label{eqfieldfixed}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is an integration constant , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 stands for derivation with respect to @xmath40 . as in reference @xcite , in order to obtain an exact solution we ( arbitrarily ) choose @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ eqfieldfixed ] ) in addition to the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components of ( [ eqmetric ] ) , provides a consistent system which for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , has the following solution @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48  where @xmath49 is an integration constant .",
    "here we have defined the effective ( a)ds radius @xmath50 by @xmath51 in the case of a locally flat transverse section ( @xmath31 ) the solution reduces to topological schwarzschild solution with locally flat horizons @xcite : @xmath52 @xmath53 and can be obtained from the one with arbitrary @xmath34 by taking the formal limit @xmath54 .",
    "note that in both cases , the solution obtained by replacing @xmath55 is the same than the former if we replace as well @xmath56 .",
    "as mentioned above , from equation ( [ psisol ] ) one can see explicitly that the sign of @xmath57 is determined by the sign of the combination @xmath58 , and therefore regardless the sign of @xmath59 , the inclusion of a cosmological term in the action allows for the existence of asymptotically ( a)ds black holes with a real scalar field in the outer domain of communication .",
    "it can be seen that this solution is asymptotically locally ds or ads for @xmath60 or @xmath61 , respectively , since when @xmath62 the components of the riemann tensor go to@xmath63 justifying our previous definition of the effective ( a)ds radius ( [ defl ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic expansion ( @xmath64 ) of the metric functions is@xmath65 where @xmath66 is the sign of the combination @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    ", there is a curvature singularity at @xmath69 since for example the ricci scalar diverges as@xmath70    if the combination @xmath71 vanishes , one can see that the scalar field reduces to a constant and the metric reduces to the topological schwarzschild - ads solution of general relativity .    for @xmath72 ,",
    "the metric is disconnected from the maximally symmetric ads vacua , i.e. that in this case it is not possible to set @xmath49 to some value such that the metric reduces to ads .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath73 it is possible to show that all the components of the riemann tensor @xmath74 are finite when @xmath75 .",
    "all the algebraic curvature invariants @xmath76 , i.e. those constructed out from contractions of the riemann tensor without involving covariant derivatives , can be written as linear combinations of products of the components of the riemann tensor with the index structure @xmath74 without involving metric factor .",
    "therefore , the finiteness of the components of the riemann tensor with this index structure ensures the finiteness of all the algebraic curvature invariants . for @xmath73",
    "the scalar field is finite at the origin , therefore invariants of the form @xmath77 will be finite for arbitrary @xmath78 .",
    "this has important consequences , because it suggests considering the spacetime with @xmath73 as a background to define a regularized euclidean action .",
    "as described below , the solution with @xmath73 actually defines a gravitational soliton .",
    "if @xmath79 is the energy density , then the total energy @xmath80  is given by:@xmath81 where @xmath82 stands for the volume of @xmath83 .",
    "therefore:@xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a local frame .",
    "now , the @xmath42 component of the energy momentum tensor reads:@xmath87   \\ .\\ ] ] as expected for a matter action that is quadratic in the derivatives of the field , the positivity of the energy density is in close relation with the reality of the scalar itself , which is determined by the sign of the combination @xmath58 as can be seen from equation ( [ psisol ] ) . in the following section we analyze in detail the case @xmath29 and",
    "compute the thermal properties of these black holes .",
    "in the spherically symmetric case , the metric functions and the square of the derivative of the scalar field take the form : @xmath88@xmath89 @xmath90 since the lapse function has a term including the combination @xmath91 , we can see that @xmath17 and @xmath18 need to have the same sign ; @xmath92 will be positive definite and therefore the spacetime is asymptotically locally ads . without loosing generality , we consider @xmath17 and @xmath18 positive , since the solution with both @xmath17 and @xmath18 negative is equivalent to the former by changing @xmath93 .",
    "the reality of the field in the asymptotic region implies @xmath94 , which in our case imposes @xmath95 . under these conditions",
    "one can see that the solution describes a black hole with a non - degenerate horizon for @xmath96 , which is located at @xmath97 .",
    "since the horizon is non - degenerate , @xmath98 while @xmath99 , therefore close to the horizon , we have : @xmath100 for some constant @xmath101 , which implies that the scalar field vanishes at the horizon and it is non - analytic there .",
    "if @xmath72 , it is important to realize that it is not possible to switch off the scalar field and therefore our solution is not continuously connected with a globally maximally symmetric background .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to show , as it occurs in the @xmath102 case @xcite , that within this family , the only regular spacetime is obtained by setting @xmath73 . in this case",
    "the metric describes an asymptotically ads gravitational soliton . near @xmath69 , after a proper rescaling of the time coordinate , the soliton metric reduces to:@xmath103 therefore one can see explicitly that it has a regular origin .",
    "the thermal version of such spacetime can be considered as the background metric to obtain a regularized euclidean action along the lines of hawking - page @xcite , and to obtain therefore the thermodynamics of the black holes .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "the regularized euclidean action is defined by:@xmath104   -i_{e}\\left [   g_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\left ( 0\\right )   } , \\phi^{\\left (   0\\right )   } \\right ]   \\ , \\label{regul action}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the metric and the scalar field respectively for the gravitational soliton , which are obtained by setting @xmath73 in the black hole solution defined by the functions ( [ fsph ] ) to ( [ psisph ] ) .",
    "removing the conical singularity at the horizon of the euclidean black hole solution , requires the period of the euclidean time to be fixed as@xmath108 in order for equation ( [ regul action ] ) to define a regularized action we need to consider a thermal gravitational soliton . if we denote the period of the euclidean time for the soliton by @xmath109 , we need to impose the redshifted temperatures to match : @xmath110 and then take the limit @xmath111 in the regularized action .",
    "since in order to fulfill the weak energy condition @xmath19 must be negative , we can define @xmath112 the divergences in the regularized action cancel and further defining @xmath113 , the regularized action reduces to : @xmath114   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath115 the w.e.c . imposes the following constraint:@xmath116",
    "this is , the ads length of the asymptotic region ( @xmath50 ) , has to be larger than the ads length defined by the cosmological term in the action ( @xmath115 ) given by ( [ lcero ] ) .    as follow from the convention we are using defined in @xcite , in the canonical ensemble we relate the euclidean action to the free energy by @xmath117 ,",
    "therefore:@xmath118 using our definition of the ads radius @xmath50 as well as the definition of @xmath115 given in ( [ lcero ] ) , the temperature is given by:@xmath119 while the mass reads@xmath120\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the entropy reduces to:@xmath121   \\label{entropy}\\ ] ] one can further check that with these expressions the first law of black hole thermodynamics@xmath122 is fulfilled .",
    "for any positive @xmath123 , there is a horizon and therefore from equation ( [ entropy ] ) one sees that requiring @xmath124 to be positive might induce some restrictions on the couplings and @xmath123 .",

    "as it occurs for schwarzschild - ads in vacuum , the expression for the temperature given in ( [ temperature ] ) has a minimum at@xmath131 where the temperature takes its minimum value@xmath132 therefore there are no black holes with @xmath133 , while for a given temperature @xmath134 there are two possible black holes .    in the canonical ensemble",

    "a similar situation occurs with the ads soliton , which can be considered as the background for some topological ads black holes , as well as in gravity in 2 + 1 with scalar fields , where the gravitational solitons are the right backgrounds to consider to give a microscopic description of the black hole entropies @xcite-@xcite .",

    "we have shown that in a certain region of the space of parameters , the thermal soliton will tend to tunnel to large black holes . in opposition to what occurs in general relativity , there is also a range of temperatures for which small black holes are more probable than large black holes .    even though it is probably not possible to give an exact , closed form for the general static black hole solution of horndeski theory , there are some particular subsets of theories that might offer the possibility of finding exact solutions . for example , in dimensions higher than four , since the lovelock tensors are non - trivial , it would be interesting look for black holes with scalar field in which the kinetic couplings are constructed with such lovelock tensors . in some of those theories ,",
    "the kinetic term will be constructed with the field equations of a gravity theory that has an extra symmetry @xcite , and this might help in the integration of the field equations .",
    "other theories that belong to horndeski family are theories with invariance under local weyl rescaling . in reference @xcite it was shown that it is possible to construct theories that generalize the usual conformally coupled scalar field , including couplings of the scalar with euler densities of higher degree ( e.g. @xmath173 ) .",
