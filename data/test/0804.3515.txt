    "the low redshifts can be attributed to the absorption of vhe @xmath1-rays by the iibr . however , the level of the iibr in the local universe and its evolution with redshift are very difficult to measure directly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the iibr and the resulting optical depth of the universe to @xmath3 absorption and pair production are still a matter of intensive debate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath3 opacity of the universe for gev ",

    "therefore , any observed vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum with a local photon spectral index @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 [ ph/(@xmath10  s ) ] @xmath11 ) corresponds to an intrinsic spectral index @xmath12 at the source , i.e. , the intrinsic vhe @xmath1-ray emission at the source must not only be more luminous , but its spectrum must also be harder than the observed one . a strict upper limit on the intensity of the iibr at the maximum of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) around 1.5  @xmath13 m of @xmath14  nw  m@xmath15  sr@xmath16 has been inferred by @xcite based on the argument that any plausible mechanism of particle acceleration and radiative cooling will result in an effective particle spectral lindex @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) .",

    "requiring that @xmath21 @xcite allows a low intensity iibr that is compatible with observations @xcite .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations by @xcite indicated that particle spectra with @xmath22 can result from diffusive shock acceleration at relativistic shocks , which loosens the constraints on the iibr inferred by @xcite . in this context",

    "subsequent radiative cooling will then produce relativistic electron spectra with a canonical index of @xmath24 .",
    "based on the iibr spectrum inferred from the constraints described above , @xcite reconstructed the intrinsic vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum of the hbl 1es  1101 - 232 at @xmath25 , which has recently been detected as a vhe @xmath1-ray source by the h.e.s.s .",

    "tev spectrum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is because at those energies the ssc spectrum exhibits strong intrinsic curvature due to klein - nishina effects : the number of soft photons that can efficiently be scattered ( in the thomson regime ) steadily decreases with increasing scattered ( @xmath1-ray ) photon energy .",

    "one way to overcome this problem could be a very high low - energy cutoff of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath30 ) , as recently suggested by @xcite .",

    "the extremely hard intrinsic gev ",
    "tev spectrum of 1es  1101 - 232 might suggest that there is an additional , very hard spectral component emerging above the ssc emission at those photon energies . here",
    "we propose that such a component could be produced through compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation in the extended region of the jet .",

    "the x - ray spectra of many of those extended jet components are very hard with @xmath31 , suggesting that even in the case of mildly beamed jets of non - blazar radio - loud agn such emission might extend into the mev  gev range .",
    "it seems then worthwhile to investigate whether in the case of blazars , such an emission component could even extend into the gev ",
    "tev regime and produce a quasi - steady plateau of very hard vhe emission .    throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to @xmath32 as the energy spectral index , @xmath33  [ jy ]  @xmath34 and the photon spectral index @xmath35 . a cosmology with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  km  s@xmath16  mpc@xmath16",
    "is used . in this cosmology , and using the redshift of @xmath25 , the luminosity distance of 1es  1101 - 232 is @xmath39  mpc .",
    "the cmb at the source at redshift @xmath40 is a thermal blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath41  k. its local energy density is @xmath42  ergs  @xmath43 . for the purpose of an analytical estimate , the cmb can be approximated as a monochromatic radiation field at a normalized mean photon energy @xmath44 .",
    "if the emission region is moving with respect to the local agn frame with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath45 , the cmb radiation field is boosted into the comoving frame by a factor of @xmath45 in photon energy and a factor of @xmath46 in energy density . in the following , we scale @xmath47 , and , accordingly , the doppler boosting factor @xmath48 \\right)^{-1 } \\equiv 10 \\ , d_1 $ ] , where @xmath49 is the observing angle .",
    "primed quantities refer to the co - moving frame of the emission region .",
    "efficient compton upscattering of the cmb into the @xmath1-ray regime with the observed very hard intrinsic spectrum of 1es  1101 - 232 , requires that the scattering occurs in the thomson regime which is possible for electrons with lorentz factors of @xmath50 .",
    "such electrons will compton scatter cmb photons up to energies of @xmath51 or @xmath52  tev in the observer s frame .",
    "thus , if electrons can be accelerated to tev energies , they will be able to upscatter cmb photons into the tev regime in the thomson limit . specifically , to scatter a cmb photon up to 1  tev in the observer s frame , a comoving electron lorentz factor of @xmath53 is required .",
    "the radiative cooling time scale due to compton cooling in the co - moving frame is    @xmath54    based on this cooling time scale it will in principle be possible to accelerate electrons out to @xmath55 for magnetic field values exceeding @xmath56  g , which does not impose a serious constraint .",
    "cmb compton cooling will dominate over synchrotron cooling for a co - moving magnetic field value of    @xmath57    the resulting synchrotron emission produced by electrons with energy @xmath55 will peak at @xmath58  hz , i.e. , typically in the uv or soft x - ray bands .",
    "the dominance of cmb compton cooling over synchrotron cooling is required in order for the cmb compton emission to be at least at a comparable level to the synchrotron emission from the same electrons .",
    "the required low magnetic fields are much lower than the magnetic field strengths inferred for the presumably near - central ( sub - pc ) regions of the jet from where the bulk of the observed optical  x - ray ",
    "gev @xmath1-ray emission from blazars is generally believed to originate .",
    "this points towards an origin in the outer ( pc  kpc scale ) regions of the jet , where the magnetic fields might approach characteristic interstellar magnetic field values of a few tens of @xmath13 g .",
    "the resulting magnetic jet luminosity will be @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath16 , where @xmath60 is the ( poorly constrained ) cross - sectional radius of the jet in units of @xmath61  cm , and thus several orders of magnitudes less than the total luminosity required to power the emission .",
    "this indicates that the jets must be particle dominated at the site of the vhe @xmath1-ray production through cmb upscattering , even for a pc - scale transverse extent of the jet .",
    "a key prediction from the inferred long cooling time scale given above is that the cmb compton emission , as well as the synchrotron emission associated with the same emission region , will be slowly variable .",
    "this is another reason why the magnetic - field energy density in the vhe emitting region should be lower than the cmb energy density : otherwise this would contradict the observations of rapid variability throughout the synchrotron component ( in particular , at optical and x - ray frequencies ) of most blazars , including 1es  1101 - 232 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore argue that the rapidly variable synchrotron emission originates on substantially smaller ( sub - pc ) scales along the jet than the vhe emission .",
    "based on the similarity of the optical and x - ray characteristics of 1es  1101 - 232 @xcite with previously known tev blazars , @xcite and @xcite predicted that 1es  1101 - 232 might be detectable by the now operating generation of vhe @xmath1-ray detectors .",
    "prompted by these predictions , @xcite performed three sets of coordinated optical ",
    "vhe @xmath1-ray observations in 2004 and 2005 , which resulted in its detection at vhe @xmath1-rays .",
    "this made 1es  1101 - 232 the highest - redshift bl  lac object detected in vhe @xmath1-rays at the time ( now surpassed by 1es  1011 + 496 at @xmath62 , @xcite ) and the second - farthest vhe @xmath1-ray source known , only topped by the quasar - type blazar 3c  279 at @xmath63 , for which the magic collaboration recently claimed a vhe detection @xcite .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of 1es  1101 - 232 provided no evidence for variability at vhe @xmath1-rays . figs . [",
    "1101_march05 ] and [ 1101_june04 ] show the simultaneous optical  x - ray ",
    "vhe @xmath1-ray spectra during two of the three h.e.s.s .",
    "observing windows , where the vhe @xmath1-ray points have been corrected for @xmath3 absorption by the iibr as described in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all of the known observational facts on 1es  1101 - 232 do not allow very meaningful constraints on the parameters of the kpc - scale jets of 1es  1101 - 232 beyond a constraint on the overall jet power : the power injected into the jet on kpc scales obviously needs to exceed the observed radio power of the extended radio structure at 1.5  ghz , @xmath64  erg / s @xcite .",
    "following arguments presented for the x - ray emission from extended jets of other agn , indicating that the jets remain highly relativistic out to kpc scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume a characteristic lorentz factor of @xmath65 . based on the discussion in the previous section , an extension of the cmb compton emission into the tev regime requires electrons with energies up to @xmath66 . in order for the ( non - variable ) synchrotron emission from the tev emission region not to dominate the observed x - ray emission , a magnetic field of @xmath67 g is required .    in order to evaluate the resulting broadband spectrum from a relativistic jet component",
    ", we have incorporated the process of cmb compton scattering into the jet radiation transfer code described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we used the head - on approximation for compton scattering in the thomson regime to treat the compton scattering process and describe the cmb as a thermal blackbody at @xmath68  k.    a reasonable representation of the vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1101_march05 ] can be achieved using an electron injection index of @xmath69 , a luminosity injected in relativistic electrons into the kpc - scale jet of @xmath70  ergs  s@xmath16 , and a co - moving magnetic field of @xmath71 g . obviously , these parameters are not tightly constrained , given that only the rather small spectral range of the vhe spectrum is fitted .",
    "the fits are insensitive to a low - energy cutoff @xmath72 of the electron spectrum , at least as long as @xmath73 .",
    "the same choice of parameters provides an equally acceptable fit to the sed of june 5  10 , 2004 , as shown in fig . [",
    "1101_june04 ] .",
    "as expected ( and required ) , the predicted synchrotron emission from the extended jet region is about two orders of magnitude below the measured sed for both observation periods . in order to provide a fit to the synchrotron component of 1es  1101 - 232",
    ", we chose parameters more appropriate for the inner ( sub - pc ) region of the jet , as listed in the figure captions . note that the jet powers quoted there refer only to the power carried by the ultrarelativistic particle content . in the fits to the synchrotron component , we have chosen the magnetic field in equipartition with the ultrarelativistic electron population in the emission region in order to reduce the number of free parameters .",
    "although the parameters for the fits to both the synchrotron and the vhe components are not very well constrained , the general picture that emerges is that the cmb - compton interpretation for the vhe emission requires a substantially larger kinetic luminosity of ultrarelativistic electron injection into the emission region on large scales than inferred for the synchrotron component at sub - pc scales .",
    "this suggests that a substantial fraction of the total jet luminosity is carried out to large distances by the non - leptonic content of the jet .",
    "if our assumption of a magnetic field in equipartition with relativistic electrons on sub - pc scales is realistic , this would suggest that most of the kinetic power of the jet might be carried by hadrons and dissipated on pc  kpc scales , leading to the acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons in the extended jet .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with results of several other authors , suggesting that the pc - scale jets of blazars are dominated in number by electron - positron pairs , responsible for the high - energy emission produced at sup - pc scales , while the bulk of the kinetic power of the jets is carried by a relativistic hadron population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented a possible explanation for the hard vhe spectra of high - redshift @xmath1-ray blazars , when corrected for the expected amount of @xmath3 absorption by the iibr .",
    "we suggest that ultrarelativistic electrons may be accelerated on large ( kpc ) scales , where magnetic fields are so low that synchrotron cooling becomes negligible compared to compton cooling on the cmb .",
    "consequently , vhe emission from compton upscattering of the cmb by ultrarelativistic electrons may produce a separate , slowly variable vhe component beyond the rapidly variable broadband continuum from radio through gev @xmath1-ray energies that might be dominated by emission from the sub - pc scale , inner regions of the jet .",
    "as of the time of writing of this manuscript , the vhe emission of most distant tev blazars , e.g. , 1es  1101 - 232 @xcite , 1es  0229 + 200 @xcite , 1es  1011 + 496 @xcite , has not shown evidence for variability on any time scale , while the nearby tev blazars show substantial variability on time scales from years down to a few minutes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . this could indicate that cmb compton scattering constitutes an underlying non - varying vhe component in tev blazars , which would be more likely to be detected in high - redshift sources since the energy density of the cmb increases with redshift as @xmath74 .",
    "however , one has to caution that small - amplitude variability would generally be much harder to detect for the much fainter high - redshift tev sources .",
    "we have applied this idea to two simultaneous seds of 1es  1101 - 232 . although the parameters of our fits are rather poorly constrained , they seem to indicate that only a small portion of the kinetic energy of the jet is dissipated on sub - pc scales , while the bulk of this energy is transported outward to kpc scales , in agreement with earlier suggestions that the kinetic power of blazar jets might generally be dominated by their hadronic content and is only dissipated on large scales .",
    "alternative explanations for the very hard vhe emissions include compton upscattering of infrared emission from dust in the vicinity of the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or signatures of pion decay in hadronic blazar models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it should be noted that compton scattering of infrared radiation with a characteristic wavelength of @xmath75 m would also be affected by klein - nishina effects at energies of @xmath76  tev , so a photon index of @xmath26 out to multi - tev energies might be difficult to explain with this mechanism .",
    "it is also possible to produce vhe spectra of arbitrary hardness if they are affected by @xmath3 absorption intrinsic to the source through interaction with narrow - band emission from the vicinity of the agn @xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious why such a feature should be observed preferentially in high - redshift tev blazars , and why it would lead to less variable tev emission than in the low - redshift tev blazars , if the lack of variability is confirmed by future observations .",
    "our cmb - compton interpretation for the vhe emission of 1es  1101 - 232 is obviously not applicable to high - redshift vhe sources that seem to show substantial variability on time scales of days or even shorter , e.g. , 3c279 @xcite since it requires a pc - scale extent of the emission region .",
    "the interpretation of the unexpectedly hard vhe spectrum through such a scenario would predict that any emission at lower ( gev ) energies might be produced in the inner ( sub - pc ) region of the jet and be much more rapidly variable than the vhe emission . whether this is the correct interpretation for the hard spectrum of 1es  1101 - 232 or not ,",
    "a compton - scattered cmb component from blazar jet emission will accompany synchrotron emission and could potentially be observed with @xmath1-ray telescopes .",
