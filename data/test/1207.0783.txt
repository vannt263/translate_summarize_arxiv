    "biometric authentication systems allow authenticating individuals by comparing a query provided by the claimant to its biometric reference . depending on the result of this comparison ,",
    "the claimant is accepted ( the system asserts he / she owns the identity he / she claims ) or rejected ( the system does not assert he / she owns the identity he / she claims ) . usually , the biometric reference is created during the enrollment phase by providing one or several captures",
    ". however , most biometric modalities are not permanent and system performance decreases with time . to overcome this drawback , it is possible to re - enroll the user at a fixed time .",
    "sadly , this method has a high cost because it needs time and operators .",
    "enrollment period may also be on a too short timespan to collect enough intraclass variabilities to represent the user as best as possible .",
    "the aim of semi - supervised template update systems is to address these issues by automatically updating the biometric reference of individuals while they use the system .",
    "the update system only uses information from the query and from the biometric recognition system .",
    "semi - supervised template update is an active field of research mainly studied for morphological modalities , whereas they are less subject to variabilities than the behavioral ones .",
    "as such systems can include impostor s samples in the updated biometric reference , the biometric reference can progressively deviates from the owner s real biometric data and the system attracts more impostors .",
    "there are two kinds of systems in the literature , the self - update systems  @xcite and the co - update systems  @xcite .",
    "self - update systems allow unimodal system to update the reference automatically after collecting unlabelled data .",
    "their main drawback is the fact that they are not able to attract genuine samples to much dissimilar than the original reference one  @xcite , so they miss several samples during the update procedure .",
    "co - update systems allow using multimodal systems in order to attract these forgotten samples because one biometric reference is updated based on the classification result of the complementary classifier related to the other biometric reference linked to the other modality .",
    "we propose a new hybrid template update system .",
    "there are several components in a template update system .",
    "our hybrid system is not clearly based on the optimisation of one particular component .",
    "we can see it as both a modification of the way of representing the biometric reference , and the way of updating the user s gallery . a user is represented by several biometric sub - references evolving in parallel by using different template update methods .    the contributions of this work are the following ones : ( 1 ) we propose an original hybrid template update system scheme performing better than the classic self - update system from the state of the art .",
    "this is an hybrid system because ( a ) it operates fusion as in co - update systems , whereas it is a self - update system , and ( b ) user s biometric reference is composed of several biometric sub - references ; ( 2 ) we propose two metrics in order to evaluate the efficiency of template update systems over several sessions ; ( 3 ) we evaluate the method with a dataset providing more samples per user than most studies of the state of the art .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_previous_work ] gives a quick overview of the recent works on template update .",
    "section  [ sec_proposal ] presents the template update architecture we propose , as well as two new evaluation metrics .",
    "section  [ sec_protocol ] presents the selected protocol to evaluate our contribution .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] presents the experimental results and section  [ sec_conclusion ] concludes this communication .",
    "in this section , we present the most recent works in template update .",
    "bhatt  _ et al .",
    "_ present a co - update method allowing to update two related classifiers in an online way  @xcite .",
    "the svm boundary decision is updated in a semi - supervised way .",
    "namely , if a classifier returns with a high probability that a sample corresponds to a particular label , whereas the second classifier disagrees , this new sample is used for an online update of the second classifier .",
    "the authors show , on a face recognition problem , that their system improves performance both in accuracy and in computational time .",
    "the validation is done on an aggregated database of 1833 subjects providing 20150 images .",
    "there is an average of 11 images per individual , which can be considered as small for a template update study .",
    "rattani  _ et al .",
    "_ present self - update and co - update for biometric modalities where a biometric sample can be used as a biometric reference  @xcite .",
    "such kind of information can be irrelevant for some biometric modalities , like keystroke dynamics , which are not consistent enough to work with only one sample .",
    "they analyse the behavior of the updating method by representing the samples as nodes in a graph and similarities as edges between nodes .",
    "they show that the graph can contain independent sub - graphs .",
    "samples from a sub - graph can not attract samples from other sub - graphs as they are too much dissimilar .",
    "the samples present in other sub - graphs contain more variabilities but will not be used in the template update system .",
    "co - update allows attracting these samples .",
    "the study is done with 40 users providing each 50 samples ( of face and fingerprint ) on 5 sessions captured on 1.5 years .",
    "seeger and bours list various factors used to specify an evaluation scenario of a template update system for keystroke dynamics  @xcite . note that most of the results of this paper are also relevant for other modalities , and therefore this paper is worth reading .",
    "the authors show that different evaluation scenarios give different interpretation of the template update system performance .",
    "this is a problem , because almost no template update study uses the same kind of scenario and because most studies do not explain which scenario configuration has been chosen .",
    "giot _ et al . _",
    "raise some questions , without answering them , about the evaluation of template update systems  @xcite .",
    "they show that , in addition to the scenario parameters presented in  @xcite , most studies also present a great variability in the way of computing the performance of the template update system .",
    "they use three different ways encountered in the template update literature to evaluate the performance of a keystroke dynamics template update system using exactly the same set of scores .",
    "they show that different interpretations can be proposed whereas the scores are identical .",
    "these recent works assert the fact it is necessary to clearly specify the way of computing the performances , and the need of standardised evaluation procedures .",
    "this section presents the proposed template update component and associated evaluation metrics .      here are some definitions for the paper .",
    "user s gallery _ is a set of biometric samples used to represent a user , while a _ biometric reference _ is a model representing a user and has been computed with the samples of its gallery .",
    "these two different terms are both named model , biometric reference , or template in the literature .",
    "our contribution is inspired by the co - update systems  @xcite , although we use a mono - modal system , and the various works on gallery update  @xcite . in all previous works ,",
    "the biometric reference of the user is unique because a user is represented by only one gallery or one sample or one model .",
    "but in our work , the biometric reference is composite : this _ biometric meta - reference _ contains several _ biometric sub - references _ evolving with various template update methods , but authentication will be done with a unique biometric authentication method ( whereas in multibiometrics , people use a multi - algorithm scheme when only one modality is used ) . fig .",
    "[ fig_schema ] summarizes the proposed system ( green area ) for a system using two biometric sub - references per user ( _ i.e. _ , two different biometric template update systems evolve in parallel ) , and tab .",
    "[ tab_diff_methods ] presents the difference between self - update , co - update and hybrid - update .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the baseline scenario without template update is `` none '' , and the baseline scenarios with template update are the self - updates with the `` sliding '' and `` growing '' gallery management ; they correspond to previous works published in  @xcite .",
    "our new contributions in this paper are the other ones ( `` parallel sliding '' , `` parallel growing '' , `` parallel both '' , `` parallel min sliding '' , `` parallel min growing '' , `` parallel min both '' ) .    it is well known that decreasing the fnmr of a biometric system correspond to increasing the fmr ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we can observe a similar behavior , linked to the time , on fig .",
    "[ fig_fnmr_fmr ] .",
    "methods allowing decreasing the fnmr over time tend to increase the fmr over time . as the eer evolution can not give us such kind of information ( see fig .  [ fig_eer ] ) , we think that , in opposition to previous papers  @xcite , providing the eer of template update systems may be not be a good idea , and it would be better to provide the fnmr and fmr in order to see their difference of evolution .",
    "in addition , when using a double threshold mechanism , the eer threshold can be incompatible with the update threshold .    looking on the fig .",
    "[ fig_fnmr_fmr ] ( and not taking into account fig .",
    "[ fig_eer ] , even if it could assert that too ) , we see that the `` parallel both '' method is the most appropriate .",
    "it is not the best method in term of fmr nor fnmr , but it is the sole method presents in the best methods each time . as it seems to be a good compromise , we can say that using several sub - references improves performances against using only one ( `` growing '' and `` sliding '' ) . to assert this conclusion",
    ", we manually ranked each update method ( sorted by global performance ) on the following rates : fmr , fnmr , eer , fisur , gumr . for each update method ,",
    "we sumed all the ranks of the various criteria and sort them . tab .",
    "[ tab_ranks ] presents the ranking results .",
    "we have also computed the ranks without using the eer .",
    "we think we can not trust the eer values , because ( i ) it may be hard to configure the system with the thresholds allowing to obtain the eer ; ( ii ) the eer threshold may be incompatible with the one used for the update decision .",
    "although ranks are different with the two ways of computing , the two bests and two worsts methods are the same .",
    "the two best methods are _ parallel both _ and _ parallel min both _ , which is the proposed method when we evolve in parallel two biometric sub - references using the growing window and the sliding window .",
    "it shows the benefit of the proposed method when evolving different biometric sub - references .",
    "the two worst methods are _ parallel min growing _ and _ none_. it is easy to understand . in the first case ,",
    "there are two biometric sub - references : the initial reference which quickly becomes not representative and results in rejecting genuine samples and the growing window which can contains and keep a lot of impostor samples .",
    "this behavior is explained in fig .  [ fig_update_errors ] where we see that this method is the one attracting the highest number of impostors .",
    "[ fig_update_errors ] shows that , for most methods , having a higher iusr implies a lower gumr ( and vice - versa ) except for _ parallel both _ , which is never the best method , but is always in the top methods .",
    "it is the only method attracting not too many impostors and rejecting not too many genuine samples .",
    "the same behavior is observed on fig .",
    "[ fig_fnmr_fmr ] .",
    "thus , being the method having not too much fmr and not much fnmr , the eer is low in comparison to other methods .",
    "[ fig_update_errors ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_fnmr_fmr ] show that there is a strong relationship between fnmr and gumr , and fmr and iusr .",
    "this proves that to reduce the fnmr ( respectively fmr ) , it is necessary to reduce the gumr ( respectively iusr ) .",
    "there is one limit of the present evaluation procedure which is linked to the chosen update selection procedure .",
    "as we use a double threshold scheme , it is necessary to specify the two thresholds .",
    "results would be different with thresholds performing badly .",
    "this may be an issue in an operational scenario ( the optimum thresholds may be hard to obtain ) .",
    "a good practice would be to compute the threshold of a selected operational point using enrolment samples of all users , and compute the update threshold using it ( using the eer threshold computed with first session divided by 2 gives us similar results ) .",
    "we have presented a hybrid template update method allowing to update several biometric references in parallel .",
    "the parallel evolution of biometric sub - references allows reducing the update error rates and the performance decreases over time in comparison to classic methods using one reference .",
    "the method has been validated on a template update system for keystroke dynamics on two datasets .",
    "one of the datasets contains 400 samples per users which is larger than most studies from the state of the art for template update of morphological modalities .",
    "we have shown that our scheme gives better performance than the classical ones ( self - update with sliding or growing windows ) .",
    "although the method has been evaluated in an online semi - supervised scenario , it could be used in offline scenarios or supervised scenarios too .",
    "the implementation uses two sub - references , but it would be useful to analyse if using more sub - references would improve the performances",
    ". it would be interesting to validate the proposition in other contexts and other modalities ( signature for example ) , as well as with online classifiers instead of methods using a gallery and update decision methods .",
