    "what is the most broad - ranging currently active field of applied probability ?",
    "measuring breadth by the number of different academic disciplines where it appears , it seems hard to beat a field appearing in physics , computer science and electrical engineering , economics and finance , psychology and sociology , population genetics and epidemiology and ecology .",
    "curiously , the field has no good name , though readers of _ bernoulli _ will most likely know it , under the continuing influence of liggett s 1985 book  @xcite , as _ interacting particle systems_. it turns out that mathematically similar toy models of different real - world entities have been repeatedly re - invented in the different disciplines mentioned above , and literally thousands of papers have been written since 2000 on discipline - dependent variant models intended as more realistic .    rather than attempting a brief overview of the whole field as it stands today ( on which i am certainly not an expert ) , let me take an opposite approach , imagining starting with a blank slate .",
    "i  will set out in the next section a particular conceptual setting ",
    "what sorts of things are we trying to model ?  then a particular technical setup , and then indicate what sort of mathematical results one might seek .",
    "given this manifesto , the rest of the article describes some basic models , gives pointers to the existing literature and presents a few open problems suggested by our setting .",
    "the article is based on a short course given in summer 2012 at warwick and cornell , and more extensive informal material is available at @xcite .",
    "i must emphasize that the article is intended as an introduction to the topics it mentions , not as an authoritative survey , which would require ten times the length !",
    "in particular none of the mathematics outlined here is both new and non - straightforward , except perhaps some open problems .",
    "the particular setting we envisage is of the human social network . people meet or communicate , and",
    "explicitly or implicitly receive information from the other , and this interaction may change the `` state '' ( opinion or possessions or  ) of the individuals .",
    "now that sentence skips over many issues .",
    "`` information '' is a complicated concept  @xcite , and formalizing it as one of a set of prespecified states hardly captures the nuances of human experience . and obviously we receive information in many ways other than one - on - one interaction with other individuals .",
    "but the fact that humans do a lot of different things via interactions emphasizes the point that we are interested in a variety of different rules , a point that would be less visible if we took some real or hypothetical physical system as a prototype setting .",
    "social networks ( whose mathematical modeling and analysis long predates the facebook era ) are usually modeled as unweighted graphs  vertices are individuals , edges indicate some specified relationship . in most contexts",
    "it would be more realistic to use _ weighted _ graphs , the weight indicating strength of relationship .",
    "this is seldom done because of increased model complexity and the fact that the meaning of `` strength of relationship '' is context - dependent .",
    "but we will give it the specific meaning of `` frequency of meeting '' , formalized via the rates @xmath0 below .",
    "the story above suggests the following technical framework , in which randomness arises primarily via assumed random times of meetings . because the framework can be used outside the social network setting",
    ", i will use the impersonal word `` agent '' in what follows .",
    "consider @xmath1 _",
    "agents _ and a nonnegative array @xmath2 , indexed by unordered pairs @xmath3 , which is irreducible ( i.e. , the graph of edges corresponding to strictly positive entries is connected ) .",
    "assume    * each unordered pair @xmath4 of agents with @xmath5 meets at the times of a rate-@xmath0 poisson process , independent for different pairs .",
    "call this collection of poisson processes the _ meeting process_. where needed we write @xmath6 for the set of agents .",
    "now introduce a set @xmath7 of states , and consider a process @xmath8 in which each agent @xmath9 is in some state @xmath10 at time @xmath11 , and the state can only change when agent @xmath9 meets some other agent @xmath12 , at which time the two agents states are updated according to some rule ( typically deterministic , but might be random ) which depends only on the pre - meeting states @xmath13 .",
    "so in the deterministic case , there is a given arbitrary function @xmath14 and when agents in states @xmath15 and @xmath16 meet their states are updated as @xmath17 we call such a process an _ fmie ( finite markov information exchange ) process _ and emphasize that a specific such process has two levels .",
    "the meeting process is determined by the meeting rate matrix @xmath2 ( which we loosely call the `` geometry '' , imagining that we tend to meet more frequently with individuals who are `` close '' in some sense ) .",
    "the information update process is determined by some rule .",
    "then the different named fmie models we shall describe ( such as the voter model ) correspond to different rules for the informational superstructure ; we regard such models as defined over arbitrary geometries .",
    "of course much of the beauty and utility of mathematics is in providing abstractions that encompass apparently different things , and as stated at the start fmie models have been used in many disciplines .",
    "let me briefly mention three that are relevant to our models later .",
    "conceptually closest is the mathematical modeling of epidemics , whose long history is indicated by the 1957 monograph  @xcite .",
    "a typical classical model like the sir ( susceptible  infected  recovered ) model corresponds to a 3-state fmie if the relevant distributions are exponential .",
    "here of course the vertices are people or animals and the edges relate to physical proximity .",
    "classical models considered homogeneously mixing populations ( i.e. , the complete graph geometry ) but there is extensive post-2000 literature on more general geometries .    a quite different context , from theoretical computer science , concerns distributed randomized algorithms . here",
    "agents are processors , communicating with nearby ( direct connections in a network ) processors , and performing computations based on data transferred .",
    "see  @xcite for the particular topic of _ gossip algorithms_.    what are called _ interacting particle systems ( ips ) _ arose historically as statistical physics models of phenomena such as magnetism , and mathematicians became interested in particular in rigorous study of phase transitions , in the setting of infinite geometries , specifically the infinite @xmath18-dimensional lattice .",
    "this literature long ago branched out to study many `` toy models '' not so directly related to any specific physical phenomenon .",
    "our development is in the same `` toy models '' spirit , and the models naturally suggested by the social networks context partly overlap and partly differ from those naturally suggested by statistical physics . in particular , the abstraction of what we are studying as `` information flow through networks '' seems more helpful than any physical visualization .",
    "a broader but less focused view of the whole `` statistical physics of social dynamics '' topic can be found in @xcite .",
    "the concept of an _ ips _ is generally discussed via example rather than explicit definition .",
    "for instance liggett  @xcite takes as examples the voter model , contact process , exclusion process , glauber dynamics for the ising model , and the potlatch process .",
    "our mathematical setup of _ fmie process _ in section  [ sec : tech ] is intended as a more precisely circumscribed class of processes to study .",
    "for instance , only the first three processes on liggett s list are fmie ( for the contact process , add an artificial agent with rate - one meetings with each other agent , to effect recovery ) .",
    "what we call the meeting process is often called the _ graphical representation _ in ips .",
    "our emphasis on a _ finite _ number of agents gives a somewhat different perspective than in classical ips , in which the finite setting was considered only occasionally , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "our viewpoint is by analogy with the modern literature on mixing and hitting times for finite markov chains @xcite ; study how the behavior of a model depends on the underlying geometry , where `` behavior '' means quantitative aspects of finite - time behavior .",
    "more precisely , we typically study @xmath19 limits in a family of finite - agent processes , rather than @xmath20 limits in a single infinite - agent process . the averaging process studied in section  [ sec : ave ]",
    "provides a prototype for the style of results we would like to establish for a given fmie model ; see also the discussion of possible @xmath20 limits in section  [ sec : scc ] .",
    "the fmie setup allows an arbitrary update function @xmath21 at ( [ def - f ] ) and an arbitrary `` geometry '' of meeting rates @xmath2 .",
    "one can hardly hope to say anything of substance in this generality ( we will mention various `` general principles '' but these are rather trite , once said ) . at a pragmatic level , if seeking analytic results one chooses an update function such that the fmie process can be analyzed on the complete graph ( `` mean - field '' , roughly ) geometry , otherwise it will likely be difficult to handle other geometries . and",
    "obversely , one chooses a geometry in which one can analyze the two basic processes of section  [ sec:2basic ] , otherwise it will likely be difficult to handle more complicated update rules",
    ".    from our viewpoint , much of the literature since 2000 consists of inventing and investigating a large number of increasingly elaborate update rules , while considering only a small number of `` standard geometries '' , indicated below . keep in mind that it is easy to invent and simulate models , but hard to give rigorous proofs or to relate convincingly to real - world data .      here we briefly describe four of the `` standard geometries '' on which models are often studied .",
    "recall @xmath1 is the number of agents .",
    "note that in a realistic social network there is no reason why @xmath22 , which is the rate at which agent @xmath9 meets other agents , should be constant in @xmath9 . but many simple models do have this property , in which case we may rescale time to fit a _ standardization convention _ @xmath23 as in the first two examples below .    here",
    "@xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 for adjacent agents @xmath26 .",
    "the next two examples involve networks modelled as _ random _ graphs .",
    "formally this adds another level of randomness , though informally we can just think of being given a typical realization . in such ( non - regular ) graphs one",
    "typically can not satisfy ( [ standardization ] ) and instead the default convention is to take rates @xmath27 for each edge @xmath28 .",
    "here one starts with the @xmath18-dimensional discrete torus ( or similar non - random graph ) and then adds random other edges in some specified way , for instance independently with probabilities proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "there are several ways ( in particular the _ configuration model _",
    "@xcite ) to define graphs corresponding to the intuitive notion of being `` completely random '' subject to the constraint that , as @xmath19 , the distribution of vertex - degrees converges to a prescribed distribution .",
    "such models are tractable because their @xmath19 local weak limit is just a modified galton - watson tree .",
    "there is a huge `` complex networks '' literature ( see , e.g. , the monographs @xcite ) devoted to inventing and studying network models , and i will not write out a long list here . let me instead mention three other mathematically natural geometries which have _ not _ been studied as much as one might have expected ( and two more will be mentioned in section  [ sec : infinite ] ) .",
    "start with the torus @xmath30 and add rates @xmath31 for non - adjacent @xmath4 .",
    "this is a way to interpolate between the torus and the complete graph .",
    "note the distinction between this and the `` small worlds '' model , in which the rate is non - vanishing for a few random edges .    given a model",
    "whose behavior is understood on the two - dimensional lattice , one could investigate the effect of `` disorder '' by taking instead a proximity graph over a poisson process of points in the plane @xcite .",
    "this is a standard example in markov chain theory .",
    "here we discuss two fmie processes that are `` basic '' in two senses .",
    "they fit the definition of fmie process but are much simpler than ( and therefore unrepresentative of ) a typical fmie process ; yet many other fmie processes can be regarded as being built over one of these base processes , with extra structure added .    for each fmie",
    ", we give only a verbal description , which the reader can readily formalize .",

    "the natural aspect to study is @xmath32 the agent holding the token at time @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath33 is the ( continuous - time ) markov chain with transition rates @xmath2 .",
    "we call this the _ associated _ markov chain  associated with the underlying geometry .",
    "let me digress to mention , by analogy , a nuance . a google scholar search on `` exact phrase @xmath34 galton - watson ; year @xmath34 19651969 '' returns only papers studying @xmath35 population size in generation @xmath36 of a galton - watson branching process .",
    "changing to `` year @xmath34 20052009 '' , half the papers talk about the galton - watson * tree * , which of course has more structure than the population size process ",
    "one can study cousins , for instance .",
    "analogously , the token process has more structure than the associated markov chain  one can study the time until agent @xmath9 meets someone who has previously held the token , for instance .    for finite - state markov chains",
    ", we have available both a classical general theory and a long catalog of explicit calculations in specific geometries . for our purposes ,",
    "the main point is that several fmie models ( classically the voter model and the exclusion process , but also the averaging process ) have close connections with the associated markov chain , and parts of the `` standard modern theory '' @xcite of finite chains can be used in their analysis .    for readers more familiar with discrete - time chains , let me emphasize that ( because @xmath37 ) the stationary distribution of the associated chain is always uniform",

    "models of real - world epidemics are of course much more elaborate .",
    "regarding our simple pandemic model , it is analogous to the markov chain in two ways :    * there is extensive literature doing calculations in specific geometries ; i show a little in section  [ sec : pandemic ] .",
    "* several other fmies can be `` built over '' the pandemic model ",

    "the elided third item is the most general possibility for a finite - state markov chain ( applied to the configurations of a fmie process ) ; there are one or more _ strongly connected components _ ( sccs ) of the directed transition graph , and",

    "the result is essentially equivalent to the assertion @xmath267 the basic observation ( [ knk ] ) allows one to write down an explicit expression for the fourier transform of the left side , and one just needs to work through the calculus to check it converges to the fourier transform of the right side .",
    "( transform methods are of course very classical in applied probability , and their use in epidemic models goes back at least to  @xcite . )    the same transform argument ( then taking a different limit regime ) can be used to prove the following result ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) for the time @xmath268 until the entire population is infected : @xmath269 where @xmath270 are independent with gumbel distribution .",
    "while not obvious from the statement of the proposition above , it can in fact be deduced as follows . from ( [ dnun ] )",
    ", the time @xmath271 until half the population is infected satisfies @xmath272 then symmetry ( under @xmath273 ) of the transition rates ( [ knk ] ) implies that @xmath268 is essentially distributed as the sum of two independent copies of @xmath271 .",
    "reconsider the time @xmath274 until a random person is infected .",
    "proposition  [ plogistic ] implies it has asymptotic distribution @xmath275 where @xmath276 has logistic distribution function , independent of the gumbel time - shift @xmath263 .",
    "so we expect @xmath277 now @xmath278 by symmetry ( @xmath279 ) and one can calculate ( or look up ) that @xmath280 euler s constant , so the limit theorem is consistent with the exact formula ( [ euler ] ) .",
    "the extent to which different aspects of the `` mean - field '' behavior in section  [ sec : fpp_complete ] extend to more general geometries is not well understood . for the `` random graphs with prescribed degree distributions '' ( with appropriate moments finite ) geometry , one expects to see qualitatively similar behavior ( the pandemic phase to have duration @xmath281 , centered at time @xmath282 ) , and almost precise analogs",
    "have indeed been proved ",
    "e.g. ,  @xcite , theorem  3.1(b ) gives the analog of ( [ dgl ] ) .",
    "there has been extensive subsequent work on related problems and related `` locally tree - like '' geometries , but these proofs are substantially more technical than for the complete graph . and even on the hamming cube @xmath283 the behavior of fpp is not well understood  @xcite .",
    "to think about possible `` general theory '' , let me suggest a loose analogy with the established theory of random walk on infinite graphs  @xcite . in that theory ,",
    "most geometries fall into one of two categories , exemplified by @xmath162 and @xmath18-trees , according to whether @xmath284 properties involving spectral radius , isoperimetric inequalities , amenability , ( sub)linear rate of escape can then be related to this categorization .",
    "that theory formalizes a distinction ( informally , between `` finite dimensional '' and `` infinite dimensional '' ) from the random walk viewpoint .",
    "so by analogy , we have seen that the finite pandemic process behaves differently on @xmath30 and on the complete graph .",
    "can we select one specific aspect of the different behavior as a useful basis for classifying geometries ?",
    "write @xmath285 .",
    "one obvious distinction between these two geometries is that on @xmath30 the means @xmath286 vary ( depending on distance between @xmath9 and @xmath12 ) but on the complete graph , the @xmath286 are the same ( to first order ) for most pairs @xmath28 .",
    "so we can define a property ( for a sequence of weighted graphs @xmath2 ) which combines the idea of the wlln ( [ conj-1 ] ) with the idea of the @xmath286 not varying much : @xmath287 this property ( which holds for the `` random graphs with prescribed degree distribution '' geometry  @xcite ) is an attempt to formalize the notion of a geometry being `` locally infinite - dimensional '' from the fpp viewpoint .",
    "study equivalences between this property and the `` geometry '' of @xmath2 .    two brief comments .",
    "we ca nt hope to establish ( [ conj - infdim ] ) using only isoperimetric inequalities  they can only give order of magnitude .    there is a loose analogy with the cutoff phenomenon in finite markov chains  @xcite , in that we expect the property to hold in `` highly symmetric '' geometries .",
    "but that analogy is discouraging in that there is no useful general condition for cut - off .",
    "consider the geometry @xmath58 with agents @xmath171 and meeting rates    at rate @xmath117 an agent meets a uniform random neighbor ;    at rate @xmath288 an agent meets a uniform non - neighbor .    here",
    "over this range the geometry qualitatively interpolates between the complete - graph case and the nearest - neighbor lattice case .",
    "so we expect the center of the pandemic window to interpolate between orders @xmath290 and @xmath141 , and the width of the pandemic window to interpolate between orders @xmath117 and @xmath141 .    for the pandemic model over this geometry",
    ", it turns out that an analog of the `` randomly - shifted logistic limit '' holds , albeit with a different deterministic function @xmath21 in place of the logistic , and different scaling .",
    "this is rather counter - intuitive  we envisage infectives as growing patches of mold in a petri dish , one might expect the detailed geometry of overlaps to play a role .",
    "but the key qualitative property is that , during the pandemic phase , the new infectives arise from `` colonies '' started earlier in the pandemic phase , not in the initial phase .",
    "this enables us to derive the following equation for the standardized function @xmath21 describing proportion of infectives r over the pandemic window : @xmath291 see  @xcite for heuristics and  @xcite for careful treatment of a closely related model .",
    "there is a large literature modeling spread of opinions , adoption of innovations etc via social networks , and some of the models fit our fmie setting .",
    "instead of describing some standard model let me describe two new fmie models suggested by the `` social networks '' context .",
    "mathematically they are variants of pandemic , and we will see in sections  [ sec : deference][sec : fashionista ] that on the complete graph their behavior can be derived from the precise understanding of pandemic given by proposition  [ plogistic ] .      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the agents are labelled @xmath117 through @xmath1 , and agent @xmath9 initially has opinion @xmath9 . when two agents meet , they adopt the same opinion , the smaller of the two opinion - labels . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    clearly opinion 1 spreads as pandemic , so the `` ultimate '' behavior of deference is not a new question .",
    "we will consider the complete graph geometry , and study @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the proportion of the population with opinion @xmath131 at time @xmath11 .",
    "we can rewrite proposition  [ plogistic ] as @xmath294 where @xmath21 is the logistic function and @xmath295 , where @xmath296 arises as the limit r.v .",
    "( [ yule_lim ] ) associated with the yule process .",
    "the key insight is that opinions @xmath117 and @xmath297 and  and @xmath131 combined behave as one infection in pandemic , except for a different initial phase , and so the sum @xmath298 behaves as in ( [ xkf ] ) but with a different random shift @xmath299 . because the initial phase is just a collection of @xmath131 independent yule processes",
