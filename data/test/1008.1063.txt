    "most of the games represent simplified real - life situations and help us to find an optimum decision ( action ) . due to the simplifications the players have only a few options to choose and the corresponding incomes are quantified by a payoff matrix allowing us to apply the tools of mathematics .",
    "the theory of games has been used successfully both in economics and political decisions since the pioneering work of von neumann and morgenstern @xcite .",
    "subsequently the concept of payoff matrix is adopted by biologists to quantify the effect of interactions of species on their fitness ( characterizing the capability to create offspring ) in the mathematical models of darwinian evolution @xcite . since that time the evolutionary game theory provides a general mathematical framework for the investigation of multi - agent systems used widely in economy and other social sciences where imitation is substituted for the offspring creation @xcite .    in traditional game theory",
    "selfish and intelligent individuals try to maximize their own payoff irrespective of others . in evolutionary game theory players repeat the games and sometimes imitate ( adopt ) the neighbor s strategy if the neighbor received a higher score .",
    "it turned out that assuming local interactions among players the imitation supports the maintenance of altruistic behavior even for prisoner s dilemma games where the individual interest is in conflict with the common one and the selfish individual behavior drives the well - mixed community into a state ( called `` tragedy of the commons '' ) with players exploiting ( instead of helping ) each other @xcite .    in parallel with theoretical investigations game theory",
    "is also used to study human and animal behaviors experimentally @xcite .",
    "these experiments have motivated the extension of evolutionary games to study the effect of different types of mutual help , e.g. , charity @xcite , inequality ( inequity ) aversion @xcite , emotions @xcite including juvenile - adult interactions @xcite .",
    "in generally , the modelling of human decision dynamics is one of the most important open problems in the behavioral sciences @xcite . the examples mentioned raise the possibility that a player tries to optimize not only personal but her local neighborhood s payoff as well .",
    "motivated by this option we consider the simplest case and introduce a collective pairwise strategy update rule providing that two randomly chosen neighbors upgrade their strategy simultaneously in order to increase their summarized payoff each coming from games with all their neighbors on the spatial system .",
    "this way of strategy update can be considered as an extension of cooperative games toward the spatial evolutionary games .",
    "originally , in cooperative games groups of players ( coalitions ) may perform coordinated behavior within the group to enhance the group s payoff . on the other hand ,",
    "the present model implies a connection between the theory of kin selection @xcite and spatial models of viscous population of altruistic relatives helping each other @xcite .    as a consequence of the proposed strategy update rule",
    ", it will be shown that the previously mentioned  tragedy of the commons  state can be avoided even in the hard condition of prisoner s dilemma game . in the latter case",

    "this means that an anti - ferromagnetic ordering process is expected for the ac games with myopic strategy update when decreasing the noise parameter @xmath35 .",
    "motivated by the above mentioned connection to the ising model , we first consider the anti - coordination game and study the consequences of different strategy update rules .",
    "the presented results of mc simulations were obtained typically for @xmath39 size but we used significantly larger system size in the vicinity of the critical transitions to suppress undesired fluctuations . during the evolution",

    "in fact two equivalent types of completely ordered structure exist in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "for both cases the @xmath1 and @xmath2 strategies are present with the same frequency ( @xmath44 ) . in the first ( second ) case",

    "[ fig : ising ] .",
    "when considering the analogy between the kinetic ising spin systems and evolutionary ac games one should keep in mind that the glauber dynamics @xcite favors spin flips decreasing the total energy and the opposite flips are generated by the external noise ( temperature ) . on the contrary , for the evolutionary games the myopic individuals wish to increase their own payoff and the opposite decision is caused by noisy effects .",
    "the necessity of the temperature rescaling is related to the fact that in the kinetic ising model for glauber dynamics the individual spin flips are controlled by the total energy difference while for the evolutionary games the changes are influenced by the individual payoff increase ( @xmath52 ) that is half of the total payoff increase ( if the payoff matrix is symmetric ) because the co - players share the income equally .    in the following",

    "figure  [ fig : ising ] indicates a striking qualitative similarity between the behaviors controlled by the myopic and pairwise collective strategy updates .",
    "the slight difference between the outputs is related to the fact how payoffs change due to different update processes .",
    "as we already mentioned , the change of individual payoff is half of the global change for myopic rule .",
    "this is not necessarily true for pairwise collective rule because neighboring players receive nothing from the game played between the focal @xmath22 and @xmath26 players . in a special case ,",
    "when focal players adopt each others strategies simultaneously , the exact relation between the changes of individual and global payoffs is restored .",
    "this special process , when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , resembles the kawasaki spin - exchange of statistical mechanics . as a consequence , this `` limited '' pairwise collective dynamics reproduces the results of myopic update .    to close this section",
    ", we should stress that the application of the third type pairwise imitation strategy update is unable to find the optimal solution when cooperator and defector players form a long - range ordered state . in the following we will study the consequences of different updating rules when the payoff matrix is not symmetric .",
    "we start with a simple and popular parametrization of the weak pd game when ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "if we fix the noise level , the only free parameter is the @xmath15 temptation to defect payoff element . in the rest of the paper we use @xmath56 noise value , that is proved to offer an almost optimal cooperation level in case of pairwise imitation strategy update model @xcite .",

    "a frozen state is analogous to a nash equilibrium in the sense that the unilateral deviation from this strategy profile would reduce the income of the given player .",
    "as we demonstrated , a frozen state , that is the composition of two types of ( equivalent ) small ordered domains , can be avoided by applying the first rule because irrational strategy change along the interfaces helps to find global optimum .",

    "the speed ( pre - factor @xmath102 ) of ordering decreases fast with the noise level @xmath35 because the disadvantageous strategy updates become rarer and rarer for sufficiently low values of noise . in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath35 approaches its critical value @xmath103 dependent on the payoff parameters ( ordering exists only if @xmath104 ) , the domain growth also slows down due to the diverging fluctuations . in the quantitative comparison of domain growth for different dynamical rules",
    "the mentioned effects are compensated by doubling the value of @xmath35 for the pairwise collective strategy update plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : ut ] and [ fig : uta ] .",
    "surprisingly , for the latter dynamical rules the blocking of the disadvantageous strategy adoptions makes the domain growth faster ( this phenomenon might have been related to the reduced noise effects along the interfaces ) .",
    "finally we mention that the preliminary simulations have confirmed the appearance of sublattice ordering for the models with nearest- and next - nearest interactions .",
    "more precisely , in the latter case one can observe a four - sublattice ordering process with many different types of ordered structures resembling those periodic structures described by a two - dimensional ising model with first- and second - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "the poly - domain versions of most of these ordered structures were reported previously by several authors who studied the evolutionary hd games with a myopic strategy update when prohibiting the acceptance of those strategies yielding a lower individual payoff @xcite . we have checked what happens if the present myopic evolutionary rule [ given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : myop ] ) ] is applied only if @xmath105 . in the latter case",
    "the domain growing process is also blocked in a ( frozen ) poly - domain state as it is described above .",
    "in this work we have introduced a pairwise collective strategy update and studied its impact on anti - coordination and social dilemma games .",
    "our proposal was motivated by real - life experiences when players act to increase not only personal but their local neighborhoods payoff , too . as a starting effort along this avenue",
    "we have chosen pairs of players . to identify and quantify the consequence of this strategy update , we have also studied two frequently applied strategy updates , such as myopic and pairwise imitation .",
    "our results highlight the emergence of a spatially ordered distribution of strategies on the analogy to anti - ferromagnetic ordering in spin systems . in contrary to the traditional imitations both the myopic and pairwise collective strategy updates support the formation of ordered strategy distribution favored within a wide range of social dilemmas .",
    "this ordered arrangement of cooperators and defectors can provide the maximum total payoff in a wide range of payoff parameters for the social dilemmas and it seems to be a general behavior on regular networks characterizing connections between the players . within the context of social sciences the appearance of mentioned state can be interpreted as a possibility for the community to avoid the `` tragedy of the common '' ( when all the agents choose @xmath2 and receive nothing ) by sharing the two possible roles ( strategies ) with a spatially ordered ( rigid ) structure .",
    "the systematic comparison of the level of cooperations ( @xmath40 ) for the three different evolutionary rules has justified that the pairwise collective strategy update provides the highest total ( average ) income for the whole spatial community in most of the region of payoff parameters .",
    "we have also studied the kinetics of ordering and found further similarities with physics motivated systems .",
    "this investigation highlighted the importance of irrational decisions as a way to avoid trapped ( frozen ) states .",
    "there are two main directions to extend the present work .",
    "firstly , as we already noted , other type of interaction graphs can also be considered .",
    "our preliminary results confirm that the positive impact of the pairwise collective strategy update is not restricted to square lattice with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "a similar ordering can emerge locally for a wide range of interaction graphs .",
    "secondly , the size of the group in which players favor the group interest ( instead of personal payoff ) can be also increased . in this case",
    "further improvement of cooperation is expected ."
