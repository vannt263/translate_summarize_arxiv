    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that not all pixels were observed the same number of times .",
    "the evident symmetrical pattern present in figure [ psigma_map ] is due to the scanning strategy of the wmap satellite .     at @xmath82 resolution for four different choices of @xmath23 as indicated in the panels , from the wmap5 w1 coadded channel .",
    "[ psigma12],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in particular , equations  ( [ xiintuit ] ) and ( [ wiintuit ] ) show that the clustering of pixels separated by @xmath23 depends on the joint distribution of @xmath93 given @xmath23 .",

    "the histogram in figure  [ pdobs ] shows the distribution of temperature in the data , for the w1 coadded channel . for homogeneous noise , the predicted distribution",
    "would be given by convolving the expected signal ( in this case gaussian with variance determined by smoothing the best - fit power spectrum on the scale of a pixel ) with that of the noise ( gaussian with average rms @xmath38 ) .",
    "for inhomogeneous noise , the predicted distribution ( i.e. equation  [ pd ] ) is given by convolving the expected gaussian signal with the noise of rms @xmath97 , and then weighting by the distribution of @xmath97 shown in figure  [ psigma_hist ] .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ pdobs ] shows a gaussian with the same rms as the data .",
    "this fit has shorter tails than the data .",
    "while this may be indicating that the signal is non - gaussian ( in fact , the sample skewness of the temperature distribution is @xmath98 mk@xmath99 , and the sample excess kurtosis 0.12698 mk@xmath100 ) , the solid curve in figure [ pdobs ] shows the predicted distribution when inhomogeneous noise effects are included : it provides substantially better agreement with the measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the one - point distribution itself can not rule out a priori the presence of a non - gaussian signal , for reasons made explicit in fang & pando ( 1997 ) ; hence it is not a suitable statistics to investigate departures from gaussianity .",
    "this is also relevant for the detection of non - gaussianity claimed by jeong & smoot ( 2007 ) , where the one - point distribution was used .",

    "points are measurements from the data .",

    "different temperature thresholds are considered , as explained in the main text.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]                  the number density of pixels above ( below ) a given temperature threshold is simply obtained by multiplying the fraction of pixels above ( below ) the threshold @xmath101 ( eq . [ fdt ] ) by the total number density after masking ( i.e. the total number of pixels after masking over the `` available '' or `` unmasked '' area ) . if the noise were homogeneous , then this prediction is rather straightforward : equation ( [ fdt ] ) simply reduces to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . in practice , due to the inhomogeneity of the noise , one needs to integrate ( [ fdt ] ) numerically , using the distributions @xmath104 measured from the data ( figure [ psigma_hist ] ) .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ number_density_512 ] are the results of this integration , when accounting for inhomogeneous noise .",
    "dotted lines are the theoretical predictions which assume homogeneous noise .",
    "points in figure [ number_density_512 ] show measurements from the wmap5 w1 channel , for pixels above or below a threshold , where @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "errorbars are from a poisson analysis .",
    "while the solid lines slightly improve the fits , significant departures still remain , especially at higher thresholds .",
    "we have measured the correlation function of pixels above and below a threshold temperature from the wmap five - year coadded maps , for a range of thresholds . in each case , we measured the signal in two ways : one in which all pixels are treated equally , and another in which the pixels are weighted by their temperature .",
    "we adopt here the standard estimator @xmath106 for the correlation function ( jensen & szalay 1986 ) , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the number of data and random pairs , respectively .",
    "in particular , the number of random pairs is computed by distributing random points on a unit sphere , and then by applying the same procedures ( i.e. kq75 masking and healpix coordinate assignment ) as for the data pipeline . for the weighted correlation estimates , the number of data pairs , @xmath107 ,",
    "is simply replaced by its temperature weighted counterpart , @xmath109 .",
    "we also tested the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) and the hamilton ( 1993 ) estimators , and found no significant differences in the calculations .",
    "figures  [ xihi ] and  [ wihi ] show an example of the results for pixels with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . in all panels ,",
    "symbols show the measurements of hot and cold pixels at the fixed threshold ; errors are from a poisson analysis .",
    "dotted curves in all the left panels show the results based on homogeneous noise , solid curves in all the right panels account for the fact that the noise is inhomogeneous ( equations  [ xitheta ] and  [ wtheta ] ) .",
    "shaded areas are derived as explained in appendix a ( see also hernndez - monteagudo et al .",
    "2004 ) , and represent the @xmath116 optimal variance errors .",
    "accounting for inhomogeneity significantly improves the fit to the data .",
    "however , discrepancies between the observed correlation functions and the theoretical predictions still remain , especially for pixels at higher thresholds , or at small angular scales . in particular , we note the interesting fact that hot and cold pixels cluster differently within the same temperature thresholds .",
    "this feature is also present in all the other wmap5 channels ( see appendix b ) , but we find that our theory is always in good agreement with the clustering of cold pixels in the q and v frequency bands , and only in slight disagreement with the hot patch clustering , especially for pixels at higher thresholds",
    ". moreover , the fact that the wmap5 data appear to be systematically stronger ( weaker ) at small ( large ) angular scales than the theoretical predictions , even at lower temperature thresholds ( figures [ xihi ] and [ wihi ] ) , is particularly true in the w channel ( see figure [ cf_512_nu_0.25_0.75_app ] for comparison ) .",
    "we suggest some possible interpretations in the discussion section and in appendix b , and present a more detailed investigation of this effect using realistic non - gaussian mock simulations in a forthcoming paper .",
    "while the detected trend may be a unique signature of primordial non - gaussianity ( i.e. a primordial non - gaussianity would in fact enhance the clustering of the cold pixels and reduce that of the hot ones ) , we study the effect of smoothing the map next , and provide some other plausible explanations for these anomalies in the final section .",
    "we have investigated the effect of smoothing the wmap five - year maps with a gaussian beam . in particular , we have tried different smoothing scales , corresponding to a fwhm of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . we have repeated the same analysis as for the unsmoothed maps , and characterized the number density and the clustering statistics of pixels above threshold .",
    "figure [ number_density_512_smooth ] summarizes the results for the number density ( w1 channel ) , after smoothing with different gaussian beams .",
    "the number of pixels above or below the considered temperature threshold is reduced ( a function of the smoothing scale ) , and measurements from the data and theoretical predictions appear now in agreement within about @xmath116 at the threshold levels considered .        finally , we have characterized the clustering statistics and showed in figure [ clustering_smooth_512 ] the case of inhomogeneous noise , for an arbitrary choice of the threshold ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the gaussian smoothing is included in our theory via equations ( [ ctheta_eq ] ) and ( [ ctheta_noise ] ) , in addition to the change of the noise variance distribution . after smoothing the map with a gaussian beam",
    ", the pixel noise may be no longer independent among different pixels ( i.e. @xmath122 ) .",
    "however , accounting for this contribution ( equation [ n1n2_cov ] ) resulted in no significant difference , even at small angular scales .",
    "in fact , the average variance of the noise in the w1 channel is 0.0213 mk@xmath123 , which is about 0.32@xmath124 of the typical variance of the corresponding cosmological signal .",
    "since the zero - level amplitude of the noise is already very low with respect to that of the signal , the mean amplitude of the correlated noise will be also very low .",
    "in addition to that , note that the wmap mission has been designed to have uncorrelated pixel noise , and if such correlations arise when smoothing the maps , their amplitude is expected to drop quickly with the smoothing scale .    when the smoothing scale is @xmath120 , we find that the tension between data and theory is alleviated .",
    "the observed distribution of temperatures in wmap5 pixels is slightly non - gaussian ( figure  [ pdobs ] ) .",
    "this departure from gaussianity is not unexpected if the intrinsic signal is gaussian but the noise distribution is inhomogeneous white noise ( figures  [ psigma_map ] and [ psigma_hist ] ) . in fact , when accounting for inhomogeneous noise ( section [ noise_model ] ) , we find that the one - point statistics is substantially in better agreement with the measurements . however , the predicted dependence of clustering on pixel height is not in good agreement with the data , even after accounting for the inhomogeneity of the noise ( figures [ xihi ] , [ wihi ] ) .",
    "although we found that an appropriate smoothing scale would be able to alleviate the discrepancy between data and measurements ( figures [ number_density_512_smooth ] and [ clustering_smooth_512 ] ) , other possible reasons for these discrepancies are : + _ masking procedure_. in our analysis we adopted the kq75 mask , which allows for selective exclusions of bright portions of the sky ( @xmath125 pixel cut ) .",
    "although this is rather a drastic cut and the mask was significantly improved with the wmap five - year data release ( hill et al .",
    "2008 ) , it may not completely account for all the galactic foreground effects . however , cutting out all the galactic plane ( @xmath126 strip ) and repeating our analysis resulted in no significant change .",
    "edge effects due to pixels which lie very close to the mask could also affect our analysis .",
    "+ _ cold spot contamination_. inoue & silk ( 2007 ) suggest that the presence of low density regions in the southern galactic cap could account for our anomalies , but restricting our analysis to @xmath127 , the northern galactic cap , resulted in no significant change . + _",
    "contamination by point sources_. lopez - caniego et al .",
    "( 2007 ) detected 98 new sources ( i.e. @xmath128 ) not present in the wmap three - year catalog . at higher frequencies",
    "wmap estimates neglect the deviations of the point spread function from a gaussian shape , and carry out a blind search for sources . with the wmap five - year data release , the mask for point sources has been significantly improved ( wright et al .",
    "2008 ) , and other studies ( gonzalez - nuevo et al .",
    "2008 ; chen & wright 2008 ) updated the point source catalog .",
    "however , massardi et al . (",
    "2008 ) recently provided a new version of the catalog based on wmap5 data and found new point sources ( 484 sources detected ) , carrying a complementary blind and non - blind approach .",
    "this may be important to our analysis , since even a very low level contamination in the maps can produce spurious non - gaussianities .",
    "in fact , we find some discrepancies at small angular scales ( around 20 ) especially in the w band , and their origin may be associated with extragalactic dust emission ( one type of point - source contamination ) , which peaks at high frequencies . in a forthcoming study",

    "+ _ foreground subtraction contamination_. uncertainties in the external foreground template model used for the foreground subtractions ( gold et al .",
    "2008 ) may introduce anomalies at the percentage level .",
    "the template itself has noise , which may be correlated at small separations .",
    "this is a delicate issue , since galactic foregrounds are non - gaussian and anisotropic , and even low level contamination in the maps can produce detectable non - gaussianities ( park et al . 2002 ; naselsky et al .",
    "2005 ; kim , naselsky & christensen 2008 ) . on the other side ,",
    "it is also worth noticing that recently vio & andreani ( 2008 ) showed that the benefits of using more sophisticated methods for foreground cleaning , such as the harmonic internal linear combination , are overestimated .",
    "we are also addressing the foreground subtraction systematics in a forthcoming study .",
    "+ _ wmap beam , window function , absolute calibration and pixel - noise uncertainties_. window functions were computed from the symmetrized beam profiles following the hermite method in page et al .",
    "a typical wmap window function has an uncertainty of @xmath129 ( hill et al .",
    "2008 ) , and these uncertainties add in quadrature in the cosmological analysis .",
    "absolute calibration uncertainties in the five - year wmap data are estimated to be @xmath130 ( hinshaw et al .",
    "recent studies ( groeneboom et al . 2009 ; kathrine wehus et al .",
    "2009 ) have also pointed out that the noise levels of these maps are underestimated , and that there are some problems with the standard wmap transfer functions as well .",
    "it may be that these facts play an important rule in our study ( see also colombo et al .",
    "+ _ secondary anisotropies and phase transitions in the early universe_. spurious non - gaussianities could arise from secondary anisotropies , such as gravitational lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich effect or sachs - wolfe effects ( babich & pierpaoli 2008 ; carbone et al .",
    "phase transitions in the early universe may also introduce a new source of non - gaussianity ( silvestri & trodden 2008 ) .",
    "all these effects may be difficult to disentangle from a pure primordial non - gaussian signal , even after a clear detection of primordial non - gaussianity . _ real non - gaussian signatures at small scales_. a better understanding of all the previous points",
    "is necessary before we can claim that the signal we see is due to primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "however , we found an interesting difference in the clustering of hot and cold pixels within the same temperature threshold level ; this fact may be a unique signature of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "we present a detailed investigation of this feature in a forthcoming study .",
    "we finally note that , as this work was being refereed , hou et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented a frequentist analysis of the correlation functions of the local extrema , and also found inconsistency with gaussian simulations plus differences in the clustering of hot and cold peaks  although comparison with their work is not direct since they considered bigger angular scales .",
    "while seeking for primordial non - gaussianity is at the moment a new frontier in cosmology , ongoing efforts are currently devoted to the characterization of non - gaussian confusion effects , to reliable theoretical predictions of non - gaussianity from models ( see for example boyle & steinhardt 2008 ; fergusson & shellard 2008 ; munshi & heavens 2009 ) , till the extraction of information from data ( i.e. raeth et al . 2008 ; gong et al .",
    "2009 ) or the search for observational signatures of primordial non - gaussianity imprinted in the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "even a small degree of primordial non - gaussianity can be a crucial probe of the inflationary dynamics or alternative universe models , hence studies of non - gaussianity may eventually become a powerful and solid probe of ultra - high energy physics and inflation .",
    "we note that our model for the effects of inhomogeneous noise may be useful in other studies ( see for instance yu & lu 2008 ) . extending our formalism for inhomogeneous noise to peak rather than pixel statistics ( for example heavens & sheth 1999 ; heavens & gupta 2001 ) is more complicated ; this will complement numerical monte - carlo analyses of this problem ( larson & wandelt 2004 ; tojeiro et al . 2006 ; ayaita et al .",
