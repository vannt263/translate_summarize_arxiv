    "* crowther et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "one phenomenon common to all these stars is x - ray emission , which affects the ionization structure in the photosphere , hence changing the observed mass - loss rate .",
    "classical cepheids also display x - ray emission that is correlated with pulsation ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "for the most part , evidence for pulsation - driven mass loss is the inability for other driving mechanisms to explain observed mass - loss rates , even in lbv and agb stars .",
    "an ideal observation connecting pulsation and mass loss would be variations of p  cygni profiles in cepheids and agb stars .",
    "in hot stars , other observations are necessary to confirm pulsation - driven mass loss since p  cygni profiles measure mass - loss rates from radiative line driving .",

    "for instance , the theory of radiative - line driven winds is general ( ( * ? ? ? * castor et al 1975 ) ) and can be applied to all stars ; that theory is only limited to hot stars because of how it depends on the ionization structure of the photosphere .",
    "the one distinct challenge for developing a general theory for pulsation - driven mass loss is , in most cases , pulsation is not the sole driving mechanism . in hot stars",
