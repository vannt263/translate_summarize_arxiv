    "when studying mechanical systems , a hamiltonian formulation of problems is often advantageous , since equations of motion can be easily obtained from a scalar function @xmath0 representing the total energy of the system .",

    "we deal with the case where the phase space is an euclidean space @xmath1 with the coordinates being the generalized positions @xmath2 and momenta @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the number of the system s degrees of freedom . except for a few special cases , where the solution of the equations of motion can be written in a closed analytic form",
    ", the system s trajectories in phase space must be approximated by numerical means .",
    "due to their excellent performance , especially over long integration times , the so - called symplectic integration techniques are of particular interest for the numerical integration of hamiltonian systems .",
    "numerical integration algorithms showing symplectic properties can be traced back to isaac newton s ` principia mathematica ' ( 1687 ) @xcite .",
    "the main reason why symplectic integrators ( sis ) have become so popular over the past decades lies in the fact that they offer remarkable long - term energy conservation .",
    "in fact , the local error in the system s total energy does not grow with time as is the case for most non - symplectic methods ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the underlying reasons for the excellent performance of symplectic integrators in this respect were understood only in the late @xmath6 century ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recently , it was shown that sis are also highly efficient in the integration of the variational equations needed for the computation of chaos indicators like the maximum lyapunov characteristic exponent ( mlce ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the smaller ( sali ) @xcite and generalized alignment index ( gali ) @xcite when using the so - called ` tangent map ' method @xcite . due to these benefits ,",
    "sis have become a standard technique in hamiltonian dynamics with particular importance in long - term integrations of multidimensional systems .    in cases",
    "where the hamiltonian @xmath0 can be separated in two parts @xmath7 , which offer individually integrable state transition maps , various symplectic integrators have been developed over the past years . for an overview see @xcite and references therein . however , in many physical problems the hamiltonian can not be split in merely two separable parts . in this paper",
    "we focus on general hamiltonian systems that can be split in exactly three integrable parts .",
    "we will show how high order symplectic integration methods for these kinds of systems can be constructed . using two different hamiltonians as examples",
    ", we will compare triple split methods with respect to their computational efficiency and energy conservation .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : si ] we give a brief introduction to the theory of sis . in section [ sec:3part ]",
    "we present a systematic way to construct high order sis for three part hamiltonian systems .",
    "we apply these methods and compare their efficiency using a toy model ( section [ sec : toy ] ) as well as the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( section [ sec : dnls ] ) as showcases . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results .",
    "finding and solving the equations of motion for dynamical systems can be greatly simplified , when a description in a hamiltonian framework is possible . given a twice continuously differentiable function @xmath8 which represents the total mechanical energy of a system , the equations of motion simply derive from @xmath9 and @xmath10 represents the vector of generalized coordinates and momenta .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is the @xmath5-dimensional identity matrix , and @xmath12 the @xmath13 matrix with all its elements equal to zero , with @xmath5 being the number of degrees of freedom of the dynamical system .",
    "differential equations derived from hamiltonian systems possess a special geometric quality related to the matrix @xmath14 - they are ` symplectic ' .",
    "to be more precise , the continuous flow of the system , i.e.  the continuous function @xmath15 , which maps initial conditions into system states at time @xmath16 , keeps the symplectic geometric structure @xmath14 intact ( for a proof see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in analogy , discrete integration algorithms that conserve @xmath14 are called ` symplectic ' as well .",
    "let us consider the example of the so - called ` symplectic euler ' integration method applied to the well known harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the flow map @xmath19 , which is the action of the lie group @xmath20 on the plane @xmath21 , is approximated by the symplectic euler scheme @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the integration time step .",
    "the numerical integration method is explicit and it is defined by the state transition matrix @xmath24 @xmath25 a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath26 which means that @xmath24 preserves @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the integration method presented in equations ( [ eq : syeul ] ) is indeed symplectic .",
    "there are many possible ways of constructing symplectic integrators , but operator splitting is one of the most transparent concepts .",
    "we slightly reformulate hamilton s equations of motion ( [ eq : ham ] ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a differential operator and @xmath29 is the poisson bracket . ] .",
    "note that the symplectic structure is now contained implicitly in the poisson bracket .",
    "the formal solution of differential equations ( [ eq : lie ] ) reads @xmath30 if the hamiltonian can be written as a sum of functions , e.g. @xmath31 , the bilinearity of the poisson bracket allows us to rewrite equation ( [ eq : exp ] ) @xmath32 the combined map @xmath33 , @xmath34 usually does not permit an analytic solution , but the individual exponential maps @xmath35 might . in the case of @xmath36 the operator splitting is then executed as follows @xmath37 in our example , analytic solutions can indeed be found for the individual maps , since @xmath38 depends only on the generalized momenta @xmath39 , representing e.g.  the total kinetic energy of the system .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 is a pure function of the generalized coordinates , e.g.  the potential energy .",
    "such an approach is suitable for creating explicit integration algorithms of first order in @xmath23 . for higher order integrators that permit larger time steps we will have to take a more careful look at the approximation in equation ( [ eq : split ] ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that the operator splitting produces error terms of higher order in @xmath23 due to the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) relation @xcite @xmath41+\\frac{\\tau^3}{12}([l_a,[l_a , l_b]]-[l_b,[l_a , l_b]])+\\hdots},\\label{eq : bch } \\end{tiny}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] denote commutators for the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i.e.  @xmath45=l_al_b - l_bl_a$ ] .",
    "this representation has lead @xcite to the conclusion that , in fact , not the intended system , but a dynamical system close to the original one is solved exactly by the split maps .",
    "for example it is easy to see that for the harmonic oscillator , the corresponding symplectic euler map @xmath46{c }      q_{\\tau } \\\\",
    "p_{\\tau } \\end{array } \\right)=\\left ( \\begin{array}[h]{cc }      1 & \\tau \\\\",
    "-\\tau & 1-\\tau^2 \\end{array } \\right)\\left ( \\begin{array}[h]{c }      q_0\\\\      p_0 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] leaves the ellipse @xmath47 invariant and thus it preserves exactly a perturbed energy .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : bch ] ) , the difference between the original and the nearby system is a polynomial in @xmath23 with the commutators of the split operators as coefficients . while the exact solution of a nearby dynamical system explains the bounded local error in energy , equation ( [ eq : bch ] )",
    "also contains the reason why variable time stepping destroys the favorable energy conservation properties of symplectic algorithms . changing the time step means changing",
    "the analytically solved nearby hamiltonian continuously .",
    "consequently , the advantage of solving a system which stays in the vicinity of the original one is lost .",
    "the standard procedure of constructing methods of higher order @xmath48 usually consists of trying to find numerical coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so that a sequence of split maps eliminates consecutive terms of the bch expansion @xmath51 see for instance @xcite . the well - known leap - frog ( aka strmer / verlet ) method of order two is obtained in this way by setting @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that it is not possible to construct integrators of order @xmath54 having only positive steps . since negative steps limit the stability of the algorithm , it is tempting to circumvent this problem .",
    "for the special case of nearly integrable systems of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 very efficient symplectic integrators with only positive steps can be constructed , as is shown in @xcite .",
    "let us now consider general hamiltonians that can be split in three parts @xmath57 , where each of the maps @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 has an analytic solution .",
    "then the construction of a symplectic integration method can be achieved as follows @xmath61 the simplest integration scheme is of first order and is just the concatenation @xmath62 . in composition with its adjoint method ( which is also symplectic )",
    "this yields already a time - reversible scheme of order two , which we will call @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 this integrator has already been applied for the numerical study of astronomical problems @xcite .",
    "some sporadic attempts to construct higher order three part split sis for specific dynamical systems have also been performed .",
    "advanced methods , for instance , especially designed for molecular dynamics are given in @xcite , while optimized algorithms for highly accurate long - term integration of astronomical problems are presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , an attempt to systematically construct high order three part sis was carried out in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "several sis were presented for the integration of a hamiltonian system that splits in three integrable parts .",
    "in addition , the performance of these numerical schemes for the integration of a multidimensional hamiltonian system of particular physical interest was studied . in the following subsections",
    "we will discuss various approaches to integrate a general three part hamiltonian problem following the ideas presented in @xcite .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the concatenation of time symmetric splittings can produce higher order methods using analytically derived coefficients only . with this approach",
    "one can construct a si : @xmath65 of order @xmath66 starting from a si : @xmath67 of even order @xmath48 by @xmath68 with @xmath69 applying this procedure to the second order @xmath63 method ( [ eq : abc2 ] ) for @xmath70 , one obtains a si of order 4 with 13 steps , which will be called @xmath71 @xmath72 starting from @xmath71 and using equation ( [ eq : yoshida ] ) again , one could continue and build a method of order 6 .",
    "although this procedure is straightforward , it is not optimal with respect to the number of required steps , i.e. force evaluations per time step .",
    "as was already pointed out in @xcite , alternative methods can be applied to obtain more economical integrators of high order , although the new coefficients can not be given in analytical form . in this work",
    "we use a method of order 6 having in total 29 steps with @xmath73 the exact values of @xmath74 for @xmath75 can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter v , equation ( 3.11 ) ) and @xcite .      a second possibility to obtain sis for",
    "problems where @xmath57 is to split the hamiltonian in two parts as @xmath76 and @xmath77 and apply one of the various available symplectic two part algorithms @xmath78 in a successive splitting @xmath79 is approximated by an appropriate numerical scheme . to give an example : the application of the traditional leap - frog method will lead in a first step to @xmath80 . in a further splitting @xmath81",
    "is approximated again by a leap - frog step to give a second order symplectic integrator @xmath82 with @xmath83e^{\\tau/2 l_a},\\ ] ] where the brackets @xmath84 $ ] here are used only to emphasize the structure .",
    "we note that @xmath82 obtained by successive splitting of leap - frog steps is identical to @xmath63 ( see equation ( [ eq : abc2 ] ) ) .",
    "using different splitting techniques will generally lead to methods with various strengths and weaknesses . in @xcite , for instance , an integrator of second order called @xmath85 was introduced , which showed improved efficiency compared to the traditional leap - frog at only slightly larger computational cost . applying a similar splitting to our problem we obtain the integrator @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the approximation of @xmath89 again with the @xmath85 scheme leads to an integrator with 13 steps , which we call @xmath90 .",
    "each of these second order methods obtained by successive splitting can be combined into an integrator of fourth order by application of equation ( [ eq : yoshida ] ) .",
    "thus , one can construct @xmath91 having 37 simple steps from concatenations of @xmath90 .",
    "in general , the number of steps for @xmath92 grows quickly , which makes successive splitting methods computationally expensive compared to @xmath93 integrators of the same order .      of course , the numerical solution of the equations of motion for a given hamiltonian problem does not necessarily have to be performed with symplectic schemes . in principle",
    ", one can use any general - purpose non - symplectic integration scheme for this task .",
    "the disadvantage of using non - symplectic algorithms is that the error in the total energy of the system grows with time .",
    "therefore , different epochs of the system s evolution are computed with different accuracy . especially for problems where the asymptotic behavior of the system in the later stages of the evolution is of main interest ,",
    "this represents a serious drawback .",
    "nevertheless , we will compare the performance of symplectic algorithms to solutions obtained using the ` classic ' explicit runge - kutta method of order 4 ( @xmath94 ) with a fixed time step .      as a first step in testing the efficiency of the different integration methods we apply our splitting procedures to a simple toy model described by the following hamiltonian @xmath95 where we set @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "for this ordering one can identify the map @xmath98 over one time step @xmath23 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 as @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103    in our tests we will compare the various methods presented earlier with regards to efficiency and energy conservation . in order to complete one time step @xmath23",
    "each method requires a different number of evaluations of @xmath104 .",
    "the total number of these evaluations gives the number of steps @xmath105 characteristic for each method .",
    "it is clear that @xmath105 will be larger for higher order methods , since more evaluations per time step are generally required . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of using higher order methods lies in that one usually gets better precision for a given time step .",
    "if a method @xmath106 needs twice the number of evaluations compared to another method @xmath107 , but the increase in precision is larger than a factor of two , we say that @xmath106 is more efficient than @xmath107 .",
    "accordingly , our tests will measure the computational gain of a method @xmath108 by @xmath109 , where @xmath105 is the number of evaluations the respective scheme needs for one time step @xmath23 .",
    "this computational gain will be compared to the precision that can be achieved with a given time step @xmath23 . in order to measure the precision of a specific integration method",
    ", we use the maximum value of the absolute relative error in energy @xmath110 accumulated over @xmath111 time steps . a performance comparison of the different methods presented in the previous sections",
    "is given in figure [ fig:1 ] .    ) and different symplectic three part split schemes for the integration of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : testh ] ) .",
    "the horizontal axis gives the computational gain @xmath112 , while the maximum value of the absolute relative energy variation over @xmath111 time steps is shown on the vertical axis.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as expected , methods of the same order show a similar behavior , i.e.  the same slope of increase in precision when the time step @xmath23 is decreased .",
    "we see that both methods of order two give almost identical results .",
    "interestingly , @xmath63 ( red line ) performs slightly worse than @xmath90 ( pink line ) despite the considerably lower number of force evaluations per step ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) . for the fourth order methods , however , we see this trend reversed . with @xmath71 ( green line )",
    "one obtains the best performance of all fourth order schemes .",
    "furthermore , both symplectic algorithms provide stable results for relatively large time steps , which is not the case for @xmath94 ( yellow line ) .",
    "the best overall performance is achieved by using the method with the highest order : @xmath115 ( blue line ) .",
    "although this method needs 29 force evaluations during each time step , it outranks other schemes in terms of computational gain for a given precision and quickly reaches the round - off limit in energy conservation .      in order to investigate the efficiency of the different sis in a more elaborate setting , we follow @xcite and consider a one - dimensional chain of coupled , nonlinear oscillators : the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) .",
    "this system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath116 with complex variables @xmath117 , lattice site indices @xmath118 and nonlinearity strength @xmath119 .",
    "the random on  site energies @xmath120 are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath121 $ ] , where @xmath122 denotes the disorder strength .",
    "this model has two integrals of motion as it conserves the energy ( [ rdnls ] ) and the norm @xmath123 , and has been extensively studied to determine the characteristics of energy spreading in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "it was shown in these studies that the second moment of the norm distribution , @xmath124 , grows subdiffusively in time @xmath16 , namely as @xmath125 .",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath126 of the exponent was theoretically predicted and numerically verified .",
    "the final fate of wave packets in multidimensional disordered lattices is a highly debatable physical problem , however .",
    "what will happen when @xmath127 ? will wave packets continue spreading for ever , as numerical simulations suggest , or will the spreading eventually stop , as claimed by some researchers @xcite ? in order to numerically tackle these questions , we need efficient integration schemes , which allow accurate integrations for times longer than the ones achieved by currently existing means . in",
    "what follows , we will have a closer look at the promising symplectic methods that were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the canonical transformation , , gives hamiltonian ( [ rdnls ] ) the form @xmath128 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generalized coordinates and momenta , respectively .",
    "we split hamiltonian ( [ hdnls ] ) into a sum of three parts , namely @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the corresponding exponential maps over one time step @xmath23 are @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the dnls model represents an ideal ` real - world ' test case for the aforementioned three part split sis .    to compare the performance of the various integration schemes we consider a particular disorder realization of the dnls model ( [ hdnls ] ) with @xmath136 lattice sites @xmath137 and fixed boundary conditions .",
    "we fix the total norm of the system to @xmath138 , and , following @xcite , we excite 21 central sites homogeneously by attributing the same constant norm to every individual site with a random initial phase . for all other sites we set @xmath139 at @xmath140 . due to the nonlinear nature of the model the norm distribution spreads , while keeping the total norm @xmath141 constant .",
    "the performance of the various integration schemes is evaluated by their ability to ( a ) reproduce the dynamics correctly , which is reflected in the subdiffusive increase of @xmath142 , ( b ) keep the values of the two integrals @xmath143 and @xmath144 constant , as monitored by the evolution of the absolute relative errors of the energy @xmath145 and of the norm @xmath146 , and ( c ) reduce the required cpu time @xmath147 for the performed computations .",
    "results obtained for the sis @xmath71 , @xmath115 and @xmath91 are presented in figure [ fig:2 ] . a more extended numerical analysis including high - performance non - symplectic schemes can be found in @xcite .",
    "( [ hdnls ] ) , by the fourth order sis @xmath91 for @xmath148 ( blue line ) , @xmath71 with @xmath149 ( green line ) and the sixth order @xmath115 for @xmath150 ( red line ) .",
    "the different panels show the time evolution of ( a ) the logarithm of the second moment @xmath142 , ( b ) the absolute relative energy error @xmath151 , ( c ) the absolute relative norm error @xmath152 and ( d ) the required cpu time @xmath147 in seconds .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    all three tested methods are used with different time steps ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) , chosen in such a way as to provide a comparable error in energy conservation . in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we see that all of these integration methods are able to correctly describe the system s dynamical evolution , since the wave packet s @xmath124 shows practically the same behavior in all cases ( figure [ fig:2]a ) .",
    "figure [ fig:2]b shows , that all integration methods are able to keep the local relative energy error practically constant at @xmath156 .",
    "the relative norm error @xmath157 , however , grows with time for all applied methods ( figure [ fig:2]c ) especially for @xmath71 and @xmath115 .",
    "the @xmath157 for @xmath91 increases only slightly in the tested integration interval .",
    "nevertheless , our results indicate that all methods can keep @xmath157 at acceptable levels ( e.g. @xmath158 ) , even for long time integrations such as needed for asymptotic studies of the dnls model .",
    "the @xmath71 and @xmath115 sis require less cpu times compared to the @xmath91 method ( figure [ fig:2]d ) , with @xmath115 showing again the best performance . from the sis performance presented in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we conclude that one obtains satisfying results with all symplectic three part split methods . regarding the inter - si competition , we find that using @xmath115 with @xmath150 requires @xmath159 times less cpu time than the @xmath91 with @xmath148 .",
    "our results indicate that the application of efficient triple split sis allows the accurate integration of the dnls over considerably long times .",
    "thus , triple split sis will possibly allow the community to numerically tackle open questions regarding the asymptotic behavior of wave packets .",
    "in this work we have collected and tested different symplectic integration algorithms applicable to general hamiltonians , which can be split in three integrable parts . after a general introduction to the theory behind symplectic integrators",
    "we explicitly explained how one can construct high order symplectic schemes for such hamiltonians .",
    "the efficiency of the developed methods was tested on two different hamiltonian systems , a simple toy model and the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we could show that three part split symplectic integrators are very efficient tools for long time integrations of multidimensional hamiltonian systems as they tend to preserve conserved quantities and save computational time .",
