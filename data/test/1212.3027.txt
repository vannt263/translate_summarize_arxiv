    "the hubbard model@xcite of interacting fermions in a solid is a centerpiece of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "it is conventionally defined by restricting the motion of electrons in a crystalline solid to a single band , and simplifying the screened long - range coulomb interactions between electrons to an on - site repulsion :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 creates a fermion on a site @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the summation in the first term runs over the nearest - neighbor sites of the simple cubic lattice , @xmath5 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath6 is the onsite repulsion .",
    "though remarkably simple in appearance , the model has been used to study a wealth of intriguing quantum many - body phenomena that are due to electron correlations in solids , such as interaction - driven insulators @xcite , quantum magnetism and high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . however , despite more than a half of century of intensive investigation , the physics of the model is still not completely understood .",
    "the most challenging yet the most interesting regime is the intermediate regime with interaction comparable to half the bandwidth @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of nearest neighbors of a site .",
    "this regime offers no small parameter to start a controllable analytic theory .",
    "furthermore , exact analytic solutions are only accessible either in one spatial dimension @xcite or an infinite@xcite number of spatial dimensions .",
    "substantial progress has been possible with the development of efficient quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods ( for a recent review , see ref .  ) accompanied by advances in computer technology .",
    "although for generic _ bosonic _ systems virtually any equilibrium property can nowadays be calculated by qmc with a controlled high accuracy @xcite , systematic - error - free simulations of correlated _ fermions _ have been limited to a handful of special cases due to the negative sign problem @xcite .",
    "the sign problem manifests itself as an exponential scaling of the simulation time with the system volume and inverse temperature making it practically impossible to obtain any reliable information about the system in the thermodynamic ( td ) limit .",
    "although in some cases the sign problem can be completely eliminated by choosing a system - specific representation , its general solution is almost certainly not possible @xcite .",
    "a major step toward understanding strongly correlated systems has been the experimental realization of the hubbard model with ultracold atomic gases loaded into optical lattices ( for recent reviews see refs . ) .",
    "these systems offer substantial control over the hamiltonian . as a result",
    ", these experiments can serve as emulators of quantum many - body systems , which allow the accurate study of a given model in a range of parameters inaccessible by analytic and numeric techniques@xcite .",
    "the recent experimental observation of mott physics @xcite in the hubbard model is a major milestone along these lines .",
    "the next crucial step would be a realization of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition and the nel state in the hubbard model , which requires a substantial effort in reaching lower temperatures , controlling the equilibration rates , developing new probing techniques , etc .",
    "in addition to these inherent challenges , there is also a fundamental problem related to thermometry in ultracold - atom systems since they are insulated from the environment .",
    "isolated systems such as these are thus , by their nature , better characterized by entropy , rather than temperature .",
    "moreover , probes have to be calibrated in the relevant regime and the results obtained with the setup validated against available benchmarks . for these purposes , reliable and accurate numeric results for fermionic systems",
    "are indispensable because they ultimately allow a full quantitative understanding , as was recently demonstrated by the example of a bosonic optical - lattice emulator @xcite .",
    "this work provides reliable benchmarks for the realization of the nel state in optical lattices as well as for new theoretical methods .",
    "we focus on the special case of the half - filled ( @xmath9 , or equivalently @xmath10 ) three dimensional ( 3d ) hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the case of half filling is special due to the @xmath11 symmetry of the hamiltonian , which is ultimately broken by the nel state , making magnetism the leading instability . in the limit @xmath12 ,",
    "the effects of the interaction can be studied perturbatively . in the opposite limit , @xmath13 , eq .",
    "reduces to the afm heisenberg model with @xmath14 . while there is no doubt that in the strongly correlated regime the ground state of the half - filled model is afm , mapping out the finite - temperature phase diagram and studying thermodynamics of the system is extremely challenging @xcite . to this end",
    ", we employ the unbiased continuous - time determinantal diagrammatic monte carlo ( ddmc ) technique @xcite , which produces numerically exact ( up to a known statistical error bar ) results for a finite - size system , and which is free from the fermionic sign problem at half filling on bipartite lattices , allowing a reliable extrapolation of results to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we use ddmc to determine several critical properties of the hubbard model with high control and accuracy and compare with high - temperature series expansions@xcite ( htse ) where possible .",
    "we study the range of on - site interaction @xmath15 , where the critical temperature @xmath16 of the afm transition is expected to reach its maximum @xcite .",
    "results in this regime are vital to optical lattice emulator efforts offering experiments their best chance of observing the afm phase .",
    "we obtain the critical temperature @xmath16 and compute important thermodynamic properties of the model  the energy and the entropy , as well as two optical lattice observables : double occupancy and the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlation function  in the paramagnetic phase as a function of temperature down to @xmath16 . a number of previous works using different unbiased approaches studied @xmath16 ( by the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc)@xcite and the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite ) and the thermodynamic properties in question ( by ddmc@xcite , a combination of dca and ddmc@xcite , and by dqmc@xcite ) in this regime .",
    "our work improves the accuracy of the previous results at half filling and provides the most accurate to date values of the critical temperature @xmath16 and the entropy at the critical point @xmath17 ( summarized in the table .",
    "[ table : tns ] ) .",
    "accurate knowledge of @xmath16 is particularly important for determining the critical entropy @xmath17 since @xmath18 is a steep function near the transition , so that the error bar of @xmath17 is mainly due to the uncertainty in @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 are required for an experimental realization for the afm state . as was noted in ref .",
    ", close to the transition , the temperature dependence of the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlation function @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the unit vector in the direction @xmath21 ) is significantly more pronounced than that of the double occupancy @xmath22 of a lattice site making measurements of the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlations @xcite more suitable for accurate thermometry in this regime . our results for the spin - spin correlation function can be used for calibration of such a thermometer .    for over a decade , the dqmc study of the phase diagram of the half - filled 3d hubbard model by staudt _",
    "@xcite has been the main reference for @xmath16 in the correlated regime .",
    "representing the state of the art at that time , ref .",
    "provides a comprehensive comparison of the dqmc data for the nel temperature with those of preceding qmc simulations and approximate theories , e.g. , dmft @xcite .",
    "we shall not reproduce this comparison here and refer the reader to a review of results for @xmath16 predating ref .  .",
    "the simulation method of staudt _ et al . _ is based on a discrete hubbard - stratonovich decoupling in the hubbard interaction term which requires discretizing the imaginary - time interval @xmath23 into a finite number of steps of size @xmath24 thereby introducing a systematic error .",
    "hence , in addition to the standard extrapolation of the finite - size dqmc data to the td limit , one has to perform an extrapolation with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "such a double extrapolation is rather laborious . in practice @xmath24",
    "is usually fixed at a value which is large enough to allow efficient simulations , yet , according to ref .",
    ", such that `` the results are not significantly affected by the extrapolation @xmath25 '' . in the absence of an explicit extrapolation , the degree of control over systematic errors can be questioned .",
    "this is where our approach is a major improvement over that of staudt _ et al . _",
    "the ddmc technique is formulated directly in continuous imaginary time .",
    "therefore finite - size corrections are the only systematic error we have to eliminate in our approach .",
    "the cost of the absence of the additional systematic error is the computation complexity of the ddmc , which scales as @xmath26 ^ 3 \\omega^3 $ ] versus the linear in @xmath27 \\omega^3 $ ] scaling of the dqmc of ref .  , for lattices with @xmath28 sites . as a result",
    ", we are limited by the values of interaction @xmath29 , whereas staudt _",
    "_ were able to study the model up to @xmath30 .",
    "we have also been able to identify the transition itself with a considerable improvement in accuracy over ref .  .",
    "long - range afm order in the system causes divergence of the magnetic structure factor @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the afm wave vector , so that @xmath34 is related to the magnetization @xmath35 in the td limit , @xmath36 . in ref .",
    ", the transition temperature is found as the point at which @xmath35 starts to noticeably deviate from zero , while the magnetization is obtained from a finite - size extrapolation of @xmath37 with respect to @xmath38 . here",
    "the scaling power of the finite - size corrections was used as a fitting parameter .",
    "an additional ( indirect ) probe of the transition used by staudt _",
    "_ is the peak in the dependence of the specific heat on temperature .",
    "in contrast , we use a much more accurate method to determine the critical point .",
    "we find the critical point using a finite - size scaling analysis of @xmath39 in combination with the technique of binder crossings @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to get a reliable and accurate value of @xmath40 by making use of the known scaling law of the magnetic structure factor at the critical point , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the anomalous dimension of the particular universality class , so that the quantity @xmath43 becomes scale - invariant at the critical temperature up to non - universal corrections , which we also take into account . since the nel transition is breaking the @xmath11 symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian at half - filling",
    ", the universality class is that of the 3d heisenberg model , which provides the critical exponents for the finite - size scaling analysis .    in the context of previous calculations of the nel temperature ,",
    "it is worth noting the work by kent _",
    "@xcite , where @xmath16 was found from calculations using dca .",
    "although this work did not lead to any improvement of the precision claimed by staudt _",
    ", it was shown that the dca can be used to determine the critical point with a controlled accuracy based on significantly smaller clusters of only @xmath44 lattice sites versus up to @xmath45 sites in ref .   and",
    "in this work .",
    "in addition , good agreement with the values of @xmath16 of ref",
    ".   suggested that potential systematic error of the @xmath25 extrapolation in ref .   is likely to be small . in the range of interaction @xmath46 , our results for @xmath16 agree within the error bars with those of refs .   implicitly confirming this . at smaller",
    "@xmath47 , however , we find somewhat lower values of @xmath16 . moreover , at @xmath48 , being unable to reach significantly low temperatures to accurately infer the critical point , we can only claim an upper bound from our finite - size - scaling analysis , @xmath49 , which is already lower than the values claimed in refs .  .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is likely to be the long - range character of correlations at smaller coupling , which can be missed in simple finite - size extrapolation schemes based on data for insufficiently large systems .",
    "the thermodynamics of the hubbard model near the nel transition in connection with its experimental realization has been the focus of a number of recent studies @xcite .",
    "the dmft results @xcite emphasize the role of double occupancy in detecting the build up of afm correlations .",
    "however , its dependence on temperature near the nel transition is relatively flat in the regime where @xmath16 is maximal , as observed in unbiased ( extrapolated to the td limit ) dca calculations @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the energy and the entropy down to @xmath16 in this regime as well as the equation of state away from half filling , which allowed to get an estimate of the entropy at the transition in a realistic harmonically trapped system .",
    "a study@xcite of the system using the same dqmc method as ref .   arrived at an agreement with the results and conclusions of fuchs _",
    "et al._.    the ddmc simulation method used in this work is not capable of capturing thermodynamics of the hubbard model away from half filling due to the pronounced negative sign problem .",
    "however , exactly at half filling , it has certain advantages over dca and dqmc . as discussed above , in order to claim unbiased results in the td limit within dqmc one has to resort to a double extrapolation , @xmath50 .",
    "ddmc is formulated directly in continuous time allowing a more reliable extrapolation to the td limit .",
    "modern efficient solvers for dca also work in continuous time , but the cluster sizes amenable to simulation in the regime of interest are typically less then @xmath51",
    ". however , in dca the clusters are embedded in a self - consistently defined medium , which largely improves the convergence to the td limit . in practice",
    "the finite - size dependence for the accessible clusters is notably larger than that in ddmc @xcite .",
    "hence , at half filling and @xmath52 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are expected to reach their maxima , ddmc currently allows to obtain the most reliable benchmarks for the thermodynamic quantities of interest .",

    "the appendix contains tables of the obtained numerical data for the entropy , energy , double occupancy , and spin - spin correlation functions as a function of temperature .",
    "we first rewrite the hubbard hamiltonian to a form suitable for numerical simulations by mapping the repulsive model to an attractive model by a particle - hole transformation @xcite .",
    "we use the fact that the simple cubic lattice is bipartite and can be split into two interpenetrating sublattices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that the hopping term in only connects sites belonging to different sublattices .",
