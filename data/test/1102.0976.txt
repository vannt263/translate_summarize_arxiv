    "josephson junction arrays ( jja ) have been widely studied , both theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "they show a number of phenomena , vortex physics@xcite , quantum phase transitions .",
    "they are also a paradigm ; a large variety of physical systems can be modelled using josephson junctions arrays , for example , one - dimensional thin superconducting wires@xcite and granular superconductors . nowadays",
    ", they are used to realize protected qbits@xcite or for metrological applications , for establishing current standards through frequency measurements of shapiro steps@xcite .    here",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the 1-dimensional case .",
    "furthermore , we shall neglect dissipation , which is crucial in some quantum wires .",
    "no coupling to a dissipative environment is considered . for normal regular junction chains ,",
    "the essential physics is the competition between josephson coupling and local coulomb interactions . in one dimension ,",
    "true long range order can not exist , the correlations of the superconducting order parameter decay at best as a power law .",
    "when local coulomb interactions are increased , the power law is modified , and eventually a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition occurs . beyond the transition , when coulomb interaction dominates , the decay of correlations becomes exponential .",
    "this is due to the unbinding of phase slips , whose existence have been shown directly in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "topological defects have always played a central role , from bkt transitions in magnets , roughening of interfaces , disordered luttinger liquids and some stripe models for high-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "we would like in this paper to study the role of long range coulomb interactions , hereafter denoted as lri , which have not been taken into account so far in one - dimensional jj chains .",
    "one motivation is that , in one - dimensional clean superconducting wires , the long range part of the coulomb interactions is poorly screened .",
    "for example , the plasma mode frequency goes to zero for small frequency@xcite .",
    "this has motivated some recent studies@xcite .",
    "clearly , in these systems , fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter have to be taken into account .",
    "the hamiltonian looks very much like the one of a one - dimensional josephson array , with a long range coulomb term in addition .",
    "long range interactions , hereafter denoted by lri , were studied a long time ago at the spin - wave level for electronic systems@xcite .",
    "they also appear naturally in modelling underdoped high-@xmath2 superconductors , where phase fluctuations of the order parameter are important@xcite .",
    "influence of lri have also been studied recently@xcite theoretically in two and three dimensions .",
    "our goal is to obtain the phase correlator of the superconducting order parameter as a function of time and space .",
    "this quantity governs numerous physical properties . in this paper",
    ", we shall give only one application .",
    "namely , we calculate the average andreev current from a normal metal to a jj chain .",
    "because lri are normally screened in fabricated jj chains , the model discussed here is not meant to be a realistic model for a jj chain but can be relevant to thin 1-dimensional superconducting wires .",
    "however , calculations developped in this paper can be adapted to take into account the screening of the coulomb interaction between islands and make predictions about andreev current in real jj chains .",
    "after the introduction , the body of the paper is organized in four parts .    in part two",
    ", we first describe the model of jj chain we use , and its connection to high-@xmath2 materials .",
    "it is convenient to go to imaginary time .",
    "when the josephson coupling dominates over the coulomb repulsion , if phase slips are neglected , the modes are spin waves .",
    "the long range interactions cause the decay of correlations to change from those of a luttinger liquid to a more pronounced decay@xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we take into account phase slips .",
    "the hamiltonian decouples into a part describing spin - waves ( long wavelength excitations ) and another part describing phase slips ( rapid variations of the phase ) . in the last sections ,",
    "we discuss the interaction between phase slips . for distances much smaller than a characteristic distance",
    ", they interact logarithmically . beyond this distance",
    ", the interaction behaves only as the square root of the logarithm of the distance@xcite .    in part three",
    ", we examine how the kt real space renormalization group ( rg ) analysis is modified by lri .",
    "there , as soon as lri are present , strictly speaking , no quasi long range order is possible anymore .",
    "however , the initial long range interactions can be very weak .",
    "if we iterate the rg flow , it will take some time for lri to alter the behavior of the usual kt flow .",
    "the lri will show up only after a certain crossover `` time '' , which we calculate and corresponds to some temperature @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", rg has to be stopped at some cutoff `` time '' , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in order to see the influence of lri , the temperature must be lower than @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on the values of parameters such as the coulomb energy , josephson coupling and strength of lri is explicited .",
    "part four is devoted to the calculation of the phase correlation function .",
    "analytical continuation is required to obtain the correlator in real time .",
    "this part is rather technical ; some aspects of the calculations are relegated to appendices .",
    "the main result is the expression of the phase correlator , which differs from the usual ornstein - zernike expression .    in the last part",
    ", we discuss one physical situation .",
    "the andreev current between a metal and a jj chain , as a function of applied voltage is calculated .",
    "we compare the curves obtained in three cases .",
    "the first case corresponds to only on - site coulomb interaction . in the second case , a coulomb interaction between nearest - neighbor islands is added .",
    "this model is often used in the literature . finally , in the third case , lri are added .",
    "for relatively low voltages , the andreev current remains always smaller with lri .",
    "we focuse on the case where , without lri , we would be in the disordered phase .",
    "there is a threshold voltage @xmath1 below which no andreev current can flow .",
    "this remains true in the presence of lri .",
    "however , the current versus voltage ( @xmath0 ) curves are different from the case without lri . without lri ,",
    "the andreev current starts as @xmath5 , whereas with lri , it starts to increase faster than any power law .",
    "this can be viewed as a signature of lri and could be tested in experiments .    in the conclusion ,",
    "we discuss two possible applications , one for realistic fabricated jj chains and the other for one - dimensional superconducting wires .",
    "for jj chains , the interaction between island charges is screened but the methods used in this paper can be adapted to make at least qualitative predictions . for 1d wires , owing to the strong dependence of a phase slip fugacity with temperature and wire width , and also for other reasons detailed below ,",
    "it is not obvious that lri can be detected experimentally .",
    "maybe they could for very long wires .",
    "we would like to study the influence of poorly screened coulomb interactions in 1 dimension .",
    "one possibility , which has been widely used some time ago , mainly in dimensions two and three , would be to take the hamiltonian for a bcs superconductor @xcite and to introduce hubbard - stratonovich transformations in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels in order to make the usual gap @xmath7 appear .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations are integrated out , so are the phase of the density fluctuations , leaving us with a phase action only .",
    "this procedure has been used in ref . , except that they stayed at the rpa level and did not consider topological excitations for the phase @xmath8 of the order parameter .",
    "another way would be to start with a one - dimensional array of josephson junctions , modelled by an ideal josephson junction ( jj ) and a capacity @xmath9 in parallel .",
    "in addition , on each island , the capacity to the ground has @xmath10 to be taken into account .",
    "cm    the hamiltonian is @xmath11 with @xmath12 and the interaction potential @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the capacitance matrix . the last term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) represents lri , @xmath15 is a constant and @xmath16 a capacity .",
    "usually , only the capacity of one junction @xmath9 and the capacity from an island to the ground @xmath10 are taken into account , the capacity matrix @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 if @xmath19 , @xmath20 if @xmath21 , and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "it is reasonable to approximate the interaction potential@xcite by the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the screening length is of the order @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the interjunction spacing . typically , for one - dimensional fabricated chains@xcite @xmath27 but still @xmath28 is of order @xmath29 to @xmath30 , not more .",
    "lri thus do not appear to be completely realistic for fabricated jj chains , but for thin superconducting wires , the coulomb interaction is badly screened@xcite and can be longer range . we shall thus take a hamiltonian of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 typically an effective capacitance to the ground .",
    "we can also see this hamiltonian as a 1d analog of the following hamiltonian for superconductors with fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter @xmath33 in this case , @xmath34 is the superfluid density in 3d .",
    "@xmath35 is the charge density , @xmath36 will denote the phase of the order parameter .",
    "its conjugate variable is @xmath37 , which is proportional to the charge @xmath38 . when phase slips are neglected , the procedure to obtain an effective action for @xmath36 is standard and we just recall it here for completeness .",
    "writing @xmath39 with @xmath40 integers , @xmath41 and @xmath40 are conjugate variables , @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the charging energy for nearest neighbor . following ref .",
    ", @xmath45 denoting the temperature and @xmath46 , the partition function is calculated in imaginary time , by discretizing in time steps of size @xmath47 . the system without lri",
    "would be equivalent to a usual xy model with isotropic coupling . in the following , @xmath48 will no longer be operators but numbers ; index @xmath49 from 1 to @xmath50 denotes the position in real space and the second index @xmath51 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 the position on the imaginary time axis . making @xmath54 , the partition function reads @xmath55 where the sum is on all configurations @xmath56 .",
    "now , in the spin - wave approximation , the cosines are expanded and the lagrangean @xmath57 and action @xmath58 take the form @xmath59    applying a fourier transform and integrating out the @xmath60 field , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential , regularized@xcite at very small @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath63 is in fact @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the fourier transform in space of @xmath48 .",
    "rescaling the imaginary time and counting it in units of @xmath47 , and setting @xmath54 gives the effective action on a discrete space - time lattice @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 the fourier transform in space of @xmath48 defined as @xmath69 for @xmath38 multiples of @xmath70 .",
    "now , taking into account the periodic character of @xmath36 , we can take the effective action @xmath71    having derived an effective action , we first turn to the case where the periodic character of the phase can be neglected .",
    "the approximation is good for large @xmath72 .",
    "cooper pairs feel very little coulomb - blockade .",
    "the fugacity of phase slips goes essentially@xcite as @xmath73 .",
    "phase slips are neglected and a phase correlator derived . owing to lri , the system is no more a luttinger liquid .",
    "correlations ressemble some correlators appearing in one - dimensional quantum wires with low electron densities@xcite , sometimes dubbed `` wigner crystals '' .      in this section",
    ", we allow only smooth variations of @xmath36 . it is then possible to expand the cosine term .",
    "this gives immediately a spin - wave hamiltonian .",
    "we check here the known spin wave dispersion relations .",
    "@xmath74 with @xmath75 for small @xmath38 . setting @xmath76 , this results in @xmath77 and",
    "thus @xmath78 where @xmath46 and @xmath79 are the bosonic matsubara frequencies . for distances @xmath80 and times @xmath81 not too long , so that the long range term does not influence the behavior , the correlations are those of a luttinger liquid @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a short range cutoff ( corresponding to finite bandwidth ) , whereas for very large times@xcite , @xmath84 if @xmath81 is counted in units of @xmath85 .",
    "the correlation function of @xmath86 for spin - waves read @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "we would like to calculate the full correlation function , not only in the spin wave approximation , but including phase - slips .",
    "this turns out to be more intricate , we will neglect all factors that vary slower than any power law , such as , for example , logarithmic corrections or terms as @xmath89 with @xmath90 a constant . within this approximation , we have the spin - wave correlator @xmath91      now , we take into account phase slips , that is vortices for the @xmath6 model in 1 space and 1 time dimension . the procedure to split",
    "the action into two parts , one due to spin - waves and the other to vortices is standard without lri , however we recall it here with some details to point out the influence of lri .",
    "we use the model of villain and transform the exponential of the cosine term in ( [ effectiveaction ] ) as the sum over @xmath92 integers but with a quadratic action@xcite , involving @xmath36 and @xmath92 .",
    "the space direction will be denoted as @xmath80 and the imaginary time direction as @xmath93 .",
    "the long range interaction occurs only in the @xmath80 direction , for bonds directed in the @xmath93 direction .",
    "let us denote by @xmath94 as a consequence , the coulomb term , i.e. the second term on the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ effectiveaction ] ) , has to be modified from @xmath95 to @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the ( @xmath98 times ) integer attached to the bond which goes from site @xmath99 to site @xmath100 , and pertaining to the @xmath93 direction .",
    "the @xmath101 are simply the fourier transforms of the @xmath102 .",
    "the lattice spacing will be denoted @xmath26 , and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) will be the unit vector in the @xmath80 ( @xmath93 ) direction .",
    "the part not involving the @xmath105 s is of the type @xmath106 so that finally the total action is of the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the unit lattice vectors .",
    "@xmath111 is an infinitesimally small positive quantity .",
    "from now on , we will denote @xmath112 so that @xmath113 has components @xmath114 .",
    "the only difference with the normal xy model is that the coupling constant in the @xmath93 direction has a dependence in @xmath115 for small @xmath115 ( long wavelengths ) .    setting @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 diagonalizing this action yields the decomposition into a continuous field @xmath119 and a discrete field @xmath120 .",
    "the action must be of the form @xmath121 where @xmath83 and @xmath122 take two values , @xmath80 and @xmath93 .",
    "the quantities @xmath123 and @xmath124 are functions of @xmath113 . the linear transformation is given explicitly by @xmath125 and @xmath126 if @xmath127 and zero otherwise .",
    "next , @xmath128 is rewritten in terms of vortices defined as @xmath129 which yields the vortex hamiltonian @xmath130 the apparent divergence at @xmath131 is in fact absent because of charge neutrality @xmath132 . going back to real space , denoting @xmath133 ,",
    "the total number of sites : @xmath134 enables to rewrite the vortex hamiltonian as @xmath135 with , taking into account values of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 first , the self - interaction @xmath140 has to be withdrawn , but it is not so crucial because of charge neutrality ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "second , the vortex hamiltonian as it stands is incomplete .",
    "the vortex fugacity term , of the form @xmath142 is missing , with @xmath143 being the fugacity of a vortex .",
    "in fact , one should start with a generalized villain model @xcite , introduced by jos , kadanoff , kirkpatrick and nelson , hereafter denoted by jkkn . as noted in ref .",
    ", such a term is naturally generated by real space ( migdal - kadanoff ) renormalization .",
    "it is therefore necessary to reinstall this term .",
    "next , we look at the shape of the interaction between vortices .",
    "although it is known that , with lri , the vortex - vortex coupling for large separations @xcite ( much larger than the lattice constant ) goes only as in @xmath144 , we need to derive a quantitative expression . the behavior is dominated by the behavior of the integral for small @xmath145 .",
    "for theses small wave - vectors , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath26 being the lattice constant . we can take @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "@xmath150 the cosine term will be close to @xmath52 only for @xmath115 much lower than @xmath151 , and @xmath152 much lower than @xmath153 . to extract the main behavior for large distances @xmath154",
    ", we can replace it by the integral @xmath155 where @xmath156 is a wave - vector much larger than @xmath157 , but still sufficiently small that the expansion of @xmath158 and @xmath159 for small @xmath160 holds .",
    "the integral reads @xmath161    as @xmath154 gets large , for @xmath162 different from @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 goes to infinity , so the first @xmath166 term in the bracket is close to @xmath164 whereas the second @xmath166 term remains much smaller than @xmath52 , provided @xmath167 is not too small .",
    "we can thus safely replace the term into brackets by @xmath164 .",
    "the integral on @xmath115 is then readily performed and is in @xmath168 .",
    "the limit @xmath169 is singular .",
    "it is better to discuss limiting cases .",
    "case 1 : @xmath170 @xmath171 ,    this corresponds to distances where the decrease of the correlations due to long range unscreened coulomb interactions still has not taken place .",
    "we have then @xmath172    case 2 : @xmath170 @xmath173 ,    this corresponds to distances where the decrease of the correlations due to long range unscreened coulomb interactions has taken place .",
    "we have then @xmath174 thus , at very large distances , there is no longer sufficient interaction between vortices to hold them tied together , whatever the short range term is @xcite .",
    "mathematically the bkt transition is expected to disappear .",
    "however , we need to put this on a more quantitative basis .",
    "furthermore , in real systems , the coulomb interactions remain unscreened only up to a certain screening length @xmath175 , which can be large but is not infinite .",
    "also , the magnitude of the lri coulomb term may be much smaller than the one of the local coulomb term . in order to determine the phase diagram and the phase correlations , we need to implement a real space renormalization group scheme analog to the one developped in refs . .",
    "care has to be taken since lri will eventually dominate under the rg group . the last term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is more relevant than the second one .",
    "however , under the rg fow , it will take some time for the last term ( lri ) to overcome the effect of the local one ( i.e. the second term in eq .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of lri in one - dimensional quantum wires with very low electron densities ; there are important differences however .",
    "there will be remnants of the bkt transition .",
    "to proceed , we perform a rg in real space closely following kosterlitzoriginal paper @xcite .",
    "a quick look at the situation is that , owing to the coulomb potential , at very large distances @xmath176 , the interaction between vortices goes like @xmath177 ( instead of @xmath178 in the usual case ) , and is too weak to overcome the entropy term for placing a free vortex , which goes as @xmath178 . nevertheless , the last terms in eqs .",
    "( [ hjja],[hsupra1d ] ) can be small compared to the second ones , even if they are less relevant in rg sense , their initial value can be much smaller .",
    "thus , it makes sense to treat them as a small perturbation , at least initially .",
    "this leads us to investigate how the usual kt rg flow is modified .      here",
    ", the partition function has a form which is slightly different from the usual kt flow .",
    "the gas is neutral , without electric field .",
    "@xmath92 will be the number of `` @xmath179 '' charges .",
    "@xmath180 where @xmath181 is a coupling constant , @xmath182 and @xmath183 is a function that behaves as @xmath52 for not too large @xmath184 but decays as @xmath185 for very large @xmath186 .",
    "a model @xmath183 can be @xmath187 @xmath81 is the short time cutoff and @xmath188 the fugacity .    in the case where the long range term is much smaller than the short range one ( at the beginning of the renormalization procedure only )",
    ", we can however follow the same steps as kosterlitz .",
    "the details are shown in appendix a. we express the rg equation , using the variables @xmath189 now , with the long range interaction , this becomes @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "note that @xmath192 can be much smaller than one .",
    "now , because @xmath192 is non - zero , the line @xmath193 is no longer a line of ( stable or unstable ) fixed points .",
    "the flow is no longer autonomous , as soon as @xmath194 .",
    "we expect a deformation of the usual flow .",
    "in particular , the line @xmath193 which was a line of fixed points in regular kt flow is no longer a true line of fixed points .",
    "cm    if the lri were absent , we could be either in the case where phase correlations are decaying exponentially ( disordered phase ) or in the `` ordered '' phase , where correlations decay as a power law . in the first case , adding the long range interactions will just make the phase correlation length smaller .",
    "the more interesting case is when we start from the ordered phase .",
    "we thus examine quantitatively how switching lri drives us into the disordered phase and , in the next section , we shall examine what the phase correlations look like .",
    "in the usual case , ( without lri ) , the flow is autonomous ( i.e. does not depend explicitly on time ) and trajectories are of the form @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the starting point . setting @xmath197 , they are hyperbolae in the @xmath198 plane . in the `` ordered '' phase ,",
    "the flow on the invariant curves is : @xmath199 which integrates to @xmath200 @xmath201 is the initial `` time '' which can be set to zero .",
    "integration to obtain @xmath202 is also straightforward .",
    "the important thing is that , as @xmath203 becomes very large , @xmath204 , which is related to the fugacity , tends to zero exponentially , while @xmath202 tends to a strictly positive value @xmath205 , see fig .",
    "2 .    in our case , ( with lri ) , we can see what happens by performing the following approximation :    - if @xmath206 is much smaller than @xmath204 , we neglect it ,    - when , it becomes of the order of @xmath204 , we do the opposite and neglect @xmath204 in the r. h. s. of the @xmath207 expression , eq .",
    "( [ firstflowequation ] ) .",
    "thus , there are at least two stages . in the first stage",
    ", we have the usual kt flow whereas in the second stage the long range term comes into play .",
    "we shall see that there are three stages actually .",
    "we now describe the first stage . starting from a definite value of @xmath204 , by the regular kt flow , @xmath204 will decrease .",
    "suppose that @xmath204 has decreased by a substantial amount , such that @xmath204 will be much smaller than @xmath208 .",
    "this enables to replace @xmath209 by @xmath210 . inverting the relation yields @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "( @xmath213 is not necessarily much larger than one ) .",
    "the physics is that @xmath208 is proportional to the initial distance to the separatrix .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath214 in the thermal x - y model .",
    "now , we have to stop when @xmath204 reaches the value @xmath215 , because we are no longer allowed to neglect the term @xmath216 in eq .",
    "( [ firstflowequation ] ) .",
    "this happens when @xmath217 to get the main feeling , we can show that the typical value of @xmath203 for which this happens is @xmath218 , such that @xmath219 .",
    "this corresponds to a typical imaginary time @xmath220 , or corresponding lengthscale @xmath221 such that @xmath222 neglecting @xmath223 contributions , @xmath224 , the corresponding value of @xmath204 is @xmath225 @xmath224 goes to zero as @xmath192 goes to zero .",
    "now , we will enter the second stage .",
    "we now describe this second stage , where the second term in eq .",
    "( [ firstflowequation ] ) becomes larger than @xmath204 .",
    "then , for @xmath203 larger than @xmath226 , we integrate the rg equations , neglecting the @xmath204 term with respect to @xmath206 .",
    "@xmath227 and , using the other flow equation to obtain @xmath204 , @xmath228    then , @xmath202 will decrease and @xmath204 will continue to decrease , till @xmath202 passes the value @xmath163 .",
    "@xmath204 will be minimum for @xmath229 and then will start to increase .",
    "in fact , it increases faster than exponentially , so it will quickly become larger than @xmath230 , so that our approximation will fail .",
    "the value of @xmath231 for which this happens can be estimated , but anyway @xmath232 , corresponding to a length @xmath233 .",
    "then , there is a third stage , where @xmath204 becomes larger than @xmath234 .",
    "then , we can again neglect @xmath235 in front of @xmath204 .",
    "we are then in the third regime which has analogies with the kt flow but on the disordered part of the transition .",
    "this lasts till @xmath204 has reached an appreciable value such that one is no longer in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "let @xmath236 be the corresponding value of @xmath203 , and @xmath237 .",
    "@xmath238 will be also of order @xmath239 . since @xmath208 is proportional to @xmath240 , where @xmath2 is the transition temperature without lri , it is tempting to conclude that",
    ", since @xmath192 goes as @xmath241 , the correlation length with lri @xmath242 behaves as @xmath243 with @xmath244 an unimportant constant of order one .",
    "it has the same form as the kt correlation length in the disordered phase ( without lri ) but @xmath245 replaces the usual@xcite constant @xmath246 .",
    "of course , @xmath242 tends to infinity as @xmath192 tends to zero .",
    "the general shape of the `` flow diagram '' is best seen on fig .",
    "2 .    renormalization has to be stopped when @xmath81 becomes equal to @xmath247 .",
    "equating @xmath242 to @xmath248 yields a temperature @xmath3 given by @xmath249 with @xmath2 the critical temperature in the absence of lri .",

    "renormalizes to zero or not , resulting in the usual schmid transition .",
    "the spatial structure on the x axis has been completely lost and the long - range interaction do not play any role , except that they changed slightly the values of @xmath477 .",
    "thus , in this case , lri do not seem to play an important role .",
    "thus , in order to see the influence of lri , longer wires are needed .    for longer wires ( but not totally unrealistic , a few microns long )",
    ", we can expect temperatures larger than @xmath478 , so that renormalization has to be cut on the imaginary time axis first .",
    "then , lri will drive the resistance @xmath176 to a finite value .",
    "if @xmath176 versus @xmath45 curves are plotted , no curve should plunge towards zero resistance , unless @xmath45 becomes of the order of @xmath478 , which is about @xmath479 for @xmath480 .",
    "there are difficulties to see lri",
    ". one could be that stray capacities ( unavoidable in experiments ) can also cut the long - range term in the capacitance for small @xmath38 ( in real space ) so that @xmath481 is no longer of the form @xmath482 for small @xmath160 .",
    "this depends on the charateristics of the wires .",
    "another problem is that the action for a single phase slip , which controls its bare fugacity , is strongly dependent on temperature and on the diameter of the wire .",
    "this dependence seems to be more important than the interaction bewteen phase - slips in determining the shape of the curves showing the resistance @xmath176 versus @xmath45 , for different wire thicknesses @xcite .",
    "long range interactions are originally not screened in isolated one - dimensional wires .",
    "however , the presence of an environment could alter the screening .",
    "situations where a plate or a wire is placed in the vicinity of a superconducting thin wire are now experimentally@xcite and theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "this aims at providing mechanisms of dissipation so as to damp the phase fluctuations .",
    "though we did not consider in this paper coupling to an external environment , our calculation may be viewed as a first step towards understanding the role of lri , including , both spin waves and phase slips ( solitons ) .        in this appendix , we derive the rg flow in the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "we define @xmath483 as @xmath484 with @xmath485 integration has to be done over @xmath486 in the whole plane except the two circles of radii @xmath81 around @xmath487 and @xmath488 . setting @xmath489 and denoting by @xmath188 the vortex fugacity ,",
    "the partition function @xmath307 reads @xmath490 where @xmath491 is the whole plane except aera inside the circle of radii @xmath81 around the @xmath492 , @xmath493 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath494 where @xmath449 is the whole plane except the two circles of radii @xmath81 around @xmath487 and @xmath488 .",
    "given the value of @xmath495 , see eq .",
    "( [ fcaleq ] ) , we have @xmath496 for @xmath497 .",
    "denote by @xmath498 where @xmath58 is the aera .",
    "collecting all the terms , @xmath499 using @xmath500 , for small @xmath80 , @xmath501        if @xmath507 were a constant , we would retrieve the usual kt flow .",
    "however , since we are looking at larger and larger lengthscales , the effective coupling will not only decrease because of rg but also because of its @xmath508 dependence .",
    "the smallest @xmath176 contributing to @xmath307 is @xmath81 .",
    "thus , adding a term proportional to @xmath509 will take this into account .",
    "now , the partition function has to be rearranged so as to look as its original form , with renormalized parameters and an overall multiplicative factor , setting @xmath510 , we obtain @xmath511 switching to the usual variables @xmath512 and linearizing around @xmath229 , the flow reads @xmath513 with @xmath514 .      here",
    ", we give details on the contributions to the vortex part of the correlation function @xmath255 coming from smooth variations of @xmath515 .",
    "the first term to evaluate is @xmath516 where the double integral extends over the whole shaded surface in fig .",
    "@xmath315 is the laplacian operator ( with respect to variable @xmath254 ) . in this calculation , @xmath260 and @xmath259",
    "are fixed , and , without restriction , @xmath259 is taken to be zero for simplicity .",
    "if @xmath176 is the modulus of @xmath254 , since @xmath345 decreases as @xmath517 for large @xmath176 , it turns out that @xmath314 behaves , as @xmath518 .",
    "thus , @xmath519 behaves as @xmath520 .",
    "when surface integration is performed , the integral tends to a constant , for @xmath521 because of the @xmath522 factor .",
    "when exponentiated this will give a constant .",
    "since , we shall neglect all terms that depend on @xmath523 , weaker than any power law , we shall neglect this factor .",
    "the second term is a line integral over the outer contour @xmath321 on fig . 4 ,",
    "@xmath524 where @xmath324 is the normal to the contour @xmath321 which is here chosen as a circle of radius @xmath322 .",
    "for all @xmath254 s belonging to @xmath321 , @xmath176 are equal to @xmath322 and @xmath345 are of order @xmath525 , the leading terms in @xmath526 are of order @xmath527 .",
    "thus @xmath327 is at most of order @xmath528 and vanishes as @xmath322 goes to infinity .",
    "the third term to evaluate is a line integral over the inner contour @xmath319 .",
    "4 . @xmath529 a calculation completely analogous to the case without lri shows that the leading terms are of order @xmath530 , with @xmath523 the modulus of @xmath531 .",
