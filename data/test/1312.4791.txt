    "many of the most accurate heavy - quark mass determinations are related to the spectral functions of the heavy - quark vector current , which can be measured in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the energy region near the pair production threshold is particularly sensitive to the mass value .",
    "the bottom and charm masses are usually inferred from suitable averages of the pair production cross section .",
    "looking to the future , the measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in the threshold region at the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) would lead to a very precise knowledge of the top mass directly from the energy dependence of the cross section , even though the toponium resonances are smeared out due to the large top quark width  @xcite . to put this into perspective",
    ", the current top mass value from direct production at the fermilab tevatron is @xmath5gev @xcite , and @xmath6gev from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) run at @xmath7tev centre - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "a less precise value can be obtained from the total production cross section as illustrated for example in @xcite .",
    "further reduction of the uncertainty below the one of the tevatron result is very difficult due to the complicated theoretical systematics of top jet mass reconstruction at hadron colliders .",
    "the above numbers should be compared to a precision of @xmath8mev that can be achieved experimentally  @xcite from the @xmath9 threshold scan at the ilc . in particular , while it is not evident which renormalized top mass parameter is determined with the quoted accuracy at the tevatron and lhc , the threshold cross section in @xmath0 collisions provides an observable that can be unambiguously related to a particular top mass definition .    aside from determining a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "accurate top mass measurements are of interest for extrapolating the sm or its tev scale extension to higher energies , either in the context of `` electroweak precision tests '' or a theory of the yukawa couplings .",
    "furthermore , the recent discovery of a higgs boson @xcite with a mass of about 125@xmath10gev if interpreted as the sm higgs boson determines the higgs self - coupling and leads to the conclusion that the sm vacuum becomes metastable at scales above @xmath11gev  @xcite .",
    "the precise value of this scale turns out to depend very sensitively on the value of the top quark mass . finally , the absence of any hint on physics beyond the sm in high - energy collisions at lhc has renewed the interest in performing precision measurements of properties of sm particles , including the top quark mass , width and yukawa coupling .",

    "the challenge is thus to calculate the heavy - quark to zero in the top - quark expressions . ]",
    "spectral functions precisely in the threshold region .",
    "this kinematic region is characterized by two features , which make the theoretical calculation of qcd corrections rather different from standard loop calculations : the small three - velocity @xmath12 of the heavy quarks , which allows to expand feynman diagrams in @xmath12 rather than calculate them exactly , and the strong colour - coulomb force , which on the other hand requires certain diagrams to be summed to all orders in the strong coupling @xmath13 similar to bound - state calculations in quantum electrodynamics .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to present results of the part of the third - order ( nnnlo ) qcd corrections to the heavy quark anti - quark pair production cross section near threshold related to the correlation function @xmath21 , which contains the all - order summation . since this concludes the non - relativistic third - order calculation , we also present details of the methods and calculations that have been used but not given in earlier publications .    for the top pair production threshold the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) approximations to the cross section ( [ systematics ] )",
    "have been examined long ago  @xcite .",
    "several other aspects of the threshold such as top momentum distributions and polarization have been computed at this order  @xcite . beyond nlo , matching the non - relativistic approximation to qcd is non - trivial , because the separation between relativistic and non - relativistic physics is no longer unambiguous . a consistent field theoretical approach based on non - relativistic effective qcd is now required . the second - order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections to the total pair production cross section",
    "have been computed in this framework about ten years ago  @xcite and turned out to be surprisingly large even for top quarks . while some of the large corrections can be understood as being due to mass renormalization  @xcite , and can be avoided by a change of renormalization convention , there remains an apparently slow convergence of successive approximations to the normalization of the cross section , which necessitates the calculation of the nnnlo term . an alternative approach that sums logarithms of @xmath12",
    "has also been pursued , and an improvement of convergence has been found in a ( still partially incomplete ) next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the nnnlo non - logarithmic terms not included in the nnll approximation are required to be certain that the theoretical calculation is sufficiently accurate for the proposed mass measurement at the ilc .",
    "this is the main motivation for the present work . over the past years",
    "a significant number of results relevant to a nnnlo calculation or partial results for third - order quarkonium energy levels and wave - functions at the origin have already appeared  @xcite . in the following we",
    "summarize the status of the nnnlo top cross section calculation , the contribution of the present paper , and what remains to be done to complete the nnnlo calculation .",
    "while the resummed cross section is calculated in an effective field theory ( eft ) , a number of matching calculations has to be performed to guarantee that the eft reproduces qcd to the required accuracy .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "hard matching ( scale @xmath22 ) yields the coefficients of the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) interactions and heavy - quark currents ; soft matching ( scale @xmath23 ) the quark - anti - quark potentials . at nnnlo",
    "the coefficients of several subleading nrqcd interactions must be determined with one - loop precision .",
    "this calculation has been performed in  @xcite . however , as shall be explained , the calculation of the cross section requires the @xmath24 terms of the coefficient functions .",
    "we therefore repeated the nrqcd matching calculation , confirm the results of  @xcite and provide the expressions for the @xmath24 terms in this paper ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hard matching of the non - relativistic currents at nnnlo is needed at the one - loop level for the sub - leading currents and at the three - loop level for the leading current .",
    "the former are known  @xcite , and will be rederived in the present paper , but only the fermionic contributions to the three - loop matching coefficient @xmath25 have been calculated up to now  @xcite . as discussed in  @xcite , the incomplete result for @xmath25 presently constitutes the most important missing nnnlo contribution to the cross section .    as concerns soft matching , the potentials of order @xmath26 must be determined with one - loop precision , the @xmath27 potential with two - loop precision , and the @xmath28 coulomb potential at three loops , since @xmath29 counts as the bohr radius @xmath30 . except for the coulomb potential ,",
    "the coefficients of the other potentials have been calculated in  @xcite , but again these results are not sufficient for the cross section calculations , since the @xmath24 terms of all these potentials are needed .",
    "we repeated the calculation of the one - loop @xmath26 potentials , confirm the results of  @xcite and provide the expressions for the @xmath24 terms in this paper ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath24 term of the two - loop @xmath27 potential coefficient @xmath31 remains presently unknown . as concerns the three - loop coulomb potential , the fermionic contributions to the three - loop coefficient @xmath32",
    "have been calculated first in  @xcite and the full result is now also known  @xcite .    to summarize : the matching coefficients required for the nnnlo calculation of the heavy - quark production cross section near threshold are known except for the non - fermionic contributions to @xmath25 , and the @xmath24 terms of @xmath31",
    ". out of these , only @xmath25 is expected to have a major impact on the final result  @xcite .",
    "work on these missing contributions is in progress .      after matching the heavy - quark currents and lagrangians the cross section calculation",
    "is mapped to the calculation of the imaginary part of the two - point function @xmath21 of non - relativistic currents in ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "the leading - order colour coulomb potential is now part of the leading - order effective lagrangian , since the coulomb interaction is strong near threshold .",
    "the propagators to be used in the perturbative calculation of the two - point function are the coulomb green functions , making this part of the computation similar to qed bound - state problems .",
    "the calculation can be divided into three parts : contributions up to the third order involving only the coulomb potential , already completed in  @xcite ; the ultrasoft contribution , appearing first at nnnlo , which has been computed in  @xcite ; and finally , contributions involving at least one potential other than the coulomb potential ( `` non - coulomb potential contribution '' ) , which are not yet known .",
    "the main result of this paper is the missing non - coulomb potential contribution .",
    "compared to the coulomb contributions the major complication is the singular nature of the potential insertions .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences must be regulated in dimensional regularization in a scheme consistent with the calculation of the matching coefficients order by order in the strong coupling , while retaining the resummation of infinitely many coulomb gluon exchanges by the use of coulomb green functions , whose @xmath33-dimensional expression is unknown .",
    "the techniques we apply are an extension of those used in the nnlo calculation  @xcite .",
    "since the method of that calculation was never written up ( though some results are scattered in @xcite ) , we devote some effort to presenting the third - order calculation in some technical detail .",
    "in addition to the dominant production of the top - quark pair though a virtual photon there is also a @xmath34-boson contribution .",
    "the contribution from the vector - coupling of the @xmath34 is trivially inferred from the photon - mediated cross section , while the axial - vector coupling contribution is suppressed near threshold and begins only at nnlo .",
    "thus , only the first - order correction to the axial - vector in non - relativistic perturbation theory is needed .",
    "some results at this order are available  @xcite , but none of these results are given in dimensional regularization .",
    "we recalculated these small contributions , and will present them elsewhere , since in this paper we focus on the missing third - order terms in the vector current contribution .    to summarize : together with the results of this paper , the matrix element calculation is complete to nnnlo .",
    "much less work has been done on electroweak and electromagnetic corrections .",
    "counting the electromagnetic and electroweak coupling as two powers of the strong coupling , electromagnetic corrections contribute from nlo through the electromagnetic coulomb potential . this effect is easily included and has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "electroweak contributions to the matching coefficients of nrqcd currents and production operators have been calculated in  @xcite .",
    "the formalism for calculating initial - state radiation , and soft and collinear photon corrections in general , simultaneous with summing coulomb exchange has been worked out in  @xcite for @xmath35-boson pair production .",
    "its application to top quarks is straightforward .",
    "it remains to be done to put all these electroweak effects together .    for top quarks",
    "the sizeable decay width @xmath36 introduces further complications . in leading order the width is correctly included by evaluating the current two - point functions in pnrqcd at complex energy argument @xmath37  @xcite , where @xmath38 .",
    "we adopt this prescription as the _ definition _ of the pure qcd contributions to the cross section .",
    "beginning at nlo there exist further contributions related to the finite width .",
    "since the physical final state is @xmath39 , boson may be regarded as stable .",
    "] there exist irreducible `` backgrounds '' related to off - shell and single or non - resonant top - quark pair production .",
    "in fact , the qcd contribution as defined above can not be unambiguously separated from electroweak effects at this order  perhaps not surprisingly , since the top quark width itself is such an effect  and the fact that a physical scattering cross section should refer only to stable ( or sufficiently long - lived ) particles in the final state , must be taken into account .",
    "the incompleteness of the qcd cross section is signaled explicitly by the presence of uncanceled singularities in dimensional regularization with coefficients proportional to @xmath36 starting at nnlo .",
    "the origin and consistent cancellation of these singularities is discussed in  @xcite and the corresponding calculations of electroweak effects and non - resonant contributions to a physical final state such as @xmath40 can in principle be performed in the framework of unstable - particle effective field theory  @xcite as already done for @xmath35 pair production  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculation of the non - resonant nlo correction for top production has been performed in  @xcite and confirmed by a different method in @xcite . rather than embarking on the rather difficult computation of non - resonant contributions up to nnnlo",
    ", however , a more promising approach suppresses them by appropriate invariant mass cuts  @xcite , which will anyway be applied experimentally .",
    "calculations of top quark pair production near threshold with cuts on the final - state @xmath41 invariant masses have appeared recently  @xcite in the non - relativistic qcd and unstable particle effective theory frameworks .",
    "as should be expected , the non - resonant contributions to the @xmath40 are sizeable below the nominal top pair production threshold , and hence can change the shape of the threshold cross section in the region of interest for the top - quark mass determination . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus only on the qcd part of the problem .",
    "we shall , however , make the finite - width @xmath42 poles explicit , so that they can be canceled analytically with future computations of electroweak effects .",
    "indeed , the pole parts of the nnlo non - resonant contribution have recently been computed  @xcite and the cancelation has been verified .    to summarize : while the formalism for computing electroweak and finite - width effects consistently is in place , and bits and pieces have already been calculated , significant work remains to be done on electroweak effects at nnnlo . with the third - order qcd calculation now being nearly complete , improvements in the prediction of realistic cross sections ( including electroweak effects and cuts ) must be made .",
    "0.3 cm since our intention to present the concepts , techniques and calculations in some detail resulted in a rather lengthy text , we have split it into two parts .",
    "part i presents the effective field theory set - up , the nrqcd and pnrqcd matching coefficients and ends with a master formula for the third - order heavy - quark pair production cross sections .",
    "this part could also be read as a review of non - relativistic effective theory in the weak - coupling regime complementary to  @xcite .",
    "part ii contains the actual pnrqcd matrix element calculation together with a numerical estimate of the new contributions to the top cross section .",
    "( a preliminary version has been presented in  @xcite . ) the small p - wave contributions to the cross section from the axial - vector coupling of the @xmath34-boson will be presented separately in  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper i is as follows : in section  [ sec : eft ] we review the effective field theory framework and discuss the power - counting arguments that lead to the identification of the matching coefficients needed for the nnnlo calculation .",
    "the subsequent two sections deal with matching qcd to a sequence of two non - relativistic effective theories , nrqcd and pnrqcd .",
    "section  [ sec : nrqcd ] discusses the nrqcd aspects of the calculation .",
    "in particular , we calculate the relevant one - loop matching coefficients including the new @xmath24 terms and collect all other results that feed into the cross section calculation .",
    "the second matching step from nrqcd to pnrqcd is discussed at length in section  [ sec : pnrqcd ] , since a coherent summary is not yet available in the literature . among the new results of this section",
    "are the path - integral derivation of the pnrqcd lagrangian ( neglecting ultrasoft gluons ) , the @xmath24 terms of the one - loop potentials , and a discussion on the non - renormalization of currents in the nrqcd to pnrqcd matching .",
    "pnrqcd perturbation theory in the pole - mass scheme provides a poor approximation to the top - quark pair production cross section near threshold .",
    "the top quark decay width is obviously an important effect , as is the conversion from the pole mass renormalization scheme that is employed in the primary calculations to renormalization schemes that absorb large corrections into the mass counterterm , which is a prerequisite for reliable perturbative calculations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a resummation of pnrqcd perturbation theory for the green function is necessary in the vicinity of the bound state poles despite the sizeable top quark width .",
    "these refinements will be explained in paper ii . in section  [ sec : master ] we conclude paper i by providing the master formula for the computation of the third - order cross section in pnrqcd .",
    "in this section we present the relation of the pair production cross section to correlation functions of heavy quark currents together with the arguments , why this relation holds true at nnnlo .",
    "we review the scales and momentum regions relevant to the problem both of which are central to the systematics of the effective theory approach .",
    "the basic top pair production mechanisms in @xmath0 annihilation are shown in the upper part of figure  [ fig : eett ] . since we work to lowest order in the electromagnetic and electroweak couplings , the optical theorem allows us to relate the total cross section @xmath43 of the process @xmath44 to the two point functions of the vector and axial - vector heavy quark current .",
    "we define @xmath45 for the vector current @xmath46 and the axial vector current @xmath47 .",
    "the cross section is then given by @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the high - energy limit of the @xmath50 production cross section , @xmath51 the center - of - mass energy squared , and @xmath52 the @xmath34-boson mass .",
    "@xmath53 denotes the top quark electric charge in units of positron charge and @xmath54 is the electromagnetic coupling . the vector and axial - vector couplings of fermion @xmath55 to the @xmath34-boson",
    "are given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 the weak mixing angle , @xmath58 the electric charge of fermion @xmath55 and @xmath59 its third component of the weak isospin .",
    "the dominant production mechanism is through the coupling to the virtual photon .",
    "the vector coupling of the @xmath34-boson increases the photon - mediated cross section by only about 8% in the threshold region @xmath60 .",
    "the axial - vector contribution is even smaller , since the axial coupling is suppressed near threshold by the small velocity of the top quarks .",
    "@xmath61 contributes to ( [ eq : sigtt ] ) only at nnlo relative @xmath62 .",
    "( [ eq : sigtt ] ) which relates the inclusive top cross section to the spectral functions of heavy - quark currents is not exact .",
    "there exist top production mechanisms , shown in the lower part of figure [ fig : eett ] , which are not captured by the heavy - quark current correlation functions , since the photon or @xmath34-boson couples to light quarks .",
    "vice versa , there exist cuts contributing to @xmath63 related to annihilation subdiagrams , see figure  [ fig : annihilation ] below , which do not contain top quarks and hence should be excluded .",
    "we shall discuss in the next subsection that these contributions are either highly suppressed and not relevant at third order , or can easily be included .",
    "the characteristic non - relativistic energy in threshold production is much smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "we define @xmath19 and the top quark `` velocity '' @xmath65 .",
    "this is related to another often used velocity parameter @xmath66 by @xmath67 real values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 should be interpreted with a @xmath70 prescription .",
    "we will extensively use another variable @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 here and below @xmath13 without any argument denotes the strong coupling in the @xmath73 scheme @xcite at the renormalization scale @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the value of @xmath71 determines when resummation to all orders in @xmath13 is necessary . above threshold ,",
    "the variable @xmath71 is purely positive - imaginary , below threshold it is real and positive .",
    "the threshold region is characterized by an absolute value of @xmath71 of order 1 or larger . in particular , the coulomb bound state poles are found at positive integer values of @xmath71 .",
    "conventional fixed - order perturbation theory can be used only when @xmath76 . as will be discussed later the width of the top quark",
    "is accounted for by substituting @xmath77 .",
    "thus , as @xmath69 varies from @xmath78 to @xmath79 the variable @xmath71 sweeps through a curve in the complex plane that begins at the origin , moves out into the first quadrant into the direction of the positive real axis and returns to the origin from above near the imaginary axis .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath71 along this curve is always smaller than @xmath80 , which is about 1.2 for top quarks , with @xmath81 , but since it reaches order one in the threshold region , the perturbation expansion in @xmath13 breaks down and resummation is necessary .      near the heavy - quark pair production threshold only a small kinetic energy @xmath82 is available to the final state . in the natural frame where @xmath83",
    "this implies that the typical three momentum of a heavy quark is of order @xmath84 ( about 20  gev for top quarks ) , while the energy and momentum of any other nearly massless particle can at most be @xmath85 ( about 2  gev for tops ) .",
    "the presence of several small scales propagates into the loop diagrams that contribute to the spectral functions and causes a breakdown of the standard perturbation expansion in the strong coupling @xmath13 .",
    "however , since @xmath12 is small one does not have to compute the loop integrals exactly  an expansion in @xmath12 suffices .",
    "this leads to a reorganized expansion as shown in ( [ systematics ] ) , in which @xmath13 and @xmath12 are expansion parameters but @xmath86 or , equivalently , @xmath71 is of order one .    for a given feynman diagram",
    "the expansion in @xmath12 can be constructed without first computing the full expression using the threshold expansion @xcite .",
    "the method uses that every diagram is the sum of terms , for which each loop momentum is in one of the following four regions : @xmath87 when on - shell , only massless particles ( gluons , light quarks and ghosts ) can be ultrasoft , and only the heavy quarks can be potential . in each region , the loop integrand is expanded in the terms which are small in the corresponding region and the loop integration of the expanded integrand is carried out over the complete @xmath33-dimensional space - time volume .",
    "the expansion generates ultraviolet and infrared divergences which are regulated dimensionally ( @xmath88 ) and subtracted according to the @xmath73 prescription .",
    "however , the divergences generated by the separation of the diagram into regions cancel in the sum over all terms .",
    "the procedure just described is largely equivalent to constructing appropriate effective lagrangians within dimensional regularization , but it clarifies the correct matching procedure which is subtle in dimensional regularization if the effective theory contains more than one scale as is the case in non - relativistic qcd @xcite .",
    "the threshold expansion also synthesizes the non - relativistic velocity power counting rules developed for the different modes ( momentum regions ) in @xcite . in the construction of the non - relativistic and resummed expansion of the pair production cross section we derive effective lagrangians in two steps by integrating out the large momentum modes according to the following scheme :    @xmath89 \\quad & \\mu >",
    "m \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\big\\downarrow & \\\\[0.3 cm ] { \\cal l}_{\\rm nrqcd}\\,[q(s , p),\\,g(s , p , us ) ] \\quad &   m v < \\mu < m \\\\[0.3 cm ] \\big\\downarrow & \\\\[0.3 cm ] { \\cal l}_{\\rm pnrqcd}\\,[q(p),\\,g(us ) ] \\quad & \\mu",
    "< m v\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in square brackets we display the modes of the heavy quarks ( @xmath90 ) and massless particles ( @xmath91 ) which are still contained in the effective lagrangian ; the others are integrated out when the energy cut - off @xmath74 is lowered as indicated on the right .",
    "the first step leads to nrqcd  @xcite , in which all interactions are local , since only the short - distance hard modes have been eliminated .",
    "the expansion rules of the threshold expansion _ define _ the dimensionally regularized nrqcd lagrangian .",
    "the second step whereby soft modes and potential massless modes are integrated out was suggested in @xcite in the context of the effective lagrangian and threshold expansion method .",
    "the result is the potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd ) lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the pnrqcd lagrangian is not local .",
    "it contains spatially non - local but temporally local , i.e. instantaneous interactions of the heavy quarks , since the three - momentum of the potential heavy quark field still present in pnrqcd is of the same order as the one of the modes integrated out .",
    "these interactions provide a precise definition of the concept of `` heavy - quark potentials '' .",
    "perturbation theory in pnrqcd resembles quantum - mechanical perturbation theory closely , since the leading colour - coulomb interaction is part of the unperturbed theory .",
    "thus , the propagator of pnrqcd includes the leading coulomb interaction exactly , which effects the required resummation of conventional perturbation theory to all orders .    to illustrate the velocity scaling of feynman diagrams , we consider the power counting for the loop integrand .",
    "( [ eq : scales ] ) implies that the integration measure @xmath92 scales as @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , when @xmath97 is hard , soft , potential and ultrasoft , respectively .",
    "the denominator of a gluon ( massless ) propagator with momentum @xmath98 is approximated at leading order in a given region by : @xmath99 \\displaystyle -\\frac{1}{\\bm{\\ell}^2}+\\ldots & \\mbox {   potential } ( v^{-2 } ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the velocity scaling is given in brackets .",
    "for the heavy - quark propagator with momentum @xmath100 the denominators are : @xmath101 \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2 m}\\,\\frac{1}{\\ell^0 } + \\ldots & \\mbox {   soft } ( v^{-1 } ) \\\\[0.5 cm ] \\displaystyle",

    "it will become clear from the later systematic derivation that the relevant diagrams are the ladder diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : ladder ] , and that the dominant term in the velocity expansion arises from the loop momentum region when all loop momenta are in the potential region .",
    "adding an additional rung to the ladder adds one potential gluon ( @xmath102 ) and two potential heavy - quark propagators ( @xmath103 ) to the diagram .",
    "the numerator of the diagram contains no velocity suppression factors , hence accounting for the potential loop measure ( @xmath95 ) and strong coupling from the two additional vertices ( @xmath104 ) , we find that each rung provides a factor of order @xmath86 , which is unsuppressed in the threshold region .",
    "it will be seen below that only potential gluon exchange generates this @xmath105 enhancement , which is equivalent to the statement that only the leading coulomb interaction must be included in the unperturbed effective lagrangian .",
    "we now return to the discussion of heavy - quark production mechanisms not captured by ( [ eq : sigtt ] ) , which expresses the cross section in terms of the heavy - quark current spectral functions . in the case of heavy - quark radiation ( lower left in figure  [ fig : eett ] ) the final state consists of @xmath106 , and since the available energy at threshold is limited to @xmath85 , the light quarks must be ultrasoft . in the three - loop diagram that represents the square of the heavy - quark radiation amplitude ,",
    "the @xmath107 loop must be potential and the two other loops ultrasoft , which leads to a factor of @xmath108 from the loop integration measure .",
    "the intermediate gluon and light - quark propagators in the amplitude must be hard to produce the @xmath107 pair and hence do not contribute inverse powers of @xmath12 .",
    "the two potential heavy quark and the two ultrasoft light quark propagators ( @xmath109 ) supply a factor of @xmath102 each , so the heavy - quark radiation contribution to the cross section scales at least as @xmath110 which should be compared to @xmath12 for the leading term .",
    "inspection of the analytic expression @xcite confirms this result , hence this contribution can be safely neglected . in the case of singlet production",

    "thus , at nnnlo , we can restrict ourselves to the four - fermion operators generated by hard quark anti - quark scattering .",
    "for this reason we write the operators in the `` scattering ordering '' @xmath200 rather than the `` annihilation ordering '' @xmath201 .",

    "the wilson lines cancel , and the @xmath582 terms in ( [ usterms ] ) can be dropped . with @xmath583 , and @xmath584 for ultrasoft gluon fields , it follows that the chromoelectric dipole interaction is suppressed by @xmath167 relative to the kinetic term in the action .",

    "it also turns out to be convenient to revert the derivation of the pnrqcd ultrasoft interaction ( [ usterms ] ) and to instead use the nrqcd vertices .",
    "the reason for this is that the derivation of ( [ usterms ] ) uses the pnrqcd equation of motion , which reshuffles the loop expansion , and employs four - dimensional identities @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between uv divergences in the ultrasoft calculation and ir divergences in the potential and hard matching calculations is more directly seen at the level of nrqcd diagrams , and the correct evaluation of the finite terms requires the consistent use of dimensional regularization in every loop order .",
    "the uv divergences arise from the integral over the three - momentum @xmath589 of the ultrasoft gluon , and from the subsequent potential loop integrations .",
    "the former divergence is related to the factorization of the ultrasoft scale from the other scales , and cancels when all pieces of the calculation are added .",
