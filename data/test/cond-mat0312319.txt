    "thin thickness structures exist widely in nature .",
    "many things such as eggs , snails , airplanes and so on in our daily life are covered with solid shells that play protective roles . in the realm that we can not see with naked eyes , virus usually have protein shells , and eukaryotic cells are enclosed by cell membranes that consist of lipids , proteins and carbohydrates etc .",
    "a lipid molecule has a polar hydrophilic head group and one or two hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails .",
    "when a quantity of lipid molecules disperse in water , they will assemble themselves into a lipid bilayer in which the hydrophilic heads shield the hydrophobic tails from the water surroundings because of the hydrophobic forces .",
    "solid shells and lipid bilayers are , respectively , in the categories of hard condensed matter and soft one .",
    "their mechanical properties have attracted much attention for a long time @xcite .",
    "the significant difference between solid shells and lipid bilayers is that the former can endure the in - plane shear stress but the latter can not .",
    "due to this difference , solid shells and lipid bilayers have different forms of deformation energy . under the assumption of homogenous and isotropic bulk materials and in the limit of thin thickness",
    ", the elastic free energy per unit area of a solid shell is expressed as @xcite : @xmath0\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{c}{2(1-\\nu^2)}\\left[(2j)^2 - 2(1-\\nu)q \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are bending rigidity and in - plane stiffness of the shell .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the young s modulus , the poisson ratio and the thickness of the shell . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the trace and determinant of the in - plane strain tensor , respectively . for a spherical solid shell with radius @xmath8 , the critical osmotic pressure ( i.e. , the pressure difference between the outer surface and inner one of the shell , above which the shell loses its stability ) is @xcite : @xmath9    in 1973 , helfrich @xcite recognized that the lipid bilayer was just like liquid crystal in smectic a phase at room temperature .",
    "based on the elastic theory of liquid crystal @xcite , he proposed the curvature energy per unit area of the bilayer @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are elastic constants ; and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are mean curvature , guassian curvature and spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayer , respectively . for phospholipid bilayers at room temperature @xmath16 , the persistence length is usually much larger than the size of the membranes and the effect of shape fluctuations is negligible @xcite because of @xmath17j@xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the boltzmann factor .",
    "the free energy of a closed bilayer under the osmotic pressure @xmath20 is written as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the area element and @xmath23 the volume enclosed by the closed bilayer .",

    "therefore , lipid bilayer is , indeed , much softer than solid shell .    are there membranes intermediate in the state between helfrich s fluid lipid bilayers and classical solid shells ?",
    "the polymer vesicles discussed below may be as a example . in the last decade",

    "the capsules composed of about 10 layers of alternating polystyrene sulfonate and polyallylamine hydrochloride .",
    "the thickness @xmath5 of capsules was about tens of nanometers which was remarkably less than their radii @xmath8 ( several micrometers ) .",
    "_ @xcite found that the spherical polyelectrolyte capsule lost its stability and changed its shape abruptly above some threshold of osmotic pressure @xmath30 which was proportional to @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in their experiment ,",
    "the thickness dependence of @xmath30 might not be exact because the polyelectrolyte capsule with more than 10 layers was chemically instable as they claimed .",
    "they also explained their results through the stability theory of classical elastic solid shells @xcite .",
    "but it is well known that the classical theory is based on the assumption of homogenous and isotropic bulk materials which entirely ignores the characteristic of the polyelectrolyte capsule consisting of many polymers .",
    "if considering the polymer structures of spherical polyelectrolyte capsule , can we still derive @xmath33 ?",
    "in this paper , we will answer above questions . to do that",
    ", we derive the entropy of a polymer confined in a curved surface and the elastic free energy of a membrane consisting of polymers by scaling analysis .",
    "it is found that the elastic free energy of the polymer membrane has the form of the in - plane strain energy plus helfrich s curvature energy .",
    "the elastic constants in the free energy are obtained by discussing two simplified models : one is the polymer membrane without in - plane strains and asymmetry between its two sides , which is the counterpart of quantum mechanics in curved surface @xcite ; another is the planar rubber membrane with homogeneous in - plane strains .",
    "the equations to describe equilibrium shape and in - plane strains of polymer vesicles by osmotic pressure are derived by taking the first order variation of the total free energy containing the elastic free energy , the surface tension energy and the term induced by osmotic pressure .",
    "the critical pressure , above which a spherical polymer vesicle will lose its stability , is obtained by taking the second order variation of the total free energy .",

    "it is hard to derive its free energy in a strict way .",
    "but we can drive it by using scaling concepts in polymer physics proposed by de gennes @xcite . in the following contents ,",
    "we take de gennes convention : the entropy @xmath34 is a dimensionless quantity and boltzmann factor @xmath19 is implicated in temperature @xmath16 .",
    "if we take the gaussian chain model @xcite , the root of mean square end - to - end distance of a polymer is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is segment length of the polymer and @xmath37 is the number of segments .",
    "assume that the principal radii of the surface are much larger than @xmath38 .",
    "if the in - plane strain tensor of the surface is denoted by @xmath39 which is assumed to be a small quantity , the entropy of the polymer confined the surface must be the function of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 because it is a dimensionless invariant quantity under the transformation of coordinates , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mean curvature of the surface , the gaussian curvature of the surface , the trace of strain tensor and the determinant of strain tensor , respectively .",
    "thus we can expand it as @xmath44 up to the second order terms , where @xmath45 are constants . in this expression ,",
    "an unimportant constant term is neglected .",
    "moreover , one must notice that generally we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 . additionally , there is no first order term of @xmath6 in the expression of the entropy because we expect that @xmath48 plays the same role as @xmath39 in the entropy .",

    "<S> the critical pressure , above which spherical polymer vesicle will lose its stability , is obtained by taking the second order variation of the total free energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the in - plane mode also plays important role in the critical pressure because it couples with the out - of - plane mode . </S>",
