    "fractional quantum hall effect is observed in high - mobility two - dimensional electron systems at low temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic field as the interactions between the electrons induce a gap in the bulk , and the transverse conductance is quantized universally as @xmath0 with certain rational numbers @xmath1 .",
    "each filling fraction @xmath1 possesses quasiparticle excitations with characteristic fractional charge and statistics .",
    "recently , there has been a major technological interest in suspected non - abelian phases , in particular at filling fraction @xmath2 , the quasiparticle properties of which could proposedly be applied in topologically protected quantum gates , robust against decoherence and local perturbations @xcite .",
    "the ongoing experimental studies of the statistics of the @xmath3 state make use of quantum point contacts @xcite , in which the electrons are confined away from the tunneling region .",
    "however , experiments suggest that as the quantum point contact shrinks in size , the @xmath3 state eventually becomes unstable . engineering the form of the confinement potential as to stabilize the non - abelian state in the quantum point contact region could therefore prove advantageous .    in this paper",
    ", we find the confinement potentials that maximize the overlap of the wave function of a few electron quantum hall droplet with the laughlin state at @xmath4 @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the moore - read state on the lowest landau level ( lll ) @xcite @xmath8 and on the second lowest landau level ( sll ) .",
    "the latter is obtained by applying the landau level raising operator @xmath9 to each electron coordinate in @xmath10 and assuming the lowest landau level of both spin types completely filled and inert .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "the model and the optimization method is explained in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the results and section 4 the summary .",
    "the system is modelled by an effective - mass hamiltonian @xmath11 +   \\sum_{i < j } \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon r_{ij}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number of electrons , and @xmath13 is the vector potential of the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath14 perpendicular to the sample plane .",
    "the material dependent parameters are @xmath15 , the effective mass of an electron , and @xmath16 ( cgs ) , the dielectric constant of gaas semiconductor medium . the confinement potential is expanded as @xmath17 where the last term is motivated by the form of the single - particle basis .",
    "@xmath18 is set to the maximum single - particle angular momentum ( finite for a fixed total angular momentum ) , and @xmath19 is the landau level index .",
    "@xmath20 are the generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the optimal parameters @xmath23 are searched by a random walk whereby new value is accepted whenever the resulting overlap is higher .    in the calculations",
    ", we set the confinement strength @xmath24 to @xmath25 as its scaling should merely shift the ranges of magnetic fields for different phases .",
    "lengths are written in units of oscillator length @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the lowest energy state of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) with given angular momentum is solved by performing lanczos diagonalization for the many - body hamiltonian matrix constructed in the basis of a spin - polarized fock - darwin band corresponding to fixed @xmath19 .",
    "this constitutes a landau level projection , an approximation that is valid at the high magnetic field regime and for small enough deviation from the ideal parabolic potential .",
    "the single - particle wave functions at fock - darwin band @xmath19 and angular momentum quantum number @xmath29 are written in oscillator units as @xmath30 the many - body hamiltonian is written in second quantized formalism as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the single - particle energies in absence of the optimization potential and @xmath33 are calculated analytically for the two lowest landau levels ( see appendix ) .",
    "the non - trivial quantities are the interaction matrix elements @xmath34 , which are calculated utilizing tsiper s analytic formula @xcite .    in the light of the numerical study @xcite and the recent tunneling experiment @xcite",
    ", it seems plausible that the landau level mixing , which breaks the particle - hole symmetry , favors the particle - hole conjugated moore - read state termed the anti - pfaffian @xcite .",
    "the potential could then be optimized in similar fashion for anti - pfaffian or any other candidate state .",
    "the obtained optimal overlaps are shown in table [ ol ] . for the laughlin state , the initial overlaps are in general the highest , yet the lack of overlap decreases on average by 68 % . in the lowest landau level ,",
    "the initial overlaps of the moore - read are quite modest but average 63 % cut in the lack of overlap makes a notable increase . on the second lowest landau level the cut averages at about 84 % and the overlaps are even higher .",
    "similarly increased overlaps have been reported earlier for modified coulomb interactions whereby thickness or screening is added @xcite .    however , the relevance of few electron results for moderately large electron numbers remains uncertain .",
    "firstly , the smaller the droplet , the larger the finite size effects .",
    "even if the overlap is quite low , the state may still belong to the same topological phase as the trial wave function . secondly , despite the high overlap the new state could be energetically instable relative to states with different angular momentum than that of the trial wave function .",
    "extrapolation of the actual ground state to larger particle numbers then yields an instability to another filling fraction or a compressible state .",
    "alternatively , one might therefore try to maximize the excitation gap of the ground state phase keeping only a moderate overlap with the trial state .",
    ".the initial and optimized overlaps for the @xmath35 laughlin state and the moore - read state at @xmath36 and @xmath2 with @xmath12 electrons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the modified potentials and their effect to the electron densities are presented in figure [ kuva ] .",
    "the potentials are shifted by a constant as to ensure that @xmath37 at @xmath38 . as seen in figure [ kuva](a),(e ) , and ( i ) , the difference to the clean parabolic potential reduces as the particle number is increased .",
    "this is likely to be related to smoothening of the electronic density as the particle number is increased . in the second landau level",
    "there are more fluctuations in the optimized potentials , since the basis function there contain the first non - trivial generalized laguerre polynomial factor leading to an additional maximum in the single particle densities .",
    "looking at the electronic densities in fig .",
    "[ kuva ] , the improvement in densities is clearly visible in all cases except for fig .",
    "[ kuva](f ) . note , however , that due to the disc geometry , the optimal densities tend to be more optimal near the edge of the droplet where most of the density is accumulated .    for the potentials optimized for the laughlin state , in fig .",
    "[ kuva](a ) , a common feature is the sharpness of the potential compared to the parabolic potential near the edge of the droplet ( see fig .",
    "[ kuva](b - d ) ) around @xmath39 .",
    "as noted in earlier works @xcite , this compression leads to a renormalization of the tunneling exponent @xcite characterizing the non - ohmic charge transport to the fractional quantum hall edge . in this case",
    ", the increase in the initially high overlaps seems marginal but the experimental consequences may not be .    for the moore - read state in the lowest landau level , the resulting densities ( fig .",
    "[ kuva](f - h ) ) match the trial density almost as well as for the laughlin state despite the notably lower initial overlaps .",
    "the form of the potential near the edge is again slightly sharper than a parabolic .",
    "a remarkable improvement occurs in the lowest landau level for 8 electrons ( fig .",
    "[ kuva](h ) ) where the overlap climbs up to 0.974 .",
    "this raises question , whether filling fraction @xmath36 state with pfaffian wave function ( eq .",
    "( [ pfaffian ] ) ) could be realized in a suitably tuned quantum hall droplet .",
    "our preliminary analysis , however , indicates that the obtained state is instable against higher angular momentum states and thus not immediately realized as the ground state .",
    "however , if slight variations of the potential landscape are still allowed without destroying the state , not to mention a larger droplet with more electrons , this instability might be surmountable . a lowest landau level non - abelian state would be especially welcome since the landau level mixing",
    "could then be well neglected ,    in the second lowest landau level , the moore - read state attains even larger overlaps and the densities seem to match reasonably well ( fig .",
    "[ kuva](j)-(l ) ) . however , the form of the optimal potentials is a bit more complicated with oscillatory behaviour .",
    "we have calculated the confinement potentials that maximize the wave functional overlap of a few electron droplet with the @xmath35 lauglin state and the moore - read state at @xmath36 and @xmath3 .",
    "the overlaps were found to increase clearly , particularly for the larger electron numbers , and the obtained electron densities matched well with the fluctuations of the trial densities .",
    "the laughlin state and the moore - read state in lowest landau level favored a sharpened potential near the edge of the droplet .",
