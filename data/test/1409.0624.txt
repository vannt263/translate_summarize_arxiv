    "this paper is devoted to the survival analysis of a system subject to competing failure modes within an external stressing environment .",
    "the external environment is assumed to stress the system at random and isolated times according to a random shock model .",
    "such a model can represent external demands e.g. , which put some stress on the system at their arrivals .",
    "shock models have been the subject of an extensive literature .",
    "following @xcite , shock models may be classified into different categories , according to whether arrival times and shock magnitudes are correlated @xcite , or independent @xcite , and according to the assumption put on the shocks arrival process : homogeneous or non - homogeneous poisson process @xcite , renewal process @xcite or non - stationary pure birth process @xcite .",
    "according to the influence of shocks on the system , shock models may be further classified into three types : extreme shock models ( a shock can cause the system immediate failure , see @xcite ) , cumulative shock models ( a shock increases some intrinsic characteristic of the system such as its deterioration , failure rate , age , number of already endured shocks , ... , see @xcite ) and mixed shock models ( a shock can either cause the system immediate failure or increase some intrinsic characteristic , see @xcite ) .",
    "more references can be found in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .    in this paper , a shock model with mixed effects",
    "is considered , where the occurrence of shocks is classically modelled through a non - homogeneous poisson process and where each shock may result in the system immediate failure through a bernoulli trial , independent of the system intrinsic behaviour .",
    "apart from shocks , the system suffers from competing soft and sudden failures , where soft failures refer to the reaching of some given threshold for the degradation level , and sudden failures to accidental failures , characterized by a failure rate .",
    "a possible representation corresponds to a two - component series system , where the first component is subject to soft failures and the second one to sudden failure .",
    "the system may hence fail through three different competing modes : traumatic failure due to a fatal shock ; soft failure ; sudden failure .",
    "each non fatal shock induces some increase of both deterioration level and failure , with possible dependence in - between .    in the oldest literature , most models considered one single possible type of failures for the system : e.g. soft failures in @xcite or traumatic failures due to shocks in @xcite , both in the multivariate setting .",
    "more recently , different models have been developed , which consider two different types of failures .",
    "for instance , competition between soft and sudden failures is studied in @xcite .",
    "several application cases are proposed in the paper ( see also references therein ) .",
    "an industrial example is also provided in @xcite , which studies the reliability of an aircraft engine .",
    "note that @xcite assumes soft and sudden failures to be independent whereas the stressing environment of the present paper makes them dependent .",
    "competition between soft failures and occurrence of a traumatic event are considered in degradation - threshold - shock models ( dts - models , denomination of @xcite ) which have been proposed by @xcite and further studied by @xcite .",
    "a case study is provided in @xcite for the analysis of fatigue crack growth , where the effects of shocks on the degradation are put into evidence .",
    "note that , contrary to the present paper , dts - models consider some possible influence of the deterioration level of the system on the shocks arrival rate .",
    "however , the first shock of a dts - model is always fatal to the system ( leading to a single shock possibly endured by the system ) , whereas successive non fatal shocks are here envisioned .",
    "we could not find any paper which takes into account three competing failure modes , as in the present paper .",
    "however , based on the case studies from the previous literature , one can think that our model can reflect lots of systems subject to competing soft and hard failures , within a stressing environment .",
    "for instance , one can think of an aerial cabin hooked to a cable : the supporting cable is deteriorating due to corrosion and fatigue ; the linking pulley is subject to sudden failures ( and maybe also to deterioration ) ; both cable and pulley endure shocks at each cabin travel , which increase jointly their respective deterioration level and failure rate .",
    "the present paper consider several kinds of dependence between the three competing failure modes : at each non fatal shock , the increase of deterioration and failure rate is simultaneous .",
    "this induces a first type of dependence between soft and sudden failures .",
    "each shock may induce a failure , either because the shock is fatal , or because the deterioration is suddenly increased beyond the threshold level .",
    "this induces a second type of dependence between soft and traumatic failures , which may be simultaneous .",
    "also , some possible dependence is envisioned between the increments of failure rate and of deterioration at each non fatal shock .",
    "this induces a third type of dependence between soft and sudden failures . finally , following @xcite , the probability for a shock to be fatal depends on the shock arrival time , which induces a last type of dependence . up to our knowledge , all these kinds of dependence have not been yet considered altogether and , as will be seen all along the text , this model enlarges several ones from the previous literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is specified in section [ model ] .",
    "the system reliability is computed through different methods in section 3 .",
    "sufficient conditions are provided in section 4 * *  * * for the system lifetime to be new better than used .",
    "the influence of various parameters of the shock environment on the lifetime is studied in section 5 .",
    "numerical experiments are proposed in section [ section num ] and concluding remarks end the paper in section [ concl ] .",
    "to make the model clear , a two - component series system is considered , where the first component is subject to sudden failure and the second one to soft failure .",
    "this two - unit system is just a representation for the competing soft and sudden failure modes , with no restriction . in the ideal condition ( for example in a laboratory environment ) , the lifetime of the first component is characterized by its intrinsic hazard rate @xmath0 , @xmath1 while the second one is subject to some accumulative deterioration modeled by an increasing stochastic process @xmath2 ( e.g. a gamma process ) .",
    "the second component fails once its deterioration level exceeds a failure threshold @xmath3 .",
    "the lifetimes of the two components are made dependent by their common stressing environment .",
    "this environment is modelled by a random shock process , where the shocks arrive according to a non - homogeneous poisson process @xmath4 with intensity @xmath5 ( or cumulated intensity @xmath6 ) . to avoid useless technical details , we assume that @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "more generally , one might consider that @xmath7 only for @xmath9 greater than some @xmath10 , which would mean that the shocks would arrive only after time @xmath11 .",
    "the points of the poisson process are denoted by @xmath12 , ... , @xmath13 , ... with @xmath14 almost surely . a shock at time @xmath9 may cause the system immediate failure ( fatal shock ) with probability @xmath15 $ ] , which depends on the age @xmath9 of the system at the shock arrival .",
    "a shock at time @xmath9 is non fatal with probability @xmath16 . a non fatal shock at time @xmath17 increases the deterioration of both components in a different way :    * for the first component , its hazard rate is increased of a non negative random amount @xmath18 , * for the second one",
    ", its accumulated deterioration is increased of a non negative random amount @xmath19 .",
    "the random vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ... are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with common distribution @xmath23 , and independent of the shocks arrival times @xmath24 ( and hence independent of the poisson process @xmath4 ) . at each shock ,",
    "the increments @xmath18 and @xmath19 are possibly dependent .",

    "is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "we set @xmath30 to be the bivariate compound poisson process defined by @xmath31 with@xmath32where @xmath33 .    the processes @xmath34 and @xmath2 are assumed to be independent .",
