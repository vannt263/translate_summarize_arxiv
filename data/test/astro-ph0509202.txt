    "the study of galaxy formation and evolution requires detailed information about statistically significant samples of dim objects .",
    "this , in turn , requires deep imaging and spectroscopy over wide areas of the sky . in pursuit of these data ,",
    "several wide - deep surveys are now underway .",
    "those covering several square degrees or more either lack spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. noao dwfs , @xcite , and odts , @xcite ) or are restricted to the study of objects at @xmath9 ( except for quasars ) by their imaging depth e.g. the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite and @xcite ) , the virmos - vlt deep survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) and deep2 @xcite .",
    "other surveys target the high - redshift universe with deep hst imaging over fractions of a square degree i.e. the hubble deep fields @xcite , the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) , goods @xcite , and gems @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic coverage is feasible over these areas but is presently unable to probe deeper than @xmath10 , making the added imaging depth useful only for morphological studies and photometric redshifts .",
    "the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ) probes the intermediate regime of a square degree of sky to the spectroscopic limit of @xmath10 .",
    "section 2 describes the design of our survey .",
    " 3 reports our imaging observations for the extended hubble deep field south .",
    " 4 describes our imaging reduction , and  5 covers our photometric calibration and photometry .",
    " 6 gives our results for @xmath4-band number counts and the sky density and angular clustering of @xmath6-selected lyman break galaxies .",
    " 7 concludes .",
    "our analyses assume a standard @xmath11cdm cosmology with @xmath12=0.27,@xmath13 , and @xmath14=70km / s / mpc .",
    "the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( see http://www.astro.yale.edu/musyc ) is designed to provide a fair sample of the universe for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central black holes .",
    "the core of the survey is a deep imaging campaign in optical and near - infrared passbands of four carefully selected @xmath15 fields .",
    "musyc is unique for its combination of depth and total area , for additional coverage at x - ray , uv , mid- and far - infrared wavelengths and for providing the @xmath16 photometry needed for high - quality photometric redshifts over a square - degree of sky .",
    "the primary goal is to study the properties and interrelations of galaxies at a single epoch corresponding to redshift @xmath17 , using a range of selection techniques .",
    "we chose to use the @xmath0 filter set in the optical in order to obtain six nearly - independent flux measurements with the broadest possible wavelength coverage .",
    "lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 are selected through their dropout in @xmath18-band images combined with blue continuua in @xmath19 ( @xmath20 in the rest - frame ) typical of recent star formation @xcite .",
    "imaging depths of @xmath18,@xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23 were chosen to detect the lbgs , whose luminosity function has a characteristic magnitude of @xmath24 in @xmath25 , and to find their lyman break decrement in the @xmath18 filter via colors @xmath26 .",
    "lyman @xmath27 emitters at @xmath5 are selected through additional deep narrow - band imaging using a 50 fwhm filter centered at 5000 .",
    "these objects can be detected in narrow - band imaging and spectroscopy by their emission lines , allowing us to probe to much dimmer continuum magnitudes than possible for lyman break galaxies .",
    "it has recently become clear that optical selection methods do not provide a full census of the galaxy population at @xmath28 , as they miss objects which are faint in the rest - frame ultraviolet @xcite . with this in mind , musyc has a comprehensive near - infrared imaging campaign .",
    "the nir imaging comprises two components : a wide survey covering the full square degree and a deep survey of the central @xmath29 of each field .",
    "this division between deep and wide was chosen because of the @xmath30 field - of - view of the ispi near - infrared camera on the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "the @xmath31 point source sensitivities of the wide and deep components are @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "nir imaging over the full survey area provides a critical complement to optical imaging for breaking degeneracies in photometric redshifts and modeling star formation histories .",
    "deeper @xmath34 imaging over @xmath29 subfields opens up an additional window into the @xmath35 universe as the @xmath36 selection technique @xcite will be used to find evolved optically - red galaxies at @xmath37 through their rest - frame balmer/4000 break .",
    "extensive follow - up spectroscopy is being conducted over the square degree .",
    "a subset of the color - selected lyman break galaxy candidates will turn out to be agn based on broad- or narrow - line emission features seen in follow - up spectroscopy @xcite . damped lyman @xmath27 absorption systems @xcite at @xmath38 , which comprise the neutral gas reservoir needed to form most of the stars in the universe @xcite ,",
    "will be searched for in the spectra of the brightest color - selected lbg / agn candidates ( typically quasars at @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition to the optical and near - infrared , imaging campaigns at other wavelengths and follow - up spectroscopy are integral parts of musyc .",
    "x - ray selection will be used to study agn demographics over the full range of accessible redshifts , @xmath39 , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with spitzer imaging used to detect optically- and x - ray - obscured agn @xcite .",
    "this also allows a census of accreting black holes at @xmath5 in the same fields to study correlations between black hole accretion and galaxy properties at this epoch .",
    "future epochs of optical imaging will be used to conduct a proper motion survey to find white dwarfs and brown dwarfs in order to study galactic structure and the local initial mass function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the additional epochs will also enable a variability study of agn .",
    "the four survey fields ( see table  [ tab : fields ] ) were chosen to have extremely low reddening , hi column density @xcite , and 100@xmath40 m dust emission @xcite in order to facilitate satellite coverage with spitzer , hst , chandra , and xmm , to take advantage of existing multiwavelength data and to enable flexible scheduling of observing time during the year .",
    "additionally , each field satisfies all of the following criteria : minimal bright foreground sources in the optical and radio , high galactic latitude ( @xmath41 ) to reduce stellar density , and accessibility from observatories located in chile .",
    "the survey fields will be a natural choice for future observations with alma .",
    "the remainder of this paper describes our optical images and catalog of e - hdfs .",
    "the techniques used for data reduction and photometry are the same as those used for the analysis of the other three fields . optical imaging from the full survey",
    "will be reported in e.  gawiser et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the near - infrared data will be discussed in r.  quadri et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the e - hdfs has deep public space - based observations at uv , optical , near - infrared , and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the hdfs itself covers a small @xmath42 central region with wfpc2 plus stis and nicmos regions , with deep ground - based jhk coverage of the wfpc2 region available from the fires survey @xcite .",
    "spitzer irac and mips coverage of the central @xmath43 is being performed in gto time .",
    "the extended area around hdfs has previously been imaged by @xcite and @xcite to a depth sufficient for the study of galaxies at @xmath44 .",
    "these images were made public and combined with deep h - band images by the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs , @xcite ) to study red galaxies out to @xmath45 .",
    "our survey goes about one magnitude deeper in ubvri@xmath46 to probe the @xmath2 universe .",
    "our extended hubble deep field south ( e - hdfs ) field center ( see table  [ tab : fields ] ) was chosen to keep a bright star ( m=6.8 ) which lies just north of the wfpc2 field off of the ctio+mosaic detectors .",
    "lcirs covered an h - shape centered on wfpc2 and thereby provides public @xmath47-band coverage of roughly half of our e - hdfs field .",
    "optical images of e - hdfs were taken on the nights of 2002 october 6,8,10,12 and 2003 may 26,27,28 using the 8192@xmath488192 pixel mosaic ii camera consisting of 8 2048@xmath484096 ccds , each with 2 amplifiers , on the blanco 4 m telescope at ctio .",
    "afternoon calibrations were obtained , including zero - second exposures to trace the readout bias pattern , and domeflats in each filter to be observed except for @xmath18 for which the counts from the dome lamps were insufficient .",
    "twilight flats were therefore obtained for the @xmath18 filter .",
    "dark exposures of comparable length to the imaging observations were obtained , but due to the negligible dark current they were not used for data reduction .",
    "a standard dither pattern was used to fill in gaps between the 8 ccds .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.267@xmath49/pixel , leading to coverage spanning @xmath50 of sky with each pointing .",
    "figure [ fig : filters ] shows the filter response curves and their multiplication with the ccd quantum efficiency and atmospheric transmission at one airmass .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] gives details of the exposure times in each filter for each run along with the approximate average seeing measured in the raw images during observations .",
    "the seven nights were mostly cloudless , but moderate clouds affected some of the @xmath22 imaging of e - hdfs on 2002 october 10,12 and some of the @xmath4 imaging on 2003 may 28 ; our reduction methods described below allow these images to be used without biasing the photometry .",
    "photometric standard fields from @xcite large enough to cover the full mosaic ii field of view were observed each night , and the nights of 2002 october 6 and 2003 may 26 proved photometric .",
    "@xmath0 images from ctio4m+mosaic ii were reduced using the mscred and mscdb packages in iraf v.2.12 following the noao deep wide field survey cookbook v.7.02 .",
    "we used custom software to work around a few difficulties in these packages , as described below .",
    "a composite zero image is subtracted from each raw image to remove the amplifier bias level and pattern .",
    "the resulting image is then `` flat - fielded '' by dividing by a composite domeflat , or a composite twilight flat in the case of @xmath18-band .",
    "superskyflat _ for each filter is made by combining all of the flat - fielded , unregistered images taken in each filter each night with rejection used to remove sources .",
    "our 2@xmath51 amplitude dither pattern was designed to eliminate the wings of bright sources from the _",
    "superskyflat_. each flat - fielded image is then divided by the appropriate _ superskyflat _ , which offers an estimate of the pixel - by - pixel response to the spectrum of the night sky with sufficient counts to achieve 1% precision per pixel . because the _ superskyflat _ was produced using flat - fielded images , dividing by it serves to remove the original domeflat ( twilight flat ) from the reduction process .",
    "the real influence of the original flat - fielding is to remove the illumination pattern and gross pixel - to - pixel variations before looking for cosmic rays and bright objects to reject in making the _ superskyflat_. using the _ superskyflat _ to correct for the pixel response is considered preferable to using the domeflat because the ccd response to the spectrum of the dome lamp ( or twilight sky ) can have significant systematic differences from its response to the spectrum of the night sky . for background - limited photometry , this is an important effect .",
    "we then find an astrometric solution for each image , starting with fiducial wcs headers provided for each fits extension of the raw images and comparing the claimed positions with the known positions of stars in the usno - b catalog using the mscred routine _",
    "msccmatch_. we found _ msccmatch _ to be finicky ; for some runs the fiducial headers were too inaccurate to be corrected with the maximum second - order terms used by the mscred package .",
    "an iterative , non - interactive procedure of calling _ msccmatch _ multiple times proved sufficient .",
    "the final rms astrometric errors are between 0.2@xmath49 and 0.3@xmath49 in each image , which is consistent with the uncertainties on individual usno - b stars despite having fit many more stars than free parameters , and the actual solution should be better than 0.2@xmath49 rms .    to perform aperture photometry later on ,",
    "our final images are transformed to have a common pixel scale and tangent plane projection point .",
    "this is accomplished by projecting each processed image ( after bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , _",
    "superskyflat_-fielding , and correction of wcs header information ) onto the tangent plane of a common reference image using _",
    "mscimage_. the reprojection performed by _ mscimage _ should be performed with flux conservation set to _ no _ the first time but then set to _ yes _ for any further reprojections .",
    "this is because the pixel scales in raw mosaic ii images are a function of radius from the field center with several percent variation from center to corner of the field .",
    "the process of flat - fielding removes the true illumination pattern caused by more photons falling in larger pixels leading to an illusion of flat background counts despite the variation in pixel scales .",
    "mscimage _ is used for astrometric projection into a uniformly sized grid of pixels , flux conservation would re - introduce the illumination pattern , thereby causing a variable photometric zeropoint across the image . turning off",
    "flux conservation instead produces an average of the values of initial pixels neighboring each final pixel location that offsets the error introduced by flat - fielding .",
    "we make three different stacked `` final '' images for each filter .",
    "unweighted versions are made first in order to determine the weights for the other two versions .",
    "the versions denoted by _",
    "xs _ were combined using weights optimized for surface brightness , which is the method used by the ndwfs cookbook .",
    "the versions denoted by _",
    "ps _ were made using weights optimized for point sources ; details can be found in the appendix . we synthesize a @xmath52__ps _",
    "image to use as our photometric detection image by adding the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath4 _ ps _ stacks using point - source - optimized weights derived from the signal and noise statistics of these stacks .",
    "we decided not to add @xmath18 to @xmath52 although it is also very deep because some low - redshift objects have different morphologies in @xmath18 , the seeing is typically worse in @xmath18 , and objects at @xmath5 will be nearly invisible in @xmath18 so adding it to @xmath52 would just add noise for these objects .",
    "note that for similar reasons objects that drop out in @xmath21 and @xmath22 are somewhat less likely to be detected in our @xmath52 image than in a @xmath53 or @xmath4 image alone .",
    "we prefer the @xmath52 approach to the creation of a @xmath54 image advocated by @xcite because it allows us to measure object morphological parameters directly from the same image used for object detection , which is not recommended in the latter approach .",
    "moreover , the optimally - weighted @xmath52 combination reduces the emphasis on single - filter outliers employed by the @xmath54 approach and avoids its flaw of treating both negative and positive sky fluctuations as evidence of an object .",
    "we trim the final @xmath52__ps _ image to the maximum size region that has nearly uniform signal - to - noise ratio in all three input images @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath4 . for e - hdfs ,",
    "the trimmed image is 7395@xmath487749 pixels or @xmath55 .",
    "then the iraf task _ imalign _ is used to shift and trim the other images to match , giving our images the common origin and size required for aperture photometry with sextractor .",
    "the trimmed images are normalized to an effective exposure time of one second . after the pipeline reduction",
    ", the background is flat to better than 1% in all filters .",
    "the remaining low level , large scale fluctuations were subtracted using sextractor @xcite with mesh size back_size=64 and median filter back_filtersize set to 6 mesh units .",
    "the resulting final @xmath52 image is shown in figure [ fig : bvr ] with a magnified image of a small section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] .",
    "new fits headers have been added to these final images indicating input information for sextractor photometry runs and other routines , specifically : + satur_level , the empirically determined saturation level in each image , which is usually a factor of a few less than the apparent saturation level of the brightest stars , + seeing_fwhm , the mode of the seeing for a set of bright unsaturated stars , + mag_zeropoint , the ab magnitude of an object that gives 1 count per second derived from photometric calibration as described below , + flux_zeropoint , the flux in @xmath40jy corresponding to 1 count per second , + tot_exptime , the total exposure time that each final image represents , and + gain_tot , the number of photoelectrons represented by each count in the final image .",
    "our calibration scheme is to take @xmath565 minute exposures of our fields ( referred to as `` calibration images '' ) in all optical filters on photometric nights .",
    "this was achieved for e - hdfs on oct .",
    "photometric calibration is performed using a version of the landolt catalog with all magnitudes and colors converted into the ab95 system of @xcite ( referred to throughout this paper as ab magnitudes ) .",
    "we included @xmath46 magnitudes for landolt standard stars in our catalog of standards using the formula @xmath57 which was generated from the formulae of @xcite and has been corrected for a 0.02 magnitude bias found when comparing this prediction with measurements of @xmath46 magnitudes of bright landolt stars by @xcite .",
    "the resulting 0.04 magnitude rms error was used to predict errors in these estimates .",
    "this procedure offers a significant reduction in observing time and a tremendous increase in the number of calibration stars versus the traditional method of using spectrophotometric standard stars for filters outside the johnson - cousins system .",
    "only a few stars per landolt field have been turned into sdss calibrators @xcite and they are typically too bright for the 4 m telescope to use without defocusing .",
    "table [ tab : photcal ] lists the airmass and seeing for each of our calibration images along with our photometric solution for the magntiude in terms of measured counts per second , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the magnitude zeropoint , @xmath60 is the airmass coefficient , @xmath61 is airmass , and the color term is listed in table [ tab : photcal ] .",
    "our images of landolt standard fields occupied a range of airmasses bracketing the airmasses of these calibration images but insufficient to break the degeneracy between zeropoint and airmass coefficient .",
    "we therefore used fixed airmass coefficients , with the resulting uncertainty reflected in the uncertainty in the zeropoint fit , which is @xmath621.5% in each filter . since ab95 was carefully calibrated for the standard johnson - cousins @xmath63 filter set , the conversion of the landolt catalog is quite accurate .",
    "however , the filter system used at ctio is not a precise match to johnson - cousins , making the use of a color term helpful in photometric calibration .",
    "the relatively small color coefficients shown in table [ tab : photcal ] minimize the scatter in our photometric solution by providing a better estimate of the true ab magnitude of each landolt star in our observed filter system .",
    "we set the ab color coefficient to zero when determining photometry for our final object catalog ; this places the fluxes on our observed filter system rather than standard johnson - cousins filters .",
    "a color correction can be calculated later for applications that require fluxes extrapolated to johnson - cousins colors . because photometric redshift codes multiply spectral templates by the atmospheric transmission , filter transmission , and ccd quantum efficiency used for the observations , they already account for the origin of the color term and",
    "should be given fluxes in the observed filter system .",
    "the presence of non - power - law features such as lyman and balmer breaks in these template spectra ( and real objects ) makes it desirable to avoid color transformations calibrated with stars .",
    "we then used the calibration images to create standard stars in each filter for e - hdfs and used these new standard stars to calculate the zeropoint in our final images .",
    "this avoids attempting to explicitly correct the photometry for the airmass and cirrus extinction in each image which contributed to our final images , allowing us to use images taken in non - photometric conditions as part of the final stack . for e - hdfs",
    "we used a set of 10 stars , each from a different original amplifier , chosen to be bright enough to provide good signal in @xmath18 and yet to avoid saturation in @xmath4 , @xmath64 , and @xmath46 .",
    "care was taken to choose some stars near the field center and some near the sides and corners of the field to check for systematic effects .",
    "the photometry of the new standards was determined using the iraf routine _",
    "phot_. we used the same @xmath65 diameter aperture for photometry of these standard stars in order to minimize aperture losses .",
    "we repeated this process by using _",
    "phot _ on our final science images for the same stars .",
    "we checked for systematic patterns in the offsets but found none , and the rms scatter was 0.03 magnitudes , implying a smaller error in the mean offset .",
    "the total exposure time , seeing , photometric zeropoints , and 5 @xmath66 point source detection depths ( ab ) of our final images are given in table [ tab : final ] .",
    "flux zeropoints are also determined using the definition @xcite @xmath67 given the measured uncertainties in the initial zeropoints and our measured scatter in the solution for the zeropoints of the final images , we estimate a total systematic uncertainty of 3% in the zeropoint of each filter .",
    "derivations of optimal photometric techniques and their uncertainties typically assume poisson noise which is uncorrelated between image pixels . however , the astrometric reprojection used to place all images on a common grid correlates neighboring pixels , leaving the large - scale noise properties unchanged but making a pixel - by - pixel rms a poor measure of the typical noise due to sky fluctuations in a larger aperture . as this is the method used by sextractor to estimate photometric errors",
    ", we undertook a detailed investigation to test its accuracy , which turns out to be poor , and to find an improved method .",
    "our empirical method for estimating photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size is also sensitive to large - scale noise correlations from unsubtracted nearby objects and from any ccd defects that survive flat - fielding .",
    "wings from bright objects appear to affect the noise statistics ; when we set all pixels belonging to detected objects to zero and displayed the resultant image , wings are clearly visible around the brightest objects .",
    "we estimate the error due to background fluctuations and noise correlations in each filter via a custom idl code which places @xmath68 random apertures of a given size on the sky - subtracted image which do not overlap with any of the pixels in the segmentation map of isophotal object regions produced by sextractor .",
    "we use circular apertures of area @xmath69 centered at integer pixels and describe them by an effective size @xmath70 .",
    "a gaussian is then fit to the histogram of aperture fluxes to yield the rms background fluctuation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] .",
    "the histograms appear well described by the best - fit gaussians .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmav ] shows the rms of aperture fluxes vs. n for raw , sky - subtracted raw , and final @xmath22 images .",
    "the solid curve gives our fit to the noise properties of the final @xmath22 image using the function @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 for the measured rms pixel noise of @xmath74=0.014 .",
    "an alternative formula suggested by @xcite , @xmath75 yields an equally good fit , with @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this formula shows an explicit sum between contributions from poisson noise , which is independent from one pixel to another and hence has rms proportional to @xmath78 , and correlated noise from fluctuations in background level on scales larger than the aperture which yields an rms proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "these simple , extreme cases are shown as dotted lines starting from the value of @xmath80 in figure [ fig : sigmav ] and are seen to bracket the true behavior except at very small aperture sizes .",
    "apertures of just a few pixels in area are affected by the small - scale noise correlations introduced by re - pixelization performed during re - projection ; this effect should actually depress @xmath80 since each final pixel is the average over several nominally independent input pixels .",
    "we prefer the simplicity of eq .",
    "[ eq : power ] which reflects the reality that noise exists on a range of scales leading to an effective power - law behavior intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "table [ tab : noise ] lists our measured rms - per - pixel @xmath74 and the fit coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath81 for all of our filters ; the uncertainties in @xmath27 and @xmath81 are highly correlated but both have been determined to 5% precision , whereas the uncertainties in @xmath74 measurements are at the 1% level .",
    "a similar analysis of our raw images shown in figure [ fig : sigmav ] reveals that the noise in the raw images ( squares ) is fully correlated due to the domination of background fluctuations . once a sky - subtraction has been performed ( diamonds ) ,",
    "the noise properties resemble those of the final image except for being noisier by a factor roughly equal to the square root of the number of exposures .",
    "while some of this improvement comes from flat - fielding , it appears that the correlated noise is due to background fluctuations from objects whose subtraction improves with the square root of observing time .",
    "this is inconsistent with confusion noise from undetected sources , which is not expected to be a significant factor even in optical images this deep .",
    "one possibility for the origin of this correlated noise is that the global sky subtraction performed by sextractor is insufficient .",
    "however , when we mimic the backphoto_type local mode of sextractor by estimating the local sky in a square annulus around each aperture and subtracting this off we find a slight increase in the noise correlations .",
    "hence it appears that the background contributions from sky gradients and nearby objects have been subtracted about as well as one could expect , and that the remaining contributions increase the noise significantly above the extrapolation from @xmath74 one would assume for the case of uncorrelated noise .",
    "we wish to determine accurate photometry for a wide range of object sizes and brightnesses , with particular attention to high - redshift galaxies with half - light radii 0.2 - 0.3@xmath49 @xcite ) which are dim and typically unresolved in our @xmath82 seeing and can therefore be approximated as point sources .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that most galaxies at @xmath83 have half - light radii @xmath84 regardless of redshift . in traditional aperture photometry ,",
    "the flux of an object is measured by giving constant weight to one region of the image and zero weight to the rest , with fractional weights used for pixels which fall only partially in the chosen aperture .",
    "the simplest case is a circular aperture centered at the object centroid . for the case of uncorrelated noise dominated by the sky background and a gaussian psf ,",
    "the circular aperture with optimal signal - to - noise is easy to derive and has a diameter equal to 1.35 times the seeing fwhm .",
    "however , the actual psf in each filter has a near - gaussian core with broad wings i.e. more of the flux is found outside the fwhm than for a gaussian . to investigate the effect of the non - gaussian psf on photometry we measured the enclosed flux as a function of radius for a set of objects selected to be bright but unsaturated ( @xmath85 ) and unresolved according to sextractor ( @xmath86 , as discussed below ) .",
    "[ fig : psf ] shows the results for the @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath64 bands plus a gaussian of 0.96@xmath49 fwhm that represents an excellent fit to the core of the @xmath22-band psf but only encloses 80% of the total flux .",
    "a 14@xmath49 diameter aperture was used to define the total object flux , with rapid convergence seen in the bluer filters but only gradually in @xmath4,@xmath64 , and @xmath46 .",
    "while this could be due in part to contributions from neighboring objects , we used the median statistic to define these profiles to avoid sensitivity to the small fraction of objects with bright neighbors .",
    "the contribution of nearby objects should lead to a divergence with increasing aperture diameter which is not seen , so it appears that the psf wings do contain a higher fraction of the total flux in the redder bands , with perhaps a few percent missed by our 14@xmath49 diameter aperture .",
    "figure [ fig : sn ] plots the enclosed flux , the rms background fluctuation , and the resulting signal - to - noise for point sources as a function of aperture diameter .",
    "there are competing effects which serve to make the optimal aperture slightly smaller than the idealized result of 1.35 @xmath48 fwhm .",
    "the non - gaussian psf places more flux outside the `` optimal '' diameter , so a larger aperture would find more signal .",
    "however , the large - scale noise correlations mean that noise increases with aperture size faster than in the ideal poisson case .",
    "table [ tab : apertures ] lists various seeing measurements along with the optimal circular aperture diameters and fractional flux enclosed within these apertures for each filter which is used to correct the observed fluxes to estimate the total object flux in each filter .",
    "a systematic increase in the seeing occurs when the estimate is made using sextractor s _ fwhm _ parameter , which assumes a gaussian psf , instead of iraf s _ imexam _ routine , which allows a moffat fit .",
    "the non - gaussian psf shape is reflected in the further increase in the diameter containing half of the object light implied by the half - light radii @xmath87 output by sextractor ; a gaussian contains half of the flux within one fwhm .",
    "the optimal circular apertures for point sources turn out to be quite close to these values for the half - light radii .",
    "the image quality is measured to be nearly constant across the @xmath88 field , with systematic variations in fwhm and half - light radius seen at the 10% level in the @xmath64 band but at no more than the 5% level in the other filters .    for extended sources ,",
    "our apertures are no longer optimal , and the corrections for the fraction of enclosed flux are incorrect .",
    "these sources are barely affected by seeing smaller than their intrinsic size , leading to a flux better described by the aperture area than by the fractional enclosed point - source flux .",
    "the traditional solution is to use larger apertures ( @xmath89 diameter ) to measure colors of extended objects as well as point sources .",
    "our analysis shows that the signal - to - noise of point source photometry is reduced by up to 30% by using these larger apertures , with a bias in the @xmath90 color of point sources of 20% ( 0.2 magnitudes ) introduced by the different seeing in these images .",
    "this could be solved by convolving all of the images to the relatively poor seeing ( fwhm=1.3@xmath49 ) of the @xmath18 band ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the non - gaussian psf shape requires a non - gaussian convolution kernel ; simply matching the fwhm by gaussian convolution is not sufficient to fully match the psf .",
    "moreover , smoothing the other images to match the psf shape of the @xmath18 band would be costly in terms of decreasing the signal - to - noise for point source photometry , especially given the observed large - scale correlations in background noise .",
    "in choosing the `` optimal '' aperture sizes for each filter in table [ tab : apertures ] , we have chosen amongst the range of apertures with signal - to - noise@xmath9195% of the optimal value in a manner that reduces the range of aperture sizes in order to reduce the errors introduced for extended sources .",
    "this has the effect of choosing slightly larger apertures in the redder filters than would formally maximize the signal - to - noise .",
    "this provides additional benefits , as the approximations that high - redshift galaxies are point sources , image co - registration is perfect , and object positions have no error all become less valid as the apertures decrease in size .",
    "our simulations indicate that these combined effects will not affect object colors beyond the 10% level for the chosen aperture sizes .",
    "our primary solution to the challenge of obtaining decent colors for both unresolved and extended objects dimmer than the night sky is to create corrected aperture fluxes ( hereafter referred to as apcorr ) .",
    "we tried using the a_image and b_image parameters to model the flux distribution as an ellipsoid but encountered too many systematic problems with these parameters to prefer this approach .",
    "we therefore use the half - light radius ( flux_radius ) of each object determined by sextractor in the @xmath52 detection image and assume a two - dimensional gaussian light profile with twice this value as fwhm .",
    "the half - light radius measured in the @xmath52 detection image represents the object s intrinsic size convolved with the @xmath52 seeing , and this allows us to predict the observed size in each filter given the known seeing measured from the median half - light radii of bright point sources listed in table [ tab : apertures ] . for object @xmath92 in filter",

    "the fractional flux of object @xmath92 falling within the optimal circular aperture radius @xmath95 for filter @xmath93 listed in table [ tab : apertures ] is then assumed to be @xmath96 where the first value in parentheses refers to the fractional flux for point sources listed in table [ tab : apertures ] and the second gives the fractional flux of the two - dimensional gaussian which approximates the object .",
    "taking the minimum of these two values prevents noisy data from causing an object to be inferred to be smaller than a point source .",
    "each object s flux measured within the optimal aperture for a given filter is then corrected by dividing by @xmath97 to infer the total flux in that filter .",
    "another solution for attempting to handle both extended and unresolved sources is sextractor s auto aperture , which uses a kron ellipse adapted to each object s light profile to find @xmath98 of the flux for extended sources and @xmath99 for point sources using the parameters we have adopted , according to @xcite . in the @xmath18 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 filters , we find that auto indeed measures 96% of the point source flux found in a 14@xmath49 diameter aperture , with the value decreasing to 93% in @xmath4 , 92% in @xmath64 , and 89% in @xmath46 in keeping with the broader psf discussed above .      because sextractor assumes poisson sky noise , it produces underestimated photometric uncertainties for objects dimmer than the background sky .",

    "the standard formula used by sextractor to predict photometric errors in flux as a function of aperture size is @xmath100 where the first term represents sky fluctuations assuming uncorrelated noise between pixels , @xmath101 is the object flux in counts within the aperture , and @xmath102 is the total effective gain used to turn counts in the normalized image into original photons detected by the ccd , with the fraction @xmath103 giving the poisson variance .",
    "sextractor measures @xmath74 using the median fluctuation in its internally computed background map , and this measurement agrees with ours to within a few percent .",
    "we modified this to make use of our fits for ( correlated ) background noise which yields @xmath104 where the first term now represents empirical sky fluctuations which include the subdominant contribution from electronic readout noise .",
    "both noise terms will be larger in regions of the image where reduced exposure time leads to a lower effective gain and hence higher background rms .",
    "sextractor accounts for this by using a variance map @xmath105 which is either input as a weight_image or generated internally from a map of background fluctuations in the image .",
    "the errors produced by sextractor as a function of position are then @xmath106 the ratio of the formulas in equations [ eq : uncertainty_se ] and [ eq : uncertainty ] allows us to make a simple correction to the flux uncertainties output by sextractor to yield @xmath107 for negative fluxes , @xmath101 is set to zero in all of these error terms , since the uncertainty is entirely dominated by the background fluctuations . for auto apertures ,",
    "the area is given by that of the kron ellipse used i.e. @xmath108 ( the so - called kron_radius is really a scaling of the a_image and b_image parameters based on the second moment of the object light distribution ) .",
    "the resulting rms has units of counts per second and is converted to flux using the zeropoints in table [ tab : final ] . the uncertainty determined for optimized aperture fluxes",
    "is then multiplied by the same correction factor used to estimate the total object flux i.e. the reciprocal of @xmath97 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : fractional_flux_ij ] .",
    "finally , the uncertainty in the corrected aperture flux is increased by a factor @xmath109 which serves to amplify the uncertainties for extended sources to account for the uncertainty in their correction factors .",

    "the photometric errors derived in this manner do not include the 3% calibration uncertainty which is common to all sources in a given filter .",

    "again , these weights are only valid when used on the post - scaled images , and they differ by a factor of @xmath178 from the weights appropriate for the original images .    due to the large number of individual exposures taken in e.g. @xmath18-band and multiple observing runs , it is sometimes necessary to perform stacking as an iterative procedure . to do this , the signal , noise , and seeing in the intermediate stacked images should be measured empirically as before . then _ mscstack _ or the equivalent can be used to stack these intermediate images just as if they were individual images , scaling by the new _ mscscale _ values and calculating a new weights file using the above equations .",
    "as long as the final seeing is estimated well , no loss of signal - to - noise should occur from the iteration .",
    "a corollary question is when to discard an image with poor @xmath184 rather than to include it in the stack .",
    "the formal answer appears to be never as @xmath200 for all @xmath92 .",
    "the magic of the optimal weighting formula can be seen : @xmath201 hence the optimal weights cause @xmath184 to add in quadrature so it will never formally decrease no matter how poor an input image is .",
    "note that having a magnitude of extinction or twice the seeing still leaves an image with significant @xmath184 ; a @xmath184 threshold of 40% would require discarding images with about 2 times worse seeing or 1 magnitude of extinction ( if the sky background is unaffected ) .",
    "the @xmath184 of the combination of the image with a given @xmath184 and an image with 40% of that @xmath184 is 8% higher than that of the better image alone so this is somewhat useful .",
    "a conservative approach would be to cut entirely any images with @xmath202% that of the median image as a way of reducing systematic effects not accounted for by these idealized formulae .",
    "@xcite showed using simulations that the best performance for point source detection was achieved by filtering the image with the psf itself .",
    "this result is derived in the sextractor manual using fourier transforms . in practice due to the constraints of computation time one",
    "chooses to cut off the psf at a finite radius , as is standard in the convolution kernels offered as part of the sextractor package .",
    "the general case for an optimized weighted sum of pixel values @xmath203 , where each pixel has signal @xmath204 and noise @xmath205 , can be derived in analogy to the result for adding images found above , yielding @xmath206 .",
    "the constant background noise for sky - dominated objects thus leads to a filter of the precise shape of the psf . for objects significantly brighter than the sky , @xmath207 giving constant weight i.e. a tophat which gradually morphs into the roughly gaussian shape of the psf as you move far enough away from the object center for the sky to dominate the noise .",
    "sextractor only allows for a fixed convolution kernel so we optimized the detection for sky - dominated objects by using the psf ( truncated to 7@xmath487 pixels ) as our filter . by the same argument",
    ", the optimum signal - to - noise measurement of the photometry of a point source will be obtained by a weighted sum of pixel fluxes weighted using the psf shape itself centered at the barycenter of the object .",
    "this is typically referred to as `` psf photometry '' but it is not a supported feature of sextractor photometry , just of object detection .",
    "note that this is no longer strictly optimal when the noise is correlated between pixels as we have found in our images , since the derivation of the optimal weights for each pixel assumed uncorrelated noise .",
    "we decided against using psf photometry for this reason , and also because many of our science objects are slightly resolved and this would overweight the fluxes in their core , increase the risk of color biases , and complicate the task of correcting the aperture fluxes of extended objects .",
