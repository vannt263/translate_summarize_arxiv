    "the study of the kinematics of spiral galaxies is an active area of astronomical research .",
    "the construction of fabry - perot interferometers have greatly increased the kinematical knowledge of these objects . in this contribution , we present preliminary results from a fabry - perot study of ngc 5457 ( m101 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out during the night of july 23 - 24 , 2001 , with the unam scanning fabry - perot interferometer ( sfpi ) puma attached to the f/7.9 ritchey - chretien focus of the 2.1 m telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir , b.c .",
    "the main characteristics of puma can be found in rosado et al .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the adhoc package ( boulesteix 1993 ) .",
    "the reduction procedure followed a `` standard '' scheme and the details will be published elsewhere ( puerari et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "one of the main results obtained from fabry - perot data is the radial velocity field . by using this field , and the geometrical parameters of the galaxy ( inclination and position angles , kinematical center ) as well as the recession velocity",
    ", the rotation curve can be calculated . for ngc 5457 ,",
    "we have derived the rotation curve presented in fig . 1 ( left panels ) .",
    "this curve is in agreement with that one of comte et al .",
    "( 1979 , see their fig .",
    "6 ) , but our results present less dispersion , due to the better resolution and signal / noise ratio of our observations . assuming a distance of 7.2 mpc ( sandage & tammann 1974 ) , we have calculated a total mass of 9.8@xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 inside a radius of 48 ( or 10 kpc ) , also in agreement with comte et al . ( 1979 ) .",
    "we have also obtained the velocity dispersion of the hii region population .",
    "we fitted a gaussian to each hii region velocity profile and corrected the final value by the instrumental , thermal and intrinsic broadenings .",
    "the distribution of velocity dispersion values presents a normal behavior ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .",
    "the mean value of this distribution is 30 km sec@xmath4",
    "( i.e. , supersonic dispersion ) ; this result must be checked with fabry - perot studies at other lines ( eg . , [ sii ] ) .",
