    "a major problem in nuclear physics is the understanding of the structure of nuclei starting from nucleon - nucleon potentials that reproduce the nucleon - nucleon scattering data and the properties of the deuteron .",
    "there are nowadays many high accuracy nucleon - nucleon potentials that reproduce these data , either phenomenological or based on meson exchange theories , such as the argonne v18 ( ref.[1 ] ) and the cd - bonn 2000 ( ref.[2 ] ) or , based on chiral perturbation theory , the n3lo ( ref.[3 ] ) nn potential .",
    "accurate predictions at the level of nn potentials are rather important in order to elucidate the role of the nnn interaction which are much more difficult to use in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "once the nn potential is selected , one is left with the many - body problem to evaluate nuclear properties .",
    "there are two main steps in order to achieve this goal .",
    "the first step is to renormalize the nn interaction in order to be able to use small model spaces , and the second one is the many - body problem itself .",
    "although for very few nuclei ( closed shells ) sometimes the bare interaction is used , at the price of very large model spaces ( ref .",
    "[ 4 ] ) , a popular prescription is the lee - suzuki method , ( ref . [ 5 ] ) whereby an effective interaction is constructed in a small model space , typically using an harmonic oscillator basis , or , as in the case of low momentum interactions , a momentum basis ( ref .",
    "[ 6 ] and references in there ) .",
    "a limitation of this approach is that many - body interactions are introduced , and usually one keeps only the two - body part of the renormalized interaction ( the 2-particle cluster approximation ) . as a consequence",
    "the independence of the results from the model space must be checked . to further complicate matters ,",
    "the nn effective interaction derived in this way is not unique , especially because of the hermitization prescription .",
    "although the freedom to hermitize the effective interaction is large , two prescriptions are mostly used , the one of ref . [",
    "5 ] ( known as the okubo hermitization ) and the one of ref.[7 ] , mostly used with low momentum interactions .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that , at least in principle , this freedom could be used to mimic three - body force effects , much in the same spirit it is done with the jisp interactions ( ref.[8 ] and references in there ) .",
    "this could be very useful especially for low momentum interactions .",
    "the second step is the solution of the schroedinger equation for the nuclei under study .",
    "several methods are available .",
    "for example the no core shell model ( ncsm ) ( ref . [ 9],[10 ] ) ,",
    "which diagonalizes the hamiltonian renormalized up to a given number of @xmath3 excitations . or the coupled cluster method ( ref.[11 ] and references in there ) whereby the wave function is written as an exponential of one - body+two - body+ ... operators acting on a reference slater determinant .",
    "the first of these methods , although it is the most used in ab - initio studies of light nuclei , is limited by the large sizes of the hilbert space .",
    "the second of these methods , namely the coupled cluster method , is usually applied at or around closed shells . a third type of methods are based on variational schemes , as the vampir method and its variants ( ref.[12 ] ) , the quantum monte carlo method ( ref.[13 ] ) and the hybrid multideterminant method ( hmd ) ( ref.[14 ] ) . in this work",
    "we shall use this last one which is based on the expansion of the nuclear wave function as a sum of a large number ( as many as the accuracy demands ) of symmetry unrestricted slater determinants ( sd ) with the appropriate angular momentum and parity quantum numbers restored with projectors , the slater determinants being determined solely by variational requirements .",
    "this method does not suffer from the limitation of the size of the hilbert space , it approaches more and more the exact ground state wave function as the number of slater determinants is increased , and furthermore it is equally applicable to both closed and open shell nuclei .",
    "so far it has been applied in a no core fashion using the argonne v8 nn potential ( ref.[14 ] ) and to a phenomenological local potential in order to study shell effects using the bare interaction ( ref.[15 ] ) .",
    "it has also been applied to nuclei in the @xmath4 region using phenomenological effective interactions ( ref.[16]),however these systems are relatively easy since the bulk of the energies are of single - particle character .    in this work",
    "we shall apply the hmd method to @xmath0 starting from the accurate cd - bonn 2000 interaction .",
    "this nucleus has been extensively studied within the ncsm approach , using both the cdbonn ( ref . [",
    "17 ] ) , the cdbonn 2000 ( ref.[18],[19 ] ) and the n3lo interactions ( ref .",
    "the motivation to perform a calculation for this nucleus using a different many - body method is the following .",
    "an ab - initio calculation requires the results to be independent on the size of the model space and also on the value of @xmath3 of the harmonic oscillator single - particle basis , at least within some range of values .",
    "so far the calculations reported in the literature using the lee - suzuki renormalization prescription show a residual dependence on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "such a dependence is not seen using soft potentials such as the low - momentum interaction or the jisp16 interaction ( cf .",
    "eventually such a dependence should disappear using larger values of the maximum allowed number of @xmath3 excitations ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the hmd method does not use @xmath3 excitations , but rather utilizes an hamiltonian in a specified number of major harmonic oscillators shells , which contain a much larger ( although not all possible ) @xmath5 excitations .",
    "we do obtain a weaker dependence on @xmath3 , but the dependence does not disappear at large value @xmath3 .",
    "however we obtain a much lower value for the ground - state energy , closer to the experimental value .",
    "the hmd method , in its ab - initio form , can be formulated in two different ways .",
    "one can construct the effective hamiltonian directly in the lab frame for a specified number of harmonic oscillator major shells ( up to @xmath6 total quantum number ) using the standard talmi - moshinsky brackets ( cf . for example ref.[21 ] ) relating these matrix elements to the renormalized matrix elements in the center of mass frame ( hmd - a version ) . in this case the renormalized matrix elements in the center of mass frame up to @xmath7 total harmonic oscillator quantum number in the center of mass frame are needed .",
    "differently one could first construct the matrix elements of the renormalized hamiltonian using @xmath8 harmonic oscillator shells and then transform the hamiltonian to the lab frame using the same number @xmath8 of harmonic oscillator shells ( hmd - b version ) .",
    "the difference between the hmd - a and the hmd - b version consists in the fact that the hmd - a version truncates the hamiltonian used in the hmd - b version .",
    "conversely a large fraction of the matrix elements of the renormalized hamiltonian used by hmd - b are set to @xmath9 , more precisely all matrix elements of the type @xmath10 for which the states @xmath11 or @xmath12 satisfy the relation @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being the harmonic oscillator quantum numbers ) .",
    "the hmd - b version for @xmath15 is exact in the sense that reproduces to very high accuracy the eigenvalues of the bare hamiltonian , while the hmd - a version converges to the exact values only in the limit of a large number of harmonic oscillator shells . as a consequence the hmd - a version needs to be validated . for @xmath15",
    "clearly hmd - b is superior , however we find that for @xmath16 , hmd - b overbinds and that the hmd - a version is superior even for a smaller number of major harmonic oscillator shells .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that both versions neglect 3-particle cluster contributions to the renormalized interaction and the implication is therefore that hmd - a has smaller 3-particle cluster effects . in other words ,",
    "the truncation performed in the hmd - a version effectively takes into account at least some of the missing 3-body interaction induced by an exact renormalization , while in the hmd - b version this can be done only by increasing the number of major shells .",
    "this is of course a useful result , although empirical . for @xmath0",
    "we prefer to use the hmd - a version , since also for this nucleus hmd - b strongly overbinds even compared to the experimental binding energy .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we discuss the validation of the two versions and of the computer programs and in section 3 we discuss the case of @xmath0 and also the center of mass diagnostic recently proposed in ref .",
    "we also discuss a calculation for the @xmath17 excited state .",
    "both versions of the hmd method start , as in ncsm approach ( refs.[9],[10 ] ) , from the hamiltonian @xmath18 @xmath19 being the average nucleon mass for the nucleus under consideration , @xmath20 the nucleon - nucleon potential , @xmath21 is the total momentum and @xmath22 is the intrinsic hamiltonian . as in ref . [",
    "9 ] , to this hamiltonian an harmonic potential acting on the center of mass is added , that is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 in eq.(2 ) is the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian of the center of mass @xmath27    the hamiltonian of eq.(2 ) , in which @xmath28 is considered as a parameter , is solved for the two - particle systems in an harmonic oscillator basis using a large number of major shells ( typically @xmath29 ) in all possible angular momentum isospin and z - projection of the isospin channels @xmath30 in the intrinsic frame of the two - particle system .",
    "the number of major shell is taken large enough so that the hamiltonian can be considered in the `` infinite '' space ( the p+q space ) .",
    "all integrals are evaluated using typically @xmath31 integration points . after having done this",
    ", the lee - suzuki ( with the okubo hermitization ) renormalization prescription is performed in which the model space is restricted to the first @xmath8 major harmonic oscillator shells ( the p space ) of the intrinsic frame ( cf . also ref . [ 23 ] for a very compact derivation ) .",
    "@xmath32 is taken to be even , as it will clear in the following ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "once the renormalized @xmath28-dependent hamiltonian for the two - particle system is obtained , the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction are extracted and the matrix elements of the intrinsic hamiltonian of the @xmath28 particle system ( the original nucleus ) are evaluated .",
    "the hmd method can now be branched into two .",
    "the two - body matrix elements for the nucleus under consideration can be transformed into the lab frame up to @xmath33 major shells ( hmd - a version ) , or can be transformed into the lab frame up to @xmath8 major shells ( hmd - b version ) .",
    "the situation is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in the hmd - b version",
    "all matrix elements having one state in the upper right triangle are set to 0 .",
    "one can optionally add to the lab frame hamiltonian a term @xmath34 as commonly done .",
    "the effect of this term due to finite space sizes has been recently analyzed in ref . [ 22 ] in order to study unphysical couplings between intrinsic modes and center of mass excitations ( cf .",
    "next section also ) . in both hmd - a and hmd - b versions the resulting hamiltonian is the input for a variational calculation as done in ref .",
    "the variational method in the most recent computer programs is the one discussed in refs . [",
    "14],[24 ] .",
    "the wave function is a linear combination of slater determinants ( without symmetry restrictions ) with good quantum numbers restored by projectors .",
    "needless to say hmd - a is computationally cheaper than hmd - b .",
    "a 5 major shells calculation with hmd - a translates into a 9 major shells calculation with hmd - b , for example .",
    "the details of the optimization techniques will discussed in the next section , since they are the same utilized for the validation .",
    "the validation of the whole set of the computer codes is performed first on deuterium . actually in this ( and only in this case )",
    "a numerical cancellation in the renormalization step prevents the exact reproduction of the `` bare '' eigenvalues . for all other nuclei ,",
    "the renormalization step reproduces the `` bare '' eigenvalues belonging to the model space to very high accuracy . for @xmath35 with @xmath36",
    "we obtained the renormalized binding energy of deuterium with an error of @xmath37 using 15 slater determinants ( projected to @xmath38 ) using the version hmd - b .",
    "the situation is different for the hmd - a version since not all matrix elements in the intrinsic frame are used .",
    "we therefore expect that the variational calculation will reproduce the renormalized binding energy only in the limit of large @xmath6 .",
    "we performed some tests for @xmath39 . for @xmath40 the difference between the binding energy obtained by the variational calculation and the exact value is @xmath41 , for @xmath42 , we obtained @xmath43 and for @xmath44 ( excluding all states with @xmath45 ) we obtained @xmath46 .",
    "this test validates both versions of the methods .",
    "we performed also some tests for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath47 the binding energy obtained with the faddeev equation method ( ref .",
    "[ 25 ] ) using the cd - bonn 2000 interaction , is @xmath49 . in this case",
    "both versions can reach the exact value only in the limit of large @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "for the hmd - a version and @xmath50 , we obtained a ground state energy ( in mev ) of @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively . for low @xmath6 , about @xmath54 slater determinants ( with the @xmath55 projector ) are needed to converge . for large @xmath6",
    "the number of slater determinants is larger . for @xmath56 , the ground - state energy in mev",
    "is @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "as before , the calculations for large model space are more involved and a large number of slater determinants is necessary .",
    "we estimate a possible further decrease in the energy of few tens of @xmath61 . for larger values of @xmath3",
    "the calculation becomes increasingly more difficult for large model space .",
    "for @xmath62 we obtained for the ground - state energy ( in mev ) @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 for @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the wave functions obtained with the hmd - a version can serve as a variational input for the hmd - b version with @xmath7 .",
    "for this version we performed only few calculations since the model spaces are very large and the omission of large @xmath66 values of the single - particle orbits is necessary . as an example for @xmath50 and @xmath67 omitting all single - particle states having @xmath66 values larger than @xmath68 and using only @xmath69 slater determinants we obtained a ground - state energy of @xmath70 .",
    "the inclusion of larger @xmath66-values and the increase of the number of slater determinants will necessarily lower the energy .",
    "this value should be compared with the value obtained with the hmd - a version which is much closer to the exact faddeev result .",
    "the only source of discrepancy between the faddeev result and the hmd - b result comes from the missing 3-particle cluster contributions .",
    "the conclusion that we can draw is that the missing 3-particle cluster contributions are strongly repulsive .",
    "the effect of such contributions is much smaller in the hmd - a version .",
    "one expects that in order to suppress such contributions in the hmd - b implementation one has to increase the number of major shells . for @xmath56 and @xmath36",
    "we obtained a ground - state energy of @xmath71 , in this case we excluded from the calculation all @xmath72 values .",
    "the inclusion of these states will necessarily decrease the energy .",
    "the conclusion we can draw form these calculations is that the hmd - b version , although in principle more rigorous , strongly overbinds since it misses 3-particle cluster contributions , which seem less relevant in the hmd - a version .",
    "we performed a calculation also for @xmath0 using the hmd - b version , but even without full convergence to a large number of slater determinants we obtained strong overbinding .",
    "as done in all past calculations with the hmd method , we therefore use only the hmd - a implementation , it is inaccurate only for the 2-particle system , but that is hardly relevant for many - body problems .    using the hmd - a approach we performed a calculation for the binding energy of @xmath48 .",
    "we considered a reasonable value of the harmonic oscillator frequency , @xmath62 , rather than a full set of frequencies , and took @xmath73 .",
    "the ground - state energies are ( in mev ) @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the calculations become increasingly time consuming for large values of @xmath6 . in the case of @xmath53",
    "we built @xmath76 slater determinants using the partial @xmath77 projector and later reprojecting the energies using the full angular momentum projector .",
    "for @xmath44 we took only @xmath78 slater determinants .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculation are about @xmath79 or less and @xmath80 for @xmath44 .",
    "the ncsm result from ref .",
    "[ 27 ] is @xmath81 , indicating that for @xmath62 a larger number of major shells are necessary for good accuracy .",
    "the nucleus @xmath0 with the cdbonn-2000 interaction has been studied in the past in the framework of the ncsm method ( ref . [ 18],[19 ] ) .",
    "the ground - state energy obtained with this method is @xmath82 ( the experimental value from ref .",
    "[ 26 ] is @xmath83 ) .",
    "the ab - initio approach imposes at least for some @xmath3 interval constancy of the energies as the model space sizes are increased , and as @xmath3 is varied .",
    "we performed several calculations for this nucleus .",
    "the most relevant ones are the ones concerning the intrinsic energy .",
    "most often a center of mass term of the type @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the center of mass harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , is added to the intrinsic hamiltonian .",
    "the effects of the addition of such a term has been recently scrutinized in ref.[22 ] and the unphysical coupling between intrinsic and center of mass hamiltonian caused by the finite size of the model space , has been assessed .",
    "it was found in ref.[22 ] that this unphysical coupling using model space defined by a specified number of major shells can decrease the binding energy in an appreciable way . here",
    "the calculations with the hmd - a method are performed using the intrinsic hamiltonian .",
    "the effect of the addition of the center of mass hamiltonian will be analyzed at the end of the section .",
    "the hmd - a calculations proceed in two phases . in the first phase a large number of slater determinants , typically @xmath86 is generated using only a partial angular momentum and parity projector to good @xmath38 . in the second phase this set is reprojected using the full angular momentum and parity projector @xmath87 . at least for this nucleus and for this interaction",
    ", we find this optimization technique computationally more efficient than performing from the beginning the variational calculations with the full angular momentum and parity projector .",
    "the first phase is a combination of two steps .",
    "we first increase the number of slater determinants ( sd ) @xmath88 and optimize the last added sd using the steepest descent method , much in the same way it has been done in ref . [ 14 ] . in the second step",
    "we vary anew all sd s one at a time using the quasi - newtonian rank-3 update of ref .",
    "this second step is repeated several times until the energy decrease is less than a specified amount .",
    "afterwards , the addition step is repeated .",
    "we test the accuracy of the final wave function by plotting the energy vs @xmath89 .",
    "as it will be shown , for large @xmath88 in many cases the energy is linear in @xmath89 .",
    "the total number of sd necessary to obtain a reasonable convergence varies depending on the model space ( typically @xmath88 increases as @xmath6 is increased and the variational problem becomes harder as @xmath3 is increased ) .",
    "it does not seem that @xmath88 depends in any obvious way from the sizes of the hilbert space which can become very large as @xmath6 is increased .",
    "actually one the main reasons for using methods such as the hmd , is that the calculations can be performed even for very large size of the hilbert space .",
    "however feasibility does not necessarily imply accuracy , as the value of @xmath88 necessary to reach a given accuracy could depend on the size of the hilbert space .",
    "we performed a test using a set of 400 sd , for the same interaction , obtained as a part of another calculation for @xmath90 with @xmath91 ( not discussed in this work ) , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . a reprojection was performed as explained above .",
    "for @xmath0 typical size of the hilbert space range from about @xmath94 for @xmath95 to about @xmath96 for @xmath40 , while for @xmath90 at @xmath91 the size of the hilbert space is about @xmath97 .",
    "the calculated value for the ground - state energy of @xmath90 is @xmath98 ( to be compared with the experimental value of @xmath99 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show the behaviour of @xmath100 for large @xmath88 .",
    "a linear extrapolation shows that a plausible final energy of @xmath101 . a similar behavior is also seen for @xmath0 . for comparison in fig .",
    "3 we show the behavior of @xmath100 for @xmath0 at @xmath92 and @xmath40 with @xmath102 . since there is increase of several orders of magnitude in the size of the hilbert space from @xmath0 to @xmath90 it is reasonable to conclude that if there a dependence of @xmath88 on the size of the hilbert space , such a dependence is very mild .",
    "the behavior of the energy as a function of @xmath89 can change for different @xmath6 in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "sometimes the energy behaves as a higher power of @xmath89 especially for small @xmath6 .",
    "we performed calculations for @xmath0 for @xmath103 .",
    "the results are presented in the table .",
    "the results for @xmath95 and @xmath91 are well converged . for @xmath95 good convergence",
    "is reached using @xmath76 sd s ( however for @xmath62 we had to use @xmath104 sd s .",
    "for @xmath91 we used @xmath105 sd s ( @xmath106 for @xmath62 ) and also for @xmath40 .",
    "the results for @xmath42 should be considered as partial ones ( we used a set of 300 or less slater determinants ) .",

    "[ 22 ] , the problem of the effect of the addition of @xmath111 was studied . the main point in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] was that the addition of this term can significantly change the evaluation of the intrinsic energies .",
    "to be more precise , in a finite space , the eigenstates @xmath112 of @xmath113 are not a product of intrinsic eigenstates and center of mass eigenstates .",
    "thus the intrinsic energies , defined as @xmath114 acquire a @xmath115 dependence .",
    "these considerations do not apply to the calculations for @xmath0 discussed in this work for the following reason .",
    "our wave - functions are obtained by minimizing the energy expectation value of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , since the wave - functions contain @xmath116 space variables , it must factorize into a product of the intrinsic eigenstate and a function ( not necessarily an eigenstate ) of the center of mass coordinates .",

    "one can verify , however , the amount of contamination caused by @xmath111 to the intrinsic energies by first minimizing the expectation values of @xmath113 in order to obtain the wave functions @xmath112 , by evaluating the expectation values of @xmath22 with @xmath112 and then by comparing the energies obtained in this way with the real intrinsic energies . actually , it is easy to do slightly better than this because of the structure of the hmd ansatz for the wave - functions which are a linear combination of slater determinants ( intrinsic states ) .",
    "the coefficients of this linear combination can easily be determined anew in such a way to minimize the intrinsic energy without a re - variation of the intrinsic states . as an example we consider @xmath95 and @xmath92 and @xmath117 .",
    "the ground - state energy of @xmath113 is @xmath118 ( obtained with 150 sd s ) , while the intrinsic energy obtained using this eigenstate of @xmath113 is @xmath119 ( the coefficients of each sd was redetermined ) .",
