    "the ability to predict or anticipate future events is crucial for the survival of animals .",
    "predicting dynamical inputs can compensate the latency during information transfer and provide predictive information for learning and behavior @xcite . in 2007 , schwartz @xcite et al reported that there will be spontaneous responses from the ganglion cells in the retina of salamander and mice after a periodic light stimulation is abruptly stopped ; with the latency of this spontaneous response being linearly related to the period of the stopped stimulation . in other words , the retina seems to anticipate when the next upcoming pulse should have occurred and produce a response if the upcoming pulse is missing .",
    "this timed response for the omitted pulse from the retina is known as omitted stimulus response ( osr ) .",
    "phenomena similar to the osr have also been reported for induced ocular motor behavior under periodic light stimuli in zebra fish larvae @xcite and growth of slime mold under periodic alternation of moisture or temperature @xcite .",
    "ideally , one would like to quantify and model the predictive properties of a retina . although the phenomenon of osr has been discovered for more than 10 years , it is still not clear how to relate osr to the predictive properties of the retina . in osr ,",
    "information of the stimulation is apparently coded into the timing of the pulses . however , when there are fluctuations in the inter - pulse intervals of the stimulation , it is difficult to identify or even produce osr . therefore , it is not feasible to make use of osr in inferring the predictive properties of a retina for the general cases of a non - periodic stimulation which should contain much more information than a purely periodic one .",
    "bialek and tishby have introduced the idea of predictive information ( pi ) based on the statistical properties of the input and output signal of a data processing system @xcite .",
    "recently , this idea has been applied successfully to describe the response of a retina to a stimulation in the form of a stochastic moving bar by computing the mutual information , @xmath0 , between the input and output as a function of time shift @xmath1 between the two signals @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the form of @xmath0 should be determined by the predictive dynamics of the retina .",
    "however , it is still not clear what kind of information one can extract from @xmath0 .    in this work ,",
    "we report our experimental results in quantifying the predictive properties of a retina by using the pi method mentioned above . with a retina plated on top of a multi - electrode array ( mea ) probed by stochastic light pulses ,",
    "@xmath0 is measured as a function of the properties of the light pulses ; namely its mean inter - pulse interval ( @xmath2 ) and correlation time ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "our main finding is that the location of the peak of @xmath0 can be shifted from @xmath4 to @xmath5 by an increase of @xmath3 ; suggesting that retina has the ability to predict ( with some uncertainties ) future events in the stimulation when the stimulation is regular enough .",
    "however , this ability of prediction can only be observed when @xmath2 is in the range of 100 ms < @xmath2 < 200 ms ; similar to that of the osr phenomenon mentioned above measured in bullfrog retinas .",
    "furthermore , this predictive property of a retina can be used to distinguish the signals generated from an ornsteinuhlenbeck ( ou ) and an hidden markovian ( hmm ) process ; with the signal from the hmm process being identified as more predictable by the retina .",
    "retinas used in the experiments are obtained under dim red light from bullfrogs which were dark adapted for 1 hour before dissection .",
    "our sample is consisted of a piece of retina fixed on the 60-channel multi - electrode array ( mea , 200 m inter - electrode distance with 10 m electrode diameter ) by a permeable membrane and perfused with oxygenated ringer s solution .",
    "each retina preparation can last for 6 - 8 hours .",
    "stimulations to the retina is in the form of a train of stochastic light pulses ( pulse duration = 50 ms ) generated from a led ( peak of wavelength = 560 nm , intensity = 5 cd / m@xmath6 ) which illuminates the whole retina through a projection lens .",
    "the interval between pulses is controlled by a computer to produce a train of pulses with different characteristics which will be described in details below .",
    "responses from the retinas are recorded at 20 khz through the local field potentials at the 60 electrodes of the mea .",
    "spike sorting is performed through the offline sorter software .",
    "signals with ambiguous or multiple waveforms are discarded .",
    "firing rates are calculated as the number of spikes identified within a 5 ms bin .",
    "our experiments consist of recording responses of the retina for stimulations with different characteristics .",
    "the protocol is to present each set of stimuli continuously for 5 min in a random order , and the inter - experiment resting time is 23 min . for osr measurements , the same stimuli constituted of 20 pulses",
    "are repeated for 1020 trials with 35 sec inter - trial resting time .",
    "all the experiments are carried out in a dark room with temperature around 25 c. in the results reported below , over ten retina samples are used and at least three retina samples ( on average 1020 waveforms sorted from each sample ) were used to verify each experimental results .",
    "figure  [ fig1:stochastic pulses]a shows inter - pulse - interval ( @xmath7 ) of the stochastic pulse train used in the experiment as a function of time ( with a discrete time step of 5 ms ) .",
    "the pulse train is characterized by three parameters ; namely the mean inter - pulse interval ( @xmath8 ) , the correlation time between inter - pulse intervals ( @xmath3 ) and the standard deviations of @xmath7 .",
    "this stimulation series is generated by following the idea of palmer et al @xcite which is associated with a damped harmonic oscillator driven by noise , with the @xmath9 intervals being generated as : @xmath10 where _ v _ is the rate of change of @xmath7 , @xmath11 a gaussian noise with zero mean with amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the iteration step size @xmath13 is fixed at 1/60 in the iteration .",
    "note that @xmath14/2@xmath15 is kept at 1.06 so that the system is slightly over - damped . to generate the stimulations ,",
    "the series @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is first created by the iteration of eq .",
    "and eq .  . then , the standard deviations of @xmath16 is rescaled to have a fixed value of 20 ms and an offset is added to @xmath16 to obtain the desired mean @xmath8 . with this method ,",
    "the correlation of @xmath16 is not only controlled by @xmath14 , the rescaling of its standard deviation and the addition of offset all affect the correlation time of the series .",
    "the correlation time of the resultant stimulation must then be measured by computing its autocorrelation function . note that when @xmath3 tends to @xmath18 , we will recover the periodic stimulation in osr . with this stochastic pulse train",

    "the maximal states within 50 ms is on average 1015 spikes . the mutual information at time shift @xmath1 is then given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability of having a state @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the joint probability of the state @xmath27 .",

    "this definition satisfies the intuitive notion that @xmath43 or @xmath44 equals to 1 and will allow the comparison of predictive information between different experiments . a remarkable feature of fig .  [ fig3:comparison ]",
    "is that while both @xmath38 and @xmath39 decay symmetrically about @xmath45 , @xmath29 seems to decay slower for @xmath30 .",
    "since both @xmath32 and @xmath31 are symmetric with respect to time lag , the asymmetry of @xmath29 possibly comes from the anticipative nature of the retina dynamics in generating @xmath32 .     as described in the text and the definition of predictive power ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "note that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are symmetric about their respective peaks but @xmath49 is not symmetric ( inset ) .",

    "although the periodic input used in osr and the stochastic pulses used in this study seem to be quite different , the periodic pulses are in fact a limiting case of the stochastic pulses when the correlation time of the inter - pulse interval becomes infinite . with this consideration",
    ", one can think of the periodic pulses used in the phenomenon of osr as the carrier of information very much like the carrier wave in an fm radio signal and the information is being encoded into the deviations ( fluctuations ) from the carrier period .",
    "therefore , the stochastic pulses ( with a fixed mean period ) used in our experiments are then encoding information in its deviations from the mean .",
    "the amount of information encoded can then be characterized by the correlation time ; the longer the @xmath3 , the less the amount of encoded information . with a periodic stimulation ( infinite correlation time ) , there is no information encoded .",
    "in fact , this carrier wave picture is supported by our finding that both osr and @xmath8 for optimal prediction have the same time scale .",
    "we have therefore extended the study of anticipative capability of a retina from probing it with period stimulations to stochastic stimulations .",
    "although the responses of the retina induced by these two types of stimulations seem to be very different , they are of the same nature . in the osr",
    ", a clear transient , spontaneous ( anticipative ) response can be observed in the phenomenon of osr after the termination of the periodic stimulations while there seems to be no clear anticipative responses can be identified after the termination of the stochastic stimulations .",
    "however , the results shown in fig .  [ fig6:latency ] show that the retina is generating signals ahead of the stimulation with similar information .",
    "that is : the retina is actively producing spontaneous output corresponding to future events of the stimulation ; similar to the case of osr .",
    "the picture emerges from the above discussions is that the retina is spontaneously / actively producing output to predict the future .",
    "the location of @xmath66 can then be used as an indicator of the complexity or predictability of the stimulation .",
    "intuitively , @xmath66 will be more negative when the signals is more complex or more difficult to predict .",
    "to test this idea , we have also performed experiments with stimulations generated by an ou process .",
    "we have tuned the ou process in such that its time scales and fluctuations are similar to those used in our experiments reported above .",
    "figure  [ fig7:discriminating ] is a comparison for @xmath35 obtained from the ou process and that from fig .",
    "[ fig3:comparison ] .",
    "it can be seen that the peak of @xmath35 from the ou process lags behind from that of our experiment ; demonstrating that retina can distinguish these two types of signals and indicate that the time series from the ou process is more complex that that used in our experiment .",
    "note that the ou process is a markovian process while the time interval signal used in our experiment is not .",
    "there is a hidden variable @xmath71 , which can be deduced from successive values of pulse interval , forming a hidden markov model .",
    "our experimental results show that the retina somehow manages to make use of this hidden information to anticipate the next time interval and therefore produce a peak in @xmath35 which can be located at @xmath72 .",
