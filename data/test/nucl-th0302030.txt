    "the glauber model ( gm ) @xcite has been employed for describing heavy ion reactions at high energies .",
    "it is a semiclassical model picturing the nuclei moving in a straight path along the collision direction , and gives the nucleus - nucleus interaction @xcite in terms of interaction between the constituent nucleons ( nn cross section ) and nuclear density distributions .",
    "it is a well established model for high energies and has been applied to heavy ion collision for describing a number of reaction processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important physical quantities characterizing the nuclear reactions is the total reaction cross section .",
    "it is very useful for extracting information about the nuclear sizes .",
    "the glauber model has been successively used to get the radii of radioactive nuclei from measured total reaction cross sections @xcite .    at low energies ,",
    "the straight line trajectory is modified due to the coulomb field between two nuclei .",
    "the coulomb modified glauber model ( cmgm ) @xcite consists of replacing the eikonal trajectory at an impact parameter @xmath0 , with the eikonal trajectory at the corresponding distance @xmath1 of closest approach in the presence of the coulomb field .",
    "later the non eikonal nature of the trajectory around @xmath1 , has also been taken into account @xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath1 by the distance @xmath2 of closest approach in the presence of both the coulomb and the nuclear field gives the coulomb plus nuclear modified glauber model ( cnmgm ) @xcite .",
    "this model ( cmgm / cnmgm ) has been widely used in recent literature @xcite .",
    "warner et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "have shown in their calculations for light projectiles on various targets that trajectory modifications are minor .",
    "let us remark that the energies considered by them is much above the coulomb barrier .",
    "the coulomb modified glauber model has also been used at very high energies @xcite where trajectory modifications may be ineffective .",
    "there have been various prescriptions @xcite to modify the nn cross sections due to nuclear density .",
    "most of the work reported earlier @xcite has been done using gaussian densities .",
    "the reaction cross section is sensitive to surface density of the colliding nuclei .",
    "depending on how well one has produced the surface texture with the gaussian form , it will make a 5 to 10 % change in the reaction cross section over that done with realistic densities @xcite .    in the light of this , we reexamine the various trajectory corrections in the glauber model and calculate the total reaction cross section as a function of energy upto 50 times the coulomb barrier .",
    "we quantify the energy range in which a particular correction is effective and find that when the center of mass energy of the system becomes 30 times the coulomb barrier , the above modifications to gm are insignificant .",
    "thus , the energy at and above which the results of cnmgm and gm coincide depends on the coulomb barrier between the two nuclei and will be different for a light and heavy system .",
    "in the present work we use exact nuclear densities and free nn cross sections . the center of mass correction which is important for light systems has also been taken into account .",
    "comparison of the experimental data with our calculations are presented in the plots of @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "consider the collision of a projectile nucleus @xmath5 on a target nucleus @xmath6 . the probability for occurrence of a nucleon - nucleon collision when the nuclei @xmath5 and @xmath6 collide at an impact parameter @xmath7 relative to each other is given by @xcite @xmath8    here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the z - integrated densities of projectile and target nuclei respectively .",

    "the probability of occurrence of @xmath16 collisions will be @xmath17 here , @xmath18 .",

    "the profile function @xmath32 for the nn scattering can be taken as delta function if the nucleons are point particles .",
    "in general it is taken as a gaussian function of width @xmath34 as @xmath35 thus , @xmath36 here , @xmath34 is the range parameter and has a weak dependence on energy ( see for discussions@xcite ) .",
