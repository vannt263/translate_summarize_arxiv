    "+ in these schemes poles cancel analytically .",
    "we illustrate this by taking the real and virtual contribution of a nlo cross section in .",
    "the real - radiation cross section is made integrable in four dimensions by a suitable subtraction term that mimics the behaviour of the squared matrix element in the singular limits .",
    "adding the subtracted term back and integrating it analytically over the unresolved one - particle phase space provides poles that cancel the poles of the virtual contribution .",

    "analytically integrated subtraction terms cancel the explicit poles of virtual contributions .",
    "+ here we present stripper ( sector improved phase space for real radiation ) , a nnlo subtraction scheme that is completely numerical and avoids cumbersome analytic integrations .",
    "the scheme was introduced in @xcite and generalized to arbitrary final states in @xcite .",
    "it has been first applied to top - quark pair production @xcite , and subsequently to other processes of low multiplicity : higgs @xmath26 jet @xcite , charmless bottom quark decay @xcite , top quark decay @xcite , single top quark production @xcite , muon decay @xcite and z decay @xcite .",
    "+ the scheme was initially formulated using conventional dimensional regularization ( cdr ) , where momenta and spin degrees of freedom of resolved and unresolved particles are treated in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "unresolved particles are either virtual particles of loop contributions or real - radiated particles that can become soft or collinear . in contrast to analytic subtraction schemes , momenta of resolved particles",
    "are explicitly parameterized in @xmath27 dimensions .",
    "the explicit dimension increases as the multiplicity of the final state rises , e.g. for top - quark pair production already five dimensions have been parameterized explicitly .",
    "it turns out that stripper in cdr is not applicable for high multiplicities .",
    "in addition , tree - level matrix elements , that appear in subtraction terms , have to be provided to several powers in @xmath12 .",
    "available software only provides them up to @xmath28 .",
    "+ thus , it has been necessary to reformulate the scheme in t hooft - veltman regularization ( hv ) , where momenta and spin degrees of freedom of resolved particles are four - dimensional .",
    "+ in this proceeding , we explain the general idea of stripper in order to obtain a laurent series in @xmath12 for @xmath17 , where each coefficient can be calculated numerically . afterwards ,",
    "we shortly point out how it can be reformulated in hv to provide a self - contained subtraction scheme for nnlo calculations .",
    "the detailed description is to be found in @xcite .",
    "the subtraction scheme stripper is an algorithmic method to extract real singularities of different contributions in .",
    "each part will be given as a laurent series in @xmath12 , where each coefficient has been calculated numerically .",
    "the final result , after summing the different parts , is finite .",
    "+ we outline the method for @xmath17 as given in .",
    "since it contains two additional , potentially unresolved , partons , the phase space integral has the most complicated infrared structure .",
    "+ first , we split the phase space into double - collinear and triple - collinear sectors . in a triple - collinear sector",
    "singularities are generated as three specific partons become collinear to each other and/or two of them soft . in a double - collinear sector singularities",
    "emerge as two specific pairs of partons become collinear and/or two of them soft .",
    "+ in a next step , we parameterize the collinear particles in each sector separately using energies and angles .",
    "we illustrate the parametrization on the basis of a triple - collinear sector , where the three particles are in the final state : the reference momentum indicating the triple - collinear direction is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "the momenta of the unresolved partons are named @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "each momentum is parameterized by its energy and a @xmath32-dimensional unit vector in spherical coordinates r^r^0    1 +    , u_1^u_1 ^ 0    1 +    , u_2^u_2 ^ 0    1 +    .",
    "the unresolved particles energies are rescaled by their maximal value @xmath33 , @xmath34 , for @xmath35 .",
    "the soft limit is approached as @xmath36 and/or @xmath37 . using rotations in @xmath32-dimensions , the scalar products between the three given momenta take the following form = _ 1 = 1 - 2_1 , = _ 2 = 1 - 2_2 , = _ 1 _ 2 + _ 2 _ 1_2 .",
    "parametrization of a triple - collinear sector , where the three partons are in the final state .",
    "the reference momentum is @xmath38 , the unresolved momenta are denoted by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the sum of momenta of remaining resolved particles is @xmath41 . ]",
    "this parametrization is shown in figure [ fig : parametrization ] .",
    "the limit of @xmath42 at zero indicates the collinear limit of one of the unresolved partons and the reference parton .",
    "@xmath43 is collinear to @xmath44 when @xmath45 and @xmath46 . a non - linear transformation of @xmath47 to @xmath48 , _ 2 _ 2(_1,_2 , )",
    ", then ensures that @xmath47 always vanishes as @xmath49 .",
    "accordingly , all possible collinear limits are indicated only by two variables : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , if we find a formulation in hv , meaning that all other momenta and the reference momentum are four - dimensional , at most six dimensions are needed to parameterize all possible scalar products consistently .",
    "+ at this point , four physical variables @xmath52 parameterize all possible soft and collinear limits in a given sector .",
    "additional sector decompositions @xcite in those variables factorize all possible overlapping singularities that appear at nnlo . in practice",
    "this amounts to split each sector again .",
    "for example double - soft overlapping singularities are disentangled using [ eq : decomp ] 1=(_1-_2)+ ( _ 2-_1 ) .",
    "the decomposition of the phase space due to soft overlapping singularities is sufficient to factorize all possible limits in a double - collinear sector . in a triple - collinear sector",
    "the phase space is split into five additional sectors to factorize collinear and soft - collinear overlapping singularities .",
    "this splitting is accompanied by a transition from physical variables @xmath53 to corresponding sector variables @xmath54 .",
    "+ finally , the full double - real radiation cross section can be written as a sum over different decomposed triple- and double - collinear sectors ^_ab=_s ^,s_ab .",
    "each contribution has the following form ^,s_ab=_0 ^ 1 _ 1_2_1_2 .",
    "the function @xmath55 is finite in the limit of vanishing arguments .",
    "all appearing singularities are factorized in the sector variables .",
    "poles are extracted by an iterative usage of the plus distribution in each variable [ eq : plus ] _ 0 ^ 1x=+_0 ^ 1x .",
    "we obtain a laurent series in @xmath12 and all coefficients are calculated numerically .",
    "the described procedure is process independent , since it is possible to use the known universal infrared - limits of qcd amplitudes for the subtraction terms in .",
    "the above procedure is carried out in cdr , i.e. resolved and unresolved momenta are @xmath56-dimensional . to get a transition to the t hooft - veltman regularization scheme",
    ", we have to identify unresolved particles in different contributions of : either one particle is unresolved , what we call the single - unresolved contribution , or two particles are unresolved , what we call the double - unresolved contribution . by adding process independent correction terms to the single - unresolved contribution and subtracting them from the double - unresolved contribution",
    "we make sure that the two contributions are finite separately .",
    "now we are able to identify unresolved and resolved particles unambiguously .",
    "since each contribution is finite we set the momenta of resolved particles to @xmath57 dimensions , the mistake is of order @xmath12 .",
    "this makes sure that explicit parameterized dimensions are limited to six for arbitrary multiplicities .",
    "setting also their spin degrees of freedom to the physical dimensions allows us to use matrix elements at order @xmath28 .",
    "+ to avoid contractions between @xmath56-dimensional vectors of unresolved momenta and four - dimensional matrix elements , we replace spin - correlated splitting functions in collinear subtraction terms by their azimuthal averaged counterparts .",
    "+ this procedure leads to a fully general subtraction algorithm for nnlo calculations .",
    "in this proceeding , we presented the general formulation of stripper , a subtraction scheme to calculate cross sections at nnlo in perturbative qcd for arbitrary multiplicities .",
    "the full subtraction scheme , completely described in @xcite , can readily implemented in a computer code .",
