    "the picture of strongly correlated localized or nearly - localized electrons is the base of a successful theoretical description of both high - temperature superconductivity and magnetism ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and citations given there ) . in almost all cases the appertaining localized electron states",
    "are represented by atomic orbitals that define , for instance , partially filled @xmath0- , @xmath1- , or @xmath2- bands .",
    "another option would be to represent the localized electron states by best localized and symmetry - adapted wannier functions .",
    "in contrast to atomic functions , wannier functions situated at _",
    "adjacent _ atoms are _ orthogonal _ and , hence , electrons occupying ( temporarily ) adjacent localized states represented by wannier functions comply with the pauli principle .",
    "in addition , wannier function form a _ complete _ set of basis functions within the considered narrow , partially filled band .",
    "consequently , wannier functions contain _ all _ the physical information about this energy band .",
    "wannier functions tend to be ignored by the theory of superconductivity and magnetism because we need a _ closed _ complex of energy bands [ definition  [ def:2 ] ] for the construction of _ best localized _ wannier functions .",
    "such closed complexes , however , do not exist in the band structures of the metals where all the bands are connected to each other by band degeneracies .    fortunately , this problem can be solved in a natural way by constructing wannier functions with the reduced symmetry of a magnetic group or by constructing spin - dependent wannier functions as shall be details in the present paper . in both cases ,",
    "interfering band degeneracies are sometimes removed in the band structure with the reduced symmetry .    against the background of the described characteristics of the wannier functions",
    ", our following two observations should not be too surprising :    1 .",
    "materials possessing a magnetic structure with the magnetic group @xmath3 also possess a closed , narrow and roughly half - filled complex of energy bands in their band structure whose bloch functions can be unitarily transformed into best localized wannier functions that are symmetry - adapted to the magnetic group @xmath3 .",
    "these energy bands form a `` magnetic band '' , see definition  [ def:21 ] .",
    "2 .   both normal and high - temperature superconductors ( and only superconductors ) possess a closed , narrow and roughly half - filled complex of energy bands in their band structure whose bloch spinors can be unitarily transformed into best localized _ spin - dependent _ wannier functions that are symmetry - adapted to the ( full ) space group @xmath4 of the material .",
    "these energy bands form a `` superconducting band '' , see definition  [ def:22 ] .    the first observation ( i )",
    "was made at the band structures of cr  @xcite , fe  @xcite , la@xmath5cuo@xmath6  @xcite , yba@xmath5cu@xmath7o@xmath8  @xcite , undoped lafeaso  @xcite , and bafe@xmath5as@xmath5  @xcite ; the second observation ( ii ) at the band structures of numerous elemental superconductors  @xcite and of the ( high - temperature ) superconductors la@xmath5cuo@xmath6  @xcite , yba@xmath5cu@xmath7o@xmath9  @xcite , mgb@xmath5  @xcite , and doped lafeaso  @xcite .",
    "it is particularly important that partly filled superconducting bands can not be found in those elemental metals ( such as li , na , k , rb , cs , ca cu , ag , and au ) which do not become superconducting  @xcite .",
    "an investigation into the band structures of the transition metals in terms of superconducting bands straightforwardly leads to the matthias rule  @xcite .",
    "though these two observations are clear , their theoretical interpretation is initially difficult .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the models of localized electrons developed so far , as , e.g. , the familiar hubbard model  @xcite , are tailored to _",
    "atomic orbitals _ that represent the localized states during an electronic hopping motion . within modern theoretical concepts ,",
    "the wannier functions often are nothing but a complete basis in the space spanned by the bloch functions .",
    "thus , their symmetry is often believed to do not tell anything about the physics of strongly correlated electrons .    in the light of this background , we suggest to interpret the special symmetries of best localized wannier functions within the nonadiabatic heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "this model of strongly correlated localized electrons starts in a consistent way from symmetry - adapted and best localized _ wannier _ functions that represent the localized electron states related to the hopping motion and defines the hamiltonian @xmath10 of the related nonadiabatic system . on the basis of the symmetry of the wannier functions ,",
    "the nonadiabatic model makes clear predictions whether or not @xmath10 can possess superconducting or magnetic _ eigenstates _  @xcite . in this context , the nonadiabatic heisenberg model no longer uses terms like @xmath0- , @xmath2- , or @xmath1-bands , but only speaks of superconducting or magnetic bands .    in particularly interesting cases , the nonadiabatic heisenberg model predicts that a small distortion of the lattice or a doping is required for the stability of the superconducting or magnetic state .",
    "thus , in undoped lafeaso  @xcite and in bafe@xmath5as@xmath5  @xcite the antiferromagnetic state must be stabilized by an experimentally well established distortion  @xcite , while in yba@xmath5cu@xmath7o@xmath8  @xcite it is stable in the undistorted crystal .",
    "superconductivity in lafeaso  @xcite requires the experimentally confirmed doping  @xcite . also the superconducting state in lifeas",
    "@xcite should be accompanied by a small distortion of the lattice which , to our knowledge , is experimentally not yet confirmed .",
    "superconductivity in yba@xmath5cu@xmath7o@xmath9  @xcite , mgb@xmath5  @xcite as well as in the transition elements  @xcite ( such as in nb  @xcite ) , on the other hand , does not require any distortion or doping .    in the case of ( conventional and high-@xmath11  @xcite ) superconductivity",
    ", the nonadiabatic heisenberg model provides a new mechanism of cooper pair formation which may be described in terms of _ constraining forces _",
    "@xcite and _ spring - mounted cooper pairs _  @xcite .",
    "any application of the nonadiabatic heisenberg model starts with a determination of the symmetry of best localized ( spin - dependent ) wannier functions related to the band structure of the material under consideration .",
    "in the following we shall summarize and update the group theory of wannier functions as published in former papers and give a detailed description how to determine the symmetry of best localized wannier functions if they exist in the given band structure . though we shall also define the two terms `` magnetic '' and `` superconducting '' bands which are related to the nonadiabatic heisenberg model ,",
    "the presented group theory _ is independent of any physical model of magnetism or superconductivity_.",
    "consider a closed complex of @xmath12 energy bands in the band structure of a metal or a semiconductor .",
    "[ def:2 ] a complex of energy bands is called closed if the bands are not connected by degeneracies to bands not belonging to the complex .",
    "[ def:14 ] in the following a closed complex of @xmath12 energy bands is referred to as a single closed band consisting of @xmath12 branches .",
    "the metals do not possess closed bands in their band structures .",
    "however , closed bands may arise after the activation of a perturbation reducing the symmetry in such a way that interfering band degeneracies are removed . such a reduction of the symmetry may be caused by a magnetic structure or by a ( slight ) distortion of the crystal .",
    "hence , we assume that the hamiltonian @xmath13 of a single electron in the considered material consists of a part @xmath14 with the unperturbed space group @xmath4 and a perturbation @xmath15 with the space group @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath16 is a subgroup of @xmath4 , @xmath18 in general , the considered closed energy band of @xmath12 branches was not closed before the perturbation @xmath15 was activated .    assume the bloch functions @xmath19 ( labeled by the wave vector @xmath20 and the branch index @xmath21 ) as the solutions of the schrdinger equation of @xmath13 to be completely calculated in the first domain of the brillouin zone .
