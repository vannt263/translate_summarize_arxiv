    "one of the longstanding questions of elementary particle physics is whether nature makes use of the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking to endow the particles with their masses .",
    "the higgs boson , @xmath5 , is the missing link sought to verify this theoretical concept in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its mass , @xmath6 , is essentially a free parameter of the sm .",
    "the failure of experiments at the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep  1 ) and the slac linear collider ( slc ) to observe the decay @xmath7 has ruled out the mass range @xmath8  gev at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",

    "we note in passing that @xmath6 lower bounds may also be derived theoretically by demanding that the higgs vacuum be ( meta)stable @xcite .",
    "several theoretical arguments bound @xmath6 from above .",
    "the requirement that partial - wave unitarity in intermediate - boson scattering at high energies be satisfied at tree level establishes an upper bound on @xmath6 at about @xmath13  tev @xcite .",
    "this unitarity bound is significantly lowered by including one- @xcite and two - loop @xcite corrections . however , the improved bound depends on the energy scale , @xmath14 , up to which the sm is assumed to remain valid .",
    "the same is true for the triviality bound , which is derived perturbatively @xcite by requiring that the running higgs self - coupling , @xmath15 , stays finite for renormalization scales @xmath16 .",
    "lattice computations , which take all orders of the perturbative expansion into account , yield a triviality bound of @xmath17  gev @xcite .",
    "the precise value of this bound depends on the specific form of the lattice action and the regularization method used .",
    "an alternative way of constraining @xmath6 from above is to require that the higgs sector be weakly interacting , so that perturbation theory is meaningful @xcite .",
    "the resulting bounds depend somewhat on the considered process and the precise definition of perturbation - theory breakdown , but they are independent of assumptions concerning the scale @xmath14 beyond which new physics operates . at one and two loops , the leading high-@xmath6 corrections to physical observables related to higgs - boson production or decay",
    "are of @xmath18 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the partial widths of the higgs - boson decays to pairs of fermions @xcite and intermediate bosons @xcite are relatively modest , below 15% at @xmath19  tev if the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme is employed .",
    "the situation is similar for higgs - boson production @xcite . for @xmath6 increasing , the @xmath3 corrections will eventually exceed the @xmath18 ones in size . in the case of the fermionic higgs - boson decays",
    ", this happens at @xmath20  tev in the on - shell scheme @xcite .",
    "obviously , the perturbative expansion in @xmath21 ceases to usefully converge for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "the study of high - energy weak - boson scattering at two loops ( with neglect of trilinear couplings ) leads to a perturbative upper bound on @xmath6 which depends on the considered c.m .  energy . for @xmath22 in the 1-tev range , the @xmath6 upper",
    "bound comes out as low as 450  gev  @xcite .",
    "however , this result may be relaxed using resummation techniques @xcite .",
    "since a higgs boson with @xmath23 decays almost exclusively to @xmath24 and @xmath25 pairs , it is desirable , both from the theoretical and phenomenological points of view , to find the two - loop @xmath3 corrections to the partial widths of these decays as well .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "in contrast to the fermionic case @xcite , this involves the calculation of massive three - point functions at two loops .",
    "due to the presence of a large external momentum , heavy - mass expansion techniques are not applicable here . as in a previous analysis @xcite , we take advantage of the goldstone - boson equivalence theorem @xcite and neglect the gauge and yukawa couplings as well as the intermediate - boson masses . in this approximation ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 decay widths coincide .    in the evaluation of the relevant two - loop feynman diagrams , both infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences occur .",
    "we calculate all divergent diagrams analytically , using dimensional regularization .",
    "this guarantees that the cancellation of the ir and uv divergences is manifest .",
    "the remaining diagrams are individually devoid of singularities .",
    "they are computed numerically in four space - time dimensions after formulating the integrals in parallel and orthogonal space .",
    "this has the advantage that potential numerical instabilities in connection with the conventional feynman parameterizations are avoided .",
    "we list our results for the individual diagrams , so that they are available to other authors for comparisons and further calculations .",
    "we anticipate that we find good agreement with a recent , pioneering work by ghinculov @xcite , which fully resorts to numerical methods . in ref .",

    "the final result is obtained by numerically taking the massless limit .",
    "another conceptual difficulty in ref .",
