    "whereas there are a number of examples of exact analytic solutions of time - independent problems in quantum mechanics , such solutions of time - dependent problems are few .",
    "the analytic solutions of both types that do exist tend to provide approximate models to actual physical systems . no doubt such solutions are instructive for gaining insight into the behavior of the physical systems that they describe . nevertheless because the models themselves are often approximations and because one wishes to describe real systems as precisely as possible , one also relies on accurate numerical methods .    the time - dependence of nonrelativistic quantum systems , which is the focus of this paper , has become important in diverse areas of atomic and subatomic physics .",
    "examples of these include the study of nuclear processes such as the decay of unstable nuclei and associated phenomena like atomic ionization  @xcite and bremsstrahlung  @xcite , the study of fundamental processes necessary for quantum computing  @xcite , the study of mesoscopic physics or nanophysics devices  @xcite , and the motion of atoms in a trap . a reliable and accurate numerical determination of the time - dependent wave function such as we discuss in this paper will no doubt be necessary and/or helpful in making advances in the understanding of a variety of quantum processes .    in this paper we consider the numerical solution of the time - dependent nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "much has been learned about basic scattering processes from the numerically generated solutions of traveling wavepackets as they pass through a potential region  @xcite , as well as the time - evolution of unstable quantum processes  @xcite .",
    "however , the methods used in the past , and still employed currently , are limited in that the solutions often degrade after a certain time interval , so that they reduce to noise .",
    "furthermore for processes in which the wave function spreads or travels away from the source one often requires such a large number of space steps that the computation becomes prohibitive .",
    "the goal of this study is to improve the existing standard approach by allowing for relatively large step sizes both in time and in space and thus to reduce the number of basic arithmetical calculations while obtaining more accurate solutions .",
    "we have been able to make significant improvement to one conventional approach , _ viz .",
    "_ , the crank - nicolson ( cn ) implicit integration scheme for the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "many years ago the cn approach was shown to be successful in the study of wavepacket scattering in one dimension by goldberg _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in recent years",
    "the cn method continues to be employed for its space- and/or time - development algorithm to study various time - dependent problems .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "the attractive aspect of this method is that the solution is constrained to be unitary at every time step .",
    "it is this constraint that makes the solution stable regardless of time- or space - step size .",
    "although the evolution of the solution is unitary , the wave function is not correct if the step sizes are too large .",
    "the error is of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spatial and temporal step size , respectively .",
    "the method was successfully generalized to two dimensional scattering by galbraith _",

    "@xcite and , more recently , to multichannel scattering  @xcite .",
    "furthermore alternative methods which are fast computationally were introduced by kosloff and kosloff  @xcite .",
    "these involve the fast fourier transform of the kinetic energy operator of the schrdinger equation . variants of this method were discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although this approach is fast and is able to handle large time intervals in one pass , it is not unitary and does require a large number of space intervals .    improved cn algorithms have been discussed by a few authors .",

    "@xcite introduced a seven - point formula for the second - order spatial derivative with error of @xmath8 and an improved time - integration scheme with an error of @xmath9 .",
    "they claim to obtain two orders of magnitude improvement in the time advance .",
    "moyer  @xcite uses a numerov scheme for the spatial integration method with error of @xmath10 but has a one - stage time evolution giving the cn precision in time , i.e. , with an error of @xmath11 .",
    "moyer also introduces transparent boundary conditions for unconfined systems .",
    "we have found these very useful for making long - time or large - space problems tractable  @xcite , but we will not discuss such boundary conditions further in this paper .",

    "we focus on the second - order spatial derivative in @xmath22 of eq .",

    "we generalize the usual three - point formula and the seven - point formula of miicu _ et al . _",

    "such a formula has the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 are real constants . to obtain the coefficients @xmath25",

    "when we add the two equations , the terms with odd - order derivatives cancel , resulting in the equation @xmath31 thus we obtain the system of @xmath2 equations in @xmath2 unknowns , i.e. , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34    we solve these equations to obtain @xmath35 . it is evident from the terms on the right side of eqs .",

    "for example , the first seven sets of coefficients ( up to the fifteen - point formula ) are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "coefficients @xmath25 up to @xmath40 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we list some of the computed results .",
    "we observe that the traditional cn method ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) has a low precision and that using greater @xmath43 ( smaller @xmath6 ) results in modest gain in precision . by using higher - order time formula",
    "one can make significant gain in precision ( seven orders of magnitude ) with no increase in computational time compared with that of ref .",
    "( compare the first row to the last two rows of table  [ table4 ] . )",
    "rows 5 through 9 of table  [ table4 ] illustrate the transition from less precise to more precise solutions .",
    "it is consistent with the finding of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who use an @xmath44 , @xmath45 method and obtain two orders of magnitude improvement of the results of refs .",
    "the results are sensitive to surprisingly high orders of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "another test using wavepacket scattering to show the efficacy of the higher - order approach is scattering from a potential .",
    "rather than using the square barrier of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the repulsive pschl - teller type potential  @xcite of the form @xmath46 since this potential does not have discontinuities the improved cn method works well with it .",
    "the transmission and reflection coefficients are known analytically .",
    "we can also compute them by considering the wavepacket eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.5 ] ) incident on the potential . over a sufficiently long time",
    "the wavepacket will have interacted with the potential and transmitted and reflected packets emerge and travel away from the potential region . at that point",
    "we can calculate the probabilities of the particle represented by the packet on the left and on the right of the potential ; these probabilities correspond to the transmission and reflection coefficients provided the packet is sufficiently narrow in momentum space .",
    "this means that one needs an initial packet which is wide in coordinate space . in our calculation",
    "we choose @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "this gives a spread in the incident momentum - space wave packet of @xmath51 .",
    "the width in momentum space of the reflected and transmitted wavepackets also has this value .",
    "the domain of the @xmath30 coordinates is from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and the initial position of the packet is at @xmath54 to ensure that there is no overlap of the initial packet and the potential .",
    "we find good agreement between the transmission and reflections probabilities determined by plane - wave scattering approach and the time - dependent calculation as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] .",
    "there are few analytically solvable models of the time evolution of unstable quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "realistic systems need to be solved numerically .",
    "long - time calculations are required for systems which require both nuclear and atomic time - scales such as ionization and bremsstrahlung due to radioactive decay of the nucleus of an atom  @xcite . to study",
    "the short - time anomalous power law behavior of the decay and the long - time inverse - power law behavior the method of this paper is appropriate .",
    "this is especially relevant because of the recently observed violation of the exponential - decay law at long times  @xcite .    to illustrate the numerical method discussed in this paper",
    "as applied to decaying systems let us consider a variant of the model with a @xmath55-shell potential  @xcite , but with the @xmath55 function replaced by a gaussian .",
    "thus in the @xmath56 partial wave of a spherical system the potential is @xmath57},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the radial coordinate .",
    "this potential reduces to the @xmath55-shell potential , @xmath59 when @xmath60 . for small but finite values of @xmath61",
    "this potential leads to scattering results which are good approximations of those of the @xmath55-shell interaction  .",
    "initially the quantum system is in the state @xmath62 in our example we take @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . using the numerical method of this paper , including the modification of matrix @xmath68 as described in sec .",
    "[ bc ] to take care of the boundary conditions at @xmath69 , we determine the wave function at later times , i.e. , @xmath70 . from that we obtain the nonescape probability , as a function of @xmath16 , @xmath71 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] .",
    "it clearly shows the exponential decay - region in time , the inverse power - law behavior for long times , the deviation from exponential decay at short times , and the transition regions  @xcite .    the quadratic short - time behavior is seen in fig .",
    "[ figure_2 ] as is the inverse power law behavior at long times  @xcite .",
    "remarkably the decaying system can be studied in this manner for a time exceeding thirty half - lives . in fig .",
    "[ figure_3 ] we plot the square of the absolute value of the wave function at times @xmath72 .",
    "notice that the wave function ( packet ) has three distinct regions : a precursor due to energy components of the initial wave function larger than that associated with the exponential decay , the main packet which corresponds to the exponential decay at the resonance energy , and the follower , which is a small blip that stretches in time ( travels more slowly ) and is due to energy components in the initial wave function which have lower energy that the resonance energy .",
    "if the maximum spatial coordinate , which is set at 800 for this calculation , were set at a smaller value , say 400 , then one observes a fuzziness in the precursor of the right - most wave function .",
    "this can be attributed to the finite space in which the wavepacket travels so that the fast precursor has been partially reflected from the right boundary and interferes with the wave front of the main wavepacket .",
    "the numerical parameters for this calculation are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the generalized cn method that we have presented in this paper gives many orders of magnitude improvement in the precision of the results and several orders of magnitude in the computational time required to obtain the results .",
    "clearly , since this method enhances the efficiency of the numerical calculations , it can be a significant tool for studying time - dependent processes .",
    "it goes beyond the improvement of ref .",
    "@xcite in a systematic way .",
    "it also is an advance over the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the numerov method has an error @xmath10 , and it is difficult to see how it can be generalized systematically to higher order spatial errors .",
    "the generalized time evolution algorithm can be applied to moyer s  @xcite method .",
    "we have applied the method for @xmath2 and @xmath3 up to and including 20 for both .",
    "having achieved significant improvements with these values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 we did not consider larger values although there does not seem to be a practical reason that this can not be done .",
    "although the approach seems to saturate at @xmath2 around 10 ( see table  [ table3 ] ) , there is no visible saturation in the time - evolution part of the problem .",
    "one would expect higher orders of spatial errors to be significant when the wave function and/or the potential has large spatial fluctuations .",
    "even so , at @xmath40 we are using a 15-point formula for the second - order spatial derivative , and it is surprising that a smaller number of points in the formula is not sufficient for optimal results in this case .",
    "it should be noted that the higher order method as discussed in this paper are suitable only for well - behaved , sufficiently differentiable solutions ; these occur when the potential function is well behaved . as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite point out for singular functions higher - order methods do not necessarily lead to greater accuracy .",
    "it should be noted that in this paper we consider primarily one - dimensional systems , but the method applies equally well to partial - wave equations of two- or three - dimensional systems .",
    "the study of the decaying quasi - stable state is an example of the latter .",
    "an interesting avenue to investigate further is the impact that this approach may have on two- or three - dimensional systems , where the number of variables involved is equal to the dimension .",
    "the peaceman - rachford - type approach  @xcite , also known as the alternating - direction implicit method , of factoring the approximation of the time evolution operator may apply as it did in refs .",
    "@xcite or more recently in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . using the crank - nicolson method the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite show that in two dimension the kinetic energy parts of the evolution operator factorizes . whether such factorization can be generalized in the spirit of the method of this paper",
    "is under investigation .",
    "preliminary studies with the numerov spatial integration scheme  @xcite and the generalized time evolution as described in this work indicate that significant improvements occur if one incorporates appropriate changes in the spatial step size for different regions of space .",
    "this is important in the case of discontinuous potentials and potentials that have great variation in some region and little or no variation in other regions .",
    "furthermore it is well known that the wavepacket has large fluctuation in a ( short - range ) potential region and little variation in the asymptotic regions .",
    "a great savings in computational time can be achieved by using different space - step sizes in the different regions .",
    "one needs to investigate whether such variable step size can be incorporated in the generalized spatial integration scheme of this paper .",
    "the approach that dealt with the discontinuous first- or second - order derivative in this paper and ref .",
