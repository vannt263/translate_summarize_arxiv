    "the negativities of the minor identify nonclassical light fields , even if details of the detector response , such as its nonlinearities , are unknown .",
    "minor ( @xmath182 ) is shown for an odd coherent state depending on @xmath183 .",
    "the response functions are @xmath172 ( solid , scaling @xmath184 ) , @xmath185 ( dashed , scaling @xmath48 ) , and @xmath186 $ ] ( dotted , scaling @xmath187 ) . , width=302 ]",
    "in summary , we formulated a hierarchy of conditions for nonclassical correlations measured with on - off detector systems .",
    "these criteria have been formulated in terms of matrices of moments .",
    "each principal minor of this matrix can identify nonclassical quantum states , if it becomes negative .",
    "we demonstrated that higher order moments can detect quantum effects beyond the second - order criterion .",
    "let us stress that these moments are based solely on the measured click - counting statistics ; a pseudoinversion to the photon statistics is superfluous .",
    "we generalized these conditions to correlation measurements of joint click counting statistics for multiple detector systems .",
    "based on this method , quantum correlations between radiation fields can be revealed .",
    "we have shown that a generalized detection theory can be applied to systems of on - off detectors .",
    "the binomial behavior of joint click counting of coherent light is unchanged for different types of response functions , even for a nonlinear detection model .",
    "the corresponding nonclassicality criteria hold true and can be directly applied .",
    "quantum effects can be identified by our method , although some features of the detector  such as the response behavior  might be unknown .",
    "in addition , we outlined that the matrix of moments allows a general space - time - dependent identification of quantum effects .",
    "for this reason , we studied the description of the click counting statistics for time - dependent measurement processes .",
    "altogether , on the basis of our method a more efficient application of multiplexing and array detectors becomes feasible .",
