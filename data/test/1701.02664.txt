    "looking at people ( lap ) is a challenging area of research that deals with the problem of automatically recognizing people in images , detecting and describing body parts , inferring their spatial configuration , performing action / gesture recognition from still images or image sequences , often including multi - modal data .",
    "any scenario where the visual or multi - modal analysis of people takes a key role is of interest within the , so called , field of looking at people  @xcite .    because of the huge configuration space of human bodily structure , posture , and movement , human analysis is a difficult problem for computer vision and machine learning , which involves dealing with numerous distortion factors , including : illumination changes , partial occlusions , changes in the point of view , rigid and elastic deformations , or high inter and intra - class variability . despite the high difficulty of the problem ,",
    "modern computer vision and machine learning techniques have advanced greatly the state - of - the - art and therefore deserve further attention .",
    "our selection of tasks when organizing new events is motivated both by academic interest and by potential applications , such as tv production , home entertainment ( multimedia content analysis ) , education purposes , sociology research , surveillance and security , improved quality live by means of monitoring or automatic artificial assistance , etc .",
    "academic interest in illustrated by new burgeoning subareas of lap , such as affective computing , social signal processing , human behavior analysis , and social robotics , providing us with opportunities to make connections with other domains and expose the computer vision and machine learning community to new problems of high practical and societal interest .",
    "these objectives were first illustrated in 2011 when chalearn lap organized its first event on one - shot multi - modal gesture recognition from rgb - depth data sources . since then",
    ", chalearn lap has organized over 10 international challenges in the field of lap , including face analysis , body posture , action / gesture analysis , including still images , image sequences , and multi - modal data sources , and focusing in cutting edge trends in computer vision and pattern recognition , like explainable computer vision , personality analysis , and collaborative competitions ( a.k.a .",
    "_ coopetitions _ ) .    in this paper we briefly review the events organized so far , which are not limited to challenges , but also include , workshops , special issues , and book series .",
    "we also introduce the new chalearn lap platform , which contains all information and resources from previous and current events , including programs , papers , codes , and data , among others .",
    "finally , we discuss about near future plans within chalearn lap series .",
    "chalearn http://chalearn.org is a non - profit organization with vast experience in the organization of academic challenges .",
    "chalearn is interested in all aspects of challenge organization , including data gathering procedures , evaluation protocols , novel challenge scenarios ( e.g. , coopetitions ) , training for challenge organizers , challenge analytics , results dissemination and , ultimately , advancing the state - of - the - art through challenges .",
    "since 2003 , chalearn has been organizing a number of challenges in several interrelated fields , including machine learning , computer vision , pattern recognition , causality and bioinformatics .",
    "the first challenge we organized was the nips 2003 feature selection challenge , and currently several challenges are running ( please visit chalearn s website for update information on ongoing and past challenges  http://chalearn.org ) .",
    "chalearn lap is a division of chalearn that focuses in challenges in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition .",
    "this section reviews the historic of chalearn lap events .",
    "we split them into challenges and their associated workshops , special issues , and challenges in machine learning ( ciml ) springer book series .",
    "table  [ tablesummary ] summarizes the list of challenges and their associated workshops and special issues .",
    "next , we briefly review the organized competitions in the period 2011 - 2016 .",
    "kinect revolutionized in 2010 the field of gesture recognition , and had a broad impact into other lap areas .",
    "it i a valuable resource as it provides a variety of data modalities , including rgb image , depth image ( using an infrared sensor ) , and audio . for this reason the first three challenges organized by chalearn lap relied on the use and exploitation of such rich information .",
    "first , we organized a challenge on gesture and sign language recognition from video , mostly focusing on hand and arm gestures , although facial expressions and whole body motion may enter into account  @xcite , with funding from darpa , nsf , and the pascal2 eu network of excellence , and prizes donated by microsoft xbox and texas instrument .",
    "we used the kaggle platform .",
    "applications include recognizing signals for man - machine communication , translating sign languages for the deaf to hearing people , and computer gaming .",
    "the challenge focused in one - shot gesture recognition ( i.e. , learning models from a single example ) , and included qualitative and quantitative tracks .",
    "a large  user - independent \" dataset ( of over 60000 gestures ) covering a high number of domains and gesture categories was released  @xcite , and the leveinstein metric was used as a quantitative measure for ranking participants .",
    "dozens of participants joined the competition that lasted more than one year .",
    "although the impulse for the design of this challenge and part of the funding was given by the darpa deep learning program , _ no deep learning method _ was applied ! rather , more conventional combinations of ad hoc feature extraction methods and hidden markov models dominated the methodology of top ranking participants .",
    "the _ no deep learning revolution _ caught up right after this first challenge !",
    "chalearn lap organized in 2013 a challenge and workshop on multi - modal gesture recognition from 2d and 3d video data using kinect  @xcite . in this challenge and all following ones , we used the codalab platform running on microsoft azure , with the support of microsoft research .",
    "new in this competition was the user independent aspect capturing applications of gesture recognition genuinely important in many multi - modal interaction and computer vision applications , including image / video indexing , video surveillance , computer interfaces , and gaming .",
    "user - independent recognition of continuous , natural signing is very challenging due to the multimodal nature of the visual cues ( e.g. , movements of fingers and lips , facial expressions , body pose ) , as well as technical limitations such as spatial and temporal resolution and unreliable depth cues .",
    "we ran a competition containing a dataset with more than 13000 gesture samples from a dictionary of 20 italian sign gesture categories .",
    "for the first time in video lap challenges deep learning methods won ! an interesting finding from this challenge was that the audio modality was very helpful for recognizing gestures .",
    "chalearn organized in 2014 three parallel challenge tracks on human pose recovery on rgb data , action / interaction spotting on rgb data , and gesture spotting on rgb - depth data  @xcite .",
    "+ the challenge featured three quantitative tracks : +    * track 1 : human pose recovery . more than 8,000 frames of continuous rgb sequences are recorded and labeled with the objective of performing human pose recovery by means of recognizing more than 120000 human limbs of different people . * track 2 : action / interaction recognition .",
    "235 performances of 11 action / interaction categories are recorded and manually labeled in continuous rgb sequences of different people performing natural isolated and collaborative actions randomly .",
    "* track 3 : gesture recognition .",
    "more than 14000 gestures are drawn from a vocabulary of 20 italian sign gesture categories .",
    "the emphasis of this third track is on multi - modal automatic learning of a set of 20 gestures performed by several different users , with the aim of performing user independent continuous gesture spotting .    during this challenge ,",
    "the state of the art was significantly advanced in the three tracks , where solutions based in deep learning obtained the best results .      after the boom of kinect and the fact that human - level performance was reached in several tasks / challenges involving kinect - recorded data , chalearn lap started to look at open challenges in relevant fields that have to do with still and sequences of rgb images .",
    "chalearn organized in 2015 parallel challenge tracks on rgb data for human pose recovery , action / interaction spotting , and cultural event recognition  @xcite .",
    "the challenge featured three quantitative tracks :    * track 1 : human pose recovery . more than 8,000 frames of continuous rgb sequences are recorded and labeled with the objective of performing human pose recovery by means of recognizing more than 120,000 human limbs of different people . * track 2 : action / interaction recognition .",
    "235 performances of 11 action / interaction categories are recorded and manually labeled in continuous rgb sequences of different people performing natural isolated and collaborative actions randomly . *",
    "track 3 : cultural event recognition .",
    "more than 10000 images corresponding to 50 different cultural event categories will be considered . in all the categories , garments , human poses , objects and context",
    "will be possible cues to be exploited for recognizing the events , while preserving the inherent inter- and intra - class variability of this type of images .",
    "examples of cultural events will be carnival , oktoberfest , san fermin , maha - kumbh - mela and aoi - matsuri , among others .",
    "chalearn organized for iccv2015 two parallel quantitative challenge tracks on rgb data  @xcite .    * track 1 : apparent age estimation .",
    "5000 images each displaying a single individual , labeled with the apparent age .",
    "each image has been labeled by multiple individuals using a collaborative facebook implementation .",

    "* track 2 : accessories classification .",
    "the aim of this track is to detect and classify complements and accessories worn by the subjects .",
    "it uses a fraction of the faces of the world dataset , a challenging dataset consiting of 8000 images , each displaying a single individual , labelled with the accessories they are wearing .",
    "* track 3 : smile and gender classification . in this track",
    ", participants will have to classify images of the fotw dataset according to gender ( male , female or other ) and basic expression ( smiling , neutral or other expression ) .",
    "along with accurate face detection and aligment , this track will require robust feature selection and extraction in order to identify the subject s gender and expression , which can be difficult to classify even to the human eye in uncontrolled environments such as those present in the fotw dataset .",
    "research advances in computer vision and pattern recognition have resulted in tremendous advances in different problems and applications . as a result ,",
    "several problems on visual analysis can be considered as solved ( e.g. , face recognition ) , at least in certain scenarios and under specific circumstances . despite these important advances ,",
    "there are still many open problems that are receiving much attention from the community because of the potential applications .",
    "for that reason , chalearn lap has started to focus on problems going beyond the information visually depicted in videos .",
    "first , co - located with the workshop we organized a challenge on  first impressions \" , in which participants developed solutions for recognizing personality traits of users in short video sequences  @xcite .",
    "we made available a large newly collected dataset sponsored by microsoft of at least 10000 15-second videos collected from youtube , annotated with personality traits by amt workers .",
    "the traits correspond to the  big five \" personality traits used in psychology and well known of hiring managers using standardized personality profiling : extroversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism , and openness to experience .",
    "as is known , the first impression made is highly important in many contexts , such as human resourcing or job interviews .",
    "this work could become very relevant to training young people to present themselves better by changing their behavior in simple ways .      in the same line , we organized a contest around four lap problems that require , in addition to performing an effective visual analysis , to deal with multimodal information ( e.g. , audio , rgb - d video , etc . ) in order to be solved  @xcite .",
    "these four tracks included a second round on the first impressions challenge .",
    "the contest was supported by three organizations with vast experience and prestige in the organization of academic contests , namely : chalearn , mediaeval and imageclef .",
    "the contest was also supported by the iapr tc 12 on visual and multimedia information systems .",
    "+ the tracks of the contest were as follows :    * track 1 : first impressions challenge .",
    "participants developed solutions for recognizing personality traits of users in short video sequences .",
    "this corresponds to the second round of the first impressions challenge organized at eccv 2016  @xcite .",
    "* track 2 : isolated gesture recognition track .",
    "we organized a track on isolated gesture recognition from rgb - d data , where the goal was to develop methods for recognizing the category of human gestures from segmented rgb - d video .",
    "a new dataset called chalearn lap rgb - d isolated gesture dataset ( isogd ) was considered for this track  @xcite .",
    "this dataset includes 47933 rgb - d gesture videos ( about 9 g ) .",
    "each rgb - d video depicts a single gesture and there are 249 gesture categories performed by 21 different individuals . *",
    "track 3 : continuous gesture recognition track .",

    "each rgb - d video depicts one or more gestures and there are 249 gesture categories performed by 21 different individuals . *",
    "track 4 : context of experience track .",
    "the aim was to explore the suitability of video content for watching in certain situations .",
    "specifically , we look at the situation of watching movies on an airplane . as a viewing context",
    ", airplanes are characterized by small screens and distracting viewing conditions .",
    "we assume that movies have properties that make them more or less suitable to this context .",
    "we were interested in developing systems that are able to reproduce a general judgment of viewers about whether a given movie is a good movie to watch during a flight .",
    "we provided a dataset including a list of movies and human judgments concerning their suitability for airplanes  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the task was to use movie metadata and audio - visual features extracted from movie trailers in order to automatically reproduce these judgments .",
    "the provided dataset comprised : a total of 318 movies + metadata + audio ( mfcc ) , textual ( td - idf ) and visual ( hog , cm , lbp , glrlm ) features + movie . video resolution : full hd 1080p , with length of around 2 - 5 minutes , the considered categories are : latest , recent , the collection , family , world , dutch and european .      together with the challenges and their associated workshops , we organized a series of special issues and special topics related to lap in prestigious journals . in the following",
    "we provide a summary of each of them .",
    "we organized a special topic on gesture recognition at journal of machine learning research .",
    "the scope of this special issue included : algorithms for gesture and activity recognition , in particular addressing : learning from unlabeled or partially labeled data ; learning from few examples per class , and transfer learning ; continuous gesture recognition and segmentation deep learning architectures , including convolutional neural networks ; gesture recognition in challenging scenes , including cluttered / moving backgrounds or cameras ; large scale gesture recognition o multi - modal features for gesture recognition , including non - conventional input sources , such as inertial , depth or thermal data ; integrating information from multiple channels ( e.g. , position / motion of multiple body parts , hand shape , facial expressions ) ; applications in video surveillance , image or video indexing and retrieval , recognition of sign languages for the deaf , emotion recognition and affective computing , computer interfaces , virtual reality , robotics , ambient intelligence , and games .",
