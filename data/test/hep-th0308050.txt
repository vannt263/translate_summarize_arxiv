    "there have been several occasions in string theory where the study of string dynamics near certain corners of the moduli space of the theory has led to some new insights in field theory .",
    "one of the most known examples is the emergence of spacetime noncommutative field theories from string theory in the presence of an ns - ns background field @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "another example has been provided more recently by the work of seiberg @xcite ( and also @xcite ) , inspired by earlier works of ooguri and vafa @xcite in the context of the gauge theory/ matrix model correspondence ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "both these works ( as well as some others such as @xcite ) have derived a new type of non(anti)commutative field theories from string theory in the presence of a constant graviphoton background field . these can be formulated as field theories on a superspace whose grassmann odd supercoordinates obey a clifford like algebra , rather than the usual ( anti)commutation relations .",
    "this type of noncommutativity had also been considered earlier mainly from an algebraic point of view @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is an alternative deformation in contrast to the ordinary noncommutativity among the bosonic coordinates of superspace @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the work by seiberg has initiated a new trend of research on various aspects of field theories formulated on such deformed superspaces , which usually ( in a 4-dimensional context ) are known as @xmath6 theories @xcite ( for a partial list see @xcite-@xcite ) . in particular , the deformations of some @xmath5 theories ( with @xmath7 susy ) , such as the wz model and sym theories with or without matter have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the deformation of @xmath8 symtheories ( with @xmath9 susy ) has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "some perturbative aspects of this class of theories , such as their renormalizability , has been recently studied in a number of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of these papers deal with formulation of deformed theories in a euclidean superspace .",
    "the minkowskian case has been considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "a combination of the noncommutativity among both the bosonic and fermionc coordinates of superspace has also been studied in @xcite .    while by now a rather rich collection of information on perturbative aspects of the deformed theories on non(anti)commutative superspaces has been obtained , yet less has been known about their non - perturbative aspects such as their solitonic solutions of the form of lumps , monopoles , instantons , etc .",
    "( see however the comments in @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting , for example , to know to what extent such solutions parallel their counterparts in the ordinary noncommutative field theories @xcite ( for a review of the latter see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as a first step in this direction , in this paper we explicitly work out the example of 1/2 supersymmetric bps solutions in a deformed wess - zumino model in 2 dimensions ,",
    "whose commutative counterpart has been studied long ago by witten and olive @xcite@xmath10 in 2 dimensional deformed wz model , as in its 4-dimensional counterpart , a modification proportional to @xmath1 ( with @xmath11 as the auxiliary component of the scalar superfield ) arises which breaks all the @xmath5 supercharges explicitly . but here , unlike in 4-dimensional case , also a kinetic part for @xmath11 appears which makes it a dynamical field in contrast to the undeformed theory and it also breaks the whole supersymmetry explicitly .",
    "the reason why we adhere to 2 spacetime dimensions is that the deformation of superspace by non - anticommuting odd coordinates in a theory in any dimensions does _ not _ violate the conditions of derrick theorem @xcite , as it does not bring higher order derivatives into the spacetime formulation of the theory . as a result , scalar solitons ( or lumps ) can indeed do exist _ only _ in 2 spacetime dimensions just as the case in the undeformed theory .",
    "this is in contrast to the ordinary noncommutative solitons where the violation of derrick theorem due to higher order derivatives allows for the existence of scalar solitons in higher spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned above , in the 2-dimensional case , the deformation breaks both the two supersymmetries of the theory as a result of the fact that 2-dimensional susy generators do _ not _ anti - commute with the grassmann odd derivatives appearing in the definition of the deforming star product algebra . in the same spirit of @xcite",
    ", we may like to call the deformed model as an @xmath12 or non - supersymmetric theory .",
    "however , we shall find that , on a certain surface relating the auxiliary and scalar fields ( called as the `` orbit '' ) , the model still preserves the @xmath5 susy somehow non - linearly .",
    "this should be compared to a non - linear realization of the broken @xmath13 susy in the case of the 4-dimensional deformed @xmath8 sym  theory found in @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is a follows : in sec.2 we review some elementary facts about the deformed algebra of functions of two grassmann odd variables .",
    "we then introduce in sec.3 the deformed generators of the @xmath14 susy and the corresponding superderivatives on the basis of which we construct the deformed wz model . in sec.4",
    "we obtain the modified bps equation governing continuous deformation of the ordinary bps solutions in the undeformed wz  model and solve them to first order in the deformation parameter .",
    "in sec.5 we obtain an expressions for a classical effective superpotential arising in the deformed wz model , using which we compute the deformation of the usual bps mass formula . finally ,",
    "in sec.6 we show that the @xmath5 susy has a non - linear realization in terms of an effective non - linear @xmath15-model describing the dynamics on a relevant orbit in the deformed theory .",
    "in this section we review some basic facts regarding the deformed algebra of functions of two grassmann odd variables @xmath16 defining a @xmath17 spinor , corresponding to the algebra of superfields on a deformed @xmath18 @xmath19 euclidean superspace ( we will use notations of .",
    "the starting point for defining the deformed algebra is the non(anti)commutation relation between the odd variables , written as the clifford algebra @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is a constant bispinor and the hats are used to interpret @xmath22 s here as operators . defining the algebra of functions of odd coordinates via the odd star product as @xcite @xmath23 one then finds a representation of the clifford algebra ( [ 1 ] ) on the space of ordinary ( anticommuting ) grassmann odd variables . here the left and right differentiations on a function @xmath24 of even or odd grassmann party are simply related as @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 even or odd , respectively .",
    "we have to stress that distinguishing between the left and right differentiations in eq.([2 ] ) is important in order to have explicit isomorphism between the algebra ( [ 2 ] ) and the clifford algebra and in proving the associativity of the star product .",
    "in particular , it can be easily verified that @xmath28 ( note that in our 2d case the term @xmath29 in the second relation identically vanishes . ) using the ordinary rules of the grassmann calculus one can then see that the above defining equation for the star product terminates at a finite order of @xmath30 s .",
    "in particular , the exponential expansion in this equation takes the simple form @xmath31 where now a grassmannian derivative is understood to act from the left ( i.e. @xmath32 ) and we have introduced the notation @xmath33 ( with @xmath34)@xmath10    also , similar to the case of the ordinary ( bosonic ) star product @xcite , one can show that the `` inner product '' of two functions of @xmath22 is independent of @xmath35 , namely @xmath36 which corresponds to the fact that the difference @xmath37 is a total grassmannian derivative not surviving the grassmannian integrations .",
    "often we denote this equivalence relation symbolically as @xmath38 .",
    "we can find explicit expressions for powers of @xmath24 under the star product using the general expression given in eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "for this , we first recall the basic expression @xmath39 from which , for example , the third power of @xmath27 follows as @xmath40 ,   \\label{8}\\ ] ] and so forth for @xmath41 .",
    "we note that all such expressions can totally be written in terms of the second derivatives of @xmath27 and @xmath42 using the identity @xmath43 in this 2-dimensional case , further simplifications occur in computing higher powers of @xmath27 ( or generally any function of @xmath27 ) due to the fact that @xmath44 of every function of @xmath22 is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "a generic feature of such expressions for @xmath45 is that they depend on @xmath35 only through its determinant @xmath46 , which is a lorentz invariant quantity .",
    "also all such expressions contain a total derivative part which can be neglected upon grassmannian integrations .",
    "often we can separate the total derivative part of @xmath41 using the lemma @xmath47 and the above expression for @xmath48 .",
    "for example , using @xmath49 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\int d^{2}\\theta \\;f_{*}^{4 } & = & \\int d^{2}\\theta \\;(f_{*}^{2})^{2}=\\int d^{2}\\theta \\;\\left [ f^{2}-\\frac{1}{4}\\det c\\left ( \\frac{\\partial ^{2}f}{% \\partial \\theta ^{2}}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] ^{2 } ,   \\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we conclude the identities @xmath50 as these expressions suggest , ignoring total derivative terms , the deformed version of @xmath51 ( as well as for any analytic function of @xmath27 ) is always written as a polynomial ( generally a power series ) in powers of @xmath52 .",
    "it is indeed this beauty of the star product in reducing all the @xmath3-dependence to the lorentz invariant combination @xmath52 which causes a great deal of simplicity in formuation of a deformed wess - zumino model in 2-dimensions in later sections .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the deformation defined by @xmath35 does not break lorentz invariance of the low energy field theory @xcite .",
    "consider first the ordinary susy transformations acting on a superfield @xmath53 via the generators in terms of the 2-dimensional dirac matrices are written as @xmath54 . ]",
    "@xmath55 which in components are written as @xmath56 the deformed susy is defined as the transformations generated by acting @xmath57 s on @xmath58 via the star product operation , namely by @xmath59 this amounts to defining the deformed generators @xmath60 as @xmath61 or in components @xmath62 the algebra obeyed by the deformed generators simply follows from these expressions to be @xmath63 this can be thought as a closed algebra if one considers @xmath64 on its r.h.s . as the `` new '' operators , which commute with @xmath65 .",
    "the deformed supertranslation algebra ( [ 17 ] ) is in contrast to another one proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) via introducing a gauge connection on superspace .    in a similar fashion",
    "we can define the deformed supercovariant derivatives based on the corresponding undeformed derivatives , namely @xmath66 one can verify that ( unlike in the undeformed case as well as in the deformed 4d case @xcite ) these have nonvanishing anticommutators with the deformed susy generators , @xmath67",
    "so , after all , any superspace lagrangian constructed on the basis of the deformed superderivatives will not be invariant under the deformed susy transformations . using these derivatives , however",
    ", the most natural definition for the deformed version of the kinetic term of a real scalar superfield @xmath68 is written as follows @xmath69=d_{+}s*d_{-}s\\cong d_{+}sd_{-}s .",
