    "over the last more than three decades ferroelectric liquid crystals ( flcs ) have attracted considerable attention as promising chiral liquid crystal materials for applications in fast switching display devices ( a detailed description of flcs can be found , e.g. , in monographs  @xcite ) .",
    "equilibrium orientational structures in flcs are represented by helical twisting patterns where flc molecules align on average along a local unit director @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the smectic tilt angle ; @xmath4 is the twisting axis normal to the smectic layers and @xmath5 is the @xmath6-director .",
    "the flc director   lies on the smectic cone depicted in fig .",
    "[ subfig : director ] with the _ smectic tilt angle _ @xmath3 and rotates in a helical fashion about a uniform twisting axis @xmath4 forming the flc helix with the _ helix pitch _ , @xmath7 .",
    "this rotation is described by the azimuthal angle around the cone @xmath8 that specifies orientation of the @xmath6-director in the plane perpendicular to @xmath4 and depends on the dimensionless coordinate along the twisting axis @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the helix twist wave number .",
    "the important case of a uniform lying flc helix in the slab geometry with the smectic layers normal to the substrates and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electric field applied across the cell , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] .",
    "this is the geometry of surface stabilized flcs ( ssflcs ) pioneered by clark and lagerwall in  @xcite .",
    "they studied electro - optic response of flc cells confined between two parallel plates subject to homogeneous boundary conditions and made thin enough to suppress the bulk flc helix .",
    "it was found that such cells exhibit high - speed , bistable electro - optical switching between orientational states stabilized by surface interactions .",
    "the response of flcs to an applied electric field @xmath12 is characterized by fast switching times due to linear coupling between the field and the _ spontaneous ferroelectric polarization _",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the _ polarization unit vector_. there is also a threshold voltage necessary for switching to occur and the process of bistable switching is typically accompanied by a hysteresis .",
    "figure  [ subfig : cell ] also describes the geometry of deformed helix flcs ( dhflcs ) as it was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this case will be of our primary concern .    in dhflc cells ,",
    "the flc helix is characterized by a short submicron _ helix pitch _ , @xmath15  @xmath16 m , and a relatively large _ tilt angle _ , @xmath17  deg .",
    "by contrast to ssflc cells , where the surface induced unwinding of the bulk helix requires the helix pitch of a flc mixture to be greater than the cell thickness , a dhflc helix pitch is 5 - 10 times smaller than the thickness .",
    "this allows the helix to be retained within the cell boundaries .",
    "electro - optical response of dhflc cells exhibits a number of peculiarities that make them useful for lc devices such as high speed spatial light modulators  @xcite , colour - sequential liquid crystal display cells  @xcite and optic fiber sensors  @xcite .",
    "the effects caused by electric - field - induced distortions of the helical structure underline the mode of operation of such cells . in a typical experimental setup ,",
    "these effects are probed by performing measurements of the transmittance of normally incident linearly polarized light through a cell placed between crossed polarizers .",
    "a more general case of oblique incidence has not received a fair amount of attention . theoretically , a powerful tool to deal with this case is the transfer matrix method which has been widely used in studies of both quantum mechanical and optical wave fields  @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply the method for systematic treatment of the technologically important case of dhflcs with subwavelength pitch also known as the _ short - pitch dhflcs_.    recently , the transfer matrix approach to polarization gratings was employed to define the effective dielectric tensor of short - pitch dhflcs  @xcite that gives the principal values and orientation of the optical axes as a function of the applied electric field .",
    "biaxial anisotropy and rotation of the in - plane optical axes produced by the electric field can be interpreted as the _ orientational kerr effect _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it can be expected that the electric field dependence of the effective dielectric tensor will also manifest itself as electric - field - induced transformations of the polarization - resolved angular ( conoscopic ) patterns in the observation plane after the dhflc cells illuminated by convergent light beam .",
    "these patterns are represented by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fields of polarization ellipses describing the polarization structure behind the conoscopic images  @xcite .    as it was originally recognized by nye  @xcite , the key elements characterizing geometry of such stokes parameter fields are the _ polarization singularities _ that play the fundamentally important role of structurally stable topological defects ( a recent review can be found in ref .",
    "in particular , the polarization singularities such as the _ c points _ ( the points where the light wave is circular polarized ) and the _ l lines _ ( the curves along which the polarization is linear ) frequently emerge as the characteristic feature of certain polarization state distributions . for nematic and cholescteric ( chiral nematic ) liquid crystals , the singularity structure of the polarization - resolved angular patterns",
    "is generally found to be sensitive to both the director configuration and the polarization characteristics of incident light  @xcite .    in this study , we consider the polarization - resolved angular patterns of dhflc cells as the stokes parameter fields giving detailed information on the incidence angles dependence of the polarization state of light transmitted through the cells .",
    "in particular , we explore how the polarization singularities transform under the action of the electric field .",
    "our analysis will utilize the transfer matrix approach in combination with the results for the effective dielectric tensor of biaxial flcs evaluated using an improved technique of averaging over distorted helical structures .",
    "we also emphasize the role of phase singularities of a different kind and discuss the electro - optic behavior of dhflcs near the exceptional point where the condition of zero - field isotropy is fulfilled .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we introduce our notations and describe the transfer matrix formalism rendered into the @xmath18 matrix form suitable for our purposes .",
    "this formalism is employed to deduce a number of the unitarity and symmetry relations with emphasis on the planar anisotropic structures that represent dhflc cells and posses two optical axes lying in the plane of substrates . in sec .",
    "[ sec : optics - dhf ] we evaluate the effective dielectric tensor of dhflc cells , discuss the orientational kerr effect and show that electro - optic response of dhflc cells is enhanced near the exceptional point determined by the condition of zero - field isotropy .",

    "[ sec : conoscopy ] .",
    "after providing necessary details on our computational approach and the polarization singularities , we present the numerical results describing how the singularity structure of polarization ellipse fields transforms under the action of the electric field . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we draw the results together and make some concluding remarks .",
    "details on some technical results are relegated to appendixes  [ sec : op - evol][sec : flc - spiral ] .",
    "in order to describe both the electro - optical properties and the polarization - resolved angular patterns of deformed helix ferroelectric liquid crystal layers with subwavelength pitch we adapt a general theoretical approach which can be regarded as a modified version of the well - known transfer matrix method  @xcite and was previously applied to study the polarization - resolved conoscopic patterns of nematic liquid crystal cells  @xcite . this approach has also been extended to the case of polarization gratings and used to deduce the general expression for the effective dielectric tensor of dhflc cells  @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we present the transfer matrix approach as the starting point of our theoretical considerations , with emphasis on its general structure and the symmetry relations .",

    "<S> when the angle between this axis and the polarization plane of incident linearly polarized light is above its critical value , the @xmath1 points ( points of circular polarization ) appear in the form of symmetrically arranged chains of densely packed star - monstar pairs . </S>",
