    "the coupling between dynamical systems can give rise to a number of collective phenomena such as synchronization , phase locking , phase shifting @xcite , amplitude death @xcite , phase - flip @xcite , hysteresis @xcite , riddling @xcite and so on @xcite .",
    "since communication between the individual systems is mediated by signals that can have a finite transmission time , many studies account for this by the introduction of time  delay in the coupling @xcite .",

    "this issue is of added interest when studying hamiltonian systems where there can be a hierarchy of conserved quantities @xcite .",

    "we consider the following examples , that of diffusively coupled harmonic oscillators that models delay  coupled pendulums , for instance , and coupled hnon  heiles oscillators . in the absence of coupling , in the former case",
    "the motion is periodic , while in the latter case the dynamics can be ( quasi)periodic or chaotic . in both instances",
    "we find that the effect of introducing dissipation is to cause the oscillatory dynamics to be damped to a fixed point , namely we find that there is the so  called amplitude death ( ad ) @xcite as has been seen in delay  coupled dissipative dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "although the major effect of the coupling is to make the overall system dissipative , there are differences from the case when non - hamiltonian systems are coupled . when the dynamics is decaying to a point attractor , there is an abrupt transition in the relative phases of the oscillatory transient motion .",
    "this is the phase ",
    "flip transition that has been seen in a number of other systems @xcite . here , however , there are special values of the time ",
    "delay when the coupling term effectively vanishes : the underlying hamiltonian structure then becomes apparent .",
    "our main results are presented in sections ii and iii where we consider the cases of coupled harmonic oscillators and coupled hnon heiles systems respectively .",
    "we show how ad is reached and the nature of the phase - flip transition in both cases . since the uncoupled systems are hamiltonian , it is possible to define an energy , and while this quantity has been studied in coupled feedback oscillators @xcite as a tool to determine onset of ad , its variation in the ad regime itself has not been examined . in this work",
    "we do energy analysis in the ad region and find that the energy dissipation is non monotonic as a function of the coupling , decaying faster prior to the phase ",
    "flip transition and slower subsequently .",

    "1(a ) as b and d ) and remains negative for all other values of @xmath9 , implying that the system is driven to ad except when the delay is an integral multiple of half the time period .",

    "hence , in those systems the reappearance of oscillations after ad depends both on the coupling strength and on the delay , whereas in coupled hamiltonian systems we find that this happens only due to delay .    in the ad regime(s ) points of discontinuity in the slope of the largest le ( marked in fig .",
