    "most models of dark energy in the present universe predict that its effective equation of state satisfies the null energy condition ( nec ) @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the effective dark energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "however , the observations do not rule out that dark energy is phantom , i.e. , it violates nec . as an example , the 7-year wmap+bao+sn data @xcite give the following bound on the equation of state with time - dependent @xmath4 at @xmath5 : @xmath6 which is not entirely inconsistent with @xmath7 .",
    "even though phantom dark energy can be accomodated within general relativity @xcite , it is legitimate to ask whether effective phantom behavior can be obtained in modified gravity theories , such as @xmath8 or scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "this question can be addressed , in particular , within a popular approach  @xcite employing the reconstruction of model parameters from the redshift expansion of observables , combined with the experimental constraints on non - gr gravity .",
    "the main conclusion is that with current observational data , the reconstructed de behaves more or less like the cosmological constant , but it is still possible to have phantom stage today .    in this paper",
    "we follow a somewhat different route and ask what sort of the scalar - tensor lagrangian can lead to effective phantom de at the present epoch without violating constraints from solar system and local gravity experiments , time-(in)dependence of the gravity constant , etc .",
    "we also ask whether fine - tuning of initial data is necessary and how long the duration of the phantom stage can be in the past .",
    "our results are somewhat disappoining .",
    "we find that models with the present phantom de can be made consistent with all constraints , but one of the functions entering the scalar - tensor lagrangian must have rather specific shape , and the initial data must be strongly fine - tuned .",
    "also , the phantom stage must have begun fairly recently , at @xmath0 . before that the scalar field was undistinguishable from quintessence .",
    "all this disfavors the effective phantom behaviour in the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "in fact , as we point out towards the end of this paper , some of the unpleasant properties we discuss must be present in scalar - tensor models for effective dark energy irrespectively of whether it is phantom or not .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the equations governing the homogeneous cosmological evolution in the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "we recall in section iii the experimental constraints on the non - gr gravity , that place bounds on the parameters of the theory . in section",
    "iv we define the expansion coefficients of the functions entering the lagrangian and reformulate the bounds of section iii in terms of these coefficients . in section",
    "v we put together all consistency requirements for the effective phantom dark energy today and arrive at qualitative understanding of the properties of the functions defining the theory . also , the maximum redshift at which the phantom phase could begin is estimated .",
    "section vi contains a numerical example .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "by definition , the effective dark energy density and pressure @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the quantities entering the gr - looking evolution equations for the homogeneous and isotropic universe , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are matter energy density and pressure , and we set @xmath14 . using ( [ e : fri1 ] ) and ( [ e : fri2 ] ) , one writes @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we are going to make use of this relation in the context of the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "the action of this theory is @xmath17 ( mostly positive signature ) , where the action for the usual matter @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "one can always redefine the field to have a convenient form of either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "we will use the general form of @xmath20 and set @xmath22    from the action  ( [ e : action ] ) one obtains the gravitational equations , @xmath23 and equation of motion for the field @xmath19 , @xmath24 let us specify to the homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe with metric @xmath25 since matter does not interact with @xmath19 , the scale factor @xmath26 has the same meaning as in gr . using eqs .",
    "( [ e : ein ] ) and ( [ e : phi ] ) one gets the following set of equations : @xmath27 the equation for the matter density has the usual form , @xmath28    it is convenient for futher analysis to switch from the evolution in time to the evolution in redshift .",
    "this can be done by using the relation @xmath29 in this way one obtains from  ( [ e : fr1j ] ) , ( [ e : fr2j ] ) and ( [ e : phj ] ) the evolution equations in terms of redshift : @xmath30f ' \\label{e : fr2z}\\\\ h^{2}(1+z)^{2}\\phi''&+[hh'(1+z)^{2}-2h^{2}(1+z)]\\phi'=3[2h^{2}-hh'(1+z)]\\frac{f'}{\\phi'}-\\frac{u'}{\\phi ' } , \\label{e : phz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where prime denotes @xmath31 .",
    "the properties of functions defining the theory are strongly constrained by local and solar system experiments .",
    "this is a major problem for the effective nec - violating behavior in the scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "one important parameter is the brans  dicke `` constant '' @xmath32 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the expression for @xmath33 in our parametrization by redifining the scalar field .",
    "one finds @xmath34 the lower bound on the present value of @xmath33 is obtained from the kassini experiment @xcite .",
    "it reads ( the subscript @xmath35 denotes the quantities at the present epoch ) @xmath36 a bound of another sort follows from the experiments on the time dependence of the gravity constant . in our case the local gravity constant @xmath37 is given by  @xcite @xmath38 the experimental constraint on the time evolution of @xmath37 can be found in refs .",
    "for @xmath5 it reads @xmath39 we also know that the gravitational constant relevant for cosmology should not change significantly since big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , @xmath40 it is the latter constraint that plays a significant role in our analysis , see section v.",
    "a convenient way to analyze the evolution at small redshifts is to expand all functions in the taylor series in redshift @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , we are mainly interested in the dependence on @xmath19 , so we will use the mixed expansion . at @xmath5 , without loss of generality we choose @xmath42 and by definition of the newton gravity constant we have @xmath43 here is our definition of the expansion coefficients : @xmath44 without loss of generality we take @xmath45 . from eq .",
    "( [ e : fr1z ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the relation between the derivatives at the present time , @xmath46 we will also need @xmath47 and @xmath48 to obtain the expression for @xmath4 . from eqs .",

    "( [ wbd ] ) , and make use of eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) . with our normalization @xmath55",
    ", we get very strong upper bound on @xmath56 : @xmath57 this means that the field @xmath19 is presently near the extremum of the funcion @xmath20 .",
    "such a conclusion appears inevitable in modified gravity , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ phsh ] ) that @xmath58 , so eq .  ( [ e : f1 ] ) implies that @xmath59 is also small , latexmath:[\\[\\label{f1r }    the first derivative of @xmath50 in the analysis of the present epoch .",
    "we note in passing that a small value of @xmath61 could have been anticipated , since the gr tests are very precise , and only a slight deviation from gr can be tolerated today .",
    "using  ( [ phsh ] ) and neglecting the term with @xmath59 , we obtain for the present value of the field derivative with respect to redshift @xmath62 this simple relation will be instrumental in what follows .",
    "now we use the expression ( [ e : omega ] ) for @xmath63 to find out which parametrs can be responsible for the effective phantom behavior . making use of eqs .",
    "( [ e : f1]),([e : f2 ] ) and ( [ f1r ] ) we get @xmath64 by extracting the second derivative of the field from eq .",
    "( [ e : phz ] ) , we find @xmath65 so , there are essentially two parameters that could yield @xmath66 , namely , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we begin our discussion with the latter .",
    "the possible contribution of the potential to the phantom effective equation of state comes from the third term in ( [ ww0 ] ) ( the second term in the numerator is positive in virtue of eq .",
    "( [ ph2 ] ) ) and is given by @xmath69 it is strongly supressed by small @xmath56 , so this contribution can be sizeable only if the potential @xmath70 is very steep today .",
    "however , steep potential would lead to the rapid acceleration of the scalar field , so the phantom phase would be very short in the past .",
    "furthermore , the fast evolution of the scalar field together with large @xmath71 would imply rapid change in time of the effective dark energy density . to elaborate on the latter point ,",
    "let us consider the parameter @xmath72 observationally , @xmath73 is not large : the wmap analysis @xcite gives @xmath74 . on the other hand , making use of eq .",
    "( [ e : omega ] ) and neglecting the terms with @xmath75 we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are : @xmath79+\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{3(1-\\omega_{m,0})}\\left[12f_{2}+\\frac{3f_{2}^{2}}{2}+9f_{2}\\omega_{u,0}-\\frac{9}{2}f_{2}\\omega_{m,0 } -30\\omega_{u,0}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.+24(1-\\omega_{m,0})+6\\phantom{\\frac{1}{1}}\\right]-\\frac{1}{3(1-\\omega_{m,0})^{2}}\\left(-f_{2}+6\\omega_{u,0}+3\\omega_{m,0}-6\\right)^{2}. \\label{ww12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath80 can not be very large , see below , so for large @xmath81 the value of @xmath82 is controlled by @xmath77 term in the expression  ( [ ww1 ] ) . to have sizeable contribution ( [ mar10 - 1 ] ) and at the same time satisfy the observational constraint on @xmath82 , one would need the cancellation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which in turn would require strong fine - tuning . barring this possibility ,",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath85 , so the contribution ( [ mar10 - 1 ] ) is very small . from now on we neglect it .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ ww0 ] ) can be simplified by using  ( [ ph2 ] ) : @xmath86 thus , the phantom behaviour today is controlled entirely by @xmath87 .",
    "to have @xmath88 at the present time , one requires that @xmath89 together with the bound ( [ mar11 - 1 ] ) , this implies that today the field @xmath19 must be close to a relatively sharp maximum of the function @xmath20 . clearly , such a special state requires fine - tuning of both the function @xmath20 and initial conditions in the theory .",
    "we continue the discussion of the shape of @xmath20 and recall the constraints on the time - dependence of the gravity constant . given the small value of @xmath75 and large value of @xmath90 , the constraint ( [ gete ] ) is not hard to satisfy ;",
    "note that this is in contrast to ref .",
    "much less trivial is the fact that the `` cosmological '' gravity constant has not changed much since bbn .",
    "it is clear from ( [ e : fr1j ] ) that @xmath91 is simply equal to @xmath92 . barring strong cancellations , the constraint ( [ mar11 - 2 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ e : fr1z ] ) imply that the variation of @xmath20 has been small since bbn , @xmath93 and that @xmath94 is small at large @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath20 must have the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ ris : image ] .",
    "let us now estimate the range of redshifts in which the dynamics of @xmath50 is non - trivial , and the phantom effective equation of state can be realized .",
    "we do this by requiring that the value of @xmath50 does not change much during this period .",
    "since @xmath75 is small , the second term in the expansion of @xmath50 in redshift is relevant , and the estimate for maximum redshift is found from @xmath95 where the bound on @xmath96 is given in eq .",
    "( [ mar11 - 5 ] ) . making use of eq .",
    "( [ e : f2 ] ) we get @xmath97 let us denote by @xmath98 the deviation of @xmath4 from @xmath99 today : @xmath100 using ( [ ww ] ) we get the estimate @xmath101 , and hence from  ( [ g2 ] ) we find @xmath102 for reasonably strong phantom behavior ( i.e. , not very small @xmath98 ) , @xmath103 is fairly small ; roughly speaking , @xmath104 .",
    "note that similar result has been obtained within the reconstruction approach  @xcite . at larger redshfts ,",
    "@xmath50 is frozen out , and the scalar field @xmath19 reduces to quintessence .",
    "let us give a concrete example of a model with effective phantom behavior today and in the recent past .",
    "we note that the relatively large value of the parameter @xmath105 is obtained for fairly large @xmath106 , otherwise the maximum of @xmath50 must be very sharp ( i.e. , @xmath67 must be large ) , see eq .",
    "( [ ww ] ) .",
    "so , we take , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath107 .",
    "we choose @xmath108 , in rough agreement with observations , then eq .  (",
    "[ e : fr1z ] ) with @xmath109 gives @xmath110 .",
    "fairly strong phantom behavior , @xmath111 , is obtained with @xmath112 .",
    "the estimate ( [ zmax1 ] ) then gives @xmath113 . to satisfy all these requirements ,",
    "we choose @xmath20 as shown in fig .",
    "[ image3 ] .",
    "the shape of the potential @xmath70 is not constrained particularly strongly ; our choice is shown in fig .",
    "[ image6 ] .    with this choice ,",
    "the effective equation of state depends on redshift as shown in fig .",
    "[ image2 ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath4 rapidly tends to @xmath99 as @xmath41 increases , and the field @xmath19 becomes indistiguishable from quintessence at @xmath114 .",
    "the field value does not change much : the change from redshift 0.2 to the present epoch is about @xmath115 .",
    "we have constructed a number of other examples satisfying the constraints of section iii ; all of these examples have similar properties .",
    "as we already pointed out , effective phantom dark energy requires both the special form of the function @xmath20 and fine - tuning of the initial value of the field @xmath19 . to see the latter property explicitly ,",
    "let us take the same functions @xmath20 and @xmath70 as before and consider the evolution from redshift @xmath116 to @xmath5 for different initial values of the field .",
    "if we vary the initial condition for @xmath19 within 15% interval around the central value yielding fig .",
    "[ image2 ] ( without varying the initial velocity @xmath117 , for the sake of arument ) , the evolution changes considerably .",
    "in particular , the effective equation of state is as shown in fig .",
    "[ image8 ] .",
    "such a behaviour is not unexpected .",
    "the right choice of the initial value of the field ensures that the phantom phase begins in just right time , at some rather small redshift . for different initial values",
    ", the onset of the phantom behavior occurs at `` wrong '' redshifts , so one either has too large deviation of @xmath63 from @xmath99 , or no deviation at all .",
    "in this paper we revisited the question of the possibility of the present phantom phase in scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "we have seen that it is possible to obtain and control effective phantom behavior even in simple scalar - tensor models , but this requires a lot of fine - tuning .",
    "first , the large present value of the brans  dicke parameter is obtained only if the scalar field @xmath19 is presently near the extremum of the function @xmath50 determining the gravity constant .",
    "this is consistent with observable phantom property only if this extermum is a sharp maximum .",
    "second , the small variation of the gravity constant since bbn requires that @xmath50 flattens out at fairly low redshift .",
    "finally , the whole picture is consistent with observations only for fine - tuned initial data .",
    "we conclude by noting that some of the unpleasant properties discussed in this paper must be present in scalar - tensor models for effective dark energy irrespectively of whether it is phantom or not .",
    "this remark applies , in particular , to the contrived shape of the function @xmath50 and fine - tuning of initial conditions .",
    "indeed , the fact that @xmath118 must be small today does not rely on the assumption of the phantom behavior .",
    "furthermore , most of the analysis in section v goes through provided that @xmath119 is large enough at the present epoch , while the case @xmath120 corresponds to quintessence rather than genuine scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "all this makes scalar - tensor theory rather unlikely candidate for explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
