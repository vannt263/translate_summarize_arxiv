    "the thermodynamic limit in which the system size is taken to be infinite is beloved by theorists as many calculations in many - body physics become dramatically simplified in this limit .",
    "this must be contrasted with experimental work , in which one tends to make measurements on systems of a finite size . for bulk thermodynamic measurements",
    "this discrepancy is typically not important , the reason being that avogadro s number is so large as to be practically indistinguishable from infinity .",
    "for example , phase transitions are strictly speaking only true transitions in the thermodynamic limit where the free energy exhibits singularities , however their signatures becomes arbitrarily sharp in large but finite systems as to make this mathematical technicality irrelevant .",
    "as nanotechnology improves and nano - devices become smaller , finite - size corrections to the thermodynamic limit become more relevant .",
    "the same is true as computers improve and computational approaches become more commonplace . particularly for strongly correlated systems ,",
    "one often turns to methods based on exact diagonalization or stochastic sampling of the partition function ( monte - carlo methods ) , which tend to be limited to relatively small ( certainly compared to avogardo s number ) system sizes . to extrapolate from these results on small systems to systems of experimental relevance requires an understanding of the finite - size scaling ; even typical experimental nano - devices while tiny compared to bulk systems are large compared to the number of particles / sites that may be simulated in the fully quantum methods necessary for understanding strongly correlated systems .",
    "however one of the more fascinating results of modern theoretical physics is that , at least in a large class of models , the finite - size scaling often reveals more information about the system in question than the bulk result itself .",
    "the most beautiful example of this occurs in systems with conformal invariance @xcite , where the ground state energy of the system per unit length @xmath5 of a system of length @xmath6 follows the relationship @xcite @xmath7 the crucial thing in this relationship is that the coefficient @xmath8 appearing in the @xmath9 finite - size scaling term is the central charge of the system .",
    "this is a measure of the number of gapless degrees of freedom in the bulk system , and can not be simply determined from knowledge of @xmath10 alone .",
    "when one turns to transport through non - equilibrium nano - structures , one finds a similar dichotomy between theory and experiment in the time domain .",
    "this is most apparent in the study of full counting statistics ( fcs ) of charge transfer @xcite .",
    "the fcs is the study of the full probability distribution @xmath0 that @xmath1 electrons have moved from the source lead to the drain lead in the measuring time @xmath2 , typically when driven by a bias voltage @xmath11 .",
    "this is a probability distribution as the exact number measured in any given realization is subject to both quantum and thermal fluctuations . in a typical experimental measurement of the fcs @xcite ,",
    "one counts ( having first found a way to do so which is not a trivial matter , but is not the subject of this manuscript ) the number of electrons that has flown through the nano - structure in a given time , then repeats the experiment many times to get the distribution .",
    "it is clear that in the long - time limit , the average number @xmath12 of electrons moved , and by extension all moments of the distribution @xmath0 , should be proportional to the measuring time @xmath2 , and indeed the theoretical work has mostly concentrated on the long - time limit @xmath13 .",
    "however in the experiments to date @xcite , the source - drain bias voltage @xmath14 is so low that the relevant dimensionless parameter @xmath15 is actually rather small .",
    "in addition , modern numerical techniques to determine the fcs in strongly correlated systems via real - time simulations @xcite are computationally very expensive and as such can only simulate the system for relatively short measurement times .",
    "one may therefore ask the question : can one understand the contributions to the fcs that are sub - leading in measurement time , and do such contributions give us useful information about the system in question ?",
    "early work in this direction @xcite has concentrated on non - interacting systems ; more recently the present authors have presented a conjecture that extends this work to interacting ( and in particular strongly correlated ) systems @xcite , although this result is limited to zero temperature . in these proceedings , we review this conjecture along with its background , and present the latest numerical evidence for the conjecture .",
    "in addition , we discuss more general questions about finite - time corrections to fcs , particularly with reference to the measurement of fractionally charged quasi - particles . to be concrete ,",
    "we discuss all of this with specific reference to the interacting resonant level model .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : fcs - ni ] , we review the background of full counting statistics in non - interacting systems in the scattering matrix ( landauer - bttiker ) approach . in section [ sec : fcs - i ]",
    "we conjecture how this may be extended to interacting systems , giving numerical evidence in support of our conjecture . in section [ sec : fcs - pt ]",
    "we then discuss one of the more fascinating properties of the interacting resonant level model  a non - equilibrium phase transition characterised by a bifurcation in the cumulant generating function corresponding to fractionalisation of the charge - carrying quasi - particles .",
    "in particular , we show that the conjecture about finite - time corrections must break down at this critical bias voltage , and the relevance of this to the measurement of fractional charge .",
    "finally in section [ sec : end ] , we summarise our results and open questons .    throughout the paper , we use units where planck s constant @xmath16 , and the unit of electrical charge @xmath17 unless otherwise specified . note the slightly unusual choice to use units",
    "in which planck s constant ( @xmath18 ) rather than the reduced constant ( @xmath19 ) is one .",
    "using this choice , the fundamental unit of conductance @xmath20 becomes unity in the dimensionless units , which is convenient for the quantum transport phenomena described in these proceedings .",
    "rather than study directly the probability distribution @xmath0 of @xmath1 electrons ( or in other words , a charge of @xmath21 in our dimensionless units ) being moved from the source lead to the drain lead in measuring time @xmath2 , it is often more convenient to take the fourier transform which gives the generating function of the distribution @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is known as the counting field , and it is usual to further take the logarithm of the above expression to obtain the _",
    "cumulant generating function _ ( cgf ) , @xmath24 the derivatives of the cgf give the irreducible moments @xmath25 substituting the definition in eqs .   and into this expression , we see that the first cumulant @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the current flowing through the system , while the second cumulant @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zero - frequency shot noise . in fact to make the above expressions rigorous in quantum mechanics , one must supplement the definition with a prescription for the appropriate time - ordering of the operator @xmath30 as the current operator does nt commute with itself at different times",
    "; we refer to the literature @xcite for a full discussion on this .",
    "the cgf encodes all information about the statistics of charge transfer through the nanostructure , however one of the easiest quantities to obtain from the cgf is the charge on the ( quasi)particles involved in transport . from the basic definition , one sees that if only single charges @xmath31 ( @xmath32 if units are restored ) may be transferred between the leads , then @xmath33 must be a @xmath34 periodic function .",
    "if however one has , for example , a superconductor where only cooper pairs may be transferred with charge @xmath35 , one will see that @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , if one sees a periodicity larger than @xmath34 , then this is an indication that the particles involved in transport are fractionally charged @xcite .",
    "such fractionally charged quasi - particles appear in strongly correlated systems , where the charge may even change with bias voltage @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail in section [ sec : fcs - pt ] .",
    "we add here one final comment about the periodicity of the cgf . as @xmath33 is given by a complex logarithm , , the imaginary part of @xmath37 is only defined modulo @xmath34 .",
    "the imaginary part of the cgf can therefore contain a linear component @xmath38 and still be classed as periodic .",
    "as we will see later , such a linear component is associated with perfect transmission through the system , and thus is often seen in model systems as it has a particular physical significance .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the average charge transferred between the leads in time @xmath2 is expected to grow linearly in measuring time @xmath2 , and by extension one expects all cumulants to exhibit similar behavior .",
    "hence the cumulant generating function is expected in the long time limit @xmath39 .",
    "it has been shown that the subleading corrections to this at zero temperature @xmath40 are logarithmic @xcite in nature , and hence one may write @xmath3 as a formal expansion in the small parameter @xmath41 : @xmath42 for plotting and comparison to numerical work it is more convenient to take the time derivative of this , @xmath43 from hereon when we refer to the cgf , we will most typically mean @xmath44 , however this should always be clear from context .    for non - interacting system , it is most convenient to use the scattering ( landauer - bttiker ) formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) which describes transport properties in terms of the transmission @xmath45 through the system . within this approach ,",
    "the leading term in the expansion of the cgf was derived by levitov and lesovik @xcite and is given by @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{eq : ll}\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the source and drain voltages respectively , the applied bias @xmath49 . in order to understand this expression",
    "we note that if the transmission is independent of energy @xmath50 , then this gives @xmath51 $ ] , which is just the cgf for the bernoulli distribution where each event occurs with probability @xmath52 .",
    "a full introduction to this may be found in ref .  .",
    "we now turn our attention to the subleading correction , which has been found @xcite to be given by @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{eq : ni - f1}\\ ] ] while we refer to the original papers for the technical details of the derivation of this expression , it is worth making some comments on the origin of these contributions to the cgf that are logarithmic in measuring time .",
    "the cgf may be represented as the determinant of a matrix @xcite which has a toeplitz form .",
    "the leading contribution to this determinant is then given by szego s theorem @xcite ; this is the levitov - lesovik result .",
    "however it is known that if the matrix elements have certain singularities then the determinant acquires logarithmic corrections according to the fisher - hartwig conjecture @xcite . in this case , the singularities come from the fermi edges which are infinitely sharp at zero temperature , the correction being eq .   which was first derived in ref .  .",
    "the crucial point above is that the logarithmic corrections are due the sharp fermi edges .",
    "the first implication of this is that at non - zero temperature when the fermi edges are smooth , the long time expansion _ does not _ contain the ( non - analytic ) logarithmic term . at low temperatures @xmath52 however , there is a crossover time @xmath54 ; at measurement times @xmath55 the cgf will include the logarithmic terms as if the system were at @xmath40 , crossing over at long times @xmath56 to a different temperature - dependent result @xcite .",
    "the second implication is that the coefficient of the logarithmic term , , depends on the system _ only _ in the vicinity of the fermi edges .",
    "this is clearly true in eq .   where the expression depends on the transmission only at the fermi energies of the left and right leads ( which are different due to the bias voltage ) .",
    "we emphasize this point as it will turn out to be very important when we generalize these results to interacting systems in section [ sec : fcs - i ] . before we do this however",
    ", we look at an example of the evolution of the cgf as a function of measuring time in a non - interacting system .      , then the system is the non - interacting resonant level model . ]    the resonant level model ( rlm ) is a fermionic model of a single ( spinless ) state hybridized with two leads , which for convenience are modelled as tight - binding chains .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , which is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : irlm_lattice ] is given by @xmath57 in this expression , @xmath58 is the fermionic creation operator on lead @xmath59 ( the left and right leads correspond to the source and drain in the transport set up ) and site @xmath1 , while @xmath60 is the creation operator on the resonant level .",
    "the hopping parameter of the leads is taken to be @xmath61 ( this is conventionally notated as @xmath62 in condensed matter , however we find @xmath61 more convenient in non - equilibrium situations when @xmath62 is the time ) , and the length of each lead is @xmath63 .",
    "while this is typically taken to be infinite in analytic calculations , numerical simulations are done with finite @xmath63 , see appendix [ sec : size ] .",
    "finally , the hybridization between the resonant level and the leads is given by @xmath64 .",
    "as this is a non - interacting problem , the transport through the resonant level when a bias voltage is applied between the two leads may be calculated in the scattering matrix formalism .",
    "the transmission @xmath45 through the dot as a function of energy @xmath65 in the rlm , is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this equation is for the specific model which has tight - binding leads with a cosine band .",
    "one often takes the limit of a wide band , corresponding to @xmath69 which gives the more usual lorentzian shape of the transmission @xmath70 where @xmath71 . for comparison with high - precision numerics",
    "however , it is necessary to keep the full structure of .",

    "this will allow us to see how well the series , which only contains two terms , compares to real numerical data , and furthermore allows us to see what features the time dependence may exhibit beyond this series .",
    "the advantage of doing this for a non - interacting system is that one may obtain numerical data to relatively long times , which is not possible for strongly correlated interacting systems .",
    "this will be a useful benchmark from which to interpret interacting results presented later in these proceedings .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm - time - evolution ] , we plot the real and imaginary parts of the cgf @xmath74 as a function of inverse measuring time @xmath75 for various values of the counting field @xmath23 and fixed values of the bias voltage @xmath76 and model parameters @xmath77 .",
    "the hopping parameter on the leads @xmath61 gives an overall energy scale to the problem and is fixed to be @xmath78 .",
    "the data points are obtained from numerical simulation , while the solid lines are from the series .",
    "we note that in the series , rather than using bare measuring time @xmath2 , we have replaced this by the conformal time @xmath79 , eq .  , where @xmath80 is the system size .",
    "the conformal time , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite takes into account the leading finite _ size _ effects , and is briefly discussed in appendix [ sec : size ] .",
    "we also note that the imaginary part of @xmath81 tends to be positive , while the real part tends to be negative ; the reasons for this can be seen by looking at the leading terms of the cumulant expansion eq .  .",
    "in order to make the plots as clear as possible , we therefore plot both the real and imaginary parts as positive in most of the graphs , meaning that we plot @xmath82 rather than @xmath83 .",
    "the plotting convention is always clearly stated on the axes of each graph .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm - time - evolution ] , one can make several observations .",
    "the first observation is that the agreement between the numerical data and the series is excellent over a number of orders of magnitude .",
    "it is clear from the plots that the long time asymptotic of @xmath74 is indeed captured by the analytic expressions .",
    "the second observation is that the finite measuring time corrections @xmath84 beyond the infinite measuring time limit @xmath85 are much more important for the real part of this particular model .",
    "in particular , if one is interested in the real part of @xmath81 and has numerical data only up to @xmath86 which is typical time scales reached in numerics on interacting systems , then one must extrapolate over several orders of magnitude to obtain the infinite time value @xmath85 .",
    "we will come back to this point in more detail when we discuss interacting models .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that although the contribution from @xmath84 is not visible on the scale of the plot of the imaginary part in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm - time - evolution ] , this contribution is there and agrees well with the analytic formula ; this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfxi ] .    the third observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm - time - evolution ] is that at smaller times , and in particular for larger values of @xmath23 , there appears to be oscillations on top of the basic series .",
    "we believe that these ( decaying ) oscillations are due to the sudden quench of the system when the counting field is switched on , in other words they depend on details of how the stopwatch for the fcs is started and stopped and are therefore do not depend only on the physics of the system in question ( i.e. they are not universal ) .",
    "we stress however that this is currently a hypothesis ; future work is needed to understand these oscillations .    from the numerical data involved in each of these plots",
    ", one may fit the series to the time evolution in order to numerically determine the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfxi ] and compared to the analytic expressions and to good agreement .",
    "in ref .   we presented a conjecture for the form of the subleading ( in inverse measuring time ) term in the time evolution of the cgf . here , we review this conjecture , and present the latest numerical evidence supporting it .      the scattering formulation which is used in eqs .   and can not be used in interacting systems , as such systems are not fully characterised by a single - particle transmission amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "one can however ask the question : suppose we have managed to calculate the leading term in the cgf , @xmath88 . from this knowledge , can we derive the size of the subleading term @xmath89 ?    by simple comparison of eqs .   and , we see that @xmath90 , \\label{eq : conjecture1}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 .",
    "this formulation makes no reference to the single - particle scattering problem and we _ conjecture _ that this expression remains true when interactions are added to the problem .",
    "we allow in the conjecture that the constant of proportionality @xmath92 may depend on the interaction strength , although the numerical work indicates that at least for the interacting resonant level model in section [ sec : sdirlm ] , the value @xmath91 is unchanged from the non - interacting value .",
    "we stress however that this result can only hold for single channel systems  as soon as there is a sum over different transmission channels , no such simple formula can exist .    for convenience",
    "we limit ourselves to cases which have particle - hole symmetry ; meaning that @xmath93 . in the example of the non - interacting rlm , which satisfies @xmath94",
    ", if one then applies the source and drain biases symmetrically @xmath95 , the conjecture simplifies to become @xmath96    as previously mentioned , in the non - interacting case the logarithmic term in the series arises due to the discontinuity in the fermi function at zero temperature , the above derivative formula indeed relates @xmath84 to the physics at the fermi edges .",
    "perturbatively , one may then certainly imagine an effective landau picture of quasi - particles valid near the fermi - surface .",
    "these would make their contribution to the overall quantities such as current and noise ( in essence @xmath85 ) , although the calculation of these quantities require knowledge of all of the states in the energy window between the two fermi edges so could not be reliably obtained simply from knowledge of the quasi - particles at the fermi surface . on the other hand",
    "the physics around the fermi edge is all that is needed in the determination of @xmath84 , which gives some hope that may remain valid in interacting systems .",
    "we emphasize however that this line of reasoning , though intuitively appealing , has no rigour , and remains a conjecture .",
    "we can however give two pieces of evidence that it remains true .",
    "the first comes from looking at the lowest cumulants , while the second piece of evidence comes from verifying numerically that it holds , at least for one strongly interacting model .",
    "let us expand @xmath88 as @xmath97 where @xmath27 is the current and @xmath29 is the zero - frequency shot noise . according to conjecture",
    ", one then should have the corrections ( expanded to quadratic order in @xmath23 ) as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the conductance of the system .",
    "the consequences of this are twofold .",
    "firstly , we see that there are no ( leading order ) corrections from finite measuring time to the current .",
    "secondly , we see that the corrections to noise due to finite measuring time are @xmath100 the significance of this relates to the frequency dependence of noise , which in non - interacting systems is known to be @xmath101 in @xcite it was shown that this relationship remains true to all orders in perturbation theory when interactions are added , at least in a wide class of models , although the constant of proportionality @xmath92 may depend on interaction strength .",
    "other work @xcite has suggested that the relationship may break down in the nonperturbative regime ; however recent numerical work @xcite has verified that this relation does indeed hold . a full analytic understanding of this is still lacking however .",
    "if one understands that a finite measuring time @xmath2 means that noise can not be probed at zero frequency , and instead is measured at a characteristic frequency @xmath75 , one sees that relations and the conclusion from our conjecture become equivalent .",
    "this means that our conjecture is intimately related to the validity of the expression in the presence of interactions .",
    "while an analytic proof of this is still an open question , the existing literature is in support of this .",
    "we also note that a similar relation between the measuring time dependence and the frequency dependence of the third cumulant has been previously discussed in non - interacting systems @xcite .",
    "however there is very little work on the frequency dependence of the third cumulant in the presence of interactions ; this also remains an interesting direction for future study .",
    "having discussed the conjecture in the context of the low cumulants , we now turn to the full cgf and show that holds for one interacting model .",
    "the interacting resonant level model is the same as the resonant level model , with the addition of an interaction @xmath102 between the resonant level and the leads .",
    "the model is schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : irlm_lattice ] and the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath103 the quartic fermionic term here is the interaction , while the subtractions of @xmath104 is convenient to retain particle hole symmetry .",
    "it turns out that for a certain value @xmath105 , this model has a certain self - duality @xcite that allows the model to be solved exactly via bethe ansatz , even out of equilibrium @xcite    the analytic expression for the cgf of the self - dual interacting resonant level model , as derived from thermodynamic bethe ansatz , is given by @xcite :    @xmath106    here @xmath107 @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the radius of convergence of each series .",
    "we note that unlike the non - interacting model , the interacting one can not be solved exactly on the lattice , and the given result is only for the wide - band ( field - theoretic ) limit .",
    "the non - universal pre - factor @xmath110 relates the regularization of the field theory to the lattice model , and is taken from earlier work @xcite which studied the non - linear @xmath111 characteristics .",

    "the fact the ` impurity ' level is tuned to resonance makes it unsurprising that the transport ( at low bias voltages ) may be considered as a weak correction to perfect transmission .",

    "the constants are nt all positive , due to quantum interference between the different processes .",
    "the important point however is that the backscattered charges are all multiples of @xmath124 , or in other words the quasi - particles that may be backscattered have charge @xmath125 if units are resurrected .    in the opposite limit @xmath126 ,",
    "one notices that the periodicity of @xmath85 is different  this time the sum may be interpreted as a sum of poissonian processes carrying charges @xmath127 from left to right ; or in other words the charge on the quasi - particles that may be transmitted in this limit is @xmath128 ( restoring units ) .",
    "this fractionalisation , by which the fundamental charge changes from @xmath124 at low bias to @xmath104 at high bias was first observed by studying the fano factor of the shot noise @xcite . the shot noise however gave no indication of how this fractionalisation occurs . from studying the fcs however",

    "fortunately , one may recognise that the series for high and low voltages are actually hypergeometric and both give different series representations of the same ( generalised ) hypergeometric function . while one may do this for @xmath85 itself , it is far more convenient to take a derivative and study the counting current @xmath133 .",
    "carrying out the summation gives @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 .    while this representation as a rather exotic hypergeometric function , @xmath136 , is not useful in terms of numerical evaluation , the analytic properties of hypergeometric functions are well documented ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "if @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath113 , the function crosses the branch cuts at @xmath146 . by choosing @xmath143 to be continuous as a function of @xmath23 , this implies that @xmath143 must now be @xmath147 periodic , which in turn implies a fundamental charge of @xmath104 .",
    "we now see that the fractionalisation of charge happens discontinuously at @xmath148 ; the branch point leading to a bifurcation in the cgf .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurcation ] , where the cgf @xmath88 is plotted for @xmath11 slightly above and slightly below @xmath130 .",
    "it is worth pointing out however that while this branch cut leads to a discontinuity in the cgf as a function of @xmath11 , this discontinuity occurs at @xmath149 .",
    "all of the cumulants , which are given as derivates around @xmath150 , are smooth analytic functions of @xmath11 at @xmath148 . in other words",

    "it is clear that the conjecture relies on @xmath85 being a smooth function of @xmath11 ; near the critical bias voltage @xmath130 , this is no longer the case .",
    "this means that in the vicinity of @xmath130 , the conjecture can not hold , or at the very minimum there must be a lot of physics involved in the measuring time dependence of @xmath81 that is not captured by the simple series and the conjecture . in order to study this numerically ,",

    "the imaginary part of @xmath81 fits very well to the conjecture , although with certain oscillations on top of the straight line .",
    "we believe these oscillations to be of the same origin as already seen in the non - interacting case , i.e. related to quenching on the counting field , however this still requires further investigation .",
    "the real part of @xmath81 also appears to converge to the line given by the conjecture after some initial transients .",
    "there seems to be some evidence that the closer @xmath11 is to @xmath130 , the longer one has to wait before convergence ",
    "however this also requires further investigation .",

    ", one sees a continuation of the previous trend ",
    "@xmath158 fits well to the conjecture though with additional oscillations ; while @xmath159 looks like it will converge to the line of the conjecture , although in this case there is not enough data to say this for certain .",
    "the plot for @xmath160 , just greater than @xmath130 is however very revealing . by comparison with the previous plot",
    ", we see that the analytic results have jumped , due to the discontinuity at @xmath130 .",
    "however , the numerical results are very close to the previous panel for @xmath114 ; in other words the evolution of the numerical ( finite - time ) results appears to be smooth as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "this gives strong evidence to support the idea that there is no discontinuity for any finite time  as suggested in question one above .",
    "assuming that the infinite - time limit results are correct , we expect that the time evolution will eventually cross over to the analytic values according to the conjecture ; the numerics suggest that this crossover will happen at a time scale @xmath161 this statement is further supported by the final two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : timeslices ] which shows the time evolution at slightly larger times . here , we see that the short(er ) time behaviour ( which is similar to an analytic continuation of the cgf below at @xmath114 ) eventually evolves to reach strong peaks in @xmath81 in both the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the location of these peaks has already from fig .",

    "[ fig : timeslices ] , it does so according to the conjecture presented in this work .",
    "for @xmath113 however , the finite time results develop additional structure in the form of peaks that become narrower as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "one can certainly imagine how these peaks tend to the discontinuous analytic result as @xmath4 ; however more data is necessary to investigate this further .",
    "finally , let us comment briefly on the role of finite - time on the measurement of fractionally charged quasiparticles .",
    "the background of this problem is that if one does a projective measurement of the number of electrons in the lead , one must obtain one of the eigenvalues of the number operator , i.e. an integer .",
    "the measurement of fractional charge is therefore intimately related to the quantum mechanical measurement problem .",
    "we will not review this in any detail here , but would like to add an extra ingredient to the discussion : the role of finite measuring time . in section [ sec : bif ]",
    ", we showed that , at least for the interacting rlm , the fractionalisation of charge occurs mathematically via a bifurcation at a branch point of the cgf .",
    "we also demonstrated that at finite times , the cgf appears to be a smooth function . at present , our data does not allow us to hypothesize on the periodicity of @xmath81 as a function of measuring time ",
    "however we believe this is an interesting question that could shed some light on the experimental detection of fractional charge .",
    "to summarise , we have discussed the cumulant generating function @xmath3 of full counting statistics , and in particular the evolution of this function with measuring time .",
    "we demonstrated that the leading corrections to the long time limit @xmath162 are logarithmic in nature at zero temperature , and have conjectured that the coefficient of this subleading term is universally related to the long time limit via eq .  .",
    "while we have presented strong numerical evidence for this conjecture for one specific model , its more general validity is an open question .",
    "one promising direction in this regard is based on a keldysh expansion of the cgf @xcite .",
    "another open question which is of great importance for extrapolating numerical results to longer times is about the nature of other finite - time corrections to the cgf , such as the oscillations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlm - time - evolution ] .",
    "while we do nt expect these to be universal , it is important to understand their form and origin in order to fit numerical data to obtain reliable results about the long - time limit of strongly correlated models .",
    "our numerical test of the conjecture were on the self - dual interacting resonant level model , , where we further demonstrated that the long - time limit of the cgf , @xmath85 , has branch cuts associated with fractionalize of charge at some critical voltage @xmath130 .",
    "we demonstrated that the cgf at finite times however shows no discontinuities ; but does show distinctive features in the time evolution associated with this critical point ; occurring at times satisfying eq .  .",
    "we furthermore suggested that this may have strong implications in the attempted experimental measurement of fractional charge .",
    "understanding the physics at this non - equilibrium critical point is an open question , and we believe one of the most fascinating future directions in the theoretical study of non - equilibrium systems .",
    "we thank a.  komnik , d.  bagrets and d.  gutman for insightful discussions .",
    "hs work was supported by the french agence nationale pour la recherche ( anr projet 2010 blanc simi 4 : dime ) and the us department of energy ( grant number de - fg03 - 01er45908 ) .",
    "to study transport properties in the real time numerical method @xcite , one initially finds the ground state of the system subject to a non - uniform potential of @xmath163 on the left ( right ) lead .",
    "this charge imbalance potential is then quenched off at time @xmath164 , and the system is evolved numerically according to the schrdinger equation @xmath165 by calculating the time evolution of the state , one can then evaluate the desired operator .",
    "in particular , the protocol by which one can obtain the cgf of fcs by this method was presented in ref .  .    for interacting systems",
    ", we numerically evolve the system using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , while for the noninteracting systems , we use a much more efficient method based on single - particle evolution and slater determinants @xcite .",
    "however these particular numerical methods of time evolution have one thing in common : they all work on systems of a finite size , @xmath80 .",
    "this means that the leads are not considered infinite and instead consist of @xmath166 lattice sites .",
    "there are a number of consequences of evolution on a system of finite size @xcite , the most crucial being that there is a transit time @xmath167",
    "( @xmath168 being the fermi velocity in the leads ) after which the charge imbalance has flowed across the system , bounces of the boundary and starts coming back thus destroying the steady - state current flow .",
    "this therefore provides a hard limit on how long the system may be evolved for ; the numerical equivalent of the battery going flat . the typical sizes ( and therefore maximum times ) that may be simulated on a computer",
    "are limited by computer resources , although clearly the single - particle basis for the non - interacting case means that much larger systems may be used there .    while we refer to previous work @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the manifestations of finite - size in non - equilibrium transport , we mention here one extremely useful result that is used in these proceedings .",
    "in a ( conformally invariant ) system of finite size , one can capture the leading effects of times close to the transit time when the current is beginning to reverse direction by replacing the measuring time with a _",
    "_ @xcite . in the simulations ,",
    "the counting begins at a time @xmath169 , which is chosen to be sufficiently long after the initial quench at @xmath164 so that the largest transients have died away and the system is in a ( quasi-)steady state .",
    "the conformal substitution therefore amounts to replacing the measuring time @xmath170 by the conformal time @xmath171 for short times @xmath172 , we find @xmath173 .",
    "the difference only becomes important at times near the transit time .",
    "equation is based on the usual conformal transformation between the plane and a cylinder of finite extent in imaginary time @xcite , and analytically continuing to real time .",
    "we note that while this procedure is not entirely justified in this setup @xcite , a comparison to numerics shows that it captures the leading effect of the back - reflection off the edges of the system remarkably well @xcite .",
    "while there is a lot of work on the fcs of other interacting models out of equilibrium ( see e.g. @xcite ) , there are no exact results available for the cgf .",
    "in particular , there is a lot of work on the interacting rlm , for more general values of @xmath102 @xcite , however without exact results for comparison to numerics , it is not easy to check the validity of the conjecture [ eq : conjecture2 ] .",
