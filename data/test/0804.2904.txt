    "the study of the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can provide crucial information on the origin of the universe and help us to discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "recent observations in many cosmological fields tend to support the standard inflationary model , which predicts the anisotropies to represent an isotropic gaussian random field . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 1-year data ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) , measured the cmb fluctuations with high accuracy . in a first approach ( komatsu et al .",
    "2003 ) , these were found to be consistent with the gaussian predictions .",
    "further analyses revealed asymmetries or non - gaussian features which have been confirmed in the 3-year wmap data ( hinshaw et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some of these anomalies are : low multipole alignments ( de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "2006 , copi et al .",
    "2007 , land & magueijo 2007 , chiang et al . 2007 ) , north - south asymmetries ( eriksen et al . 2007 ) , structure alignment ( vielva et al . 2007 ) , non - gaussian features found with steerable ( wiaux et al . 2008 ) and directional wavelets ( mcewen et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a very cold spot in the southern hemisphere ( cruz et al .",
    "this cold spot ( cs ) is found at galactic coordinates ( @xmath1 ) , and has an angular radius in the sky of @xmath2 .",
    "the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) was used to detect this structure .",
    "this spherical wavelet is an optimal tool to enhance non - gaussian features on the sphere .",
    "the first smhw analysis ( vielva et al . 2004 ) was performed on 15 different wavelet scales and two estimators , skewness and kurtosis , were used .",
    "the kurtosis deviated significantly from the range of values expected from gaussian simulations at scales around @xmath3 .",
    "the spot was found to be the main cause of the deviation from gaussianity , using the area estimator ( cruz et al .",
    "cruz et al . ( 2006 ) showed the incompatibility of the frequency independent signal of the cs with galactic foregrounds , and cayn , jin & treaster ( 2005 ) introduced two new estimators , namely @xmath4 and higher criticism , redetecting the cs .",
    "cruz et al .",
    "( 2007a ) confirmed the detection in the 3-year wmap data , using all the mentioned estimators . in the latter paper ,",
    "the probability of finding an at least as high deviation in gaussian simulations was calculated without any _ a posteriori _ assumption .",
    "a conservative estimate of this probability was 1.85% , and hence this spot is a very special feature whose origin deserves further investigation .",
    "rth et al.(2007 ) detect the cs in the 3-year wmap data using scalar indices instead of wavelets .",
    "several models were proposed in order to explain this anomaly : voids ( inoue & silk 2006 , 2007 , rudnick , brown & williams 2007 ) , second order gravitational effects ( tomita 2005 , tomita & inoue 2007 ) , anisotropic bianchi vii@xmath5 model ( jaffe et al . 2005 ) , finite cosmology model , ( adler , bjorken & overduin 2006 ) , asymptotically flat lemaitre - tolman - bondi model ( garcia - bellido & haugbolle 2008 ) and brane - world model ( cembranos et al . 2008 ) are some of them .",
    "also a large - scale , non - gaussian angular modulation ( naselsky et al . 2007 ) has been suggested although this hypothesis is not based on any physical model .",
    "the bianchi vii@xmath5 model was proven by jaffe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to be ruled out at high significance , whereas there is still no further evidence for the validity of the other explanations .",
    "a full bayesian evidence analysis of that bianchi model can be found in bridges et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "bridges et al .",
    "( 2007b ) show that the cold spot was likely to be driving any bianchi vii@xmath5 template detection .",
    "recently , cruz et al . ( 2007b ) showed that the cs could be caused by a cosmic texture .",
    "the amplitude and scale of the spot were consistent with that interpretation and the kurtosis of the data was compatible with the gaussian cmb plus texture model at all scales .",
    "the predicted number of spots at a scale of @xmath3 or larger , is @xmath6 which is consistent with the observed spot .    in this paper",
    "we study two other possibilities , namely the rees - sciama ( rees & sciama 1968 ) effect caused by voids as proposed by inoue & silk ( 2006 , 2007 ) , rudnick , brown & williams ( 2007 ) and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by clusters ( hereafter sz effect , sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) already considered in cruz et al .",
    "both of them could in principle produce temperature decrements as the cs . in addition",
    "a dip ( rudnick , brown & williams 2007 ) in the nrao vla sky survey data ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and the eridanus group of galaxies ( brough et al . 2006 ) match approximately the size and position in the sky of the cs",
    ". however , the values required by the parameters of either model are not very realistic .",
    "a bayesian framework is very convenient to decide which model best describes the data .",
    "the prior theoretical and observational knowledge on the parameters is included in the bayesian analysis and can be decisive in some cases .",
    "our analysis is performed on the recently released 5-year wmap data ( hinshaw et al .",
    "the large - scale structure of the cmb anisotropies remains almost unchanged respect to the 3-year release ( komatsu et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we will first review the data and the template fitting method in section 2 , then we recall in section 3 the results obtained for the texture model in order to compare with the sz effect in section 4 and the void model in section 5 .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we use the combined , foreground - cleaned q - v - w map ( hereafter wcm ) of the 5-year wmap data release ( hinshaw et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the wcm is in the healpix pixelization scheme ( gorski et al .",
    "2005 ) with resolution parameter nside = 64 .",
    "since the scale of the spot is around @xmath3 this resolution is sufficient and reduces the number of pixels used in the template fitting .",
    "the template fitting is performed in a circular area of @xmath7 radius centered at galactic coordinates ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "although the angular radius of the cs is about @xmath3 we have to consider at least a @xmath7 radius patch to take into account the whole neighborhood of the spot for the fit .",
    "the smhw convolves all the pixels in this region and they contribute in an important way to the detected structure .    in our template fitting we apply bayesian statistics to the data , @xmath8 , in order to find the best hypothesis , @xmath9 , describing the data through a set of parameters , @xmath10 .",
    "bayes theorem states : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the posterior distribution , @xmath13 the likelihood , @xmath14 the prior and @xmath15 the bayesian evidence .",
    "the null hypothesis , @xmath16 , describes the data as an isotropic gaussian random field ( cmb ) plus the noise of the wmap data . the alternative hypothesis",
    ", @xmath17 describes the data as cmb plus noise and an additional template , @xmath18 , given by a physical model as for instance a texture spot , the sz effect produced by a cluster or the rees - sciama effect generated by a local void . @xmath19",
    "( with @xmath20 ) depends on the parameter set @xmath21 .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "the probability density associated with the observed data is @xmath22 the evidence is hence the average of the likelihood with respect to the prior and has been extensively used for model selection in cosmology ( e.g. jaffe 1996 , hobson , bridle & lahav 2002 , hobson & mclachlan 2003 , mukherjee , parkinson & liddle 2005 , parkinson , mukherjee & liddle 2006 ) . a model having a large evidence shows a high likelihood for its allowed parameter space given the data .",
    "we redefine our notation , with the likelihood @xmath23 , and the prior @xmath24 so the previous integral for the evidence , @xmath25 , reads : @xmath26    the likelihood function is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is defined as : @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the generalised noise matrix including cmb and noise .",
    "the template @xmath18 depends on the parameter set @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation of the noise contribution to @xmath30 is straightforward since the noise in the wcm is uncorrelated and well known . in order to obtain the cmb part",
    ", we calculate the correlation function for the wcm taking into account the pixel and beam effects . comparing the resulting evidence ratios obtained from the analytical expression for the wcm correlation function with those obtained",
    "using simulations , the errors are negligible .    the posterior probability ratio : @xmath31 can be used to decide beween both hypotheses .",
    "the alternative hypothesis is the more probable one when @xmath32 . if @xmath33 the null hypothesis is the preferred one to describe the data .",
    "the a priori probability ratio for the two models , @xmath34 is set to the fraction of the sky , @xmath35 , covered by either texture , clusters or voids . in this manner",
    "we compensate the _ a posteriori _ selection of the pixel where the template is centred , namely the center of the cs , ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "unified theories of high energy physics predict the production of topological defects ( kibble 1976 , vilenkin & shellard 2000 ) during a symmetry - breaking phase transition in the early universe . depending on the order of the broken symmetry ,",
    "different types of defects arise , such as domain walls , strings , monopoles or texture .",
    "each of these extremely energetic events leave a characteristic pattern in the cmb .",
    "for instance cosmic texture ( turok 1989 ) produce hot and cold spots in the cmb sky .",
    "cruz et al . ( 2007b ) showed recently that the cs could be due to a collapsing texture .",
    "a bayesian template fit was performed on the 3-year wmap data , using an approximated temperature profile based on the analytic result given in turok & spergel ( 1990 ) .",
    "the a priori probability ratio for the two models , @xmath34 , was estimated in this case by the fraction of sky covered by texture , @xmath36 .",
    "the evidence ratio was @xmath37 , hence the resulting posterior probability ratio was @xmath38 favoring the texture hypothesis versus the null hypothesis .",
    "the scale and amplitude of the spot ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) were consistent with having being caused by a texture at redshift @xmath41 and energy scale @xmath42 .",
    "the number of texture spots of scale @xmath39 or above is around @xmath43 consistent with the single observed spot .",
    "the amplitude of the texture spot was shown to be overestimated by a selection bias .",
    "texture spots with amplitude @xmath44 were simulated and added to cmb gaussian simulations . performing a template fit on these single extreme events ,",
    "the inferred amplitude was in average @xmath45 , i.e. almost twice the true amplitude .",
    "this means that the amplitude required by the cs is not in conflict with the upper limits on the amplitude calculated from the power spectrum ( urrestilla et al . 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , bevis et al . ( 2008 ) and urrestilla et al . ( 2007 ) find a @xmath46 preference for a cosmological model including texture or strings , when considering only cmb data .",
    "however this preference is reduced when including hubble key project ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) and big bang nuclesosynthesis ( kirkman et al . 2003 ) constraints in the bayesian power spectrum anlysis .    in order to estimate the significance of the @xmath38 result",
    ", the same fitting procedure was performed on 10,000 gaussian cmb simulations .",
    "the most prominent spot was selected for each simulation and a texture profile was fitted to it . around @xmath47 of the simulations showed @xmath48 and the typical values where @xmath49 .",
    "this result was found to be almost independent on the priors or the exact shape of the approximated temperature profile .    using the 5-year data release we obtain @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the lower noise level allows a slightly better detection of the texture template in the new data release .",
    "we have not repeated the frequentist estimation of the significance because the result was very similar to the 3-year one .",
    "the probability of having an at least as extreme value ( i.e. @xmath52-value ) of @xmath53 assuming that the null hypothesis is true , should be again around @xmath54 .",
    "the presence of texture would explain the excess of kurtosis observed at scales around @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath55 texture predicted by the model would be confused with gaussian cmb spots since the latter have their maximum power at these scales .",
    "a number of follow - up tests can be performed to check the texture hypothesis .",
    "for instance an all - sky template fitting looking for several texture can confirm or refute the alternative hypothesis .",
    "also a polarization analysis can help to decide , since gaussian cmb spots have a correlated polarization pattern , whereas late texture do not show associated polarization .",
    "in addition the b - mode texture power spectrum is expected to be larger than the typical inflationary one , having also a different shape ( urrestilla et al .",
    "the hot gas trapped in clusters modifies the cmb spectrum through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "the high - energetic electrons present in the gas collide with the cmb photons , changing their original frequency .",
    "two different components can be identified .",
    "the former is produced by random thermal motion of the electrons ( thermal effect ) , and the second one , by the peculiar motion of the cluster with respect to the cmb ( kinetic effect ) .",
    "the thermal sz effect is typically one order of magnitude higher than the kinetic one , and therefore we focus on the first one .",
    "the effect on the cmb photons is frequency dependent and at frequencies below 217 ghz it produces a temperature decrement .",
    "hence this effect is a possible candidate to explain an anomalously cold spot at the wmap frequencies which range from 23 ghz to 94 ghz .",
    "the temperature decrement is given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the frequency in dimensionless units , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 planck and boltzmann constants respectively , and @xmath60 .",
    "the cluster comptonization parameter is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the intracluster electron density and temperature , @xmath64 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath65 is the electron mass .",
    "the integral is performed along the line of sight through the cluster . in hot clusters ( @xmath66 kev ) , the relativistic electrons lead to a slightly modified spectral behaviour of the thermal sz effect , but this is negligible in our analysis . also neglected is the kinetic sz effect of the cluster .",
    "cruz et al . (",
    "2006 ) showed that the flat frequency dependence of the cs is incompatible with being caused by a sz signal alone .",
    "however a combination of cmb plus sz effect may explain the spot and could have a sufficiently flat frequency spectrum .",
    "cruz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) already reported that a group of local galaxies were present in the direction of the cs .",
    "they argued that the amount of gas needed to explain the whole signal was too large for a small group of galaxies .",
    "however the group of galaxies in the direction of the spot has been shown recently to be larger than previously thought .",
    "brough et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , define it as the eridanus _ supergroup _ with mass @xmath67 .",
    "the angular size and position in the sky of eridanus are similar to those of the cs , as can be seen in figure  ( [ fig : patch ] ) .",
    "the top panel shows the wcm data and the bottom one , the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully , 1987 )",

    "we consider two alternative hypotheses in this context . in the first one",
    "the spot would be caused by a rich cluster and in the second one by a nearby group of the nearby galaxies catalog .",
    "we simulate the entire population of clusters with flux above 10 mjy ( at 353 ghz ) , using a monte carlo algorithm where masses and redshifts were assigned to each cluster according to the press - schechter prescription ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the matter and vacuum energy density parameters , and @xmath92 the dispersion of the density field at scales of 8 mpc ) .",
    "the cut in flux removes nearby small groups of galaxies and distant small clusters .",
    "the redshifts of the simulated clusters range from 0.005 to 3.4 . for each cluster with",
    "known mass and redshift the core radius is determined from the scaling relation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the mass of the cluster in @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "it is important to note that the cut in flux does not have any negative effect in the results of this paper since the fluxes we are trying to explain are much larger than 10 mjy .",
    "since the redshift and core radius are known for each cluster , we calculate the angle subtended by the core , @xmath80 .",
    "we find the maximum angle of the 300,000 clusters to be @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the cluster hypothesis has to be discarded for generating a @xmath3 spot .",
    "returning to the particular case of the eridanus supergroup found in the nearby galaxies catalog , we can consider larger values of @xmath80 , due to its proximity and lower values of @xmath84 since it is not a cluster but a big group or an ensemble of groups .",
    "in addition we assume lower values of @xmath52 because the gas could be rather dispersed since the gravitational attraction is lower than in big clusters . now",
    "the alternative hypothesis is that a big group from the nearby galaxies catalog is causing the cs .",
    "although the center of eridanus does not match exactly the center of the spot , we still center the template at ( @xmath1 ) , since the gas does not need to fit exactly the positions of the galaxies .",
    "this assumption is the most favorable for the alternative hypothesis . if the cs was due to the sz effect we would expect high x - ray emission in the considered region .",
    "we can use the rosat all - sky survey ( snowden et al . 1997 ) to estimate the prior on @xmath84 .",
    "the rosat survey excludes some small regions of the sky , and one of them crosses the considered patch .",
    "however the estimated average counts in the rosat r6 band are around @xmath98 cts s@xmath99 arcmin@xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath70-models which are compatible with this background and at the same time show an extended sz signal of several degrees , range between models with a core radius of @xmath101 mpc and bolometric luminosities of @xmath102 erg / s and models with @xmath103 mpc and bolometric luminosities of @xmath104 erg / s .",
    "these models would predict at most @xmath105 .",
    "the nearest groups in the nearby galaxies catalog are at @xmath106 mpc distance and as we have shown , the upper limit for the core radius is @xmath103 mpc . in this case",
    "we get @xmath107 rad , which we set as the upper limit for @xmath80 .",
    "we set the lower limit on @xmath80 to @xmath108 , since the spot has @xmath3 radius and the pixel size is around @xmath108 for the chosen resolution .",

    "the best fit parameters are the upper limits of the priors , @xmath115 and @xmath107 rad .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature decrement does not exceed @xmath116 and is hence negligible compared to the deep decrement .",
    "therefore the @xmath112 result is not suggesting that the sz hypothesis is viable for explaining the spot .",
    "as the template has a negligible effect on the data , @xmath117 , the likelihood is almost constant in the whole parameter range and as the priors integrate to unity we have @xmath118 .",
    "this is a well - known feature of bayesian model selection . in any problem , if @xmath17 has additional parameters compared to @xmath16 , and the likelihood is insensitive to these parameters , then @xmath119 .",
    "the results do not significantly depend on the value of @xmath52 , the chosen priors or the resolution .",
    "the gravitational effect due to a supercluster can not strongly affect large angular fluctuations because these massive structures are very concentrated in a particular region .",
    "on the contrary , voids are better candidates to generate large angular spots .",
    "the gravitational effect produced by cosmic voids can produce temperature decrements in the cmb and has been proposed as a possible source of the cs ( inoue & silk 2006 , 2007 ) . in analogy to the cluster case with the eridanus supergroup , there is a dip in the nvss radio source catalogue that approximately matches the position of the spot .",
    "rudnick , brown & williams ( 2007 ) , claim that the dip could be associated with a void at redshift @xmath120 which could be the origin of the cs , but affirm that the significance of this coincidence is unclear .",
    "as the fraction of the universe filled by voids is around @xmath121 in volume at redshift @xmath122 ( colberg et al . 2005 ) , the fraction of the sky covered in projection , @xmath35 , is close to one and hence such coincidences are not rare .",
    "the dip and the cs appear at different scales as can be seen in figure [ fig : wmap_nvss ] where we present a @xmath68 patch of the wmap and nvss data convolved with the smhw at scales @xmath3 and @xmath123 . at scale @xmath3 the cs reaches its maximum power in the wcm , whereas there is no significant dip visible in the nvss data . at scale @xmath123 where the cs is not an outstanding feature , a dip becomes visible but there are other similar dips with no associated cmb spots , therefore the association between dip and spot is unclear and could be a coincidence .",
    "moreover , there are several other dips with similar depth outside the selected region hence the dip does not seem to be an outstanding feature of the nvss data .",
    "mcewen et al . ( 2007 ) found several regions where both data sets were highly correlated and one of them was located close to the cs .",
    "this could be due to the very cold temperature of the cs which gives a high correlation with any underdense region in the nvss data at scale @xmath3 and not to the relation between dip and spot since they have different scales ( see figure [ fig : wmap_nvss ] ) .",

    "the probability of observing such a void in standard theory is very small .",
    "for instance , a void with @xmath125 mpc will occur with a probability of @xmath126 in an optimistic case ( rudnick , brown & williams 2007 ) .",

    "they adopt the thin shell approximation , where the void is an empty spherical region surrounded by a thin shell containing the matter which would have been inside the void . outside the void the universe is represented by an einstein - de sitter model and the shell propagates approximately as @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "we renormalise the priors in the new parameter ranges and recalculate the prior probability ratio since the big voids ( in case they exist ) are expected to cover only a small part of the sky . as shown above a void with @xmath125 mpc is expected to occur with a probability of @xmath126 ( rudnick , brown & williams 2007 ) . hence as a valid upper limit",
    "we can assume that there is at most one big void with @xmath125mpc and @xmath151 .",
    "the fraction of the sky covered by this void is @xmath152 .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath153 . recalculating the evidence for the new parameter range",
    ", we obtain @xmath154 which yields @xmath155 .",
    "this result discards the possibility of explaining the cs through such a void .",
    "hence the void hypothesis has to be rejected .",
    "inoue & silk ( 2006 , 2007 ) proposed slightly different voids with very high values for the radius of the void , @xmath156 mpc and quasi linear density contrast values @xmath157 , while rudnick , brown & williams ( 2007 ) used @xmath158 .",
    "inoue & silk ( 2007 ) recognize that the required values for @xmath75 are inconsistent with observations at low @xmath82 and n - body simulations .",
    "such a void is a @xmath159 result in the standard theory with @xmath160 .",
    "they consider that a percolation process of the typically observed small voids could form the large quasi linear voids .",
    "however these voids have not been observed yet and as already mentioned , according to n - body simulations ( colberg et al .",
    "2005 ) the void sizes should be smaller at high , unobserved redshifts .",
    "in this paper we consider different possibilities to explain a non - gaussian cold spot found in the wmap data .",
    "this spot is located at galactic coordinates ( @xmath1 ) , covers around @xmath161 in the sky , has been shown to be incompatible with gaussian simulations and is unlikely to be produced by foregrounds ( vielva et al .",
    "2004 , cruz et al .",
    "2005 , cruz et al .",
    "2006 , cruz et al .",
    "we compare three alternative hypotheses to explain the cs , namely texture , clusters and voids versus the null hypothesis .",
    "the latter describes the data as an isotropic gaussian random field ( cmb ) plus the noise of the wmap data .",
    "a bayesian analysis takes into account the prior observational and theoretical knowledge on the parameters and can be used to find the hypothesis best describing the data .",
    "the posterior probability ratio , @xmath53 , is the quantity we use to compare the different hypotheses .",
    "the alternative hypothesis is preferred if @xmath32 and disfavored otherwise .",
    "cruz et al . (",
    "2007b ) performed such an analysis for the texture model , finding that this model is favored versus the hypothesis of gaussian fluctuations with @xmath162 .",
    "the predicted size , amplitude , temperature profile , and number of spots generated by texture is consistent with the observed spot . repeating this analysis for the 5-year wmap data we find @xmath163 due to the lower noise level .",
    "the frequentist @xmath52-value associated to this result is around @xmath54 .",
    "the finding of a local supergroup ( brough et al .",
    "2006 ) and a dip in the nvss survey ( rudnick , brown & williams 2007 ) , which match the position of the cs could be a hint for the cluster or void hypotheses , but our detailed bayesian analysis reveals that these are statistical coincidences .",
    "the fraction of the sky covered by clusters and voids is included in our analysis .",
    "the large angular size and temperature decrement of the cs are hard to explain with conventional clusters or voids .",
    "we would need either a local , rich cluster or a void with radius @xmath164 mpc located at redshift @xmath149 . in the cluster case",
    "only a local group with compton parameter @xmath165 is observed in the required direction .",
    "the angular scale is marginally consistent with the spot but the temperature decrement generated is only a few @xmath166 and hence can not account for the cs .",
    "our bayesian analysis gives @xmath167 , discarding the cluster hypothesis .    for conventional voids with @xmath127",
    "mpc we obtain @xmath142 because the likelihood is insensitive to the extra parameters .",
    "a detailed analysis reveals that these voids produce negligible temperature decrements below @xmath116 .",
    "renormalising the priors for voids with radius @xmath164 mpc , we obtain a posterior probability ratio of @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the void hypothesis is not viable either . explaining the cold spot by a void with @xmath148 mpc ,",
    "would introduce a @xmath159 anomaly in the standard model to solve the @xmath169 anomaly of the spot .",
    "the solution would be worse than the problem .",
    "hence we can conclude that the texture hypothesis is the most plausible explanation for the cs .",
    "many scientists are uncomfortable with cosmic defects , because these failed to explain structure formation . however , cosmic defects are a generic consequence of symmetry breaking , which is an essential ingredient in unified theories of particle physics .",
    "hence it is very plausible that they exist .",
    "they might be formed at any scale below the grand unified scale , and would be consistent with current cosmological observations .",
    "they are even compatible with inflation .",
    "the only constraint is that they should make a subdominant contribution to structure formation ( see for instance urrestilla et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the virtue of the texture hypothesis is that it is fully testable .",
    "a texture would not lead to a correlated polarization pattern around the cold spot , but it would lead to a very specific gravitational lensing pattern .",
    "in addition there should be more cmb texture spots at scales around @xmath170 .",
    "although they are more difficult to detect because the gaussian cmb reaches its maximum power at these scales , we may be able to detect them through an all - sky bayesian analysis , which is already in progress .",
