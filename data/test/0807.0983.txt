    "psr j0205 + 6449 in supernova remnant ( snr ) 3c58 is a recently discovered x - ray and radio pulsar @xcite with a period of 65 ms .",
    "3c 58 was thought to be young due to a possible association with sn 1181 @xcite .",
    "consequently it should share many of the characteristics of the crab nebula , including the presence of a young pulsar .",
    "however an embedded pulsar defied detection for over twenty years .",
    "psr j0205 + 6449 has a considerably weaker flux than the crab pulsar .",
    "its x - ray emission is 1000 times lower than the crab and its radio emission 120 times lower .",
    "some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the mounting evidence that the characteristic age of the pulsar ( @xmath9 @xmath10 5400 years ) is near to its true age and hence it is not associated with sn 1181 @xcite .",
    "vla observations at 1.4ghz show a nebula expansion rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath12 @xcite , inconsistent with sn 1181 unless substantial deceleration of the remnant has occurred .",
    "a comprehensive optical study of 3c 58 showed no evidence of an optical pulsar at m@xmath1322.5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore based upon the relatively low proper motion of knots within 3c 58 these authors also cast doubt on the association between 3c 58 and sn 1181 .",
    "deeper optical observations of 3c 58 show evidence of an optical nebulosity at the same location as the x - ray counterpart to psr j0205 + 6449 @xcite .",
    "these authors interpret this nebulosity as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "psr j0205 + 6449 has the third highest spin down energy flux [ @xmath14 ergs / s / kpc@xmath15 after the crab and vela pulsars . the x - ray determined hydrogen column density [ @xmath16 , @xcite and optical extinction , e(b - v ) @xmath17 0.68 @xcite , are similar to the crab pulsar . from hi observations",
    "a kinematic distance of 3c 58 has been established at 3.2 kpc @xcite , consistent with its dispersion measure @xcite .",
    "these combine to make psr j0205 + 6449 a likely candidate for optical emission studies .",
    "if we assume that the optical luminosity scales with light cylinder magnetic field , @xmath18 @xcite , then we estimate that the pulsar should have a visual magnitude in the range 2325 , depending on interstellar absorption and effects of beaming geometry @xcite . this paper reports on a william herschel telescope ( wht ) service time observation of psr j0205 + 6449 to look for evidence of an optical pulsar and its possible pwn .",
    "photometric observations of the field surrounding 3c  58 were performed on the night of september 10 , 2007 using the 4.2-m wht at the isaac newton group of telescopes , la palma .",
    "the observations were taken in service mode with the auxiliary port imaging camera ( aux ) , using the harris set of the broadband bvr filters .",
    "it is thought that when the filter response curves are convolved with a typical ccd response , these glass filters provide a closer match to the standard johnson @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the kron - cousins @xmath21 bandpass .",
    "aux , with its 1024@xmath221024 tek ccd , has an unvignetted , circular field diameter of 1.8 arcmin with the pixel size on the sky of 0108 @xmath22 0108 .",
    "the integration time was 1000 s in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands each , and 1400 s in the @xmath21 band .",
    "the landolt standard star 94 - 242 was observed immediately after the primary target at a similar airmass .",
    "the weather conditions were very good and stable during the observations .",
    "as a result , the @xmath23 of a stellar object in the images is less than 075 in all the bands .",
    "table [ obstab ] provides a journal of the observations .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques within iraf  and midas .",
    "the frames were debiased and flat fielded using sky flats from the same night .    cccccc date & utc & filter & duration & sec@xmath24 & seeing + & & & ( s ) & & ( @xmath25 ) + 2007-sep-11 & 02:34:27 & b & 1000 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 + 2007-sep-11 & 02:54:27 & v & 1000 & @xmath28 & @xmath27 + 2007-sep-11 & 03:13:50 & r & 1400 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 +    cccc star & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + & mag & mag & mag + 1 & 19.73 & 18.77 & 18.15 + 2 & 20.60 & 19.36 & 18.58 + 3 & 22.25 & 20.79 & 19.86 + 4 & 21.29 & 19.74 & 18.76 + 5 & 21.96 & 20.73 & 19.98 +    the formal , statistical errors are less than 001 for all the stars with the exclusion of the stars 3 and 5 in the @xmath19 band where they have errors of @xmath17002 .",
    "our astrometry was made using positions of ten reference stars from the usno - b1.0 catalogue .",
    "we used the iraf  tasks ccmap / cctran for the astrometric transformation of the images .",
    "formal rms errors of the astrometric fit for the ra and dec were 0066 and 0059 for the r , 0081 and 0035 for the v , and 0079 and 0041 for the b bands respectively , that is better than the pixel size of the images .",
    "first of all , the magnitudes of five relatively bright stars visible in the target frame were derived accurately ( figure  [ compstarsfig ] ) .",
    "this photometric calibration was carried using the landolt standard star 94 - 242 .",
    "our data do not allow us to determine the atmospheric extintion coefficient . instead of this",
    "we use the average coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , provided for the roque de los muchachos observatory , la palma @xcite . the signal - to - noise ratios @xmath33 and the magnitude uncertainties @xmath34 were calculated as @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the source flux in counts for a given aperture , @xmath38 is the gain , @xmath39 the number of pixels in the source aperture , @xmath40 the number of pixels in area used for the background measurement .",
    "and @xmath41 is the standard deviation of the background in counts @xcite .",
    "the stars chosen as secondary standards are marked by numbers in figure  [ compstarsfig ] , and their magnitudes with errors are listed in table  [ compstarstab ] .",
    "the resulting zero - points for the pulsar frames are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the formal , statistical zero - point errors are less than 001 .",
    "however , since only an average curve for atmospheric extinction was used and only one standard star was observed and this only once , the real errors can be as large as few @xmath22 0.01 magnitude .",
    "recent observations of 3c  58 @xcite have shown evidence of an optical nebulosity at the same location as the x - ray counterpart of psr j0205 + 6449 .",
    "they described it as a faint extended , elliptical structure with no resolved point - like object at its centre .",
    "our observations confirm the presence of this nebulosity .",
    "however , its brightest area has a non - elliptical shape with an arc - like filamentary structure .",
    "figure  [ psrfig ] ( left panel ) shows the r band image of this region .",
    "in fact , such a nebula structure is also clearly seen in the v image of 3c  58 presented by @xcite in their figure  3 . for consistency with shibanov et al . , we have performed photometry of this area using the similar elliptical apertures ( table 1 in their paper ) .",
    "the aperture that formally encapsulates @xmath45 86% of the total nebula flux , is shown in figure  [ psrfig ] ( left panel ) as a white ellipse .",
    "the measured integral magnitudes of the nebula are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the measured b and v magnitudes agree within errors with those of @xcite .",
    "although our values are a bit brighter .",
    "the latter can be explained by non - perfect reduction of the standard stars , as well as by the variable background .",
    "we note however that in the r band the nebula is brighter than the upper limit for the pulsar magnitude taken from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the r image shows this nebula with some structure significantly above the noise . in the right panel of figure  [ psrfig ]",
    "we show the same area of the r image , but with different contrast to emphasise different components of the nebula .",
    "there are three compact objects in the middle of this nebula , marked in figure  [ psrfig ] as o1 , o2 and o3 ( the last two could be one arc - like object ) .",
    "we have measured the magnitudes of these objects , using a 5 pixel radius aperture corresponding to a sky radius of approximately 054 .",
    "we used the same background as determined previously for the photometry of the nebula .",
    "the measured magnitudes are @xmath4 ( o1 ) , @xmath5 ( o2 ) and @xmath6 ( o3 ) .",
    "we have also measured the flux from the brightest part of the nebula outside the objects , using the same aperture , and obtained the value @xmath46 , giving us confidence in the reality of the compact objects in the nebula .",
    "unfortunately , the b and v images are too noisy to confirm their existence in these bands although upper limits can be given .",
    "the high contrast b and v and images are shown in figure  [ psrfig2 ] . based upon",
    "@xcite we expect e(v - r ) and e(b - r ) to be @xmath17 0.5 and 1.2 respectively , and this extinction probably accounts for the non - detection in the b and v bands .",
    "the results of our photometry , with the measured coordinates of the compact objects inside of the nebula , are presented in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "in conclusion we note that the object o1 is well inside the typical hrc pointing uncertainty , @xmath47 , marked in figure  [ psrfig ] as a circle around the pulsar position .",
    "we propose that this is the best candidate for the optical counterpart of the pulsar .",

    "from these observations we confirm the presence of an optical pwn around psr j0205 + 6449 and identify possible structure within the nebula .",
    "although from these observations we can not definitively identify the optical counterpart of psr j0205 + 6449 we can give a deep upper limit and make a tentative suggestion that our object o1 is the counterpart . if it is shown that o1 is the counterpart then we can estimate , using @xcite , the flux from the pulsar to be 0.71 @xmath49jy in the range @xmath50 6000 - 7000  , corresponding to a r - band luminosity of @xmath51 ergs sec@xmath12 based upon an e(b - v)=0.68 giving a@xmath52 1.8 .",
    "this luminosity gives an efficiency @xmath53 of @xmath54 and a @xmath8 .",
    "the optical efficiency is about 5% of the crab pulsar s optical efficiency and comparable to the efficiency of older optical pulsars such as vela and psr b0656 + 14 @xcite .",
    "the optical  x - ray luminosity ratio is relatively high at 0.004 , but this is more of a reflection of the low x - ray luminosity . from these tentative observations we can conclude that the optical emission , if confirmed , is consistent with a pulsar with an age similar to its spin down age rather than that of a very young pulsar .",
    "final optical identification will have to wait for observations sensitive to flux variations on millisecond time scales using instruments such as optima @xcite or gasp @xcite .",
