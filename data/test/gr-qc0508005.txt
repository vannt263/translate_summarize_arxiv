    "one of the most interesting issues in general relativity is the subject ofenergy - momentum localization .",
    "this problem of defining in an acceptable manner the energy - momentum density hasnt got a generally accepted answer yet .",
    "the localization of energy implies the use of various energy - momentum complexes , including the prescriptions of einstein @xcite , landau and lifshitz @xcite , papapetrou @xcite , bergmann @xcite and weinberg @xcite .",
    "all of these prescriptions have a drawback : the calculations are restricted to quasi - cartesian coordinates . on the other hand , mller @xcite proposed an energy - momentum complex which enables one to calculate the energy distribution in any coordinate system and not only in quasi - cartesian coordinates .",
    "hence , an interesting question is whether any of the aforementioned prescriptions provides the best option for energy - momentum localization and , of course , under what conditions .",
    "the problem of energy - momentum localization by using the energy - momentum complexes was revived by virbhadra and his collaborators .",
    "he established an important result showing that different energy - complexes ( ellpw ) yield the same result for a general non - static spherically symmetric metric of the kerr - schild class @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these definitions ( ellpw ) comply with the quasi - local mass definition of penrose for a general non - static spherically symmetric metric of the kerr - schild class . however , these prescriptions disagree in the case of the most general non - static spherically symmetric metric . according to virbhadra , although the energy - momentum complexes behave under general coordinate transformations like non - tensorial objects , the local conservation laws obtained by them hold in all coordinate systems .",
    "also , many interesting results recently obtained @xcite-@xcite point out that the energy - momentum complexes are powerful tools for obtaining the energy distribution in a given spacetime .",
    "interesting works were done with the energy - momentum complexes in @xmath3- and @xmath4-dimensional spacetimes @xcite . in this context , of great importance",
    "is the cooperstock hypothesis @xcite which states that energy and momentum are confined to the regions of non - vanishing energy - momentum tensor for the matter and all non - gravitational fields .",
    "chang , nester and chen @xcite showed that the energy - momentum complexes are actually quasilocal and give a legitimate expression for the energy - momentum .",
    "further , they concluded that there exists a direct relationship between energy - momentum complexes and quasilocal expressions , since every energy - momentum complex is associated with a legitimate hamiltonian boundary term .",
    "regarding mller s energy - momentum complex , there is a plethora of results @xcite-@xcite that recommend it as an efficient tool for the localization of energy .",
    "according to lessner @xcite , mller s energy - momentum complex is significant for discribing the concepts of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "in fact , he stated that `` the energy - momentum four - vector can transform according to special relativity only if it is transformed to a reference system with an everywhere constant velocity .",
    "this can not be achieved by a global lorentz transformation '' .    for bondi @xcite ``",
    "a nonlocalizable form of energy is not admissible in general relativity , because any form of energy contributes to gravitation and so its location can in principle be found '' .",
    "based on the above works and conclusions we have decided to use mller s energy - momentum complex for evaluating the energy distribution of an exact solution for a static massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "consequently , in this work we have implemented mller s formalism to calculate the energy distribution for a geometry given recently by daghan and bilge @xcite .",
    "they used a series of transformations to reduce to second order the system of differential equations for the einstein s field equations with a negative cosmological constant , minimally coupled to a massless scalar field in a static , spherically symmetric background in @xmath0-dimensions . in this way , the authors obtained an exact solution in a form that generalizes the ads metric as given by matschull @xcite . throughout",
    "we use geometrized units , i.e. @xmath5 , while @xmath6 has the signature @xmath7 , greek indices run from @xmath8 to @xmath3 and latin indices run over the spatial coordinate values .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we give a short review of the concept of energy - momentum complexes and present mller s prescription .",
    "in sec.3 we briefly present the @xmath0-dimensional , spherically symmetric background used , while in sec.4 we explicitly compute the energy and momentum density distributions of the einstein - klein - gordon system using mller s energy - momentum complex .",
    "finally , in sec.5 a discussion of the obtained results and some concluding remarks are given .",
    "the conservation laws of energy and momentum for an isolated , i.e. , no external force is acting on the system , physical system in the theory of special relativity are expressed by a set of differential equations . defining @xmath9 as the symmetric energy - momentum tensor of matter and of all non - gravitational fields ,",
    "the conservation laws are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the energy density , the energy current density , and the momentum density , respectively .",
    "making the transition from special to general theory of relativity , one adopts a simplicity principle which is called principle of minimal gravitational coupling . as a result",
    ", the conservation equation is now written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath14 .",
    "the conservation equation may also be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a non - tensorial object . for @xmath17",
    "this means that the matter energy is not a conserved quantity for the physical system but this equality by no means holds in general . ] . from a physical point of view , this lack of energy conservation can be understood as the possibility of transforming matter energy into gravitational energy and vice versa . however",
    ", this remains an open problem and it is widely believed that in order to solve it one has to take into account the gravitational energy .    by a well - known procedure , the non - tensorial object @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 are certain functions of the metric tensor and its first order derivatives . therefore , the energy - momentum tensor of matter @xmath9 is replaced by the expression @xmath21 which is called energy - momentum complex since it is a combination of the tensor @xmath9 and a pseudotensor @xmath20 describing the energy and momentum of the gravitational field .",
    "the energy - momentum complex satisfies a conservation law in the ordinary sense , i.e. , @xmath22 and it can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are called superpotentials and are functions of the metric tensor and its first order derivatives .    it is evident that the energy - momentum complex is not uniquely determined by the condition that its usual divergence is zero since a quantity with an identically vanishing divergence can always be added to the energy - momentum complex .",
    "the energy - momentum complex of mller in a four - dimensional background is given as @xcite @xmath25 where mller s superpotential @xmath26 is of the form @xmath27 with the antisymmetric property @xmath28    it is easily seen that mller s energy - momentum complex satisfies the local conservation equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy density and @xmath31 are the momentum density components .",
    "thus , in mller s prescription the energy and momentum for a four - dimensional background are given by @xmath32 specifically the energy of the physical system in a four - dimensional background is @xmath33    it should be noted that the calculations are not anymore restricted to quasi - cartesian coordinates but can be utilized in any coordinate system .",
    "the line element of a three - dimensional static , spherically symmetric , lorentzian spacetime is given as @xmath34 in @xmath35 coordinates .",
    "einstein s field equations with a cosmological constant @xmath36 are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy - momentum tensor of a massless scalar field @xmath39 @xcite satisfying the wave equation : @xmath40.\\ ] ]    the above wave equation of the klein - gordon type can be integrated giving for the first derivative of the static scalar field @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an integration constant . by using a series of transformations and taking @xmath44 , daghan and bilge @xcite managed to solve analytically the above einstein - klein - gordon system of differenial equations for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath41 and obtained the following form for the line element : @xmath47^{\\mu}\\cosh \\chi\\sinh \\chi \\,d\\tilde{t}^2 + d\\chi^2+(c^2 + 4\\lambda^2)\\left[\\frac{\\cosh\\chi}{\\sinh\\chi}\\right]^{-\\mu}\\cosh\\chi\\sinh\\chi\\ , d\\tilde{\\theta}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are defined through the following transformations : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 being an integration constant and @xmath55 .",
    "+ @xmath56 and it can be seen that for @xmath57 a curvature singularity arises . furthermore , @xmath58 is related to @xmath45 and @xmath46 through @xmath59 @xmath60 while @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an integration constant too .",
    "it should be noted , that for @xmath43 = 0 and c = 1 one gets the three - dimensional anti - desitter solution given by matschull in @xcite .",
    "we first have to evaluate the superpotentials in the context of mller s prescription for the spacetime described by the line element ( [ 3.6 ] ) . there are four non - zero independent superpotentials : @xmath63 substitution of the above superpotentials into eq.([2.10 ] ) yields the energy density distribution @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an integration constant , while the momentum density distributions obtained are @xmath66 @xmath67 replacing equations ( [ 4.3]-[4.4 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 2.14 ] ) yields a zero momentum , while by substituting eq.([4.2 ] ) into eq.([2.15 ] ) , we get the energy of a massless scalar field contained in a `` sphere '' of radius @xmath68 for the three - dimensional spacetime described by the line element([3.6 ] ) @xmath69 this is also the energy of the gravitational field that the scalar field experiences at a finite distance @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the energy given by equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) is also called effective gravitational mass ( @xmath70 ) of the spacetime under study .",
    "the energy content of an infinitely large `` sphere '' is infinite , as it is also evident from figure 1 .",
    "as we pointed out previously , the subject of the localization of energy continues to be open , since einstein , in his theory of special relativity , declared that mass is equivalent to energy .",
    "_ @xcite concluded that the energy is localizable only for spherical systems . on the other hand , cooperstock and",
    "sarracino @xcite demonstrated that if the energy is localizable in spherical systems then it is also localizable in any spacetime .",
    "now , concerning the use of several energy - momentum complexes for the localization of energy and momentum , we remark that although it has many adepts , there has also been a great deal of critisism related to the use of such prescriptions .",
    "the main disadvantage of the energy - momentum complexes lies in that most of them restrict one to make calculations in quasi - cartesian coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , mller s energy - momentum complex is the only one allowing calculations in any coordinate system .",
    "in this work , we have explicitly calculated the energy and momentum density distributions associated with an exact solution of einstein s field equations with a negative cosmological constant and minimally coupled to a static massless scalar field in a static , spherically symmetric , three - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the energy and momentum distributions are computed by use of mller s energy - momentum complex .",
    "a physically acceptable expression for the energy density distribution is obtained .",
    "the momentum density distributions for the used @xmath0-dimensional , static spherically symmetric background vanish .",
    "additionally , the effective gravitational mass , i.e. the total energy , is explicitly evaluated for the specific gravitational background .",
    "we have shown that the energy distribution can be interpreted as the effective gravitational mass corresponding to the @xmath0-dimensional background .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 appearing in ( [ 4.5 ] ) expresses the strength of the coupled scalar field .",
    "one can see that for the special case @xmath72 , the three - dimensional anti - desitter spacetime is obtained .",
    "furthermore , mller s energy - momentum complex applied to this @xmath0-dimensional solution satisfies the local conservation equation ( [ 2.13 ] ) .",
    "we point out that mller s formalism provides physically satisfactory results for the aforementioned background .",
    "finally , these results support lessner s viewpoint @xcite about the significance of mller s energy - momentum complex as a powerful tool for the evaluation of the energy and momentum density distributions in a given geometry .",
