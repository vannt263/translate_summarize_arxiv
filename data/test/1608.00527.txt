    "a classical nova eruption plays an important role in the evolution of cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ; see the books by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it represents the primary mechanism for mass - loss in these systems , preventing ( most of ) them to end up as supernovae ia .",
    "irradiation of the donor star by the eruption - heated white dwarf is furthermore suspected to cause an increase in the mass - transfer rate , which would have a strong effect on the evolutionary time - scale @xcite . still , the connection between the nova eruption and the physical parameters of cvs is not very well known , mainly due to the fact that a large fraction of the post - nova systems remain unidentified @xcite .",
    "we are carrying out a systematic observing campaign in order to recover and study classical novae that erupted at least 30 yr ago ( earlier than 1986 ) .",
    "this implies that sufficient time has passed since the nova eruption for the optical signal to become dominated by the underlying cv instead of representing mainly the ejected material .",
    "the targets presented here were selected from @xcite and refer to fields with hitherto ambiguous identification of the post - nova ( el aql , v606 aql , v908 oph , v1149 sgr and v1583 sgr ) .",
    "they were investigated by means of @xmath0 photometry to identify potential candidates for the post - nova , based on their colours .",
    "the selected candidates were subsequently observed spectroscopically to confirm the post - nova via their spectroscopic characteristics ( mainly the presence of characteristic emission lines ) .",
    "in addition , we also obtained spectrograms of candidates for the post - novae v1301 aql , v1151 sgr and v3964 sgr that were included in @xcite .",

    "the grating was operated at a central wavelength of 5600  to put the two 0.915 mm wide gaps between the chips at regions of comparatively low scientific interest .",

    "the data were reduced using the gemini  gmos extension for iraf as contained in the ureka software package .",
    "after subtraction of an averaged bias frame and subsequent division by a flat - field that was normalized by fitting a high - order cubic spline , a two - dimensional wavelength correction was applied that was obtained from spectra taken with a cuar comparison lamp . after this transformation , the individual spectra were combined employing a 2@xmath9 clipping algorithm to correct for cosmic rays .",
    "the sky was subtracted by fitting a chebychev function of typically third order in spatial direction .",

    "examination of pre - discovery harvard plates by @xcite revealed the object having reached its peak brightness before that date .",
    "the brightest recorded value is 6.4 mag on 1927 june 15 , which is thus taken as maximum brightness , although observational gaps before and after that date leave room for an even brighter peak value .",
    "the decline of the nova is comparatively well covered , especially in the first 200 d after eruption .",
    "description of the spectral evolution during the decline is found in a number of publications .",
    "the most detailed data can be found in @xcite , while @xcite present the only drawing of the spectrum .    in spite of the good photometric coverage",
    ", there is no complete representation of the long - term light curve in the literature .",
    "the plot in @xcite is limited to the first 100 d , and @xcite does not include the harvard data . in fig.[elaqllc_fig ] , we collect the observations from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dates and brightness values from @xcite were extracted from his plot with a precision of 0.25 d and 0.1 mag , respectively .",
    "all other data were available in tabulated form .",
    "for data where only the start of night was given , ut = 0 h was assumed for the observation .",
    "we omitted from the plot the first four data points from @xcite , where he describes the target as ` blurred ' , because they differ drastically from those of other authors .",
    "the upper limits in the plot are from @xcite and @xcite . for reasons of visualization ,",
    "we omit another upper limit ( @xmath1716 mag ) from 1927 may 28 @xcite .",
    "after the initial decline , the nova experienced a series of minor rebrightenings and then settled on a prolonged plateau phase .",
    "there also appear to be further fluctuations around 400 and 500 d after eruption .",
    "these are based on the @xcite data only , but since in the overlapping regions his magnitudes usually agree within 0.2 mag to those of other authors , there is no reason to doubt the reality of these rebrightenings . to our knowledge , there are no further data on the nova after the seasonal gap between 540 and 720 d after eruption . assuming that this is not due to the lack of observations , the final decline must have occurred sometime during that period .",
    "@xcite observed the field again on 1940 june 5 and reported a brightness of 19 mag for the nova , but , as we argue below , this is a likely misidentification .",
    "the decline light curve is classified in @xcite as ` ba ' that includes novae with ` standstills or other minor irregular fluctuations during decline ' .",
    "although el aql is not included in the @xcite catalogue , its light curve likely corresponds to the ` p ' ( plateau ) class , and in particular , shows some similarity to hs sge , especially with respect to the rebrightenings . in el aql ,",
    "the major peak around day 63 makes it difficult to define the end of the initial decline and the start of the plateau phase . if we select the end of this event as the corresponding point , we find the following approximate values for the light - curve parameters as defined by @xcite : the time of the start of the plateau phase , and thus the duration of the initial decline , @xmath2487 d , the duration of the plateau phase @xmath25450630 d , the brightness difference between the start of the plateau phase and the peak magnitude @xmath263.9 mag , and the slope of the decline during the plateau phase to @xmath27 .",
    "these are typical values for class p novae and justify the inclusion of el aql into this category .",
    "@xcite find that this class contains a large fraction ( 6090% ) of the recurrent novae and suggest that some of the other systems in this class are yet unrecognized recurrent novae .",
    "the remaining members of the p class novae appear to be magnetic systems . a candidate for the post - nova",
    "was selected from our @xmath0 photometric data on the basis of its colours ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] , table [ ubvr_tab ] ) and its proximity ( 3 arcsec ) to the coordinates reported in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this object presents emission lines typical for a cv and we conclude that it is indeed the post - nova .",
    "its brightness is @xmath28 mag and thus considerably fainter than the 19th magnitude star observed by @xcite in 1940 .",
    "@xcite gives a value of @xmath29 mag for el aql for observations made in 1989 .",
    "it is , in principle , possible that both observations above caught the post - nova in a bright state ( or our data were taken in a low state ) .",
    "however , we consider this unlikely , because cvs in bright states are also expected to have bluer colours than in low states , and the object observed by @xcite is significantly redder in the visual range ( @xmath30 mag compared to our 0.62 mag , see table [ ubvr_tab ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that those observations did not concern the post - nova , but a different object .",
    "similarly , @xcite gives infrared data @xmath31 mag , @xmath32 mag , @xmath33 mag for el aql .",
    "this led @xcite to suspect the nova to contain a giant secondary star .",
    "however , the spectral appearance of the post - nova ( fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] ) and its position in the colour  colour diagram does not support this interpretation , and it thus again appears more likely that @xcite observed a different object .",
    "we furthermore note that the resulting eruption amplitude ( defined as the difference between the brightness of the post - nova and the maximum brightness ) of 14.5 mag basically excludes el aql as a recurrent nova candidate .",
    "el aql presents a rich emission line spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] , table [ eqw_tab ] ) .",
    "the balmer lines are exceptionally strong for an old nova , which might be indicative of a low mass - transfer rate @xcite .",
    "the strength of heii @xmath344686 and the presence of heii @xmath345412 points to a magnetic system , but since the former does not quite match the strength of h@xmath35 , el aql is more likely to be an intermediate polar rather than a discless system .",
    "the continuum has a slightly red slope , but as can be seen from the comparison of the colour  colour diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] ) , the field of el aql is significantly affected by interstellar reddening . from the irsa website",
    ", we find @xmath20 = 1.11(08 ) mag , and when corrected for that value , an inverse power law with an exponent @xmath36 provides an excellent fit to the continuum slope .    the spectroscopic data on el aql consist of four individual spectra . in fig .",

    "there is a @xmath11200 d gap of observations prior to the discovery , and it is thus possible that the real maximum has been missed .",
    "@xcite estimates the peak brightness to 5.5 mag .",
    "the observed decline light curve as shown in @xcite covers @xmath11160 d , and suggests a classification as type ` p ' @xcite . in 1991 , @xcite obtained spectroscopy of the suspected post - nova , but found a g7k4 type spectrum for a @xmath5 = 16.3 mag object .",
    "the south - western component of an unresolved visual binary that was marked in @xcite as the possible post - nova showed promising colours ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] , table [ ubvr_tab ] ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy of the @xmath5 = 20.4 mag object confirmed the nova ( fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] ) .",
    "the spectrum presents comparatively strong balmer emission lines , although not as strong as in el aql .",
    "the high excitation lines are even considerably weaker , and we do not detect heii @xmath345412 . as discussed in section [ elaql_sec ] ,",
    "most members of the ` p'-class appear to be recurrent or magnetic novae .",
    "even if we use the actually observed brightness maximum to calculate the eruption amplitude , the result of @xmath39 mag appears much too large for a recurrent nova @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectroscopic properties do not present particularly strong evidence for a magnetic nature either .",
    "apparently , v606 aql is an unusual member of the p class .",
    "the spectrum presents a slightly blue continuum slope , and the colour  colour diagram shows that the field is only moderately affected by interstellar extinction .",
    "after dereddening with a value @xmath20 = 0.35(03 ) mag , it became apparent that the continuum was distorted by a number of large ` bumps ' . after examining the three individual spectra",
    ", we concluded that the bumpy structure is not intrinsic but an artefact .",
    "however , the presence of the bumps rendered large parts of the continuum unusable for fitting .",
    "we thus chose a number of small regions of continuum between the blue emission lines as well as a couple of regions around 6000  to determine an inverse power - law exponent of @xmath40 2.02(02 ) .",
    "when examining the h@xmath23 line profile of the individual spectra , the changes are not as pronounced as in el aql , and the dopper shift of the whole profile is not as large ( fig .",
    "[ v606aqllprof_fig ] ) . still , the shape of the line profile is clearly variable , and the width of the emission lines is basically identical to those in el aql .",
    "we thus tentatively conclude that also v606 aql is likely seen at a moderately high inclination , which makes it a potential target for follow - up time series observations .",
    "very few data are available for v908 oph .",
    "its discovery was reported by @xcite who detected oi emission in a near - infrared spectrum taken on 1954 , july 2 .",
    "he estimated the brightness in this spectral range to 9 mag , but suspected that the nova was observed about a week after its maximum brightness .",
    "the only other observations consist of two objective prism spectra taken on 1954 july 27 by @xcite . apart from strong h@xmath23 emission , they could not distinguish more detailed spectral features due to the object having declined to a blue magnitude ` probably less than 14 ' .",
    "if the object was indeed observed several days after having reached its maximum brightness , and accounting for the colour differences between the two observations and for the strong interstellar reddening , the time @xmath41 to have declined by 3 mag below maximum brightness is likely to be in the order of 3040 d , which would classify the object as a moderately fast nova .",
    "the coordinates of the nova had only been recorded with a precision in the order of arcmin , but fortunately , a candidate for the post - nova can be easily identified in the colour  colour diagram ( fig .  [ ubvr_fig ] ) .",
    "its spectrum presents a few weak hydrogen emission lines , with those bluewards of h@xmath23 being embedded in absorption troughs , and a red continuum slope ( fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] ) . from the @xmath0 photometry ,",
    "it is clear that the field is strongly affected by interstellar reddening , and the respective catalogue yields an accordingly high @xmath20 = 1.26(02 ) mag .",
    "once corrected for this value , the sed corresponds to a steep blue power law with a negative exponent @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the spectral characteristics are consistent with a high mass - transfer system . in fig .",

    "there appears to be another peak that could be identified with the cii @xmath436578,6583 doublet .",
    "this line has been previously detected in a few old novae with sufficiently narrow h@xmath23 emission lines @xcite , and the latter also applies to v908 oph .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in that part of the spectrum is low , and there are a number of similar large features close - by , which we were unable to identify and thus suspect to be artefacts . in consequence ,",

    "we finally remark that we did not detect any significant positional variation of the h@xmath23 line in the three individual spectra .",
    "together with the narrowness of that line , this suggests that the system is seen at low inclination , and that it will be difficult to determine its orbital period .",
    "the nova was discovered by @xcite on an objective prism plate at a photographic brightness of about 9 mag .",
    "later research by @xcite revealed the maximum brightness to 7.4 mag .",
    "the light curve is described as a ` very steep increase in brightness [ ... ] followed by a rapid initial decrease ' , reaching a plateau by 1946 may 28 .",
    "the nova was visible from 1945 may 16 to 1948 may 30 , and afterwards fainted below 14.7 mag .",
    "large gaps in the observations prevent a more detailed analysis .    from our @xmath0 photometry ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] ) , we selected two potential candidates for the post - nova based on their colours and coordinates .",
    "spectroscopy showed one of those to present emission lines and a blue continuum , and we thus identify this object as the post - nova .",
    "it is located @xmath1111 arcsec south - west of the previously reported position .",
    "we note that these coordinates do not coincide with the objects labelled as v1149 sgr in @xcite and in @xcite .",

    "the balmer lines are comparatively narrow , and a bump on the red wing of h@xmath23 could tentatively identified with cii ( see also section [ v908oph_sec ] ) . the three individual spectra do not show any significant radial velocity variations , and thus , like v908 oph , this object is likely to be seen at a rather low system inclination .       line profiles for the three individual spectra of v1583 sgr in sequence from bottom to top .",
    "the vertical line indicates the rest wavelength of h@xmath23 . ]",
    "an examination of archival photographic plates by @xcite led to the discovery of this nova almost 30 yr after its eruption .",
    "still , in contrast to other novae , the maximum brightness of 8.9 mag on 1928 june 24 appears to be well established .",
    "the authors report that two days before that night , the nova was fainter than 15.6 mag and that it fell again below the plate detection limit 75 d after maximum brightness .",
    "the system is classified as a moderately fast nova with a decline time @xmath45 d @xcite .    from its colours ( fig .",
    "[ ubvr_fig ] , table [ ubvr_tab ] ) and its position only 3.5 arcsec off the reported coordinates , we identified a candidate for the nova .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy show a slightly reddish continuum ( fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] ) , which is likely the consequence of a comparatively strong interstellar reddening ( @xmath20 = 1.09(04 ) mag ) .",
    "like for most of the other systems , the corrected sed presents a blue slope , with @xmath46 .",
    "superposed are moderately strong emission lines ( table [ eqw_tab ] ) of the balmer and hei series .",
    "similar to v908 oph ( section [ v908oph_sec ] ) , the bowen blend and heii @xmath344686 lines are weak and hardly detectable .",
    "the emission lines are also comparatively narrow , but still the line profile shows some clear asymmetric structure and marked differences between the individual exposures ( fig .  [ v1583sgrlprof_fig ] ) .",
    "we especially notice that the line strength in the third spectrum of that series is significantly diminished , which indicates that the emission source is being obscured .",
    "a possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy between narrow lines and an obscuration effect is that the system is seen at high inclination , but that the doppler - broadened component of the line profile produced by the disc is weak and that the line profile is dominated by a narrow component that originates on the secondary star . in any case",

    "however , examination of the 2d spectra showed the possibility of h@xmath23 emission from a different star in the slit , and a likely source of this emission was identified . here",
    ", we present further spectroscopic observations of that target .",
    "the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ allspec_fig ] clearly reveals it as the post - nova system , presenting the typical hydrogen and helium emission lines , as well as a weak bowen blend .",
    "the continuum has a red slope , but like in the other objects , this is due to interstellar reddening .",
    "still , even after the correction for @xmath20 = 0.56(01 ) mag , the slope appears significantly flatter than in the other systems , being represented by an exponent @xmath23 = 1.43(03 ) .",
    "the emission lines are not particularly strong ( table [ eqw_tab ] ) , but broad , and even show , at times , a hint of a double - peaked disc profile ( fig .",
    "[ v3964sgrlprof_fig ] ) .",
    "furthermore , like in v1583 sgr ( section [ v1583sgr_sec ] ) , the emission line in the third spectrum is significantly diminished compared to the other two spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "a possible doppler shift of the line is less clear .",
    "still , the width of the line , the potential obscuration effect and the flat slope of the corrected continuum suggest that v3964 sgr is seen at a comparatively high inclination .",
    "thus , it should be feasible to determine the orbital period with time series photometry .      together with v3964 sgr ( section [ v3964sgr_sec ] )",
    ", we had also reported on candidates for the novae v1301 aql and v1151 sgr that turned out to be misidentifications .",
    "for both targets , we had indicated alternative candidates in the immediate vicinity of the original targets . in the current observing run",
    ", we incorporated some of these new candidates , namely the objects marked as ` w1 ' and ` w2 ' for v1301 aql , and the one marked as ` 1 ' in the case of v1151 sgr .",
    "all objects show rather unremarkable spectra with reddish continua and balmer lines in absorption . `",

    "+    in table [ prop_tab ] we have collected several distinguished properties of the here presented post - novae .",
    "these are the maximum brightness @xmath47 , the brightness of the post - nova @xmath48 at the time of our observations and the resulting eruption amplitude defined as @xmath56 . in the next two columns , we give the time @xmath50 that has passed between the nova eruption and our spectroscopic data and the time @xmath41 by which the nova had declined to 3 mag below maximum brightness .",
    "the parameters in the subsequent two columns are associated with the determination of the continuum slope , representing the catalogued value for the interstellar reddening @xmath20 and the negative exponent @xmath23 of the fitted power law ( section [ results_sec ] ) .",
    "the next three columns give selected properties of the h@xmath23 emission line : the equivalent width @xmath51 and the fwhm of a gaussian fit to the line , the latter both in wavelength and in velocity units .",
    "the final column states the deviation of the position of an object from the originally recorded coordinates of the nova eruption as given by @xcite .    since the absolute maximum brightness of novae shows a scatter of typically only 23 mag @xcite , but the absolute brightness of cvs in quiescence is distributed over a range of @xmath119 mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , differences in @xmath49 will mostly reflect the difference in the brightness of the post - nova .",
    "the latter principally depends on the brightness of the accretion disc ( or , more generally , on the emission from the accretion process ) , and thus on the mass - transfer rate @xmath57 and on the system inclination @xmath58 @xcite . because @xmath47 can be assumed to be largely independent of these two quantities , @xmath49 can be taken as an indicator of the absolute brightness of the post - nova and of the involved parameters .",
    "apart from the spread in the absolute maximum brightness , additional uncertainties are introduced by the possibility that the recorded @xmath47 does not correspond to the real maximum brightness , but that the nova was observed at some later point , and by the different passbands used for @xmath47 and for @xmath48 . while in general , the colour differences in the optical range for cvs will amount to less than 1 mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these differences will be enhanced in regions with strong interstellar reddening .",
    "a thorough analysis of @xmath49 will thus have to correct for these effects .",
    "however , here we only aim at a rough classification of our post - novae within the cv subtypes , and we will do so by also considering other parameters , thus reducing the weight of above uncertainties .",
    "further quantities of table [ prop_tab ] that are indicative of @xmath57 are @xmath23 and @xmath51 .",
    "the significance of the former and the involved uncertainties have already been presented in section [ results_sec ] .",
    "the indicative power of the latter stems from low-@xmath57 , optically thin discs producing stronger emission lines than high-@xmath57 , optically thick ones @xcite .",
    "however , in cvs , typically the accretion disc is not the sole contributor to the emission line profile @xcite . because post - novae contain an eruption heated white dwarf , irradiation of the secondary star is likely to produce an additional emission component .",
    "furthermore , there is also the possibility that the ejected material still contributes to the line profile especially in ` younger ' , i.e.  more recent post - novae . finally , because the continuum emission depends on @xmath58 , so does @xmath51 @xcite , and thus in our interpretation , we will also use the width of the line fwhm , which is indicative of @xmath58 due to the larger projected velocity values @xmath59 sampled in the line profile .",
    "el aql and v606 aql are the novae with the largest eruption amplitudes in the present sample . indeed , a comparison with fig.7 in shows that there are only @xmath1110 novae in our sample of pre-1986 eruptions with similar large @xmath49",
    "the idea of this parameter being an indicator for the disc brightness in these two systems fits well with the comparatively strong emission lines . on the other hand , the lines are also broad , and thus additionally , the inclination will have contributed to the high value of @xmath49 . while , for v606",
    "aql , also @xmath23 is in agreement with a comparatively low-@xmath57 disc , this is not the case for el aql .",
    "however , we note that the steepest continuum slopes are found for the systems with the largest interstellar reddening .",
    "this appears suspicious and suggests a tendency to overcorrect for this effect .",
    "v908 oph and v1149 sgr have the smallest @xmath49 and are also spectroscopically consistent with an optically thick disc and thus high @xmath57 in that they present only weak emission lines . in v908 oph ,",
    "the bluer hydrogen lines are even embedded in absorption troughs .",
    "still , also here the line width suggests that the inclination is such that it amplifies that effect . in conclusion , because of the strong dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath19 on @xmath58 , those four post - novae could have very similar intrinsic properties with respect to @xmath57 in spite of their different spectroscopic appearance .",
    "the picture is somewhat different for the remaining two systems .",
    "v1583 sgr presents narrow , but comparatively strong emission lines with a variable line profile and medium @xmath49 .",
    "we interpret this as the combination of a broad but weak disc line profile and a narrow component that likely originates in the secondary star . in this way",
    ", all parameters would agree with v1583 sgr having a medium to high @xmath49 and a medium to high inclination .",
    "assuming that the narrow component is produced by irradiation , we would also expect that either the white dwarf in this system is still very hot or that the orbital period is comparatively short .",
    "because of the ` age ' of the post - nova ( @xmath50 = 87 yr ) , the latter appears more likely . finally , v3964 sgr has broad and weak lines and shows a possible obscuration effect in one spectrum .",
    "this points to a high-@xmath57 system seen at high inclination .",
    "the recorded medium @xmath49 represents only a lower limit that , if the speculations by @xcite are correct , could be up to 3 mag larger .",
    "thus , it would also be in agreement with a high @xmath58 .",
    "last , not least , the continuum slope appears rather flat for the suspected high @xmath57 , but again might reflect a high system inclination .    in , we have argued that there is a high probability that the cvs detected by us do , in fact , represent the post - novae corresponding to the respective nova eruption and not different cvs that coincidentally have similar coordinates .",
    "our first point was that the low space density of cvs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) makes it unlikely that more than one cv could be present in a field of a few square arcmin and a limiting magnitude of @xmath6024 mag , although a proper quantitative treatment would have to take into account a detailed model of the galactic structure .",
    "as a second point of support to our argumentation , we estimated our detection probability of a specific post - nova system .",
    "this is based on the limiting magnitude @xmath61 of our photometry , calculated as the faintest object that is detected in @xmath0 and has s / n = 5 in @xmath5 , corresponding to an uncertainty in the @xmath5 brightness of 0.198 mag .",
    "this gives us the maximum amplitude @xmath62 that a nova with a brightness at maximum @xmath47 can have to still be detected in that specific photometry .",
    "finally , the fraction of novae with @xmath63 translates into the detection probability .",
    "this probability is not fixed , but depends on our current knowledge of the @xmath49 distribution . as of 2016",
    "may 15 , we count 92 pre-1986 post - novae with known @xmath49 , with the shape of the distribution suggesting that it is biased to bright , small-@xmath49 post - novae .",
    "our estimate furthermore ignores the possibility that a nova could have very unusual colours and thus is not recognized as such .",
    "table [ prop_tab ] shows that four of our objects were detected within 5 arcsec of the reported eruption and thus in its immediate vicinity .",
    "we estimate the possibility of a different cv being present within this radius to have a very low probability , making it unnecessary to additionally calculate the detection probability for them .",
    "v1149 sgr is slightly farther off , but only v908 oph shows a very large discrepancy , due to the low precision of the coordinates of the nova eruption . for the photometries of v1149 sgr and of v908 oph",
    "we find @xmath61 = 23.0 and 20.5 mag , and thus @xmath64 = 15.6 and 11.5 mag , respectively .",
    "the much lower brightness and @xmath64 limit for v908 oph is not due a lower quality of the photometry but a result of the strong interstellar reddening causing less than 1 per cent of the objects detected in @xmath10 being also detected in @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding detection probabilities then calculate to 99 and 55 per cent . additionally taking into account the small positional deviation to the reported coordinates",
    ", we can thus be confident that v1149 sgr is indeed the post - nova . for v908 oph",
    ", the case is less clear , and both parameters leave room for speculation . here ,",
    "basically the only argument supporting the identification of this system with the post - nova of nova oph 1954 is the absence of other candidates in the field .",
    "1 .   we have used @xmath0 photometry and optical spectroscopy to recover the post - novae el aql , v606 aql , v908 oph , v1149 sgr , v1583 sgr and v3964 sgr .",
    "we furthermore report on spectroscopy of candidates for the post - novae v1301 aql and v1151 sgr , 2 .",
    "historic observations of el aql were collected to build a complete eruption light curve that allows it to be classified as a class p nova @xcite .",
    "its eruption amplitude and colours indicate that the previously suspected possibility that el aql is a recurrent nova , is based on source confusion .",
    "furthermore , its spectroscopic features suggest that the object belongs to the group of intermediate polars .",
    "3 .   comparison of several properties of the novae indicates that the differences in the spectroscopic appearances of el aql , v606 aql , v908 oph and v1149 sgr regarding the aspect of the mass - transfer rate are likely to be an effect of the system inclination and thus do not allow for a conclusive classification .",
    "the shape of the h@xmath23 emission line profile in v1583 sgr indicates that it is dominated by a non - disc emission component , likely originating in the irradiated donor star .",
    "inspection of the emission line profiles of the individual spectra proposes el aql , v606 aql , v1583 sgr and v3964 sgr as good candidates for time series observations in order to determine the orbital period .",
    "we have calculated the probability that the detected objects are , in fact , the post - novae corresponding to the reported eruptions .",
    "we have found that the only potentially ambiguous case is that of v908 oph , where the low precision of the reported nova coordinates and the strong interstellar reddening strongly reducing the number of objects detected in @xmath3 leave some room for doubt .",
    "still , in the absence of other candidates , the here presented object should be regarded as the post - nova .",
