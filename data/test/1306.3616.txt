    "the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors is an important problem of modern condensed matter physics , in particular due to the necessity to describe correctly the ultrafast laser pulse experiments @xcite , including the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) case @xcite , in nanostructures and other systems .",
    "this problem is a part of a more general problem of the nonequilibrium nonlinear behavior of quantum matter at ultrashort time scales , one of the most complicated and important problems of modern physics .",
    "it is extremely important to understand this behavior from both fundamental science and technological points of view , and the fwm experiments is one of the most powerful and promising tools currently used for this purpose .",
    "a fundamental process in the fwm experiments is generation of multiple excitonic states , which can have variety of practical applications from optoelectronic devices @xcite to quantum computing @xcite . in many cases , including the ultrafast response , the nonlinear effects , which come from the time - dependent exciton - exciton interaction , are very important . to our knowledge ,",
    "these were studied only in the framework of many - body effective models by deriving and solving the effective third - order equation for the polarization ( see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the nonlinear effects come from the time - dependent exciton - exciton interactions defined by the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "due to the complexity of the problem , the time - dependent correlation function is usually approximated by a phenomenological expression .",
    "since the optical response strongly depends on the form of this expression @xcite , it is highly desirable to obtain the form of the effective interaction from a simple but fundamental approach that does not include ( or at least includes a minimal number of ) phenomenological parameters . for this purpose",
    ", we propose to use tddft @xcite .",
    "it was already successfully applied to study the excitonic effects in the frameworks of the time - dependent optimized effective potential approach @xcite , in combination with the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite , and by solving the tddft version of the semiconductor bloch equations ( sbes , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xcite .",
    "we recently generalized the last approach to the biexcitonic case @xcite .",
    "in most of these papers , the contribution of the exciton - exciton interaction to the optical absorption spectrum was neglected . only in ref .",
    "@xcite the nonlinear excitonic effects were taken into account by solving a nonlinear system of the tddft - sbes . however , it was difficult to identify the nonlinear contribution from such a general solution .",
    "in addition , since the adiabatic approximation was used , the time - resolved exciton - exciton interaction was neglected in this case . as we show below",
    ", the non - adiabaticity of the xc kernels is a crucial requirement for the development of a theory based on tddft to describe nonlinear correlation effects including the formation of exciton - exciton bound states ( biexcitons ) .",
    "another requirement , which follows from all the studies mentioned above , is the necessity to go beyond the lda and gga approximation in order to obtain even single - exciton effects .",
    "currently , possible structures of the non - adiabatic xc potentials are much less understood comparing to the cases of static dft and adiabatic tddft . however , the frequency dependence of the xc potential is not only important for the description of the exciton - exciton interaction but also for various static problems such as multiple excitations @xcite and time - dependent problems when the system response is analyzed ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we use the available exact knowledge of the asymptotic limits of the xc kernels at low and high frequencies and some experimental data to construct the non - adiabatic part of the kernels that are able to describe the effects of the exciton - exciton correlations within tddft , including biexcitonic bound states .",
    "we test the approach by calculating the response of a gaas quantum well in a fwm experiment and demonstrate that the approach is capable to describe the main features of the spectrum .",
    "the method proposed here can be used in a more general case to study the non - adiabatic response within tddft .",
    "in order to derive the nonlinear equation for the polarization , we use the density - matrix representation of tddft . for simplicity , we consider the three - band case ( two heavy- and light - hole valence bands and one conduction band ) , though the generalization to more bands is straightforward . in the density - matrix tddft ,",
    "one looks for the solution of the time - dependent kohn - sham ( ks ) equation @xmath0 as a linear combination of the wave functions which corresponds to the static solution , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the band number . in the last equation , @xmath3({\\bf r},t )",

    "we use the dipole approximation for the external perturbation arising from the electric field pulse , @xmath9 which corresponds to the case of high frequencies , comparing to the spacing between the energy levels . in the three - band case",
    ", the wave function can be approximated as a linear combination of the valence and the conduction electron wave - functions : @xmath10 and the problem reduces to the solution of the liouville equation @xmath11_{{\\bf k}}^{lm } , \\label{liouville}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the matrix elements of the hamiltonian with respect to the static wave - functions and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 density matrix , whose diagonal elements correspond to the band occupancies @xmath15 and the non - diagonal elements - to the direct and the inverse ( including excitonic ) coherences @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for simplicity , we take into account only the vertical transitions since in most cases the photon momentum can be neglected .",
    "the explicit form of the system of independent liouville equations have the form of the sbes @xcite for the excited electron density @xmath18 and polarization @xmath16 ( for details , see ref .",
    "we shall consider the nonlinear equation for the exciton polarization by taking into account the terms up to the third order in @xmath16 ( or , more precisely , in @xmath19 ) .",
    "this can be done by expanding the nonlinear part @xmath20 of the matrix elements @xmath21 in powers of the fluctuating particle density @xmath22 i.e. @xmath23 where the expression in the brackets is the taylor expansion of the functional @xmath24 , including the space - time integration over the internal variables . as it follows from the definition of the wave - function and the density - matrix",

    "@xmath37 are the kohn - sham  exciton \" wave functions , and @xmath38 is the second derivative of the xc kernel with respect to the charge density .",
    "similar equations can be written for the polarization @xmath31 with interchange of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( [ polarization])-([f12 ] ) .",
    "let us briefly discuss the meaning of the approximation which results in eq.([polarization ] ) .",
    "this equation follows from the following nonequilibrium part of the xc energy : @xmath39 indeed , in this case one can express the fluctuation of the electron charge density in terms of the polarizations @xmath40 and substitute it into eq .",
    "( [ exc ] ) , which results in eq .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) . in derivation of eq .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) we took into account only the terms proportional to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the expression for the nonequilibrium exciton thermodynamic potential , because these terms give the largest contribution to the energy due to the minimal number of oscillating factors @xmath44 in front of each @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the corresponding exciton frequency ) , in analogy to the case of the two - component @xmath47 model @xcite .",
    "we assume that the time arguments in the first two and the last two densities in the last term in @xmath48 are equal .",
    "this approximation corresponds to the mapping the effective action on the corresponding effective action of free biexcitons : @xmath49 assuming that @xmath50 and that the inverse biexciton propagator @xmath51 .",
    "in order to find the 2d fourier spectrum of the system in the case of a three - pulse excitation , one needs to find the third - order polarization @xmath52 given on the left - hand side of eq.([polarization ] ) .",
    "this can be done by inserting the solution for the linear polarizations into the right - hand side of the equation and then by making the fourier transform with respect to the delay @xmath53 and the measurement @xmath54 times , which results in the spectrum that depends on the frequencies @xmath55 and @xmath56 , correspondingly . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the initial pulse takes place at time @xmath57 , while two other pulses occur at times @xmath58 .",
    "the first - order polarization can be found by solving the equation which consists of the first two lines in eq .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) .",
    "the solution is @xmath59 were @xmath60 and @xmath60 are the energy and the lifetime of the @xmath2-exciton .    in order to obtain biexcitons",
    ", one needs to consider a retarded exciton interaction @xmath61 @xcite . before presenting the numerical results of the application of our approach , it is useful to discuss the conditions which @xmath61 has to satisfy in order to obtain the biexcitonic peaks . as it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , for this purpose in the similar equation for the polarization in the many - body case , the memory function can be approximated by @xmath62 where `` the heat bath '' spectral density @xmath63 in the low - frequency limit , which defines the long - time asymptotic behavior of the system , can be approximated by a power function @xmath64 .",
    "this function defines the dissipation processes for given exciton due to the environment consisting of the surrounding excitons . in the case , when @xmath65 is smaller , equal or larger than @xmath32 , the dissipation is called `` sub - ohmic '' , `` ohmic '' and `` super - ohmic '' , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the spectral function must decay at large frequencies , the general form of the spectral density was approximated by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the frequency scale and a is the normalization constant . in the case of a one - dimensional model for the excitons , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath68 .    in tddft ,",
    "the memory effects are described by the matrix elements of the first and second derivatives of the xc kernel .",
    "one can in principle construct a @xmath69 to reproduce ( [ f2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the equation for the polarization and its solution , including the biexcitonic features , will coincide with the many - body case .",
    "while there are known constraints on the frequency - dependent ( non - adiabatic ) part of @xmath70 at small and large frequencies , the full dependence of @xmath69 has not been discussed in detail so far .",
    "in particular , it is known that the exact asymptotic of the xc kernel at large frequencies is @xmath71 @xcite . in the low - frequency limit ,",
    "the information about the exact behavior of @xmath70 is more limited .",
    "it is known that it can have poles in the case of a finite system in the discrete part of the spectrum .",
    "one can construct the frequency - dependence of the xc kernel for all ranges of frequencies by using results of the homogeneous electron gas : @xmath72 @xcite . from these results",
    "one can suggest the following rather general form for the non - adiabatic part of the xc kernel : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 , though @xmath76 is also worth of special attention . since our main goal is to explore the role of non - adiabaticity in the nonlinear response",
    ", we assume that full kernel is the product of the frequency part eq.([fxcheg ] ) and the spatial part @xmath77 : @xmath78 { \\tilde f}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')$ ] , which allows us to separate the spatial and temporal contributions to the interaction , and which makes the analysis more transparent .",
    "more general case of the kernel may be considered , though we believe that main non - adiabatical effects in the many - exciton system can be captured by this function .",
    "it is also natural to assume that the retardation effects in the exciton case ( @xmath69 ) are described by the same time - dependence as in the electron case ( @xmath70 ) , because the excitons are composed of `` the elementary '' quasi - particles , electrons and holes , interacting through the retarded interaction given above . indeed , using the frequency - dependence eq .",
    "( [ fxcheg ] ) for @xmath69 one can demonstrate that the corresponding 2dfs includes biexcitonic features , similar to the many - body approximation case eqs .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) , ( [ rho ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , using such an approximation gives rise to many questions about the physical meaning of the corresponding spectral function , in particular : can one assume that the heat-(or exciton- ) bath dissipation results in the formation of biexcitonic states ?",
    "this question is nontrivial and deserve a deep study . in this paper , we use a simplified form of @xmath79 by making the analogy with the many - body theory , where the biexciton propagator @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ biexcitonmanybody ] ) must contain poles at the biexciton frequencies .",
    "this means that we postulate that such poles must be present in @xmath69 .",
    "namely , we approximate @xmath81 the approximation in the time - dependence of the kernel derivative corresponds to taking into account only the two - particle interactions in the xc energy ( [ exc ] ) .",
    "namely it is assumed that `` the quasi - particle '' @xmath82 at time @xmath54 ( two electrons at points @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) interacts with the one @xmath85 at time @xmath86 ( two holes at points @xmath87 , @xmath87 ) , which can be easily seen from eq.([exc ] ) : @xmath88 in this case , the pole structure of @xmath89 is contained in @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the weight , @xmath93+@xmath94 are the spectrum and the decay rate for the biexciton state formed by two excitons described by the orbital @xmath95 and the momentum @xmath96 quantum numbers .",
    "indeed , the pole structure ( [ fpole ] ) guarantees that the largest contribution to @xmath48 ( eq .  ( [ exc2 ] ) ) come from the states at the resonant frequencies , e.g. the two excited - electron , two exciton , and in our case , the biexciton frequencies .",
    "this is physically reasonable situation , since we are assuming that there are only exciton or two - exciton ( biexcitonic ) excitations in the system .",
    "the imaginary part of the structure ( [ fpole ] ) maybe regarded as a particular case of the lorentzian type kernel ( [ fxcheg ] ) .",
    "a pole structure of @xmath70 capable to describe the multiple excitations with tddft was considered , for example , in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a similar structure for the kernel second derivative @xmath69 eq.([fpole ] ) . in eq.([fpole ] ) we again separate the spatial and temporal parts for the sake of simplicity of the analysis . from eq.([fpole ] ) one can easily the structure of the corresponding non - adiabatic part of the xc kernel : @xmath97",
    "we apply the formalism above to analyze the effect of the memory function on the two - dimensional fourier spectrum of a gaas multiple quantum well and compare the results with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the result for the spectrum depends on the the heavy and light exciton frequencies and lifetimes @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and the memory function @xmath79 .",
    "dft calculations with the quantum espresso code @xcite with lda potential were used to generate the static wave functions ( since the width of the quantum well is usually rather large ( @xmath10110 nm ) , we used the bulk approximation to generate the wave functions ) . with this input we used also the experimental results for the heavy and light exciton frequencies @xmath102 and for the heavy - light hole biexciton binding energy",
    "@xmath103.@xcite we use one value @xmath104 for the exciton and biexciton lifetimes , which agrees with the experimental estimations.@xcite finally , we use @xmath69 defined ( [ g ] ) defined by memory function ( [ fpole ] ) and for the the spatial part we us an adiabatic lda approximation : @xmath105 we compared the solutions with both adiabatic and non - adiabatic @xmath106 . as the main result , it follows from our calculations that it is impossible to obtain the non - diagonal ( biexciton ) peaks using an instant ( adiabatic ) exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "in contrast , it is absolutely necessary to use the non - adiabatic exciton - exciton interaction in order to obtain two diagonal states ( that correspond two heavy and two light excitons peaks ) and the non - diagonal ( heavy - light exciton , as in co - circular excitation experiment@xcite ) bound state state in the 2dfs ( fig .",

    "we applied the approach to study the 2dfs of a gaas quantum well system and showed that the main features of the spectrum , including biexcitons , can be reproduced within the tddft approach .",
