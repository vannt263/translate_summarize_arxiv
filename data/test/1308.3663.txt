    "physically , any living being is a heat engine consuming fuel ( food ) and an oxidizer ( oxygen , commonly ) and producing some mechanical work accompanied by production of heat . in such capacity , we exclude plants , mushrooms , etc . the so called autotrophic organisms from consideration .",
    "keeping the analysis exclusively to the animals , we also should divide them into two basic classes : haematocryal ( or poikilothermal ) creatures , and homoiothermal creatures .",
    "obviously , the animals from both classes have to produce some heat , as a by - product of the mechanical work being done .",
    "the point is that poikilothermal animals ( those from the first class ) are considered to be in a thermal equilibrium with the environment , while the homoiothermal ones exhibit good maintenance of the body temperature .",
    "the difference is crucial , from the point of view of excessive , or `` junk '' heat production",
    ".    any creature producing mechanical work using a fuel oxygenation may not be in absolute temperature equilibrium with the environment .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 has a figure proximal to @xmath2 , where @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , respectively ) is the excess heat that can be produced by a poikilothermal animal ( by a homoiothermal animal , respectively ) .",
    "the diversity of living conditions observed worldwide is beyond imagination .",
    "it seems to be surprising , but it is nt so : the most general biological laws force a need to inhabit every possible space . in spite of the great biological significance of these laws",
    ", we will not discuss it here .",
    "such dense inhabitation poses another problem in the modelling of thermal regulation of both poikilothermal and homoiothermal animals : the problem of overheating .",
    "indeed , any living being lives within a clearly determined range of environmental conditions , where temperature is one of the most important parameters .",
    "thus , a model of thermal regulation must take into account this problem from both `` ends '' of the viable temperature range .    from the thermodynamics point of view metabolism",
    "is a chain of non - equilibrium chemical reactions in which energy is produced and consumed by the body .",
    "these reactions generally form a _ steady state process _ ( the process which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium , but has no dependency on time ) .",
    "steady state is more general than _ dynamic equilibrium _ because it accepts that some of the processes may be irreversible .",
    "if a system is in a steady state then some flows and entropy production may be non zero , while certain properties of the system are unchanging in time @xcite .",
    "this article describes neither metabolism in general , nor particular mechanisms of energy generation by certain chemical reactions or mechanical work of the muscles .",
    "these details can be found elsewhere ( good starting points would be @xcite , and @xcite ) .    it is a well known fact that a significant part of the generated energy is released in the form of _ heat _ and part of the heat is not used for any purpose inside the body .",
    "this excess heat must be transferred out of any endothermic animal s body core .",
    "the transfer itself must involve minimal extra activity for maximum efficiency .",
    "excess heat should be dissipated as passively as possible .",
    "the best candidate would be convection and diffusion into the ambience through the shell ( skin ) of the animal .",
    "one serious flaw of the present models is that they use newton s cooling approach to estimate energy balance and/or the temperature of an animal .",
    "this would seem to be incorrect because the animal is not cooling , but is actively regulating to keep constant temperature .",
    "newton s cooling may be a proper description of some processes that establish thermal equilibrium , while living systems struggle against thermal equilibrium because it is an euphemism of `` death '' from the point of view of life .",
    "the animal model follows the well known  core and shell  description of an animal s body @xcite .",
    "the model describes heat transfer through the shell ( skin ) of an animal .",
    "the importance of this heat dissipation mechanism is based on the heat dissipation limit theory introduced in @xcite .",
    "other modes of heat dissipation ( e.g. dog s panting ) are not in the scope of model .",
    "the model describes heat dissipation from an animal that performs at near to rest metabolism , and is situated in an environment with a temperature that is within the thermo neutral zone ( tnz ) of the animal .",
    "major theoretical foundations of heat dissipation by animals can be found in @xcite .",
    "the model is not related to the animal as a whole , but rather describes local behaviour of heat transfer and possible mechanisms of heat transfer regulation .",
    "animal body is schematically presented in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the _ core _ is the animal body s central compartment , where the heat is generated by metabolic processes . from the point of view of the proposed model",
    "the metabolism is a chain of irreversible , non - equilibrium chemical reactions producing energy that is utilized in the body .",
    "these reactions generally form a _ steady state process _ ( the non - equilibrium thermodynamic process having no dependency on time ) .    the major factor of the core functionality model is the well known fact that a significant part of the generated energy is released in form of _ heat _ and part of the heat is not used for any purposes inside the body",
    ". the rate of this heat generation is further noted as _ rate of the excessive heat generation _ , or @xmath3 .",
    "density ( volumetric ) of @xmath3 is mentioned below as @xmath4 .",
    "it is important that @xmath3 is produced by an _",
    "irreversible process _ , i.e. metabolism .      the model does not concern itself with internal functionality of the core , but is focused on heat flow from the core to the ambience .",
    "the first assumption is that the _ core is a large , homogeneous closed system and does not have effective spatial structure_. this assumption allows us to consider the core as a system that is entirely in a steady state , and allow us to ignore local ( i.e. internal to the core ) flows , mass transfer , and to use semi - classical approaches for core temperature calculations .",
    "this `` large system '' assumption follows the idea that the core has permanent volume , and does not produce any work : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the differential of internal energy of the core .",
    "a further assumption is that the _ core should always _",
    "( on the model s time scale ) _ be in a steady state_. it means that total entropy production of the core @xmath7 , where @xmath8 due to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "since internal entropy is generated in an irreversible process ( metabolism ) , all excessive heat should be transferred to the core externals ( see details in @xcite ) : @xmath9 it means that core internal energy is constant : @xmath10 and the core temperature @xmath11 does not depend on time : @xmath12    note that the full differential @xmath13 is implemented instead of classical `` imperfect differential '' @xmath14 because the model describes steady states of non - equilibrium processes , as opposed to classical descriptions of thermodynamic equilibrium , see @xcite for detailed explanation .",
    "a specific core temperature @xmath15 is one of the properties of a steady state , and may have a different figure in other steady states . at the same time , metabolism depends on some enzymes whose performance depend ( among other factors ) on temperature , so keeping @xmath15 inside a preferred temperature range , or even constant , is an advantage .",
    "these considerations lead us to the following assumptions of the core model :     = -15pt    core heat production @xmath3 is constant ( @xmath4 is a stationary function of coordinates ) ;    core temperature @xmath15 is a stationary function of coordinates regardless of external parameters .    basically , these assumptions ( or constraints if we speak about thermoregulation ) define simplified thermodynamics of an endothermic animal .",
    "entropy balance equation , constant internal energy equation , core heat production rate @xmath4 , and stationary distribution of temperature inside the core can be combined into a _ continuity equation _ that is simply another form of the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the core surface , @xmath18 is the heat flow , @xmath19 is the outward - pointing unit normal to @xmath17 , @xmath20 is a parameter that defines coordinates on the surface , @xmath21 denotes entire space of the core , @xmath4 is the density of heat generated in the core ( see above ) , and @xmath22 is a coordinate inside the core ( figure  [ fig : model ] illustrates this scheme ) .    equation simply means that _ total outgoing heat flow is equal to the total heat generation rate of the core_. one can apply gauss theorem ( divergence theorem ) to re - write   as @xmath23 and write a differential form of the continuity equation for stationary distribution of heat in the core : @xmath24 equation is written for unit volume ( in volumetric quantities ) .",
    "this equation is valid for any sub - volume of the core .",
    "thus we can continue with the model applied to an arbitrary volume @xmath25 that is adjacent to the shell and is separated ( conventionally ) from the core by surface @xmath26 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] .    to have a well - defined physical problem in @xmath25",
    ", we must define the boundary conditions for the equation  .",
    "since we assume constant heat generation rate @xmath27 in the core , then the equation can be written as @xmath28 note that @xmath18 may be a function of time on any given part of the surface @xmath17 , while the whole integral can not .",
    "we assume that any time dependency in @xmath29 is a very slow function : @xmath30    with this assumption we can finally formulate the local heat balance equation for the core : @xmath31 where all quantities are volumetric , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 by definition and by choice of the coordinate system .",
    "note that we have not discussed any properties of the flux @xmath34 yet , and the problem   is a very general representation of the heat balance equation .",
    "the model provides the description of this flux by the means of a convection - diffusion equation ( advection - diffusion equation ) .",
    "the different names for the same equation are used depending on the nature of the subject : `` convection '' is correctly used for vector quantities like magnetic field @xmath35 , and `` advection '' is correctly used for scalar quantities like heat @xmath36 .",
    "the difference can be very important under certain circumstances . nevertheless , it is not important in our case and we continue to use `` convection - diffusion equation '' as a more familiar term .",
    "the model stipulates that @xmath34 is a combination of two types of flux : _ diffusive flux _",
    "due to thermal diffusion , and _ advective flux _ which is the flux associated with advection of heat by the flow of fluid : @xmath37 the model assumes that the diffusive flux is caused by the temperature gradient between the core and shell , and that the convection exists due to the blood flow inside the core and from the core to the shell .",
    "blood can work extremely well in advection of heat because the viscosity of blood is  45 times higher than the viscosity of water ( including salt water ) ,",
    "so the velocity boundary layer exceeds the diffusive boundary layer in greater proportion than that of water ( i.e.  prandtl number @xmath38 , while @xmath39 at the typical core temperature @xmath40 ) .",
    "prandtl number is defined as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the specific heat , @xmath43 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath44 is the thermal conductivity of the fluid .",
    "discussion of exact properties of the blood and blood flow falls beyond the scope of this article and can be found in other researches ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "advective flux is proportional to the velocity : @xmath45 where @xmath36 is heat , and @xmath46 is the velocity of the fluid bearing the thermal energy ( e.g. blood @xcite ) .",
    "diffusive flux can be approximated by fourier s law : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is diffusivity and is defined as _ thermal diffusivity _",
    "@xmath49 for the heat transfer applications @xcite .    in this definition",
    ", @xmath44 is the _ thermal conductivity _ ( si unit of @xmath50 )",
    ", @xmath51 is density , and @xmath52 is _ specific heat capacity_. thermal diffusivity has si unit of @xmath53 and is the material property . under these approximations the total flux from the core to the shell can be presented as : @xmath54 and the heat balance equation   for the flux converts to the equation for the heat  @xmath36 : @xmath55 where the additional boundary condition on the ( virtual ) surface @xmath26 has been added to make the problem ( now the second order pde ) well - defined .    the boundary condition on @xmath26 is dirichlet ( the first type ) boundary condition .",
    "this type of boundary conditions is necessary here to make the solution unique ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the surface @xmath26 can be an arbitrary one with known temperature distribution , or an isothermal surface , according to suitability , or conforming to the core internal structure ( e.g. tissues morphology ) .",
    "the boundary condition on @xmath17 is robin ( the third type ) boundary condition .",
    "this type of boundary condition for the convection - diffusion equation is a general form of the _ impedance boundary condition _ ( insulating in case of @xmath56 ) .",
    "the latter is quite common in thermodynamic problems , especially for the convective heat exchange applications , see @xcite for comprehensive introduction .",
    "it should be noted that the boundary condition on @xmath17 is natural and has a meaning of neumann ( the second type ) boundary condition in this model , because it simply defines a heat flow across the boundary .",
    "the flow has a convective part demonstrating that @xmath17 is not rigid and has some permeability .",
    "this boundary position can be estimated using pclet number @xmath57 .",
    "this number is defined as @xmath58 for heat transfer applications , where @xmath59 is a characteristic length , @xmath60 is a characteristic velocity , @xmath48 is a thermal diffusivity ( as defined above ) , @xmath61 is a reynolds number , @xmath62 is a prandtl number .",
    "the pclet number has the meaning of : @xmath63 according to this definition , we can say that @xmath17 lies in a region where the pclet number @xmath64 , or reynolds number of the blood flow becomes equal to the reciprocal of the blood prandtl number , @xmath65 . in that region ,",
    "the diffusive heat flow becomes more important than the advective heat transfer .",
    "using known blood flow characteristics ( numbers are taken from @xcite and it s citations ) and values of thermal properties of animal tissues from @xcite , we can roughly classify the model regions according to the pclet number of the blood flow ( see table [ tab : peklet_numbers ] , where the prandtl number of the blood @xmath66 is used , see ) .",
    ".pclet numbers [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for terrestrial animals the assumption of high body conductivity seems to be valid due to very low heat capacity and the thermal conductivity of the air , but for aquatic animals it s validity can be arguable .    the model proposed in this article does not require such assumptions regarding thermal properties of the animal s body .",
    "it uses different assumptions ( see above ) , where one of the most important constraints is requirement of slow changes in the environment to enable the shell to stay in a steady state .",
    "if this assumption is valid , the model embodies newton s cooling as a special case ( see equations  ( [ eq : shell_simple_ja_linear ]  [ eq : shell_tau_est ] ) ) . in the model s framework",
    ", the newton s cooling law can be interpreted as an empirical description of transient processes between different steady states of the shell .",
    "for example , if the temperature of the environment is lowered then the skin surface temperature follows it according newton s law of cooling with apparent characteristic time given by equation .",
    "the same is true if a transition process has been initiated by the core ( change in heat flow because of metabolism rate variation ) .",
    "for example , if the animal ceases an activity ( i.e. lowers the metabolism rate ) , the skin surface cools according to newton s law .",
    "when the shell is in a steady state , the newton s law of cooling may not always be an adequate mechanism if one wants to correlate core temperature , skin temperature , and temperature of the ambience using measured or estimated thermal properties of the body and the media .",
    "the major claim of the model is the hypothesis concerning the role of blood flow in thermoregulation of animals .",
    "it is absolutely clear that thermoregulation in not a primary purpose of the blood , and that the temperature regulation is not a top priority task of the blood flow control system .",
    "the blood flow velocity lies inside a specific range , and this range fits the primary purposes of the blood system . from the point of view of thermoregulation , this is a limitation : @xmath67 indeed , if @xmath68 already , but @xmath69 continues to increase ( permanent cooling of the ambience ) then it can not continue to be compensated for . a similar problem rises at the high limit of the flow velocity range @xmath70 , as can be explained by the following regulation equation : @xmath71    control mechanics may not be perfect , and",
    "if the flow velocity is set too low ( at low ambient temperature ) then the shell may suffer from frost blight .",
    "a high temperature of the ambience and corresponding high flow velocity may cause abnormal pressure in vessels exceeding their breaking point , thus haemorrhages may occur in the shell .",
    "there are researches which demonstrate that vasculature could be built in a sophisticated way to relax these limitations .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "another limitation of the regulation is connected to the maximum shell throughput ( see   and  ): @xmath72 this relation demonstrates that the heat flow from the core can not be set arbitrarily high , and that the upper limit depends on the difference between core temperature and temperature of the environment : the lower the difference then the lower the maximum acceptable value of the heat flow @xmath73 , see equation   for more details about @xmath74 .",
    "some signs of this limitation can be found in @xcite in the data related to the areas with highest measured heat flow .",
    "this limitation is especially important if an ambient temperature is high . at high temperature and high metabolism rate ( when high @xmath75 is required ) ,",
    "the shell may saturate the heat flow , and the core will be forced to use additional mechanisms of the thermoregulation if possible , and/or lower the metabolism rate .",
    "for example , cease chasing the prey and start panting . this `` heat sink bottleneck '' problem may give additional explanation to some effects that can be observed during work or exercise in hot environments , see @xcite .    equation",
    "means that for every @xmath75 , or , equivalently , for every metabolism rate , there is a maximum of tolerable ( operational ) temperature of the environment .",
    "note that it is better to speak about the heat flows , instead of the temperatures , because this limitation depends on thermal properties of both the body and the media , and upper limit of the temperature in air may differ from the limit in water @xcite .",
    "most , if not all , of the regulation mechanics and corresponding limitations depend on thermal properties of body tissues , and some depend on body dimensions .",
    "the thermal properties ( @xmath51 , @xmath76 , @xmath44 ) form `` hard '' limitations .",
    "one can hardly expect significant change in heat capacity , thermal conductivity , or density of the body in a reasonable time that is necessary for the proper thermoregulation .",
    "other properties are more flexible : for instance , @xmath77 , which defines `` insulation '' of the body surface can be cleverly engineered using fur , feathers , behavioural patterns ( i.e. staying in shade to reduce radiation heating , walking to the wind during a hot day to increase forced convection , etc ) .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "comprehensive investigation of animal adaptation to cold and hot environments in regard to metabolism rate , body temperature , and temperature of the ambience can be found in @xcite . from the proposed model s point of view",
    ", the adaptation can be done in some additional ways explained below .",
    "as the regulation equation says , the `` initial '' value of the temperature gradient @xmath69 can be chosen as appropriate for the expected temperature range of the environment .",
    "thus , in cold climate , where low @xmath78 is quite probable , lower value of the gradient allows the blood flow velocity to be set at a higher level , preventing frost blight .",
    "it can be achieved by increasing subcutaneous thickness ( e.g. using thicker layer of fat ) to limit the steepness of the temperature change , and/or by increasing skin thickness , which , according to the equation  , results in raising of the inner temperature of the skin . in a cold climate ,",
    "thick skin and subcutaneous tissues allow high level of metabolism rate and high blood circulation rate without unnecessary heat loss .",
    "evidence of the vascular control s role in body temperature regulation in cold climate can be found in @xcite .    in a hot climate with a high probability of high ambience temperature ,",
    "this approach should be reversed : higher @xmath69 leaves more freedom in blood flow regulation .",
    "thinner skin avoids the `` heat flow saturation '' , as can be seen from the equation  . in a hot climate",
    "the thin skin and subcutaneous tissues are beneficial if high level of metabolism rate is required .",
    "these adaptation and regulation mechanisms do not include those related to the core temperature choice , metabolism rate regulation , or mechanisms that are important when the ambient temperature is far outside of the thermo neutral zone of the animal , which are not considered in this article and are beyond the scope of the proposed model .",
    "homoeothermal animals differ from any other creatures ( either animals , or plants , or fungi ) with their ability to maintain the inner temperature of the organism .",
    "this ability is absolutely crucial from the point of view of an implementation of a feasible model of the thermoregulation of a being .",
    "endothermic animals have a core that permanently generates heat energy because of metabolism .",
    "thus , a model of thermoregulation must include a heat production and a heat discharge with ways for the latter to be optimal ; this forces a researcher to take into consideration an entropy production and entropy discharge , beside the heat production modelling .",
    "the model described above implies a homogeneity of a core ; that is supposed to remain in a ( quasi)equilib - rium : there are no inner heat flows , or entropy flows . from a biological point of view ,",
    "such species are the _ _ homoeotherms__. alternatively , some species are known for a significant variation of the temperature of the compartments of the body ; such animals are called _",
    "the core temperature ( @xmath15 ) of homoeotherms should be constant for optimal performance of enzymes regulating core biochemistry .",
    "it holds true for heterotherms also with slight modification to _",
    "mostly constant_.    according the the first law of thermodynamics this requirement leads to the need of a heat flow ( @xmath75 ) that dissipates excessive power to the external environment .",
    "the power that should be dissipated is proportional to the current metabolism rate value .",
    "constant @xmath15 requirement implies constant @xmath75 with a power that is appropriate for the given metabolism rate .",
    "if the core were directly exposed to the environment it would be strongly driven by ambient temperature ( as well as other thermal parameters ) fluctuations but would not possess enough regulation options .",
    "that is why the shell always exists , both in the model and in reality .",
    "thermodynamic parameters regulation means variable material properties ( heat capacity , thermal conductivity , density , etc ) .",
    "it leads to obvious difficulties if an immediate response to significant ambience variation is required .    under the first law",
    ", some work may be involved to control heat gain or loss ( @xmath79 ) , but this may fail to meet other constraints that are not related to the thermal balance . for example , variable volume may involve use of some thin elastic constructions that may not provide serious mechanical protection .    simultaneously , a notable mass exchange ( @xmath80 ) may not provide a solution of the problem : both mass and composition of the core of any creature are usually permanent .",
    "this conservation of course is not absolute : food / water consumption , growth , etc .",
    "make some slight variations to those figures .",
    "yet , the variations are too small to be effective for quick responding to a temperature change .",
    "these two issues result in a shell implementation , with no ambiguity .",
    "the shell acts as a heat buffer that reduces variations of thermal parameters of the environment as they are experienced by the core .",
    "when ambience warms up , the shell absorbs the excess head coming from the body ( shell entropy increases ) .",
    "reciprocally , when the ambience cools down the shell radiates some heat ( shell entropy decreases ) removing the burden of regulation from the core .",
    "the shell is integral part of the body , so the implementation of the mechanisms for heat exchange between the shell and the core seems to be rather simple .",
    "because the shell temperature ( @xmath81 ) is set up `` automagically '' by the second law of thermodynamics and is not controlled by the core , it is much easier to achieve other `` design goals '' ( e.g. mechanical protection ) , because the constraints to the thermal parameters of the skin may be relaxed ( compared to the constraints in the case of the directly connected core ) .",
    "all mechanics described in this article can work locally .",
    "it means , that it is possible to set @xmath15 and @xmath75 as it is optimal locally , and the shell will find a steady state as is appropriate for the given @xmath78 ( more strictly , for a given local @xmath82 ) .",
    "this means that shell temperature is not required to be homogeneous over the entire surface of the animal .",
    "the model presented here is basically aimed at describing the processes of a temperature regulation for homoeothermic animals : it implies a linear approximation of some processes , a significant difference between an organism and an ambience .",
    "thus , it hardly could be extended for the poikilothermic species , or plants , immediately .",
    "nonetheless , there could be developed versions of the model for these types of organisms , while the discussion of this issue falls beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there are no plant or fungi species that possess maintenance of permanent body temperature ; nor invertebrates .",
    "fishes , amphibians and reptiles are all poikilothermic ones .",
    "surprisingly , there is a single species among mammalians ( the naked mole rat _ heterocephalus glaber _ ) that is a poikilothermic species .",
    "it has a number of specific peculiarities that seem to be quite incompatible to the poikilothermism : very complex social structure of family , very strong stability against a thermal or a chemical burn , etc .",
    "all these features are to be hypothesized to get a relation to its poikilothermism .",
    "poikilothermic species are much more endangered by overheating , in comparison to the homoeothermal animals . since they are seriously restricted in the redistribution of their inner energy fluxes in a manner to switch on the ( active ) mechanisms of an excessive heat discharge .",
    "thus , the model described above must adjust to take into consideration very fine differences in the temperatures of the core and the ambience ; this point seems to be rather technical , but a lot of biological issues are expected to stand behind .",
    "an extension of the model for plant and/or fungi still requires many specific issues to be taken into consideration .",
    "all mammalians exhibit a two - phase day activity pattern : a sleep and an activity , itself .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the metabolism levels in the active state , and in the sleep state differ significantly .",
    "one might say that the sleep metabolism is pretty close to a ( comfort ) minimal one : a number of ( regular ) physiological functions ( e.g. , urine production in kidneys , muscle work , etc . ) are `` around zero '' level . certainly , a heart , and breathing muscles still continue to work , thus sustaining the comfortable minimum level mentioned above .",
    "thus , one needs to develop two basically different models of thermal regulation : the former valid during an active period of the day , and the latter valid for the sleep .",
    "this brings a researcher to an idea of the implementation of the combined model that is able to describe ( and predict ) the switching of the essential thermal regulatory mechanisms during transition between these two states of the organism .",
    "a number of species exhibit another type of two - phase activity pattern , called hibernation and/or torpor .",
    "they differ , actually , from the biological point of view ; meanwhile , we shall discuss them as an entity , with no differentiation .",
    "a torpor differs from the diurnal activity pattern in the figures of the typical temperature , and the metabolic activity exhibited by organisms .",
    "in fact , a hibernation is accompanied by a significant ( up to ten grades ) body temperature decrease , with reciprocal shut down of a metabolism .",
    "usually , hibernation and torpor are strongly correlated with the seasonal activity of a species ; a number of rodents act in this way .",
    "such a life pattern is rather wide spread , and is not restricted only to rodents .    from the technical point of view , a model that combines both",
    "the model described above , and another model that is valid in the torpor state , may look similar to the model described in section  [ diur_r ] .",
    "essentially , it would differ rather strongly , because the day rhythm metabolism variations and the torpor metabolism variations have drastically different biological natures .",
