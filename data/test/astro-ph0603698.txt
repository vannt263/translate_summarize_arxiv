    "7  ( hereafter 7 ) was detected as a variable source by the observatory with a maximum luminosity in the 0.154.5  kev band ( assuming an absorption column of @xmath4 @xmath5 ) that exceeds @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the source stayed active in all following observations .",
    "its variability was explained by an eclipsing x - ray binary ( xrb ) with an orbital period of 1.7  d and an eclipse duration of @xmath80.4  d @xcite .",

    "dcl99 described the shape of the eclipse by a slow ingress ( @xmath9 ) , an eclipse duration of @xmath10 and a fast eclipse egress ( @xmath11 ) with an ephemeris for the mid - eclipse time of hjd  2448631.5@xmath120.1 + n@xmath13(3.4535@xmath120.0005 ) .",
    "dcl99 also report 3@xmath14 evidence for a 0.31  s pulse period .",
    "they come to that conclusion by splitting pspc and hri data of 500  s intervals of continuous data where 7  was positively detected and calculating the summed rayleigh power spectrum .",
    "the linearly binned power spectrum showed an significant excess ( at 99.9 per cent confidence ) at the proposed period when compared to simulated data assuming a poisson distribution with the 7  mean flux .",
    "the signal is broader than what would be expected from a simple sinusoidal pulse .",
    "it was not possible to check if the variability is coherent .",
    "dcl99 conclude ",
    "although pulsed emission seems a reasonable assumption , the power excess could arise from variability of a different nature ( e.g. broad - band variability increasing the chance of spurious detection ) .",
    "\" the orbital period , pulse period and observed x - ray luminosity are remarkably similar to those of the small magellanic cloud neutron star xrb .",

    "the observations cover a large part of the 3.45 d orbital period , however not eclipse in- and egress .",
    "pmm2004 detected emission of 7  during eclipse and a soft x - ray spectrum of the source out - of eclipse that can best be described by bremsstrahlung or disk blackbody models .",
    "no significant regular pulsations of the source in the range 0.251000  s were found .",
    "the average source luminosity out of eclipse was 5@xmath15 ( 0.54.5  kev , corrected for galactic foreground absorption ) . in a special analysis of direct observations",
    "pmm2004 identified as the optical counterpart a b0i to o7i star of 18.89 mag in v which shows the ellipsoidal light curve of a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) with the 7  binary period .",
    "based on the location of the x - ray eclipse and the optical minima , pmm2004 derived an improved binary ephemeris and argued that the compact object in the system is a black hole .",
    "those authors reached this conclusion based on the mass of the compact object derived from orbital parameters and the optical companion mass , the lack of pulsations , and the x - ray spectrum .",
    "7  would be the first detected eclipsing high mass black hole xrb .",
    "the  acis - i survey of 33  ( chasem33 ) is a very large program which will accumulate in seven deep pointings , each 200 ks in length , a total exposure of 1.4  ms . during several of these pointings 7",

    "we report here on chasem33 observations of 7  spread over just 20 binary orbits , which resolved for the first time the eclipse ingress and egress and allowed us to constrain the light curve of 7  for binary phases around eclipse .",

    "the field 5 position of 7  is located close enough to the optical axis to result in significant pile - up , particularly during the high phase . to correct the light curve for the effects of pile - up , we used the best - fit model for unpiled data from the other pointings ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : spec ] ) , and applied a pileup(phabs(diskbb ) ) model within xspec .",
    "we estimated the pile - up parameters by fitting simultaneously the high state data for obsid 6382 ( insignificant pile - up ) and obsids 7170 and 7171 ( significant pile - up ) .",

    "the resulting reduced @xmath18 of the fit was 0.97 and the corresponding value for @xmath17 was 0.692@xmath19 ( 90% confidence limits ) . using the fitted value for @xmath17 , a correction curve was generated by evaluating the ratio of the xspec `` model predicted rate '' without pile - up ( fr_time=0 ) to the corresponding rate with pile - up ( fr_time=3.2 ) as a function of the model predicted rate ( with pile - up ) .",
    "this ratio was used to correct the observed count rates of obsids 6384 , 7070 , and 7071 for the effects of pile - up .",
    "for the spectral analysis we used standard level 2 event files cleaned for columns with higher background rates than adjacent columns . in the observations of fields 4 and 5 ,",

    "this effect creates spurious periods in period analysis and can reduce the counts in 1000  s integration intervals by varying amounts ( up to more than 30% ) .",
    "therefore , we created new level 2 event files for broad band time variability analysis that did not reject these columns .",

    "obsid 7198 shows dipping behavior well before eclipse with a return to the out - of eclipse intensity level at the end .",
    "obsid 6382 shows a second egress from eclipse which is significantly faster than the one 16 orbits earlier ( obsid 7171 ) .",
    "however , the observation starts during egress and the phase range within eclipse is not covered .",
    "obsid 7226 covers eclipse ingress at the end of the same orbit and again shows strong dipping well before the ingress .",
    "eclipse egress and ingress times are consistent with the times derived above . generally speaking the variability of 7  before eclipse ( phase 0.7 to 0.9 ) seems to be much more pronounced in individual observations than after eclipse ( phase 1.1 to 1.4 ) .",
    "average count rates in eclipse and out of eclipse are 0.003  ct s@xmath7  and 0.15  ct s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this out - of - eclipse count rate varies in different binary orbits by factors of 1.3 and there are residual short term fluctuations that can be described by dips with a similar amplitude and a duration of several 1000  s also outside the pre - eclipse phase .    to search for pulsations we extracted light curves in the 0.55  kev band from the longest observations after eclipse , obsids 6382 and 7170 .",
    "we created power density spectra in the frequency range of 10@xmath20.15  hz and found no significant periodic signal with a 3@xmath14 upper limit of 5.3% for sinusoidal variations .",
    "a power density spectrum derived from obsid 6382 by adding the power spectra from 23 intervals of 3319 s length ( 1024 time bins with the instrument resolution of 3.241 s ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] .",
    "the power spectrum is flat at a value of 2 .",
    "we analyzed energy spectra of 7  for all observations . for obsids 6378 and 7171 ,",
    "times out of eclipse , during ingress and egress , and in eclipse were handled separately . absorbed power - law , bremsstrahlung and disk - blackbody models ( which were found to best represent the  and  spectra analyzed by pmm2004 ) were first fit to the individual spectra .",
    "the power - law fit to the spectrum obtained from obsid 6382 ( which has the highest statistical quality ) yields an unacceptable fit with a reduced @xmath18 of 1.92 while bremsstrahlung and disk - blackbody models result in @xmath23 of 1.45 and 1.32 , respectively .",
    "the derived parameters are consistent within the errors for all spectra including the spectra accumulated during eclipse ingress and egress and during obsid 7198 when the source shows high variability .",
    "therefore , we performed a simultaneous fit with the disk - blackbody model to the spectra of eight out - of - eclipse observations excluding times when the x - ray source was in eclipse and forcing the absorbing column density to be the same for all observations ( this reduces the number of free fit parameters compared to the individual fits ) .",
    "the resulting inner disk temperature was systematically higher ( at @xmath81.3 kev ) for obsids 6384 , 7170 and 7171 : these are the observations which include 7  nearly on - axis .",
    "the most likely reason for the `` harder '' spectra is pile - up and we therefore excluded these three spectra from further analysis .",
    "the fit to the remaining five spectra from obsids 6378 , 6382 , 6386 , 7197 and 7198 shows no significant differences in the inner disk temperature and therefore this parameter was also forced to be the same in the simultaneous fit .",
    "we refit the power - law and bremsstrahlung models for comparison .",
    "the best fit is obtained with the disk - blackbody model yielding a @xmath23 of 1.10 .",
    "the @xmath23 for the best fitting bremsstrahlung and power - law models are 1.16 and 1.44 , respectively .",
    "the derived spectral parameters are similar to the ones reported by pmm2004 : disk - blackbody with inner disk temperature kt = 0.99@xmath120.03  kev and n@xmath24 = ( 0.95@xmath120.10)@xmath25 @xmath5 ; bremsstrahlung with temperature kt = 2.74@xmath120.13  kev and n@xmath24 = ( 2.05@xmath120.12)@xmath25 @xmath5 ; power - law with photon index @xmath26 = 2.38@xmath120.05 and n@xmath24 = ( 3.32@xmath120.17)@xmath25 @xmath5 . the best fit disk - blackbody model is shown in fig .  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the normalization of the disk - blackbody model is given by k = @xmath27(cos @xmath28 ) with the inner disk radius r@xmath29 in km , the source distance d in units of 10 kpc and the disk inclination @xmath28 .",
    "the spectra show variations by a factor of @xmath82 in normalization with k=0.054 for obsid 6378 and relative factors 0.58 , 0.94 , 1.13 and 1.37 for obsids 7198 , 7197 , 6386 and 6382 , respectively .",
    "the n@xmath24 values for the models discussed above clearly indicate absorption within 33  or intrinsic to the source in addition to the galactic value .",
    "absorbed and unabsorbed source fluxes in the 0.310 kev band are in the range ( 5.412.6)@xmath30 and ( 6.214.7)@xmath30 , respectively , based on the best fitting disk - blackbody model .",
    "these fluxes correspond to source luminosities of ( 4.19.6)@xmath15 and ( 4.711.2)@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the n@xmath24 value of the best fitting disk - blackbody model indicates that 7  lies on the near side of 33 as the absorbing column within 33  can be determined to @xmath82.2@xmath25 @xmath5 from a @xmath31 arcsec half power beam width hi map @xcite . from the n@xmath24 value we can compute the expected optical extinction @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 using the standard relations .",

    "the source was closest to on - axis ( 1.58  off - axis ) in the field 5 observations ( see table  [ tbl : obs ] ) .",
    "this results in the most compact psf and thus the most reliable position determination . to refine the absolute astrometry of the field 5 data , we searched the usno - b1.0 and 2mass catalogs for close positional matches with x - ray sources . similarly , to improve the statistics for x - ray centroiding , we worked with a merged dataset for obsids 6384 , 7170 , and 7171 .",
    "we identified 9 candidate optical/2mass objects .",

    "the remaining candidates were @xmath34 off - axis , for a 2mass object ( @xmath8250 counts , 0.55  kev ) which was 7.8  off - axis .",
    "we enhanced the number of candidates for registration by adding two isolated centrally brightened supernova remnants ( snrs ) with good radio positions ( sources 57 and 64 from the list of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assuming that the finite size of snrs  and potential differences in the x - ray versus radio distribution  do not bias the position determination .",
    "we determined the x - ray centroids based on an iterative sigma - clipping algorithm applied to the 0.55  kev x - ray data .",
    "based on an initial position estimate and clipping radius , the standard deviation of the radial distribution is evaluated , and points greater than a given number of standard deviations are rejected .",
    "the iteration of centroiding and rejecting events continues until the centroid converges to within a specified tolerance or for a fixed number of iterations ( 10 ) .",
    "the difference in sky coordinates between the catalog position and the x - ray centroid position was evaluated for each source .",
    "the mean offset was @xmath35 .",
    "the centroid of the 7  source was evaluated in the same way , and the resulting offset was applied to correct the sky position .",
    "finally , the corresponding celestial coordinates were evaluated using the ciao tool dmcoords ; the aspect solution files ( asol1 files ) were used in order to correct the positions using the aspect offsets .",
    "the resulting 7  position is ra@xmath36 with a combined error of 0.5 .",
    "the position is within 2@xmath14 of that given by pmm2004 based on a registration using just one snr .",
    "7  is located along the line of sight to the dense ob association hs 13 @xcite : it was identified by pmm2004 with a specific star within this association , as a result of detection of regular ( ellipsoidal ) variations in b and v at the x - ray period .",

    "since the error in the astrometric solution of images in the hst pipeline is typically @xmath81.52 , we attempted to reduce the positional uncertainty by registering the wfpc2 images to the usno - b1.0 or 2mass frames .",
    "given the small field of view and greatly superior spatial resolution of the wfpc2 images , many sources identified in the usno - b1.0 or 2mass catalogues are resolved into multiple objects , making a unique match between stars in the image and sources in the catalogue difficult .",
    "therefore , we performed our astrometric corrections in two steps , taking advantage of the much larger field of view of the kpno mosaic b image of 33   @xcite .",
    "first , we identified a sample of 25 isolated , bright usno - b1.0 stars within 45 of 7  to compute the shift required to bring the mosaic b image into the usno - b1.0 frame .",
    "the rms positional error of these stars in the corrected mosaic image was unacceptably large ( 085 ) .",

    "the rms positional error of these stars in the corrected mosaic image was 016 .",
    "we then used 10 bright , isolated stars in common between the mosaic b and f439w images ( restraining the selection to the region covered by the wfpc2 ccd in which the 7  counterpart was located ) to compute the shift required .",

    "in contrast to the report by prc89 , 7  count rates during this period do not show increasing flux but the source intensity is compatible with zero during all three intervals . in the next set of observation intervals at around day 2",
    "the source is clearly out of eclipse .",
    "this indicates an eclipse egress between hjd  2444087.840 and hjd  2444088.255 .",

    "[ fig : orb ] , these ephemerides also are consistent with the boundaries determined for the  eclipse egress",
    ". however , they seem to miss the boundaries determined above for the  ipc observation .",

    "the derived orbital decay for 7  is well within the range of values determined for other hmxbs like cen x@xmath203 ( @xmath49 yr@xmath7 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such rapidly decreasing periods in hmxbs are most likely caused by tidal interaction between the compact object and its massive companion .",
    "as the orbit decays the roche lobe will descend into the companion s atmosphere and mass transfer will increase to super - eddington rates over a relatively short time scale . in the end , the compact object is expected to spiral into the envelope of the companion and in this way terminate the high - mass xrb phase of the evolution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hst wfpc2 images clearly resolve the dense ob association hs 13 @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart is located to the north and is one of a pair of stars with similar luminosities : these stars are separated by @xmath80.\"9 . while the suggested counterpart is presumed to be a single source ,",
    "the source to the south is a blend of at least 2 stars ( elongation from sse to nnw ) .",

    "assuming the parameters of the optical light curve by pmm2004 ( sinusoidal fit with 0.033 mag amplitude ) the correction to x - ray eclipse is + 0.066 mag resulting in corrected magnitudes @xmath39 of 18.9 mag , and @xmath40 of 19.0 mag for the optical counterpart to 7 . magnitudes and colours",
    "are very close ( within 0.1 mag ) to values deduced by pmm2004 .",
    "7  is also included in the ubvri photometry of stars in 31  and 33  from the survey of local group galaxies , recently published by @xcite .",
    "they give a position ( registered with the usno b1.0 frame ) of ra@xmath52 , about 03 ese from the position in our registered hst image position ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opt ] ) .",
    "their 7  magnitude and colours ( @xmath53mag , @xmath54mag , @xmath55mag ) coincide with those determined by us within 0.2 mag .",
    "part of the discrepancy may be due to the sampling at different binary phases .",
    "the type and luminosity class of the star can be deduced from the absolute optical magnitude and colour during eclipse when we see the optical surface that is mostly undisturbed by gravitational effects , an expected accretion disk and heating by the x - ray source . to derive the absolute magnitude the measured brightness has to be corrected for the distance ( -25.50  mag for the assumed distance of 795 kpc ) and for interstellar extinction",
    ", the colour has to be corrected for reddening .",
    "these corrections have been estimated from the absorption of the x - ray spectrum in sect .",
    "2.2 . based on the hst",
    "values the companion star should have an absolute @xmath56 of @xmath57 mag and @xmath58 of @xmath59 mag .",
    "this corresponds to a giant star of spectral type o6iii which has a temperature of 39500  k , a radius of 17 @xmath60 and a mass well above 20 @xmath61 ( see appendix e in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      with the new eclipse duration and the better determination of the companion type on the basis of the extinction combined with the colour excess corrections derived from the absorbing column of the x - ray spectrum of 7",
    ", we can significantly improve the mass estimate of the compact object compared to pmm2004 . to do so we correct the b and v light curves given in pmm2004 for extinction and colour excess .",
    "we then model these light curves using the  physics of eclipsing binaries \" program phoebe @xcite built on top of the widely used wd program @xcite . by adjusting the semi - major axis of the binary system we kept the radius of the secondary star at 17@xmath60 .",
    "we also fixed the temperature of the secondary to 39500  k. we then fitted the luminosity of the secondary and the mass ratio of the companions using the light curves in the b and v band simultaneously , assuming different inclination angles .",
    "we derive acceptable fits for inclination angles from 75  to 90 .",
    "angles of 74  and smaller can be excluded as the companion star would overfill its roche lobe .",
    "the derived parameters are given in table  [ tab_fit ] .",
    "the available optical data are not sufficient to discriminate between the allowed inclination angles .",
    "however , we expect that an inclination above 80  is more likely than an inclination in the range 75   80  where the companion nearly fills its roche lobe and unstable mass transfer would be expected based on the x - ray observations . in the case of unstable mass transfer ,",
    "the x - ray emission from 7  would most likely be much more variable on longer time scales than observed in all observations since those with the  observatory .",
    "this implies a mass of the compact object in the system of greater than 9@xmath62 and clearly indicates a black hole as the compact object in the system .    as already discussed in pmm2004 , further arguments for the black hole nature of the compact object in 7  come from the lack of x - ray pulsations , the short term variability and the x - ray spectra .",
    "we discuss each of these properties in turn :    \\(i ) pulsations are clear indicators of a neutron star as the compact object in a hmxb . in the power density spectrum analysis",
    "we did not detect significant periodic signals allowing a black hole as the compact object .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star .",
    "our unsuccessful  periodicity search was limited towards short periods by the acis - i sampling time of 3.2  s. also , with the significantly shorter sampling time of  epic pn of 0.073  s , pmm2004 did not find significant pulsations .",
    "\\(ii ) low accretion rate sources should show a power density spectrum ( pds ) with a broken power law ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . above a luminosity of typically 0.1 of the eddington luminosity ,",
    "the pds should be flat .",
    "the short term fluctuations seen in the power spectral analysis of 7  are very small as one would expect for such a high accretion rate source .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of 7  in the 0.310  kev band of @xmath631.1@xmath64 in maximum is consistent with a stellar mass black hole , but it does not constrain the mass .",
    "\\(iii ) hmxbs with a neutron star as the compact object normally show power law spectra ( photon index 0.81.5 ) with a high - energy cutoff around 1020 kev ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "disk - blackbody spectra , on the other hand , suggest emission that is dominated by the inner accretion disk of a low mass xrb system , or  in case of a hmxb  the presence of an accretion disk surrounding a black hole emitting in the high state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned before , the variability of 7  outside eclipse most likely is caused by partial covering of the x - ray emission region due to material in the accretion stream or in the outer accretion disk .",
    "if we assume that during the brightest phase , the 7   disk - blackbody normalization corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit with radius @xmath65 around a black hole , i.e. ( with @xmath66 the schwarzschild radius ) , we obtain @xmath67 .",
    "all of these results of the new  observations suggest that 7   is the first known eclipsing hmxb with a black hole as the compact object .",
    "@xcite advanced the idea of searching for eclipses in ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) to determine black hole masses and  most importantly  to separate intermediate mass from stellar mass black holes as the compact object in this exceptional class of x - ray sources .",
    "they proposed to compare the number of eclipses in the different kind of systems and predicted that more eclipses by far should be detected in stellar mass systems than in intermediate mass black hole systems.the orbital periods and other system parameters would provide considerable insight as to the nature of the binary . while m33 x-7 is about a factor of five less luminous than the commonly accepted lower limit of ulx luminosities , it is still the first eclipsing black hole xrb system and  if in other observations detected in a factor of five brighter phase  may be the first stellar mass ulx candidate suitable for the proposed type of investigations .",
    "as we discussed above , the resolved eclipse ingress and egress in the   energy band is not caused by the extent and the structure of the x - ray emitting region but by absorption in the density structure of the atmosphere of companion and the accretion stream .",
    "@xcite investigated the asymmetry of black - hole accretion flows and suggested the presence of effects with time scales of seconds due to relativistic effects close to the black hole .",
    "these should lead to asymmetries in the eclipsing light curves on time scales of seconds .",
    "the  observations of the eclipse in- and egress of 7  show that such effects are masked by much longer time scale effects discussed above .",
    "they may only be observable by sensitive observations at higher x - ray energies such as those where absorption effects in the companion atmosphere and the accretion flow vanish .",
    "the chasem33 observations clearly resolved eclipse ingress and egress of the persistent eclipsing hmxb 7 . combining the eclipse egress times with , , and  observations allowed us to improve on the orbital period which indicates orbital decay .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can best be described by a disk - blackbody spectrum with parameters that do not change significantly in different observations while the source luminosity changes by up to a factor of two .",
    "the short term variability of 7  can be described by a flat power density spectrum .",
    "no significant regular pulsations were found in the frequency range of 10@xmath20.15  hz .",
    "hst wfpc2 images resolve the optical counterpart , which with the help of extinction and colour corrections derived from the x - ray absorption can be identified as an o6iii star .",
    "the x - ray period and eclipse duration  together with fits to the light curve by pmm2004 of the optical companion  imply a black hole with a mass above @xmath3 as the most likely compact object in the system .",
