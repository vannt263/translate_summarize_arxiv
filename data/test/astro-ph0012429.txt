    "the near - infrared galaxy luminosity function is an important characteristic of the local galaxy population .",
    "it is a much better tracer of evolved stars , and hence of the total stellar content of galaxies , than optical luminosity functions which can be dominated by young stellar populations and are also strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "hence , infrared luminosities can be much more directly related to the underlying stellar mass of galaxies and so knowledge of the present form and evolution of the infrared galaxy luminosity function places strong constraints on the history of star formation in the universe and on galaxy formation models ( cole and references therein ) .",
    "the local k - band luminosity function has been estimated from optically selected samples by mobasher , sharples and ellis ( ) , szokoly ( ) and loveday ( ) and from k - band surveys by glazebrook ( ) , and gardner ( ) .",
    "the existing k - band surveys are small .",
    "the largest , by gardner et al . , covers only 4  deg@xmath12 and contains only 510 galaxies .",
    "the recent survey of loveday covers a much larger solid angle . in this survey",
    "the redshifts were known in advance of measuring the k - band magnitudes and this was exploited by targetting bright and faint galaxies resulting in an effective sample size much larger than the 345 galaxies actually measured . however , like all optically selected samples , it suffers from the potential problem that galaxies with extremely red infrared to optical colours could be missed . in this paper we combine the 2-micron all sky survey ( ) with the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( ) to create an infrared selected redshift survey subtending  deg@xmath12 .",
    "currently the sky coverage of both surveys is incomplete , but already the overlap has an effective area of  deg@xmath12 . within this area",
    "the redshift survey is complete to the magnitude limit of the catalogue and so constitutes a complete survey which is 50  times larger than the previous largest published infrared selected redshift survey .",
    "a new catalogue of a similarly large area , also based on , has very recently been analysed by kochanek ( ) .",
    "they adopt isophotal rather than total magnitudes and concentrate on the dependence of the luminosity function on galaxy morphology .    in section  [ sec :",
    "selection ] we briefly describe the relevant properties of the  and  catalogues .",
    "section  [ sec : matching ] is a detailed examination of the degree to which the matched ",
    "galaxies are a complete and representative subset of the  catalogue .",
    "section  [ sec : mags ] examines the calibration of the  total magnitudes and section  [ sec : compl ] demonstrates that the  catalogue and the inferred luminosity functions are not affected by surface brightness selection effects . in section  [ sec : pop ] we present the method by which we compute k - corrections and evolutionary corrections and relate the observed luminosities to the underlying stellar mass .",
    "the estimation methods and normalization of the luminosity functions are described briefly in section  [ sec : lf_est ] .",
    "our main results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "these include estimates of the j and ( k - short ) luminosity functions , the @xmath9  and j@xmath9  colour distributions as a function of absolute magnitude and the distribution of spectral type .",
    "we also estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies , which can be integrated to infer the fraction of baryons in the universe which are in the form of stars .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the data that we analyze are the extended source catalogue from the second incremental release of the 2-micron all sky survey ( http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu ) and the galaxy catalogue of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (  http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs ) . here",

    "details of how extended sources are identified and their photometric properties measured are given by jarrett ( ) . the detection sensitivity ( 10@xmath13 ) for extended sources is quoted as 14.7 , 13.9 and 13.1 magnitudes in j , h and  respectively .",
    "the complete survey is expected to contain 1  million galaxies of which approximately 580,000 are contained in the second incremental data release made public in march 2000 .",
    "the  is selected in the photographic  band from the apm galaxy survey ( @xcite , , ) and subsequent extensions to it , that include a region in the northern galactic cap ( maddox in preparation ) .",
    "the survey covers approximately  deg@xmath12 consisting of two broad declination strips .",
    "the larger is centred on the sgp and approximately covers @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath15@xmath17 , @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath19@xmath21 ; the smaller strip is in the northern galactic cap and covers @xmath22@xmath15@xmath16@xmath15@xmath23 , @xmath24@xmath19@xmath20@xmath19@xmath25 .",
    "in addition , there are a number of randomly located circular 2-degree fields scattered across the full extent of the low extinction regions of the southern apm galaxy survey .",
    "there are some gaps in the  sky coverage within these boundaries due to small regions that have been excluded around bright stars and satellite trails .",
    "the  aims to measure the redshifts of all the galaxies within these boundaries with extinction - corrected  magnitudes brighter than 19.45 .",
    "when complete , at the end of 2001 , 250,000 galaxy redshifts will have been measured . in this paper",
    "we use the  redshifts obtained prior to .",
    "the overlap of the two surveys is very good .",

    "the astrometry in both  and  is , in general , very good and it is an easy matter to match objects in the two catalogues . we choose to find the closest pairs within a search radius equal to three quarters of the semi - major axis of the j - band image ( denoted j_r_e in the  database ) . scaling the search radius in this way helps with the matching of large extended objects .",
    "this procedure results in the identification of  counterparts for  of the  objects , when at random one would only expect to find a handful of such close pairs .",
    "moreover , the distribution of separations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seps ] peaks at 0.5  arcsec , with only 3% having separations greater than 3  arcsec .",
    "a significant part of this tail comes from the most extended objects as is evident from the dotted histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : seps ] which shows objects with semi - major axes larger than 12  arcsec .",
    "thus , we can be very confident in these identifications .",

    "the remaining % are missed for well understood reasons ( star - galaxy classification : % ; merged or close images : % ; miscellaneous : % ) , none of which ought to introduce a bias .",
    "this is confirmed explicitly , in the middle row of fig .  [",
    "fig : hists ] , by the close correspondence between the photometric properties of the missed % and those of the larger matched sample .",
    "hence , in estimating luminosity functions no significant bias will be introduced by assuming the matched sample to be representative of the full population .",
    "furthermore , the distribution shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : hists ] shows that the subset of galaxies for which we have measured redshifts is a random sample of the full matched   catalogue .",
    "this summary is the result of a thorough investigation , which we describe in the remainder of this section , into the reasons why % of the  sources are missed and whether their omission introduces a bias in the properties of the matched sample .",
    "= 15.0 truecm    we first consider objects in the  catalogue which based on their images and colours are not confidently classified as galaxies . in the  database a high e_score or g_score indicates a high probability that the object is either not an extended source or not a galaxy .",
    "a cc_flag@xmath280 indicates an artifact or contaminated and/or confused source .",

    "rejecting all objects which have either e_score@xmath151.4 , g_score@xmath151.4 or cc_flag@xmath280 removes just % of the total .",
    "however , removing these reduces significantly the fraction of the sample that does not match with the  catalogue , from % to % .",
    "thus , it is likely that about 30% of the  objects which have e_score@xmath151.4 , g_score@xmath151.4 or cc_flag@xmath280 are not galaxies .",

    "[ fig : hists ] we compare the distributions of magnitude , colour and surface brightness for the matched and missed  objects . in general , the properties of the missed subset overlap well with those of the much larger matched subset .",
    "however , we do see that the distributions for missed objects contain tails of bright and blue objects .",
    "it is quite likely that this is due to the  extended source catalogue being contaminated by a small population of saturated or multiple stars .",

    "[ fig : hists ] show the distributions of magnitude , colour and surface brightness for the bright subset of the missed objects with j@xmath1912 . here",
    "we clearly see bimodal colour and surface brightness distributions .",
    "the blue peak of the colour distribution is consistent with that expected for stars ( see jarrett ) .",
    "excluding these bright , j@xmath1912 , objects which are clearly contaminated by stars reduces the fraction of missed  objects from % to % .",
    "the magnitude , colour and surface brightness distributions for this remaining % are shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hists ] .",
    "we see that the missed objects are slightly under - represented at the faintest magnitudes and also slightly bluer on average than the matched sample , while the distribution of surface brightness is almost indistinguishable for the two sets of objects .",
    "these differences are small and so will introduce no significant bias in our luminosity function estimates . to elucidate the reasons for the remaining missed % of  objects we downloaded 100 1@xmath291  arcmin images from the stsci digitized sky survey ( dss ) centred on the positions of a random sample of the missed  objects . in each image we plotted a symbol to indicate the position of any  galaxies within the 1@xmath291  arcmin field .",
    "we also plotted symbols to indicate the positions and classifications of all images identified in the apm scans from which the  catalogue was drawn , down to a magnitude limit of @xmath30 .",
    "these images are classified as galaxies , stars , merged images ( galaxy+galaxy , galaxy+star or star+star ) or noise .",
    "this set of plots allows us to perform a census of the reasons why some  objects are not present in the  survey .",
    "= 8.5 truecm    the main cause for the absence of objects in the  is that the apm has classified these objects as stars .",
    "these amount to % of the missed sample ( % of the full  sample ) . in some cases ,",
    "the dss image shows clearly that these are stars and in others that they are galaxies .",
    "however , the majority of these objects can not easily be classified from the dss images .",
    "thus , they could be galaxies that the apm has falsely classified as stars or stars that  has falsely classified as galaxies .",
    "the first possibility is not unexpected since the parameters used in the apm star - galaxy separation algorithm were chosen as a compromise between high completeness and low contamination such that the expected completeness is around 95% with 5% stellar contamination ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is hard to rule out the possibility that this class of object does not include a substantial fraction of stars , but if so , their presence appears not to distort the distribution of colours shown in fig  [ fig : colours ] .",
    "another % of the random sample ( % of the full  sample ) are classified by the apm as mergers or else consist of two close images in the dss but are classified by the apm as a single galaxy offset from the  position .",
    "the remaining % of the random sample ( % of the full  sample ) are missed for a variety of reasons including proximity to the diffraction spikes of very bright stars and poor astrometry caused by the presence of a neighbouring unclassified image .",
    "= 9.0 truecm    = 18.0 truecm    the  extended source database provides a large selection of different magnitude measurements . in the previous section we used the default magnitudes ( denoted j_m and k_m in the database )",
    "these are magnitudes defined within the same circular aperture in each waveband . for galaxies brighter than @xmath26@xmath31 ,",
    "the aperture is the circular -band isophote of 20  mag arcsec@xmath32 and for galaxies fainter than @xmath2614 it is the circular j - band isophote of 21  mag arcsec@xmath32 .",
    "these are not the most useful definitions of magnitude for determining the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "since we are interested in measuring the total luminosity and ultimately the total stellar mass of each galaxy , we require a magnitude definition that better represents the total flux emitted by each galaxy .",
    "we consider kron magnitudes ( kron ) and extrapolated magnitudes .",
    "kron magnitudes ( denoted j_m_e and k_m_e in the  database ) are measured within an aperture , the kron radius , defined as 2.5 times the intensity - weighted radius of the image .",
    "the extrapolated magnitudes ( denoted j_m_ext and k_m_ext in the  database ) are defined by first fitting a modified exponential profile , @xmath33 $ ] , to the image from 10  arcsec to the 20  mag / arcsec@xmath12 isophotal radius , and extrapolating this from the kron radius to 4 times this radius or 80  arcsec if this is smaller ( jarrett private communication ) .",
    "note that improvements are being made to the extended source photometry algorithms developed and employed  team and so in the final  data release the definitions of the kron and extrapolated magnitudes may be slightly modified ( jarrett private communication ) .",
    "[ fig : mags ] compares the default , kron and extrapolated magnitudes in the j and  bands for the matched   catalogue .",
    "the upper panel shows that while the median offset between the j - band isophotal default magnitudes and the pseudo - total kron magnitudes is small there is a large spread with some galaxies having default magnitudes more than 0.5  magnitudes fainter than the kron magnitude .",
    "the kron magnitudes are systematically fainter than the extrapolated magnitudes by between approximately 0.1 and 0.3  magnitudes .",
    "this offset is rather larger than expected : if the kron radius is computed using a faint isophote to define the extent of the image from which the intensity weighted radius is measured , then the kron magnitudes should be very close to total .",
    "for an exponential light profile ( @xmath34 ) , the kron radius should capture 96% of the flux , while for an @xmath35 law ( @xmath36 ) , 90% of the flux should be enclosed . in other words ,",
    "the kron magnitude should differ from the total magnitude by only 0.044 and 0.11  magnitudes in these two cases .",
    "however , the choice of isophote is a compromise between depth and statistical robustness . in the case of the  second incremental release , an isophote of 21.7(20.0 )  mag arcsec@xmath32 in j ( )",
    "was adopted ( jarrett private communication ) .",
    "these relatively bright isophotes , particularly the -band isophote , could lead to underestimates of the kron radii and fluxes for lower surface brightness objects and plausibly accounts for much of the median offset of 0.3  magnitudes seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mags ] between the -band kron and extrapolated magnitudes .",
    "this line of reasoning favours adopting the extrapolated magnitudes as the best estimate of the total magnitudes , but , on the other hand , the extrapolated magnitudes are model - dependent and have larger measurement errors .    to understand better the offset and scatter in the magnitudes",
    "we have compared a subset of the  data with the independent k - band photometry of loveday ( 2000 ) .",
    "the pointed observations of loveday have better resolution than the 2mass images and good signal - to - noise to a much deeper isophote .",
    "this enables accurate , unbiased kron magnitudes to be measured .",
    "note that the offset between the  -band and the standard k - band used by loveday is expected to be almost completely negligible ( see carpenter ) .",
    "the left hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : loveday ] compare these measurements with the corresponding  kron and extrapolated magnitudes .",
    "the right hand panels show -band kron and extrapolated magnitudes computed by taking the  j - band kron and extrapolated magnitudes and subtracting the j@xmath9  colour measured within the default aperture .",
    "these indirect estimates are interesting to consider as they combine the profile information from the deeper j - band image with the j@xmath9colour measured within the largest aperture in which there is good signal - to - noise .",

    "the rms of these residuals and a bootstrap error estimate is also given in each panel .",
    "from these comparisons we first see that all the fits have slopes entirely consistent with unity , but that their zeropoints and scatters vary .",

    "magnitudes the offset is @xmath38  magnitudes . in the case of the kron magnitudes inferred from the deeper j - band image profiles , the offset is reduced to @xmath39  magnitudes . conversely the  extrapolated magnitudes are systematically brighter than the loveday kron magnitudes by @xmath40 and  @xmath41  magnitudes , where one would expect an offset of only @xmath42 to @xmath43 due to the difference in definition between ideal kron and true total magnitudes . for both estimates of the extrapolated magnitude and for the directly estimated kron magnitude",
    "the scatter about the correlation is approximately 0.14  magnitudes and we note a slight tendency for the scatter to increase at faint magnitudes . the magnitude estimate that best correlates with the loveday measurements is the kron magnitude estimated from the  j - band kron magnitude and the default aperture j@xmath9  colour . here",
    "the distribution of residuals has a much reduced scatter of only 0.1  magnitudes and has very few outliers .",
    "our conclusions from the comparison of kron magnitudes is that it is preferable to adopt the -band magnitude inferred from the j - band kron or extrapolated magnitude by converting to the -band using default aperture colour , rather than to use the noisier and more biased direct -band estimates . with this definition , we find that the  kron magnitudes slightly underestimate the galaxy luminosities while the extrapolated magnitudes slightly overestimate the luminosities , particularly at faint fluxes",
    ". we will present results for both magnitude definitions , but we note that to convert to total magnitudes we estimate that the  kron magnitudes should be brightened by @xmath44@xmath45 magnitudes and the extrapolated magnitudes dimmed by @xmath46@xmath43 magnitudes .      here",
    "we define the magnitude limited samples which we will analyze in section  [ sec : lf_est ] and test them for possible incompleteness in both magnitude and surface brightness . for the kron and extrapolated magnitudes ,",
    "the  catalogue has high completeness to the nominal limits of j@xmath1914.7 and @xmath1913.9 .",
    "however , to ensure very high completeness and avoid any bias in our luminosity function estimates , we made the following more conservative cuts .",
    "for the kron magnitudes , we limited our sample to either j@xmath1914.45 or @xmath1913.2 , and for the extrapolated magnitudes to either j@xmath1914.15 or @xmath1912.9 .",
    "these choices are motivated by plots such as the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mags ] . here",
    "the isophotal default magnitude limit of j@xmath19@xmath47 is responsible for the right hand edge to the distribution of data points .",

    "it also cautions that the mean @xmath59@xmath15@xmath60 can not necessarily be taken as a sign of evolution or a local underdensity , but may instead be related to the accuracy of the magnitude measurements .",

    "the k and e - corrections at these wavelengths are both small and uncertainties in them have little effect on the estimated luminosity functions .",
    "this is because these infrared bands are not dominated by young stars and also because the  survey does not probe a large range of redshift .",
    "we have chosen to derive individual k and e - corrections for each galaxy using the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( ) . we have taken this approach not because such detailed modelling is necessary to derive robust luminosity functions , but because it enables us to explore the uncertainties in the derived galaxy stellar mass functions , which are , in fact , dominated by uncertainties in the properties of the stellar populations .",
    "the latest models of bruzual & charlot ( ) provide , for a variety of different stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , @xmath74 , of a single population of stars formed at the same time with a single metallicity , as a function of both age , @xmath75 , and metallicity , @xmath76 . we convolve these with an assumed star formation history , @xmath77 , to compute the time - evolving sed of the model galaxy ,",
    "@xmath78 we take account of the effect of dust extinction on the seds using the ferrara ( ) extinction model normalized so that the v - band central face - on optical depth of the milk - way is 10 .",
    "this value corresponds to the mean optical depth of @xmath79 galaxies in the model of cole ( ) which employs the same model of dust extinction .",
    "we assume a typical inclination angle of 60 degrees which yields a net attenuation factor of 0.53 in the v - band and 0.78 in the j - band . by varying the assumed metallicity , @xmath76 , and star formation history ,",
    "we build up a two - dimensional grid of models .",
    "then , for each of these models , we extract tracks of @xmath9  and j@xmath9  colours and stellar mass - to - light ratio as a function of redshift .",
    "our standard set of tracks assumes a cosmological model with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , hubble constant @xmath80 km s@xmath81 mpc@xmath81 , and star formation histories with an exponential form , @xmath82/\\tau)$ ] . here ,",
    "@xmath83 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath54 and the galaxy is assumed to start forming stars at @xmath84 .",
    "for these tracks , we adopt the kennicutt imf ( @xcite ) and include the dust extinction model .",
    "the individual tracks are labelled by a metallicity , @xmath76 , which varies from @xmath85 to @xmath86 and a star formation timescale , @xmath87 , which varies from @xmath88 gyr to @xmath89 gyr .",
    "examples of these tracks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] , along with the observed redshifts and colours of the  galaxies .",
    "we can see that the infrared j@xmath9  colour depends mainly on metallicity while the @xmath9  colour depends both on metallicity and star formation timescale .",
    "thus , the use of both colours allows a unique track to be selected .",
    "note from the bottom panel that , for all the tracks , the k+e correction is always small for the range of redshift spanned by our data .",
    "we can gauge how robust our results are by varying the assumptions of our model . in particular , we vary the imf , the dust extinction and cosmological models , and include or exclude the evolutionary contribution to the k+e correction . also , we consider power - law star formation histories , @xmath90^{-\\gamma}$ ] , as an alternative to the exponential model .",
    "the results are discussed at beginning of section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the procedure for computing the individual galaxy k+e corrections is straightforward . at the measured redshift of a galaxy",
    ", we find the model whose @xmath9  and j@xmath9  colours most closely match that of the observed galaxy .",
    "having selected the model we then follow it to @xmath62 to predict the galaxy s present - day j and -band luminosities and also its total stellar mass .",
    "we also use the model track to follow its k+e correction to higher redshift in order to compute @xmath56 , the maximum redshift at which this galaxy would have passed the selection criteria for inclusion into the analysis sample .",
    "we use both the simple @xmath73 method and standard maximum likelihood methods to estimate luminosity functions .",
    "we present schechter function fits computed using the sty method ( sandage , tammann & yahil ) and also non - parametric estimates using the stepwise maximum likelihood method ( swml ) of efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( ) .",
    "our implementation of each of these methods is described and tested in norberg ( ) .",
    "the advantage of the maximum likelihood methods is that they are not affected by galaxy clustering ( provided that the galaxy luminosity function is independent of galaxy density ) .",
    "by contrast the @xmath73 method , which makes no assumption about the dependence of the luminosity function with density , is subject to biases produced by density fluctuations .",
    "the two maximum likelihood methods determine the shape of the luminosity function , but not its overall normalization .",
    "we have chosen to normalize the luminosity functions by matching the galaxy number counts of jarrett ( in preparation ) .",
    "these were obtained from a 184  deg@xmath12 area selected to have low stellar density and in which all the galaxy classifications have all been confirmed by eye .",
    "the counts are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] . by using the same 7  arcsec aperture magnitudes as jarrett ( in preparation ) and scaling the galaxy counts in our redshift survey",
    ", we deduce that the effective area of our redshift catalogue is @xmath91  deg@xmath12 .",
    "note that normalizing in this way by - passes the problem of whether or not some fraction of the missed objects are stars .",
    "[ fig : counts ] also shows the kron and extrapolated magnitude j and  counts of the   redshift survey . in the lower panel , these counts are seen to be in agreement with the published k - band counts of gardner ( ) and glazebrook ( ) .",
    "we also checked the normalization using the following independent estimate of the effective solid angle of the redshift survey .",
    "for galaxies in the  parent catalogue brighter than @xmath92 , we computed the fraction that have both measured redshifts and match a  galaxy . for a faint @xmath93",
    "this fraction is small as the  catalogue is much deeper than the  catalogue , but as @xmath93 is made brighter , the fraction asymptotes to the fraction of the area of the  parent catalogue covered by the joint redshift survey . by this method",
    "we estimate that the effective area of our redshift catalogue is @xmath94  deg@xmath12 , which is in good agreement with the estimate from the counts of jarrett .",
    "it should be noted that for neither of these estimates of the effective survey area do the quoted uncertainties take account of variations in the number counts due to large scale structure . to estimate the expected variation in the galaxy number counts within the combined -  survey due to large scale structure we constructed an ensemble of mock catalogues from the @xmath95cdm hubble volume simulation of the virgo consortium ( evrard ; evrard in preparation ; http://www.physics.lsa.umich.edu/hubble-volume ) .",
    "mock catalogues constructed from the virgo hubble volume simulations ( baugh in preparation ) can be found at http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/@xmath96cole/mocks/hubble.html .",
    "we simply took these catalogues and sampled them to the depth of  over a solid angle of @xmath97  deg@xmath12 .",
    "to this magnitude limit we found an rms variation in the number of galaxies of 15% .",
    "we took this to be a realistic estimate of the uncertainty in the  number counts and propagated this error through when computing the error on the normalization of the luminosity function .",

    "[ fig : madau ] shows observational estimates for one particular choice of cosmology and imf and illustrates how the rates are sensitive to the assumed dust extinction . by fitting a smooth curve through these estimates",
    ", we can calculate the mass of stars formed by the present day and how this depends on the imf and assumed dust extinction . the upper smooth curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : madau ] is of the form @xmath98yr@xmath81mpc@xmath3 , where @xmath99 .",
    "the data points uncorrected for dust extinction are fit with @xmath100 . as for our estimates",
    "above , we assume that no mass goes into forming brown dwarfs and multiply the star formation rate by @xmath101@xmath9@xmath102 , where @xmath102 is the recycled fraction , so as to form an estimate of the mass locked up in stars .",
    "values of @xmath103 estimated in this way are listed in table  [ tab : madau ] .",
    "the values in this table are for an @xmath7 , @xmath8 cosmology , but they are insensitive to this choice .",
    "they depend slightly on the assumed metallicity of the stellar population and would be 10% lower if half solar , rather than solar metallicity were assumed .",
    "note that the @xmath104 values inferred from the star formation history of the universe scale differently with the assumed hubble constant than those inferred above from the ir luminosity functions . for @xmath105 our estimates from   become @xmath106 for the kennicutt imf and @xmath107 for the salpeter imf .",
    "comparison with table  [ tab : madau ] shows that these values are consistent with those inferred from the cosmic star formation history only if the dust correction assumed in the latter is modest , e(b - v)@xmath108 .",
    "this value is 50% smaller than the value preferred by steidel ( ) .",
    "the new generation of very large surveys currently underway make it possible to characterize the galaxy population with unprecedented accuracy . in this paper , we have combined two such large surveys , the infrared imaging 2mass and the 2df galaxy redshift survey and  [ tab : smfswml ] are available at http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/@xmath96cole/2dfgrs-2mass . ] to obtain a complete dataset which is more than an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets used for statistical studies of the near - infrared properties of the local galaxy population .",
    "we have used this combined catalogue to derive the most precise estimates to date of the galaxy j and -band luminosity functions and of the galaxy stellar mass function .    characterizing the near - infrared properties of galaxies",
    "offers several advantages .",
    "firstly , the near - infrared light is dominated by established , old stellar populations rather than by the recent star formation activity that dominates the blue light .",
    "thus , the j and k - band luminosity functions reflect the integrated star formation history of a galaxy and , as a result , provide particularly important diagnostics of the processes of galaxy formation . for the same reason , the distribution of stellar mass in galaxies the galaxy stellar mass function can be derived from the near - infrared luminosities in a relatively straightforward way , with only a weak model dependence .",
    "finally , corrections for dust extinction as well as k - corrections are much smaller in the near - infrared than in the optical .",
    "due to the size of our sample , our determination of the j- and -band galaxy luminosity functions have , for the most part , smaller statistical errors than previous estimates .",
    "furthermore , since our sample is infrared - selected , our estimates are free from any potential biases that might affect infrared luminosity functions derived from optically - selected samples .",
    "we find that the j- and -band galaxy luminosity functions are fairly well described by schechter functions , although there is some evidence for an excess of bright galaxies relative to the best - fit schechter functional form . in general , the swml estimates are a truer representation of the luminosity functions .",
    "our k - band estimates are in overall agreement with most previous determinations , but have smaller statistical errors .",
    "the exception is the k - band luminosity function inferred from the near infrared sdds photometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the k - band luminosity function we infer from their data and our own estimate is too large to be explained by photometric differences .",
    "the difference between the two estimates is better described by a difference in overall number density of a factor of @xmath109 .",
    "a similar discrepancy is seen in the -band between the sdss and luminosity function estimates ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the suspicion is that the uncertainty in the overall normalization of the luminosity functions induced by large - scale structure within the large , but finite , survey volumes could be to blame .",
    "however , the errors that we quote for the -luminosity functions already include an estimate of this sampling uncertainty as derived from realistic mock catalogues . a similar exercise for a catalogue with the same area and depth as that of blanton ( ) indicates that the required overdensity of a factor of @xmath109 is unlikely .",
    "so probably there is more than one contributory factor at work and the hope is that these will be identified as the surveys progress .    using our j - band luminosity function , @xmath9  and j@xmath9  colours and simple galaxy evolutionary tracks",
    ", we have obtained the first estimate of the galactic stellar mass function derived directly from near - infrared data .",
    "we find that this mass function is also fairly well described by a schechter form .",
    "an integral over the stellar mass function gives @xmath104 , the universal mass density locked up in luminous stars and stellar remnants , expressed in terms of the critical density .",
    "@xmath104 is a key component of the overall inventory of baryons in the universe .",
    "an accurate determination of this quantity is essential for detailed comparisons with other quantities of cosmological interest such as the total baryonic mass , @xmath110 , inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis considerations ( e.g. burles & tytler 1998 ) , the cosmic star formation rate ( e.g. steidel ) , and the cosmic evolution of the gas content of the universe ( storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath104 is about 15% , several times smaller than the best previous determination by salucci & persic ( ) . in fact , the errors in @xmath104 are dominated by systematic uncertainties associated with the choice of stellar imf in the galaxy evolution model .",
    "a kennicutt imf gives @xmath111 while a salpeter imf gives @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath105 , these values correspond to less than 11% of the baryonic mass inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "our values of @xmath104 today are only consistent with recent determinations of the integrated cosmic star formation if the correction for dust extinction is modest .",
