    "other studies conclude that the mdf in the bulge can be separated into a metal - rich population of stars that are part of the b / p bulge , and a metal - poor population that traces an old spheroidal component @xcite .",

    "however , there is disagreement on the spatial distribution of the bulge rrls : @xcite find that the rrl distribution is spheroidal with a slight elongation inside 1 kpc , whereas , @xcite find that the spatial distribution of rrls is barred , but that the rrls are not part of the x - shaped structure seen in red clump giant stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the questions that we want to address in this study are : could the metal - poor stars in the bulge be part of the inner stellar halo ?",

    "this could arise , for example in an accretion model for the halo , because the fragments that reached the centre of the mw were chemically somewhat more evolved than those that contributed most of the stars near the sun .",

    "we assume that the metal - poor halo traced by rrls formed early in the history of the mw before the galactic bar was present . at these early times , we model the stellar halo as an oblate component with axial ratios @xmath26 , @xmath27 and a single power - law density profile @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",

    "we use all the dark matter halo particles from model m85 as test particles which now will be representing the stellar halo .",
    "the dark matter particles now have two weights , the first is to calculate the dark matter potential , and the second is the weight that orbits have in the stellar halo .",
    "we determine the stellar halo weights using the made - to - measure method @xcite , such that at @xmath31 they represent our oblate power - law density model for the stellar halo in @xmath35 . then at any later time @xmath36",
    "we can use these same particle weights to determine the properties of the stellar halo in the evolved @xmath30 . note that our initial stellar halo does not rotate , and has a mild radial anisotropy .",
    "now we use the halo particle weights to reconstruct the stellar halo at the final time of the simulation , thereby predicting the shape of its density distribution and the kinematics of the halo stars after several gyr of gravitational interaction with the bar and b / p bulge .",
    "figure [ fig : shape ] shows that during the evolution , the shape of the stellar halo in the inner @xmath37 kpc of the galaxy has changed from the initial oblate distribution with constant axial ratio ( left panels ) to a triaxial distribution ( right panels ) . at the final time , the axial ratios of the triaxial stellar halo both increase with major axis radius , from @xmath38 to @xmath39 in @xmath40 , and from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in @xmath43 .",

    ", the mean rv is approximately zero ( the model does not initially rotate ) , and the velocity dispersion is in the range @xmath47 to @xmath48 km / s , depending on galactic longitude and latitude , @xmath49 . at the final time , the mean rv is @xmath1 km / s at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the dispersion is @xmath3 km / s outside the central few degrees .",
    "the measured rotation in the later stages of the n - body simulation is due to angular momentum transfer mostly during bar formation @xcite .",
    "note that exact values are model - dependent , however , the main point is that the rotation is small compared to that of the b / p bulge .        new kinematic data of the rrls from @xcite show that the rr lyrae stars in the galactic bulge at @xmath52 , @xmath53 exhibit hot kinematics with almost negligible rotation . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : kinematics ] , we present the radial velocity distribution of our model versus their data , showing that although the predicted rotation is @xmath54 km / s smaller , the rv histogram is in good agreement with the observations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the metal - poor stars ( @xmath9<-1.0 $ ] ) in the argos survey rotate faster @xcite than both our halo model and the bulge rrls .",
    "this could be caused by a contamination of the argos metal - poor component with metal - poor thick disk stars , or by a larger initial rotation of the argos metal - poor stars ( as we have checked by suitable models ) , but in any case the metal - poor halo component that we are discussing here must be different from the argos metal - poor stars .",
    "our stellar halo model has a bar shape in the inner galaxy .",
    "however , the rotation of this component is slow compared with stars in the galactic bar and b / p bulge . to understand the kinematic differences between both structures we analyze the halo orbits .",
    "to do so , we use frequency analysis .",
    "first , we compute the fast fourier transform ( fft ) for particle tracks in major axis coordinate @xmath55 and cylindrical radius @xmath56 , in order to identify the respective main frequencies",
    ". then we separate the stellar halo particles into bar - following particles , for which the ratio of @xmath57 , and not - bar - following particles , with @xmath58 .",
    "we are using the same criteria to classify orbits as @xcite .    for a sample of 30000 stellar halo particles within @xmath37 kpc radius ,",
    "we find that just @xmath4 of the halo particles follow the bar and @xmath59 do not . in figure [ fig : orbits ] , we show the surface density and rv maps on the sky for the entire sample , the bar - following particles , and the not - bar - following particles . notice that bar - following particles have faster rotation ( @xmath60 km / s ) than the not - bar - following particles , but also that the relative contribution of the bar - following particles is concentrated in the inner bulge region and is very small elsewhere .",
    "we also see in figure [ fig : orbits ] a counterrotating structure for the not - bar - following particles ( third middle panel ) .",
    "a possible reason for the presence of this structure is that the bar traps prograde orbits more easily than retrograde orbits .",
    "figure [ fig : orbits_xyz ] is similar to figure [ fig : orbits ] but shows @xmath61 and @xmath62 projections rather than @xmath49 . with this figure",
    "we point out that the bar - following particles do not show an x - shaped structure as is observed for stars in the b / p bulge , and that the bar - following orbits dominate only in the inner few degrees where even their rotation is small , and that their contribution elsewhere is also small .",
    "( first row ) , the bar - following particles ( second row ) , and the not - bar - following particles ( third row ; logarithmic scale ) .",

    "we constructed a model for the old stellar halo in the milky way ( mw ) as traced by rr lyrae ( rrl ) stars in order to investigate the origin of the triaxial shape and slow rotation of rrl in the bulge region .",
    "based on observational constraints , we assumed an oblate shape with a single power - law density ( @xmath63 ) at early times . using an n - body simulation for the mw",
    ", we followed the evolution of this stellar halo component until several gyr after formation of the galactic bar and b / p bulge . with this model",
    ", we addressed the effect of the bar and b / p bulge on the mw s inner metal - poor halo , and made predictions for its density distribution and kinematics .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the extrapolated density profile of rrls in the bulge , with power - law index of @xmath64 , approximately agrees with the rrl density profiles in the stellar halo at @xmath12 kpc . * through the gravitational influence of the galactic bar and b / p bulge during their formation and evolution , the shape of the inner stellar halo evolves from oblate to triaxial . *",
    "our model predicts a slow mean radial velocity in approximate agreement with recent measurements at @xmath65 , rising to @xmath1 km / s at @xmath66 , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath3 km / s .",
    "this rotation measured in the later stages of the n - body simulation is due to the angular momentum transfer during the bar evolution . * with frequency analysis we separated the stellar halo particles into bar - following and not - bar - following orbits , and found that bar - following orbits are a minority , @xmath67 of all orbits within @xmath37 kpc .",
    "this is the reason for the slow rotation in our halo model . *",
