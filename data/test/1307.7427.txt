    "torque oscillator ( sto ) has attracted much attention due to its potential uses for a microwave generator and a recording head of a high density hard disk drive .",
    "the self - oscillation of the sto was first discovered in an in - plane magnetized giant - magnetoresistive ( gmr ) system [ 1 ] .",
    "after that , the self - oscillation of the sto has been observed not only in gmr systems [ 2]-[6 ] but also in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) [ 7]-[11 ] .",
    "the different types of sto have been proposed recently ; for example , a point - contact geometry with a confined magnetic domain wall [ 12]-[14 ] which enables us to control the frequency from a few ghz to a hundred ghz .    recently , kubota _ et al . _ experimentally developed the mgo - based mtj consisting of a perpendicularly magnetized free layer and an in - plane magnetized pinned layer [ 15],[16 ] .",
    "they also studied the self - oscillation of this type of mtj , and observed a large power ( @xmath0 @xmath1w ) with a narrow linewidth ( @xmath2 mhz ) [ 17 ] .",
    "these results are great advances in realizing the sto device .",
    "however , the relation between the current and the oscillation frequency still remains unclear . since",
    "a precise control of the oscillation frequency of the sto by the current is necessary for the application , it is important to clarify the relation between the current and the oscillation frequency .    in this paper , we derived the theoretical formula of the relation between the current and the oscillation frequency of the sto consisting of the perpendicularly magnetized free layer and the in - plane magnetized pinned layer .",
    "the derivation is based on the analysis of the energy balance between the work done by the spin torque and the energy dissipation due to the damping .",
    "we found that the oscillation frequency monotonically decreases with increasing the current by keeping the magnetization in one hemisphere of the free layer .",
    "the validity of the analytical solution was confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "we also found that the field - like torque breaks the energy balance , and change the oscillation frequency .",
    "the shift direction of the frequency , high or low , is determined by the sign of the field - like torque .",

    "we denote the unit vectors pointing in the directions of the magnetization of the free and the pinned layers as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "the variable @xmath7 of @xmath8 is the tilted angle from the @xmath6-axis while @xmath9 is the rotation angle from the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the current @xmath10 flows along the @xmath6-axis , where the positive current corresponds to the electron flow from the free layer to the pinned layer .",
    "we assume that the magnetization dynamics is well described by the following llg equation : @xmath11 the gyromagnetic ration and the gilbert damping constant are denoted as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field is defined by @xmath14 , where the energy density @xmath15 is @xmath16 here , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the saturation magnetization , the applied field along the @xmath6-axis , and the crystalline anisotropy field along the @xmath6-axis , respectively .",
    "because we are interested in the perpendicularly magnetized system , the crystalline anisotropy field , @xmath19 , should be larger than the demagnetization field , @xmath20 .",
    "since the llg equation conserves the norm of the magnetization , the magnetization dynamics can be described by a trajectory on an unit sphere .",
    "the equilibrium states of the free layer correspond to @xmath21 . in following",

    "it should be noted that a plane normal to the @xmath6-axis , in which @xmath7 is constant , corresponds to the constant energy surface .",
    "the spin torque strength , @xmath23 in eq . ( [ eq : llg ] ) , is [ 18]-[20 ] @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the cross section area and the thickness of the free layer .",

    "the self - oscillation was observed for the current @xmath40 ma .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath54 depends on that of @xmath28 , and the self - oscillation occurs only for the positive ( negative ) current for the positive ( negative ) @xmath28 .",
    "this is because a finite energy is supplied to the free layer for @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 . in the case of @xmath58 ,",
    "the average of the work done by the spin torque is zero , and thus , the self - oscillation does not occur .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath59 in the limit of @xmath60 .",
    "this means the magnetization can not cross over the @xmath61-plane , and stays in the north hemisphere ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the average of the work done by spin torque becomes zero in the @xmath61-plane ( @xmath62 ) because the direction of the spin torque is parallel to the constant energy surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy dissipation due to the damping is finite in the presence of the applied field [ 21 ] .",
    "then , @xmath63 , which means the damping moves the magnetization to the north pole .",
    "thus , the magnetization can not cross over the @xmath61-plane .",
    "the controllable range of the oscillation frequency by the current is @xmath64 , which is independent of the magnitude of the applied field .    since the spin torque breaks the axial symmetry of the free layer along the @xmath6-axis , the assumption that the tilted angle is constant used above is , in a precise sense , not valid , and the @xmath6-component of the magnetization oscillates around a certain value .",
    "then , the magnetization can reach the @xmath61-plane and stops its dynamics when a large current is applied . however , the value of such current is more than 15 ma for our parameter values , which is much larger than the maximum of the experimentally available current .",
    "thus , the above formulas work well in the experimentally conventional current region .    contrary to the system considered here ,",
    "the oscillation behaviour of an mtj with an in - plane magnetized free layer and a perpendicularly magnetized pinned layer has been widely investigated [ 23]-[26 ] .",
    "the differences of the two systems are as follows .",
    "first , the oscillation frequency decreases with increasing the current in our system while it increases in the latter system .",
    "second , the oscillation frequency in our system in the large current limit becomes independent of the @xmath6-component of the magnetization while it is dominated by @xmath65 in the latter system .",
    "the reasons are as follows . in our system , by increasing the current , the magnetization moves away from the @xmath6-axis due to which the effect of the anisotropy field on the oscillation frequency decreases , and the frequency tends to @xmath66 , which is independent of the anisotropy . on the other hand , in the latter system , the magnetization moves to the out - of - plane direction , due to which the oscillation frequency is strongly affected by the anisotropy ( demagnetization field ) .",
    "the macrospin model developed above reproduces the experimental results with the free layer of 2 nm thick [ 17 ] , for example the current - frequency relation , quantitatively .",
    "although only the zero - temperature dynamics is considered in this paper , the macrospin llg simulation at a finite temperature also reproduces other properties , such as the power spectrum and its linewidth ,",
    "well . however , when the free layer thickness further decreases , an inhomogeneous magnetization due to the roughness at the mgo interfaces may affects the magnetization dynamics : for example , a broadening of the linewidth .",
    "the field - like torque arises from the spin transfer from the conduction electrons to the local magnetizations , as is the spin torque .",
    "when the momentum average of the transverse spin of the conduction electrons relaxes in the free layer very fast , only the spin torque acts on the free layer [ 19 ] . on the other hand , when the cancellation of the transverse spin is insufficient , the field - like torque appears .",
    "the field - like torque added to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) is @xmath67 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath68 characterizes the ratio between the magnitudes of the spin torque and the field - like torque .",
    "the value and the sign of @xmath68 depend on the system parameters such as the band structure , the thickness , the impurity density , and/or the surface roughness [ 22],[27]-[29 ] .",
    "the magnitude of the field - like torque in mtj is much larger than that in gmr system [ 30],[31 ] because the band selection during the tunneling leads to an insufficient cancellation of the transverse spin by the momentum average .     with ( a ) @xmath69 , ( b ) @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
