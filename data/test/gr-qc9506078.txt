    "the recent discovery by choptuik and others @xcite of new and unexpected critical behavior in gravitational collapse has sparked efforts , both numerical and analytic , to understand these phenomena .",
    "one would especially like to understand the nature of the black hole scaling relation , and how the observed echoing arises out of the einstein equations . that these phenomena appear for a variety of different matter fields",
    "suggests that they may reflect universal properties of the einstein equations .",
    "choptuik originally conjectured that the exponent , @xmath1 , in the threshold scaling relation for black holes mass , @xmath2 was universal for collapse of a scalar field , and presented considerable evidence . here",
    "@xmath3 is some parameter which characterizes the strength of the initial conditions , and @xmath4 is the threshold value , _",
    "i.e. , _ the value for the critical solution . work by abrahams and evans @xcite on vacuum collapse in axial symmetry , and evans and coleman @xcite on collapse of a radiation fluid , suggested a broader universality or near - universality of @xmath1 ( see also @xcite ) among different matter models .",
    "all these results were obtained by numerical relativity , so that accuracy of @xmath1 was at best @xmath5 .",
    "however , maison @xcite showed that fluid collapse models with an equation of state given by @xmath6 have a critical exponent @xmath1 that depends strongly on the parameter @xmath7 in the range @xmath8 .",
    "( evans and coleman had examined only the case for radiation fluid , @xmath9 . )",
    "maison used an accurate perturbation theory method , as suggested by evans and coleman , and carried out by koike , hara & adachi @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory affords both a calculation of @xmath1 , and a test of stability .    just at the critical value @xmath10",
    " at the  black hole threshold  a critical solution of the field equation appears , a  choptuon \" .",
    "a choptuon is a delicately poised dynamical state of the fields , a collapsing , shrinking , radiating ball of field energy .",
    "its self - gravity gives rise to spacetime curvature that partially traps field energy , but only partially : energy continually leaks outward and becomes outgoing radiation . by",
    "careful tuning of @xmath3 , the rate of collapse exactly balances the radiation rate , so that the collapse becomes self - similar , and the choptuon shrinks all the way down to the planck scale .",
    "this situation is of course intrinsically unstable : if self - gravity is a little too weak , the choptuon will soon dissipate completely ; if a little too strong , it will soon form an event horizon and undergo terminal gravitational collapse into a black hole much larger than the planck mass .",
    "construction of the choptuon implies stabilization , by careful tuning of a parameter @xmath3 , against this threshold instability toward either subcritical dissipation or supercritical black hole formation . we will call this instability the  black hole instability \" for short , bearing in mind that its other side is dissipation",
    "the critical exponent @xmath1 measures the strength of the black hole instability .",
    "then the question of stability of the choptuon is this : does the choptuon have any _ other _ instabilities , aside from the inevitable black hole instability ?",
    "the previous evidence is that choptuons are in fact stable in this sense @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we return to the gravitational collapse of a massless complex scalar field in spherical symmetry , as a good theoretical laboratory in which to address these issues . in @xcite",
    " hereinafter called paper i  we derived a new continuously self - similar choptuon at the threshold of black hole formation , and constructed the complete spacetime . the discrete echoing seen in the original choptuon @xcite reappeared as continuous phase oscillations of the complex scalar field .",
    "however , the choptuon by itself does not yield the black hole scaling relation ; one needs to perturb the choptuon .",
    "in addition , perturbation theory can probe important questions about the stability of choptuons , and the nature of the relative attractor in the space of all initial conditions .",
    "this paper considers only spherically symmetric perturbations , the relevant ones for eq .",
    "( [ bhmass ] ) , and the most likely ones to be unstable .",
    "it would also be interesting to carry out a nonspherical perturbation analysis of any of the known choptuons , to check choptuik s  no hair \" conjecture @xcite .",
    "the properties of the critical solution are described in paper i , and will not be repeated here . since there is confusion in the literature on this point ,",
    "we emphasize again that the self - similar hypothesis  whether discrete @xcite or continuous @xcite  is _ not _ unphysical for gravitational collapse in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "no self - similar spacetime is asymptotically flat when extended to infinity ( except flat spacetime ) ; however this is no problem , because the self - similar spacetime can be matched onto an asymptotically flat spacetime at some large radius , and within this radius the self - similar approximation is a good one ; in fact , it becomes increasingly good and natural as the collapse proceeds to small scales at threshold @xcite .",

    "the first mode is real ; as expected it corresponds to formation of black holes off threshold , and it yields a value @xmath11 . the second growing mode  actually a conjugate pair of modes  is oscillatory and must correspond to an instability of the critical solution on threshold .",

    "viii discusses significance of the results .",

    "furthermore , there holds a conjugacy relation , @xmath127 which means that @xmath116 need only be evaluated for @xmath128 in the lower half plane .",

    "generally the accuracy was about @xmath132 .",
    "there are five values of @xmath52 in the lower half plane at which @xmath124 vanishes , signalling five modes .",
    "all five are simple zeros ; see fig .  1 .",
    "-1 in    -1 in    0.5 in two of these modes are pure gauge modes , eqs .",

    "the third solution also lies on the negative imaginary axis , at @xmath133 we interpret this mode as the instability toward forming an infinitesimal black hole , eq .",
    "( [ bhmass ] ) .",
    "this corresponds through eq .",
    "( [ getg ] ) to a critical exponent of @xmath134 .",
    "this value differs from that found by choptuik @xcite for the real scalar field , further evidence of non - universality .",
    "the fourth and fifth solutions form a conjugate pair lying at @xmath135 the presence of this pair of zeros in the lower half plane means that the continuously self - similar critical solution is unstable to perturbations , even among solutions  tuned \" to the black hole threshold .",
    "these represent a pair of modes that are not just growing , but oscillating as well .",
    "these modes must grow until they become nonlinear , and then plausibly they go over to choptuik s solution .",
    "we evaluated @xmath118 around a large rectangular contour @xmath121 bounded by @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( detouring around the three zeros on the imaginary axis ) and used eq .",
    "( [ count ] ) to count the zeros lying within .",
    "the absence of other zeros in this large rectangle was thereby established .",
    "asymptotically , we observed @xmath138 in both the real and imaginary directions , and the outer boundaries of the large rectangle appeared to be well into the asymptotic regime .",
    "thus it appears very likely that there are no zeros in the lower half @xmath52 plane other than the five described above .",
    "a comment is in order concerning the error of our numerical solution .",
    "the error for the complex choptuon constructed in paper i was a little better than @xmath132 . to investigate how the error of the unperturbed solution affected the results in the perturbed problem , we varied the parameters of the unperturbed choptuon by @xmath139 . the effect on the above zeros was a variation of about @xmath139 .",
    "we also varied the initial values for the perturbed problem ( independent of the change in the unperturbed choptuon ) in order to study whether the locations of the zeros were sensitive to this variation .",
    "the resulting change in the values was on the order of @xmath132 .",
    "this exercise also verified that the taylor expansions at the endpoints 0 and @xmath77 are of adequate order .",
    "since our integrator uses an adaptive stepsize , we did not vary the stepsize directly ; rather we varied the algorithmic error tolerance used to adjust the stepsize , and we allowed the initial stepsize , @xmath15 , and the location of the matching point , @xmath140 , to be random numbers within a specific range : @xmath141    the combined effect of varying the parameters of the original choptuon by several times their quoted error , and of varying the initial values and other parameters for the perturbed problem , then gave the overall uncertainties quoted above .    thus we conclude that the critical exponent obtained here , @xmath134 , is indeed different from others that have been calculated to date , such as @xmath142 , as found for radiation fluid collapse by koike , hara & adachi @xcite .",
    "we have perturbed the continuously self - similar complex choptuon @xcite and find the critical exponent for black hole mass , eq .",
    "( [ bhmass ] ) to be @xmath143 further evidence for non - universality of @xmath1 .",
    "we also find a further , oscillatory instability in this choptuon .    in spherically symmetric collapse of a real scalar field , choptuik @xcite observed that the real , discretely self - similar choptuon could be constructed by tuning only one ( real ) parameter @xmath3 of the infinite number of parameters in the space @xmath144 of initial conditions .",
    "that is , the real choptuon is an attractor in a subspace of codimension 1 in @xmath145 .",
    "the results here for complex scalar fields imply that the continuously self - similar complex choptuon would require tuning of some three ( real ) parameters @xmath3 , @xmath90 , @xmath28 in the space @xmath146 of spherically symmetric initial conditions  one ( @xmath3 ) to control the real black hole mode , two more ( @xmath147 ) to control the pair of oscillatory modes .",
    "therefore the complex choptuon appears to be an attractor of codimension 3 in @xmath146 on threshold  with only @xmath3 tuned  it is highly plausible that the oscillatory instability found here in the complex choptuon would evolve nonlinearly toward the original real choptuon .",
    "otherwise , it would have to evolve toward still a third choptuon , for which there is currently no evidence .",
    "numerical relativity @xcite is needed to follow this nonlinear evolution .",
    "in fact , the growth rate of the oscillatory mode ( measured by @xmath148 ) is small , @xmath149% of the growth rate of the black hole mode , eqs .",
    "( [ mode3 ] , [ mode4 ] ) , and consequently the oscillatory instability may be hard to isolate numerically",
    ". it would be interesting to study related models such as a complex scalar field with a conformal coupling @xmath150 , or the axion / dilaton fields @xcite , to see what happens to the oscillatory growing mode .",
    "this mode might conceivably move into the upper half @xmath52 plane to become stable .",
    "choptuons thus show both similarities and differences compared to stationary black holes . for classical black holes ,",
    "the uniqueness theorems show that `` black holes have no hair '' , and perturbation theory proves that black holes are stable in vacuum , or when coupled to massless fields . on the other hand , classical choptuons",
    "coupled to a massless complex scalar field show at least two alternative states , namely the original choptuon @xcite and the complex choptuon @xcite . in this paper",
