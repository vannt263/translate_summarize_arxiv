    "the structure of polymers in solution is determined by the solvent - polymer interaction . in the case of a nonpolar polymer in an nonpolar solvent , one typically distinguishes three  types  of solvent , good , @xmath0 or marginal , and poor . in the case of a good solvent",
    "the solvent - solvent , solvent - polymer , and polymer - polymer interactions effectively result in a situation , where the chain monomers are preferably surrounded by solvent molecules . as a result",
    "the chains are extended and the size scales as @xmath1 with n being the number of monomers and @xmath2 in three dimensions . for poor solvent",
    "one observes just the opposite and the chains collapse into a dense globule , @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath0 regime is where these two effects compensate and the chains behaves to a first approximation as a random walk , i.e. , @xmath4 . in the limit of @xmath5",
    "the @xmath0-point is a tricritical point in the phase diagram .",
    "as long as the solvent does not induce special local correlations beyond an unspecific attraction / repulsion and one is not studying dynamical properties the collapse of polymers is usually studied with an implicit solvent .",
    "the complicated local interactions are accounted for by an effective interaction between the chain beads .",
    "studies of that kind have a long tradition in polymer science and the behavior is now well understood . beyond",
    "that there are however many situations , where it becomes difficult or even questionable , to ignore the local structure of the solvent .",
    "solvent can play an important role in the functional properties of macromolecules .",
    "for example , dehydration studies of proteins solvated in water demonstrated that at least a monolayer of water is needed for full protein functionality@xcite .",
    "the influence of a macromolecule on the structure and dynamics of the surrounding solvent is also an important issue .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of interactions of a macromolecule with a solvent beyond effective coupling parameters is quite often required for an understanding of the macromolecule s structure , dynamics , and function . to determine the interactions of a solvent with a macromolecular solute chemistry specific interactions on the atomic level of detail have to be considered . however , the resulting solvating phenomena manifest themselves at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales@xcite and in the overall structure of the chains . due to large number of degrees of freedom ( dofs )",
    "such systems are difficult to tackle using all - atom computer simulations@xcite .",
    "moreover , the vast majority of the simulation time is typically spent treating the solvent and not the polymer or protein . a step to bridge the gap between the time and length scales accessible to simulations that still retain an atomistic level of detail and the solvating phenomena on longer time and larger length scales ,",
    "is given by hybrid multiscale schemes that concurrently couple different physical descriptions of the system ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , we have proposed an adaptive resolution molecular dynamics ( md ) scheme ( adress ) that concurrently couples the atomistic and mesoscopic length scales of a generic solvent@xcite . in the first application we studied a liquid of tetrahedral molecules where an atomistic region was separated from the mesoscopic one by a flat or a spherical boundary .",
    "the two regimes with different resolutions freely exchanged molecules while maintaining the thermodynamical equilibrium in the system . the spatial regions of different resolutions , however , remained constant during the course of the simulations .",
    "more recently this approach was extended to the study of water@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we generalize our approach to the study of a polymer chain in solution .",
    "the chain is surrounded by solvent with",
    " atomistic  resolution .",
    "when the chain moves around , the sphere of atomistically resolved solvent molecules moves together with the center of mass of the chain . in this way",
    "the chain is free to move around , although the explicit resolution sphere is much smaller than the overall simulation volume .",
    "this enables us to efficiently treat solvation phenomena , because only the solvent in the vicinity of a macromolecule is represented with a sufficiently high level of detail to take the specific interactions between the solvent and the solute into account .",
    "solvent farther away from the solute , where the high resolution is no longer required , is represented on a more coarse - grained level . in this work ,",
    "a macromolecule is represented by a generic flexible polymer chain@xcite embedded in a solvent of tetrahedral molecules introduced in refs .",
    "this study represents a first methodological step towards adaptive resolution md simulations of systems of biological relevance , e.g. , a protein in water .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the dual scale model of a polymer chain in a liquid is presented . the hybrid numerical scheme and computational details",
    "are given in section iii .",
    "the results and discussion are reported in section iv , followed by a summary and outlook in section v.",
    "we study a single generic bead spring polymer solvated in a molecular liquid as illustrated in figure [ fig.1 ] .",
    "solvent molecules within a distance @xmath6 from the polymer s center of mass are modeled with all atomistic details to properly describe the specific polymer - solvent interactions . for the description of the solvent farther away , where the high resolution is not required",
    ", we use a lower resolution .",
    "the solvent molecules then , depending on their distance to the polymer s center of mass , automatically adapt their resolution on - the - fly .",
    "the model solvent is a liquid of @xmath7 tetrahedral molecules as introduced in refs .",

    "we use one - site spherical molecules interacting via an effective pair potential@xcite , which was derived such that the statistical properties , i.e. , the center of mass radial distribution function and pressure , of the high resolution liquid are accurately reproduced .",
    "this is also needed for the present study , since the motion of the high resolution sphere should not be linked to strong rearrangements in the liquid .",
    "the high and low resolution freely exchange molecules through a transition regime containing hybrid molecules ( see figure [ fig.1 ] ) , where the molecules with no extra equilibration adapt their resolution and change the number of dofs accordingly@xcite .",
    "the polymer is modeled as a standard bead - spring polymer chain@xcite .",
    "it contains @xmath25 monomers , which represent chemical repeat units , usually comprising several atoms .",
    "the interactions between monomers ( beads ) are defined using eqs .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) and ( [ eq.2 ] ) with the rescaled values @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , such that the size of the polymer bead @xmath29 is approximately the same as the size of the solvent molecule@xcite .",
    "the average bond length between beads is rescaled accordingly . the bead mass is also increased @xmath30 to make them behave more like brownian particles .",
    "standard lorentz - berthelot mixing rules@xcite are used for the interaction between monomers and the atoms of the solvent molecules .",
    "to smoothly couple the regimes of high and low level of detail of the description of the solvent molecules , we apply the recently introduced adress scheme@xcite .",
    "there the molecules can freely move between the regimes , they are in equilibrium with each other with no barrier in between . the transition is governed by a weighting function @xmath31 $ ] that interpolates the molecular interaction forces between the two regimes , and assigns the identity of the solvent molecule .",

    "[ fig.1 ] .",

    "@xmath34 is defined in such a way that @xmath35 corresponds to the high resolution , @xmath36 to the low resolution , and values @xmath37 to the transition regime , respectively .",

    "note that one has to interpolate the forces and not the interaction potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) if the newton s third law is to be satisfied  @xcite . to suppress the unphysical density and pressure fluctuations emerging as artifacts of the scheme given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.4 ] ) within the transition zone we employ an interface pressure correction@xcite .",
    "the latter involves a reparametrization of the effective potential in the system composed of exclusively hybrid molecules with @xmath45 .",
    "each time a solvent molecule crosses a boundary between the different regimes it gains or looses on - the - fly ( depending on whether it leaves or enters the coarse - grained region ) its equilibrated rotational and vibrational dofs while retaining its linear momentum@xcite .",
    "this change in resolution requires to supply or remove  latent heat  and thus must be employed together with a thermostat that couples locally to the particle motion  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by coupling the particle motion to the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) thermostat@xcite .",
    "this bears the additional advantage of preserving momentum conservation and correct reproduction of hydrodynamics in our @xmath46 md simulations .",
    "because of the freely moving polymer chain and solvent molecules , the above scheme requires the center of the high resolution sphere to move with the polymer but slowly compared to the surrounding solvent molecules , so that they at the boundary between different regimes have enough time to adapt to the resolution change .",
    "the validity condition for our approach thus requires @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 the corresponding diffusion constants .",
    "this condition is trivially fulfilled in polymeric solutions and thus also in our simulations ( see the next section ) .",
    "we conducted all md simulations using the espresso package@xcite .",

    "the width of the transition regime is @xmath55@xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions and the minimum image convention@xcite were employed .",
    "after equilibration , trajectories of @xmath56 were obtained , with configurations stored every @xmath57 .",
    "these production runs were performed with a @xmath58 force capping to prevent possible force singularities that could emerge due to overlaps with the neighboring molecules when a given molecule enters the transition layer from the coarse - grained side @xcite .",
    "the temperature was calculated using the fractional analog of the equipartition theorem : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the average kinetic energy per fractional quadratic dof with the weight @xmath61@xcite . via eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) the temperature is also rigorously defined in the transition regime in which the vibrational and rotational dofs are partially switched on / off. the molecular number density of the solvent is @xmath62 , which corresponds to a typical high density lennard - jones liquid@xcite .",
    "we considered three different system sizes with corresponding cubic box sizes : @xmath63 .",
    "the reduced lennard - jones units@xcite are used in the remainder of the paper .",
    "to validate the adress approach for the present polymer solvent system , we carried out the analysis of the structural and dynamic properties of a polymer chain in the hybrid multiscale solvent compared to the corresponding fully explicit system where all solvent molecules are modeled with a high level of detail , i.e. , as a tetrahedral molecules .",
    "first , we focus on the explicit ( _ ex _ ) systems where the solvent is modeled with the high resolution all over the simulation box .",
    "these results are considered as the reference to check how well adress produces the same physics as the all - atom md simulation . the reference average thermodynamic properties of the corresponding _ ex _ systems ( polymer+explicitely resolved solvent ) are listed in table [ tab.1a ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     while the ratio of the diffusion constants for different chain lengths roughly follow the expected scaling , even though it can not hold precisely due to the different box sizes , we here observe a tendency to a weakly accelerated diffusion in the hybrid regime .",
    "this is most evident for the hybrid _ ex - cg _ case .",
    "two different aspects might play a role here .",
    "first the viscosity in the coarse grained outer regime is smaller , which must have an effect on the diffusion .",
    "second , the small pressure and density fluctuations in the transition regime might contribute to the effect as well .",
    "although this is only a very first and incomplete test , it shows that within the adress scheme essential aspects of the dynamical properties of the embedded polymer chain are reasonably well reproduced .",
    "in this paper we presented a hybrid multiscale md simulation of a generic macromolecule in a solvent using the recently proposed adress method .",
    "the solvent surrounding the macromolecule is represented with a sufficiently high level of detail so that the specific interactions between the solvent and the solute are correctly taken into account .",
    "the solvent farther away from the macromolecule , where the high resolution is not needed , is represented on a coarse - grained level . the high and low resolution regimes freely exchange solvent molecules , which change their resolution accordingly . to correctly simulate momentum transport through the solvent , we use the dpd thermostat .",
    "the simulation results show that adress accurately reproduces the thermodynamic and structural properties of the system .",
    "the presented methodology is an extension of adress to simulations of a solvation cavity , and represents a first step towards the treatment of more realistic systems such as biomacromolecules embedded in water .",
