    "certain exchange matrices @xmath0 are associated to tagged triangulations of marked surfaces , as explained in @xcite . in this case , the choice of coefficient rows amounts to choosing a set of laminations in the surface .",

    "we follow @xcite in broadening the category of cluster algebras of geometric type to allow infinitely many coefficient rows with not - necessarily integral entries , and then narrowing the definition of coefficient specialization , as compared with the definitions in  @xcite .",
    "the category also depends on an underlying ring @xmath3 , usually @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",

    "however , the existence of universal geometric cluster algebras over @xmath4 is proved for various @xmath0 in @xcite , and for some additional @xmath0 in this paper , as we explain below .",
    "constructing a universal geometric cluster algebra is equivalent to constructing a universal extended exchange matrix over @xmath0 by specifying a collection of coefficient rows , or universal geometric coefficients over @xmath3 .",
    "the main theme of @xcite is to make the connection between universal geometric coefficients and the piecewise - linear geometry of a fan @xmath1 , called the mutation fan .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct the mutation fan and universal geometric coefficients in the case of marked surfaces .",
    "both constructions involve a variant on laminations that we call quasi - laminations .",
    "we show that the fan defined naturally by quasi - laminations equals the rational part of the mutation fan if and only if the surface has a property that we call the curve separation property ( theorem  [ rat fb surfaces ] ) . in most cases ,",
    "the curve separation property is the following : given two incompatible allowable curves ( in the sense of quasi - laminations ) , there exists a tagged triangulation of the surface such that the shear coordinates of the two curves have strictly opposite signs in at least one entry .",
    "however , in the case of a once - punctured surface without boundary , the statement of the curve separation property must be altered slightly .",
    "( see definition  [ curve sep def ] . )",
    "a long but elementary argument establishes the curve separation property for all marked surfaces except once - punctured surfaces without boundary ( theorem  [ curve separation ] ) .",
    "we complete the construction ( corollary  [ poly grow univ ] ) of universal geometric coefficients ( over @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) for a smaller family of of surfaces . specifically",
    ", we show in theorem  [ null tangle theorem ] that the shear coordinates of allowable curves ( in the sense of quasi - laminations ) are universal geometric coefficients if and only if the surface has a stronger property called the null tangle property : if a finite collection of weighted curves has the weighted sum of its shear coordinates equal to zero for all tagged triangulations , then all weights are zero .",
    "( once again , the statement of the property must be modified for once - punctured surfaces without boundary . )",
    "we prove the null tangle property in certain cases by extending some of the arguments that establish the curve separation property .",
    "specifically , theorem  [ poly grow null tangle ] establishes the null tangle property for a disk with at most @xmath7 punctures , for an annulus with at most  @xmath8 puncture , and for a sphere with three boundary components and no punctures .",
    "it remains open to determine whether once - punctured surfaces without boundary have the curve separation property , and to determine which additional surfaces have the null tangle property .",
    "however , in @xcite , we establish the null tangle property ( and thus the curve separation property ) in the simplest case not covered in this paper : the once - punctured torus .",
    "this leads to an explicit construction of universal geometric coefficients over @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 for the once - punctured torus .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the construction of cluster algebras of geometric type , in the broader sense introduced in  @xcite .",
