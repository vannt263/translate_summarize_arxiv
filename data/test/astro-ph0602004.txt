    "the detection of short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) dates back to the _ vela _ satellites @xcite .",
    "however , only in 1993 the short bursts ( with @xmath1 s ) were recognized as a separate sub - class from the long grbs , and were furthermore shown to have on average a harder @xmath2-ray spectrum @xcite ; hereafter i will refer to short - hard bursts as shbs .",
    "the short durations of shbs suggest that they are unlikely to result from the death of massive stars , for which the natural timescale ( the free - fall time ) is significantly longer , @xmath3 .    instead",
    "the main theoretical thrust has been focused on coalescing compact objects  neutron stars and/or black holes ( dns or ns - bh )  as the progenitors of shbs @xcite . in this context",
    "the duration , which is set by the viscous timescale of the gas accreting onto the newly - formed black hole , is short due to the small scale of the system .",
    "other progenitors have been proposed in addition to the dns and ns - bh systems , namely magnetars , thought to be the power source behind soft @xmath2-ray repeaters @xcite , and accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the magnetar model is unlikely to account for shbs at cosmological distances , since even the 2004 dec .",
    "27 giant flare from sgr1806 - 20 would only be detected by _",
    "batse _ or _ swift _ at @xmath4 mpc ; magnetars may contribute to a local population of shbs .",
    "the aic model has not been investigated in detail , but in the case of a white dwarf was shown to be too baryon rich to produce grbs @xcite .",
    "naturally , without a distance and energy scale , or an understanding of the micro- and macro - environments of shbs , it is nearly impossible to make any quantitative statements about their progenitors or the detailed underlying physics . as in the case of the long grbs",
    ", this understanding relies on arcsecond positions , which in turn require the identification of afterglows .",
    "several shbs have been localized to sufficient accuracy ( few arcmin@xmath5 ) in the past to allow afterglow searches , but none have been detected at optical or radio wavelengths due to delayed and shallow searches @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough in understanding the origin and properties of shbs resulted from the localization of the first afterglows starting in may 2005 . here",
    "i provide a short account of these discoveries , highlighting the growing understanding achieved with each burst .",

    "the _ a posteriori _ probability of such a coincidence has been estimated at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the implication of this possible association is that the progenitors of shbs are related to an old stellar population .",

    "the redshift distribution of the five shbs with precise or putative redshifts ranges from about 0.16 to @xmath45 , with three of the five bursts at @xmath46 ( fig .",

    "grb051221 , on the other hand , exhibits no clear break out to at least 13 days , or @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the inferred jet angles are consistently wider than the median value of @xmath52 for long grbs @xcite .    the broad - band light curves of grbs 050709 , 050724 , and 051221 also allow a rough determination of the blast wave kinetic energies using the standard synchrotron model @xcite ( fig",
    ".  [ fig:051221-lcs ] ) .",
    "the parameters of interest are @xmath53 , the circumburst density ( @xmath54 ) , and the fractions of energy in relativistic electron ( @xmath55 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "the energies of grbs 050709 and 050724 are about two orders of magnitude lower than those of long grbs , @xmath57 erg @xcite , but grb051221 has an energy that is at least an order of magnitude larger , and potentially as large as that of long grbs .",
    "the energy scale of grb051221 has important implications for the energy extraction mechanism , @xmath58 annihilation or mhd processes related to the black hole and/or the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations reveal that @xmath58 annihilation is unlikely to power an shb with a beaming - corrected energy in excess of @xmath59 erg , while mhd processes can produce @xmath60 erg s@xmath32 .",
    "thus , grbs 050709 and 050724 could in principle be powered by @xmath58 annihilation , but it is unlikely that grb051221 was @xcite .",
    "one of the intriguing results emerging from observations of the prompt emission and x - ray afterglows is evidence for prolonged engine activity and delayed energy injection .",
    "a hint of this result was already available from summed light curves of batse shbs , which led to the possible detection of excess emission peaking @xmath61 s after the burst with a duration of @xmath62 s @xcite .",
    "this was originally proposed as evidence for afterglow emission , but there is now evidence from grbs 050709 and 050724 that this is not the case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flares ] ) .",
    "in addition to the early flares , the light curves of grbs 050724 and 051221 exhibit evidence for delayed energy injection @xcite , which may arise from extended engine activity and/or a wide distribution of ejecta lorentz factors .",
    ".physical properties of shbs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     given the short lifetime and dynamical timescale in the case of dns or ns - bh mergers , the theoretical expectation is for simple afterglow evolution and a short duration of the @xmath2-ray emission . the x - ray flares do not fit naturally in this scenario , although delayed activity arising from fragmentation of the accretion disk has been proposed and argued to agree with the basic observational signatures @xcite .",
    "an intriguing alternative , in the context of accretion - induced collapse , is that the flares result from the interaction of the emerging blast wave with the giant companion star , with the timescale and duration of the flare set by the binary separation and the radius of the companion @xcite .",
    "two observations can be used to test this scenario : ( i ) multiple flares , and ( ii ) if most shbs are collimated , then only the small fraction whose jets intercept the companion should exhibit flares .",
    "one of the main clues that long grbs are related to the death of massive stars came from their association with star forming galaxies .",
    "long grb hosts have star formation rates ( sfr ) typically in excess of 1 m@xmath31 yr@xmath32 ( and sometimes @xmath63 m@xmath31 yr@xmath32 @xcite ) , stellar populations younger than @xmath64 yr , and specific star formation rates that are higher than the general population of star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the distribution of long grbs relative to their hosts traces that of massive stars @xcite .    in a similar vein",
    ", we can use the hosts of shbs to address the properties of the progenitors . the most striking difference compared to long grbs",
    "is the existence of shbs in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the limits on the sfr for the elliptical hosts of grbs 050509b and 050724 are @xmath65 and @xmath30 m@xmath31 yr@xmath32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "even the star forming hosts of grbs 050709 and 051221 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 m@xmath31 yr@xmath32 , respectively , have lower sfrs than the median for hosts of long grbs @xcite .",
    "the host of grb051221 , moreover , exhibits evidence for an evolved stellar population and a near solar metallicity .",
    "the mix of host types is reminiscent of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , which occur in both early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note that the luminosity of sne ia is correlated with the host type , with intrinsically dimmer events occurring in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the current sample of shbs is too small to address possible correlations of the burst and host properties , but this should become possible in the future .",
    "it has also been noted that some shbs occur in galaxy clusters .",
    "grb050509b is likely located in the cluster zwcl 1234.0 + 02916 , while grb050813 is most likely associated with a high redshift cluster .",
    "several other cluster associations have been claimed for shbs that lack arcsecond positions . at the present it is difficult to assess",
    "whether the latter associations are in fact correct , but some caution should be exercised given that the probability of finding a cluster in the ned archive within @xmath68 from a random position on the sky is non - negligible , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "moreover , since none of the shbs with arcsecond positions are located in clusters , we consider the cluster associations claimed to date to be suggestive , though not secure .    finally , as in the case of long grbs",
    "the offset distribution has been proposed as a test of the progenitor population .",
    "the observed offsets in the coalescence model are a function of progenitor lifetimes , velocity kicks , and galaxy masses .",
    "predictions from population synthesis models vary considerably , with possibly @xmath70 of the bursts predicted to occur at offsets of @xmath71 kpc @xcite .",
    "observationally , the offsets appear to be relatively small , @xmath72 kpc @xcite , but we stress that given the uncertain input distributions , this test may not be as useful as originally envisioned .",
    "another set of useful constraints on shb models may be obtained from the event rates and the lifetime of the progenitors .",
    "several authors have attempted to constrain the progenitor lifetime distribution using the batse flux distribution and the observed redshifts , leading to conflicting results .",
    "the canonical time delay distribution , @xmath73 as inferred from galactic dns systems , may be disfavored by the relatively low redshifts of some shbs @xcite , but is not ruled out @xcite .",
    "other lifetime distributions ( with a constant delay or constant rate ) also provide adequate fits .",
    "the redshift distribution , particularly when augmented by claimed associations for ipn shbs @xcite , has been used to argue for lifetimes of @xmath74 gyr with a relatively small spread @xcite .",
    "we caution here that the ipn associations may be spurious and in particular bias the result to longer lifetimes .",
    "moreover , with @xmath37 for grb050813 the progenitor lifetime is constrained to be @xmath75 gyr .",
    "a more profitable approach may be to investigate the relative fraction of shbs in early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "for sne ia , which are more prevalent in late - type galaxies , similar analyses have led to the conclusion that the progenitor lifetimes are @xmath76 gyr @xcite . in the case of shbs , several authors have argued that the fraction in early - type galaxies is larger , and therefore the progenitors lifetimes are longer than for sne ia , i.e. @xmath77 gyr @xcite .",
    "this analysis is highly uncertain at the present , however , since of the three precisely localized shbs , two are in fact located in late - type galaxies .",
    "finally , the shb local event rate is inferred to be at least @xmath78 gpc@xmath79 yr@xmath32 based on the batse rate and the current redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "the true rate is likely higher due to beaming , introducing a correction of @xmath80 for typical angles of @xmath81 .",
    "another unknown correction is due to the low - luminosity cutoff , @xmath82 .",
    "the progress in our understanding of shbs over the last several months has shifted the field from the realm of speculation to a quantitative study .",
    "the observations made to date have allowed us to determine some of the most important and basic properties :    * shbs occur at cosmological distances with a relatively wide spread in redshift ; a local population may contribute up to @xmath83 of the batse sample .",
    "* the energy scale is typically lower than that of long grbs , ranging from @xmath59 erg to @xmath84 erg . *",
    "the ejecta appear to be collimated , but with opening angles that are larger than the median for long grbs .",
    "* shbs tend to occur in lower density environments than long grbs .",
    "* shbs occur in elliptical and star forming galaxies , with roughly equal numbers .",
    "these properties are in broad agreement with the dns or ns - bh coalescence models , but other possibilities remain equally viable . in particular the observed long - term flares and injection episodes , as well as",
    "the spread in energies and host types , may point to multiple progenitor systems and/or energy extraction mechanisms .",
    "clearly , an increased sample of events will shed additional light on the progenitor population .",
    "future tests may include studies of the correlation between burst and host properties , evolution of the burst properties as a function of redshift , and perhaps the detection of gravitational waves in coincidence with an shb .",
    "an intriguing possibility if shbs in fact tend to be associated with galaxy clusters is that they may provide a beacon to select clusters at high redshift , @xmath85 , where blind searches are exceedingly difficult .",
    "this may already be the case with grb050813 .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my collaborators for their hard work in pursuit of an understanding of short grbs , in particular derek fox , dale frail , mike gladders , shri kulkarni , and alicia soderberg .",
