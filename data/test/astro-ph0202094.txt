    "recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy results @xcite , showing a multiple peak structure in the anisotropy power spectrum , lend powerful support to the inflationary cosmology as the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "it is now widely expected that cumulative improvements in the cmb data will lead to progressively more accurate estimation of cosmological parameters , with projects funded so far culminating in the _ planck _ satellite mission expected to report results around 2010 .",
    "given a set of data on structures in the universe , such as the cmb power spectrum , it is necessary to simultaneously fit both for the parameters describing the global cosmology ( such as the matter budget and expansion rate ) and those describing the so - called ` initial perturbations ' ; they can not be considered separately .",
    "if the model for the initial perturbations is insufficiently accurate , or even worse completely wrong , the full power of the experiment to constrain cosmological parameters can not be exploited .",
    "the inflationary cosmology is an attractive paradigm for the generation of the initial perturbations , but even there the situation can be very complicated in general . in particular , if there are multiple scalar fields the perturbations can be a mixture of isocurvature and adiabatic , and may be non - gaussian",
    ". such initial conditions may prove difficult or even impossible to parametrize , and if such an inflation model is correct it will be a major obstacle to successful parameter estimation .",
    "however it remains a powerful working hypothesis that the simplest class of models , where inflation is driven by a single scalar field , is viable ; this creates a framework within which the necessary calculations are reasonably simple , with the initial perturbations computed either approximately analytically or exactly numerically .",
    "as yet , there is no indication from observations that we might need to go beyond this paradigm .",
    "the main goal of this article is to investigate different strategies that an observer can use to estimate the cosmological parameters , and to examine the extent to which it is necessary to adopt detailed inflationary predictions .",
    "the spectrum of the fluctuations is assumed to be produced by an underlying inflationary model and is calculated exactly by means of numerical computations .",
    "given this situation , we study how the data analysis can be performed in two different scenarios .",
    "the first scenario applies if one wants only to estimate cosmological parameters , such as the baryon density and reionization optical depth , and does not care about the underlying inflation model beyond being confident that the description of the initial perturbations used is adequate . in this case , observers typically use a power - law fit , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite , and the first question is to test how accurate a power - law fit is to typical inflationary cosmologies . in particular , we wish to know if this kind of fit is accurate enough for present data , and whether it will also be accurate enough to analyze high - precision data like that to be provided by the _",

    "together with the upper bound on @xmath73 this gives an upper bound on the scale of inflation @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : nsdnsdlnk ] might be used to estimate the theoretical error in the measurement of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . if the estimates for @xmath134 and @xmath135 turn out to be larger than the upper bound on @xmath73 we can take these estimates seriously . however , if it turns out that one of the higher - order parameters is of the same order as the upper bound for @xmath73 we can not consistently neglect @xmath73 . in this case only a banana - shaped region in parameter space of the second - order slow - roll expansion can be identified . but a warning is required at that point ; without a detection of tensors it might be impossible to distinguish between single - field slow - roll inflation and other models .",
    "if there is a significant detection of tensors , the next step is to test the consistency equation of slow - roll inflation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rsr ] ) .",
    "if this test is not passed , we have ruled out single - field slow - roll inflation . if we find consistency , the final step is to measure the scale of inflation @xmath72 and the inflationary parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . by fitting directly for these parameters , rather than the coefficients of expansion as above",
    ", we are now automatically imposing the consistency relations between the scalar and tensor spectra .",
    "this is also important for measurement of the cosmological parameters , as it ensures that the uncertainties are not overestimated ( under the presumption that slow - roll inflation is correct ) .",
    "the slow - roll shape is the preferred option for carrying out this final parameter determination , and this is also the determination which yields the definitive measures of the various cosmological parameters .",
    "these might differ from the parameters estimated from the power - law plus running fit once the consistency conditions are imposed .",
    "in particular the uncertainties should tighten as the inflationary predictions are more specific than fitting free power - laws plus running .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from theory in the measurement of inflationary parameters can now be estimated with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : e1e2 ] .",
    "having analytically reconstructed an inflationary potential , its validity can be checked by evaluating the perturbations generated by the potential numerically , which will provide a further estimate of the magnitude of higher - order corrections . if these prove significant , the numerical results could be used to ` tune ' the reconstructed potential with the aim of removing any biases in estimation of other parameters .",
    "ultimately , analytic results obtained the way we describe can be compared with a direct numerical reconstruction as described in ref .",

    "we have presented a strategy to measure the most important quantity in the context of inflationary models , the scale of inflation @xmath72 .",
    "it probes the time scale and thus the energy scale of new physics , which requires the detection of tensor contributions .",
    "sensitivity to gravitational waves is mainly provided via high - sensitivity polarization measurements , and it is these which may allow us to probe the highest energy scales for the first time .",
