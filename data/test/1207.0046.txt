    "quantum computation requires the mitigation of errors that occur due to faulty controls and unwanted interactions with the environment @xcite .",
    "fault - tolerant quantum error correction is one method for mitigating these errors with the advantage that provable arbitrary quantum computation is possible given constraints on the error rates and the error locality @xcite .",
    "there are many possible error correcting codes @xcite and the mapping of abstract models involving qubits on a completely connected graph to a more realistic local architecture leads to a number of choices that makes analytical comparison of codes difficult . in these systems",
    "it is typical to use simulation to determine the error correcting properties @xcite .",
    "although simulation of quantum systems is difficult @xcite , simulation of error correction can be done efficiently for stabilizer codes where the process of error correction only includes gates in the clifford group @xcite .",
    "a standard error model is a depolarizing channel where a pauli operator from a chosen probability distribution is applied at every possible error position @xcite .",
    "the depolarizing channel efficiently simulates common laboratory processes such as dephasing .",
    "it also serves as a good approximation for most error process that lead to a steady - state in which the system becomes maximally mixed .",
    "these are unital channels that map completely mixed states to completely mixed states .    in nature",
    "it is also common to encounter interactions with the environment that lead to non - unital error channels in which the maximally mixed states are not a fixed point of the error process .",
    "one example is amplitude damping where , given enough time , all density matrices map to a single pure state .",
    "if an error channel is far from unital , then simulating it with pauli errors gives large approximation errors making it hard to extract useful results .    in this paper ,",
    "we go beyond simulating errors with the conventional pauli depolarizing channel ( pc ) . instead of only restricting to pauli errors , we allow any subset of efficiently simulable gate errors to occur .",
    "in particular , we look at subsets generated by including all clifford group operators and/or pauli measurements to the pc channel .",
    "we show that adding clifford errors and/or measurement errors always results in more accurate approximations and results in significant improvements for most error channels .",
    "we consider an approximating error channel to be valid if it has a smaller fidelity than the target error channel and choose the best valid approximation by minimizing the hilbert - schmidt metric .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : realchannels ] we first describe the simulable error processes and introduce our expansions to the pc .",
    "we then mention two important error channels that can not be simulated in the stabilizer formalism and finally we describe our method for approximating a general error channel with our new models . in section [ sec : results ] we compare how well these models approximate the two error channels mentioned in section [ sec : realchannels ] and also a collection of random error channels . in section [ sec",
    ": conclusions ] , we conclude and describe future research directions .    throughout the paper we use @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 to represent the pauli matrices with associated eigenvectors",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "it is convenient to consider the interaction of the environment with the system for a fixed time",
    ". then the system dynamics can be represented by a set of time - independent kraus operators that form an error channel .",
    "we begin by considering all error channels that can be simulated efficiently within the stabilizer formalism .",
    "next we examine two specific error channels that are outside of the stabilizer formalism .",
    "finally , we discuss a method by which we create an error channel that approximates a target channel .",
    "the stabilizer formalism allows for efficient simulation on a classical computer of operators from the clifford group operating on states stabilized by pauli operators @xcite .",
    "the clifford group for @xmath6-qubits can be generated from cnots and the 1-qubit clifford gates . as error channels , the probabilistic application of 1-qubit clifford operators can be represented by the following kraus operators :    @xmath7    identity + @xmath8    pauli operators + @xmath9 = @xmath10    s - like operators + @xmath11    hadamard - like operators + @xmath12 for @xmath13    rotations about the face centers + @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the unit vector from the origin to one of the eight faces of the 1-qubit clifford octahedron @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer formalism also includes non - unital operators .",
    "the simplest are measurement operations in the pauli basis .",
    "more intricate non - unital kraus operations can be represented as measurements followed by gates conditioned on the measurement outcomes .",
    "we limit ourselves to non - unital operators that result in translations along the pauli axes . for each eigenstate , @xmath17 , of a pauli operator ,",
    "we define the following two kraus operators with the same classical probability :    @xmath7    measurement - induced translations + @xmath18    notice that the effect of these two operators is to discard the state with a probability of @xmath19 and replace it by @xmath20 . the effect on a state , when represented on the bloch sphere ,",
    "is to translate it toward @xmath20 .    to ensure trace preservation , we set @xmath21 where @xmath22 sums over all other operators .    throughout the paper",
    "we will refer to four sets of these error process : pc , cc , pmc , and cmc .",
    "the pauli channel ( pc ) , introduced above , is limited to pauli errors .",
    "the clifford channel ( cc ) includes all efficiently simulable unitary gates .",
    "the pauli and measurement channel ( pmc ) includes all pauli errors and all measurement - induced translation errors .",
    "finally , the clifford and measurement channel ( cmc ) includes all clifford errors and all measurement - induced translation errors .",
    "we use these as approximation channels to the error channels presented below .",
    ".kraus operators corresponding to the 4 efficiently simulable error channels .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ table : summary ]    figure [ fig : rand ] illustrates the distance between each random error channel and the best approximation as a function of the distance between the error channel and the identity channel .",
    "the fidelity constraint guarantees that the approximation will always be more distant from the identity than the error is .",
    "notice that as the amount of operators in the error models increases , both the mean and the median distance between each model and the random error decreases and the distributions become more compact , as summarized in table [ table : summary ] .",
    "although the approximations with the cc had a smaller mean distance and a more compact distribution than the ones with the pmc , it is not clear that this difference is significant .",
    "the most important improvement occurs when we add both the unital clifford gates and the non - unital measurement - induced translations . for the cmc , for 48@xmath23 of the generated random process",
    "matrices the distance of the best approximation was less than 0.001 , while for the other error channels the fraction of approximations with a distance in this interval was not greater than 6@xmath23 .",
    "we have presented an extension to the random pauli error model which is still compatible with efficient simulation using the gottesman - knill theorem and leads to a computationally tractable description of realistic error models like amplitude damping .",
    "for ease of calculation , we have used the average distance as the measure to be optimized under two different fidelity constraints of the error channels relative to an error free channel .",
    "we have also only focused on single qubit errors in the absence of quantum operations .",
    "once we consider simulating operations over many qubits , we will need a distance measure that is composable over tensors . a more natural distance measure in this regard",
    "is the diamond norm @xcite .",
    "our method can be extended to multi - qubit channels but the optimization becomes more difficult as the number of clifford operators grows quickly with @xmath6 . in many cases , symmetries of the underlying error channels will minimize the number of clifford operators that must be considered . in future work , we will compare for a specific error correction circuit how the logical error rate compares for the models .",
    "we expect in the case of multiple rounds of error correction a substantial difference between error models with distinct fixed points .",
