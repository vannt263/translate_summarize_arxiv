    "one of the most striking feature of the light - light meson spectra is certainly the existence of the so - called `` regge trajectories '' , that is to say the linear dependence of the square mass as a function of the total spin quantum number .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : regge ] the remarkable linear trajectories of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 families .",
    "it is well known that this behavior can be obtained in potential models by using a confinement potential well adjusted for the kinematics . in non - relativistic descriptions of meson spectra ,",
    "a @xmath3 confining potential must be used @xcite , while in relativistic kinematics the linear regge trajectories are obtained with a linear confinement @xcite and results also naturally from the relativistic flux tube model of mesons @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this mass behavior is also expected for heavy - light mesons .",
    "an interesting theoretical approach of light - light and heavy - light mesons is given by the dominantly orbital state ( dos ) description @xcite for which the leading regge trajectory is a  classical \" result while radially excited states can be treated semiclassically .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , this dos model has been applied to study light - light and heavy - light meson spectra with a confinement potential being a mixture of scalar and vector components . in the case of one or two quarks with vanishing masses",
    ", it was shown that linear regge ( orbital ) and `` vibrational '' ( radial ) trajectories are obtained for an arbitrary scalar - vector mixture but that the ratio of radial to orbital energies is strongly dependent on the mixture .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for light - light and heavy - light mesons by considering the presence of quarks with finite masses and the introduction of a coulomb - like interaction and constant potential in addition to the confinement . in the limit of small masses and small strength of the short range potential , or in the limit of large angular momentum ,",
    "all calculations can be worked out analytically .",
    "one could expect that the small quark masses and coulomb - like potential do not need to be taken into account to study high orbitally excited state .",
    "but we show here that such effects are interesting to point out .",

    "the starting point of our model is essentially the same as the one presented by olsson @xcite .",
    "consequently , we just remind the basic ideas and skip a lot of technical details which can be found in that reference . in all our formulae",
    ", we use the natural units @xmath4 .",
    "we consider a system composed of two spinless particles with the same mass @xmath5 , which are allowed to rotate around their center of mass fixed at the origin , and to vibrate in the radial dimension .",
    "the lagrange coordinates are the interdistance @xmath6 and the rotation angle @xmath7 , angle between an arbitrary fixed direction and the line joining the two particles .",
    "the free relativistic lagrangian is very easy to write and depends on the lagrange coordinates and their time derivatives . in order to handle the dynamics between the particles ,",
    "we introduce phenomenologically an interaction potential which depends on the radial coordinate @xmath6 only .",
    "in fact , there exist two lorentz structures for this potential : a scalar term @xmath8 which simply modifies the mass ( @xmath9 ) , and a vector term @xmath10 which is simply subtracted from the lagrangian . consequently the starting lagrangian is given by @xmath11 this formula can be applied to particles with spin in a very crude manner by considering spin dependent potential terms .",
    "one can see that @xmath12 is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the angular momentum @xmath13 is a good quantum number .",
    "taking into account this condition , the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath14 the idea of the model is to make a classical approximation by considering uniquely the classical circular orbits ( lowest energy states with given @xmath15 ) , defined by @xmath6=@xmath16 , and thus @xmath17 and @xmath18=0 .",
    "let us denote @xmath19 by using the condition @xmath20 and performing a number of analytical transformations ( see ref .",

    "( [ 2.4 ] ) to get @xmath25 . up to now",
    ", we are in position to obtain only the ground state energy for a given @xmath15 . in order to get the radial excitations ,",
    "it is useful to make a harmonic approximation around the previous classical orbits . here again , the details can be found in ref .",
    "the harmonic quantum energy is given by @xmath26^{1/2}}{m_0(j)-v_0}.\\ ] ] then the mass of the system with an orbital excitation @xmath15 and a radial excitation @xmath27 ( 0 , 1 ,  ) is given , within this approximation , by @xmath28 in this general formulation , one sees that there exists , in principle , a coupling between the orbital and the radial excitations . in relativistic descriptions of two particle systems ( for example in the meson sector ) , it is generally the square of the mass which is considered as the function of the orbital and radial quantum numbers . if one assumes that @xmath29 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , then one can write @xmath30        in the previous subsection , we gave a formalism applicable to any type of potential .",
    "such a study could be undertaken from the numerical point of view , by solving the equations giving @xmath16 and reporting the value in the expression of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however there are some drawbacks to proceed that way .",
    "first , because of non linearity , there can exist several solutions for eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) and it may be difficult to discriminate between them .",
    "second , the physical analysis is less obvious when the results originate from a numerical treatment .",
    "so , it is highly desirable to study a model for which an analytical solution is available .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author studied the spectra of the mesons or , more precisely , the regge trajectories for a system composed of a quark and an antiquark with @xmath33 interacting via a linear confinement potential that is partly scalar and partly vector .",
    "he showed that a linear behavior @xmath34 automatically emerges .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this study , but in a more general framework . first , we relax the constraint of zero mass and consider the mass of the quarks @xmath5 as a free parameter .",
    "second , we admit a long range linear confinement supplemented by a short range coulomb part and constant potential .",
    "indeed quantum chromodynamics tells us that it should be so .",
    "the one - gluon exchange process gives rise to a coulomb term of vector type , while multigluon exchanges are responsible for the linear confinement .",
    "since we ignore the lorentz structure of the confinement , we suppose , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that it is partly scalar and partly vector .",
    "the importance of each one is reflected through a parameter @xmath35 whose value is 0 for a pure vector , and 1 for a pure scalar .",
    "thus , in this paper , we apply the previous formalism , with potentials given by @xmath36 in which @xmath37 is the usual string tension , whose value should be around 0.2 gev@xmath38 , and @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is proportional to the strong coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "a reasonable value of @xmath40 should be in the range 0.1 to 0.6 .",
    "we will show below that we are able to obtain an analytical solution for this rather realistic situation .      in our case",
    ", we are faced with a number of parameters , whose origin is very different    * the mass @xmath5 ( in gev ) , the string constant @xmath37 ( in @xmath42 ) and the coulomb constant @xmath40 ( dimensionless ) are dynamical parameters ; * the @xmath35 parameter ( dimensionless ) reflects our ignorance about the lorentz structure of the confinement ; * the quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath27 of the state .    in what follows , we will be interested by the variation of @xmath43 as a function of quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath27 , and for a given set of physical parameters @xmath44 . @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath27 , as well as @xmath32 , so that the @xmath27 dependence is rather obvious ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.7p ] ) ) .",
    "let us focus on the dependence on @xmath15 and on the physical parameters .",
    "actually , it is possible to exploit a scaling law in our equation .",
    "one can remark that @xmath45 is an energy unit , and @xmath46 a length unit , so that it is advantageous to work with these natural units .",
    "let us define reduced dimensionless quantities , labeled with an overhead bar , relative to these units .",

    "it should be stressed that this case corresponds to the study of ( ref .",

    "* the complicated equation ( [ 2.5 ] ) simplifies in our particular case to a polynomial of eighth order in @xmath48 ( eq .  (",

    "although we are not able to prove that the physical solution is always unique , it seems that this is a general property ; we remarked that this was always true for a wide range of parameters and for the cases for which an analytical solution can be found ( see below ) .",

    "equation  ( [ 2.19 ] ) is the exact expression valid for large @xmath15 ; we succeeded in getting an analytical expression in our model .",
    "it is very powerful since it is universal and the various dependencies are explicitly seen .",
    "one can make the following comments .",
    "* the dominant term for large @xmath15 is linear , so that we recover pure regge trajectories .",
    "as far as the string tension is consider as a constant , the slope of the regge trajectories @xmath102 is universal in the sense that it is independent of the system ( it is also independent on the strong coupling constant ) . only the confinement drives the behavior ; moreover the slope depends on @xmath35 , the percentage of scalar confinement . *",
    "the slope of the vibrational trajectories @xmath103 presents the same characteristics .",
    "even more important , the ratio of the slopes for radial and orbital trajectories @xmath104 depends only on @xmath35 .",
    "this ratio is greater than 1 , as indicated by experimental data . *",
    "the next to dominant term behaves like @xmath105 and deforms the straight trajectories for low values of @xmath15 .",
    "it must be emphasized that this term is due only to a non zero mass and is independent of the strong coupling constant .",
    "moreover , this term is absent whatever the system if the confinement is purely of vector type , since @xmath106 . *",
    "the displacement of the trajectories from the origin has three contributions ; one @xmath107 is due to the mass , another @xmath108 is due to the strong coupling constant and the last one @xmath109 reflects the zero point motion of the harmonic vibration .",
    "the position above or below the origin depends upon the relative importance of each contribution ( do not forget that @xmath88 and @xmath90 are always @xmath110 but that @xmath89 is always @xmath1110 ) . the zero point energy of the orbital motion can not obviously be calculated in our model .",
    "* there is no coupling between orbital and radial motion for large @xmath15 values ( absence of terms @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is only a consequence of the coulomb+linear nature of the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "this may not be true for other types of potentials .",
    "it is well known that , in traditional spectroscopy relying upon schrdinger or spinless - salpeter equation , it is necessary to add a constant term to the potential in order to get the absolute values of the spectra . in those models ,",
    "the effect of this constant is just to shift the absolute spectrum keeping the same relative spectrum .",
    "one can raise the question of adding a constant potential in our model .",
    "we will see that it is not so difficult to answer this question in our framework .    in principle",
    "it is possible to add a constant @xmath113 to the vector potential and a constant @xmath114 to the scalar potential .",
    "let us discuss separately these two cases .",
    "if we add a constant @xmath113 to @xmath10 , this does not affect the functions @xmath115 , @xmath8 , and @xmath116 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) , it is clear that the value @xmath16 remains unchanged , and thus all the quantities depending on @xmath16 remain unchanged except @xmath117 which is change to @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , from eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) , @xmath31 is changed to @xmath119 and @xmath32 remains unchanged since it depends only on @xmath120 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) ) .",
    "then @xmath83 is changed to @xmath121 .",
    "squaring this quantity and keeping only the terms to good order , the net effect of @xmath113 is to add supplementary terms to the @xmath87 and @xmath88 coefficients .",
    "let us now add a constant term @xmath114 to @xmath8 ; @xmath10 and all the derivatives are unchanged . since , in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) , @xmath15 depends on @xmath8 , @xmath16 does depend on @xmath114 .",
    "but we see that it is always the value @xmath122 which appears .",
    "if we introduce a new mass @xmath123 , we see that the new value of @xmath16 is simply @xmath124 instead of @xmath125 . making this replacement in @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ", we see that we have now @xmath126 and @xmath127 instead of the non - primed values .",
    "so , the only modification in our formalism is just a change from @xmath5 to @xmath128 .",
    "but in doing so , we must consider the new value of @xmath70 defined with the modified mass @xmath128 for applying a limited expansion in term of @xmath15 ( @xmath129 can be small with respect to 1 , while @xmath5 can be large with respect to @xmath45 ) .",
    "assuming that such an expansion is justified , the only effect of @xmath114 is to modify the terms in the @xmath105 and the constant contributions .",
    "one can now gather both effects into a single formula .",
    "let us define the dimensionless quantities @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the only effect of adding the constants @xmath113 and @xmath114 is to change , in the universal equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) , the @xmath132 and @xmath133 coefficients by new ones @xmath134 and @xmath135 defined by @xmath136 in particular , the @xmath86 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 coefficients are unchanged , so that the slopes of the orbital and radial trajectories are still unchanged in this more elaborated potential , and appears really as universal quantities depending only on scalar - vector mixture in the confinement .",
    "the same formalism can be applied to the case of heavy - light mesons in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass , as mentioned in ref .",

    "@xmath40 is more involved .",
    "unfortunately , our model is only valid for high values of @xmath15 , and , for such quantum numbers , a few ground states are known and none radial excitation @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , we can try to obtain an estimation of parameter @xmath35 by considering the mesons of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 families ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : regge ] ) .",
    "the meson masses used to perform calculations are center of gravity of meson multiplets whose members are characterized by an internal total spin quantum number equal to one .",
    "they are calculated , as well as the corresponding uncertainties , with the procedure given in ref.@xcite .",
    "using the only three available masses @xmath15 = 1 , 2 and 3 for the @xmath0 family and taking into account the error on these data , we can determine the range possible for the function @xmath168 .",
    "assuming usual values for the string tension @xmath37 , we can deduce the possible range for @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , we obtain no constraint on this parameter since values from 0 to 1 are compatible with data .",
    "the same calculation done for the @xmath2 family leads to the conclusion that @xmath35 must be very close to 0 , that is to say that the confinement is only of vector - type .",
    "we have remarked that the results are very sensitive to the value of the masses .",
    "if other states with higher values of @xmath15 were known , our conclusion could be changed .",
    "it is also possible to calculate @xmath35 by considering a meson and its radial excitations ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "this procedure is more questionable since only the first radial excitation of the @xmath170 meson is known in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 families .",
    "nevertheless , if the calculation is performed for the two families , we find that all values for @xmath35 from 0 to 1 are compatible with the data .",
    "we have shown that light - light and heavy - light mesons exhibit linear orbital and radial trajectories in the dominantly orbital states ( dos ) model .",
    "slopes of both type of trajectories depend only on the string tension and on the vector - scalar mixture in the confinement potential . from our work",
    ", it turns out that small finite quark masses do not alter significantly the linearity , specially in the case of dominant vector - type confining potential .",
    "as expected , the coulomb - like potential has no effect on trajectories but its influence on the meson masses has been determined in the approximation of the dos description .",
    "lastly , we have shown that the ratio of radial to orbital energies depends on the scalar - vector confinement mixture only .",
    "formula  ( [ 2.19 ] ) gives the parameter dependence of square mass in the limit of small masses and small strength of the short range potential , or in the limit of large angular momentum .",
    "outside these limits , we have remarked that this formula only differ slightly from exact results in a large range of parameters .",
    "this allows to apply our approximation for physical situations and to compare our calculations with experiment .    from data available ,",
    "it is difficult to determine the value of the parameter @xmath35 , that is to say the scalar - vector mixture in the confinement .",
    "strictly speaking , our results are only semiclassical ones , and experimental radially excited meson masses are only known for small value of total spin .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations favor a dominant vector - type confining interaction .    in our study",
    ", we completely neglect the quark spin . actually , this is not an important drawback .",
    "regge and vibrational trajectories concern only mesons with an assumed internal total spin quantum number equal to one @xcite . in usual models",
    "the spin - dependent part of the potential is the hyperfine interaction stemming from the one - gluon exchange interaction ( and may be from the vector part of the confinement ) @xcite . in other models ,",
    "this spin - dependent part stems from an instanton induced interactions @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the contribution of the spin to the meson masses is small or vanishing for mesons with total spin equal to one .    in sec .",
    "[ ssec : heavy ] , we mentioned a method to study the heavy - light mesons in the limit of an infinitely massive heavy quark .",
