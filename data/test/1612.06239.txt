    "lies an energy range in which no high - sensitivity measurements are available .    on the `` pair side '' ,",
    "the main issue is the strong degradation of the angular resolution at low energy , which makes the rejection of the background noise from true photon conversions in the detector less efficient .",
    "several technologies are being considered to improve the angular resolution such as silicon wafer stacks ( i.e. , without tungsten converters )  @xcite , liquid noble - gas time projection chambers tpc ( argon @xcite , or xenon @xcite ) and emulsions @xcite .",
    "the two dominant contributions to the photon angular resolution are , on the one hand the single track angular resolution of the two leptons , and on the other hand the impossibility to measure the momentum of the recoiling ion .",
    "as the tracking performance improves , the missing recoil momentum becomes dominant .",
    "it is therefore necessary to describe it accurately in detector simulations .",
    "additionally , the conversion azimuthal angle of the electron and the positron with respect to the flight direction of the incident photon can in principle enable the measurement of the polarisation fraction and the polarisation angle of the source  @xcite .",
    "with the low - density detectors presently under development , the track directions can be measured with enough precision before multiple scattering ruins the azimuthal information carried by the pair  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results of a recent experimental campaign on a particle accelerator beam are extremely encouraging in that regard  @xcite .",
    "as the technology improves , we see the necessity to validate the event generators used in detector simulations . in the present paper",
    "we reconsider the angular resolution due to the not measured recoil momentum with the new exact 5d event generator described in  @xcite , without any approximation in the calculation of the angular resolution , extending the study to the lowest energies , very close to threshold , and providing 68% , 95% and 99.7% quantiles of the angular resolution .",
    "we then characterise the behaviour of other available event generators in _ geant4 _ and _ egs5 _ , through a few key kinematic variables of the pair conversion process .",
    "finally , we examine the accuracy of these generators to describe the angular resolution and polarimetry potential for modern detectors with very fine tracking resolution .",
