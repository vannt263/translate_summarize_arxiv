    "one of the key open questions in the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity is that of understanding its behaviour in time - dependent scenarios .  in the context of string theory",
    "this has recently led to intensive investigation of asymptotically de sitter spacetimes to see what the prospects are for developing a de sitter / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "another line of approach has been to construct simple time - dependent solutions that provide ( at least to leading order ) consistent backgrounds for string theory .",
    "this has been carried out in asymptotically flat spacetimes , and recently extended to include the asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) case .",
    "this latter situation is of interest since the ads / cft correspondence conjecture could be employed to relate the time - dependence to the behaviour of the non - perturbative field theory dual . in so doing one might be able to avoid ( or at least ameliorate ) difficulties that arise in understanding the behaviour of string theory on time - dependent backgrounds .    in this paper",
    "we extend the search for time - dependent backgrounds to asymptotically locally flat / ads spacetimes .",
    "such spacetimes have a form of magnetic mass referred to as a nut charge .",
    "their euclideanized solutions have been a subject of study in recent years @xcite , in part because in the asymptotically locally ads case they are relevant to 2 + 1 dimensional  `` exotic '' conformal field theories that live on the world volume of m2-branes ( and closely related theories ) , after placing them on squashed three spheres .",
    "we consider here the multiple analytic continuation of such spacetimes to form time - dependent bubble spacetimes with nut charge .",
    "such `` nutty bubbles '' form interesting time - dependent backgrounds that are asymptotically locally flat / ads , extending the variety of time - dependent cases previously studied @xcite .",
    "the stability of these time - dependent bubble solutions has also recently been investigated @xcite .",
    "we consider in this paper the different ( even - dimensional ) taub - nut - ads spacetimes and study their different analytic continuations . after a brief overview of bubble solutions obtained from spherically symmetric spacetimes in section 2",
    ", we go on in section 3 to find three bubble solutions in the four dimensional case , all time - dependent .",
    "two of them are obtained from analytic continuation of taub - nut - ads spacetime and the last one is inspired from the first two bubble solutions . as all of these ` nutty ' bubbles arefour dimensional ,",
    "no issue of classical gravitational instability arises in contrast to the situation considered in  ref.@xcite .",
    "we then compute the boundary stress - energies associated with such solutions in section 4 .  in section 5",
    "we consider double analytic continuations of four dimensional topological nut - charged spacetimes .",
    "we find here some new static bubble - type spacetimes , and an interesting new time - dependent solution .",
    "we find that the presence of a nut charge induces an ergoregion , in which timelike curves must have non - zero momenta in a compact direction . in section 6",
    "we consider double analytic continuations of four dimensional nut - charged spacetimes with a flat subspace and find a new static bubble - type spacetime that is a nut - charged generalization of the ads soliton , as well as an interesting new time - dependent solution : it is asymptotically ads , yet the bubble evolution is milne - like throughout .",
    "similar to topological nut spacetimes , the presence of a nut charge induces an ergoregion in the static case . in section 7",
    "we search for well - behaved bubble solutions with nut charge in more than four dimensions .",
    "our search proves fruitless : we find in more than four dimensions that double ( or multiple ) analytic continuations give us spacetimes with at least two timelike coordinates .",
    "we then study the four dimensional kerr - nut spacetimes @xcite in section 8 and find that their asymptotic behaviour at late times is similar to that of the zero - nut charge case @xcite , and so such spacetimes can be candidate time - dependent backgrounds for string theory .",
    "however the presence of a nut charge can induce quantitatively different ( and sometimes even asymmetric ) particle creation and temporal evolution of the bubble .  in section 9",
    "we consider the ads generalizations of such spacetimes and find that they are beset with the same quantum instability problems as their non - rotating counterparts .",
    "we conclude with some brief comments about generalizations to de sitter spacetimes .",
    "the general form of a four - dimensional static , spherically symmetric metric can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are functions that are determined by the einstein equations .",
    "a bubble solution is obtained by a double analytic continuation in the time coordinate ( @xmath6 ) and in some other combination of coordinates on the @xmath7-section , effectively changing it into a two - dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "three distinct possibilities arise from this procedure   @xmath8 that are characterized by the topology of the two - dimensional de sitter spacetime at every fixed @xmath9 .",
    "locally these are all equivalent , being related to one another by the coordinate transformations @xmath10 globally they are all equivalent provided the coordinates @xmath11 are all unwrapped .",
    "however if any or all of them are identified , then the de sitter spacetime corresponds three distinct evolutions for the circle geometry they describe . for the metric ( [ bubds1 ] ) the de sitter evolution",
    "is that of a circle with exponentially large initial radius as @xmath12 that exponentially shrinks with proper time to a minimal value and then expands again   the worldsheet is like a candlestick . for ( [ bubds2 ] )",
    "the circle begins with zero radius at @xmath13 and then expands exponentially like a bowl . for ( [ bubds3 ] )",
    "the circle begins with infinitesimally small initial radius at @xmath14 and exponentially expands with increasing proper time like a trumpet .",
    "the bubble is located at the largest positive root @xmath15 of @xmath4 , assumed to be at least as great as the largest positive root of @xmath5 ( otherwise there is a wormhole geometry ) .",
    "the coordinate @xmath16 can either be unwrapped or identified with period @xmath17 unless @xmath18 , in which @xmath16 must have period @xmath19 .",
    "the radial variable is then restricted to the range @xmath20 and the solutions ( [ bubds1]-[bubds3 ] ) have a @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "the spacetime is geodesically complete for each .  at any fixed time",
    ", @xmath22 corresponds to the circle of minimal circumference , referred to as the bubble .",
    "this circumference exponentially contracts to @xmath23 after which time it exponentially expands for the solution ( [ bubds1 ] ) .  for ( [ bubds2 ] )",
    "this circumference has zero size at @xmath13 after which it expands exponentially .",
    "this spacetime could matched smoothly at @xmath13 onto any spacetime with a hypersurface of matching extrinsic curvature and 3-metric ( including its time - reversed counterpart ) , and so can be regarded as describing the nucleation of a bubble ( or its collapse if @xmath24 ) .  for ( [ bubds3 ] )",
    "the circumference exponentially expands from infinitesimally small values beginning at @xmath25 .",
    "it is not time - reversal invariant , and so has a counterpart in which the bubble undergoes exponential contraction .",
    "it is straightforward to show that any null curve in spacetimes for which the bubble is expanding has @xmath26 at late times , where @xmath27 is any pair @xmath28 ,  and the overdot refers to a derivative with respect to proper time .",
    "hence observers at different values of @xmath29 will eventually lose causal contact since at late times any null geodesic can only traverse exponentially vanishing changes in @xmath29 .",
    "null geodesics at fixed @xmath29 obey the equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the conserved momentum in the @xmath16-direction and @xmath32 is the conserved energy .",
    "( [ nullfixphi ] ) is an equation for a particle in an effective potential @xmath33  @xmath34 , with all allowed motions having @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath18 and the spacetime is asymptotically flat , then null geodesics oscillate between some minimal and maximal values of @xmath36 , and so by appropriate choices of  @xmath37 observers at any two differing values of @xmath36 can be causally connected .",
    "however if @xmath38 then the effective potential diverges at @xmath22 , and so there will always be some region @xmath39 which is not in causal contact with observers in regions @xmath40 .  if the spacetime is not asymptotically flat then the effective potential may become positive for some @xmath41 , in which case observers in this region are causally disconnected from the region @xmath42 . since @xmath43 it is always possible for observers at different values of  @xmath44 to remain in causal contact at fixed @xmath36 , and so any two observers in causal contact at differing values of @xmath36 will also be in causal contact if they are also at differing values of @xmath16 .",
    "the above results are generalizable to higher - dimensional spacetimes @xcite .  the same classical stability and quantum instability properties hold for all of these bubbles as for the ones analyzed in ref .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional taub - nut - ads solution is @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the nonvanishing nut charge , @xmath48 is related to the cosmological constant @xmath49 by the relation @xmath50 .",

    "solution ( [ boltmass ] ) is referred to as the bolt solution  the fixed point of the @xmath64 isometry is 2-dimensional , as is the case for a black hole .",
    "we can obtain bubble spacetimes by forming several other analytic continuations under the constraint that there be only one timelike direction .",
    "these metrics are all generalizations of ( [ bubds1]-[bubds3 ] ) : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 and all are exact solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "each is nonsingular and geodesically complete .",
    "for large @xmath36 they all can easily be shown to approach ads@xmath68 if @xmath69 . the geometry of sections of fixed @xmath36 at each constant time slice is that of a  twisted torus @xmath70  using the notation of the previous section , at each constant time slice @xmath71 , the twisted torus has one fundamental circle respectively parametrized by a coordinate @xmath72 the other twisted circle is respectively parameterized by a shifted coordinate @xmath73 .",
    "the torus becomes exponentially more twisted with time . if @xmath74 the geometry of fixed @xmath36 sections is @xmath75ds@xmath76    the quartic function @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ ftnlo ] ) has two real roots , one at @xmath77 and one at @xmath78 respectively .",
    "without loss of generality we can locate the bubble at the positive root of @xmath4 ,  since bubble solutions exist for any values of the parameter @xmath79 , positive , zero or negative ( unlike the spherical bubbles of the previous section ) .",
    "the penrose diagrams of the asymptotically flat bubble spacetimes obtained from ( [ tnbub1])-([tnbub3 ] ) are given in figures ( [ fig1])-([fig3 ] ) .",
    "the penrose diagrams of the asymptotically ads bubble spacetimes ( [ tnbub1])-([tnbub3 ] ) are similar to ( [ fig1])-([fig3 ] ) , by changing the diagonal and off - diagonal lines in these figures to a cylinder which encloses the bubble .",
    "the bubble is located on the surface of the shaded region at @xmath80 , where @xmath15  is the root of @xmath81    in the asymptotically flat case ( @xmath82 ) we obtain from ( [ ftnlo ] ) @xmath83 for the location of the bubble .",
    "if @xmath84 the function @xmath4 monotonically approaches unity as @xmath85 , whereas if @xmath86 it has a local maximum",
    ".  in the asymptotically ads case @xmath4 has a local maximum and minimum outside of the bubble if @xmath87 ; otherwise it monotonically increases .",

    "consider next the double analytic continuation @xmath91 applied to the metric ( [ tnlo ] ) : @xmath92 this metric is simply a local patch of one of the solutions ( [ bubds1]-[bubds3 ] ) ; for example under the coordinate transformation @xmath93",

    "the lapse function is @xmath94 and so is non - vanishing everywhere except @xmath95 .     in the coordinates ( [ tnb1 ] )",
    "the metric has a killing vector @xmath96 and so describes a static bubble , not evolving in time .",

    "these limits define an ` ergocone ' for the spacetime , in which @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) for all timelike curves in the region @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) . for @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 )",
    "the angle ( [ thetalimits ] ) becomes vanishingly small at large @xmath36 , and the ergocone shrinks to a pair of lines on the @xmath107 axis where the lapse function vanishes .",
    "observers using the coordinates ( [ tnb1 ] ) can , on a surface fixed @xmath36 ( with respective spacelike / timelike unit normals @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) , associate a quasilocal mass density with this spacetime    @xmath110    where we have used the counterterm method @xcite to compute the mass density .",
    "we therefore obtain a total quasilocal mass @xmath111 of @xmath112 where the integration over @xmath113 is from  @xmath114  to @xmath115  and then from @xmath116  to  @xmath117 *  * we note that if @xmath118 the total mass can be either positive or negative , a situation reminiscent of one that can occur for topological black holes @xcite .     if @xmath119 is finite then this surface penetrates the ergocone , where @xmath120 is restricted to the interval @xmath121 at large @xmath36 .",
    "since the lapse function is positive in this region , we can perform a similar calculation ; the mass density is again given by ( [ massdens ] ) and we obtain    @xmath122    where @xmath15 is the largest positive root of @xmath4 .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , there is no angular momentum associated with the killing vector @xmath123 in either case , despite the presence of an ergoregion .",
    "it is straightforward to show that both the extrinsic curvature and counterterm contributions to the angular momentum density are identically zero .",
    "interpretation of the preceding results must be taken with some care . since at fixed @xmath124 the metric ( [ tnb1 ] ) describes a torus ,",
    "observers at @xmath125 are separated from observers at @xmath126 by a line of vanishing lapse , and so their surface does not actually enclose the bubble .",
    "however observers on one side of this boundary ( e.g. @xmath127 ) could infer the above results by making use of the @xmath128 symmetry of their metric and assuming that a corresponding set of observers existed on the other side that were making similar calculations / measurements .",
    "the large-@xmath36 boundary stress - energy tensor for the bubble solution ( [ tnbub1 ] ) can be calculated by the well known counterterm method , @xmath129 as one can see , @xmath130 which means that the bubble solution has a negative mass and @xmath131 which means there exists a negative pressure in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "we see that the presence of a nut charge enhances these respective values in the next - to - leading - order term .",
    "the boundary energy momentum tensor components for the bubble solution ( [ tnbub2 ] ) also are given by the same relations ( [ tnb3stress ] ) changing coordinates to @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the last equation of ( [ tnb3stress ] ) .",
    "similarly , the components for the bubble solution ( [ tnbub3 ] ) also are given in ( [ tnb3stress ] ) changing coordinates @xmath134 and sinh@xmath135  in the last equation .",
    "we can compare the above boundary stress - energy tensor components of the bubble solution with the components of boundary energy momentum tensor for the taub - nut - ads spacetime ( [ tnlo ] ) .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the latter are given by : @xmath136 as a consistency check , we see that in special case of @xmath74 for which ( [ tnlo ] ) reduces to the 4-dimensional schwarzschild - ads black hole , the covariant energy - momentum tensor components of  taub - nut - ads spacetime ( [ tnlo ] ) reduce to the same as obtained in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the non - vanishing boundary energy - momentum tensor of the bubble solution with the components of boundary energy momentum tensor for the taub - nut - ads spacetime ( [ tnlo ] ) is a direct consequence of analytic continuation .",
    "so the boundary cft quantities related to the energy - momentum tensor ( like the central charge or casimir energy ) are the same for the two nutty bubble spacetimes and the taub - nut - ads spacetime .",
    "such an equivalence was observed for the boundary energy - momentum tensors of  bubble solutions derived from analytic continuation of the five - dimensional schwarzschild - ads metric and schwarzschild - ads metric @xcite .",
    "although the boundary theory is not known for the bubble metrics ( [ tnbub1])-([tnbub3 ] ) ( in contrast to the 5d - schwarzschild bubble @xcite , for which the boundary theory is @xmath137 sym living on @xmath75ds@xmath138 ) , since the boundary is conformally flat we can use the following relation for the stress tensor @xcite : @xmath139 where @xmath140and @xmath141 are conserved quantities constructed from the curvatures via @xmath142 and @xmath143 is the traceless part .",
    "for the boundary metric of the bubble ( [ tnbub1 ] ) , the functions @xmath144and @xmath141 are : @xmath145 @xmath146 by fixing the constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 from the boundary theory , the result of ( [ s ] ) is in agreement with ( [ tnb3stress ] ) in the limit @xmath149 , since the two constants must vanish due to absence of the conformal anomaly in the odd dimensional boundary theory . consequently the above comparison of  the stress tensor ( [ tnb3stress ] ) to ( [ s ] ) does not result in any non - trivial connection between them .",
    "in other words , in the limit @xmath85  , all of the stress tensor components ( [ tnb3stress ] ) vanish and since the boundary conformal anomaly vanishes in odd dimensions , so the boundary stress tensor ( [ s ] ) also vanishes .",
    "these bubbles have in four - dimensional euclidean space the general form @xmath150 where @xmath151 there are three distinct analytic continuations : @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 and these all satisfy the einstein equations .",
    "the @xmath113-coordinate is no longer periodic and takes on all real values .",
    "these metrics can , after a coordinate transformation be written in the form @xmath155 where @xmath156 for the respective cases ( [ top1]-[top3 ] ) .",
    "they are all locally equivalent to each other under a coordinate transformation , and so it is tempting to conclude that they are globally equivalent since the @xmath157-coordinate is not periodic .",
    "however at fixed @xmath158 the @xmath159 section describes ( for @xmath106 ) a two - dimensional anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "this spacetime can have non - trivial identifications @xcite and so can describe either a two - dimensional black hole @xcite as in eqs .",
    "( [ top1],[top3 ] ) ( the latter being a special case of a massless extremal black hole ) or else standard ads@xmath160 , as in eq .",
    "( [ top2 ] ) .",
    "another clear difference between this case and the previous cases is that the quartic function @xmath161 in ( [ ftopnut ] ) can have four real roots , which we label @xmath162 in increasing order of size . from this perspective",
    "these metrics can represent two different situations .",
    "first , for @xmath163  ( or @xmath164 ) , these spacetime represent static bubbles .",
    "the coordinate @xmath36 has the range @xmath165 ( or alternatively @xmath166 ) , and the @xmath113-coordinate takes on all possible values .  at large @xmath167 it is straightforward to show that these metrics are asymptotically ads .  both invariants @xmath168 and @xmath169 are finite everywhere and the spacetime has no singularities .  since @xmath170 is not periodic , the bubble does not close back on itself  in this sense it is not really a bubble , but it should be a valid background for string theory .  in this case",
    "each of the metrics contains an ergoregion given by the expression @xmath171  the structure of the ergoregion depends upon the value of @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "consider first the metric ( [ top3 ] ) , ( @xmath174 ) for which the ergoregion is independent of @xmath170 .",
    "if @xmath175 , then there will be an ergoregion everywhere except for a very narrow strip of infinite length near the bubble where @xmath176 , with @xmath177 .",
    "the strip slightly broadens as @xmath79 increases , as can be seen from figure ( [ fig31 ] ) , where the function @xmath178versus @xmath36 is plotted .",
    "as @xmath179 from above @xmath180 gets larger , diverging at @xmath181 , at which the ergoregion vanishes .",
    "once @xmath182 there is no ergoregion .",
    "for the metric ( [ top2 ] ) , with @xmath183 , there will be no ergoregion for @xmath184 . for @xmath185 @xmath186",
    ", the ergoregion is confined to the right half of the @xmath187 plane bounded by a curve with a vertical asymptote at @xmath188 , and a horizontal asymptote at @xmath189 .",
    "this curve has a mirror image about @xmath190 and the ergoregion for @xmath191 has a mirror image for negative @xmath170 .",
    "a typical ergoregion is plotted in figure ( [ fig32 ] ) for special values of @xmath192 in this figure the vertical axis is @xmath170 and horizontal axis is @xmath193     for the metric ( [ top1 ] ) , with @xmath194 , the ergoregion is confined to a strip outside the event horizon at @xmath195 bounded by a curve and its mirror image in @xmath170 that asymptote for large @xmath36 at @xmath196 for @xmath182 .",

    "if @xmath200 has 4 real roots ,  a second possibility emerges : the coordinate @xmath36 can have the range @xmath201 , and can be transformed to a periodic variable .",

    "this is possible only if @xmath106 , since a rescaling of the coordinates @xmath215 by factors of @xmath216 yields a singularity in the metric .",

    "finally , we can continue to the metric @xmath228 which locally can be transformed to one of the metrics ( [ top1]-[top3 ] ) via a change of coordinates ; it can be regarded as the extension of the @xmath229 case if @xmath230 is not periodic .",
    "however if the @xmath230-coordinate in ( [ topnutperiodic ] ) is identified then these metrics are not globally equivalent , yielding new bubble solutions .",
    "if @xmath231  ( or @xmath164 ) , the metric ( [ topnutperiodic ] ) describe a bubble spacetime in which the bubble expands from zero size to the finite size @xmath232 and then contracts back to zero size again .",
    "all spacetime events are causally connected to one another , and near the initial expansion ( or final contraction ) the scale factor is linear in time and the spacetime behaves like a milne universe .     if @xmath201 then the metric ( [ topnutperiodic ] ) describes a compact time - dependent 3-geometry of a twisted circle over a 2-sphere . from the previous analysis ,",

    "we close this section by noticing that in the case of  ( [ topnutperiodic ] ) , null geodesics relevant for s - waves behaviour satisfy : @xmath233 the integration involves the square root of a quartic function and so finding a closed - form relation between coordinates @xmath36  and @xmath157  for a null geodesic is quite problematic .",
