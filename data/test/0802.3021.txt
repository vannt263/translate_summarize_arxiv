    "a planar or spherical curve is an immersion of @xmath2 into @xmath3 or @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the whitney winding number of a planar curve @xmath5 , takes its values in @xmath6 , and is defined as follows .",
    "the derivative of a curve @xmath7 does not vanish by definition , and so defines a map @xmath8 .",
    "the degree of this map is the whitney winding number of @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath9 we define the curve @xmath10 to be the curve with whitney number @xmath11 described in figure cc1 .    for spherical curve @xmath5 , we define the whitney number of @xmath5 as 0 or 1 according to the parity of the whitney number of the planar curve obtained by deleting a point from the complement of @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "the curves @xmath12 , thought of as spherical curves , will be our chosen representatives for spherical whitney number 0 and 1 respectively .",
    "it is clear that regularly homotopic curves have the same whitney number .",
    "the converse is also true , and will follow from our work below .",
    "we refer to this fact both in the planar and spherical case as whitney s theorem .",
    "a curve is called _ stable _ if its only self intersections are transverse double points .",
    "we denote the space of all stable planar or spherical curves by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the generic singularities a curve may have are either a tangency of first order between two strands , which is called a @xmath15-type singularity , or three strands meeting at a point , each two of which are transverse , which is called an @xmath16-type singularity .",
    "singularities of type @xmath15 and @xmath16 appear in figure cc2 .",
    "motion through a @xmath15 or @xmath16 singularity as in figure cc2 will be called a @xmath15 or @xmath16 move , or jointly , a _",
    "basic move_. an @xmath16 move preserves the number of crossings of the curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath15 move which proceeds in figure cc2 from left to right ( respectively from right to left ) , increases ( respectively decreases ) the number of crossings by 2 .",
    "this will be called an _ increasing _ @xmath15 move , and _ decreasing _ @xmath15 move , respectively .    1 .",
    "for two curves @xmath17 in @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the distance @xmath18 is defined as the minimal number of basic moves needed to pass from @xmath5 to @xmath19 .",
    "( if @xmath17 are not regularly homotopic , set @xmath20 . ) 2 .   for a subset @xmath21 of @xmath13 or @xmath14 ,",
    "the diameter of @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 3 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the set of all curves ( either in @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) with whitney number @xmath11 , and with at most @xmath0 crossings .    in this work",
    "we prove the following two results .",
    "[ t1 ] there exist quadratic functions @xmath24 ( with positive leading coefficients ) such that for any @xmath11 and @xmath0 , @xmath25    [ t2 ] for any @xmath26 , there exists a sequence of basic moves from @xmath5 to @xmath19 ( satisfying the bound of theorem t1 ) , such that all curves along the way are in @xmath27 .",
    "we present an explicit algorithm for a regular homotopy starting with any @xmath28 and ending with @xmath10 . in particular",
    "this proves whitney s theorem .",
    "a simplified version of this algorithm , which may serve as a simple constructive proof of whitney s theorem , will appear in section con .",
    "we define the following _ composite _ move ( as opposed to the _ basic _ moves @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , which we call a @xmath29 move , appearing in figure cc3 .",
    "this is a sequence of three basic moves : an increasing @xmath15 move , an @xmath16 move , and a decreasing @xmath15 move .",
    "so , during a @xmath29 move , the number of crossings increases by 2 , but finally decreases back to the initial number .",
    "our algorithm will only perform the following moves :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 moves .",
    "2 .   decreasing @xmath15 moves .",
    "3 .   @xmath29 moves .",
    "it follows that the number of crossings of the curves along the way will never exceed @xmath1 , proving theorem t2 .",
    "we present the algorithm for planar curves , and will then present the slight modification required for spherical curves .",
    "let @xmath5 be a _",
    "planar _ curve . for @xmath30 , a @xmath31-gon in @xmath5 , is a portion of @xmath5 of the form appearing in figure cc4 .",
    "the bounded region bounded by the @xmath31-gon is called its interior .",
    "the interior of a @xmath31-gon may intersect other portions of @xmath5 .",
    "it is however assumed as part of the definition , that the corners of a @xmath31-gon are _ convex _ , as appears in the figure .",
    "this means that the immediate continuations of the arcs of the @xmath31-gon , lie outside its interior .",
    "we will say a @xmath31-gon in @xmath5 is _ empty _ , if its interior is disjoint from @xmath5 .",
    "the algorithm is divided into two steps .",
    "step 1 transforms the initial curve @xmath5 into a curve @xmath19 which is a string of empty 1-gons .",
    "step 2 transforms @xmath19 into @xmath10 .",
    "the algorithm begins by defining a horizontal line @xmath32 which crosses @xmath5 at two points and such that the portion of @xmath5 below @xmath32 is an embedded arc .",
    "this is obtained by starting with a horizontal line which is completely below @xmath5 , and pushing it upwards until slightly after it first touches @xmath5 .",
    "the part of @xmath5 above and below @xmath32 will be called the upper curve and lower curve respectively . step 1",
    "repeatedly uses two procedures , which we call procedure a and procedure b. each application of procedure a or b reduces the number of crossings of the upper curve by at least one , and procedure a also adds an empty 1-gon at one of the ends of the lower curve .",
    "we repeat procedures a and b until there are no crossings in the upper curve , and so @xmath5 becomes a string of empty 1-gons .",
    "we note the following :    [ 1 g ] if the upper curve has crossings , then it contains a 1-gon .    parameterizing the upper curve by @xmath33",

    ". then we claim @xmath39}$ ] is a 1-gon . by definition of @xmath36 , @xmath38 is the only crossing , and we need to show that the corner at @xmath38 is convex .",
    "let @xmath40 be the interior of the loop @xmath41)$ ] .",
    "if the corner is not convex , then @xmath42 for some small @xmath43 , and so since @xmath44 , we must have some @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 , contradicting the definition of @xmath36 .    if the upper curve contains an _ empty _",
    "1-gon , then we apply procedure a , which is the following .",
    "we slide the 1-gon along the upper curve , passing all crossings on the way via @xmath29 moves , until it passes @xmath32 and joins the lower curve .",
    "there are two ways that this can be done ; the empty 1-gon can be pushed either to the right or to the left .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the number of crossings in the upper curve when starting the procedure . since there are @xmath49 crossings that may be passed , and each may be passed twice , the sum of the number of @xmath29 moves when the 1-gon is pushed to the right and to the left is @xmath50 , and so either to the right or to the left we need no more than @xmath49 @xmath29 moves , which means no more than @xmath51 basic moves .",
    "this completes procedure a. it reduces the number of crossings in the upper curve by one , and adds an empty 1-gon to the lower curve .",
    "if the upper curve contains no empty 1-gons , we apply procedure b which is the following . by lemma 1 g",
    "the upper curve does contain 1-gons .",
    "take a minimal such 1-gon , that is , one whose interior @xmath52 contains no other 1-gon . by our assumption , this 1-gon is non - empty , and so @xmath52 contains subarcs of @xmath5 . if such an arc were not embedded , then by the same argument as in lemma 1 g , there would be a 1-gon in @xmath52 , so all such arcs are embedded .",
    "it follows that @xmath52 contains a 2-gon , and by taking a minimal one in @xmath52 , we know we have a 2-gon @xmath53 whose interior @xmath54 contains no 1-gon and no 2-gon .",
    "it follows that @xmath53 satisfies the following properties .    1 .",
    "all arcs in @xmath54 are embedded .",
    "2 .   all arcs in @xmath54 pass from one edge of the 2-gon to the other edge .",
    "3 .   each two arcs in @xmath54 intersect at most once .    we may think of @xmath54 with its boundary as the square @xmath33 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] with the left and right edges @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] each identified to a point . and",
    "so @xmath54 itself is parameterized by @xmath57 and",
    "so we have a notion of _ horizontal levels _ in @xmath54 , namely , the lines @xmath58 . an arc in @xmath54 will be called _ monotonic _",
    "if it passes each horizontal level once ( as in the definition of braids ) .",
    "we prove the following :    [ gv ] if @xmath53 is a 2-gon in @xmath5 with interior @xmath54 , satisfying properties 1,2,3 above , then there is an isotopy of @xmath54 ( keeping a neighborhood of the boundary fixed ) after which all arcs in @xmath54 become monotonic .",
    "by induction on the number of arcs .",
    "assume we have @xmath31 arcs and we have performed an isotopy making the first @xmath59 arcs monotonic .",
    "denote the @xmath31th arc by @xmath21 . if @xmath21 is not monotonic , then there are some extrema along @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the highest minimum ( by property 2 the extrema can not be all maxima ) .",
    "if we move from @xmath61 along @xmath21 to the right and to the left , then by property 2 we must reach some maximum .",
    "if we reach such maximum only on one side ( and reach the top edge on the other side ) then let @xmath62 be that maximum . if we reach a maximum on both sides , let @xmath62 be the lower one of these two maxima .",
    "let @xmath63 be the horizontal line tangent to @xmath21 at @xmath62 .",
    "it bounds together with the two subarcs ascending from @xmath61 , a sub - region @xmath64 in @xmath54 .",
    "the subarc of @xmath21 connecting @xmath61 and @xmath62 may not reach @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the same side , since if say it reaches both @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the left , then moving from @xmath62 slightly to the right will bring us into @xmath64 , and in order to leave @xmath64 , an additional minimum is required which is necessarily higher than @xmath61 .",
    "so assume when traveling from @xmath61 to the left , we arrive at @xmath62 from the right . by a level preserving isotopy we may assume the configuration is as in figure cc5a .",
    "indeed by property 3 , the upper end of each arc in @xmath64 must be in @xmath63 .",
    "( the portion above @xmath63 appearing in the figure , though drawn wide , represents a thin neighborhood above @xmath63 . ) we may now deform a neighborhood of @xmath64 as in figure cc5b to cancel the minimum @xmath61 with the maximum @xmath62 , keeping the property that the first @xmath59 arcs are monotonic .",
    "we repeat this process until all extrema of @xmath21 are canceled , and so @xmath21 is monotonic as well .",
    "so , we now have all arcs in @xmath54 monotonic , and by an additional slight isotopy we may assume each crossing in @xmath54 appears in a different horizontal level .",
    "we now move the top edge of @xmath53 down via the horizontal levels , until we pass all crossings . whenever we pass a crossing ,",
    "an @xmath16 move occurs .",
    "after this sequence of @xmath16 moves , there are no more crossings in @xmath54 and so the configuration in @xmath54 is as in figure cc6a .",
    "some additional @xmath16 moves bring us to figure cc6b , and then we perform a single decreasing @xmath15 move arriving at figure cc6c , by this reducing the number of crossings in the upper curve by 2 ( and leaving the lower curve unchanged ) .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the number of crossings in the upper curve when starting the procedure .",
    "the number of all @xmath16 moves we have performed is at most @xmath65 , and so the total number of basic moves is at most @xmath66 .",
    "this completes the description of procedure b.    as mentioned , we repeat procedures a and b until the upper curve is embedded , and so we have a curve which is a string of empty 1-gons .",
    "each performance of procedure a or b required at most @xmath51 basic moves , and reduced the number of crossings in the upper curve by at least one .",
    "and so the number of basic moves required to complete step 1 of the algorithm is at most @xmath67 .",
    "we then begin step 2 of the algorithm .",
    "if there are two consecutive 1-gons along our string of empty 1-gons , which face opposite sides , as on the left hand side of figure cc7 , then one @xmath29 move and one decreasing @xmath15 move as shown in the figure , cancel the two 1-gons .",
    "we call this procedure c. we repeat procedure c until all 1-gons are facing the same side .",
    "there are at most @xmath68 such pairs of 1-gons , and each such pair was canceled by one @xmath29 move and one @xmath15 move , which means four basic moves , and so this requires at most @xmath69 basic moves .",
    "if at this point all 1-gons are facing inward , or there is just one crossing , then we have reached our base curve @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise all 1-gons are facing outward , and there are at least two of them .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the number of crossings at this time . in figure cc8",
    "we describe procedure d , which is a sequence of @xmath65 @xmath29 moves and one decreasing @xmath15 move which transforms our curve into one with all 1-gons facing inward .",
    "so this requires @xmath70 basic moves .    to sum up , our algorithm required at most @xmath71 basic moves .",
    "it follows that the diameter of @xmath23 for planar curves is at most @xmath72 .    for spherical curves , we perform the exact same algorithm as above until obtaining a curve which is a string of empty 1-gons with all 1-gons facing the same side .",
    "since we are now in @xmath4 we can always think of the 1-gons as facing `` outward '' , and so if there are at least two 1-gons we can apply procedure d which requires @xmath73 basic moves and reduces the number of crossings by 2 .",
    "we repeat procedure d until we have just one or zero crossings , and so have reached @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "this requires at most @xmath76 basic moves .",
    "so all together in the case of spherical curves we need at most @xmath77 basic moves , and so the diameter of @xmath23 is at most @xmath78 .",
    "our algorithm also provides the following :    [ cor ] @xmath10 has the minimal number of crossings in its regular homotopy class , this minimum being @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , any other curve with the minimal number of crossings can be obtained from @xmath10 by a sequence of @xmath29 moves .    starting with any curve @xmath5 of whitney number @xmath11 ,",
    "our algorithm uses only @xmath16 moves , decreasing @xmath15 moves , and @xmath29 moves , and brings us to @xmath10 , which has @xmath79 crossings . since these three moves do not increase the number of crossings , the first statement follows . for the second statement , note that of our four procedures , only procedure a does not decrease the total number of crossings . so if @xmath5 also has the minimal number of crossings , then our algorithm will necessarily only apply procedure a , which only uses @xmath29 moves .",
    "let @xmath80 be the free abelian group with basis all symbols of the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 . in n1",
    "the invariant @xmath83 is defined as follows .",
    "[ di ] let @xmath84 be an oriented 2-disc , and let @xmath85 be a stable arc in @xmath84 .    1 .   for a double point @xmath86 of @xmath85",
    "we define @xmath87 , where @xmath88 if the orientation at @xmath86 given by the two tangents to @xmath85 at @xmath86 , in the order they are visited , coincides with the orientation of @xmath84 .",
    "otherwise @xmath89 .",
    "we define the index of @xmath85 , @xmath90 by @xmath91 where the sum is over all double points @xmath86 of @xmath85 .    for @xmath92 ,",
    "let @xmath86 be a double point of @xmath5 , and let @xmath93 be the two tangents at @xmath86 ordered by the orientation of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath52 be a small neighborhood of @xmath86 and let @xmath94 .",
    "now @xmath95 defines two arcs @xmath96 in @xmath84 , ordered so that the tangent @xmath97 leads to @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "we denote @xmath100 and @xmath101 where the orientation on @xmath84 is that restricted from @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath83 is defined as follows : @xmath102 where the sum is over all double points @xmath86 of @xmath5 .",
    "we mention that another invariant @xmath103 is defined in n1 , and it is shown that the invariant @xmath104 is a universal order 1 invariant of spherical curves .",
    "we define @xmath105 for planar curves in precisely the same way .",
    "we mention that it may be obtained from the universal order 1 invariant of planar curves appearing in n2 , by the reduction @xmath106 .",
    "now let @xmath107 be the @xmath6 valued invariant ( for both planar and spherical curves ) defined by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the homomorphism defined by @xmath110 .",
    "it is shown in n1 ( and applies for planar curves in just the same way ) that the change in the value of @xmath105 due to a basic move is of one of the following forms :    * @xmath111 * @xmath112 * @xmath113 * @xmath114 * @xmath115 * @xmath116 * @xmath117    applying @xmath118 to these elements , we see that the change in the value of @xmath107 due to a basic move is at most 6 .",
    "this offers a way for bounding below the distance between two regularly homotopic curves @xmath17 , namely , @xmath119 .",
    "we use this to obtain a lower bound to the diameter of @xmath23 . by taking mirror images of all curves ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath120 , and so it is enough to find lower bounds when @xmath121 .",
    "we note that the number of crossings of a curve is always of opposite parity to its whitney number .",
    "so if @xmath122 are of opposite parity then @xmath123 so it is enough to find lower bounds for @xmath124 for @xmath122 of opposite parity .    for @xmath125 of opposite parity",
    "we construct the curve @xmath126 appearing in figure cc9 , having @xmath0 crossings and whitney number @xmath11 .",
    "if as indicated in the figure , there are @xmath31 crossings along the middle horizontal line , and @xmath127 empty 1-gons along the outer circle , then @xmath128 and @xmath129 . inverting these equations gives @xmath130 and @xmath131 , so these are the values for @xmath31 and @xmath127 that we use to construct @xmath126",
    ".    direct inspection of @xmath126 gives @xmath132 and so @xmath133 . on the other hand , @xmath134 and for @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and so @xmath137 and for @xmath135 @xmath138 .",
    "since @xmath120 we obtain the following lower bound on @xmath139 for any @xmath11 , and all @xmath140 of opposite parity , both in @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath141 where @xmath142 and for @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and the last inequality uses @xmath140 .",
    "we first sum up our proof of theorems t1 , t2 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds given in sections up and low establish theorem t1 .",

    "next , we remark that the statement of theorem t2 can not be improved .",
    "indeed , it is clear that e.g. our curves @xmath126 do not contain a configuration that allows either an @xmath16 move or a decreasing @xmath15 move , and so any regular homotopy from @xmath126 to @xmath10 must begin with an increasing @xmath15 move , and so the number of crossings will increase by 2 .    in my and v a different complexity count",

    "finally , we would like to present a simplified version of our algorithm , which can not prove theorems t1 , t2 , but may serve as a simple constructive proof of whitney s theorem , stating that two curves with the same whitney winding number are regularly homotopic .",

    "shrink this 1-gon towards its corner , until it is empty .",
    "once there are no crossings in the upper curve , proceed as in section up .",
