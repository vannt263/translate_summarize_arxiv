    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is currently the most attractive theoretical framework describing physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "even the minimal extension of the sm incorporating susy ( mssm ) predicts a zoo of new particles , which have not yet been observed .",
    "one of the major areas of activity in high energy physics today and in the near future is to prove their existence .",
    "if susy is realised at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , many of the superparticles should be discovered at next generation hadron colliders , such as tevatron ( run ii , @xmath5 tev ) at fnal and the large hadron collider ( lhc , @xmath6 tev ) at cern .",
    "these machines , while having the chance of being the first to access the susy domain , are however hampered by the fact that a large qcd background and the lack of knowledge of the initial centre - of - mass ( cm ) partonic energies render difficult the task of determining sparticle properties ( masses , couplings , quantum numbers , etc . ) .",
    "an insight into this ` susy spectrum ' would in fact shed light on the yet unknown mechanism leading to susy - breaking .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath7 collisions , the qcd noise is under control and the initial energies of the leptons are generally well known .",
    "this has contributed in the recent years to the generation of a strong consensus behind the option of building electron - positron linear colliders ( lcs ) , operating in the energy range from 500 gev to 3 tev , as the accelerators most suited to inherit the legacy of the run ii and lhc era @xcite .",
    "such machines would not only provide the ideal environment for discovering the susy particles which could be missed out at the fnal and cern experiments , but would also allow for the precise determination of the mentioned susy spectrum .",
    "for example , mass measurements are aided by the ability to perform threshold scans by varying the collider cm energy .",
    "furthermore , the spin properties of many susy particles can be accessed by exploiting an efficient beam polarisation , a feature altogether missing at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "another advantage of lcs is that they can easily be converted to run quite simply in @xmath8 mode or even in @xmath9 and @xmath0 , the latter by using compton back - scattering of laser photons against the electrons / positrons @xcite , all such collisions taking place with energy and luminosity comparable to those obtainable from the primary @xmath7 design . quite apart from susy @xcite",
    ", it should be recalled that electron - electron collisions would constitute a privileged window on , _",
    "e.g. _ , models with extended higgs sectors whereas those employing photon beams would easily allow for , _ e.g. _ , the study of a plethora of qcd topics .    to come back to susy , it should be mentioned that there have been in the recent years quite promising explorations of the physics potential of @xmath10 lcs as a probe of the low energy dynamics of the theory @xcite .",
    "it is the intention of our study to further dwell on this topic , by considering the scope of lcs in accessing some r - parity - violating ( rpv ) signals of susy .",
    "the construction of the most general supersymmetric extension of the sm leads to baryon-@xmath11- and lepton-@xmath12-number - violating operators in the superpotential @xmath13 here , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the @xmath16 doublets higgs superfields which give rise to the masses of down - type and up - type quark superfields , respectively , @xmath17 denotes lepton(quark ) doublet superfields , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the singlet lepton and quark superfields , @xmath21 are the generational indices and we have suppressed the @xmath16 and @xmath22 indices .",
    "the @xmath23 are anti - symmetric in @xmath24 and @xmath25 while the @xmath26 are anti - symmetric in @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the first three terms in @xmath28 violate lepton number and the last term violates baryon number conservation .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both b- and l - violating operators would induce rapid proton decay which would contradict the strict experimental bound of @xcite . in order to keep the proton lifetime within the experimental limit",
    ", one needs to impose an additional symmetry beyond the sm gauge symmetry , in order to force the unwanted b- and l - violating interactions to vanish . in most cases ,",
    "this can be achieved by imposing a discrete symmetry , called r - parity @xcite , defined as @xmath29 , where s is the spin .",
    "this symmetry not only forbids rapid proton decay @xcite but also renders stable the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .    however , r - parity is quite an _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption in nature , as there are no strong theoretical arguments to support it .",
    "therefore , it is much justified to investigate the phenomenological consequences of rpv susy .",
    "extensive studies have been carried out in order to look for direct as well as indirect evidence of trilinear r - parity violation in different processes at various colliders as well as in order to put constraints on various rpv couplings @xcite .",
    "resonant sneutrino production in @xmath10 collisions has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rare decays into two photons or gluons were considered . in this article",
    ", we will consider instead rpv single production of sneutrinos in association with fermion pairs in polarised photon - photon collisions at 500 gev and 1 tev lcs , and their subsequent decays into two further fermions , via trilinear l - violating operators , while preserving b - conservation .",
    "the latter channel is in our opinion more suited as a sneutrino ` search ' mode in @xmath0 collisions than the former , simply because one can scan a wider range of sneutrino masses @xmath30 ( as long as @xmath31 ) , thanks to the fact that some amount of energy is carried away by the accompanying fermion pair , whereas in direct production the only @xmath32 attainable is basically the ( reduced ) cm energy itself .",
    "furthermore , the associate mode may also induce flavour changing final states , so that  as pointed out in @xcite  unlike in the case of resonant production , one has that the corresponding signatures are basically sm background free .",
    "schematically , one has @xmath33 with @xmath34 where the @xmath35 s refer to @xmath36 and @xmath37 leptons and the @xmath38 s to @xmath39 and @xmath40 quarks .",
    "finally , the main advantage of exploiting @xmath0 collisions in place of @xmath7 ones @xcite in producing single sneutrinos in association with a fermion pair in final states of the type ( [ production ] ) resides in the fact that the cross sections for the former are generally larger than those for the latter , as one can appreciate in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "there , as an illustration , we have plotted the unpolarised production rates for both the @xmath0 and @xmath7 induced modes , using the photon structure functions given in @xcite , at @xmath41 gev and 1 tev . apart from the @xmath42 final state , which in electron - positron annihilation receives very large additional contributions from small angle bhabha - like scattering amplitudes ( with respect to the other final states ) , the photon processes are dominant over the electron - positron ones processes to another paper @xcite .",
    "we should however mention here that we have verified that , given the final luminosities collected at lep2 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the signatures considered in ( [ production])([decay ] ) but produced via @xmath7 annihilations between 2060 and 210 gev could have not been seen at the cern machine , for the choice of rpv couplings adopted in the following ( see also @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the @xmath0 induced associate production process has been investigated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , by assuming unpolarised photon beams and without any detailed background estimates .",
    "we will improve on that study by exploiting polarised @xmath0 scatterings , as it has been shown that a high degree of polarisation can be transmitted from the electrons , positrons and laser photons to the compton back - scattered photons , and by including a study of the irreducible sm background .",
    "in fact , it will be shown that polarisation may help to improve the signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath43 ) in some instances .",
    "we consider a general mssm parameter space , with no assumption on the mechanism of susy - breaking , hence defining all parameters at the ew scale .    before proceeding to the analysis",
    ", it is is useful to note at this point that the @xmath44 terms in ( [ superp ] ) can in principle be removed by a re - definition of the lepton doublets @xmath45 , which would in turn lead to their ` absorption ' into the @xmath46 couplings and in the parameters of the scalar potential of the susy model .",
    "however , the @xmath44 s could then re - appear at a different energy scale .",
    "bilinear terms could also lead to a possible vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the sneutrino(s ) and mixing of : ( @xmath47 ) charged leptons with charginos , ( @xmath40 ) sleptons with charged higgs bosons , ( @xmath48 ) neutrinos with neutralinos and ( @xmath49 ) sneutrinos with neutral higgs bosons .",
    "this last mixing could indeed affect the process discussed here .",
    "however , this phenomenon is suppressed by the small yukawa couplings of our @xmath35 and @xmath38 fermions , so that we feel justified in neglecting it here ( _ i.e. _ , we are making the assumption that the @xmath44 terms are small))([decay ] ) , @xmath50 quarks contributions will have negligible impact , because strongly suppressed by phase space effects .",
    "( some phenomenological consequences of a sneutrino vev and l - violating mixing have been discussed in literature @xcite . ) ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the phenomenology of processes ( [ production])([decay ] ) in presence of polarised incoming photons . in section 4",
    "we present our numerical results ( including those for the backgrounds ) , followed by our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the rpv mssm , the sneutrino displays a coupling with pairs of leptons ( @xmath51-type couplings ) and quarks ( @xmath52-type couplings ) .",
    "single production of sneutrino in association with fermion pairs in ( [ production ] ) can occur through any of these two types of l - violating couplings . depending upon the nature of the vertex involved , the above process may also lead to flavour changing final states . the polarised photon flux and polarisation have been worked out in @xcite and are discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . for brevity",
    ", we do not reproduce here those formulae , rather we simply recall to the un - familiar reader the basic features of polarised @xmath0 scatterings .    1 .",
    "we assume that the laser back - scattering parameter assumes its maximum value , @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "in fact , with increasing @xmath54 the high energy photon spectrum becomes more mono - chromatic .",
    "however , for @xmath55 , the probability of @xmath7 pair creation increases , resulting in larger photon beam degradation .",
    "2 .   the reflected photon beam carries off only a fraction @xmath56 of the @xmath57 energy , with @xmath58 , while @xmath59 ( hereafter , @xmath60 ) .",
    "the polarization of the two initial laser ( @xmath61 ) and electron / positron ( @xmath62 ) beams are defined by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , where , for the first two quantities , @xmath65 identifies the laser colliding against the electron(positron ) .",
    "4 .   finally , one can cast the polarised production cross - section in the following form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the electron(positron ) momentum fraction carried by the emerging photon , @xmath68 , with @xmath69(@xmath70 being the cm energy squared of the @xmath7(@xmath71 ) system , and @xmath72 the photon distribution functions , defined in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 and yielding @xmath75 , the degree of polarisation of the photon that has back - scattered against the electron(positron ) for purely left(right ) handed photons . ] .",
    "therefore , in terms of helicity amplitudes one has ( here , for brevity , @xmath76 ) @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as polarised @xmath61-structure functions we have used those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the flavour of the final state fermions will depend upon the rpv couplings involved .",
    "it has been shown that most of the first two generation l - violating terms are highly constrained from different low and medium energy processes @xcite . for our study , we made the assumption that just one l - violating coupling at a time is the dominant one , so that only bounds derived under the same hypothesis are relevant .",
    "this restriction may seem unnatural , however , it is a useful approach that allows one to derive a quantitative feeling for the phenomenological consequences of rpv interactions , while avoiding a proliferation of susy input parameters . in our analysis , we will concentrate on the following l - violating couplings : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the reason for selecting this particular set out of the 36 possible couplings is that these are less constrained and at the same time can lead to a significant contribution to the production as well as the decay rates of sneutrinos in ( [ production])([decay ] ) .",
    "the upper limits on these couplings and the processes which give such bounds are shown in table  [ rpv_lim ] .",
