    "at temperatures below the critical value @xmath2 the neutron fermi liquid in the bulk matter of neutron stars is expected to develop a triplet superfluid condensate @xcite .",
    "considerable work has done with the most realistic nuclear potentials for determining the magnitude of the superfluid gap at different matter densities @xcite , while the low - energy collective excitations of such superfluid liquid are not well investigated as yet . in the meantime",
    "such excitations can play an important role in the evolution of neutron stars .",
    "for example , the decay of collective spin waves into neutrino pairs , occuring in a superfluid core of neutron star through neutral weak currents , presents a new mechanism of intensive cooling in some domain of low temperatures @xcite . a recent investigation",
    "@xcite has shown sound - like oscillations of @xmath3 superfluid neutron matter ( called superfluid phonons ) due to a very large mean - free - path influence heat conduction in a magnetized crust of neutron stars , where the motion of electrons is very anisotropic .",
    "analogous effects might be expected in the neutron star core , since spontaneous breaking of rotation invariance and the baryon number caused by the triplet condensation should lead to the appearance of several goldstone modes @xcite .    generally speaking under @xmath4-equilibrium the superdense core of neutron stars",
    "is composed of neutrons with a small admixture of protons and electrons .",
    "a fraction of hyperons can also appear at higher densities .",
    "it is well known however that long - range electromagnetic interactions push out collective oscillations of the charged particles up to the plasma frequency which is large sufficiently for ( approximate ) decoupling of the plasma modes from the sound - like oscillations of neutral component @xcite . in this case",
    "the effect of short - range proton - neutron interactions is reduced mostly to renormalization of the effective mass of neutrons participating in the collective oscillations @xcite .",
    "therefore the problem can be simplified considering the sound - like excitations in a pure neutron superfluid liquid .",
    "previously the sound modes at finite temperatures have been investigated for isotropic singlet - spin superfluids @xcite and for the case of triplet @xmath5-wave pairing in superfluid liquid @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "although a qualitative picture of the sound - like waves in superfluids is very similar , the above theories can not be immediately applied to the case of superdense superfluid neutron matter .",
    "the well - developed theory of isotropic pairing can not be applied because the triplet condensate in superdense nuclear matter is expected to be anisotropic .",
    "the theory of sound - like collective excitations in an anisotropic phase of superfluid @xmath6 is designed only for extremely fast waves with a velocity that is very large as compared to the fermi velocity .",
    "since spin - orbit and tensor interactions between neutrons are known to dominate at high densities the neutron pairing involves a mixing of @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels @xcite .",
    "the sum of spin - orbit and tensor interactions can not be described with the aid of a sole coupling constant .",
    "this complicates the investigation of collective excitations in standard ways with making use of an explicit form of the pairing interaction , where the sole coupling constant drops out of the equations by virtue of the gap equation .",
    "however , when the wave - length of the perturbation is large as compared to the coherence length in the superfluid matter and the transferred energy is small in comparison with the gap amplitude , as is typical for sound - like excitations , the collective motion of the condensate can be described in terms of total variable phase which ( in the bcs approximation ) can be derived immediately from the current conservation condition .",
    "this approach , for the first time suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows to avoid any explicit form of the interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "residual fermi - liquid interactions can be incorporated into the theory as a set of molecular fields @xcite . in application to polarization functions ,",
    "this approach is well developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains some preliminary notes on how the fermi - liquid interactions can be reduced to molecular fields . in sec .",
    "iii we derive , in the bcs approximation , the linear response of the triplet - correlated superfluid neutron liquid onto an effective vector field given by the sum of external and molecular fields . in sect .",
    "iv we express self - consistently the effective fields via external fields , thus obtaining the linear medium response by taking into account the fermi - liquid interactions . in sect .",
    "v we analyze the poles of the longitudinal response function in order to derive the dispersion of sound - like oscillations in the condensate .",
    "section vi contains a short summary of our findings and the conclusion . throughout this paper , we use the system of units @xmath9 , and the boltzmann constant @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that the landau theory of a normal fermi - liquid is based on the fact that a large part of the interactions can be taken into account with the aid of renormalizations effects .",
    "an effective hamiltonian of the system contains the renormalized single - particle energy of quasiparticles with occupation numbers @xmath11 and a residual interaction between changes @xmath12 in the quasiparticle occupation at the fermi surface .",
    "as has been shown by leggett @xcite , the quasiparticle pairing does not change the net occupation for a given direction on the fermi surface , if approximate particle - hole symmetry is maintained .",
    "thus the fermi - liquid interactions remain unchanged upon pairing .",
    "in other words , the fermi - liquid interactions do not interfere with the pairing phenomenon .",
    "in our analysis we shall also assume that the anisotropy of the order parameter , which takes place in the case of triplet - spin pairing , plays no significant role in the fermi - liquid interactions .",
    "this assumption is clearly justified because the characteristic length associated with the fermi - liquid interactions is of the order of the inverse fermi momentum , @xmath13 , and hence is much smaller than any other characteristic length entering the problem .",
    "this allows us to disregard the spin - dependent part of fermi - liquid interactions in the vector channel we shall consider .",
    "since we are interested in values of the neutron momenta near the fermi surface , @xmath14 , the amplitudes of the fermi - liquid interactions @xmath15 can be expanded into legendre polynomials . in the vector channel",
    "these interactions are spin - independent and can be completely described in terms of the infinite set of landau parameters @xmath16 . in practice even for a saturated nuclear matter one does not know the landau parameters @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and in actual calculations they are frequently put equal zero .",
    "the remaining fermi - liquid interactions can be written in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of states near the fermi surface in the normal state , and the effective mass of a neutron quasiparticle is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this approach can be considered as a model of the fermi - liquid interactions .",
    "it is known , however , that the landau interactions with @xmath17 do not modify the longitudinal response functions of normal ( nonsuperfluid ) fermi liquid . for a one - component fermi liquid this",
    "was demonstrated , for example , in ref .",
    "the same result was obtained for a one - component @xmath3 superfluid fermi liquid in ref .",
    "@xcite where the effective vertices and the polarization functions ( at @xmath22 ) have been found to depend only on @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "the triplet order parameter in the neutron superfluid is a symmetric matrix in spin space which can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are pauli spin matrices ; @xmath38 , with @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 is the @xmath41 unit matrix in spin space . in the ground state ,",

    "( [ ixx ] ) integration over @xmath67 is extended to @xmath72 since the neutron matter is extremely degenerate .",

    "( [ etilde ] ) : @xmath73 we use greek letters for dirac indices , @xmath74 .",

    "the latter can be found using the fact that the current in the system , @xmath87 is connected to the linear correction @xmath88 to the green s function of a quasiparticle in the effective external field @xmath76 and can be obtained by analytic continuation of the following matsubara sums @xmath89@xmath90 where @xmath91  is the total number density of neutrons .",
