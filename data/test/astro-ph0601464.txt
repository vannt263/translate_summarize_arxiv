    "now more than 50% of well studied seyfert 1 galaxies and many quasars are known to possess absorbers ( e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "one main issue is to explain the apparent change of slope in the overall x - ray spectrum at @xmath4 1 kev in sy1s and qsos .",
    "when fitting an observed x - ray spectrum with a power law plus absorption plus ( eventually ) the compton reflection component plus ( eventually ) the iron line and ( eventually ) narrow spectral features , the model usually underpredicts the observed spectrum in the soft x - ray range .",
    "an additional component  a soft x - ray excess  is needed ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "apart from an usual additional continuum or a strongly ionized reflection , this component is well modeled by absorption of an originally rather soft power law intrinsic spectrum due to an absorber having a random or bulk velocity of several thousands of km  s@xmath5 ( gierli ' nski & done 2004 ) .",
    "we consider the advantages and drawbacks of the reflection vs. absorption models ( chevallier et al .",
    "2005 ) , using our code titan ( dumont et al .",
    "gierli ' nski & done ( 2004 ) modeled the x - ray spectrum of the narrow line seyfert 1 pg 1211 + 143 by a steep power law continuum between 0.1 and 20 kev , absorbed by an ionized slab of constant density .",
    "note that the observed spectrum is smeared by a large ( gaussian ) velocity dispersion @xmath6 in order to get a `` quasi - continuum '' with no narrow features .",
    "this high velocity can be due to an accelerated outflow , or to a disk wind dominated by keplerian motion and produced very close to the black hole .",
    "we have computed the absorption spectra  no corresponding emission and the absorbing medium covers completely the primary source of radiation  for a grid of constant density models .",
    "any small variation of the parameters , like the column - density @xmath7 , the ionization parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the luminosity of the primary source , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hydrogen number density and the distance from the primary source , respectively , of the medium at the illuminated surface ) , or the slope @xmath12 of the primary continuum , would induce a strong variation on the shape of the x - ray spectrum .",

    "the components shown are the primary continuum ( straight lines ) , the reflection spectrum ( thin dots ) , half sum of reflection plus primary continuum ( thick lines ) which may be directly `` observed '' or absorbed by a constant total pressure slab @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( cgs units ) , with a dispersion velocity @xmath16 ( thick dashes).,title=\"fig:\",width=235 ] = 100 , right : @xmath13=1000 ) .",

    "it is more appropriate to assume that the absorbing medium is in total ",
    "gas and radiation  pressure equilibrium owing to the short dynamical time scale needed to reach again an equilibrium ( less than one day for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the thickness of the slab can not then exceed a maximum value for a given @xmath13 , due to thermal instabilities .",
    "a consequence is the existence of a  maximum absorption trough \" , which can not be exceeded .",
    "figure [ fig - comp - mod - obs ] shows as an exemple the comparison of the x - ray spectrum of pg 1307 + 085 ( piconcelli et al .",
    "2005 ) with that obtained with an absorbing slab of constant total pressure .",
    "this spectrum is well fitted , considering that the narrow emission feature around 0.5 kev ",
    "the ovii complex  must be provided by another emitting region .",
    "absorption models are not very satisfactory from a physical point of view .",
    "owing to its large column density ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) , the wind implies too massive outflows ( near the eddington limit ) . both the wind and the accretion models require an additional uv emission , which has to be provided by a geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "the coexistence of a spherical accretion flow at about @xmath22 and a thin disk seems quite artificial .",
    "so we come back now to the `` traditional '' reflection models , including a `` cold '' accretion disk emitting the uv , surrounded by a hot corona emitting x - rays which are reflected by the disk ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "figure [ fig - x2x3-spe ] shows two examples of reflection models , with @xmath15 and 1000 .",
    "the soft x - ray excess ( thick line ) almost disappears when the reflection spectrum ( thin dots ) is added to the primary continuum ( thin line ) .",
    "either @xmath13 is small and the reflection spectrum displays a strong x - ray excess , but it is negligible as compared to the primary one ; or @xmath13 is large , and the reflection spectrum is comparable in flux to the primary one , but it has a small x - ray excess .",
    "a strong excess requires to hide the primary continuum ( fabian et al .",
    "2002 , crummy et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "since both the absorption and the reflection models seem inadequate , we propose an  hybrid model \" , including the traditional reflection model , plus a high velocity absorbing medium with a modest thickness . as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig - x2x3-spe ] ( right panel ) , the small soft x - ray excess displayed by the reflection model ( thick line ) is increased when it is absorbed by such a wind ( thick dashes ) and becomes comparable to the observations .",
    "the mass outflow rate is thus 30 times smaller than in the previous absorption model .",
    "absorption models could account for some strong soft x - ray excesses , but require a kind of  fine tuning \" in order to constrain the 1 kev trough , which otherwise could have any strength ( e.g. , constant density models ) .",
    "we have suggested a medium in total  gas and radiation  pressure equilibrium , which leads to a maximum intensity of the trough , as well as a  universal \" shape of this maximum trough , due to the thermal instability mechanism . a complete grid of constant total pressure models , very demanding in computation time , is necessary to pursue this study . in the absorption model , either a thick accretion flow , or a relativistic wind is required .",
    "none of them seem realistic from a physical point of view , and moreover both require an additional source of uv emission , like a geometrically thin accretion disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the traditional reflection models involving a hot corona emitting x - rays which are reflected by a cold disk can not account for the observations , unless the x - ray source is hidden from our view .",
    "therefore we favor an  hybrid \" model , where the primary uv - x source could be produced by a disk - corona system , and then absorbed by a modest relativistic wind .",
