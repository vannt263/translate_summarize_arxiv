    "within the last fifteen years or so , the dynamical mean field theory approach ( dmft)@xcite and its cluster generalizations@xcite have become some of the most powerful techniques to study strongly correlated electrons . in these approaches , a single - site hybridized to a bath or a cluster hybridized to a bath must be solved .",
    "the bath of non - interacting electrons is determined self - consistently . at the heart of the dmft approach",
    "then , one finds so - called impurity solvers .",
    "there are now very powerful impurity solvers , for example continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) methods@xcite .",
    "these methods are exact within statistical errors and , for the one - band hubbard model , certain versions@xcite at the single site level do not suffer from sign problem . yet , these approaches require sizeable computational resources and , in addition , real frequency information must be obtained through analytical continuation of data with statistical uncertainties , an ill - posed problem@xcite .",
    "it is thus still of great interest to work with approximate solvers that are reliable and do not suffer from statistical uncertainties .",
    "this facilitates the calculation of real - frequency quantities with pad approximants@xcite or directly in real - frequency and also enables one to quickly explore phase diagrams and pinpoint interesting regions of parameter space where state of the art solvers would be useful . among possible approximate solvers ,",
    "one finds exact diagonalization , slave bosons , non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) and others@xcite .",
    "they all have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , exact diagonalization can consider only a limited number of bath sites , nca is limited to high temperatures and nrg to low energies .",
    "here we consider iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) @xcite , an interpolation approach that generalizes the original@xcite ipt applicable only at half filling .",
    "this method has been , and still is , wildly used@xcite .",
    "the interpolation is constructed so that the self - energy recovers both the exact result in the atomic limit and the high - frequency limit of the hubbard model .",
    "there is one parameter however that can not be determined from these constraints .",
    "there have been several proposals to fix this parameter . at @xmath1",
    "one can impose that luttinger s theorem be satisfied ( ipt-@xmath2 ) as was done in [ ] but when this condition is applied at finite temperature , the results are not satisfactory@xcite .",
    "another very popular approach for non - zero temperature fixes the occupation @xmath3 of the non - interacting part of the anderson impurity problem used in the perturbative calculation to be equal to the lattice occupation @xmath4 @xcite ( ipt-@xmath3 ) .",
    "this condition is arbitrary since there is no general principle relating these two numbers , but it turns out to be quite satisfactory in the case of correlated metal i.e. @xmath5@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is the coupling for which the metal to insulator mott transition occurs at half - filling .    despite this success ,",
    "it is known@xcite that when @xmath7 is larger than the critical value for the mott transition at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , then ipt breaks down for @xmath10 at low @xmath11 when the condition @xmath4 is applied .",
    "this happens even if , in principle , ipt is constructed to respect the atomic limit @xmath12 .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that preserving the third moment of the spectral weight improves the results .",
    "here we show that ipt-@xmath3 is unsatisfactory for @xmath13 close to half - filling for both @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "we propose a way to circumvent this problem by using the fact that when @xmath7 is large enough , the double occupancy becomes almost temperature independent in the paramagnetic state with a value that is , to a high degree of accuracy , a simple function of the density .",
    "this provides us with a condition different from @xmath4 that allows one to close the ipt equations even for large coupling .",
    "this approach , ipt-@xmath0 , is applicable at all temperatures contrary to the approach that enforces luttinger s theorem .",
    "it can in principle be improved further by enforcing the third - moment sum rule@xcite .    in sec .",

    "the fcc lattice is important because of its prevalence in nature .",
    "our main contribution appears in sec .",

    "one extracts the frequency - dependent self - energy of the anderson model , which is then taken as the self - energy in the lattice green s function .",
    "the bath is determined self - consistently by requiring that projection of the lattice green s function on a single site is identical to the single - site green s function of the anderson model .",

    "in single - site dmft , the self - energy is local ( @xmath30 ) which enables one to transform the integrals over the brillouin zone entering the self - consistency relation into integrals over the non - interacting density of states @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the case of a 3d fcc lattice , there is no analytic form for @xmath31 and its accurate numerical calculation using a monte - carlo binning procedure is cumbersome and only produces a fixed finite numbers of points . on the other hand ,",
    "if we used a lorentzian as an approximation for the delta function , the band - edges and the van - hove singularities would suffer from accuracy problems that could be transferred to the dmft calculation .",
    "we thus performed the calculation with the full @xmath32 space integration .",
    "we devised an adaptive 3d fifth order gaussian quadrature for a cube .",
    "this integration method is explained in appendix  [ appen_integrate ] . for comparisons in calculation of transport properties ,",
    "we have nevertheless calculated @xmath31 using monte carlo integration as explained in appendix  [ mc_function ] .",
    "the resulting non - interacting density of state for the fcc lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping only is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u0 ] .        we have used two `` impurity solvers '' for the auxiliary anderson model .",
    "they are described in the following subsections .",
    "the first method is the numerically exact continuous time quantum monte carlo method ( ctqmc ) @xcite , a finite temperature approach that relies on the monte carlo summation of all diagrams obtained from the expansion of the partition function in powers of the hybridization @xmath33 .",
    "this method does not have a sign problem , and does not have errors associated with time discretization or bath parametrization .",
    "it is therefore exact within statistical errors but computationally expensive .",
    "we refer to the literature for an explanation of the approach@xcite .",
    "we describe the second approach , iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) , in more details since it is the focus of this paper .",
    "ipt is an approximation method that relies on an interpolation from @xmath34 order perturbation theory for the anderson impurity problem @xcite .",
    "the interpolation preserves the correct high - frequency limit for the self - energy and is exact in both the non - interacting and the atomic limits .",
    "we only consider paramagnetic solutions .",
    "the self - energy in this approach is parametrized by @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath33 the hybridization function .",
    "the constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , are chosen such that one recovers the exact solution in the atomic limit as well as the exact result for arbitrary @xmath7 in the high - frequency limit .",
    "the green s function used to obtain the density @xmath43 is @xmath44 in eq .  , @xmath45 is the chemical potential of the lattice that is determined by fixing the value of @xmath43 while @xmath46 is the chemical potential determined by the fictitious density @xmath3 .",
    "we need an additional equation to fix @xmath46 .",
    "this problem has been studied carefully in refs .",
    "setting @xmath47 is not a good option . indeed , as mentioned in the introduction , fixing luttinger s volume works only at very low temperature@xcite .",
    "a widely used approach  @xcite consists in fixing @xmath4 .",
    "we call this approach ipt-@xmath3 .",
    "one can also modify the formula for the interpolated self - energy by requiring that the third moment , appearing in the high - frequency expansion of the green s function , be satisfied exactly . in this case , the deficiencies of ipt-@xmath3 at strong coupling are not as severe .",
    "we will see below that requiring that double - occupancy takes its exact value is an easier solution that does not modify the simplicity of the original scheme and gives accurate results .",
    "ipt can be implemented efficiently , as described in appendix .",
    "[ appen_ipt ] , so that the solution can be obtained in a very short time .",
    "in this section , we first define the physical parameters that will be used to demonstrate the breakdown of ipt-@xmath3 .",
    "then we take advantage of the existence of the exact ctqmc impurity solver to characterize the solution of the dmft equation .",
    "the last subsection demonstrates that for @xmath7 much larger than the bandwidth , ipt-@xmath3 fails to reproduce even qualitatively the exact solution .      at low @xmath11 and finite doping",
    ", it is known that dmft predicts a fermi liquid regime no matter how strong the interaction@xcite . in other words",
    ", a quasiparticle peak always appears at @xmath48 at low @xmath11 except at half - filling when @xmath49 .",
    "we characterize the fermi liquid with three parameters namely the effective chemical potential , @xmath50 the quasiparticle weight , @xmath51 and the scattering rate @xmath52 , where real and imaginary parts are defined by @xmath53 . in the dmft treatment of the hubbard model ,",
    "luttinger s theorem is satisfied at @xmath1 when @xmath54 takes the value of the non - interacting chemical potential that gives the same density .",
    "all of the above parameters are calculated with the self - energy on the real frequency axis and thus , in principle , one needs to perform an analytical continuation from the data in matsubara frequencies and then extrapolate to zero temperature . in practice ,",
    "we calculate the values of the self - energy for a few very low temperatures and use them to extrapolate to zero frequency and zero temperature . for the retarded @xmath55 and @xmath52 we take @xmath56 at the smallest positive @xmath57 for three low temperatures and extrapolate to @xmath1 using the fact that @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , the spectral definitions of the self - energies @xmath60 allow one to prove @xmath61}{\\omega_n}}\\big|_{\\omega_n\\rightarrow 0 } = \\int{\\frac{d\\omega'}{\\pi}}{\\frac{\\sigma(\\omega')}{\\omega'^2 } } = { \\frac{{\\partial}\\sigma'(\\omega)}{{\\partial}\\omega}}\\big|_{\\omega = 0}\\ ] ] which , for a linear dependence of @xmath62 $ ] on @xmath63 , also follows from the cauchy - riemann relation for holomorphic functions of a complex variable .",

    "consider the one - band hubbard model on the fcc lattice , where the single particle dispersion is given by @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we present the dmft results obtained with the ctqmc impurity solver for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , below and above @xmath6 for the mott transition at half - filling .",
    "the bandwidth is @xmath67 for the 3d fcc lattice .",
    "fig.[fig : fermi_ctqmc ] displays the fermi liquid parameters . in fig.[fig : fermi_ctqmc]-(a ) the red solid line shows the non - interacting chemical potential as a function of density . the effective chemical potential @xmath68 is shown with blue circles for @xmath65 and black points for @xmath66 .",
    "the dashed lines indicates the position of the band edges for the 3d fcc lattice . as expected , except at half - filling for @xmath66 , luttinger s theorem is satisfied . in fig.[fig : fermi_ctqmc]-(b ) , the extrapolated scattering rate @xmath69 is negligibly small , except for @xmath66 at @xmath8 . for @xmath65 , (",
    "not shown ) it is of the order @xmath70 and has essentially no density dependance .",
    "the value of @xmath59 , shown in in fig.[fig : fermi_ctqmc]-(c ) , behaves as expected : for @xmath9 , @xmath59 vanishes when the occupation approaches half - filling while it is close to the non - interacting value @xmath71 when the lattice is almost empty or full .",
    "we can also see that even for coupling as large as @xmath66 , the absence of particle - hole symmetry in the dispersion relation still leads to a value of @xmath59 that is not symmetric with respect to half - filling .",
    "clearly , electronic frustration plays an important role in the doped mott insulator .",
    "the ipt equations eqs",
    ".  - do not determine the value of @xmath3 .",
    "as mentioned previously , for @xmath1 the requirement that luttinger s theorem be satisfied ( ipt-@xmath2 ) provides an additional independent equation , except at half - filling for @xmath9 .",
    "however , luttinger s theorem is in general not satisfied at finite temperature and the method becomes inaccurate .",
    "the condition @xmath4 has thus been proposed@xcite ( ipt-@xmath3 ) .",
    "it gives satisfactory results for correlated metals ( not for the insulator at half - filling ) .",
    "the results for the low - temperature extrapolations of @xmath72 and @xmath59 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_ipt ] . below the mott transition , @xmath65 ,",
    "the @xmath4 results ( brown ( @xmath73 ) ) are shown .",
    "one can detect only a very small difference with the solid red line .",
    "luttinger s theorem is thus essentially satisfied .",
    "on the other hand , ipt-@xmath3 for @xmath66 ( kaki ( @xmath74 ) ) gives non - physical results not only@xcite for @xmath10 but , quite generally , close to half - filling .",
    "not only is luttinger s theorem strongly violated , but for a large range of densities , @xmath10 , @xmath54 is outside the band",
    ". many properties of the fermi liquid are proportional to functions of the non - interacting system evaluated at @xmath54 . but these functions are zero outside the band and so if @xmath54 is outside the band we obtain zero . for example",
    ", this would predict an insulator away from half - filling .",
    "the situation is not better for @xmath59 , especially around half - filling where it vanishes for a finite range of densities when @xmath10 .",
    "this demonstrates that at low @xmath11 , when @xmath7 is large , ipt-@xmath3 in its simplest form can not be applied . we must thus search for a new condition to explore this region of parameter space",
    "imposing exact results such as sum - rules , whenever possible , is desirable for any physical theory . whereas the condition @xmath4 is not required by any fundamental principle",
    ", the self - energy must always obey @xmath75 where @xmath76 is double occupancy .",
    "enforcing this consistency condition between single - particle properties , such as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and a two - particle property , @xmath0 , has been successful in other approaches , such as the two - particle - self - consistent theory.@xcite . in the regime of interest here ,",
    "strong coupling , @xmath0 can be accurately estimated and is only very weakly dependent on temperature , as discussed in the following subsection . there , we assess the accuracy of the approach .       for double occupancy @xmath79 plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "we define @xmath80 for fillings @xmath14 and @xmath81 for @xmath10 .",

    "the naive value of @xmath0 is very accurate .",
    "the inset is a zoom for densities @xmath105 . ]    for very large @xmath7 , it is easy to guess that @xmath0 should depend only very weakly on temperature .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath0 can be estimated quite accurately . indeed if @xmath14 there are unoccupied sites in the lattice and since @xmath7 is large , @xmath0 should naively be zero . for @xmath10",
    ", @xmath0 is necessarily non - zero .",
    "if we start from the half - filled , mott insulator , with one electron per site and add electrons , they must go to a site which is already occupied .",
    "thus @xmath0 should simply equal the excess number of electrons measured from half - filling , @xmath106 .",
    "these estimates are called @xmath107 . in reality for @xmath14",
    "there are corrections of order @xmath108 to double occupancy , giving rise to exchange interaction , and @xmath0 is slightly larger than zero . for analogous reasons , @xmath0 for @xmath10",
    "will always be a bit larger than @xmath109 i.e. @xmath110 .",
    "this is obvious for models with particle - hole symmetry , but it will be true as well , even in the absence of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "we can verify our estimates with the ctqmc results for @xmath66 .",
    "within ctqmc , @xmath0 is calculated directly on the impurity by the monte - carlo sampling .",
    "fig.[fig : d_occ ] displays @xmath79 as a function of temperature for different densities .",
    "we see that @xmath79 is small and that the @xmath11 dependence is on the third significant digits .",
    "so , for all practical purposes , we can assume @xmath0 to be independent of @xmath11 although it differs from @xmath107 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 obtained are very close to the naive expectation but always slightly larger . in fig.[fig :",
    "d_occ_n ] we show the double occupancy @xmath0 as a function of the density for three different temperature from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "this figure confirms again that even if we have some dependence on @xmath11 , it is quite small and the result is a fairly simple function of the density .",
    "very similar results have been obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] in the case of a 3d simple cubic lattice .",
    "we thus have a rather simple constraint that we can take into account in ipt to fix all parameters .",
    "we call this approach ipt-@xmath0 . in the next subsection",
    ", we will assess the accuracy of this approach and verify how the results are modified when the exact value of @xmath0 is used instead of the naive one .",
    "we first set @xmath0 to its naive values , i.e zero for @xmath113 and @xmath109 for @xmath10 .",
    "the results for @xmath54 and @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_ipt ] as cyan stars . clearly , the value obtained for @xmath54 is in much better agreement with luttinger s theorem than in the case ipt - n@xmath114 , although it is still incorrect for densities near half - filling .",
    "the biggest improvement is that we avoid values of @xmath54 outside the band .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath59 , ipt-@xmath0 is close to the ctmqc results while for ipt - n@xmath114 it is quite far@xcite from the correct result , leading in particular to an un - physical insulator over a finite range of densities for @xmath10 .",
    "as we now show , one can improve the results further by using an accurate value of @xmath0 . that value can be obtained from a number of methods , in particular ctqmc .",
    "it can be computed quite accurately and does not require a large number of matsubara frequencies . even if ctqmc is available , it may be desirable to use ipt-@xmath0 because the calculation can either be done directly in real frequency or analytically continued from matsubara frequencies using simple methods such as pad approximants@xcite , whereas with ctqmc , maximum entropy@xcite is necessary . in addition , since @xmath0 has negligible temperature dependence in strong coupling , only one value of @xmath0 may be sufficient with ipt-@xmath0 to compute other quantities for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "since @xmath0 is not completely @xmath11 independent , we use an average called @xmath115 calculated between @xmath116 and @xmath103 for the purpose of comparison with the naive approach .",
    "it is calculated from the arithmetic mean of the numerical values of @xmath117 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath117 for each @xmath43 are taken as the arithmetic mean of the last four dmft iterations .",

    "[ fig : fermi_ipt ] as magenta lozenges .",
    "we see that the results for @xmath54 are in excellent agreement with luttinger s theorem except very close to half - filling where it deviates , but not too much .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath59 is not as accurate as that obtained from the naive estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "but if we look at the results for densities between 0.8 and 1.2 , the difference between @xmath118 and @xmath119 is small and constant and @xmath118 correctly extrapolates to zero at half - filling . a small difference in @xmath0",
    "can have a quantitative impact on @xmath59 , without affecting qualitative trends .",
    "for example for @xmath120 , the @xmath0 given by ctqmc is @xmath121 instead of the naive @xmath122 , whereas for @xmath123 , ctqmc gives @xmath124 instead of @xmath125 .",
    "we could imagine that because these quantities are at low @xmath11 , it would be better to take a @xmath0 that is in the low temperature range . if we do this , we obtain a @xmath115 slightly larger .",
    "we then find that @xmath54 is not really affected while @xmath59 is a little bit worse than that obtained from the average @xmath0 over the larger @xmath11 range .",
    "some tuning of @xmath0 would allow us to get a best possible set of @xmath54 and @xmath59 , but that is clearly not the purpose of the exercise . finally , for @xmath52 fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_ipt]-(b ) shows that ipt-@xmath0 is qualitatively correct while being always smaller than ctqmc .",

    "we compare to the ctqmc values obtained from maximum entropy analytical continuation of @xmath127 . that green s function is an average over several converged dmft iterations .",
    "the maximum entropy implementation that was used here is somewhat crude and thus we must not really focus on the details .",
    "the ctqmc results have different errors at different scale , i.e very precise at low @xmath63 , fluctuating at intermediate @xmath63 while at large @xmath63 the results are analytical .",
    "hence , we choose the weight of the entropy term based on heuristic considerations , depending on the real - frequency range we are interested in .",
    "as was noted previously@xcite , in ipt there are states in the mott gap at finite frequency , but their weight is small compared to the states everywhere else , namely near zero frequency and in the lower and upper hubbard band .",
    "overall , ipt with fixed @xmath0 compares well with ctqmc , but , at low temperature , what really matters is the region near @xmath48 .",
    "we thus zoom on this region in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos]-(b ) .",
    "there , we see that in the vicinity of @xmath48 , when @xmath128 , we are quite close to the ctqmc values . when we use the naive @xmath0 , the quasi - particle peak is shifted a little bit to the right and so is this why the low @xmath11 results are different even if the shape and values of the peaks are similar .",
    "we also compare the results for an integrated quantity , @xmath129 , that is obtained in general by solving @xmath130 with @xmath131 the fermi function and @xmath132 the density of states . in our case , this is a byproduct of the dmft calculation .",

    "we continue this process @xmath305 times and divide , at the end , the numbers in the bins by @xmath305 .",
    "the function is thus given by the numbers in the bins , each bin corresponding to a particular energy @xmath159 . accuracy and smoothness can be improved by increasing the number of random points .",
    "for the optical conductivity , we need the current - current correlation function in bosonic matsubara frequencies . in dmft , vertex corrections vanish@xcite , hence we have @xmath306 where @xmath307 are bosonic matsubara frequencies while @xmath63 are fermionic .",
    "to compute this , we again use the convolution theorem and fft , as described for ipt in appendix [ appen_ipt ] .",
    "the above equation can be written as @xmath308 the only difference with eq .",
    "is that here we have bosonic frequencies . using again the cubic spline trick we obtain an expression similar to eq .  .",

    "we also need to go from matsubara frequencies to imaginary time for @xmath317 and for @xmath318 in eq .  .",
    "we proceed to obtain the analog of eq .  .",
    "@xmath319 has a similar structure since the asymptotic behavior of the self - energy is @xmath320 .",
    "this time the poles are at @xmath321 where @xmath322 .",

    "the expressions are @xmath325 @xmath326 @xmath327 @xmath328 we can thus calculate @xmath318 appearing in eq .   and its first derivative at @xmath280 and @xmath281 to find the cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the sum over wave vectors @xmath32 requires some comments . like for the dmft calculation",

    "however , if we look at @xmath318 in eq .  , in principle for each @xmath329 we need to perform the integral over @xmath32 independently , but the whole point of fft is to obtain all @xmath329 points at the same time .",
    "our solution is to launch the integrator for all @xmath329 at the same time and keep in memory the estimate of the integral for each @xmath329 while we refine the estimate .",
    "once the integrator converges for @xmath330 , we conclude that this @xmath32 grid is the one for all @xmath329 and stop the calculation .",
    "since we keep all values in memory , we have the function for all @xmath329 calculated for the grid in @xmath32 space appropriate for @xmath330 .",
    "we verified that by converging the calculation for other values of @xmath329 we obtain the same answer .",
    "we have also tried the other way around , where we interchange the integral over @xmath32 and the fourier transform in eq .  .",
    "in this case , we converge the zero frequency and , once again , the results are essentially the same .",
