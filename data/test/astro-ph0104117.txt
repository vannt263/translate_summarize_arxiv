    "hoii is a gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxy on the outskirts of the m81 group , at a distance of 3.2  mpc ( @xmath1  mag ) .",
    "it was one of the first galaxies outside of the local group where the effects of sequential star formation on the interstellar medium ( ism ) were systematically investigated .",
    "puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) presented high - resolution multi - configuration vla h@xmath0i  observations , revealing a complex pattern of interconnected shells and holes .",
    "they argued for a picture where star formation is self - propagating , photoionization , stellar winds , supernova explosions ( sne ) , and secondary star formation shaping the ism .",
    "while we do not wish here to challenge the general relevance of such scenarios , we will introduce in the next paragraphs numerous problems they face in the particular case of hoii .",
    "some have been pointed out before , but others are highlighted here for the first time or are revealed by our reanalysis of puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) data .",
    "we have reanalyzed puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) multi - configuration vla observations of hoii , keeping only the d - array data . we produced a continuum - subtracted naturally - weighted cube cleaned to a depth of 1@xmath2 ( 2.75  mjy  beam@xmath3 ) , which was used to produce moment maps .",
    "the total h@xmath0i   map is shown in figure  1 , superposed on an optical image . undetected before",
    ", a large but faint component extends over the entire northwest half of the galaxy , encompassing the h@xmath0i  cloud detected by puche et al .",
    "the h@xmath0i   on the southeast side of the galaxy is compressed , giving rise to a striking nw - se asymmetry , and suggesting that hoii may be affected by ram pressure from an intragroup medium ( igm ) .",
    "the h@xmath0i  now reaches over 16  ( 4@xmath4 ) , twice the radius reached previously .",
    "the velocity field shows a clear differentially rotating disk pattern ( with a warp ) in the inner 78 , but the kinematics at larger radii is rather disturbed .",
    "the largest shells are clearly visible as peaks in the velocity dispersion . the total h@xmath0i  flux @xmath5  jy  km  s@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath0i  in figure  1 is reminiscent of ram pressure , but it could also be caused by interactions .",
    "hoii lies 475  kpc in projection from the center of the m81 group , defined by m81 , m82 , and ngc  3077 . at the group velocity dispersion of 110  km",
    "s@xmath3  ( e.g.  huchra & geller 1982 ) , it would take hoii a third of a hubble time to reach the center of the group",
    ". however , hoii appears to be part of subsystem of three dwarf irregular galaxies to the northwest of the group s core , along with kar  52 ( m81  dwarf  a ) and ugc  4483 .",
    "if hoii is interacting , it must be with one of these two galaxies .",
    "both kar  52 and ugc  4483 are much smaller and fainter than hoii and have an irregular optical morphology , but none shows obvious signs of interactions ( bremnes , binggeli , & prugniel 1998 ) . in h@xmath0i , kar  52 displays a lumpy ring with little rotation , incomplete to the nw ( sargent , sancisi , & lo 1983 ) , and ugc  4483 shows a peaked distribution with a faint envelope extended nw - se ( whisp database ) .",
    "the distance to hoii is identical to that of ugc  4483 , but also to that of ngc  2403 and ddo  44 to the sw .",
    "this suggests that hoii belongs to the ngc  2403 subgroup , along with kar  52 , ugc  4483 , ngc  2365 , and ddo  44 .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that the ngc  2403 subgroup is nearer to us by 0.5  mpc but has a larger radial velocity , suggesting that it is moving towards the m81 group at 110 - 160  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "observations of the environment of hoii therefore do not support interactions as a likely mechanism to shape its large - scale structure , and considerations of the m81 and ngc  2403 subgroup as a whole suggest that hoii could have a large velocity relative to a putative igm . ram pressure must therefore be considered a serious candidate to explain the h@xmath0i  morphology of hoii .",
    "observations of the entire region around hoii , kar  52 , and ugc  4483 should help clarify this issue .",
    "the condition for ram pressure stripping can be written as the balance between the pressure exerted by an ambient medium and the restoring force of a galactic disk .",
    "the ism will be stripped if @xmath8 ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , where @xmath9 is the igm density , @xmath10 the relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the igm , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 the total and ism surface densities , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath13  km  s@xmath3  and @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( corrected for other gaseous species ) at the first significantly disturbed contour in figure  1 , we derive a critical density for ram pressure @xmath14  atoms  @xmath15 .",
    "a virial mass of @xmath16  @xmath7  is derived from the five most prominent members of the m81 group ( huchra & geller 1982 ) . spreading 1% of this mass in a sphere just enclosing hoii",
    ", we obtain a mean density of @xmath17  atoms  @xmath15 , 25 times too little for stripping .",
    "although it suffers from many shortcomings , this number provides a benchmark with which to compare more sophisticated calculations .",
    "the igm is likely to be more concentrated and clumpy , and the encounter may not be exactly `` face - on '' , but since the group velocity dispersion estimate is based only on a few large galaxies , it is probably an underestimate , and it is in any case unlikely that the group is virialized at the distance of hoii , making its three - dimensional velocity highly unconstrained .",
    "if hoii is bound to the m81 group , then the virial mass adopted is severely underestimated .",
    "these factors can easily bring the required and derived igm densities within a factor 23 of each other .",
    "more convincingly , typical parameters for poor groups are @xmath18  mpc and @xmath19  @xmath7   ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) , of which only 1020% is associated with individual galaxies , leading to a mean density for the remaining matter of @xmath20  atoms  @xmath15 ( within the virial radius ) . if only 1% of this is ordinary interacting baryonic matter , then its density is sufficient to strip galaxies like hoii of their ism .",
    "this is promising , since on scales of the virial radius , the dominant baryonic mass component in groups is the igm ( mulchaey 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) report x - ray gas masses of @xmath21  @xmath7  for their groups , leading to mean densities for the hot gas of @xmath22  atoms  @xmath15 within the virial radius .    the total x - ray luminosity in groups does not correlate with either the total number of galaxies or the optical luminosity , but it does correlate with the group velocity dispersion and gas temperature .",
    "a common fit to cluster and compact group data yields , for @xmath23  km  s@xmath3 , @xmath24  erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath25  kev ( ponman et al .",
    "a similar correlation for loose groups alone yields @xmath26  erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath27  kev ( helsdon & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "the large errors on @xmath28 are probably related to the wind injection histories of the groups , which also lead to rather flat surface brightness profiles .",
    "there are also indications that the correlations for groups and clusters may be different , so both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are probably underestimates .",
    "there can thus be a substantial amount of hot gas in groups like the m81 group .",
    "another issue of interest is the survival of any stripped gas in the hot igm .",
    "following cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) , the evaporation timescale for a typical cloud ( @xmath30  @xmath15 , @xmath31  pc ) embedded in an igm at the temperatures mentioned above is @xmath32 to @xmath33  yr .",
    "the disturbed ism in hoii extends over @xmath34 in the radial direction . at a velocity of 110  km  s@xmath3",
    ", it takes hoii about @xmath35  yr to cross that distance .",
    "given the strong dependence of the evaporation on the assumed properties of the clouds and igm , the timescales calculated seem consistent with the observations .",
    "it is also possible to show that , in the conditions of interest here , cooling and viscous stripping ( nulsen 1982 ) are negligible compared to evaporation . at the igm density required for ram pressure stripping ,",
    "the cooling timescale is @xmath36  yrs and the timescale for ( complete ) viscous stripping of our typical cloud is @xmath37  yr .",
    "over 50 h@xmath0i  holes were cataloged in hoii by puche et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who obtained estimates of their kinematics ages , previously enclosed h@xmath0i  masses , and creation energies .",
    "many correlations between these quantities are presented , arguing for a formation of the holes through sne and stellar winds , but many are truly a reflection of the properties of hoii rather than of the formation mechanism of the holes .",
    "also , h@xmath38 emission does not preferentially fill small holes or trace the edges of large ones .",
    "a similar picture emerges from far - ultraviolet observations ( stewart et al .",
    "furthermore , the shells are devoid of hot gas , and x - ray emission is not preferentially associated with h@xmath0ii  regions or h@xmath0i  holes ; only a mixed bag of objects is observed ( kerp & walter 2001 ) . the sn rate derived from radio continuum observations agrees well with that derived from the h@xmath0i  shells ( tongue & westpfahl 1995 ) , but the energy is deposited in the central regions of hoii only , hardly helping to explain how the entire web of interconnected shells formed .",
    "furthermore , in most cases where useful limits are derived , stellar clusters expected to remain from massive star formation episodes are simply not seen ( rhode et al .",
    "multi - wavelength observations thus pose a challenge to sne and stellar winds scenarios for the formation of the shells in hoii , particularly in the outer parts of the disk where no star formation appears to be taking place .",
    "other mechanisms exist to explain the formation of the shells and reconcile models with observations ( see rhode et al .",
    "in particular , sn may not be spherically expanding in a uniform ism , as assumed , and the initial mass function could be very top - heavy .",
    "gamma - ray bursts may also be more efficient at creating holes and shells .",
    "all these mechanisms , however , still require massive star formation in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "a fractal h@xmath0i , overpressured h@xmath0ii  regions , external ionization sources , and/or high - velocity clouds can bypass this requirement .    here",
    ", we would like to suggest that ram pressure can provide yet another solution to the problem of shell formation in hoii .",
    "ram pressure can create holes in an h@xmath0i  disk where local minima in the surface density exist .",
    "thus , it can provide an efficient mechanism to enlarge pre - existing holes , created by sne or otherwise , and it can explain the overestimated energy requirements ( or lack of observational signature ) from sne and stellar wind scenarios .",
    "obviously , however , shell formation through ram pressure should be properly modeled before making further claims .",
    "ram pressure should be easy to distinguish from internal , pressure - driven events such as sne and stellar winds , as the shells will have a `` bullet - hole '' geometry similar to that caused by high - velocity cloud collisions ( e.g.  tenorio - tagle 1980 ) .",
    "of course , in the case of hoii , a direct proof of a sufficiently dense igm must also be found before any ram pressure model can be taken seriously ."
