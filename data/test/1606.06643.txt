    "black hole solutions to einstein s equations have provided an excellent arena to test a number of classical and quantum aspects of gravity . in particular , higher dimensional black holes have attracted much attention in last two decades , for instance by the microscopic derivation of bekenstein - hawking entropy  @xcite and the realistic production of black holes at accelerators in the scenario of large extra dimensions  @xcite . in spite of startling developments for higher - dimensional black holes , our understanding of higher dimensional",
    "gravity is still poor since it is much richer and captures more degree of freedom .",
    "according to the topology theorem of a stationary black hole in five dimensions  @xcite , the allowed topology of the cross section of the event horizon is restricted either to a sphere @xmath3 , a ring @xmath4 or lens spaces @xmath5 , provided the spacetime is asymptotically flat and allows two commuting axial killing vector fields ( more generally , the cross section of the stationary horizon must be of positive yamabe - type under the dominant energy condition @xcite ) . in the first two cases , we have the corresponding exact solutions to vacuum einstein s equations  @xcite . in contrast",
    ", a vacuum black hole solution with the lens space topology turns out difficult to come by and is still missing .",
    ", it is not asymptotically flat since the spatial section at infinity has a ` flipped ' lens topology @xmath6 . ] exploiting the inverse scattering method , several authors tried to find an asymptotically flat solution to the five - dimensional vacuum einstein equations , but unfortunately all of these attempts failed  @xcite .",
    "a major obstacle in the construction of a black lens is that the resultant solutions are always plagued by naked singularities .",
    "recently , an asymptotically flat _ supersymmetric _ black lens solution with the topology @xmath7 has been constructed by kunduri and lucietti  @xcite in the framework of the five - dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity ( see @xcite for the extension to @xmath8 supergravity ) .",
    "the construction relies heavily on the machinery developed by gauntlett _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite . in that paper , they generalized the earlier program in @xcite into higher dimensions and demonstrated that the supersymmetric solutions can be systematically classified by using bilinears built out of the killing spinor .",
    "these bilinears define a previledged @xmath9-structures , which tightly constrain the possible forms of the metric and the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the metric of supersymmetric solutions admitting a timelike bilinear killing field is described in an adapted coordinate system by an @xmath10-bundle over the 4-dimensional hyper - khler base space and the governing equations are linear , allowing us to find a number of exact solutions of physical interest .",
    "the program undertaken in  @xcite has replaced the standard ansatz - based approaches and provoked a drastic progress in classifications of bps solutions with various fractions of supersymmetry in diverse supergravities  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach referred to as a spinorial geometry also gives us an elegant and powerful method for classifying supergravity solutions ( see  @xcite for an incomplete list of references ) .",
    "these domains of research have been motivated by the desire to figure out the string duality and the gauge / gravity correspondence .    for the supersymmetric black objects in asymptotically flat spacetimes in the five - dimensional minimal supergravity , a number of properties have been clarified by many authors .",
    "the most salient feature of a supersymmetric black hole is that the horizon must be degenerate and non - rotating .",
    "this is because the bilinear killing vector becomes never spacelike , and hence the ergoregion does not exist  @xcite .",
    "reall gave a proof that the possible topologies of the supersymmetric black holes are either @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 or quotient thereof  @xcite .",
    "for the first case , breckenridge _ et al .",
    "_ constructed a black hole with a spherical topology admitting angular momenta  @xcite , referred to as a bmpv black hole .",
    "the bmpv black hole is characterized by the mass and two equal angular momenta , due to which the spatial symmetry is enhanced to @xmath12  @xcite . as in the kerr case , the magnitude of angular momentum is bounded by the mass , otherwise a naked time machine shows up .",
    "the second possibility corresponding to a black hole with a ring topology @xmath4 has been found in @xcite .",
    "the black ring enjoys only the @xmath13 spatial symmetry and precludes a configuration with equal angular momenta , which distinguish it from the bmpv black hole .",
    "the angular momentum along the @xmath14 direction does not have an upper bound , in sharp contrast to the spherical counterpart .",
    "a more intriguing feature arises in the @xmath8 supergravity , where the three - charge black ring is specified by 7 parameters , while only 5 of them are conserved quantities  @xcite .",
    "this exhibits a classical infinite non - uniqueness of black objects .    ref .",
    "@xcite also proved that the only asymptotically flat black - hole solution to five - dimensional minimal supergravity whose near - horizon geometry is locally isometric to that of bmpv black hole is the bmpv black hole , provided that the bilinear killing field is everywhere timelike outside the killing horizon .",
    "the black lens space found in  @xcite does not counter to the above uniqueness theorem , since the bilinear killing field happens to be null at some points outside the horizon .",
    "these `` critical surfaces '' or `` evanescent ergosurfaces '' @xcite are regular timelike surfaces and provide us with much richer varieties of black holes .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the black hole with a spherical topology other than the bmpv solution indeed exists .",
    "another interesting facet of a black lens in  @xcite and the solution in @xcite is that they have nontrivial 2-cycles outside the horizon .",
    "this kind of `` bubbling '' solutions is of crucial importance in the context of fuzzball conjectures  @xcite , and a number of solitons and black holes / rings with bubbles have been found  @xcite . a key ingredient to bring about these bubbles",
    "is that the spatial hypersurface has nontrivial second homology class , which is not realizable in four dimensions .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the work of kunduri and lucietti  @xcite to the more general lens space , and construct an asymptotically flat supersymmetric black lens solution with the horizon topology of @xmath15 for @xmath16 in the five - dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity .",

    "our strategy is to consider the gibbons - hawking space as a hyper - khler base space and allow the harmonic functions to have @xmath24 point sources with appropriate coefficients . by imposing suitable boundary conditions",
    ", we find the configuration in which the cross section of the horizon becomes @xmath25 and the cross section of null infinity becomes @xmath23 .",
    "our black lens solution possesses nontrivial 2-cycles supported by magnetic fluxes outside the horizon .",
    "one of them touches the horizon and forms the disk topology , while others are away from the horizon .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows . in the next section  [ sec :",
