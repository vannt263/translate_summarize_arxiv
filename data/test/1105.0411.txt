    "complex systems are seldom in equilibrium or even in stationary states ; however , their evolution can in many cases be thought as being composed of spells of quasi - stationarity in which time - varying pseudo - parameters can be considered unchanged .",
    "examples of such framework can be found in finance  @xcite , biology  @xcite , physics  @xcite and physiology  @xcite , just to mention a few areas . by identifying stationary segments",
    ", one can apply standard techniques , e.g. , extracting stochastic equations ( kramers - moyal coefficients ) from data  @xcite , overcoming the difficulties of non - stationary treatments  @xcite . as another application ,",
    "a proper segmentation is important to assess the scenario of mixed statistics  @xcite based on the idea of local equilibrium , typically applied by considering a fixed characteristic scale ( window length ) . in general",
    ", segmentation provides a useful portrait of the local statistical properties for modeling non - stationary systems .    in order to identify such quasi - stationary patches , algorithms based on standard statistical methodology",
    "have been introduced .",
    "explicitly , they lean on moving along the series a pointer to detect the position that maximizes a given quantifier of the statistical discrepancy between the segments on both sides of the pointer . among others  @xcite , worth of mention",
    "are the algorithms based on the student s @xmath0-statistic ( used to test the significance of the null hypothesis of equal means )  @xcite or on the jensen - shannon divergence in the case of symbolic sequences  @xcite .    despite the interesting results provided by these methods  @xcite-@xcite",
    ", limitations hampering the performance can be found in every of them . on the one hand , in the statistical moments criteria",
    "there is the problem of boiling down the existence of non - stationarity to the change of pre - established local quantities .",
    "for instance , even if the time series presents fluctuations in the variance , the @xmath0-test may give us the indication that the series is stationary .",
    "although it could be improved through the unequal variance @xmath0-test statistic or also through an @xmath1-test , it will still rely on assumptions over the moments and on the validity of the central limit theorem . on the other hand , entropy based methods",
    "are more fitted to symbolic sequences , while information is lost if discretizing a real valued series by means of thresholds .",
    "moreover , the segmentation stopping criteria can be deemed arbitrary .",
    "its proposed improvement by means of the bayesian information criterion can be disputed as well since such a criterion often favors minimalist modeling  @xcite . with the aim of surmounting those difficulties ,",
    "we introduce a _ fully _ non - parametric segmentation approach by using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic , @xmath2 , which measures the maximal distance between the cumulative distributions of two samples , as estimate of the discrepancy between segments .",
    "note that it allows to test whether two samples come from the same distribution with no need to specify which is the common distribution .",
    "our algorithm ( named ks - segmentation ) works as follows . given a segment of a time series , @xmath3 , a sliding pointer , at @xmath4 ,",
    "is moved in order to compare the two fragments @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the position @xmath7 of the pointer is moved so that the sizes of the two segments ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are at least unitary",
    ". then , one selects the position @xmath10 that maximizes the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic @xmath11 , between the two patches @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ".    once found the position @xmath10 of the maximal distance @xmath14 , @xmath15 , one checks the statistical significance ( at a chosen significance level @xmath16 ) of a potentially relevant cut at @xmath10 by comparison with the result that would be obtained was the sequence random  @xcite .",
    "the potential cut ticks the first stage if @xmath15 exceeds its critical value , @xmath17 , for the selected significance level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : critical ] and further technical details in app .  [ app ] ) . before final acceptance of the cut",
    ", one can still require a minimal size ( number of points ) @xmath18 , namely , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the procedure is then recursively applied starting from the full series @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of data points , until no segmentable patches are left .",
    "the search for @xmath15 within a given segment @xmath23 during the iterations , as well as in the determination of the critical curves , is performed for @xmath24 .",
    "the outcome of this segmentation procedure when applied to paradigmatic non - stationary time series is hereafter presented .",
    "we first survey the segmentation of heart - rate ( rr ) series , which motivated the introduction of the segmentation algorithm based on the discrepancy of the means ( mean - based algorithm )  @xcite and that have also been suggested as a common focus to solve the controversy over the potential chaoticity of normal heart rate  @xcite .",
    "namely , we revisit the study of interbeat time series from healthy individuals ( ` nor ` ) and patients with congestive heart failure ( ` chf ` )  @xcite .",
    "time series ( tagged ` n1nn - n5nn ` and ` c1nn - c5nn ` for ( ` nor ` ) and ( ` chf ` ) , respectively ) are about 24 hours long and had their outliers removed .",
    "the segmentation outcome is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rr - series ] .",
    "we computed the first moments for each resulting segment .",
    "the variance is deemed not constant throughout segments , but it is dispersed over more than one decade as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] , for all segment sizes .",
    "the local variance is larger for the healthy subjects .",
    "thence , equal variance can not be assumed as in previous analysis of heart - rate series  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our finding implies that if one keeps such a simpler analysis , at least the effective degrees of freedom in the @xmath0-test should be obtained by the welch - sattherthwaite equation .",
    "it is worth referring that despite the tendency for the variance to be larger in the ` nor ` group , the quotient for consecutive segments is very similarly distributed in both groups , with a slow power - law decay ( with exponent close to -3 ) ( not shown ) .",
    "the complementary cumulative distributions of segment sizes for ` nor ` and ` chf ` individuals are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nor_chf ] . for both groups",
    ", the plots can be described by a double exponential @xmath25 with characteristic lengths @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence there is no indication of a scale - free behavior , as suggested by previous segmentation analysis through the mean - based algorithm  @xcite .     with amplitude and characteristic lengths @xmath28 ( 0.78,78,372 ) and ( 0.86,64,373 ) respectively . ]",
    "our next example concerns the scenario of mixed statistics that has been applied to the study of fluid turbulence  @xcite .",
    "besides turbulence , its relevance is highlighted by the fact that several models for finance have been inspired by this physical problem  @xcite .",
    "succinctly , the mixed approach corresponds to a conjecture where one has a classical boltzmann - gibbs statistics , conditioned to given temperature ( @xmath29 ) , which signals the existence of local equilibrium , that is associated with certain distribution @xmath30 .",
    "nonetheless , up to now , the approaches to the problem have considered the existence of a _ single scale _ of local equilibrium , which can be seen as a first step for an outright description  @xcite .",
    "endowed with our segmentation algorithm , we are in position to evaluate the distribution of local time scales , @xmath31 , of the @xmath32 factor and verify the local equilibrium assumption in this type of system .",
    "as example , we consider a series of wind velocities ( one month of measurements at a 30s acquisition interval )  @xcite .",
    "we reduced the strong daily periodicity by scaling the data by the average at each time of the day .",
    "then velocity @xmath33 is dimensionless .",
    "accordingly , in a segment within which local equilibrium holds , the velocity distribution is defined by @xmath34 $ ] , wherefrom the distribution of the speed , @xmath35 , is @xmath36 $ ] . along these lines , we apply our segmentation procedure pitching at detecting the time intervals where the local equilibrium approximation is valid .",
    "the result of the segmentation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - series ] .",
    "the complementary cumulative distribution of segments decays more slowly than exponentially ( plausibly a stretched or double exponential , the latter with characteristic times of 32 min and 93 min ) .",
    "the distribution of segment lengths has mean ( standard deviation ) approximately equal to 129 ( 91 ) points ( corresponding to 64 ( 45 ) min approx . ) .",
    "one observes in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] that the 2d - maxwell distribution fails in describing the distribution of velocities , because the local variance is dispersed ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "then we considered the mixing @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the maxwell distribution defined above , substituting @xmath39 , given that the ( conditioned ) raw moments are @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "one observes that the mixed distribution is in good accord with the data distribution , once local trends are removed .",
    "the mixed distribution also agrees with the histogram built from artificial series obtained by juxtaposition of sequences of maxwellian random numbers , with the same length and local variance as the real ones .",
    "afterwards , we have computed the local variance that is proportional to the inverse @xmath32 factor .",
    "its distribution , presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] , is responsible for the deviation of @xmath41 from the 2d - maxwell distribution ( main frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "besides , the speed , @xmath42 , we also looked at angle variations ( at 30s lag ) .",
    "while a more quantitative analysis on this matter is addressed to future work , here we would like to call attention to the fact that , even if the average value is constantly close to zero , changes in the local variance are detected by the present method , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : series - angle ] , while no segmentation occurs with the procedure based on the discrepancy of the means .",
    "in this manuscript we have presented a segmentation method which aims at coping with non - stationary signals from widespread physical and non - physical systems where the local - equilibrium or local - stationarity hypotheses hold .",
    "our method , which is based on the kolmogorov - smirnov test , improves previous proposals as soon as it is non - parametric and thus independent of any pre - assumed order of fluctuation between the stationary segments , resulting into a more flexible and effectual algorithm .",
    "concerning algorithmic complexity , our algorithm is more efficient than methods based on matrix diagonalization , such as principal component analysis . in comparison with moment",
    "based segmentation proposals , our algorithm requires sorting segments of length @xmath43 which increases the complexity in a factor of order @xmath44 , which does not represent a significant larger computational cost , despite the enhanced ability .",
    "the applicability of our proposal was then tested with two poles apart signals , heart - rate intervals and wind velocities , with significant results in each case . in the first case ,",
    "the non - stationarity portrait is altered with respect to that of previous analysis based on the discrepancy of the means , as soon as the local variance can not be assumed constant . in the second , the procedure is shown to be useful to detect meaningful windows to compute local statistical quantities . in general , proper segmentation is helpful in several problems where local - stationarity applies .    [ [ app ] ]      we determined @xmath15 numerically for a large number ( @xmath45 ) of sequences of @xmath22 i.i.d .",
    "gaussian numbers and built its cumulative distribution . from the cumulative distribution , we obtained the critical values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , for each given significance level @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting critical curves are shown in figure  [ fig : critical ] . for the significance tests applied throughout the segmentation procedure",
    ", we used the effective form of the critical curves given by the heuristic simple expression @xmath48 with @xmath49 equal to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "we noticed that , along a random series , the position @xmath56 for which @xmath14 is maximal is not uniform but presents a u - shaped distribution .",
    "this could set forth a bias in the cutting performance propping up an increase in the number of short segments .",
    "let us mention that in the mean - based algorithm an alike u - shape is also present . to avoid this effect , we tested a redefinition of the standard ks distance , by considering @xmath57 , with arbitrary @xmath58 and observed that the flattest ( more uniform ) distribution of @xmath10 , for any size @xmath22 , occurs for @xmath59 .",
    "we compared the implementation of the algorithm both values of @xmath58 ( 0.5 and 0.64 ) , however , both for real and artificial series no significant differences in the segmentation portrait were observed .",

    "however , when applying this or other algorithm , it may be convenient to perform ad - hoc test , depending on the particular statistical characteristics of the analyzed series .      for the analyzed series , we checked the robustness of the results with respect to the significance level ( @xmath78 ) .",
