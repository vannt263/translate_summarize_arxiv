    "few years ago we investigated motion of a wave packet ( wp ) representing a fermion in the harmonic oscillator potential with spin - orbit coupling . in this model ( and non - relativistic approach ) we have found the _ spin - orbit pendulum _ phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we predicted there that spin - orbit forces creates interesting oscillations of expectation values of spin components if particle state is prepared as a well localized wave packet .",
    "then expectation values of the spin and angular momentum components oscillate periodically . during one period of this time evolution ,",
    "the spin collapses ( at the same time the wave function initially pure in both subspaces gets maximum entanglement ) then ( almost ) restores in the opposite direction , collapses again and restores exactly .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the model to relativistic wps , focusing on cases corresponding to linear classical trajectories of a particle ( the other interesting case of circular trajectories is discussed elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "the relativistic harmonic oscillator has been introduced many years ago in particle physics @xcite and then refreshed @xcite under the name _ dirac oscillator _ ( do ) .",
    "more recently the behavior of the wps in do was studied in both dirac and foldy - wouthuysen ( f - w ) representations in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "do is described by the time dependent equation : @xmath0 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 are usual dirac matrices .",
    "one can show that both the large and small component of an do eigenstate are proportional to @xmath2  an eigenstate of the 3d - ho with a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the energy spectrum has the form of @xmath3 the parameter @xmath4 enables , if it is small enough , a transition to the non - relativistic limit .",
    "we study the evolution of a gaussian wp which is initially centered at @xmath5 and has the average momentum @xmath6 ( i.e. a 3d - ho coherent state ) .",
    "moreover , the initial wp is an eigenstate of the spin pointed at some arbitrary direction defined by two numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 } \\ ,",
    "\\pmatrix { \\alpha \\cr \\beta \\cr 0 \\cr 0 } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 . in the following",
    "we present the time evolution of _ linear _ wp ( [ gauss ] ) corresponding to the following initial conditions : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is possible thanks to decomposition @xcite : @xmath13 time evolution --------------    fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the behavior of spin averages for the linear wp in the dirac representation .",
    "the transition from the pure state of the spin in a well - defined direction to the entangled state is particularly clear in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "the initial conditions are such that wp is launched along @xmath15 axis from the center with spin parallel to @xmath16 .",
    "notice the _ zitterbewegung _ and and deviation from periodicity for the relativistic case .",
    "an example of the spatial wp motion is shown in fig .",
    "the probability density is shown on @xmath17 plane ( there is cylindrical symmetry with respect to @xmath15 axis ) .",
    "sub - packets corresponding to states of positive and negative energies are well seen in dirac representation , whereas only positive energy states are present in the f - w representation .",
