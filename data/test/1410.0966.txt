    "gravitational wave ( gw ) observations are expected to provide a new view of relativistic phenomena in the universe .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for the direct detection of gws is the merger of compact binaries such as binary neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "the second generation of ground - based gw detectors , such as advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite , will reach the sensitivity required to detect gws from the inspiral and coalescence of compact binary systems including binary nss within a few hundred mpc .",
    "statistical studies suggest that a few tens of merger events should be observed per year @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic counterparts of gw emitters have been recently focused on to maximize a scientific return from the expected detection of gws ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "follow - up observations of these electromagnetic counterparts are important to confirm a gw detection and to investigate progenitors and environments .",
    "the electromagnetic detection also improves the localization of gw sources because the localization accuracy by photons is much better than that by the ground - based gw detectors @xmath1 deg@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sophisticated simulations have revealed mass ejection associated with the mergers of binary nss by several mechanisms .",
    "significant mass is dynamically ejected by gravitational torques and hydrodynamical interactions during the mergers , called dynamical ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "general relativistic simulations show that these ejecta distribute nearly isotropic compared to newtonian simulations in the cases of binary nss @xcite , while they are anisotropic for ns - black hole ( bh ) mergers @xcite .",
    "mass may be also ejected through winds driven by neutrinos @xcite , magnetic fields of and/or amplified by the merged objects @xcite , viscous heating and nuclear recombination @xcite .",
    "a traditional electromagnetic counterpart is short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent simulations have revealed that a hypermassive ns is formed from the merger of a ns binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is believed to collapse into a bh at later time .",
    "non - collapsed matter and some ejecta falling back to the bh form a torus around the bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "then , a relativistic jet may be launched from the bh - torus system , which is believed to be the central engine of short - hard grbs .",
    "another interesting possibility is a so - called macronova / kilonova , which is thermal emission from ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radiative energy of a macronova is estimated between that of a classical nova and supernova .",
    "ejecta can also produce non - thermal emission at later time similarly to supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "ejecta may accompany an advanced relativistic part , producing early emission ( @xmath3 hours ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "emission from macronovae and ns binary merger remnants is almost isotropic and hence different from that of short grbs which depends on the directions of their relativistic jets .",
    "moreover , macronovae are closer in time to mergers than emission from merger remnants and do not depend on the properties of circumburst environments .",
    "therefore , macronovae are expected to play a crucial role to localize a large sample of gw events @xcite .",
    "recently , a macronova candidate following grb 130603b was discovered @xcite .",
    "this candidate is widely interpreted as the results of the radioactive decay of @xmath0-process elements produced in the ejecta of a compact binary merger @xcite .",
    "we call this scenario _ an @xmath0-process model _ throughout this paper .",
    "the ejecta from a merger of binary nss is primarily neutron - rich .",

    "although the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis ends a few hundred millisecond after a merger , synthesized elements release energy due to nuclear fission and beta decays up to @xmath5 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a schematic picture for this model is shown in the left panel of figure [ figure : model ] .",
    "if this scenario is correct , the observations also give important insights into the enrichment of @xmath0-process elements in the galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the @xmath0-process model explains the observed light curve of the macronova , it is based on the limited observational data and the nuclear heating rate with large uncertainties .",
    "required mass of dynamical ejecta to explain the observations is relatively large compared with the simulation results @xcite .",
    "in addition , the occurrence of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis needs the ejecta with low electron fraction ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , relatively high electron fraction ( @xmath7 ) can be also realized , which has been discussed for neutrino - driven wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth considering other possibilities such as the scenarios of an external shock between ejecta and surrounding medium @xcite , a supramassive magnetar @xcite and dust grains @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we consider another power source of macronovae , i.e. , energy injection from the activity of the central engine , in addition to the radioactive decay of @xmath0-process elements .",
    "this is similar to the early evolution of core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we call this model _ an engine model _ throughout this paper",
    ". there are several motivations to consider that the activity of the central engine contributes to the heating of ejecta .",
    "one observational motivation is the extended emission following the prompt emission of short grbs .",
    "the origin of extended emission is considered to be the activity of the central engine @xcite because the sharp drop of its light curve is difficult to be reproduced by afterglow emission @xcite . after the merger , a stable ns or a bh is formed . in the case",
    "that a bh with a torus ( or disk ) is formed , the energy injection to the ejecta is expected as a form of the jet and/or disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case that a ns with strong poloidal magnetic field is formed as a result of a merger , the wind of relativistic particles is ejected @xcite .",
    "then , the wind collides with the ejecta , and about half of the wind energy converts to the internal energy by the shock - heating .",
    "a schematic picture is shown in the right - hand side of figure [ figure : model ] .    the ejecta emission powered by a stable magnetar",
    "has already been discussed @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the magnetar - powered ejecta emit the brighter optical and x - ray emissions than that of the @xmath0-process model .",
    "however , they did not show that the magnetar - powered ejecta explain the detected infrared excess in grb 130603b @xcite .",
    "the engine model can provide energy enough to reproduce the detected macronova candidate , grb 130603b .",
    "we do not specify the specific heating sources .",
    "alternatively , to estimate the luminosity and temperature , we assume that the internal energy @xmath8 erg is injected to the ejecta at the time @xmath9 s after the merger . these values are consistent with typical isotropic energy @xmath10 erg and duration @xmath11 s of the extended emission @xcite . using the velocity of the ejecta @xmath12 , the temperature at @xmath13 is @xmath14^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath15 is the radiative constant .",
    "if we only consider the adiabatic cooling for the cooling process of the ejecta , the evolution of the internal energy @xmath16 and temperature @xmath17 is scaled as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the luminosity is described as @xmath20 . adopting the ejecta velocity @xmath21 cm s@xmath22 @xcite , the luminosity @xmath23 and the temperature @xmath17 at @xmath24s are @xmath25 and @xmath26 the observations of macronova of grb 130603b give j - band luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath22 and the difference between j - band and b - band @xmath28 mag which corresponds to the temperature @xmath29 k at @xmath30 days after grb 130603b in the source rest frame @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this estimate , the luminosity and temperature for the engine model is consistent with the observation of the macronova following grb130603b .",
    "we model the evolution of luminosity and temperature of a macronova . unlike the previous studies , we treat the model in an analytical manner and formulate a light curve including the early phase ( @xmath31 s ) , which is important for the search of electromagnetic counterparts of gw emitters .",
    "we consider shock - heating due to the activity of a central engine as a heating mechanism of the ejecta .",
    "for comparison , the @xmath0-process model , which has been discussed in most papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is also formulated .",
    "then , we compare the results of our models with observations to constrain the model parameters such as the ejected mass and the velocity of the ejecta . although our models are simplified , it is valuable to make comparison between two heating models . in section [ model ] , we introduce our model assumptions .",
    "we describe the analytical models for the evolution of luminosity and temperature in section [ evolution ] .",
    "then , we compare our results with observations in section [ discuss ] .",
    "implications for the discrimination between two models are also discussed .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ summary ] . in appendix",
    "a , we summarize the formulae for the observed temperature and bolometric luminosity .",
    "significant mass of material @xmath32 is ejected during a binary merger .",
    "we model ejecta by following the results of the general relativistic simulations of ns - ns mergers in @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that ejecta expand in a nearly homologous manner ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the morphology of the ejecta is quasi - spherical in the case of a merger of binary nss .",
    "according to these results , we assume an isotropic and homologous expansion for the ejecta . then , the velocity of ejecta @xmath12 is @xmath33 where the radius @xmath0 originates the central engine and the time @xmath34 is measured from the time when a compact binary merges .",
    "note that in the case of a merger of ns - bh binary , the ejected mass expands with significant anisotropy @xcite .",
    "we do not consider such anisotropic ejecta in this work .",
    "@xcite found that the profile of ejecta obtained from simulations by @xcite can be well fitted by a power - law function @xmath35 .",
    "the power - law index of snapshot density @xmath36 is more or less independent on the dynamics of mergers , which is in the range of @xmath374 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the velocities of the outer and inner edges of the ejecta , respectively .",

    "our main aim is to compare two models for energy sources , so that our conclusions are not affected . in section [ outer ] , we discuss the dependence on the mass density profile at the outer region of the ejecta for the observed light curve . here",
    ", we only consider the evolution after the initial stage of the merger ( @xmath47 ) and treat @xmath43 as a model parameter .",
    "because of homologous expansion , the density decreases as @xmath48 .",
    "then , the density profile is described by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are normalization factors .",
    "the factor @xmath52 is related to the total mass of the ejecta @xmath53 as following , @xmath54,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath55 from equation ( [ sec2:v ] ) .",
    "we also introduce the radius of ejecta outer edge @xmath56 and their inner edge @xmath57      the inner part of the ejecta is optically thick , and therefore the propagation of radiation in the ejecta can be regarded as a diffusion process .",
    "photons can diffusively escape from the region which satisfies that the diffusion time , @xmath58 , is smaller than the dynamical time @xmath34 , @xmath59 the medium in this region is called to be effectively thin @xcite .",
    "for convenience , we introduce a diffusion radius @xmath60 which is the radius satisfying the condition @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we divide ejecta into two regions called the effectively thin ( @xmath62 ) and effectively thick ( @xmath63 ) regions . near the diffusion radius ,",
    "the optical depth is @xmath64 .",
    "we consider random walk for photons so that the mean number of scatterings to propagate for the distance @xmath65 is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the mean free path for a photon .",
    "hence , the diffusion time @xmath58 for the propagation distance @xmath65 is @xmath68 in the right hand of equation ( [ sec2 - 1:t_diff ] ) , we use @xmath69 .",
    "we calculate the diffusion radius @xmath70 from the condition @xmath71 .",
    "since the mass density profile of the ejecta is described by a decreasing power - law function ( equation [ sec2 - 1:rho ] ) , the diffusion time @xmath58 is negligible in an outer part .",
    "thus , in order to calculate the diffusion radius @xmath70 , it is a good approximation to only consider scatterings near @xmath70 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , in the early phase , the distance from the outer edge of the ejecta @xmath73 to the diffusion radius @xmath70 is smaller than the diffusion radius @xmath74 . therefore , we should take the propagation distance as @xmath75 we call the first the thin - diffusion phase and the second the thick - diffusion phase throughout this paper .",
    "we schematically show these two phases in figure [ figure : diffuse ] .",
    "note that in the thin - diffusion phase , since the size of the effectively thin region is much smaller than the size of the ejecta ( @xmath76 ) , the calculation of the radiative transfer using monte carlo technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) requires a large number of realizations to follow the temporal evolution , which do not seem to have been considered properly so far .    to obtain the diffusion radius ,",

    "our model is based on the formulation of the light curves of supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but there are several differences . in the case of type ii supernovae , the opacity is significantly reduced due to hydrogen recombination ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the ionization potentials of the lanthanides included in the @xmath0-process elements are generally lower than that of hydrogen and the iron group , the opacity remains high at relatively low temperature @xcite .",

    ".    as far as we know , the supernova studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have not taken into account the thin - diffusion phase , which is necessary for treating the thickness of the diffusion length appropriately and estimating the physical quantities by the values at the outer edge of the ejecta in the analytical formulae",
    ". this phase may be also important for the case of supernovae .",
    "some supernova studies consider the planar phase @xcite in which the evolution of the ejecta is approximately planar as long as its radius do not double . in the case of the ns - ns merger ,",
    "since the initial length scale of the merger system is small @xmath84 cm and the velocity of the merger ejecta is subrelativistic , the planar phase is irrelevant for the observations .",
    "one of the two heating mechanisms we consider is nuclear heating by @xmath0-process elements .",
    "since the beta decay products of @xmath0-process elements produced in ns binary mergers naturally heat ejecta , this mechanism is considered to power the emission of a macronova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the value of @xmath89 has been obtained by simulations under some simplified assumptions with only limited parameter regions .",

    "the injected internal energy by the nuclear decay is @xmath91 in the region @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the injected energy in this region is decreased by adiabatic cooling .",
    "the time - evolution of internal energy due to the adiabatic cooling is proportional to @xmath92 . comparing the two temporal evolution , the index of the adiabatic cooling is smaller than that of the increase of internal energy due to the nuclear decay for @xmath93 .",
    "since we use @xmath87 , we neglect the injected internal energy in the region @xmath63 .",
    "unlike the @xmath0-process model , energy injection occurs only within the time @xmath13 in the engine model .",
    "we only consider adiabatic cooling as a cooling process of ejecta after @xmath13 , and therefore , the temperature distribution at time @xmath34 is , @xmath94 where the index @xmath95 is a parameter for a snapshot distribution and @xmath96 is a normalization factor described later .",

    "then , only the inner part of the ejecta will be heated .",
    "for comparison , we also show the light curves in the @xmath0-process model with the parameter set of the hot interior in figure [ figure : observation2 ] as dashed lines .",
    "the luminosity of the @xmath0-process model exceeds the observed upper limits in two observations , grb 050509b and grb 080905a ( left and middle panels of figure [ figure : observation2 ] ) if we choose the parameter set of the hot interior model .",
    "we are not able to find any parameter set in the @xmath0-process model , which simultaneously satisfies the observed limits of the three observations .",
    "note that we do not argue that the @xmath0-process model is excluded from these results because we need to take into account the variations of the model parameters for each event .",
    "note that the extended emission was not detected in three short grbs .",
    "however , it is not unreasonable to miss the extended emission of these bursts .",
    "one possibility is a selection effect .",
    "observationally , the fraction of short grbs with extended emission is significantly larger at softer energy bands : @xmath325% in the swift bat samples ( @xmath26715 kev ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath37% in the batse samples ( @xmath26720 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that observations with a low energy threshold may dramatically increase short grbs with extended emission @xcite .",
    "this will be further tested by future soft x - ray survey facilities such as wide - field maxi ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) @xcite .",
    "the three referred short grbs were detected by swift bat and therefore swift bat could not detect extended emission by chance . alternatively , the outflow following the main short grb jet could not breakout the ejecta . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the propagation of jets in merger ejecta .",
    "they found the cases that relativistic jets can penetrate merger ejecta and produce the prompt emission of short grbs , but in the late energy injection cases , outflow fails to breakout the ejecta .",

    "we also plot the observational data from @xcite.,width=302 ]    in the thin - diffusion phase , the light curve strongly depends on the density profile of the ejecta surface .",
    "the density profile is determined by the complex merger dynamics @xcite , so that the density profile of the ejecta can not be analytically derived as mentioned in section 2.3 .",
    "since the outer part of the density profile is difficult to calculate precisely , little attention has paid on the mass profile at the outer region in current numerical simulations . in order to investigate the dependence of the light curve on the mass profiles in the thin - diffusion phase , we consider other forms of the mass profile and compare the light curve with that of equation ( [ sec2 - 1:rho ] ) .",
    "we adopt an exponential profile @xmath270 we introduce an additional free parameter @xmath271 and the ejecta expand @xmath272 .",
    "the calculations are the same except for using @xmath273 .",
    "we fix the mass with velocity larger than @xmath274 and calculate three models for @xmath275 . for the other parameters , we adopt from the fiducial parameter set in table 1 .",
    "we show the results in the @xmath0-process model in figure [ figure : exp_comp ] .",
    "since we fix the mass with velocity larger than @xmath274 , the bolometric luminosities at the time @xmath276 are almost the same values . in the thin - diffusion phase ( @xmath277 ) , both the luminosity and the temperature are smaller than the fiducial model .",
    "this is because the density at the front of the ejecta is reduced in this mass profile .",
    "since the maximum velocity effectively becomes large and the adiabatic cooling becomes efficient , these effects for luminosity and temperature should be also seen in the engine model .",
    "we conclude that the luminosities in the thin - diffusion phase ( @xmath277 ) have uncertainties at least with @xmath278 mag , which originates from the uncertainty of the outermost mass profile .",
    "note that the emission from the ejecta with the mass profile discussed here reduces the tension between the light curve in the @xmath0-process model and the upper limits of the deep optical observations ( grb 050509 and grb 080905a ) as discussed in section [ other ] . especially , the optical luminosity in the case @xmath279 ( thin - dot - dashed line ) significantly decreases after @xmath280 s. therefore , the ejecta with relatively shallow mass distribution at the front of the ejecta is able to explain the current optical follow - up observations in the @xmath0-process model .      in the fiducial parameter set ,",
    "the light curves for two models in the optical and infrared bands are similar ( figure [ figure : observation ] ) . in figure",
    "[ figure : parameter ] , the allowed parameter region to explain the observation of grb 130603b for both models are also overlapped .",
    "recall that emission from ejecta is described as blackbody radiation for the two models , whose spectrum is narrow in bands .",
    "therefore , no excess at other wavelengths is expected and also the prediction is consistent with radio observations @xcite . therefore , it is difficult to discriminate two models from the currently available observational data .    in the @xmath0-process model ,",
    "the light curve with mass profile @xmath35 ( @xmath281 ) and a parameter set which explains the infrared excess detected from grb 130603b can not explain the upper limits obtained from the deep optical observations of some short grbs .",
    "therefore , if both stringent optical upper limits at @xmath226 s and bright infrared emission at @xmath84 s are simultaneously obtained from a single event ( with a difference larger than two magnitudes @xmath282 mag ) , the @xmath0-process model is significantly restricted .",
    "for the engine model , these observations give a constraint for the temperature distribution in the ejecta , which may give new insights into the activity of the central engine .    as shown in the middle panel of figure [",
    "figure : evolution ] , the bolometric luminosity in the @xmath0-process model from the whole ejecta ( blue long - dashed line ) , including low temperature and/or x - rays and @xmath194-rays produced directly in radioactive decays @xcite , declines more gradually than that for the engine model .",
    "this is because there is no energy injection after the time @xmath283 for the engine model .",
    "then , the luminosity significantly decreases when photons at the inner edge of the ejecta begin to diffuse out ( see the middle panel of figure [ figure : evolution ] and figure [ figure : observation ] ) .",
    "the luminosity from the whole ejecta can be described as @xmath193 in the transparent phase .",
    "the index of time @xmath34 is determined by the nuclear heating rate , @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , the two models are distinguishable by observing the temporal evolution of bolometric luminosity from the whole ejecta in this phase .",
    "we calculated the light curves of macronovae by developing analytical models .",
    "we modeled the ejecta based on the results of numerical simulations for a merger of binary nss .",
    "in addition to the nuclear decay of @xmath0-process elements ( the @xmath0-process model which is often discussed ) , we considered another heating mechanism for the ejecta , the engine - driven shock ( engine model ) .",
    "we compared the results with the optical and infrared observations of the first macronova candidate associated with grb 130603b , and showed that both models can explain the observations . in order to reproduce the observed light curve",
    ", the @xmath0-process model requires relatively large ejecta mass @xmath285 which is mainly determined by the observed infrared luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath22 at @xmath84 s. in the engine model , the internal energy of ejecta , which mainly determines the observed luminosity , does not depend on the ejecta mass . then",
    ", unless the entire of the ejecta is effectively thin ( the diffusion time is smaller than the dynamical time , @xmath286 , at the inner edge of the ejecta ) , s in the engine model , the luminosity rapidly decreases after the time @xmath287 when photons can diffuse out from the inner edge of the ejecta ( section [ transparent ] ) . ]",
    "the required ejecta mass is @xmath237 , which is comparable to the recent numerical simulation results .",
    "the initial internal energy @xmath97 and the injection time @xmath13 are required as @xmath288 , which is consistent with the observed extended emission of short grbs , @xmath10 erg and @xmath11 s. the required minimum velocity is about @xmath289 for both models , which is mainly determined by the constraint for the observed temperature @xmath29 k at @xmath84 s. for the range of the opacity @xmath250 cm@xmath2 g@xmath22 , it is difficult for both models to explain the observations of macronova associated with grb 130603b by the ejecta mass less than @xmath241 .",
    "if macronovae are identical , the upper limits on the luminosity obtained in the deep optical observations of other short grbs give stringent constraints on the @xmath0-process model . on the other hand ,",
    "the engine model satisfies these constraints if the temperature profile is centrally concentrated in the ejecta ( large @xmath95 ) .",
    "thus , if the difference between the optical magnitude at @xmath226 s and the infrared magnitude at @xmath84 s is larger than @xmath290 mag in a single event , the @xmath0-process model is difficult to explain the observations unless the front of the ejecta has much shallow mass distribution .",
    "another difference in the light curves between two models is the bolometric luminosity at the transparent phase when dynamical time is smaller than the diffusion time at the inner edge of the ejecta @xmath198 .",
    "although the optical and infrared luminosities rapidly decrease in the transparent phase , the bolometric luminosity from the whole ejecta , including lower frequency than near - infrared band and/or x - rays and @xmath194-rays produced directly in radioactive decays , is determined by the energy injection rate of nuclear decay , @xmath291 . for the engine model , the bolometric luminosity decreases rapidly in this phase ( faster than @xmath292 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the light curve of the bolometric luminosity from the whole ejecta can distinguish between two heating mechanisms .",
    "our results show that early light curves depend on the density profile of the outermost edge of the ejecta .",
    "it is necessary to develop a method to calculate the low - density region of the ejecta in either the analytical or numerical ways in order to precisely predict the early light curves of macronovae .",
