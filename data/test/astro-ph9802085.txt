    "as very few gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources have astronomical counterparts at other wavebands , empirical studies of grbs have been largely restricted to the analysis of their gamma ray properties : bulk properties such as fluence and spectral hardness , and evolution of these properties within a burst event ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) . while bursts exhibit a vast range of complex temporal behaviors , their bulk properties appear simpler and amenable to straightforward statistical analyses .",
    "studies fall into two categories : examination of whether grb bulk properties comprise a homogeneous population or are divided into distinct classes ; and search for relationships between bulk properties",
    ". both types of study may lead to astrophysical insight , just as the distinction between main sequence stars and red giants and the measurement of a luminosity - mass relation along the main sequence assisted the development of stellar astrophysics early in the century .",
    "the most widely accepted taxonomy of grbs is the division between short - hard and long - soft bursts proposed by dezalay et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and kouveliotou et al .",
    "( 1993 , henceforth k93 ) . k93 noticed a bimodality in the burst duration variable @xmath1 ( time within which 90% of the flux arrived ) , suggesting the presence of two distinct types of bursts separated at @xmath2 sec .",
    "the short bursts have systematically harder gamma - ray spectra than longer bursts .",
    "the two groups seemed indistinguishable in most other bulk properties , although the larger group of long - soft bursts may have a subclass with a different fluence distribution ( i.e. , different @xmath3 ; katz & canel 1996 ) and the groups may have different galactic latitude distributions ( belli 1997 ) .",
    "other researchers point to small groups of bursts with distinctive properties such as the soft - gamma repeaters ( norris et al .",
    "1991 ) , two possible classes with differing short - timescale variability ( lamb , graziani & smith 1993 ) , fast - rise exponential - decay bursts ( bhat et al .",
    "1994 ) , and two types of bursts with different ratios of total fluence and @xmath4300 kev fluence ( pendleton et al . 1997 ) .    a variety of relationships between burst properties have also been reported .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find an anti - correlation between @xmath1 ( calculated after wavelet thresholding ) and peak intensity , consistent with a cosmological time dilation .",
    "however , a positive correlation between @xmath1 and total fluence is also seen which does not agree with the simplest cosmological interpretation ( lee & petrosian 1997 ) .",
    "additional reported relationships include : @xmath1 correlated with peak heights ( lestrade 1994 ) , peak energy correlated with peak flux ( mallozzi et al .",
    "1995 ) , and peak duration anticorrelated with gamma - ray energy ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "most of these studies suffer from a failure to treat all of the bulk property variables in an unbiased and quantitative way .",
    "astronomers typically examine univariate or bivariate distributions , sometimes constructing composite variables ( such as hardness ratios ) with pre - determined relationships to include one or two additional variables .",
    "but it is quite possible that the complex astrophysics producing grbs will not manifest themselves in simple bivariate plots , just as the division between short - hard and long - soft bursts is not evident in spectral variables alone ( pendleton et al .",
    "grb catalogs , like most multiwavelength astronomical catalogs , are multivariate databases and should be treated with multivariate statistical methods that can objectively and effectively uncover structure involving many variables ( feigelson & babu 1997 ) .",
    "two previous studies take a fully multivariate approach to understanding grb bulk properties . baumgart ( 1994 )",
    "constructs a neural network taxonomy of 99 grbs from the pvo satellite using 26 variables representing both bulk burst properties and detailed temporal characteristics ( e.g. number of peaks , fractal dimension , wavelet transform crossings ) and finds two or three distinct grb classes .",
    "bagoly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) perform principal components and factor analyses of nine bulk property variables using 625 grbs from the batse 3b catalog .",
    "they find that the relationships in the database are determined principally by only three variables : an appropriately weighted fluence , a weighted burst duration , and ( to a lesser extent ) flux in the highest energy bin .",
    "we note , however , that it can be dangerous to look for correlations prior to classifying ( or establishing the homogeneity of ) the population . while the anticorrelation between hardness ratio and burst duration seen in full samples ( k93 ) may be the manifestation of a single astrophysical process , it may alternatively reflect differences between distinct processes . the latter possibility is suggested by a reported hardness - duration positive correlation within the long - soft class of bursts ( dezalay et al . 1996 ; horack & hakkila 1997 ) .",
    "most multivariate analyses thus begin with a study of homogeneity and classification , and then investigate the variance - covariance structure ( i.e. correlations ) within each class .",
    "this paper describes a multivariate analysis of grbs from the third batse catalog ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 ) . after defining the sample (  2 )",
    ", we start with a simple statistical description of the variables and their bivariate relationships for the entire dataset (  3 ) .",
    "we then seek distinct types of clusters in two ways .",
    "first , a standard nonparametric agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis is performed (  4 ) which reveals three distinct classes .",
    "the statistical significance of the third cluster is validated , under gaussian assumptions , with manova tests .",
    "second , a parametric maximum likelihood model - based clustering procedure is adopted which reveals the same three groups and indicates strong evidence for the presence for three rather than two groups (  5 ) .",
    "the variance - covariance structure of each group is then examined (  6 ) .",
    "results are synthesized in the discussion (  7 ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", we discuss our mathematical techniques to help the reader understand the complexities of multivariate analysis . from the vast literature in this subject ,",
    "we recommend the following monographs for interested readers : johnson & wichern ( 1992 ) and jobson ( 1992 ) for overviews of applied multivariate analysis ; hartigan ( 1975 ) , jain & dubes ( 1988 ) and kaufman & rousseeuw ( 1990 ) for multivariate clustering algorithms ; murtagh & heck ( 1987 ) and , more briefly , babu & feigelson ( 1996 ) and feigelson & babu ( 1997 ) , for multivariate methodology in astronomy .",
    "our sample is drawn from the third catalog of the _ burst and transient source experiment _ ( batse ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "this 3b catalog has 1122 grbs detected by batse between 1991 april 19 and 1994",
    "september 19 . the catalog is presented and fully described by meegan et al .",
    "our database was extracted from the on - line database www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/data/grb/catalog in may 1996 , which provides many properties of each burst .",
    "there are roughly eleven variables of potential astrophysical interest : two measures of location in galactic coordinates , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; two measures of burst durations , the times within which 50% ( @xmath7 ) and 90% ( @xmath1 ) of the flux arrives ; three peak fluxes @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 measured in 64 ms , 256 ms and 1024 ms bins respectively ; and four time - integrated fluences @xmath11-@xmath12 in the 20 - 50 kev , 50 - 100 kev , 100 - 300 kev and @xmath13 kev spectral channels respectively .",
    "researchers commonly consider three composite variables : the total fluence , @xmath14 , and two measures of spectral hardness derived from the ratios of channel fluences , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . due to the limitations of available multivariate statistical techniques",
    ", we ignore other variables of potential relevance including the heteroscedastic measurement errors of each quantity ( i.e. , errors that differ from point to point ) and truncation values associated with batse triggering operations .    of the 1122 listed bursts ,",
    "807 have data on all the variables described above .",
    "ten bursts listed with zero fluences were eliminated .",
    "our sample thus has 797 batse grbs .",
    "for some analyses , we also used a subset of 644 bursts with ` debiased ' durations , @xmath17 . here",
    "the durations are modified to account for the effect that brighter bursts will have signal above the noise for longer periods than fainter bursts with the same time profiles ( j. norris , private communication ) .",
    "statistical analyses in   3 , 4 and 6 were conducted within the statistical analysis system _ sas / stat _ , a very large and widely distributed commercial statistical software package ( sas institute inc .",
    "_ sas / stat _ procedures _ cluster _ , _ glm _ , _ princomp _ and _ varclus _ were used . the analysis in  5",
    "was performed with the _ mclust _ software ( banfield & raftery 1993 ; fraley 1998 ) , which is interfaced to the splus statistical package ( splus version 3.4 ; mathsoft , inc .",
    "1996 ) and its extensions .",
    "further information is provided at http://stat.washington.edu/fraley/software.html and http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/mclust .",
    "for multivariate data visualization , we used the xgobi ( swayne , cook & buja 1991 ) program , available from the _ statlib _ software archive at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/xgobi .",
    "hypertext links to a variety of public domain software for multivariate analysis , classification and visualization are available at the penn state _",
    "statcodes _ web site , http://www.astro.psu.edu/statcodes .",
    "we are faced with a multivariate database of 797 objects and 15 variables ( 11 variables from the catalog , 3 composite variables , and @xmath18 ) .",
    "two initial problems are frequently faced in analyses of multivariate databases .",
    "first , variables with incompatible units and ranges must be compared .",
    "units can be removed by normalization ( e.g. replacing @xmath11 by @xmath19 ) , by standardization ( e.g. replacing @xmath11 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sample standard deviation ) , or by taking logarithms .",
    "second , the dimensionality of the problem should be reduced , as many of the variables are closely interrelated either by construction or by astronomical circumstance .",
    "although there are no mathematical rules regulating reduction of dimensionality , it can usefully be guided by a correlation matrix showing bivariate relationships and a principal components analysis showing multivariate relationships that are mainly responsible for structured variance in the data .",
    "scientific reasoning can also be used to eliminate consideration of variables .",
    "we conducted a preliminary examination of data representations , correlation matrices and bivariate plots , and principal components analyses to facilitate choice of variables .",
    "when no mathematical preference arose , we selected variables most commonly used by previous researchers to facilitate comparison of results .",
    "our choices were as follows .",
    "we use log variables , rather than normalized or standardized variables .",
    "we kept information on burst fluence and spectra through @xmath22 and hardness ratios rather than through the original fluences @xmath11-@xmath12 .",
    "we initially eliminated @xmath8 and @xmath10 from consideration , and later eliminated @xmath9 when we found that its main contribution to the clustering process was noise .",
    "we chose to remove the location variables @xmath23 , already established by other researchers to be random for the entire sample , but use them later to test for isotropy of subsamples .",
    "the debiased @xmath24 is used only in special tests .",
    "our analysis was thus performed in six or fewer dimensions using log @xmath7 , log @xmath1 , log @xmath22 , log @xmath9 , log @xmath25 and log @xmath26 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 give basic statistics for these six variables : means , standard deviations , and bivariate values of pearson s linear correlation coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 and assuming bivariate normal populations , any @xmath29 implies that a correlation between the two variables exists at a two - tailed significance level @xmath30 ( beyer 1968 , pp .",
    "389 and 283 ) . but",
    "from an astrophysical perspective , we might consider any relationship with @xmath31 to be of little interest .",
    "figure 1 shows the bivariate scatter plots .",
    "the correlation structure of the entire sample ( table 2 ) shows that the two measures of duration and the two measures of spectral hardness have correlation near unity , indicating that they are nearly redundant . @xmath22 and @xmath9 are quite dissimilar : @xmath22 shows a strong correlation with burst duration ( e.g. lee & petrosian 1997 ) and no relation to hardness , while @xmath9 shows no relation to duration but is mildly correlated with hardness ( mallozzi et al .",
    "burst duration is anticorrelated with hardness ( k93 ; fenimore et al .",
    "the cosmological anticorrelation between duration and peak flux reported by norris et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is statistically significant , but accounts for only a few percent of the variance between these variables . the correlation matrix based on the debiased @xmath18 values yields very similar results .",
    "however , the scatter plots ( figure 1 ) show a more complex story .",
    "first , many plots show inhomogeneous distributions inconsistent with the unimodal multinormal ( i.e. multivariate gaussian ) population assumed by pearson s @xmath27 .",
    "the distributions often seem bimodal with asymmetrical non - gaussian shapes .",
    "one outlier burst is also seen in several projections .",
    "we therefore consider the hypothesis that the sample consists of two or more distinct classes , and proceed to find the ` clusters ' using well - established methods .",
    "agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a procedure based on the successive merging of proximate pairs of clusters of objects .",
    "it produces a clustering tree or dendrogram starting with n clusters of 1 member ( or a coarse partition based on prior knowledge ) and ending with one cluster of n members .",
    "unfortunately , there are many possible ways to proceed ; mathematics provides little guidance among the choices and no probabilistic evaluation of the results without the imposition of additional assumptions .",
    "the scientist must make four decisions to fully define the clustering procedure :    1 .   creating _ unit - free variables _ is essential for meaningful treatment of objects in multivariate space (  3 ) .",
    "a favorite choice by statisticians is standardization , where each variable is normalized by the standard deviation of the sample .",
    "astronomers more commonly make logarithmic transformations or construct ratios of variables sharing the same units .",
    "we follow the tradition of grb researchers by measuring spectral hardness with ratios of fluences having the same units , and making logarithmic transformations of all variables .",
    "the _ metric _ defines the meaning of proximity between two objects or clusters .",
    "common choices are the simple euclidean distance between unit - free variables and the squares of euclidean distances .",
    "we chose the former option for most of the analyses in this section .",
    "3 .   several _ merging procedures _ can be used .",
    "one might begin by merging the clusters with the nearest neighbors .",
    "this is called single linkage clustering and is most familiar in astronomy where it is frequently called the friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "it tends to produce long stringy clusters , and is equivalent to a well - known divisive clustering procedure known as pruning the minimal spanning tree .",
    "complete linkage proceeds by maximizing the distance between clusters , and leads to evenly bifurcating dendrograms . for most of our analysis ,",
    "we choose average linkage where the distance between two clusters is the average of the distances between pairs of observations , where each member of the pair comes from a different cluster .",
    "this is a compromise between single and complete linkage and tends to give compact clusters . specifically , the distance between clusters k and l is given by ( e.g. sas institute inc .",
    "1989 , pp .",
    "529ff ; johnson & wichern 1992 , pp .",
    "@xmath32 where the bar indicates an unweighted mean , @xmath33-th cluster .",
    "another popular choice is ward s minimum variance criterion where the distance between the two clusters is the anova ( analysis of variance ) sum of squares between two clusters added up over all variables ( ward 1963 ) , @xmath34 if the sample is generated by a mixture of multinormal ( i.e. multidimensional gaussian ) distributions where each distribution has covariance matrix of the form @xmath35 , this method joins clusters to maximize the likelihood at each level of the hierarchy , and so is a special case of the model - based clustering methodology to be discussed in  5 . 4 .",
    "as the procedure gives a hierarchy from @xmath36 clusters with 1 object down to one cluster with @xmath36 objects , the user must choose _ how many clusters to report _ as scientifically important clusters .",
    "this choice can be assisted by examination of two statistics .",
    "the squared correlation coefficient , @xmath37 , states the fraction of the total variance accounted for by a partition into @xmath38 clusters , @xmath39 the squared semi - partial correlation coefficient , @xmath40 measures the difference in the variance between the resulting cluster and the immediate parent clusters normalized by the total sample variance , @xmath41 @xmath37 thus tells how much of the scatter is explained by a given level of clustering , and @xmath40 tells how much improvement is achieved between levels .",
    "we emphasize again that there is no mathematically ` best ' choice , although extensive experience with problems in many fields has led to a preference for certain combinations ( e.g. standardized variables and ward s minimum variance criterion ) .",
    "we conducted extensive experiments with different choices .",
    "the last several levels of the clustering tree for the 797 grbs using the six unit - free variables shown in table 1 , average linkage and a euclidean metric are shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) with details in table 3a . the action taken at each level",
    "is indicated in column 2 of table 3 , which may refer to a level higher in the tree which ( for brevity ) is not shown here .",
    "two types of mergers are seen : the incorporation of ` twigs ' of one or a few grbs into a large preexisting ` trunk ' ( levels 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 7 ) ; and the union of two substantial branches into a single larger trunk ( levels 2 , 6 and 8) .",
    "the first type has little effect on the variance of the sample with @xmath42% .",
    "the single grb brought into the main trunk at level 1 is the distant outlier seen in several panels of figure 1 .",
    "the level 2 merger of clusters with 190 and 606 members is clearly the most important structure , accounting for roughly 53% of the variance of the entire sample .",
    "this is the bifurcation of the sample into two classes easily seen in figure 1 and noted by k93 and others .",
    "the principal finding that is not immediately obvious from figure 1 is the structure indicated at level 6 .",
    "the main trunk of 599 bursts ( plus a few twigs to be merged later ) is divided into groups of 93 and 506 bursts .",
    "this division accounts for 10% of the total variance of the sample , indicated in both the @xmath37 and @xmath40 values .",
    "we found that the twigs in the tree structure disappear if the peak flux @xmath9 variable is omitted and the analysis is made in 5-dimensional space ( figure 2 , right panel , and table 3b ) . here",
    "the largest cluster of 593 members is formed by the union of clusters with 107 and 486 bursts , again accounting for 10% of the sample variance .",
    "it is possible that @xmath9 is a nuisance variable irrelevant to the basic astrophysics of grbs , producing noisy ` twigs ' seen in table 3a and figure 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "we tested many variants of hierarchical clustering .",
    "we replaced average linkage hypothesis with complete linkage , single linkage and ward s minimum variance criterion .",
    "the ward s criterion computation , for example , gave three clusters with 468 , 145 and 184 bursts .",
    "we clustered using nonparametric density estimation based on the 100 nearest neighbors , and clustered using the principal components rather than the observed variables .",
    "various methods were tried with both the observed @xmath1 values and debiased @xmath18 values , with little effect on the results .",
    "all methods showed two strong clusters and the outlier but , in some cases , the third cluster appeared only weakly .    to proceed further , we choose a single clustering structure for detailed study : the 5-dimensional average linkage analysis ( table 3b ) with three clusters  class i with 486 bursts , class ii with 203 bursts , class iii with 107 bursts .",
    "class iv consisting of the single outlier is ignored because of independent evidence that its properties are due to data of poor quality (  7 ) . the membership of these clusters is given in table 4 , and four projections of the clusters onto two - dimensional scatter plots are shown in figure 3 .",
    "these are frames from the ` grand tour ' movie of the 5-dimensional dataset provided by the xgobi software where each cluster is ` brushed ' with a different symbol .",
    "note that , in general , there is no reason why classification structure should be most evident in projections parallel to the variable axes shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is more important that the clusters show cohesion in many projections of the dataset .",
    "the grand tour of the 797 grbs shows that classes i , ii and the outlier are very distinct in most projections .",
    "class iii often lies between classes i and ii ( e.g. top panels of figure 3 ) , but in other projections is offset from the line between classes i and ii ( e.g. bottom panels of figure 3 ) .",
    "it also appears elongated along some projections , while the larger classes i and ii appear roughly hyperspherical .",
    "this analyses described here provide considerable evidence for three major clusters and an outlier . but as some nonparametric clustering procedures did not find a strong third cluster , there is some some worry that class iii is simply a group of bursts with properties intermediate between the classes i and ii . while nonparametric hierarchical clustering methods can not address this question , it can be investigated with parametric methods .",
    "mathematically well - founded methods for evaluating the statistical significance of a proposed multivariate classification scheme are available under the assumption that the population is a multinormal mixture ; that is , the objects of each class are drawn from multivariate gaussians .",
    "all relationships between the variables must thus be linear ( as in table 2 ) , although the relationships may differ between clusters .",
    "there is no requirement of sphericity , so that clusters may have shapes akin to pancakes or cigars with arbitrary orientations in multidimensional space .",
    "the separate existence of each of the postulated subpopulations can be tested using multivariate analysis of variance ( manova ) .",
    "the results of our manova calculations are summarized in table 5 .",
    "the columns give the values of the three manova statistics , followed by details for the wilks @xmath0 : the corresponding value of the @xmath58 statistic , the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom for that @xmath58 value ; and the resulting @xmath60 value .",
    "details for pillai s and hotelling - lawley s traces are omitted , but give similar results in all cases .",
    "the first row tests the null hypothesis that the classes i , ii and iii have the same mean , the second row tests the equality of classes i and ii , and so forth . the @xmath58 values are very high in all cases , indicating that the clusters are different with extremely high statistical significance ( @xmath61 ) . as the tails of the distribution",
    "are poorly determined unless the sample size is extremely large .",
    "] this is a clear _ quantitative _ demonstration that at least two clusters exist among grbs ( for a univariate test , see ashman , bird & zepf 1994 ) , which was _ qualitatively _ reported by delazay et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and k93 .",
    "the other rows in table 5 test the hypotheses that each proposed class has the same mean as each other class .",
    "one problem with these manova tests is that they are conditional on the classification that has been found using the clustering algorithm . because the clustering algorithm is constructed to find groups that are different from one another , tests such as these tend to be biased towards finding structure , perhaps where none exists .",
    "although the manova results seem to indicate very strong evidence of structure , they can not be taken as definitive for this reason .",
    "tests arising from model - based clustering can overcome this problem , as discussed in the following section .",
    "in the previous section , we conducted a hierarchical clustering analysis without making assumptions regarding the shapes of the clusters , but needed the parametric assumption of normality to estimate the statistical significance of the resulting classification .",
    "it is reasonable to conduct the entire analysis , both clustering and validation , within a model - based framework .",
    "we report here an analysis of this type again assuming that the grb population consists of a mixture of multivariate gaussian classes .",
    "early development of this model for clustering is discussed in mclachlan & basford ( 1988 ) ; we use more recent developments here .",
    "first , an initial classification for each possible number of clusters is found via agglomerative hierarchical clustering ( murtagh & raftery 1984 , banfield & raftery 1993 , fraley 1998 ) .",
    "next , the em ( expectation - maximization ) algorithm is used to refine partitions obtained from hierarchical clustering ( celeux & govaert 1995 , dasgupta & raftery 1998 ) . finally , the bayesian information criterion is used to select the ` best ' partition among those associated with different numbers of clusters ( dasgupta & raftery 1998 ) .    in the model considered here ,",
    "the @xmath43-dimensional observations @xmath62 are drawn from @xmath38 multinormal groups , each of which is characterized by a vector of parameters @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "our goals are : to determine the number of grb types , @xmath38 ; to determine the cluster assignment of each burst ; and to estimate the mean @xmath65 and covariance matrix @xmath66 for each cluster .",
    "following fraley ( 1998 ) , the density of an observation @xmath67 from the @xmath68th subpopulation is expressed as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 means multivariate normal .",
    "we estimate the parameters using the principle of maximum likelihood . in the hierarchical clustering phase ,",
    "we use the classification likelihood @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents the observations and @xmath73 is the cluster assignment : @xmath74 when @xmath75 comes from the @xmath68-th group .",
    "equivalently , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the set of indices corresponding to observations belonging to the @xmath68-th group .",
    "the method used here for maximizing the likelihood ( fraley 1998 ) and implemented in the _ mclust _ code involves parameterization of the @xmath78 matrices in terms of their eigenvectors and eigenvalues ( analogous to a principal components analysis ) , and iterative relocation of the clusters using the em algorithm .",
    "the em ( estimation - maximization ) algorithm ( dempster , laird & rubin 1977 ) , one of the most successful methods in modern statistics , is a procedure for iteratively maximizing likelihoods in a wide variety of circumstances .",
    "for example , the lucy - richardson algorithm in astronomical image restoration is the em algorithm . in the present application",
    ", we apply em to the mixture likelihood @xmath79 where @xmath80 are mixing probabilities associated with each group . for a given number @xmath38 of components in the mixture , we use em to estimate the conditional probability that observation @xmath62 belongs to the @xmath68-th group for each @xmath45 and selected @xmath68 via maximum likelihood .",
    "although the computational procedure has some limitations ( e.g. convergence of the em iterations is not guaranteed ; clusters can not be extremely small ) , it is generally efficient and effective for gaussian clustering problems when started from reasonable partitions such as those produced by hierarchical agglomeration .",
    "we use the bayes factor to assess the evidence for a given number of clusters against a different number of clusters .",
    "the bayes factor , defined in the context of bayesian statistics , is the posterior odds for one model against the other when the prior odds are equal to one ( i.e. , when one does not favor one model over the other _ a priori _ ) .",
    "kass & raftery ( 1995 ) review the use of bayes factors in adjudicating between competing scientific hypotheses on the basis of data .",
    "the bayes factor for a model @xmath81 against a competing model @xmath82 ( say , for three @xmath83 two classes of grbs ) is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 ) for @xmath86 is obtained by integrating the likelihood times the prior density over the parameters of the model .",
    "it can be viewed as a likelihood ratio , but it differs from the usual frequentist ratio that underlies the likelihood ratio test in that the latter is obtained by maximizing ( rather than integrating ) the likelihood over the model parameters .    twice the logarithm of the bayes factor can be approximated by the bayesian information criterion or bic ( schwarz 1978 ) , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the likelihood and @xmath89 is the number of parameters for one mixture model , and similarly for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the bic measures the balance between the improvement in the likelihood and the number of model parameters needed to achieve that likelihood .",
    "while the absolute value of the bic is not informative , differences between the bic values for two competing models provide estimates of the evidence in the data for one model against another .",
    "conventionally , bic differences @xmath92 represent weak evidence , differences between 2 and 6 represent positive evidence , @xmath93 strong evidence , and @xmath94 very strong evidence ( jeffreys 1961 , appendix b ; kass & raftery 1995 ) .",
    "the use of the bic in choosing clusters in a mixture or clustering model is discussed by roeder & wasserman ( 1997 ) and dasgupta & raftery ( 1998 ) .",
    "bayes factors and bic have the advantage that they can be used to assess the evidence _ for _ a null hypothesis , unlike standard significance tests which can only reject a null hypothesis .",
    "they can also easily be used to compare non - nested models , again unlike standard significance tests which require competing models to be nested .      to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and the complexity of the calculation ,",
    "we eliminated the highly redundant @xmath7 and @xmath26 variables ( see figure 1 ) and considered only the 3 variables @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath25 for the sample of 797 batse grbs .",
    "the _ mclust _ model - based clustering procedure described above was run for trials of @xmath95 groups .",
    "the resulting values of bic(@xmath38 ) are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "the maximum bic is achieved for three classes .",
    "most importantly , the bic value for @xmath96 is @xmath97 units above that for @xmath98 .",
    "this corresponds to strong evidence indeed for the presence of three groups rather than two .",
    "this result strongly confirms the analysis in  4 indicating the existence of three clusters , and this time is free of the problem that the manova tests are conditional on the estimated partition .",
    "the result here takes account of the fact that the partition is not known in advance .",
    "we have also calculated the bic for @xmath99 with various constraints on the covariance matrix * @xmath100 * such as hypersphericity and uniformly shaped ellipsoids .",
    "spherical clusters give poor fits .",
    "uniform ellipsoids give good fits with 4 and 8 clusters .",
    "but in all cases , the maximum likelihood assuming 2 clusters is much lower than the likelihood of @xmath101 clusters .",
    "the cluster assignment vector @xmath102 for the @xmath96 model with unconstrained * @xmath100 * is given in table 4 .",
    "over 85% of the assignments are the same as those obtained from the nonparametric hierarchical clustering procedure in  4 , so that we note only differences between the two clustering results with @xmath103 and @xmath104 markings .",
    "all but one of the 96 assignment differences move bursts from classes i and ii into class iii .",
    "the close agreement between the cluster assignments in the two methods reinforces confidences in the conclusions from both of them .",
    "we can now examine the properties of grbs within each cluster with reasonable confidence that the populations are distinct from each other but internally homogeneous .",
    "these properties become inputs to astrophysical theories seeking to explain grb bulk properties .",
    "table 6a lists the means and standard deviations of the principal variables for each cluster based on both the nonparametric and model - based clustering procedures .",
    "the two methods give very similar results .",
    "the three types are well - separated in the burst duration variables : cluster i bursts have the longest durations around @xmath105-@xmath106 seconds , cluster ii bursts have the shortest durations below 1 second , and cluster iii bursts have intermediate durations around 2 seconds .",
    "this is shown clearly in figure 5 , which projects each class onto the univariate @xmath1 axis .",
    "cluster iii bursts are also intermediate in their fluences , although their fluence distribution overlaps that of the fainter class ii bursts . the hardness ratios of all three clusters overlap considerably , but class iii bursts have the softest spectra and class i bursts have intermediate spectra .",
    "we can thus classify the types in the three principal dimensions duration / fluence / spectrum ( table 6c ) : class i is long / bright / intermediate , class ii is short / faint / hard , and class iii is intermediate / intermediate / soft .",
    "a major constraint for the astrophysical interpretation of grbs has been the remarkable isotropy of their spatial distribution in the celestial sphere .",
    "it is possible that , while the bulk of grbs are isotropic and have an inferred extragalactic origin , some class of grbs have significant anisotropy which would reflect a galactic origin ( see lamb 1995 ) . we apply four statistical tests for isotropy discussed by briggs ( 1993 ) and applied by briggs et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to various subsamples of the 3rd batse catalog of grbs .",
    "the statistics are : @xmath107cos@xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the angle between a burst and the galactic center ; @xmath107sin@xmath110 , where @xmath6 is the galactic latitude ; rayleigh - watson @xmath111 ; and bingham @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath107cos@xmath108 tests the dipole moment around the galactic center , @xmath107sin@xmath110 tests the quadrapole moment with respect to the galactic plane , @xmath111 tests the dipole moment around any point in the celestial sphere , and @xmath112 tests the quadrapole moment around any plane or two poles .",
    "the expected values for the four statistics assuming random isotropic distribution on the sphere are 0 , 0 , 3 and 5 respectively .",
    "the asymptotic distributions of these statistics are known .",
    "table 6b shows the results of this analysis for clusters i - iii , kindly calculated for us by michael briggs .",
    "no deviations from isotropy are found .",
    "the @xmath107cos@xmath108 and @xmath107sin@xmath113 values lie within one standard deviation of the expected value for a random distribution .",
    "the @xmath111 and @xmath112 values must be larger than the expected value to indicate anisotropy .",
    "the only such case , class ii with @xmath1147.32 , has a deviation with very low significance ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "we thus do not confirm belli s ( 1997 ) report of significant differences in spatial distributions of burst classes i and iii , although we did not specifically test the galactic latitude distribution .    in principle",
    ", the relative populations of the three classes may be an important constraint on astrophysical theory .",
    "we find that class i contains more than half of the bursts with the remainder divided between class ii and class iii ( table 6c ) .",
    "but we do not believe our analysis gives a precise census for two reasons .",
    "first , the exact assignments of individual bursts to clusters depend on the detailed assumptions of the clustering algorithms . for example",
    ", class ii is larger than class iii in the 5-dimensional nonparametric procedure but is smaller in the 3-dimensional model - based procedure .",
    "second , the numbers of weaker bursts in classes ii and iii are strongly dependent on the details of the batse instrument s burst triggering process which produces a complicated truncation bias for fainter bursts .    we look for structure within each of the clusters by computing correlation coefficients similar to those in  3 for the entire sample .",
    "results are given in table 7 .",
    "here we see a systematic difference between the two clustering methodologies : nonparametric average linkage clustering tends to give stronger correlations between the variables than the model - based clustering .",
    "for example , in the nonparametric analysis we find significant positive correlations between total fluence and hardness in classes i and ii , and a correlation between duration and fluence in class ii .",
    "however , we attach more credence to the model - based results for this purpose than the average linkage results because the former method is specifically designed to provide optimal estimates of the within - group covariances given the clustering model",
    ". the model - based results do not give strong evidence for any non - zero correlations between variables , suggesting that the partition into three clusters explains all of the correlation between variables in the full dataset .",
    "we thus find , using clustering and validation methods with different mathematical underpinnings , that three classes of grbs are present in our large subset of the third batse catalog .",
    "most of the structure can be found using three fundamental burst properties , duration / fluence / spectrum .",
    "the class properties and relation to previous research can be briefly summarized as follows :    class i : :    these long / bright / intermediate bursts correspond to the well - known    populous long - soft class of k93 and others . within this group ,",
    "we do    not confirm a hardness - duration correlation reported by dezalay et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and horack & hakkila ( 1997 ) .",
    "class ii : :    this short / faint / hard group corresponds to the short - hard burst type    of k93 and others .",
    "fluence - duration and fluence - hardness correlations    may tentatively be present within the class .",
    "note that while the mean    location of this type is consistent in the two clustering schemes , its    size and population ( e.g. 1/2 or 1/4 that of class i ) differs between    clustering algorithms .",
    "class iii : :    the discovery of this group with intermediate / intermediate / soft    properties is the principal result of this study . the group is easily    distinguished in the projections of figure 3 , but can also be    discerned in some panels of figure 1 .",
    "for example , it lies between    classes i and ii in the @xmath116 ,    @xmath117 and @xmath118 scatter    plots . in the univariate @xmath1 distribution shown in    figure 5 ,",
    "class iii accounts for most , but not all , of the bursts in    the small peak around @xmath119 sec between the major    short and long duration peaks .",
    "it is possible that our class iii is    related to the class of no - high - energy ( nhe ) burst and peaks discussed    by pendleton et al .",
    "these bursts have unusually weak    @xmath12 emission , soft @xmath120 kev spectra , and    low @xmath22 .",
    "however , the nhe class does not appear to    exhibit a clear duration segregation from other bursts as we find for    class iii .",
    "class iii does not appear to be the third cluster found by    baumgart ( 1994 , see his table 3 ) , but the high dimensionality of his    analysis prevents a simple comparison with our low dimensionality    study .",
    "outlier : :    batse trigger event 2757 , burst 3b 940114 , is the outlier in the    nonparametric analysis of  4 and is clearly visible in many    projections in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "it has an exceedingly soft hardness ratio and short    burst duration . but",
    "examination of the original batse database shows    that the @xmath121 fluxes are very weak with large    measurement uncertainties .",
    "the published 3b catalog gives only an    upper limit to its total fluence and no estimate of its hardness ratio    ( meegan et al .",
    "the unusual properties of this burst are thus    illusory and are due to its very weak fluence .",
    "the multivariate analysis described here is not comprehensive and may not have uncovered all of the structure in the third batse catalog of bulk grb properties .",
    "our reduction of dimensionality may have been too severe , omitting , for example , the potentially important @xmath12 as a distinct variable ( pendleton et al .",
    "1997 ; bagoly et al .",
    "1997 ) . many methodological options were not exercised .",
    "for example , it would be valuable to repeatedly apply the @xmath68-means partitioning algorithm to the database under the assumption that three clusters are present ( see murtagh 1992 for an astronomical application of this method ) , check for skewness or kurtosis in the clusters , and undertake an oblique decision tree analysis to give analytical formulation to hyperplanes separating the clusters ( see white 1997 ) .",
    "codes for these and many other multivariate techniques are publicly available through the web metasite _ statcodes _ at www.astro.psu.edu/statcodes .    however , the efforts described here are far more capable of finding and quantifying clustering in the database than most previous analyses (  1 ) .",
    "previous studies have been based on qualitative rather than quantitative procedures for identifying structures , and provide no statistical validation of their claims .",
    "it is thus not surprising that we uncovered structure missed by previous researchers . in particular ,",
    "our confidence in the presence of a third cluster , class iii , is strong .",
    "two completely independent mathematical procedures (  4 and  5 ) found very similar structure , each validated with high statistical confidence .",
    "it is possible that the clustering reported here is indeed present in the database , but does not have an astrophysical origin .",
    "the complex triggering mechanism of the batse instrument mechanism and biases in bulk property values at low signal - to - noise ratio are two problems that probably affect the multivariate structure .",
    "we have investigated one manifestation of the latter effect using @xmath18 and found no effect on our results .",
    "instrumental biases generally affect the number of bursts found in some regions of the multivariate hyperspace ( thereby biasing log @xmath36 - log @xmath122 distributions ) and may alter the location of clusters , but are unlikely to cause the appearance of clustering that is not present in the underlying population . nonetheless , since the batse instrument identifies bursts on three separate timescales , it is possible that the third cluster here is related to a selection effect associated with the batse triggering mechanisms .",
    "we conclude that the third batse catalog shows three statistically significant types of bursts ( duration / fluence / spectrum ) : class i grbs are long / bright / intermediate , class ii grbs are short / faint / hard , and class iii grbs are intermediate / intermediate / soft . unless the separation of class iii from the other types is due to some subtle batse instrumental effect , these types are likely to be real and their existence should be considered an important input into astrophysical theories for grbs .",
    "for example , the three types may reflect different types of external environments and internal shocks in relativistic fireball models ( mszros & rees 1993 ; panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) .",
    "note that statistical anlaysis is unable to determine whether burst types represent fundamentally different astrophysical processes or distinct conditions within a single astrophysical model .",
    "our results can be confirmed and extended in two fashions .",
    "first , the analysis described here can be validated with several hundred more bursts collected by batse since the september 1994 cutoff in the database used here .",
    "second , following baumgart ( 1994 ) , the dimensionality of the problem can be enlarged to include detailed characteristics of the burst temporal behaviors . burst smoothness @xmath83 peakiness , characteristic wavelet scales , spectral evolution , and other parameters can be included . with this enlarged database",
    ", one can perform both an unsupervised exploratory cluster analysis similar to that described here , and manova - type analyses that assume the existence of the three groups to determine whether the clusters have distinctive temporal properties .",
