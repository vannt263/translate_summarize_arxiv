    "this work is part of a series of papers devoted to the study of gas adsorption and capillary condensation in silica aerogels@xcite .",
    "our goal is to provide a theoretical interpretation of @xmath0he adsorption experiments that have been performed over the last 15 years in several low - temperature physics groups@xcite .",
    "more generally , we wish to propose a theoretical framework for describing the _ nonequilibrium _ ( hysteretic ) behavior of fluids in disordered porous solids@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the experimental studies of helium in aerogel were originally aimed at understanding the effect of quenched random impurities on _ equilibrium _ critical phenomena and phase separation . in particular ,",
    "the study of the liquid - vapor transition of @xmath0he followed from the suggestion that the critical behavior of mixtures or pure fluids confined in porous media or in contact with a gel network could be interpreted in terms of the random field ising model ( rfim)@xcite . in this perspective , the use of aerogel was motivated by its very tenuous structure ( which minimizes the effects of confinement ) and by the fact that the porosity ( and thus the amount of disorder ) can be varied in a controlled way .",
    "however , in spite of the early claim that mesoscopic equilibrium phase separation of @xmath0he could be observed in a @xmath1 porosity aerogel@xcite , leading to an estimation of the order parameter critical exponent @xmath2 , it now seems more and more questionable that true equilibrium behavior is observed in experiments .",
    "in particular , recent measurements of sorption isotherms using a high - precision capacitive technique@xcite show that hysteresis between filling and emptying persists to temperatures very close to the critical temperature of pure helium ( @xmath3 , and gradual adsorption is always observed above @xmath4 , instead of the sharp vertical step expected for two - phase coexistence .",
    "similar observations have been made by another group@xcite , using a low - frequency mechanical pendulum technique and , more recently , coupling pressure and optical measurements .",
    "these results are reminiscent of the behavior of fluids confined in dense porous glasses which is usually interpreted in terms of capillary condensation .",
    "although this moves away the exciting perspective of studying the putative equilibrium vapor - liquid critical point of @xmath0he inside aerogel , the remarkable changes in the hysteretic behavior of the adsorbed fluid with temperature and porosity remain to be explained . in particular",
    ", the hysteresis loops in very light aerogels have a rectangular ( instead of triangular ) shape at very low temperature ( for instance , at @xmath5 in @xmath6 porosity aerogel@xcite ) with a very steep adsorption branch that suggests the presence of a genuine , but _ nonequilibrium _ , first - order phase transition .",
    "this is in agreement with our theoretical description@xcite which predicts the change from a continuous to a discontinuous adsorption isotherm as one decreases the temperature ( at constant porosity ) or increases the porosity ( at constant temperature ) , the jump in the fluid density corresponding to a macroscopic avalanche in the system .",
    "( note that we only focus here on adsorption .",
    "the behavior on desorption is also interesting but is related to other physical processes as discussed in refs.@xcite . )",
    "this scenario , which resembles the one predicted for the field - driven rfim at zero temperature@xcite and observed in some disordered magnetic systems@xcite , suggests the existence of a line of disorder - induced critical points in the temperature - porosity diagram with an associated scaling behavior . in the present work",
    "we further elaborate on this issue by presenting new results concerning the avalanche properties as a function of temperature and porosity and by studying the scaling behavior of the adsorption isotherms in the vicinity of the nonequilibrium critical points .",
    "we are also interested in characterizing the avalanches geometrically and studying their possible relation with the aerogel structure .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the model and the theory . in section 3",
    "we present the results for the statistical properties of avalanches . in section 4",
    "we discuss the scaling behavior of the adsorption isotherms and present the phase diagram of the model in the temperature - porosity plane .",
    "we conclude , in section 5 , with a discussion of the relevance of our results to experiments .",
    "since both the model and the theory were described in detail in ealier work ( see in particular ref.@xcite ) , we will restrict the presentation to some key aspects that are relevant to our present goal .",
    "the gel - fluid system is modelled by a _ coarse - grained _ lattice - gas where each cell of the size of a silica particle ( typically a few nanometers@xcite ) is occupied either by the solid or the fluid . the distribution of silica particles on the lattice is obtained by a diffusion - limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca ) algorithm@xcite , so as to model the intricate microstructure of actual base - catalized silica aerogels . on the other hand",
    ", fluid particles can equilibrate with a reservoir that fixes their chemical potential @xmath7 and the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "multiple occupancy of a site is forbidden and only nearest - neighbors ( nn ) attractive interactions are considered . for reasons that are explained in ref.@xcite ,",
    "we use a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice and periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the linear size ) .    for a given configuration of the solid matrix ,",
    "fluid configurations are obtained by minimizing a grand - potential functional in the local mean field approximation@xcite , @xmath11&=k_bt \\sum_{i } [ \\rho_i\\ln \\rho_i + ( \\eta_i-\\rho_i)\\ln ( \\eta_i-\\rho_i ) ]   -w_{ff }   \\sum_{<ij > } \\rho_i\\rho_j    -w_{sf }   \\sum_{<ij > } [ \\rho_i(1-\\eta_j ) + \\rho_j(1-\\eta_i)]-\\mu \\sum_{i } \\rho_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the thermally averaged fluid density at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the quenched occupancy variable for the gel particles ( @xmath16 if the site is occupied by the gel and @xmath17 otherwise ) . @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the fluid - fluid and solid - fluid interactions , respectively , and the double summations run over all distinct pairs of nn sites .",
    "the gel porosity is given by @xmath20 and the ratio @xmath21 controls the wettability of the solid surface .",
    "@xmath22 $ ] thus defines a grand - potential landscape whose extrema are obtained by solving the corresponding euler - lagrange equations @xmath23 . at fixed @xmath8 and @xmath24 , and for a given realization of the solid ,",
    "this yields a set of @xmath25 coupled nonlinear equations    @xmath26 ) } } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 and the sum runs over the nearest neighbors of site @xmath14 .",
    "a crucial feature of these equations is that they may have a large number of solutions at low temperature ( and in a certain range of @xmath24 ) as a consequence of the randomness of the solid matrix@xcite .",
    "we believe that this feature is the key for understanding the physics of adsorption in disordered porous solids . especially important",
    "are the local _ minima _ of @xmath22 $ ] which are obtained by solving the set of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) iteratively@xcite and which correspond to metastable states ( to be distinguished from the global minimum of @xmath22 $ ] that defines the true equilibrium state ) .",
    "note that despite its mean - field character ( by which thermal fluctuations are only crudely described ) , the present approach fully accounts for the disorder - induced fluctuations .",
    "in contrast with the standard global mean - field approximation , our treatment still allows to describe strongly inhomogenous configurations and to predict non - classical critical behavior .",
    "computing the metastable states is however not sufficient for describing the nonequilibrium behavior of the system , and one also needs to specify a dynamics .",
    "our theoretical description@xcite is based on the use of a non - ergodic , deterministic , _ zero - temperature_-like dynamics which neglects all thermally activated processes that would allow the system to cross the ( grand - potential ) barriers : a change in the fluid configurations is thus only due to a change in the landscape that comes itself from a change in the temperature or from a variation of the external field ( here the chemical potential @xmath24 ) . as @xmath24 varies ( for instance , when the pressure in the reservoir is slowly increased at constant @xmath8 ) , the system either follows the minimum in which it was trapped as this minimum deforms gradually , or it falls instantaneoulsy into another minimum when the former reaches its stability limit .",
    "this latter move is a discontinuous and irreversible process , an _ avalanche _ , which is at the origin of the history - dependent behavior of the system .",
    "the avalanche corresponds to some _ collective _ condensation event inside the gel network which manifests itself by a jump in the adsorption isotherm ( whereas the gradual deformation of a minimum only corresponds to a slight swelling of the liquid domains ) .",
    "the size of the avalanche is thus given by the size of the jump , i.e. the discontinuous change in the average fluid density @xmath28 . as was shown qualitatively in ref.@xcite",
    ", these condensation events occur at different length scales inside the gel , depending on chemical potential , temperature , and porosity .",
    "in particular , when @xmath29 is large enough , for instance @xmath30 , there exists a critical point separating a high - temperature regime where all condensation events are of microscopic or mesoscopic size ( and the adsorption isotherm is smooth in the thermodynamic limit ) , and a low - temperature regime where a macroscopic fraction of the gas condenses , which yields a finite jump in the isotherm .",
    "it is one goal of the present work to put these observations on a more quantitative basis .",
    "we shall discuss below in more detail the relevance of this theoretical description to the actual experimental situation .",
    "let us just recall that this picture is expected to be valid when there are widely separated time scales in the problem .",
    "specifically , the observation time must be much larger than the local equilibration time ( i.e. the time needed to relax from a marginally stable state to a nearby metastable state ) but much smaller than the time associated to thermal activation ( i.e. the time that it takes to escape from a local minimum via a nearby saddle point)@xcite .",
    "this requires that energy barriers are much larger than temperature , which is indeed the case in many experimental situations dealing with random systems .",
    "it may also be noted that our definition of avalanches generalizes the one used at @xmath31 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we indeed introduce an explicit temperature - dependence in the problem by allowing the ( mean - field ) free - energy landscape itself to change with @xmath8 ( for a similar approach in the context of random magnets , see e.g. ref .",
    "as shown in our previous works , this dependence explains quite convincingly the variations observed in the hysteretic behavior of gases adsorbed in disordered solids at low enough temperature .",
    "as discussed in the preceding papers of this series@xcite , the number , size and shape of the condensation events along an adsorption isotherm depend on porosity and temperature .",
    "they also depend on the value of the chemical potential at which they occur .",
    "the random character of these events ( each finite - size sample has a different isotherm ) requires a statistical study of their properties , an issue that has been investigated in great detail in the context of the field - driven rfim@xcite .",
    "the first problem is to identify each avalanche properly . at @xmath31 , when the microscopic variables can only take discrete values ( such as the ising spins in the rfim ) , this is an easy task because the energy landscape only changes through the disappearance of minima , which induces the avalanches .",
    "one can then vary the external field until a spin becomes unstable ( this spin is unique when the random field distribution is continuous ) and then count the number of spins that flip during the avalanche to determine its size . at finite temperature , on the other hand , one has to deal with continuous variables ( the local fluid densities @xmath12 in the present case ) , and since @xmath32 , the increment in the chemical potential along the adsorption isotherm , is always finite , one has to distinguish between the gradual deformation of a minimum and the jump associated to the passage to another local minimum , both leading to a change in the total density . moreover , if @xmath32 is not small enough , several avalanches may overlap , which biases the statistics of their number or size distribution .",
    "although , in principle , one could precisely locate the beginning of each avalanche by following the evolution of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath33 with @xmath24 or @xmath8 ( an avalanche starts when a local spinodal corresponding to the vanishing of a certain eigenvalue is reached@xcite ) , this is a daunting numerical task for a large system ( with @xmath34 ) and it is more advisable to use another procedure .",
    "let us first note that the determination of the location and size of the avalanches depends on the precision in the computation of the metastable states . since these latter are obtained by solving the set of eqs . ( 2 ) iteratively , it must be checked that the results are not significantly modified when the convergence criterium of the iterative procedure is changed .",
    "all the results presented here were computed with a precision @xmath35 ( i.e. , the calculation was stopped at iteration @xmath36 when @xmath37 ) .",
    "it was found that decreasing @xmath38 to @xmath39 did not change the results by more than @xmath40 ( but in turn the computational time was increased by a considerable factor ) .",
    "porosity aerogel at @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the average fluid density inside the aerogel and @xmath24 the gas chemical potential ) .",
    "calculations were done in a sample of size @xmath43 using the dichotomy procedure explained in the text.,width=302 ]    consider now the variations @xmath44 in the local fluid densities when increasing the chemical potential by a very small ( but finite ) increment @xmath32 ( for instance @xmath45 , with @xmath18 taken as the energy unit ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 a small portion of a typical low - temperature isotherm computed in a @xmath46 porosity sample of size @xmath43 at @xmath41 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the random character of the condensation events results in the fine staircase structure of the curve , with the vertical steps corresponding to the avalanches separated by nearly horizontal portions corresponding to the smooth deformation of the grand - potential local minima ( note the small scale on the vertical axis ) .",
    "the slope of these near - plateaus depends on temperature and its order of magnitude can be estimated from the isothermal compressibility of the pure lattice gas .",
    "it turns out that _ all _ the @xmath12 s vary by a very small amount in these flat portions of the isotherms ( less than @xmath48 ) whereas the vertical steps are due to a significant variation of _ some _ of the @xmath12 s ( a low temperature , this typically corresponds to a gazeous region becoming liquid ) .",
    "we can use this feature to identify the avalanches unambiguously . specifically , we consider that the change @xmath49 in the isotherm is only due to a smooth deformation of a grand - potential minimum when @xmath50 is smaller that some threshold , which we take equal to @xmath51 .",
    "otherwise there is an avalanche , and we associate to it all the sites for which @xmath52 .",
    "the size of the avalanche is then @xmath53 , where the sum is restricted to these sites@xcite ( by taking @xmath54 one would neglect the small increase of @xmath42 which is due to the  smooth \" variation of the @xmath12 s on the other sites of the lattice ) .",
    "this criterium thus implies that avalanches for which @xmath55 can not be detected . by choosing a smaller threshold , e.g. @xmath56 , one may find new avalanches , but their size @xmath57 is very small ( always less than @xmath58 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "avalanches with @xmath59 will not be considered in the following . in any experiment",
    "there is also a threshold below which signals can not be detected .    since one must collect the results of many samples to get a good statistics of the avalanches properties , it is impossible in practice to study a whole isotherm with an increment @xmath32 as small as @xmath60 .",
    "it is much more efficient to proceed by dichotomy , comparing the configurations obtained for two values of @xmath24 , say @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( initially , @xmath61 is a large negative value and @xmath63 , the value at saturation ) . if @xmath64 between the two configurations , one then compares the configurations for @xmath61 and @xmath65 on the one hand , and @xmath65 and @xmath62 on the other hand .",
    "one then looks for an avalanche in the two intervals , and the same procedure is repeated until no avalanche is found between two configurations , or the difference in chemical potential becomes smaller than @xmath60 ( this is the method that was used for obtaining the isotherm shown in fig .",
    "1 , which explains that the points are irregularly spaced ) .    finally , to characterize geometrically an avalanche , which is a random object , one may define an effective  radius of gyration \" @xmath66 by attributing to each site @xmath14 a  mass \" that corresponds to the change in the local density , @xmath67 where the sum is restricted to the sites contributing to the avalanche ( i.e. with @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 is the  center of mass \" of the avalanche@xcite .",
    "let us first study how the number of avalanches with a given size varies with temperature and porosity . to illustrate the general trend , we consider isotherms obtained in @xmath46 and @xmath1 porosity aerogels , as shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) .",
    "the sequence of avalanches was recorded in @xmath70 samples of linear size @xmath43 and @xmath71 samples of linear size @xmath72 , respectively ( this approximately corresponds to the same ratio @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the correlation length of the aerogel@xcite ) . figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) show @xmath75 , the ( unnormalized ) avalanche size distribution ( @xmath76 , the total number of avalanches of size larger than @xmath58 ) . as @xmath8 increases",
    ", @xmath77 decreases from @xmath78 to @xmath79 and from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the size of the largest possible avalanche corresponding to a simultaneous change of all the @xmath12 s from @xmath82 to @xmath17 is @xmath83 .",
    "one thus has @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the @xmath46 and @xmath1 aerogels , respectively .",
    "it is readily seen that there exist much larger avalanches in the lighter aerogel .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the larger void space available , as discussed in our previous papers@xcite . in particular , at @xmath86 , some avalanches span the whole system , signaling that a macroscopic avalanche possibly occurs in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note however that the statistics for very large avalanches is not good , which explains the erratic behavior seen in fig .",
    "3(b ) for large @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , finite - size effects play an important role in the large - porosity / low - temperature regime and they should be taken into account to properly describe the evolution towards the thermodynamic limit ( see ref.@xcite for a careful study in the case of the rfim ) . unfortunately , this would require a considerable amount of numerical work , and we shall therefore only concentrate our discussion on the non - spanning avalanches .",
    "porosity aerogel at @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ( from top to bottom ) ; data correspond to an average over @xmath70 gel samples of size @xmath43 .",
    "( b)corresponding ( unnormalized ) avalanche size distributions @xmath75 .",
    "the solid lines represent the fit @xmath89 ( color on line).,width=377 ]     porosity aerogel at @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ; data correspond to an average over @xmath71 gel samples of size @xmath72 ( color on line).,width=377 ]    figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) show that the evolution of @xmath75 with temperature is quite similar in the two aerogels : as @xmath8 increases , both large _ and _ small avalanches are suppressed , and , as a consequence , the total number @xmath77 decreases .",
    "only the number of avalanches of intermediate size stays roughly constant with @xmath8 .",
    "if one refers to what happens in the field - driven rfim at @xmath31 , this result may appear surprising .",
    "indeed , the isotherms get smoother as one increases the temperature , like the magnetization curves @xmath92 in the rfim as one increases the width of the random field distribution@xcite .",
    "this seems to imply that the temperature plays the role of an effective disorder in the system .",
    "therefore , one would expect that large avalanches become rare as @xmath8 increases ( which is indeed what happens ) , but also that small avalanches proliferate , so that @xmath77 increases on average@xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that temperature also plays another role in our system , a role which is well documented in the literature devoted to capillary condensation@xcite : adsorption in a small cavity becomes more gradual as @xmath8 increases .",
    "specifically , mean - field calculations for a single pore of simple geometry ( for instance a slit of width @xmath93 ) predict that adsorption is continuous and reversible above some critical temperature @xmath94 which decreases as @xmath93 decreases .",
    "since small avalanches are associated with gas condensation in small cavities or crevices defined by the neighboring gel strands , this phenomenon explains the decrease of the number of small avalanches ( when @xmath95 , the temperature at which the hysteresis disappears , there are no avalanches at all and the isotherms become reversible@xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the random - field picture can only be applied at a scale much larger than the correlation length of the solid : schematically , capillary condensation prevails for @xmath96 whereas the disordered character of the aerogel structure plays a major role for @xmath97 .",
    "the two mechanisms compete at the scale @xmath98 which explains that the number of avalanches of intermediate size does not vary significantly with @xmath8 .",
    "if we now concentrate on the disorder - dominated regime , the most remarkable feature , quite visible in the @xmath99 gel at @xmath86 , is that @xmath75 follows an approximate power - law behavior over several decades .",
    "this is the defining signature of criticality , an issue that has been at the focus of intense research activity in recent years , for instance to explain the scaling properties of the barkausen noise in magnetic materials@xcite . in the rfim picture ,",
    "the power - law behavior is related to the existence of a disorder - induced critical point@xcite . in this context",
    ", the avalanche size distribution should be analyzed using the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a critical exponent@xcite , @xmath102 is a scaling function , and @xmath103 a cut - off that depends on the distance to the critical point ( @xmath104 diverges as the critical disorder is approached ) .",
    "our results are however too limited to obtain sensible scaling collapses ( although a crude attempt shows that the scaling function is non - monotonic , in agreement with the rfim behavior@xcite ) .",
    "we simply replace the function @xmath102 by an exponential form only describing the cut - off of the power - law at the scale @xmath104 . figs .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) show the fits of @xmath75 in the two aerogels according to this approximate treatment .",
    "the power - law regime is very limited in the @xmath46 aerogel even at the lowest temperature , indicating that the system is clearly outside the critical region . on the other hand , in the @xmath1 gel ,",
    "the curves show a linear portion on a log - log scale that increases as @xmath8 decreases : the cutoff @xmath104 is pushed to larger values of @xmath57 ( from @xmath105 to @xmath106 as @xmath107 varies from @xmath91 to @xmath88 ) and reaches the box size for @xmath86 ( our set of data is however too limited to estimate the critical exponent associated to the divergence of @xmath104 ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath101 increases and becomes approximately equal to @xmath108 in the fully developed power - law regime at @xmath86 .",
    "taking into account the fact that our systems are small and that @xmath101 in a finite system depends on disorder@xcite , this value does not appear inconsistent with that predicted for the rfim , @xmath109@xcite . in any case , the gel - fluid system is clearly close to criticality at this temperature .     recorded in the @xmath46 porosity samples as a function of chemical potential @xmath24 at @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath110 ( b),title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   recorded in the @xmath46 porosity samples as a function of chemical potential @xmath24 at @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath110 ( b),title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]     porosity samples at @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath111 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]   porosity samples at @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath111 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]    the number and the size of the avalanches along an adsorption isotherm strongly depend on the value of the chemical potential .",
    "we thus also recorded the value of @xmath24 at which each avalanche of size @xmath57 occured . figs .",
    "4 and 5 show the corresponding point clouds in the @xmath46 and @xmath1 gels at @xmath86 and @xmath88 , and @xmath86 and @xmath91 , respectively . as a general rule ,",
    "the size of the largest avalanches increases with @xmath24 , especially in the last stage of the adsorption ( note the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis ) .",
    "but the most striking feature is that avalanches of very different sizes occur in a small interval of @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath46 gel at @xmath86 and @xmath112 , @xmath57 varies from @xmath58 to more than @xmath113 . in the @xmath1 gel at the same temperature and @xmath114 ,",
    "the avalanches span almost all possible sizes between @xmath58 and @xmath115 .",
    "these observations are in complete contradiction with the picture based on the independent pore model which is often used to interpret capillary condensation phenomena@xcite . in this model , only pores of a certain characterisic size @xmath93 fill at a given value of the chemical potential , and the adsorbed fluid density is directly related to the number of pores of this size that can be found in the material .",
    "( one then try to extract from the isotherm the pore size distribution . )",
    "this picture is clearly wrong in the present case because of the very open and intricate character of the gel structure that allows condensation events of very different sizes .",
    "the geometrical characterization of the avalanches is rather difficult . using @xmath116 as",
    "an estimate of the extension of an avalanche is misleading because events with very different shapes are observed ( see for instance figs .",
    "6 and 7 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this variety in the geometry is reflected in the values of the radius of gyration @xmath66 , as defined by eq .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is indeed proportional to the maximal extension of the avalanche , but the prefactor depends on its shape . figs .",
    "6 and 7 show how @xmath66 varies with @xmath57 in the @xmath46 and @xmath1 aerogels .",
    "one can see that avalanches with a similar size may have quite different radii of gyration .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath46 aerogel at @xmath86 , avalanches of size @xmath117 have a radius that varies between @xmath118 and @xmath58 ( note that for a compact object , a factor of @xmath119 in @xmath66 would correspond to a factor @xmath120 in @xmath57 ) .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath1 aerogel at the same temperature , @xmath66 varies from @xmath58 to @xmath121 for avalanches of size @xmath122 .",
    "it is therefore impossible to associate a unique characteristic length to an avalanche of a given size .",
    "moreover , by examining the avalanches that occur in a small interval of @xmath24 , we find that they also have very different radii of gyration .    as the temperature increases , the values of @xmath66 for a given size @xmath57 are less scattered .",
    "indeed , avalanches become more compact as they correspond to condensation events that occur in a single cavity of the aerogel .",
    "this evolution is very clear in the @xmath46 aerogel : at @xmath110 , the radius of gyration of most avalanches is between @xmath119 and @xmath118 and there are almost no avalanches with @xmath66 larger than 6 . on the other hand ,",
    "there is still a large domain of variation of @xmath66 in the @xmath1 aerogel at @xmath111 , and one should go to even higher temperatures to observe a significant reduction .",
    "there is in fact a remarkable resemblance between figs .",
    "6(a ) and 7(b ) which suggests that the avalanche properties are similar apart from a scale factor of about @xmath119 .",
    "the adsorption isotherms have also similar shapes , as can be seen in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) .",
    "this confirms the observation made in ref.@xcite that the adsorption processes in a low porosity gel at low temperature and in high porosity gel at a higher temperature have similar properties .     and size @xmath57 of the avalanches in the @xmath46 porosity samples at @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath110 ( b ) .",

    "this is confirmed by a systematic study of the asphericity parameter which is always smaller than @xmath126@xcite . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6(a ) on a log - log scale , the radius of gyration of these avalanches varies approximately like @xmath127 which is indeed close to the expected value for spherical compact objects ( @xmath128^{1/3}\\approx 0.48 s^{1/3}$ ] for a sphere of radius @xmath129 ) .",

    "8 , most of these avalanches occur at the end of the adsorption process : they thus correspond to the condensation of the last gas bubbles that remain in the large cavities .     of spherical avalanches along the adsorption isotherm in the @xmath46 porosity aerogels at @xmath86 .",

    "although there are also some other remaining bubbles of more complicated shape ( see figs . 7 and 9 in ref.@xcite ) , these spherical avalanches actually represent the only case where one can relate directly the characteristic size of the condensation events to the structure of the aerogel .",
    "we stress again that , in general , the avalanches have a complicated shape so that one can not describe the condensation of the adsorbed gas in terms of  constant curvature bubbles\"@xcite .     as a function of the inverse radius of the spherical avalanches in the @xmath46 and @xmath1 aerogels at @xmath86 and @xmath111 , respectively .",

    "such a description underlies the classical interpretation of capillary condensation based on the kelvin equation@xcite that is commonly used to extract from the isotherms information on the characteristic pore size in the solid .",
    "we thus write the change in the grand potential associated to the condensation of a spherical gas bubble of radius @xmath129 at the chemical potential @xmath24 as@xcite @xmath134 \\frac{4\\pi}{3}r^3-\\gamma 4\\pi r^2\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the corresponding bulk pressure , @xmath136 is the pressure of the metastable liquid at the same chemical potential ( both pressures are computed from the equation of state of the bulk lattice gas ) , and @xmath137 is the ( planar ) liquid - gas surface tension .",
    "all these terms except @xmath129 are temperature dependent . assuming that condensation occurs at equilibrium , the kelvin equation ( in its laplace form ) corresponds to setting @xmath138 in the equation . expanding as usual @xmath139 and @xmath140 about @xmath141 and to first - order in @xmath142 ( which is valid for small undersaturations ) , this yields @xmath143 $ ] , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the densities of the coexisting liquid and gas at this temperature .",

    "this contribution to the adsorption has nothing to do with a critical phenomenon and it is reasonable to eliminate from the scaling plot all the isotherms obtained in the @xmath46 porosity aerogel . more generally , at each temperature , we choose to discard the isotherms that do not belong to the scaling region because the porosity is obviously too far from @xmath176 ( i.e. , the distance from the effective critical disorder is too large ) .",

    "the present calculations indicate that the critical temperature drops very quickly with the porosity , and the extrapolation to @xmath31 predicts that there is no transition at finite temperature in gels of porosity smaller than @xmath244 .",

    "morever , as shown in the preceding section , the avalanche size - distribution has a power - law behavior at @xmath86 , which is the critical temperature extracted from the scaling plot ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "it turns out that the same critical temperature is also obtained by studying the scaling behavior when varying the temperature at fixed porosity .",
    "the scaling is now performed according to the expression    @xmath246    where @xmath247 and @xmath248 and @xmath249 are porosity - dependent scale factors .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "13 that this procedure can only be used with the @xmath1 porosity aerogel .",
    "the scaling plot of the @xmath110 and @xmath239 isotherms is shown in fig .",
    "14 ( again , the @xmath250 isotherm is discarded because of the presence of important finite - size effects ) .",
    "it can be seen that a good scaling is obtained with the same values of the critical exponents as used before . remarkably , the resulting scaling function is also the same and it can be included in fig .",
    "12 by adjusting the scale factors @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "this is a clear indication that the critical behavior of the system is controlled by the same fixed point for all temperatures and porosities .",
    "we now discuss the comparison of all these results with experiments .",
    "in this work and our earlier work@xcite , we have presented a detailed numerical study of the adsorption of @xmath0he in silica aerogel that explains the modification in the shape of the isotherms as the temperature or the porosity is changed .",
    "we have found that the adsorption occurs via a sequence of irreversible condensation events ( avalanches ) of varying size and shape .",
    "the traditional picture of capillary condensation in mesoporous solids in which pores of increasing size fill up successively as the chemical potential or the gas pressure increases does not hold in aerogel , except , approximately , for the special category of spherical avalanches that occur at the end of the adsorption process .",
    "our calculations predict that there exists a line of critical points in the temperature - porosity diagram separating two regimes of continuous and discontinuous adsorption and characterized by a power - law behavior of the avalanche size distribution .",
    "there is a rather large scaling region where adsorption isotherms at different temperatures and different porosities collapse onto a single universal curve .",
    "although the system sizes considered in this work are too small to reach a definite conclusion , the estimated values of the critical exponents seem to be consistent with those of the three - dimensional field - driven rfim at @xmath31@xcite .    the qualitative agreement between the simulated and experimental loops@xcite is a strong argument in favor of the validity of the above scenario .",
    "however , a complete validation still awaits the experimental description of the scaling behavior of the isotherms and the observation of a power - law behavior in the avalanche size distribution .",
    "this latter issue requires some additional comments .",
    "it may be indeed distressing that avalanches have not been observed so far with @xmath0he in aerogel .",
    "in fact , the only exemple of avalanche behavior in adsorption / desorption experiments concerns the draining of superfluid @xmath0he from nuclepore@xcite , a porous material that contains a random spatial distribution of interconnected cylindrical pores . in this case",
    ", superfluidity appears to be a critical factor for the existence and propagation of avalanches via the presence of a superfluid film on the nuclepore substrate that provides a coupling mechanism even between distant pores .",
    "it is likely however that such a mechanism is not necessary for avalanches to occur in aerogels because of very open character of the microstructure .",
    "there are actually several requirements for observing avalanches in sorption experiments , which are all satisfied in the case of the experiments with nuclepore@xcite , but not in the case of the existing aerogel studies@xcite .",
    "let us first recall that , by definition , avalanches correspond to some collective reorganization of the system _ in response _ to a variation of the external driving force . if one is changing the density rather than the chemical potential or the pressure ( by introducing a controlled amount of gas into the sample and then measuring the pressure change ) , the system may follow a different path among the metastable states , and the vertical jumps in the isotherms that are the signature of the avalanches may not be observed@xcite ( this could explain that there are many data points along the adsorption isotherm at @xmath5 in @xmath6 aerogel displayed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "secondly , as already noted , the observation time must be larger than the time the system takes to respond to the change in the external control variable .",
    "this can be done by continuously changing the chemical potential at a very slow rate , and measuring the amount of gas in the solid regularly ( every @xmath238 seconds ) . in practice , this procedure is only possible if the ( local ) equilibration time is short ( for instance , it is smaller than one second with superfluid helium in nuclepore ) .",
    "unfortunately , the relaxation times in aerogel are much longer ( of the order of two hours with @xmath0he at low temperature in the experiments of ref.@xcite ) , and one has to change @xmath24 or @xmath251 by a finite step and keep it fixed until a new local equilibrium ( i.e. , a new metastable state ) is reached . with this procedure , the issue of having a system with a long equilibration time boils down to stability of the experimental conditions and of course patience ; in principle , one could then observe avalanches . yet ,",
    "if @xmath149 or @xmath252 is not small enough , the avalanches may overlap and the resulting isotherm may appear continuous .",
    "this is probably the situation with the experiments in ref.@xcite where @xmath253 ( to be compared with @xmath254 in the nuclepore experiments@xcite ) .",
    "finally , a last requirement is that the sensitivity of the measurements is large enough to discriminate the jumps in the adsorbed fluid density .",
    "this condition is more easily satisfied when these jumps are large enough , which implies that one must be close to the critical line displayed in fig .",
    "although one must be very cautious in comparing our temperature scale with the true experimental one , it seems that this last condition is also not satisfied in the existing experiments .",
