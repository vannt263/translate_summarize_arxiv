    "hierarchical models of structure formation , in which galaxies formed at high redshift and rapidly coalesced into groups and clusters through accretion and mergers , have become a compelling paradigm for understanding galaxy evolution . in such dynamically rich environments , galaxies are subject to an array of physical processes that affect their evolution .",
    "these physical processes form two broad classes : ( 1 ) tidal interactions such as those induced by major mergers ( e.g. , lavery & henry 1988 ) , off - axis galaxy collisions ( mller et  al .",
    "1989 ) , galaxy harassment ( moore et  al .  1996 ) or galaxy fly - bys near the core of the cluster potential ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) , and ( 2 ) gas - gas interactions , notably ram pressure by the intracluster gas ( icm ) on the galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) , due to the galaxy s motion through the surrounding icm ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , or ism - ism interactions produced in galaxy - galaxy collisions ( kenney et  al .",
    "these gas - dynamical processes may be enhanced by turbulence and viscous effects ( nulsen 1982 ; quilis et  al .",
    "2000 ) or inhomogeneities and bulk motions in the icm gas ( kenney et  al .  2004 ) . combes ( 2004 ) and references therein provide a recent overview .",
    "no model for galaxy evolution can be complete without a detailed understanding of the gas - dynamics of these interactions .",
    "similarly no model for the evolution of the intracluster medium can be complete without understanding the feedback of gas and energy from the galaxy into the icm by these gravitational and hydrodynamical stripping processes .",
    "the actions of tidal forces are identified by the appearance of disturbed stellar morphologies , such as stretched stellar tails ( see e.g. gnedin 2003 , vollmer 2003 ) ; while the characteristic signatures of hydrodynamic stripping ( see e.g. stevens et  al .",
    "1999 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ; acreman et  al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) are imprinted on the structure of the hot x - ray emitting gas in and near the galaxy . notably the ram - pressure experienced by galaxies moving through the dense icm can produce sharp surface brightness edges ( `` cold fronts '' ) along the leading interface between the galaxy and the icm ( acreman et  al .  2003 ; machacek et  al .",
    "these cold fronts are contact discontinuities where a sharp rise in surface brightness ( gas density ) is accompanied by a corresponding drop in gas temperature , and are the galaxy - sized analogues of similar subcluster - scale features identified near the cores of rich clusters ( see e.g. markevitch et  al .",
    "2000 , vikhlinin et  al .  2001",
    "; mazzotta et  al .",
    "the higher pressure found in the cold front compared to that in the cluster gas is balanced by the ram pressure caused by the motion of the cloud ( in our case , galaxy ) through the surrounding icm .",
    "tails of stripped galaxy gas have been found to extend @xmath18 to @xmath19kpc behind the galaxy before fading into the background emission of the ambient cluster gas ( see e.g. forman et  al .  1979 , white et  al .",

    "1996 for 4c34.16 ; wang et  al .  2004 for c153 ; machacek et  al .  2005a , scharf et  al .",
    "2005 for ngc  1404 ) .",
    "detailed studies of these x - ray features in nearby systems ( see , for example , biller et  al .  2004 ; machacek et  al .  2005a , 2005b ; sun & vikhlinin 2005 ; sun , jerius & jones 2005 ) , made possible by the high angular resolution of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , not only reveal the nature of the gas - dynamics of the stripping process , but also are one of the few ways to constrain the three dimensional motion of the galaxy as it passes through the group or cluster core ( merrifield 1998 ; dosaj et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "ngc  4552 ( @xmath20,@xmath21 , j2000 ) is an elliptical galaxy located @xmath22 east of m87 in subcluster a of the virgo cluster .",
    "measurement of ngc  4552 s distance modulus using surface brightness fluctuations ( tonry et  al .",
    "2001 ) places it at nearly the same luminosity distance as m87 , while ngc  4552 s low line of sight velocity ( @xmath23kms@xmath15 , ned ; smith et  al .",
    "2000 ) compared to that of m87 ( @xmath24kms@xmath15 , ned ; smith et  al .",
    "2000 ) implies that ngc  4552 is moving supersonically through the virgo icm with at least @xmath25kms@xmath15towards us relative to m87 .",
    "thus ngc  4552 is a likely candidate for ram - pressure stripping by the cluster gas .    since ngc  4552 is a member of the large sample of nearby elliptical galaxies used to establish correlations between x - ray emission and other ism tracers ( see e.g. osullivan et  al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , its global x - ray properties are well studied .",
    "early observations with the _ einstein _ observatory ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; canizares , fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ; roberts et  al .  1991",
    "; kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ; eskridge , fabbiano , & kim 1995 ) focused on the measurement of ngc  4552 s total x - ray luminosity to establish the @xmath26 @xmath27 relation .",
    "subsequent _ rosat _ observations of ngc  4552 were used to study the possible dependence of this relation on environment ( brown & bregman 2000 ; osullivan et  al .",
    "fits to the mean x - ray spectrum for ngc  4552 using _",
    "rosat _ resulted in mean temperatures for the x - ray gas in the galaxy of @xmath28kev depending on the spectral model ( davis & white 1996 ; brown & bregman 2000 ; matsushita 2001 ) . using _",
    "asca _ data ,",
    "matsushita , ohashi , & makishima ( 2000 ) modelled the mean spectrum of ngc  4552 using variable abundance thermal plasma models including an additional bremsstrahlung component in the spectral models to account for the contribution of unresolved point sources in low spatial resolution data .",
    "they found mean temperatures @xmath29kev for ngc  4552 , in agreement with the _ rosat _ studies , but with generally higher abundances ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "most recent studies , across a wide range of wavelengths , have concentrated on the nuclear properties of ngc  4552 .",
    "a brief review of prior work on the nucleus can be found in machacek et  al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter known as paper ii ) , where we present our results from chandra observations of the central regions of ngc  4552 that show shocks close to the center of ngc  4552 that were produced by recent nuclear activity .    in this paper we use _ chandra _ x - ray observations to focus on the properties of gas in the outer regions of ngc  4552 where hydrodynamic gas stripping is occuring .",
    "our discussion is organized as follows : in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and our data reduction and processing procedures . in  [ sec : ramresult ] we present the background subtracted , exposure corrected image of ngc  4552 showing the prominent x - ray emission features of the system : a sharp surface brightness edge to the north , horns of emission extending away to the south from the surface brightness edge , a ram pressure stripped x - ray tail , a bright nucleus , and bright ringlike features ( discussed in detail in paper ii ) near the galaxy center .",
    "we then discuss our analysis method and main results , including the determination of the gas density and temperature , for gas stripping from the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "we use these results to constrain the velocity of ngc  4552 through the virgo icm . in  [ sec : conclude ] we summarize our results . unless otherwise indicated all errors correspond to @xmath31 confidence levels and coordinates are j2000 . taking the distance to the dominant elliptical m87 as representative of the distance to subcluster a of the virgo cluster containing ngc  4552",
    ", the luminosity distance to the cluster is @xmath32mpc ( tonry et  al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath33 corresponds to a distance scale of @xmath34pc .",
    "for our analysis , we used a @xmath0ks observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4552 in virgo taken with _",
    "chandra _ on 2001 april 22 using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer array ( acis , garmire et  al .",
    "1992 ; bautz et  al .",
    "1998 ) with acis - s ( chip s3 ) at the aimpoint .",
    "the focal plane temperature of the instrument was @xmath35c throughout the observation .",
    "the data were analyzed using the standard x - ray processing packages , ciao version @xmath2 , ftools and xspec version @xmath36 .",
    "filtering removed events with bad grades ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) and those with significant flux in border pixels of the @xmath40 event islands ( vfaint mode ) , as well as any events falling on hot pixels .",
    "use of vfaint mode improves background rejection by as much as a factor of @xmath41 in the s3 chip for soft x - ray energies ( @xmath42kev ) important to this observation .",
    "the data were reprocessed and response files created using the most recent gain tables and instrumental corrections .",
    "these included correcting for the time - dependent declining efficiency of the acis detector due to the buildup of contaminants on the optical filter ( plucinsky et  al .",
    "2003 ) , which is important at energies below @xmath43kev , and for the slow secular drift ( tgain ) of the average pha values for photons of fixed energy .",
    "periods of anomalously high background ( flares ) were identified and removed from the data , along with periods of anomalously low count rates at the beginning and end of the observation .",
    "this resulted in a useful exposure time of @xmath44s .",
    "backgrounds for use in the imaging analyses and spectral measurements of the virgo cluster gas were created from the @xmath45ks period d source free dataset ( aciss_d_7_bg_evt_271103 ) appropriate for the date of observation and instrument configuration .. identical cleaning , energy and spatial filters were applied to source and background data throughout .",
    "we checked the standard normalization of the source free background , set by the ratio of the exposure times , by comparing count rates between the source and background files in the @xmath46kev energy range , where particle background dominates .",
    "we found the standard normalization was @xmath47 too high and renormalized the source free data by a factor of @xmath48 to correct for this difference .",
    "point sources were identified in the @xmath49 field of the s3 chip in the @xmath50kev energy band using a multiscale wavelet decomposition algorithm set with a @xmath51 detection threshold .",
    "the resulting @xmath52 source identifications were excluded from the spectral and surface brightness analyses that follow .",
    "in figure [ fig : image ] we present the @xmath1kev _ chandra _ image of the diffuse emission in ngc  4552 overlaid with x - ray surface brightness contours showing the x - ray features of interest for our analysis .",
    "point sources were removed from the image and the point source regions filled with the local average emission level using ciao tool _ dmfilth_. the image was then background subtracted , corrected for telescope vignetting and detector response using exposure maps created with standard ciao tools .",
    "first , two narrow band ( @xmath53 and @xmath54kev ) images were background subtracted and exposure corrected using monoenergetic instrument maps of @xmath55 and @xmath43kev , respectively .",
    "the fluxed narrow band images were then summed and smoothed with a @xmath33 gaussian kernel to produce the image in figure 1 .",
    "we chose conservative gaussian smoothing for our images to minimize potential numerical artifacts from the smoothing algorithm .",
    "the @xmath33 smoothing scale represents a compromise between the need for high spatial resolution to map sharp or narrow features and the need to smooth over larger scales to highlight faint extended emission features .",
    "we see a sharp , flattened discontinuity ( edge ) in the surface brightness @xmath2kpc ( @xmath56 ) north of ngc  4552 s center .",
    "horns of emission extend @xmath57kpc ( @xmath58 ) to the southeast and southwest away from each side of the flattened edge .",
    "an x - ray tail extends @xmath6kpc ( @xmath59 ) to the south - southeast before becoming indistinguishable from the ambient icm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hehwtsig ] we show projections across the horns and tail in a @xmath60kev image of the diffuse emission ( binned to pixel size @xmath61 but without background subtraction ) , demonstrating that these features are highly significant .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : image ] an enhanced region of x - ray emission in the southwest quadrant of the galaxy , near the beginning of the tail , that we denote as the southern lump sl . in figure [",
    "fig : panda ] we show the @xmath60kev emission in the galaxy for radii @xmath62 in @xmath63 equal sectors numbered counterclockwise from @xmath37 .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : panda ] , x - ray emission from the outer radii of the galaxy is very asymmetric .",
    "enhanced soft emission occurs both in the northen galaxy regions ( sectors @xmath64 ) , behind the leading edge of the galaxy , and in the southern galaxy regions ( sectors @xmath65 ) near the beginning of the tail .",
    "the peak in the soft emission for these regions occurs in the southwest quadrant of the galaxy in sectors @xmath66 , at the position of the southern lump ( sl ) .",
    "thus we see that the southern lump sl , as well as the horns and the tail , is also highly significant .",
    "disturbed x - ray morphologies may arise from tidal interactions caused by a recent or ongoing merger , winds of outflowing material due to a recent starburst , or outflows from a central agn , as well as from ram pressure stripping of the galaxy ism due to the motion of the galaxy through the ambient virgo icm .",
    "for ngc  4552 these first three scenarios are disfavored .",
    "tidal ( gravitational ) interactions act on both stars and gas , producing characteristic stellar tidal streams or tails ( gnedin 2003 ; combes 2004 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for disturbed morphology in the stellar distribution of ngc  4552 or for significant extragalactic stellar light that might result , if the observed features were of tidal origin ( bettoni et  al .",
    "2003 ) .    a second possibility , given the classification of ngc  4552 as a transition nucleus ( ho et  al .",
    "1997 ) , is that the distorted x - ray morphology may be due to winds from a compact nuclear starburst .",
    "however , the transition nucleus classification for ngc  4552 is weak , due to @xmath67 uncertainties in the measurement of the h@xmath68 line emission ( ho et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and the radio spectrum of ngc  4552 is inconsistent with that expected from such a starburst .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4552 exhibits a compact core radio source with a flat spectrum , whose peak brightness temperature of @xmath69k  ( filho et  al .",
    "2004 ) is several orders of magnitude above the @xmath70k  upper limit ( condon et  al .",
    "1991 ) for the brightness temperature of a compact nuclear starburst .",
    "in addition , starburst winds tend to produce conical outflows with associated optical line ( h@xmath71 ) emission from the interaction between the supernova driven ejecta and the surrounding ism ( see , e.g. , strickland et  al .",
    "2000 for ngc 253 and cecil , bland - hawthorn & veilleux 2002 for ngc 3079 ) , which are not seen in ngc  4552 .",
    "a third possibility is that agn outbursts could be responsible for the distorted x - ray morphology seen at large radii in ngc  4552 .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4552 does harbor a supermassive black hole ( filho et  al .",
    "2004 ) and does undergo outbursts , as evidenced by the ring structures seen in figure [ fig : image ] and analyzed in detail in paper ii . however , the x - ray signatures of such outbursts are residual bright - rimmed cavities and buoyant bubbles , as found in m87 ( e.g. , forman et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and/or x - ray edges corresponding to shocks driven into the ambient medium by the outburst ( e.g. , fabian et  al .",
    "2003 for ngc  1275 in perseus and nulsen et  al .",
    "2005 for hydra a ) .",
    "this is quite different from the ` flattened leading edge - trailing tail ' morphology seen in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "in contrast , the qualitative correspondence between the main x - ray features shown in figure [ fig : image ] , i.e. the leading edge , horns , and tail , and those found in simulations ( e.g. see stevens et  al .  1999 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ; acreman et  al .",
    "2003 ) of ram - pressure stripping of elliptical galaxies moving through surrounding cluster gas is striking .",
    "however , since none of these simulations model the specific galaxy , orbital , or cluster characteristics of ngc  4552 in virgo , only a qualitative , not quantitative , comparison of these simulations to our observation should be made . for supersonic stripping ,",
    "the galaxy ism is initially pushed back and fanned out ( stevens et  al .  1999 ,",
    "model 1b , figure 2 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 , figure 3 ; acreman et  al .",
    "2003 , figure 2c , @xmath72gyr slice ) causing the edge between the galaxy gas and the icm to flatten , as is seen for ngc  4552 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) . this sharp surface brightness discontinuity",
    ", @xmath2kpc north of the galaxy s center , coupled with a gas tail in the opposite direction , fixes the galaxy s direction of motion in the plane of the sky .",
    "irregular filaments of stripped material also are seen in simulation images extending back from the leading edge , similar to the horns we observe in ngc  4552 .",
    "these filaments signal the onset of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , where stripping is occurring at the boundary between galaxy and icm gas . in the simulation images , galaxy gas , once stripped and decelerated ,",
    "forms a distinctive tail of emission behind the galaxy , again similar to what we see in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "the three - dimensional simulations of toniazzo & schindler ( 2001 ) demonstrate that the tail is in general not axisymmetric with respect to the direction of motion , but may appear angular or curved , as is also found in our image .",
    "thus the most likely explanation for the origin of the features shown in figure [ fig : image ] is ram - pressure stripping of galaxy gas due to the motion of ngc  4552 through the virgo cluster icm . in order to investigate quantitatively these complex gas - dynamical processes and test our ram - pressure - stripping hypothesis",
    ", we first determine the spectral properties and densities of hot gas in the surrounding icm and in ngc  4552 s main emission features .",
    "spectral extraction regions were chosen to isolate , as much as possible given our limited photon statistics , emission from the individual features .",
    "the geometries of these spectral extraction regions are listed in table [ tab : specregs ] and are shown in figure [ fig : specimage ] .",
    "these regions are he and hw for the eastern and western horns extending from the northern surface brightness edge to either side of the galaxy , oa for galaxy emission at large radii but inside the northern edge , sl for the region ( lump ) of enhanced emission in the southwestern quadrant of ngc  4552 , and t for the tail of emission extending from the galaxy to the south .",
    "to determine source existence , one compares the source plus background counts in a region to that expected from the background alone .",
    "we also can determine how well the flux can be measured for each feature .",
    "we compute both these statistics for regions he , hw , sl , and t. the background regions we used to compute these measures are listed in table [ tab : bgsigregs ] , and the respective areas and observed counts are given in table [ tab : fluxsigdat ] .",
    "we note that the background region ( sl_bg ) used for region sl , that is embedded in the galaxy , was a neighboring region that included the surrounding galaxy emission .",
    "neighboring virgo cluster emission regions were used as local backgrounds to compute these statistics for features he , hw , and t , since those regions extend outward from ngc  4552 into the virgo cluster emission . for each region",
    "we find that the cumulative poisson probability that the observed or greater number of counts could have arisen from a fluctuation of the expected background is @xmath73 .",
    "thus the detection of these features is highly significant .",
    "the precision to which the flux can be measured for each feature is given in table [ tab : fluxsigdat ] , as the net source counts and the total uncertainty in each measurement .",
    "for the analysis below , since the spectra for gas in ngc  4552 and in the x - ray tail are soft , we restrict the spectral fit energy range for the tail ( t ) , horns ( he+hw ) and galaxy regions outside the rings to @xmath74kev , where the source count rates are above background .",
    "we initially separated the outer annular region ( oa ) for ngc  4552 into two separate rectangular regions , one just inside the northern leading edge ( ng ) and one to the south near the beginning of the tail ( sg ) , to look for temperature differences between these two regions .",
    "however , since we found no statistically significant difference between the spectral fits for these regions ( see table [ tab : allspectra ] ) , we combined them into the annular region ( oa ) shown , in order to improve statistics and sharpen our measurement of the temperature and abundance for galaxy gas outside the central region .",
    "we chose a @xmath75 rectangular region ( vn ) centered @xmath76 north of ngc  4552 , comprising approximately @xmath77 of the area of the s3 chip , to determine the spectrum of the virgo cluster gas in the vicinity of ngc  4552 .",
    "we fit the spectrum for the virgo icm ( region vn ) over the full @xmath78kev energy band , where the s3 detector has good efficiency .",
    "we fix the hydrogen absorbing column at @xmath79@xmath80 , the galactic value ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and allow the temperature , abundance and normalization to vary .",
    "we find the temperature of the virgo cluster icm to be @xmath81kev with metal abundance @xmath82 .",
    "we then allowed the absorbing column to vary and found no suggestion for increased absorption .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with previous spectral analyses of the virgo cluster icm using data from _ ginga _ ( takano et  al .",
    "1989 ) , _ rosat _ ( bhringer et  al .",
    "1994 ) , and _ asca _ ( ohashi et  al .",
    "1998 , shibata et  al .  2001 ) , that find , with galactic hydrogen absorption , temperatures @xmath83kev and metal abundances of @xmath84 , at projected distances ( @xmath85kpc from m87 ) comparable to that of ngc  4552 .",
    "we note that the temperature and x - ray emissivity of the virgo icm are relatively insensitive to the metal abundance over the abundance range ( @xmath86 ) determined by our fit .",
    "if we allow the abundance to vary over this range , we find variations in the virgo icm temperature of @xmath87kev , within the @xmath31 confidence level for the canonical fit , and variations in the inferred @xmath1kev x - ray emissivity for the cluster gas of @xmath88 .",
    "region vn also was used as a local background region for galaxy source regions at large radii ( ng , sg , oa , sl ) , the horns ( hw+he ) and the tail ( t ) , to remove contamination from virgo cluster emission . for spectral fitting , counts were grouped both by using predefined bins resulting in channels of approximately logarithmic width , and by using a minimum @xmath89 counts per bin .",
    "both methods gave consistent spectral model fits .",
    "the spectra for all of the above regions are well represented by single - temperature apec or vapec thermal plasma models ( smith et  al .",
    "2001 ) corrected for absorption using wisconsin photo - electric cross - sections ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) . our results for these regions are summarized in table [ tab : allspectra ] .",
    "we checked that our results were not sensitive to the position of the local background region ( vn ) on the detector by recomputing the spectral fits using a second @xmath90 circular region @xmath91 east of ngc  4552 ( ve in table [ tab : specregs ] ) and found no significant differences in the fitted parameters .",
    "we also fit the spectra to these regions using blank sky backgrounds ( as for vn ) and a two component apec + apec model .",
    "we fixed the temperature and abundance of one apec component at our best fit values for the virgo cluster emission ( @xmath92kev and @xmath93 , see table [ tab : allspectra ] ) , while allowing the temperature and abundance of the second apec component and both component normalizations to vary , and found consistent results .",
    "thus our results are not biased by our choice of vn as the local background .",
    "since the models agree within their @xmath31 cl , we present only those results ( using background region vn ) for the tail and galaxy emission at large radii in table [ tab : allspectra ] .      for fixed galactic absorption , we find the temperature and abundance of the outer galaxy gas in region oa to be @xmath94kev and @xmath95 , a metallicity marginally higher than that for the virgo icm , but with large uncertainty . to check the stability of the fit , we allowed the absorbing column to vary and found no suggestion for increased absorption above the galactic value . to assess the effect of any residual unresolved x - ray binaries on our results",
    ", we also fit the spectrum for region oa , galaxy emission within the northern edge , over the @xmath96kev energy range with an absorbed two component model consisting of an apec component for emission from the diffuse gas and a @xmath38kev bremsstrahlung component to model unresolved x - ray binaries ( kraft et  al .",
    "we fix the hydrogen absorbing column at its galactic value , while allowing the temperature and abundance in the apec component and both component normalizations to vary .",
    "we find that the fitted temperature ( @xmath97kev ) and abundance ( @xmath98 ) for the thermal component in this two component model agree , within their @xmath31 confidence limits , with the single apec model results listed in table [ tab : allspectra ] .",
    "the bremsstrahlung ( unresolved binary ) component contributes only @xmath99 to the @xmath1kev luminosity of region oa .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical expectations for the contribution of x - ray binaries to the flux in region oa found by integrating the average x - ray luminosity function for lmxb s ( gilfanov , 2004 ) below our observed @xmath100  kev point source detection threshold ( @xmath101ergs@xmath15@xmath80 ) in that region .",
    "thus , the effects of residual unresolved x - ray binaries on the measured properties of the diffuse gas in region oa do not bias the single temperature apec model results for the properties of the galaxy gas which are important to our analysis .",
    "we find that the temperature of the ism on the galaxy side of the ( leading ) northern edge ( @xmath102kev ) is a factor @xmath103 lower than the temperature of the gas in the ambient virgo icm ( @xmath104kev ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : image ] , this temperature drop corresponds to a sharp increase in surface brightness ( and thus gas density as quantified in ",
    "[ sec : sboutprofile ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the northern edge as a cold front , the leading edge of the galaxy ism as it undergoes ram pressure stripping , in broad agreement with expectations from simulations ( e.g. see stevens et  al .  1999 ,",
    "figure 2 , model 1b ; acreman et  al .",
    "2003 , figures 10a & c and 11b & d , @xmath105gyr time slice ) .",
    "figures [ fig : image ] and [ fig : panda ] show a bright region ( lump ) of emission in the outer southwest quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "we use a @xmath106 circular region centered at ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) surrounding the lump ( region sl in figure [ fig : specimage ] ) to isolate the spectrum for this region .",
    "although we find , using an apec model with galactic absorption , a temperature @xmath109kev and abundance @xmath110 formally consistent with the properties of galaxy gas elsewhere outside the central rings in ngc  4552 , the @xmath111 is large .",
    "the fit is improved ( @xmath112 ) by using an absorbed vapec model with a higher iron abundance , while fixing all other abundances at @xmath113 , the mean abundance for the galaxy ism in region oa .",
    "the hydrogen absorbing column remained fixed at the galactic value .",
    "we include this fit in table [ tab : allspectra ] . in this vapec model ,",
