    "tunnel fets ( tfets ) are strong candidates for future electronics applications due to their promise of low power consumption originating from their subthreshold - swing ( ss ) being less than the conventional limit of 60 mv / dec @xcite .",
    "however , tfets usually suffer from lower on - currents if compared to ultra - scaled mosfets @xcite , since their currents are the result of the tunneling process . to overcome the low on - current challenge",
    ", two obvious solutions are : 1 ) increasing the electric field at the tunnel junction , 2 ) decreasing the band gap and effective mass of the channel material .",
    "however , reducing the band gap increases the off - current of the device and limits the maximum allowable supply voltage v@xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , there is a lower limit on the band gap for any v@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "previous approaches for increasing the electric field at the tunnel junction included using an internal field ( i.e. piezo - electric field ) in nitride heterostructures @xcite or employing 2d channel materials with tight gate control @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a new method for increasing the electric field is proposed .",
    "it is shown that using a low - k dielectric next to high - k dielectrics can , in principle , increase the electric field in homo - junction tfets significantly .",
    "the structure of the dielectric engineered tfet ( de - tfet ) is shown in fig .",
    "at the interface between the dielectrics , the displacement vector should be continuous ( @xmath3 ) . with @xmath4 ,",
    "the low - k dielectric has a larger electric field @xmath5 as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b . since the high electric field region occurs right at the top of the tunnel junction , the on - current of the device",
    "is amplified .",
    "notice that the same idea ( combination of high - k and low - k dielectrics ) can be used in other device structures ; e.g. gate - all - around , double and single gated tfets .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c compares the potential profile for a _ conventional _ electrically doped tfet ( ed - tfet ) @xcite with that of a de - tfet . in case of the ed - tfets , the width of the potential spread is proportional to the total thickness of the device @xmath6 ( the body thickness plus the oxide thickness shown as @xmath6 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1]c and [ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "in contrast , most of the potential drop in the de - tfet occurs over the width of the low - k dielectric region ( labeled as @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : opt1 ] ) compares the average electric field of a _ conventional _ ed - tfet with that of the de - tfet showing a possible gain in the electric field for the de - tfet ( as long as @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 furthermore , the de - tfet offers several other advantages : 1 ) the performance is not very sensitive to the spacing ( shown as @xmath7 in fig .",
    "1 ) when @xmath7 is chosen around the optimum value , in contrast to the _ conventional _ ed - tfet in which the on - current decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath7 @xcite ( i.e. lack of optimum @xmath7 : @xmath12 ) .",
    "2 ) increasing the oxide thickness does not deteriorate the performance of the device , while the performance of electrically doped devices strongly depends on the thickness @xcite .",
    "3 ) there is no need for chemical doping which means the de - tfet does not exhibit the drawbacks of chemically doped devices @xcite",
    "( i.e. dopant states in the bandgap which deteriorate the off - state performance and ss in addition to the disorder introduced by fluctuations in dopant locations ) .",
    "note that despite the oxide thickness having less impact on the performance of the de - tfets compared to ed - tfets , a thinner oxide is still slightly beneficial for an improved on - state .    0.25   [ fig : struct1 ]    0.25   [ fig : same_eot ]    in section iii , full - band quantum transport simulations are performed on a monolayer wte@xmath0 homojunction de - tfet to investigate its performance .",
    "the performance sensitivity of the de - tfets to the spacing , thickness , and channel material ( wse@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 ) is discussed by both analytic modeling and numerical simulations in section iv .",
    "to represent wse@xmath0 and wte@xmath0 as channel materials of the de - tfet atomistically , we have utilized a sp@xmath13d@xmath14 2nd nearest neighbor tight - binding model with spin - orbit coupling .",

    "chemical doping can introduce dopant states within the band gap @xcite , and hetero - junctions often suffer from interface states .",
    "both of these effects increase ss of the device .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b shows the conduction and valence band profiles of the wte@xmath0 de - tfet .",
    "the electric field at the tunnel junction is about 0.9 v / nm .",

    "[ fig : fig2]d compares the performance sensitivity of the wte@xmath0 de - tfet with the conventional ed - tfet .",
    "the performance of the de - tfet is much less sensitive to oxide thickness variations if compared to the conventional ed - tfet .",
    "it is apparent that the width of the low - k dielectric ( @xmath7 ) affects the performance of de - tfets .",
    "when @xmath7 equals 0 , the device converts to a conventional ed - tfet and the electric field at the tunnel junction reduces . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath7 becomes very large , the electric field reduces to 0 . accordingly",
    ", there exists an optimum spacing where the electric field is high .",
    "notice that achieving the highest electric field is not a sufficient condition to ensure best performance .",
    "for example , if the electric field is high only over a very small distance such that the potential drop across the low - k dielectric is not large enough ( compared to the band gap ) , then the tunneling window with high field will be small .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a shows the conduction band profile for a wte@xmath0 de - tfet with different spacing values .",
    "the lower the spacing , the higher is the electric field .",
    "however , this does not always translate into better performance .",
    "for example , a spacing of 0.5 nm has a larger electric field compared to the spacing of 1.0 nm but the energy window with high electric field of @xmath20 case is smaller than that of @xmath21 .    to understand the impact of low - k spacing @xmath7 on the potential profile and performance , an analytic model is developed . for the case of @xmath22",
    ", it was previously proven that the potential can be described by a @xmath23 dependence with @xmath24 @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the channel thickness is assumed to be 0 first ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "later on , an empirical term is added to include the impact of @xmath26 .",
    "simulations reveal that in the case of de - tfets , the potential is linear within the low - k dielectric as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b .",
    "accordingly , the potential profile can be approximated as : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the potential drop across the low - k dielectric and @xmath29 is the position of the center of the low - k dielectric . to determine @xmath28 ,",
