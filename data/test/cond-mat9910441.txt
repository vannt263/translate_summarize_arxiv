    "an important trend in the condensed matter physics of the last two decades , has been the use of advanced field - theoretical methods to discuss various subtle and fundamental properties of interacting many - particle systems at low temperatures .",
    "there are several reasons for this trend .",
    "the first reason is of course , that a traditional topic in statistical and condensed matter physics is the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena , for which the universal properties are independent of the microscopic details of the system and can therefore be determined by a field theory describing only the large - scale properties of the system of interest . since the latter",
    "are usually solely determined by symmetry considerations , this has led to the important concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which has turned out to be not only highly successful in condensed matter physics , but also in high - energy physics and in particular in the standard model of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "a second reason is that soon after the development of the renormalization group methods for critical phenomena @xcite , it was realized that the same methods can in fact be used to describe the large - scale properties of many - particle systems at any temperature and not only near the critical one .",
    "moreover , application of the renormalization group ideas does not only lead to an understanding of the static behaviour but also of the dynamical properties @xcite . as a result",
    "quantum field theories can be used to conveniently determine the dynamics of many - particle systems close to equilibrium , i.e. , for example the linear hydrodynamical equations of motion . in addition",
    ", it can even be used in highly nonequilibrium situations where in general also nonlinearities play an important role .",
    "this feature , that also the dynamics of the system can be captured by a quantum field theory , has for instance led in recent years to the study of so - called quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "finally , the importance of field - theoretical methods in condensed matter physics is associated with the observation that also the effects of imperfections , i.e. , disorder , can be treated in this way @xcite .",
    "apart from the technological importance of disorder , for example for superconducting magnets , disorder leads also to fundamentally new physics such as the phenomenon of localization @xcite . in quantum hall systems",
    ", a combination of disorder and interaction effects give rise to the realization of various peculiar quantum fluids with fractionally charged excitations @xcite .",
    "the application of field theories has proven to be highly successful in this case and has led to a theory of the quantum hall effect in terms of edge states that form a chiral luttinger liquid @xcite . in mesoscopic physics , the study of disorder in small electronic structures has resulted in the so - called random matrix theory @xcite , which has also been of much use in the study of the quantization of classically chaotic systems .",
    "in this course we aim to show that quantum field theory is also very convenient for obtaining a detailed understanding of the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of trapped atomic gases .",
    "after the first observations of bose - einstein condensation in 1995 @xcite , degenerate atomic gases have received again a great deal of attention and are presently the main subject of study of a large number of experimental and theoretical groups around the world .",
    "the reason for all this excitement is , first of all , that bose - einstein condensation has never before been observed experimentally in a clear - cut manner , even though this phenomenon was already predicted by einstein in 1925 @xcite .",
    "second , it is of fundamental interest because it is the only phase transition that occurs also in the absense of interactions and is , therefore , the textbook example for the use of statistical - physics methods . finally , the goal of achieving bose - einstein condensation turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated at first . just before the breakthrough in 1995",
    ", it had even acquired the nature of a ` quest for the holy grail ' , since the pioneering experiments were already performed in 1980 @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a quantitative understanding of the experiments with cold atomic gases requires that we take into account the following two effects .",
    "first , the gas is magnetically trapped in an , usually axially symmetric , harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "this is necessary because , in order to obtain the required record low temperatures of @xmath0  nk , the gas can not be allowed to have any contact with material walls .",
    "second , the atoms of the gas interact with each other , which in general dramatically affects the behaviour of the condensed gas , even at the relevant low densities of @xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "an accurate description of these degenerate gases thus requires the solution of a highly inhomogeneous many - body problem .",
    "the theoretical challenge posed by these new quantum systems lies therein that the density of the gas is sufficiently small that it should be possible to accurately solve this many - body problem from first principles and to compare the outcome of the theory directly with experiment , i.e. , without any adjustable parameters . in our opinion ,",
    "quantum field theory is the most simple way in which we are able to meet this challenge .",
    "we start our development of the quantum field theory of trapped atomic gases by considering first the equilibrium properties of these gases .",
    "we consider both bose and fermi gases , and the ultimate aim of this section is to arrive , for both cases , at an accurate description of the normal and superfluid phases of the gas .",
    "although mixtures of bose and fermi gases are also of current interest , we do not consider them explicitly here , because they can be treated by a straightforward generalization of the theory . in section [ nft ]",
    "we then turn to the nonequilibrium properties , which are perhaps the most interesting and certainly the least understood at present .",
    "the reason for organizing the course in this way , is that the development of the equilibrium theory gives us an opportunity to introduce all the necessary tools that are required for a treatment of the more complicated nonequilibrium case . in particular , we present in detail the way in which we can make use of functional methods . to make also a connection with the more familiar operator language , however",
    ", we first briefly summarize the outcome of the second quantization formalism .",
    "the atoms of interest to us have internal degrees of freedom due to the electron and nuclear spins . in principle",
    "this is very important , because it gives the atom a magnetic moment , which is used to trap the atoms in a magnetic field minumum . during this course , however , we restrict ourselves to atomic gases that are a mixture of at most two hyperfine states . without loss of generality",
    ", we can then suppose to have @xmath3 identical atoms with mass @xmath4 and effective spin @xmath5 in an external potential @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation we have to solve is @xmath7 where the hamiltonian is @xmath8 @xmath9_- = i\\hbar$ ] , and all other commutators of the positions and momenta vanish .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side is the sum of the one - particle hamiltonians , which includes an effective zeeman interaction that accounts for a possible difference in the hyperfine energies .",
    "the second term represents the interactions . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the interaction @xmath10 is independent of the hyperfine states of the atoms @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is in general not justified for realistic atomic gases , but is valid for the specific applications that we have in mind . moreover , in section [ hft ] we also discuss the general case . finally , we have also neglected possible three - body forces .",
    "this is a result of the fact that we are interested in dilute quantum gases , for which it is highly improbable for three atoms to simultaneously interact with each other .    without interactions the eigenstates",
    "are , of course , given by the states @xmath13 , where the specific quantum state for each atom is exactly known . here",
    "@xmath14 and the nonnegative integers @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denote the three quantum numbers that are required to specify the one - particle eigenstates in the external potential .",
    "the wave functions and energies of these eigenstates are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and are found from the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath20 in addition , the internal state @xmath21 is a shorthand notation for @xmath22 .",
    "the many - body wave function @xmath23 , however , has to be symmetric or antisymmetric under permutations for bosonic or fermionic atoms , respectively .",
    "therefore it is more convenient to use a properly ( anti)symmetrized version of the above basis , i.e. , the states @xmath24 with the occupation numbers @xmath25 for bosons and @xmath26 for fermions . the hilbert space of all these states , without the constraint @xmath27 , is known as the fock space .",
    "clearly , the many - body wave function @xmath23 can be expanded in this basis as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amplitude for the gas to be in state @xmath24 at time @xmath30 . in this basis",
    "the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath31 which shows that we need the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between different states in the fock space . to calculate these",
    "most easily we introduce so - called annihilation operators @xmath32 by @xmath33 from which it follows that the creation operators @xmath34 obey @xmath35 as a result , we see that the operator @xmath36 counts the number of atoms in the state @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 we have also that @xmath39_{\\mp } =   [ \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf n},\\alpha } ,                             \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf n}',\\alpha'}]_{\\mp}=0 $ ] and most importantly that @xmath40_{\\mp }    = \\delta_{{\\bf n},{\\bf n } ' } \\delta_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}~.\\ ] ] in equations ( [ cr ] ) and ( [ com ] ) the upper sign refers to bosons and the lower to fermions",
    ". this will be true throughout the course .    from these results",
    "we can now easily show , first of all , that the basis in the fock space is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 the vacuum state containing no atoms .",
    "second , the hamiltonian is @xmath43 with @xmath44 the one - particle energies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 is the amplitude for a collision which scatters two atoms out of the states @xmath46 and @xmath47 into the states @xmath37 and @xmath48 , as schematically shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "introducing the field operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that annihilate and create atoms in the spin state @xmath21 at position @xmath51 respectively , we can rewrite this result into @xmath52 note that , due to the ( anti)commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators and the orthogonality of the wave functions @xmath53 , the field operators obey @xmath54_{\\mp}=   [ \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha}({\\bf x } ) ,               \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha'}({\\bf x}')]_{\\mp}= 0 $ ] and @xmath55_{\\mp}=                       \\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}')\\delta_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}$ ] .",
    "moreover , it is also important for the following to note that the number operator is @xmath56 and , similarly , that the effective total spin operator is @xmath57 the density of atoms in the state @xmath21 is thus simply @xmath58 .",
    "this completes our brief discussion of the second quantization formalism . in principle",
    ", we could now proceed to develop an operator formulation of the quantum field theory of interest to us . since the experimentally most important observables can be expressed as appropriate products of the field operators , as we have just seen",
    ", this would essentially amount to the study of the ( imaginary ) time evolution of the heisenberg operator @xmath59 at a fixed chemical potential @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "put differently , the desired quantum field theory would be defined by the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath61_-~,\\ ] ] and we would need to solve this equation in a sufficiently accurate approximation . as mentioned previously ,",
    "however , we here want to develop feynman s ` path - integral ' formulation of the problem , which will turn out to be much more convenient for our purposes . to do so in a manner that is the same for both bosonic and fermionic atomic gases",
    ", we first need to introduce some mathematical background .",
    "we have seen that in the case of fermions , we need to make use of anticommuting creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this automatically builds in the pauli principle in the theory , because it implies that @xmath62 and thus that the occupation numbers @xmath63 are restricted to be either @xmath64 or @xmath65 . for reasons that will become clear in a moment ,",
    "it is in that case also convenient to introduce anticommuting complex numbers or grassmann variables .",
    "the simplest example is to have two such grassmann variables , say @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the set @xmath68 , and linear combinations thereof with complex coefficients , form then a so - called grassmann algebra",
    ".    by definition we have @xmath69_+ = [ \\phi,\\phi^*]_+ = [ \\phi^*,\\phi^*]_+ = 0 $ ] and thus in particular @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the above set is indeed complete .",
    "the complex conjugation in this algebra is defined by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , we can also define an analytic function on this algebra by @xmath74 as a result , it is natural to define also a differentiation by @xmath75 to be more precise this is in fact a left differentiation and the minus sign occurs , because we need to permute @xmath67 and @xmath66 before we can differentiate with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "so , similarly , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77    next we also need integrations over these grassmann variables . note that since @xmath78 we have only two possible integrals , namely @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we define these by @xmath81 and @xmath82 this means that integration is equivalent to differentation .",
    "the main reason for the above definition is that we want the integration to obey the usual rules of partial integration . in particular",
    ", this implies that @xmath83 for any function @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that this condition requires that @xmath85 .",
    "the result of @xmath86 is then solely a question of normalization .",
    "it turns out that we are primarily interested in integrals of the form @xmath87 as we will see in section [ fi ] .",
    "clearly , we can now also consider the grassmann algebra based on the variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "what we will need in the following are gaussian integrals over these variables .",
    "it is not difficult to show with the above definitions that @xmath91}~.\\ ] ] if the variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 were just ordinary complex numbers we would in contrast have the result @xmath92}~.\\ ] ] these last two results will be used many times in the following .",
    "one immediate use of these grassmann variables is that we can now consider eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath32 , also when we are dealing with fermions .",
    "these eigenstates are called coherent states .",
    "consider the state @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a grassmann variable that also anticommutes with the creation and annihilation operators in our fock space .",
    "clearly we have that @xmath95 so @xmath96 is indeed an eigenstate of @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath94 . in general",
    "we can now make the states @xmath97 that obey @xmath98 .",
    "introducing the grassmann - valued field @xmath99 , the latter two relations can be rewritten as @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it is important to note that these coherent states are not orthonormal .",
    "in contrast , we find that @xmath102 nevertheless they obey a closure relation , as can be seen explicitly from @xmath103 we write this from now on simply as @xmath104d[\\phi]~e^{-(\\phi|\\phi ) } |\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| = \\hat{1}~.\\ ] ]    the interesting observation at this point is that essentially the same formulaes also hold for bosons @xcite .",
    "we have only a minus sign difference in @xmath105 but then it can still be easily shown that @xmath106 .",
    "a convenient way to do so is , for instance , by noting that the commutation relation @xmath107_-                             = \\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf x } ' ) \\delta_{\\alpha,\\alpha'}$ ] implies that @xmath108 acts as @xmath109 on these states .",
    "furthermore , the same expressions hold for the overlap @xmath110 and the closure relation , if we define the integration measure by @xmath111d[\\phi ] \\equiv \\int \\prod_{{\\bf n},\\alpha }                       d\\phi^*_{{\\bf n},\\alpha } d\\phi_{{\\bf n},\\alpha}/(2\\pi i)$ ] in this case .    summarizing ,",
    "we have thus found for bosons and fermions that @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath104d[\\phi]~e^{-(\\phi|\\phi ) } |\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| = \\hat{1}~.\\ ] ] the last ingredient we need is that in terms of these coherent states the trace of an operator @xmath114 over the fock space can be expressed as @xmath115 = \\int d[\\phi^*]d[\\phi]~e^{-(\\phi|\\phi ) }                   \\langle\\pm\\phi|\\hat{o}|\\phi\\rangle~.\\ ] ] the minus sign in the fermionic case is easily understood from the fact that we then have @xmath116 , due to the anticommuting nature of the grassmann variables .",
    "after this mathematical interlude we can now return to physics and to our goal of arriving at a unified treatment of bosonic and fermionic atomic gases .",
    "we are interested in determining the equilibrium properties of a trapped atomic gas at some temperature @xmath117 . from statistical physics we know that all these properties can be obtained from the grand - canonical partition function @xmath118~,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath60 the chemical potential .",
    "we thus need to evaluate this quantity .",
    "as mentioned previously , we want to do so by making use of quantum field theory and , in addition , of feynman s path - integral approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "we thus want to write the partition function as a functional integral over time - dependent fields @xmath120 , just like the partition function of a single particle in an external potential can be written as a functional integral over all time - dependent paths @xmath121 .",
    "this can indeed be achieved with the coherent states that we have introduced in the previous section .",
    "we start with using our formula ( [ trace ] ) for the trace of an operator , @xmath122d[\\phi]~e^{-(\\phi|\\phi ) }              \\langle\\pm\\phi| e^{-\\beta(\\hat{h}-\\mu \\hat{n } ) } |\\phi\\rangle~,\\ ] ] and observe that we are thus faced with the task of calculating the matrix elements @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this is difficult in general but can be simplified in the following way .",
    "we first realize that the operator @xmath126 is identical to the quantum mechanical evolution operator @xmath127 evaluated at @xmath128 .",
    "put differently , we thus want to calculate the matrix elements of the imaginary - time evolution operator @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "to do so , we next split the time interval @xmath131 $ ] into @xmath132 pieces , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "so @xmath135 .",
    "the procedure is summarized in figure 2 .",
    "$ ] needed for feynman s path - integral formulation of the partition function . ]    at each intermediate time @xmath136 we then apply a closure relation of the coherent states .",
    "this gives @xmath137d[\\phi_m]~       e^{-(\\phi_m|\\phi_m ) } \\right ) \\prod_{m=1}^m \\langle\\phi_m|       e^{-\\delta\\tau(\\hat{h}-\\mu \\hat{n})/\\hbar } |\\phi_{m-1}\\rangle~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we can use that in the limit @xmath138 we only need to know the latter matrix elements up to order @xmath139 , because terms of order @xmath140 lead to corrections of order @xmath141 , which vanish in that limit .",

    "note that to actually perform the hartree - fock calculation in the latter case , we need to be able to determine the green s function @xmath313 .",
    "the easiest way to do so , is by realizing that it is the green s function of the operator in the fermionic piece of the action @xmath314 $ ] obtained after the hubbard - stratonovich transformations .",

    "clearly , in the cases that the eigenstates are not affected by these so - called mean - field effects , we recover the weak - coupling results of the previous section .",

    "the latter approach actually gives us also the opportunity to study the density fluctuations and therefore the collective excitations of the gas .",
    "we return to this important topic in section [ modes ] .",
    "second , it allows for a beautiful way to describe phase transitions . as mentioned previously , in perturbation",
    "theory we always find for a homogeneous gas that @xmath322 due to the same feature of @xmath323 . from a fundamental point of view",
    "this is a result of the translational invariance of the gas and of the rotational symmetry in spin space .",
    "however , we can imagine that in principle we can also find selfconsistent solutions that do not have this property .",
    "we then have a spontaneous breaking of symmetry and therefore a phase transition in our system .",
    "for example , if below a certain temperature @xmath324 , we are dealing with a transition to a charge density wave or ( wigner ) crystal . if on the other hand @xmath325 the gas is in a ferromagnetic phase . for a spin - density wave",
    "we even have that @xmath326 . in all these cases",
    "the hubbard - stratonovich approach used above leads in a natural way to the appropriate landau theory of the phase transition .",
    "since the landau theory is also very useful for the understanding of superfluidity in atomic gases , which is clearly the primary goal of the present course , we use the next section to give a short introduction into this subject .      in this summary of the landau theory of phase transitions ,",
    "we restrict ourselves in first instance to the homogeneous case because this makes the discussion more transparent .",
    "however , at the end of the section we also briefly mention how the inhomogeneity enters the theory .",
    "we have seen , for example in the hartree - fock theory discussed above , that the green s function @xmath327 can have a nonzero value of the average spin density @xmath328 , which is usually called the magnetization @xmath329 in this context .",
    "this signals a phase transition to a ferromagnetic phase and the magnetization is called the order parameter of this transition . in the previous section",
    "we have also seen how we can , in principle exactly , obtain an expression for the partition function as a functional integral over the field @xmath330 , i.e. , @xmath331~e^{-s^{\\rm eff}[{\\bf s}]/\\hbar}~.\\ ] ] we just have to integrate out the fields @xmath332 and @xmath333 . for space and time independent values of the magnetization",
    "@xmath5 the action @xmath334 $ ] is @xmath335 , where @xmath336 is the landau free - energy density and @xmath337 is the total volume of system . because of the symmetry of @xmath248 $ ] under rotations of the spin",
    ", this free - energy density must also be rotationally invariant and can therefore only depend on the magnitude of @xmath5 , which we denote by @xmath338 .",
    "if a phase transition occurs the behaviour of @xmath339 can essentially fall only into two categories .    at temperatures very high compared to the critical temperature @xmath340 ,",
    "the system is fully disorded and the free energy @xmath339 must have a single minimum at @xmath341 to make sure that the order parameter @xmath342 is zero .",
    "bringing the temperature closer to @xmath340 , however , the free energy can develop a second local minimum .",
    "as long as the free energy in this second local minimum is higher than the minimum at @xmath341 , the equilibrium value of @xmath342 will still be zero and no phase transition has occured .",
    "lowering the temperature further , the value of the free energy in the second minimum decrease until , precisely at the critical temperature @xmath340 , it is equal to the free energy at @xmath341 . for temperatures below this critical one",
    "the second minimum has actually become the global minimum of the free energy , which implies that @xmath343 and we are in the ordered phase . in this scenario",
    "the order parameter has always a discontinuity at the critical temperature . as a result",
    ", this corresponds to a discontinuous , or first - order , phase transition .",
    "the behaviour of the free energy and the order parameter is illustarted in figure 10 .",
    "this should be compared with the behaviour of the free energy and the order parameter for a continuous , i.e. , second or higher order , phase transition , which is quite different and depicted in figure 11 .",
    "now the landau free energy @xmath339 has always a single minimum , which for temperatures above @xmath340 is at @xmath341 but at temperatures below the critical temperature shifts to a nonzero value of @xmath338 .",
    "in particular , the order parameter thus shows no discontinuity at @xmath340 .        in the case of a second - order phase transition",
    ", we conclude that near the critical temperature @xmath342 is very small . as a result we can then expand the landau free - energy density in powers of @xmath338 .",
    "because the free energy must also be symmetric under @xmath344 , we have @xmath345 with @xmath346 and @xmath347 . thus if @xmath348 we have @xmath349 and @xmath350 . but for @xmath351 , @xmath352 becomes negative and we have @xmath353 note that the free - energy density in this minimum is @xmath354 and has a discontinuity in its second derivative with respect to the temperature . historically , this is the reason why the corresponding phase transition was named to be of second order .",
    "in fact , the landau theory of second order phase transitions is slightly more involved , because it also considers slow spatial fluctuations in @xmath5 . since a uniform rotation of @xmath5 costs no energy , we must have that the free energy is @xmath355 = \\int d{\\bf x}~    \\left ( \\gamma ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$ } { \\bf s}({\\bf x}))^2                  + \\alpha(t ) |{\\bf s}({\\bf x})|^2                  + \\frac{\\beta}{2 } |{\\bf s}({\\bf x})|^4 \\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath356~e^{-\\beta f_l[{\\bf s}]}$ ] .",
    "landau theory now esentially corresponds to minimizing @xmath357 $ ] and taking only quadratic fluctuations into account .",
    "taking also higher order fluctuations into account turns out to be very difficult .",
    "it requires renormalization group methods , which we are not going to treat here and that can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the effects of these fluctuation corrections to landau theory are generally known as critical phenomena .",
    "interestingly , they do not occur in first - order phase transitions .",
    "more importantly for our purposes is , however , that for atomic gases the fluctuations are only important in a small temperature interval around the critical temperature . for many applications",
    "it is , therefore , possible to neglect them .",
    "what usually can not be negected is the effect of the inhomogeneity of the gas . in the context of landau theory that implies that the coefficients @xmath352 , @xmath358 and @xmath359 in equation ( [ lfe ] ) become also",
    "dependend on the spatial position in the trapping potential .",
    "we will see several examples of this feature in the following .",
    "we finally want to consider two important second - order phase transitions , that are purely due to quantum effects and can be conveniently treated with the methods that we have developed sofar .",
    "moreover , they occur very often in nature , for example in metals , in liquid helium and recently of course also in atomic gases of rubidium @xcite , lithium @xcite , sodium @xcite and hydrogen @xcite .",

    "the phase transition of interest is bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the associated order parameter is @xmath362 , since for time independent @xmath363 the above action has presicely the form of a landau theory with a ` free - energy ' of @xmath364 \\\\ & & = \\int d{\\bf x}~       \\left ( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } |\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}\\phi({\\bf x})|^2             + ( v^{\\rm ex}({\\bf",

    "the reason for the failure of the popov theory in this case is that the bogoliubov - de gennes equation in equation ( [ bdgt ] ) describes physically only the motion of the condensate in the presence of a static noncondensed cloud and not the dynamics of the noncondensed cloud itself .",
    "how that can be achieved is discussed lateron in section [ modes ] , when we have obtained a better understanding of the nonequilibrium theory .",

    "it is clear , however , that to apply these theories to an actual experiment we need to know the interaction parameter @xmath434 . in the case of atomic gases",
    "it is indeed possible to perform an _ ab initio _ calculation of this quantity , something which for instance can not be done for liquid helium .",
    "the reason why @xmath434 can be determined for atomic gases , is that under the experimental conditions of interest the densities are always so low that we only need to consider all two - body processes taking place in the gas and we can neglect three - body and higher - body processes .",
    "this implies physically that we only have to calculate and add the quantum mechanical amplitudes for two atoms to scatter of each other an arbitrary number of times .",
    "diagrammatically the procedure can essentially be summarized by the t - matrix equation in figure 14 , because by iteration of this equation we easily see that we are indeed summing all two - body interacion processes .        denoting the total momentum of the two incoming particles by @xmath435 and the sum of the two matsubara frequencies by @xmath436 , the t - matrix equation in figure 14",
    "can , with our knowledge of how to perform the matsubara sum in the right - hand side , easily be shown to be mathematically equivalent to @xmath437 it is immediately solved by @xmath438 note that this is a somewhat formal result , because the momentum sum in the right - hand side has an ultra - violet divergence , which from a field - theoretical point of view requires a renormalization procedure .",
    "the physical reason for the divergence is that we have used the approximate potential @xmath439 instead of the actual interactomic potential @xmath271 .",
    "the argument for using the @xmath440-function approximation was that the thermal de broglie wavelength of the atoms is for the ultra - low temperatures of interest always much larger than the typical range of the interaction .",
    "we now see that this argument is not fully correct , because if we calculate corrections in perturbation theory , we have to deal with momentum sums which are not always restricted to momenta of order @xmath441 and are therefore sensitive to the precise details of the interaction potential .    to cure this disease",
    "we note that if we put in equation ( [ tmatrix ] ) the bose occupation numbers equal to zero , we precisely get the t - matrix or lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite for two atoms interacting with the potential @xmath439 . furthermore",
    ", if the atoms interact with the potential @xmath271 the solution of the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation is known from elementary scattering theory to be equal to @xmath442 for small incoming momenta and energies , where @xmath443 is the @xmath338-wave scattering length .",
    "we thus conclude that we must interpret @xmath444 as being equal to @xmath445 and , therefore , that the desired t - matrix in principle obeys @xmath446    to obtain an accurate theory for a trapped atomic bose gas that includes the effect of all two - body processes , we should now use instead of @xmath434 the above t - matrix in the bogoliubov or popov theories .",
    "of course , in the normal phase the same is true for the hartree - fock theory .",
    "if the temperature is not too close to the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation , it turns out that @xmath447 and we arrive at the conclusion that for an application to realistic atomic gases we must replace everywhere in section [ sf ] the interaction parameter @xmath434 by @xmath442 . for temperatures close to the critical temperature , this is however no longer true and the bose distribution functions have a nonnegligible effect of the t - matrix @xcite . the theory that , by using ` dressed ' one - particle propagators in figure 14 , selfconsistently includes these effects of the medium on the scattering properties of the atoms is known as the many - body t - matrix theory .",

    "the most important question in this respect is of course : how metastable is the condensate ? within the gaussian approximation this question",
    "is easily answered , because then the dynamics of the condensate is equivalent to the dynamics of a particle in an unstable potential , as we have just seen .",

    "more important for our purposes , however , is that sufficiently close to the maximum number of condensate particles @xmath551 the collective decay of the condensate discussed above is always much more probable than the decay due to two and three - body collisions that lead to a spin - flip or the formation of @xmath549li molecules , respectively . as a result",
    "the collapse of the condensate should be observable within the finite lifetime of the gas .",
    "in fact , on the basis of this separation of time scales we expect the condensate to go through a number of growth and collapse cycles @xcite .",

    "quickly remove almost all the atoms from the condensate .",
    "after this has occurred the condensate grows again from the noncondensed part of the gas and a new growth and collapse cycle begins .",

    "the long - time decay of the condensate is due to two and three - body inelastic collisions . ]",
    "a final issue which needs to be addressed at this point is the actual dynamics of the collapse and , in particular , how we must include the effect of the inelastic growth and decay processes on this dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , the inclusion of these effects is rather complicated and we need the results of section [ cf ] to be able to correctly address this problem .",
    "it is , however , of some interest because sackett _ et al .",

    "the average of the annihilation operators @xmath758 thus always vanishes but the average occupation numbers @xmath644 relax to the equilibrium distribution @xmath795 .",

    "the gas therefore never shows a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath424 symmetry , in agreement with the notion that we are essentially dealing with an ideal bose gas in the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the reason of the absense of the spontaneous symmetry breaking can also be understood from our stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation in equation  ( [ stat ] ) , which shows that the probability distribution for @xmath798 is proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath799 in the degenerate regime of interest .",
    "hence , the corresponding landau free energy @xmath800 never shows an instability towards the formation of a nonzero average of @xmath798 due to the fact that @xmath801 can never become less then zero .",

    "we are now in a position to discuss an interacting bose gas , because in an interacting bose gas , the gas is roughly speaking its own thermal reservoir .",
    "the fokker - planck equation therefore turns out to be quite similar to the one presented in equation ( [ fp2 ] ) . to be more precise , however , we should mention that we aim in this section to describe the formation of a condensate in an interacting bose gas under the conditions that have recently been realized in experiments with atomic rubidium , lithium , sodium and hydrogen gases . in these experiments",

    "( [ qbe ] ) and ( [ fpsc ] ) give an accurate discription of the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "unfortunately , the solution of these coupled equations is not possible analytically and we therefore have to refer to future work for a numerical study and a comparison of this theory with experiment .",
    "we here only remark that the semiclassical approximation in this case amounts to the thomas - fermi result for the condensate density @xmath886 such an approximation implicitly assumes , however , that the dominant mechanism for the formation of the condensate is by means of a coherent evolution and not by incoherent collisions .",
    "this might be expected not to be very accurate on the basis of the homogeneous result that the second mechanism only diverges logarithmically with the system size @xcite , whereas the first diverges linearly @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it seems that only a full solution of equations  ( [ qbe ] ) and ( [ fpsc ] ) can settle this important issue .",
    "although we have up to now primarily been focussed on the dynamics of bose - einstein condensation itself , it is interesting that we have in fact , similarly as for temperatures above the critical temperature , also arrived at an accurate discription of the collective modes of a condensed gas at nonzero temperatures .",
    "since these collective modes are receiving much attention at present , we now briefly want to discuss how such a description emerges from our fokker - planck equation .",
    "since most experiments at present are performed in the collisionless limit , we consider only this limit here .",
    "it is in principle possible , however , to derive the hydrodynamic equations of motions as well @xcite .",
    "let us for simplicitly first assume that the temperature of the gas is sufficiently far below the critical temperature that the many - body t matrix is well approximated by the two - body t matrix , but not so low that the hartree - fock approximation is no longer valid .",
    "in this regime we have that @xmath887 and the dynamics of the noncondensed part of the gas is again determined by the collisionless quantum boltzmann equation given in equation  ( [ clqbe ] ) , where the total density now consists of two contributions @xmath888 the dynamics of the condensate follows again from the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath889 which can be rewritten as the continuity equation @xmath890 together with the josephson relation for the superfluid velocity @xmath891 here , we used that @xmath892 , @xmath893 , and have applied the thomas - fermi approximation , which is appropriate in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "it will presumably not come as a surprise that these coupled equations for @xmath865 , @xmath894 , and @xmath895 can be shown to fulfill the kohn theorem exactly .",
    "this is an important constraint on any theory for the collective modes of a trapped gas , as stressed recently by zaremba , griffin , and nikuni @xcite .    as a first step towards this goal",
    "we here consider the time - dependent hartree - fock theory for the collective modes of the bose condensed gas , in which the collisionless boltzmann equation in equation  ( [ clqbe ] ) is coupled to the nonlinear schrdinger equation in equation  ( [ nlse ] ) .",
    "it turns out that a numerical determination of the eigenmodes of the collisionless boltzmann equation is rather difficult .",
    "therefore , we have recently proposed a variational approach to solve these coupled equations @xcite . denoting the anisotropic harmonic trapping potential used in the experiments @xcite by @xmath896 , we first of all take for the condensate wave function the gaussian _ ansatz _ @xmath897 with the functions @xmath898 describing the ` breathing ' of the condensate in three independent directions . clearly , this is the anisotropic generalization of the gaussian _ ansatz _ that we used in section [ nsl ] to study the stability of a condensate with negative scattering length .",
    "although it is not immediately obvious that such an _ ansatz _ is also appropriate in the strong - coupling regime of interest here , it has been shown by perez - garcia _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that at zero temperature the assumption of a gaussian density profile nevertheless leads to rather accurate results for the frequencies of the collective modes .",
    "we therefore anticipate that at nonzero temperatures the same will be the case .",
    "next we also need an _ ansatz _ for the distribution function @xmath865 of the thermal cloud . here",
    ", we consider the bose distribution @xmath899 where @xmath900 are again three scaling parameters , @xmath901 is the number of noncondensed particles , @xmath902 denotes the equilibrium value of @xmath900 that in general is greater than @xmath65 due to the repulsive interactions between the atoms , and @xmath903 . the functional form of the distribution function is physically motivated by the following reasons .",
    "first , by integrating over the momentum @xmath664 we see that the time - dependent density profile of the noncondensed cloud @xmath904 is a time - independent function of @xmath905 , as desired .",
    "second , for such a density profile we must have that the local velocity @xmath906 is given by @xmath907 .",
    "third , we want the equilibrium distribution to be only anisotropic in coordinate space , and not in momentum space .",
    "this explains the appearance of the factor @xmath908 in the exponent .",
    "the full lines give the results with a bose distribution _",
    "ansatz _ for the distribution function of the thermal cloud .",
    "curves 1 and 2 correspond to the @xmath909 in and out - of - phase modes , respectively .",
    "similarly , curves 3 and 4 give the frequencies of the @xmath910 in and out - of - phase modes .",
    "the experimental data is also shown .",
    "triangles are for a @xmath909 mode and circles for a @xmath910 mode . ]    using the ideal gas result for the number of condensate particles and substituting the above _ ansatz _ for the condensate wave function and the wigner distribution function into the nonlinear schrdinger and collisionless boltzmann equations , it is straightforward but somewhat tedious to derive the six coupled equations of motion for the ` breathing ' parameters @xmath898 and @xmath900 .",
    "linearizing these equations around the equilibrium solutions @xmath911 and @xmath902 , respectively , we can then also obtain the desired eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies . the results of this calculation for the trap parameters of jin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are shown in figure 18 together with the experimental data .",
    "note that the trap has a disk geometry with @xmath912 and @xmath913 . due to the axial symmetry",
    ", the modes of the gas can be labeled by the usual quantum number @xmath4 that describes the angular dependence around the @xmath914-axis . on the whole",
    "there appears to be a quite reasonable agreement between this simple theory and experiment .",
    "the only exceptions are the two data point almost halfway in between the in and out - of - phase @xmath909 modes .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that experimentally both modes are excited simultaneously @xcite . to make sure of this ,",
    "however , we need to determine the oscillator strength of the various modes and it appears that the in - phase mode indeed dominates the response for temperatures larger than about @xmath915 @xcite .",
    "with the latter remark we end this course on the use of field - theoretical methods for the study of the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of trapped atomic gases .",
    "although we have in principle illustrated all the necessary tools for an _ ab initio _ treatment of these new quantum systems , many interesting topics still need to be considered in detail .",
    "we already mentioned such topics as fermi - bose mixtures , the dynamics of condensate collapse , the strong - coupling theory for the formation of a condensate in either atomic bose of fermi gases , and the hydrodynamics of single or multicomponent atomic gases .",
    "several other important areas of research , which can also be easily addressed within the context of quantum field theory , are atom lasers , the damping of collective modes , the behaviour of spinor condensates , the dynamics of topological excitations such as kinks , vortices and skyrmions , quantum critical phenomena , the optical properties of superfluid gases , and two - dimensional phase transitions . in view of these and many other possibilities that are now experimentally feasible",
    ", it appears certain that the physics of degenerate atomic gases will remain very exciting for years to come .",

    "<S> in this course we give a selfcontained introduction to the quantum field theory for trapped atomic gases , using functional methods throughout . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena . in the equilibrium case </S>",
    "<S> , we first derive the appropriate hartree - fock theory for the properties of the gas in the normal phase . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn our attention to the properties of the gas in the superfluid phase , and present a microscopic derivation of the bogoliubov and popov theories of bose - einstein condensation and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the former are applicable to trapped bosonic gases such as rubidium , lithium , sodium and hydrogen , and the latter in particular to the fermionic isotope of atomic lithium . in the nonequilibrium case , we discuss various topics for which a field - theoretical approach is especially suited , because they involve physics that is not contained in the gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> examples are quantum kinetic theory , the growth and collapse of a bose condensate , the phase dynamics of bosonic and fermionic superfluids , and the collisionless collective modes of a bose gas below the critical temperature . </S>"
