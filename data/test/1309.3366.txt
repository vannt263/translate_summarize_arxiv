    ". this asymmetry may affect the macroscopic properties at the critical point @xcite , although the knowledge about it is still at a preliminary level @xcite .",

    "in particular , studies on how a generic curvature - composition nonlinearity , allowed by specific symmetry considerations , can affect the resulting phase behavior of the model , should be of interest .    in this article",
    "we ask whether asymmetry in an inhomogeneous fluid membrane can significantly enhance fluctuations near phase transitions . since any purported effects of asymmetry are likely to depend on how asymmetry affects the system free energy , we theoretically propose and study a model belonging to a particular symmetry for phase transitions in both symmetric and asymmetric inhomogeneous membranes .",
    "our model is a reduced model , in which the bilayer nature is not kept explicitly ; instead it is replaced effectively by an inhomogeneous single layer for simplicity .",
    "our main results are that depending upon the bending modulus @xmath2 the composition field that describes the inhomogeneity of the asymmetric membrane in our model may display ( i ) both first and second order phase transition through a critical point ( cp ) and",

    "we provide a mean - field ( mf ) analysis of the phase diagram of the model and calculate the universal scaling exponents that characterize the cp and tp in our model by using perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) methods . unlike more commonly used linear curvature - composition coupling @xcite , our model involves non - linear curvature - composition coupling belonging to a particular symmetry ( see below )",

    "a real asymmetric lipid bilayer generally consists of two lipid monolayers , which are constitutionally different ( i.e. , non - identical ) , e.g. , cell membranes of eukaryotic cells  @xcite .",
    "there are microscopic processes ( e.g. , flip - flop  @xcite ) which lead to exchange of the constituent molecules between the two monolayers of a bilayer",
    ". however , these exchange processes are typically very slow .",
    "in addition , there are biochemical processes which may favor maintaining compositional differences across the leaflets  @xcite .",
    "thus , the compositions of the two leaflets over relevant physical and biological time scales may be very different .",
    "coarse - grained models for an asymmetric lipid bilayer thus require two sets of scalar fields , one each for each of the monolayers , representing the compositional degree of freedom in the corresponding monolayer , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we , however , use a simpler approach , where a single field @xmath4 is used together with a height field to mathematically describe an asymmetric membrane . here ,",
    "the asymmetry is no longer described by the composition differences between the two monolayers , but rather by the breakdown of the inversion symmetry of the membrane .",
    "thus , effectively , only a single layer is considered instead of a bilayer structure .",
    "there is already a substantial body of work that uses a single composition field degree of freedom , together with a height field , to model an asymmetric inhomogeneous membrane ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "our model is in the same spirit as them .",
    "here are the details of our model : we use a coarse - grained description to build our model . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore the bilayer structure , and model it implicitly by a single inhomogeneous fluid membrane , microscopically made up of two components ( say , two types of lipids ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with local concentrations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with vanishing surface tension @xcite , described by a height field @xmath9 in the monge gauge @xcite and the concentration difference field @xmath10 $ ] , as the relevant compositional degree of freedom , since we are interested in phase transitions in the membrane @xcite , and @xmath11 . the detailed form of the free energy functional depends sensitively on the underlying symmetry of the model system .",
    "we choose @xmath4 to have the _ ising - symmetry _ , interacting via local ferromagnetic ising - like interactions  @xcite .",
    "further , the system being asymmetric is _ not _ invariant under the inversion symmetry @xmath12 .",
    "our imposition of these symmetries for an asymmetric membrane , dictates that the system and hence the corresponding free energy functional @xmath13 should be invariant under @xmath14 ( hereafter symi ) .",

    "our choice of curvature - composition coupling is made for the purpose of illustration  @xcite and complementary to that in refs .",

    "the @xmath27-term violates the inversion symmetry @xmath12 ; where as for a symmetric membrane one has @xmath41 , leading to invariance under symii .",
    "lastly , since our model effectively assumes the bilayer to be a single incompressible sheet , it is unable to capture the effects of coupling of the local bending and densities of the two monolayers @xcite , which yields a new slow mode related to fluctuations in the density difference in the two monolayers .",
    "notice that in constructing our model we have been guided solely by general symmetry considerations , without any reference to microscopic or molecular level details .",
    "we believe it is useful to theoretically construct models with specific symmetry using this approach and study the ensuing macroscopic consequences , in view of the relative lack of quantitative results on the universal scaling properties of phase transitions in asymmetric membranes , in comparison with their symmetric counterparts .",
    "it is instructive to begin with a mf analysis for the phase transitions in the model , ignoring the @xmath37-term ( it is subdominant to the existing terms ; see below ) .",

    ", the effective landau free energy ( [ effre ] ) may be analysed in a standard way  @xcite : one finds the following possibilities : ( i ) a cp at @xmath61 with @xmath62 , ( ii ) a first order phase transition at @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and ( iii ) a tp at @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 as schematically shown in fig .

    "we now critical exponents @xmath68 and @xmath69 through the relations @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 at both cp and tp .",
    "the presence of the first order transition in this model clearly underlines the requirement of a @xmath73 term in @xmath13 for thermodynamic stability .",

    "we shall see below that @xmath78 becomes scale - dependent , i.e. , it depends on the local scale @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 is positive definite , @xmath81 generally , opening up the possibility of @xmath78 being zero or negative .",
    "since @xmath78 is generically smaller than @xmath2 , the asymmetric membrane will be generically softer or more flexible than a pure fluid membrane , a feature that should also be displayed by models belonging to symiii  @xcite , which use bilinear curvature - composition coupling .",
    "one may further define a persistence length @xmath82 , such that @xmath83 . noticing that for a system with linear size @xmath3 , the correction to @xmath78 scales as @xmath84 in 2d at the mf @xmath19 given by @xmath61 , we find @xmath85^{1/2}$ ] , thus @xmath86 for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",

    "however , for quantitative predictions on @xmath82 , one requires to have a numerical estimate of @xmath27 , which at present is lacking .",
    "construction of atomistic models and numerical studies on them linking microscopic structures with macroscopic properties or parameters ( e.g. , @xmath88 ) would be useful  @xcite , which are beyond the scope of this work . for @xmath89 , our model shows instabilities akin to refs .",
    "notice however that the instabilities here for @xmath89 are due to a nonlinear curvature - composition coupling , unlike for models in refs .",
    "@xcite , where bilinear curvature - composition couplings are responsible for the instabilities . in the remaining part of the article below",
    ", we only consider @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , considering that @xmath78 has got a @xmath91 ( perturbative ) correction to its bare value @xmath2 coming from the curvature - composition interaction , thence at 2d , with @xmath92 as the local normal to the membrane ( to the leading order in smallness ) , the variance of @xmath93 has a ( perturbatively obtained , ignoring logarithms ) contribution @xmath94 in addition to the contribution from ( bare ) @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 formally diverges as @xmath96 .",
    "this is significantly stronger than the well - known @xmath97 dependence of @xmath98 that ensues for a pure symmetric fluid membranes  @xcite .",
    "even for an inhomogeneous symmetric membrane , @xmath99 must have a weaker @xmath3-dependence than @xmath84 , since the dominant nonlinearity responsible for the @xmath84-behavior ( i.e. , the @xmath27-term ) in our model is always absent for a symmetric membrane .",
    "this is thus a feature of an asymmetric membrane described by our model that may be directly testable in experiments and can be contrasted with the same from symmetric membranes .",

    "it can be shown in that ( a ) @xmath102 does not contribute to the fluctuation corrections of @xmath4 ; with @xmath40 remaining as the most relevant nonlinearity , large - scale properties of @xmath4 is identical to that of the ising model , and ( b ) due to the absence of any nonlinear term there are no non - trivial fluctuation corrections to @xmath2 from @xmath102 , and hence , as long as @xmath103 , @xmath104 is identical to that of a pure fluid membrane .",
    "in contrast , our model for asymmetric membranes displays generic non - ising behavior of @xmath4 including a first order transition and scale - dependent diverging fluctuations of @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , as already pointed out above , for a symmetric membrane with symii at 2d , @xmath105  @xcite , much weaker than its @xmath84-dependence for an asymmetric membrane in our model  @xcite .",
    "we confirm below the existence of cp and tp , extract the corresponding universal scaling exponents and show the divergence of the variance of asymmetric membrane fluctuations in a perturbative rg calculation  @xcite .",
    "for a symmetric membrane ( @xmath41 ) the remaining geometric non - linearities are irrelevant at 2d in the presence of the @xmath40-term with upper critical dimension @xmath106 , and hence are ignored .",
    "effectively , thus in our model there are no _ relevant _ coupling between @xmath4 and @xmath104 in a symmetric membrane .",
    "consequently the critical behavior of @xmath4 is identical to the ising model , thus belonging to the 2d ising universality class , already studied extensively in a rg framework @xcite : one obtains @xmath107 with @xmath108 ( the @xmath109 interaction is irrelevant in a rg sense ) .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental results on lipid bilayers by several groups  @xcite .",
    "further , fluctuation statistics of @xmath104 is identical to that of a pure fluid membrane .",
    "assuming a nearly flat conformation ( see discussions in the concluding section ) , predictions from our model is more complicated for an asymmetric membrane for which @xmath110 with @xmath106 , along with @xmath40 are relevant couplings ( in a rg sense ) .",
    "thus the ensuing universal scaling behavior at the physically relevant dimension @xmath111 is expected to be different from both the mean - field scaling behavior for an asymmetric membrane discussed before and 2d ising behavior of a symmetric membrane . in order to analyze this , we perform a systematic rg analysis of the model following standard procedure well - documented in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the renormalization @xmath112-factors for the different vertex functions , which are introduced to absorb ultra - violet ( uv ) divergences in the theory , are calculated by using a dimensional regularization together with a minimal subtraction scheme in terms of an arbitrary momentum scale @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "the vertex functions in the present model , which have primitive divergences and hence require renormalization , are given by ( the right hand sides of the expressions below are the bare values of the vertex functions in our model that can be easily read off from the free energy functional ( [ free ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath114 where @xmath115 is the vertex generating functional and is the legendre transform of the free energy corresponding to the partition function ( [ part ] ) ; @xmath116 are fourier wavevectors .",
    "the resulting rg flow equation yields non - trivial scaling of the correlation functions and thermodynamic quantities at the rg fixed points ( fp ) .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in the appendix below .",
    "for calculational convenience we define an implicitly scale - dependent bare coupling constant @xmath117 by @xmath118 , such that the inhomogeneous part of the fluctuation corrections to @xmath40 is absorbed and define renormalized coupling @xmath119 .",
    "we similarly define renormalized @xmath120 . defining the rg @xmath121-function by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , we find _ u & = & u_r[-+ 72u_r - 48_r^2 ] , [ betau ] + _ & = & _ r[-2 + 24u_r - 6_r^2 + 192_r^4 ] .",
    "[ betalambda ] the fps are determined by the zeros of the @xmath121-functions above : ( i ) gaussian ( or trivial ) fixed point given by @xmath124 , ( ii ) ising fp given by @xmath125 , ( iii ) tricritical fp given by @xmath126 and ( iv ) nontrivial fixed point ( nfp ) given by @xmath127 .",
    "very small value of @xmath128 at nfp suggests larger @xmath82 and hence easier experimental accessibility at nfp .",
    "each of these fps represents a different universality class , characterized by a different set of values of the critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "for example , we find for    * gaussian fp : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , * ising fp : identical to the symmetric membrane case , * tp : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and * nfp : @xmath133 .    thus , @xmath134 at all the fps , in agreement with our qualitative discussions above on @xmath81 . from the scaling exponents calculated above",

    "disregarding the geometric nonlinearities ( which are irrelevant in a rg sense in the presence of @xmath40 and @xmath27 ) , for a symmetric membrane variance @xmath148 varies as @xmath97  @xcite .",
