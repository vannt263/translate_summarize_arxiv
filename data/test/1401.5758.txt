    "the radiation emitted by physical processes ongoing in active galaxies sculpt a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that spreads on a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "multi - wavelength photometry is thus a rich source of information about the agn nature .",
    "one method to extract this information is through sed fitting , which consist in comparing the observed photometric data to a combination of physical models for agn components .",
    "it is customary to perform sed fitting using optimization methods as @xmath0-minimization , which defines the best fit as the combination of parameters which models the whole sed showing the minimal @xmath0 value .",
    "however , this method is statistically correct only under the assumption that the parameters are fully independent from each other and thus have a gaussian probability distribution .",
    "this assumption is a drawback of this method since the parameters describing agn physics are in most cases highly degenerated . to solve this issue we present agn__fitter _ _ , a bayesian sed fitting code for agn that allows an integral calculation of the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters taking into account degeneracies and correlations existing among them .",
    "agn__fitter _ _ samples the parameter space built by the agn models parameters using a markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "this consists in a random walk that is biased for regions of higher probability in the parameter space , making the code fast and efficient since no time is lost in non - interesting regions .",

[ 0.96 ]        the dimension of the parameter space sampled by agn__fitter _ _ is constructed in this first version by 10 parameters , which rule the modeling of four agn components : the accretion disk radiation , the nuclear hot dust emission and the radiation emitted by the host galaxy and the star burst regions . for the accretion disk radiation ( big blue bump )",

    "moreover , agn__fitter _ _ provides both the marginalized and two - dimensional posterior density functions ( pdf ) of the parameters listed above . in this way",
