    "with advancing quantum technologies  @xcite it is becoming increasingly important to understand interaction of quantum systems with external degrees of freedom .",
    "evolution of a system coupled to environment can be described by a master equation .",
    "a particularly appealing type of a master equation is a lindblad equation  a rather general setting that can describe any markovian evolution  @xcite . while lindblad equations have been used extensively in the past to describe few - particle systems in nmr or quantum optics , recently increasing efforts are devoted to understand many - body systems in the lindblad setting .",
    "motivation comes from a wide range of fields where lindblad equations find their application , to name a few : as a computational resource in quantum information , to study e.g. transport properties of strongly - correlated condensed - matter systems , or to study nonequilibrium statistical physics of many - body systems .",
    "usually the object of most interest for open systems is a steady state , that is , a state to which any initial state converges after a long time .",
    "besides the steady state , dynamics is also of interest with one of the most important quantities being the relaxation time . in a finite system relaxation time",
    "is simply equal to the inverse gap of the liouvillian propagator generating evolution . in statistical physics",
    "the scaling power of the gap is called the dynamical exponent  a critical exponent determining a universality class to which a model belongs .",
    "dynamical exponents have been extensively studied in classical exclusion models , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite or refs .",
    "@xcite for some more recent results .    in a quantum domain",
    "much less is known about relaxation times of many - body systems .",
    "depending on a situation one might want the gap to be large or small .",
    "for instance , if dissipation is engineered in order to prepare a specific steady state one might want relaxation to be as fast as possible . on the other hand , if dissipation is unwanted , for instance , in a quantum memory device , relaxation should be as slow as possible .",
    "the value of the gap @xmath2 is important not just for the relaxation time itself  @xcite , but can also carry information about the steady - state properties .",
    "namely , if the gap is finite ( so - called rapidly mixing systems ) one can show that this implies a clustering of correlations in the steady state  @xcite , meaning that local observables are uncorrelated on a scale larger than @xmath3 .",
    "rapid mixing also implies the stability of steady state to local perturbations  @xcite .",
    "if the gap on the other hand closes in the thermodynamic limit this can lead to a nonequilibrium phase transition  @xcite and can result in a non - exponential relaxation  @xcite towards a steady state .",
    "understanding how the gap scales with the system size is therefore of fundamental importance .",
    "there have been few scattered results in the literature calculating or bounding the gap either analytically or numerically for specific lindblad models . with our work",
    "we plan to extend these results , studying in more detail how the gap scales with the system size .",
    "one can distinguish grossly two different situations depending on the number of sites at which dissipation acts : in a lattice with @xmath4 sites dissipation acts on @xmath5 sites ( i.e. , on most sites ) , a setting we will call bulk dissipation , or , it can act only on a fixed number of sites ( number of sites does not grow with @xmath4 ) , a setting we will call boundary dissipation ( eventhough sites at which it acts need not be at a boundary ) . not surprisingly , as we shall see the gap can behave differently in the two cases .",
    "what is known so far is that for so - called davies generators , also called thermal reservoirs , that are an example of bulk dissipation , one is in certain cases able to rigorously prove that the gap is independent of the system length  @xcite , @xmath6 .",
    "one can also show exponential relaxation in weakly coupled systems  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can show that the gap can be constant for some other systems with bulk dissipation  @xcite , while in other systems it can also scale as @xmath7  @xcite . on the other hand , for open systems with boundary dissipation the observed gaps have so - far all been scaling as @xmath1 , or smaller , examples being the xy  @xcite or the xxx  @xcite model .",
    "for scaling of gaps in the redfield equation see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work we are going to study the scaling of the gap with system size in a number of spin chain models with bulk as well as with boundary dissipation .",
    "the aim is to get a better overview of possible gap scaling and changes in the scaling power as one varies parameters .",
    "such changes can be associated with possible phase transitions in the steady state as well as in decay modes . in the main part of the paper",
    "we shall organize sections according to different models studied , explaining for each different techniques used ( ranging from analytical to numerical ) to infer the scaling .",
    "we shall also pay attention to the validity of a weak - dissipation perturbation theory that can be used to calculate the gap , demonstrating its failure in a number of cases .",
    "if one is not interested in all the details of gap calculation , or just wants an overview of different gap scalings found , there are tables  [ tab : bulk ] and  [ tab : bound ] provided in the summary section at the end of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii .",
    "we briefly explain the setting of lindblad equations . in sec iii .",
    "we then study systems with bulk dissipation , while in sec .",
    "we study systems with boundary dissipation .",
    "each of these two sections is split into subsections describing different systems . in sec.iv .",
    "we also explain an argument that the gap in systems with boundary dissipation can not be larger than @xmath0 . finally , in sec.v .",
    "we conclude as well as present a summary of the results found .",

    "the models that we are going to study will all be spin chains composed of @xmath4 lattice sites , each carrying a spin-@xmath15 particle .",
    "coupling in @xmath16 will always be local between nearest - neighbor sites only , and with open boundary conditions .",
    "dissipation will also be local , i.e. , each lindblad operator @xmath10 will act nontrivially only on a single site ( different @xmath10 though can act on different sites ) .",
    "two types of dissipation will be employed , both physically motivated .",
    "the first one is dephasing for which @xmath17 , and which tries to destroy off - diagonal matrix elements ( in the eigenbasis of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the second one is magnetization driving in which lindblad operators proportional to raising and lowering operators try to impose an imbalance in populations of spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "we mention that the many - body spin chain models studied here are within reach of present day cold - atom technology , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , with individual components like few qubit controlled dissipation  @xcite or heisenberg spin chains  @xcite already demonstrated .",
    "a canonical model that we shall study in both bulk- and boundary - driven cases is the anisotropic heisenberg model ( xxz model for short ) . for zero anisotropy",
    "the xxz model goes into the xx model , which is especially simple and even allows for an exact asymptotic solution .",
    "the hamiltonian of the xx model is @xmath19 dissipation @xmath20 is given by dephasing of strength @xmath21 acting independently on each site , which is described by a set of @xmath4 lindblad operators , @xmath22    we note that such liouvillian @xmath11 conserves the total magnetization @xmath23 , that is , if @xmath24 is an eigenstate of @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath26 and similarly @xmath27 is an eigenstate of @xmath25 with an eigenvalue @xmath28 , then @xmath29 is a superposition of terms in which all @xmath30 and all @xmath31 are again eigenstates of @xmath25 with eigenvalues @xmath26 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "more formally conservation means that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being rotation around the @xmath34-axis .",
    "@xmath11 therefore has a block structure and we shall label each block by a magnetization difference @xmath34 and by a number of flipped spins @xmath35 , @xmath36 for an @xmath4-site chain the allowed values of @xmath34 are from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in steps of @xmath39 , while that of @xmath35 are @xmath40 .",
    "of special interest will be sectors with @xmath41 because they carry a steady state , i.e. , an eigenstate of @xmath11 with eigenvalue @xmath42 .",
    "a subspace with @xmath41 and some value of @xmath35 will be simply called an @xmath35-particle sector and has ( operator ) dimension @xmath43 .",
    "two most important ones are @xmath44 ( 1-particle sector ) , being the smallest nontrivial one , and the largest one with @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 for odd @xmath4 ) being called a half - filling sector because half of the spins are pointing up and half are pointing down .",
    "an important property of dissipative systems where @xmath16 is quadratic in fermionic operators ( via jordan - wigner transformation ) and lindblad operators are hermitian ( but not necessarily quadratic ) , and our xx model is an example of such a system , is that equations for correlation functions split into a hierarchy of equations according to their order , i.e. , the number of fermionic operators in the expectation value  @xcite .",
    "this enables one to exactly calculate few - point expectation values in the steady state , for instance in the presence of an additional boundary driving  @xcite , an incoherent bulk hopping  @xcite , or special engineered dissipation  @xcite .",
    "here we are not interested in the steady state but instead in the liouvillian gap , in particular in its scaling with the system size @xmath4 . due to magnetization conservation",
    "there are @xmath47 steady states , one in each invariant subspace with @xmath41 and a particular @xmath35 .",
    "one can also easily see that such a steady state is a uniform mixture off projectors to all @xmath48 diagonal basis states in the corresponding @xmath35-particle subspace , for instance , for @xmath49 in a 1-particle sector ( @xmath44 , @xmath41 ; subspace dimension @xmath50 ) the steady state is @xmath51 . for more details about such states , for instance their schmidt spectrum , see appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "subspaces with @xmath52 do not contain any zero eigenvalues ( i.e. , steady states ) because they are orthogonal to the identity operator which is , due to trace preservation , always a left eigenvector of @xmath11 with eigenvalue zero and is therefore non - orthogonal to all steady states . because we are interested in the gap we can limit our discussion to subspaces with @xmath41 as they are the only ones that contain steady states .",
    "subspaces with @xmath53 and @xmath54 are of dimension @xmath55 and contain only the steady state and are of no interest to us .",
    "all other @xmath56 subspaces contain a nontrivial gap .",
    "we shall be in particular interested in the smallest gap out of those , i.e. , the global one , giving the slowest relaxation rate in the system .",
    "because of a hierarchy of correlations we know that the eigenvalues , i.e. decay rates , of @xmath57-point correlation equations are equal to ( some ) eigenvalues of the liouvillian  @xcite , however , one in general does not know whether they also give the gap . regardless of",
    "that they can be used as an upper bound on the global gap .",
    "for instance , for a model with an incoherent hopping the relaxation rate of @xmath39-point correlations scales as @xmath7  @xcite meaning that the global gap can not be larger . similarly ,",
    "for a boundary - driven system numerical calculation of the global gap also resulted in @xmath7 scaling  @xcite .    by numerically diagonalizing our @xmath11 in each @xmath35-particle sector",
    "we observe that the gap is in fact the same in all sectors .",
    "this in particular means that to calculate the global gap it is enough to consider the @xmath55-particle sector which is of dimension @xmath58 ( or its symmetric @xmath59-particle partner that has exactly the same eigenvalues ) .",
    "this is due to a free nature of @xmath16 , causing that the spectrum of the 1-particle sector to be contained in higher-@xmath35 sectors .",
    "one could be tempted to conclude that the @xmath55-particle sector will be rather trivial ",
    "this is certainly true for a @xmath55-particle sector of dimension @xmath4 in the hilbert space of states  however , here we are dealing with a @xmath55-particle sector of dimension @xmath60 in the hilbert space of operators . as we shall see this allows for a rich behavior , among other things for a discontinuous transition in the scaling of the gap from a constant @xmath61 for small dephasing strength @xmath21 to @xmath7 for non - small @xmath21 .    before going to the actual calculation of the gap",
    "let us pause for a moment and have a look at an alternative formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the whole @xmath11 .",
    "the liouvillian that acts on a @xmath62 dimensional operator space is a non - hermitian linear operator that can be written as a `` hamiltonian '' of a non - hermitian spin-@xmath15 ladder composed of @xmath4 rungs .",
    "each rung , spanned by @xmath63 pure states , takes care of one site of @xmath11 which is also @xmath63 dimensional ( e.g. , three pauli matrices plus an identity ) .",
    "the resulting ladder is for the xx chain with dephasing very simple : it is composed of two @xmath64-coupled chains along the ladder legs with an additional imaginary coupling along rungs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lestev ] and appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for the mapping details .",
    "interaction along upper and lower legs ( thin lines ) and an imaginary @xmath65 interaction due to dephasing along rungs ( double lines).,width=316 ]    the steady state is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue zero , in other words a `` ground state '' of a non - hermitian ladder . because of dissipative coupling along rungs this ground state is always , regardless of the value of @xmath21 , a direct product of singlet states at each rung .",
    "the steady state is therefore always dominated by dephasing @xmath21 , forcing the steady state to be a singlet state .",
    "this is due to a very special structure of @xmath11  no interaction in @xmath16 ( which plays an inert role ) and a dephasing that kills all off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "as we shall show , things are very different for the first decay mode determining the gap .",
    "there is a transition from a @xmath21-dominated phase to a different phase in which @xmath16 becomes important .    in the ladder formulation of",
    "@xmath11 we can also see why the @xmath55-particle superoperator sector is nontrivial : it corresponds ( in an appropriate basis ) to states with one particle in the upper leg ( bra ) and one particle in the lower leg ( ket ) .",
    "therefore , a @xmath55-particle superoperator problem is like a problem of @xmath39 interacting particles on a ladder .",
    "it constitutes the simplest case of an interacting system .",
    "let us now calculate the gap in the 1-particle sector .",
    "essentially the same eigenvalue problem , apart from different boundary conditions  @xcite , has been rigorously solved in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall present a different and approximate calculation of the gap , which is simpler but nevertheless accurate in the thermodynamic limit @xmath66 in which we are especially interested .     of the xx model with dephasing @xmath67 .",
    "shown is the exact gap ( symbols ) , the full curve is the approximate formula ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) , while the dotted curve shows the asymptotic expression @xmath68 . the approximate result ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) is accurate for @xmath4 larger than the transition point @xmath69.,width=316 ]    the basic idea is the following .",
    "we have seen that the steady state is always dominated by the dephasing and one can expect that in some range of dephasing strengths the first decay mode will also be of the same nature  that is dominated by @xmath21 .",
    "if this is the case , then its eigenoperator will be close to diagonal because dephasing kills all off - diagonal elements . in the lowest approximation the unitary part @xmath70 couples diagonal elements @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes a state of @xmath4 spins with the @xmath73-th spin being flipped to @xmath74 while all others are in state @xmath75 , to two off - diagonal @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "such a tri - diagonal approximation reduces the size of @xmath11 in the 1-particle sector from @xmath60 to @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , we can immediately see that on this three - diagonal subspace all @xmath59 states of the form @xmath79 are eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath80 ( they are eigenstates of @xmath81 with eigenvalue @xmath42 because of different signs when @xmath16 acts from the left and from the right , while @xmath82 and similarly for @xmath83 ) . reduction of @xmath11 to @xmath84 dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath71 and @xmath85 has a block structure of form , @xmath86 basis ordering is such that the first diagonal block corresponds to @xmath4 states @xmath71 , and the second to @xmath59 states @xmath85 .",
    "writing the eigenvector as @xmath87 and the eigenvalues as @xmath88 , and eliminating @xmath89 , we get an eigenvalue equation @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being a tridiagonal matrix of size @xmath92 with matrix elements @xmath93 @xmath94 is nothing but a standard matrix appearing is a solution of harmonic oscillators or a tight - binding model , and has eigenvalues @xmath95 , leading to eigenvalues @xmath96 of @xmath97 being @xmath98 .",
    "the gap is determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath99 , and is @xmath100 the gap @xmath2 gives the distance of the largest decay mode eigenvalue from the origin along a real axis , with the next largest decay mode being asymptotically at a distance @xmath101 . for @xmath16 with periodic boundary conditions",
    "the gap is @xmath63 times larger than the above @xmath2 ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) .",
    "we can see that for sufficiently small @xmath21 the expression under the square root in eq.([eq : gap1mag ] ) can become negative . for large @xmath4",
    "this happens for @xmath102 , where the critical dephasing is @xmath103     on dephasing and @xmath4 .",
    "full black line is the critical @xmath104 ( [ eq : gammac ] ) delimiting two phases . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) are shown expansion coefficients @xmath105 of the largest decay mode @xmath106 , @xmath107 , showing an almost diagonal dephasing - dominated phase with @xmath108 in ( b ) , and a delocalized phase with @xmath109 in ( c).,width=316 ]    our approximate expression for the gap ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) is accurate only for @xmath110 , where the decay mode is indeed governed by dephasing , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gap1mag ] .",
    "note though that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath111 and therefore eq .  ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) becomes exact for any @xmath21 .",
    "one can see already in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap1mag ] that below @xmath104 ( or @xmath112 , depending on which parameter is held fixed ) the gap becomes independent of @xmath4 and in the thermodynamic limit equal to @xmath113 ( in this regime the largest decay mode eigenvalue is complex and the gap @xmath2 is equal to its real part ) .",
    "therefore , for the largest decay mode there are two phases : for @xmath114 the decay mode is governed by @xmath16 with the gap being @xmath115 , while for @xmath110 the decay mode is governed by dephasing and the gap is @xmath116 .",
    "one can use perturbation theory to show that the gap is indeed independent of system size for sufficiently small dephasing  @xcite .",
    "the convergence radius of weak - coupling perturbation series for small @xmath21 is @xmath104 ( [ eq : gammac ] ) and algebraically shrinks to zero in the thermodynamic limit . also , the thermodynamic limit @xmath66 and the weak coupling limit @xmath117 do no commute , which can be also seen in fig .",

    "subspace the following picture emerges , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eig1mag ] .",
    "most of the eigenvalues , @xmath121 in number , are within the bulk laying in a complex plane .",
    "as one increases @xmath4 eigenvalues `` evaporate '' from the bulk and join a bunch of real eigenvalues to the right of the bulk .",
    "the number of these separated real eigenvalues is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "decay modes corresponding to the separated real eigenvalues are dictated by dephasing , whereas decay modes in the bulk are instead dictated by the hamiltonian .",
    "remember that in the absence of dephasing the spectrum of @xmath11 would be entirely on the imaginary axis .",
    "such distinct nature of two decay mode types is in turn reflected in two different phases of the largest decay mode , fig .",
    "[ fig : gap1mag_faze ] .",
    "indeed , if one decreases @xmath21 at fixed @xmath4 , the real eigenvalues get `` absorbed '' in the bulk , with the last one disappearing at @xmath123 , at which point a transition happens in the scaling of the gap with @xmath4 .",
    "approximate values of real eigenvalues can be obtained from the approximation with @xmath97 ( [ eq : gap1mag ] ) , resulting in a scaling of the @xmath73-th largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 as @xmath124 . in the thermodynamic limit real eigenvalues therefore cluster around the origin with their density there having a square - root singularity .",
    "it has been observed  @xcite that if the gap @xmath2 closes in the thermodynamic limit there is a possibility for an algebraic relaxation instead of an exponential one occurring when @xmath2 is finite .",
    "such an algebraic decay can be explained  @xcite by clustering of eigenvalues around @xmath42 . in our xx chain with dephasing this",
    "clustering is of the same kind as in boundary - driven free models studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and as a consequence , in the thermodynamic limit the relaxation will have a power - law form .      in the xx model",

    "we can also use a transport argument : for unitary evolution local conservation of energy holds and therefore , because the local energy current is a bounded operator , it will take at least a time @xmath207 for the energy of the initial state to be dissipated , if we choose an initial state having total energy proportional to @xmath4 .",
