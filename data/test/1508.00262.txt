    "from everyday life experiences , we learn that arbitrary operations can not do an assigned job .",
    "that is , specific resources  like allowed operations , `` free assets '' that one can use at will , and some `` force '' or catalyst in a prescribed amount  are needed to carry out a particular task .",
    "therefore , to establish a quantitative theory of any physical resource , one needs to address the following fundamental issues : ( i ) the characterization or unambiguous definition of resource , ( ii ) the quantization or valid measures , and ( iii ) the transformation or manipulation of quantum states under the imposed constraints @xcite .",
    "several useful quantum resources like purity @xcite , entanglement @xcite , reference frames @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , etc . have been identified and quantified until now .",
    "recently , baumgratz _ et al .",
    "@xcite , provided a quantitative theory of coherence as a new quantum resource , borrowing the formalism already established for entanglement @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite and reference frames @xcite .",
    "+ coherence arises from the superposition principle , aided with the tensor product structure of the hilbert space . in optics ,",
    "coherence is captured in interference results . in quantum physics , it is identified by the presence of off - diagonal terms in the density matrix , and hence is a basis - dependent quantity .",
    "it being a basis - dependent quantity , local and nonlocal unitary operations can alter the amount of coherence in a quantum system .",
    "diagonal density matrices , in any basis , have zero coherence and represent essentially the classical mixtures . coherence is defined for single as well as multipartite systems .",
    "it , being the premise of quantum correlations in multipartite systems , has attracted the attention of quantum information community significantly , and in addition to its quantification @xcite , other developments like the freezing phenomena @xcite , the coherence transformations under incoherent operations @xcite , establishment of geometric lower bound for a coherence measure @xcite , the complementarity between coherence and mixedness @xcite , its relation with other measures of quantum correlations and creation of coherence using unitary operations @xcite have been reported recently .",
    "+ in this paper , we revisit the complementarity between coherence and mixedness of a quantum state , and the distribution of coherence in multipartite systems in considerable detail .",
    "we provide several analytical and numerical results in this regard .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ meas ] , we briefly define the measures that quantify quantum coherence and mixedness . in sec .",

    "[ discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the axiomatic approach to characterize and quantify coherence , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and mixedness of a quantum system .      in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , all the diagonal states , in a given reference basis , constitute a set of incoherent states , denoted by @xmath0 . and incoherent operations , @xmath1 , are completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) maps which transform the set of incoherent states onto itself , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "a function , @xmath3 , is a valid measure of quantum coherence of the state @xmath4 if it satisfies the following conditions @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath5 iff @xmath6 .",
    "( 2a ) monotonicity under the incoherent operations , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "( 2b ) monotonicity under the selective incoherent operations on an average , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the incoherent kraus operators .",
    "that is , @xmath3 decreases on an average under the selective incoherent operations . ( 3 ) convexity or nonincreasing under mixing of quantum states , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "that is , coherence can only decrease under mixing .",
    "it is emphasized that the incoherency condition , @xmath13 , places a severe constraint on the structure of the incoherent kraus operator @xmath14 @xcite : there can be at most one nonzero entry in every column of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if the incoherent kraus operator @xmath14 belongs to the set of @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 , then the maximum number of possible structures of @xmath14 is @xmath17 .",
    "note further that conditions ( 3 ) and ( 2b ) together imply condition ( 2a ) @xcite : @xmath18    measures that satisfy the above conditions , include @xmath19 norm and relative entropy of coherence @xcite and the skew information @xcite .",
    "coherence can also be quantified through entanglement .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that entanglement measures which satisfy above conditions can be used to derive generic monotones of quantum coherence .",
    "further , the basis - independent coherence is equivalent to quantum discord @xcite , supporting the fact that coherence is a form of quantum correlation in multipartite quantum systems . viewing a @xmath20-dimensional quantum state @xmath4 , in the reference basis @xmath21 , as a @xmath22-dimensional vector ,",
    "its @xmath23 norm is @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 , which is based on @xmath19 norm , and given by @xmath27 is a valid measure of coherence @xcite .",
    "another quantity , @xmath28 , is the relative entropy of coherence , where @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , a geometric measure of coherence is also proposed @xcite which is a full coherence monotone @xcite .",
    "the geometric measure is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath0 is the set of all incoherent states and @xmath31\\right)^2 $ ] is the fidelity @xcite of the states @xmath4 and @xmath32 .",
    "the maximally coherent pure state is defined by @xmath33 @xcite , for which @xmath34 and @xmath35 .      a quantum system which is not pure is mixed .",
    "a pure quantum system described by density matrix @xmath4 is characterized by @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is called the purity of @xmath4 .",
    "noise in various forms , including inevitable interaction with environment , degrades the purity of a quantum state and renders it mixed .",
    "mixedness characterizes disorder or loss of information , and is a complementary quantity to the purity of a quantum system .",
    "there are several ways to quantify the mixedness of a quantum state in the literature . for an arbitrary @xmath20-dimensional state ,",
    "the mixedness , based on normalized linear entropy @xcite , is given as @xmath38 therefore , for every quantum system , mixedness varies between zero and unity .",
    "the other operational measures of mixedness of a quantum state @xmath4 include the von neumann entropy @xmath39 , and geometric measure of mixedness which is given by @xmath40 and lies between @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for @xmath20-dimensional pure quantum states @xmath43 in a given basis , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 vanish , @xmath46 .",
    "as mixedness is complementary to purity and purity is closely related to quantum coherence , it is natural to investigate the restrictions imposed by the mixedness of a system on its quantum coherence . in this section ,",
    "we show analytically and numerically that there exists a trade - off between the two quantities for different measures of coherence and mixedness .",
    "+ for any arbitrary quantum system @xmath4 in @xmath20 dimensions , quantum coherence , as quantified by the @xmath19 norm , and mixedness , in terms of the normalized linear entropy , satisfies the following inequality @xmath47    inequality ( [ eq : comp - l1 ] ) dictates that for a fixed amount of mixedness , the maximal amount of coherence is limited , and vice - versa .",
    "this important trade - off relation between quantum coherence and mixedness was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the parametric form of an arbitrary @xmath20-dimensional density matrix , written in terms of the generators , @xmath48 , of @xmath49 @xcite , as @xmath50 where @xmath51 $ ] . the generators @xmath48 satisfy @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 , and @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "in this representation , three - dimensional state is @xmath58 the @xmath19 norm of coherence of a @xmath20-dimensional system , given by eq .",
    "( [ qd ] ) , can be written as @xcite @xmath59 and , the mixedness is given by @xmath60    eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp - l1 ] ) ensures that the normalized coherence , @xmath61 , of a quantum system with mixedness @xmath62 , is bounded to a region below the ellipse @xmath63 .",
    "the quantum states with ( normalized ) quantum coherence that lie on the conic section are the maximally coherent states corresponding to a fixed mixedness and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "+ it is interesting to note that provided @xmath64 were a valid coherence measure , one could easily show that a complementarity relation , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp - l1 ] ) , holds : @xmath65 in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the quantity @xmath66 satisfies conditions ( 1 ) and ( 3 )",
    ". however , it fails to satisfy the condition ( 2b ) in general . since conditions ( 2b ) and ( 3 ) together",
    "imply condition ( 2a ) , it does not satisfy condition ( 2a ) .",
    "thus it is not a valid coherence measure in the framework of above resource theory .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether the reciprocity between quantum coherence and mixedness is measure specific ?",
    "put differently , does complementarity between coherence and mixedness hold for other measures of coherence and mixedness .",
    "it is trivial to note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 we observe from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : comp - l1 ] ) , ( [ eq : comp - ent ] ) and ( [ eq : comp - geom ] ) that for valid coherence measures , there is trade - off between functions of normalized coherence and normalized mixedness .",
    "this complementarity between coherence and mixedness appears to be a general feature .",
    "it would be an interesting exercise to investigate whether a given measure of coherence respects reciprocity with different measures of mixedness .",
    "in particular , we are interested in following relations : @xmath69 for rank-1 ( pure ) states , the above complementarity relations are trivially satisfied since mixedness for pure states is , by definition , zero ( for geometric measure of coherence , one will have to set @xmath70 by hand ) .",
    "surprisingly , for higher rank quantum states also the above reciprocity relations hold .",
    "we provide numerical evidences which suggest that trade - off between coherence and mixedness is indeed an extensive feature of quantum systems ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : coh - mix - reciprocity-3q ] and [ fig : coh - mix - reciprocity-4q ] ) . only the reciprocity relation , @xmath71 , is in conflict .",
    "higher is the rank of state and number of qubits , more is the violation .",
    "quantum coherence is a resource .",
    "coherence of a multiparty quantum system @xmath72 is seen as a quantum correlation amongst the subsystems .",
    "we wish to study the distribution of coherence among the constituent subsystems .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the following additivity relation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is some valid coherence measure and @xmath75 is the two - party reduced density matrix obtained after partial tracing all subsystems but subsystems @xmath76 and @xmath77 . if the above relation is satisfied for arbitrary quantum system @xmath72 , we say that the distribution of coherence is `` faithful '' with respect to subsystem @xmath76 . in the language of monogamy @xcite",
    ", @xmath74 is monogamous with respect to pivot @xmath76 .",
    "if the above relation does not hold for any @xmath72 , @xmath74 is unfaithful or non - monogamous .",
    "below we provide several interesting results on the distribution of quantum coherence in multipartite quantum systems .",
    "remember that coherence is a basis - dependent quantity . in considering following results and theorems",
    ", we assume that quantum system under investigation is described in a fixed reference basis .",
    "let @xmath78 and @xmath79 be the bases of subsystems @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , such that @xmath80 , etc .      from numerical findings listed in table [ table : coh - mono ] ,",
    "we observe a number of important results .",
    "the percent of quantum states satisfying the coherence additivity relation or `` coherence monogamy '' increases with increasing number of parties , the rank of quantum state and raising the power of coherence measure under investigation .",
    "furthermore , for fixed rank and fixed number of qubits , the number of quantum states which satisfy the monogamy condition is larger for entropy - based coherence measure than distance based coherence measure .",
    ".percent of quantum states , of varying ranks , satisfying the coherence monogamy for normalized coherence measures @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 qubits in the computational basis .",
    "coherence monogamy percent increases with increasing number of parties , the rank of quantum state and raising the power of coherence measure under investigation . for every rank , @xmath86 three",
    ", four and five qubit states are generated haar uniformly . [",

    "tripartite states satisfying the strong subadditivity relation are reported in ref .",
    "+ coherence measures , unlike entanglement measures , are not normalized in general .",
    "that is , they do not lie between zero and unity for arbitrary quantum systems .",
