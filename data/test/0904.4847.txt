    "entanglement is not only a remarkable feature which distinguishes the quantum world from the classical one but also a key resource to realize high - speed quantum computation and high - security quantum communication @xcite . in realistic quantum - information processing ,",
    "entanglement usually needs to be prepared or distributed beforehand among different remote locations .",
    "however , in the process of entanglement distribution the quantum systems are not isolated and each system will unavoidably interact with the environment .",
    "this leads to local decoherence which will degrade the entanglement of the shared states .",
    "it is thus of fundamental importance to study the entanglement properties under the influence of the local decoherence . in this context , yu and",
    "eberly @xcite investigated the time evolution of entanglement of a bipartite qubit system undergoing various modes of decoherence .",
    "remarkably , they found that , although it takes infinite time to complete the decoherence locally , the global entanglement may vanish in finite time .",
    "the phenomenon of finite - time disentanglement , also named entanglement sudden death(esd ) , unveils a fundamental difference between the global behavior of an entangled system and the local behavior of its constituents under the effect of local decoherence .",
    "clearly , esd puts an limit on the applicability of entangled states in the practical quantum information processing .",
    "initially , yu and eberly reported the esd for two - qubit entangled states , but this effect is not limited to such case .",
    "further investigations in a wider context including higher dimensional hilbert spaces have been made by various groups @xcite .",
    "there are also a number of studies looking at esd in more complicated systems using other entanglement measures @xcite , and an attempt to give a geometric interpretation of the phenomenon has also been made @xcite .",
    "in addition , experimental evidences of esd have been reported for optical setups @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "however , all previous studies omitted an important fact that high dimensional bipartite entangled states can be divided into two classes @xcite .",
    "one is free , which means that the state can be distilled under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) ; the other is bound , which means that no locc strategy is able to extract pure - state entanglement from the state even if many copies are available . bound entanglement(be )",
    "can not be used alone for quantum information processing , and irreversibility occurs in asymptotic manipulations of entanglement for all be states@xcite .",
    "since it was constructed from a pure mathematical point of view , we may ask whether be can appear in physically relevant quantum systems naturally . very recently",
    "a few works have addressed this question @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that different many - body models present thermal bound entangled states .    in this paper , we investigate the problem from a very different viewpoint , i.e. , in the present of local decoherence , which is one of the dominant noises during the distribution of entanglement .",
    "analogous to the definition of esd , if an initial free entangled state becomes non - distillable in finite time under the influence of local decoherence , then we say that it undergoes distillability sudden death(dsd ) .",
    "note that when a free entangled state loses its distillability at a specific time , it may still be entangled since we can not exclude the existence of be .",
    "so far , it is not clear whether bipartite bound entangled states can be created from free entangled states under local decoherence process naturally .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to show that such a process indeed exists through an explicit qutrit - qutrit example .",
    "afterwards we propose the dsd - free state , which has entanglement robust against local decoherence .",
    "such entangled states are thus useful resources for practical quantum - information processing .",
    "so the second aim is to address the dsd - free state .",
    "we develop a few systematic approaches to build dsd - free states .",
    "finally we will show that different from free entangled and separable states , no ppt bound entangled states exist in the infinite time limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the idea of dsd is presented . in particular , we show the phenomenon of dsd through a specific qutrit - qutrit example .",
    "in addition , we show that one can avoid the sudden death of distillability by performing a simple local unitary operation on the initial state .",
    "furthermore , we compare the behaviors of states affected by decoherence in terms of the bures fidelity . in sec .",
    "iii , we develop some methods to build dsd - free states which can protect free entanglement under general local dephasing noise .",
    "we also show that no ppt entangled states can exist in the limit of infinite time . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we discuss some open questions and also give a summary of our results .",
    "before discussing dynamical process of entanglement , we briefly review how to characterize bound entangled states .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that a quantum state with a positive partial transposition(ppt ) is non - distillable under locc .",
    "therefore ppt entangled states must be bound entangled states @xcite . to verify them",
    ", one can use the so - called realignment criterion ( cross - norm criterion ) @xcite .",
    "the definition of realignment on the density matrix is given by @xmath0 .",
    "a separable state @xmath1 always satisfies @xmath2 . for a ppt state @xmath1",
    ", the positive value of the quantity @xmath3 can hence verify that it is a bound entangled state .     as a function of time @xmath4 and dephasing rate @xmath5 for two different cases : ( a)@xmath6 ; ( b)@xmath7 . figures ( c ) and ( d ) correspond to the contour plots of the upper one , respectively .",
    "]    the system we study consists of two noninteracting qutrits in two independent local environments , each coupling to one of the qutrits . here",
    "the qutrit is a three - dimensional state composed of the computational basis @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . besides",
    ", we take the weak local dephasing noise to model the environment , such noise is indeed one of the main decoherence sources in solid - state systems .",
    "the general time - evolved density matrix expressible in the operator - sum decomposition is the completely positive trace preserving map @xcite",
    "the operators @xmath12 representing the influence of statistical noise satisfy the completeness condition @xmath13 which guarantees that the evolution is trace - preserving@xcite . in our model ,",
    "the operators are of the form @xmath14 such that @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to local dephasing noise components acting on the first and second qutrits , respectively , and both operators satisfy the completeness conditions . for simplicity , we first take these to be of the specific forms @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 identity matrix , @xmath21    for concreteness , we illustrate our ideas by considering the following qutrit - qutrit state , @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to prove that the state @xmath24 is free entangled . by using the local operation @xmath25",
    ", one can converts @xmath24 into a @xmath26 entangled state , which is afterwards distillable by virtue of the bbpssw - horodecki protocol @xcite .",
    "so the state @xmath27 is a free entangled state and we take it as the initial state under the local dephasing noise in eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "this evolution can be calculated analytically , i.e. , at time @xmath4 the two - qutrit density operator @xmath28 reads    @xmath29    where the basis are spanned by @xmath30 .",
    "let us analyze the matrix carefully .",
    "there are three eigenvalues of the partial transposition of the state @xmath31 which could be negative , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . for simplicity , we choose the local asymptotic dephasing rates @xmath35 , and thus @xmath36 in the following arguments . in order to have a vivid illustration , in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath37 as a function of t and @xmath5 with specific @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "fig.2(a ) shows the value of @xmath40 versus @xmath4 for different decoherence rates with @xmath38 , and we can see that the eigenvalue of the partial transposition of the state @xmath28 will always arrive at a positive value in finite time . for example , if we choose @xmath41 , the density matrix @xmath28 will become a ppt state after time @xmath42 in fig.2(a ) .",
    "analytically , the time at which @xmath28 becomes a ppt state is @xmath43 .",
    "next , we use realignment to verify the be in this evolution . to this end , we need to compute the quantity @xmath44 , and it is given by @xmath45 . in order to make a comparison , we plot @xmath46 as a function of time @xmath4 by choosing @xmath47 and @xmath48 in fig.2(b ) .",
    "we can see that if @xmath49 , the value of @xmath50 is always positive , which indicates that in the range @xmath51 , the two - qutrit system is a bound entanglement state .",
    "thus we have shown that free initial entangled states can evolve into non - distillable ( bound)entangled states in finite time under the local external asymtotic dephasing noise .     versus time @xmath4 for different dephasing rates .",
    "the solid , dash - dotted , and dashed lines correspond to @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "( b ) the quantity @xmath54 versus time @xmath4 for @xmath48 . the other parameter @xmath38 . ]",
    "besides we find that with @xmath55 and @xmath48 , the state @xmath28 will be separable when @xmath56 .",
    "it could be proved by extracting three `` @xmath57 '' density operators , which are respectively spanned by @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , from the state @xmath28",
    ". then one can find out that the condition @xmath56 makes the three states separable . as the state",
    "@xmath28 is actually the linear combination of the above three states and some product states , @xmath28 also becomes separable when @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a small window @xmath61 $ ] in which the state @xmath28 has merely ppt and we do nt know whether it s entangled or separable .",
    "to summarize the example , start from the initial state @xmath62 in @xmath23 the qutrit - qutrit state @xmath28 will experience three phases under the local dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) : it evolves from an initial distillable entangled state to a ppt entangled state , and then changes to be a separable state and finally remains in this phase for even .",
    "in other word , @xmath28 first experiences dsd and then esd under local decoherence .",
    "in contrast with the above example , we briefly consider the initial state @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in this case , it is a ppt entangled state @xcite , one can verify that the state @xmath28 will finally become separable in finite time under the local dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) ; that is , @xmath28 only experiences esd .",
    "moreover , we can easily verify the time - domain factorization relation as follows ,    @xmath64    where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 denotes the noise in eq.(1 ) . because the entanglement can not increase under the local operations ,",
    "we conclude that if a state becomes separable at a specific time in eq.(1 ) , it must remain separable in all subsequent time .",
    "more generally , if an entangled state evolves into a ppt state ( either entangled or separable ) at a specific time in eq.(1 ) , it always has ppt for all subsequent time since the local operation can not change ppt .    of course , such disappearance of distillability in finite time can seriously affect the application of entanglement in quantum information tasks .",
    "an important question arises naturally : given a free initial entangled state , does there exist a suitable intervention that may alter the final fate of dsd ? in the following",
    "we show that one can realize this aim by merely performing a simple local unitary operation on the initial state in the above example .",
    "let the initial local operation be @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "then , the transformed state is @xmath69 where the projectors are @xmath70    evidently , the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 are equally useful quantum resources without decoherence . in ref.@xcite , horodecki demonstrated that @xmath73 is a free entangled state for @xmath74 .",
    "it will evolve into @xmath75 according to eq.(1 ) , whose partial transpose always has a negative eigenvalue in finite time @xmath4 .",
    "so @xmath75 never experiences esd when subjecting only to the local dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the state @xmath76 does not undergo dsd in finite time . to see this",
    ", we perform the local operation @xmath77 on @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting two - qubit state is easily proved to be entangled and hence distillable in finite time @xmath4 .",
    "so the state @xmath78 can always be distilled under the local dephasing noise .    by",
    "far we have considered dsd in the presence of local dephase noise .",
    "another useful physical quantity in quantum - information problems is the fidelity , which measures to what extent the evolved state is close to the initial one . for concreteness",
    ", we study the states @xmath28 and @xmath79 by means of the bures fidelity @xcite . the bures fidelity of states @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath80 is defined as @xmath81 ^ 2 $ ] . for the state @xmath82 ,",
    "the fidelity is given by    @xmath83 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    while for @xmath84 it reads    @xmath85 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) indicate that the fidelities do not depend on the coefficient @xmath86 . in fig.3 , we plot @xmath87 and @xmath88 as the function of t with @xmath89 .",
    "obviously , the fidelity @xmath90 is always larger than @xmath91 , which means that @xmath92 degrades faster than @xmath93 . in the infinite time limit",
    ", the values of @xmath88 and @xmath91 will approach to @xmath94 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath95",
    "^ 2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "thus , we have shown that @xmath93 have the advantages over @xmath92 in two aspects : firstly , it does not experience dsd in finite time .",
    "secondly , its fidelity decays slower than that of @xmath96 for all time .     for different initial states .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath91 and @xmath88 with @xmath97 , respectively . ]",
    "in the last section we have presented the examples of qutrit - qutrit states with and without dsd .",
    "we call the latter as dsd - free states , which always have negative partial transposition ( npt ) .",
    "npt is a necessary condition for distillability under locc , so the dsd - free states are available resource for quantum - information tasks as they have robust entanglement against local dephasing noise described in eq.(1 ) .",
    "it is thus worth finding out diverse dsd - free states in terms of different kinds of local dephasing noises . in this sense ,",
    "dsd - free states deserve storage in quantum - information `` warehouse '' and they are more useful than dsd states . on the other hand , one can also directly propose schemes of quantum information processing based on the robustness of dsd - free states .",
    "we now turn to develop several approaches to construct dsd - free states for an arbitrary qutrit - qutrit state @xmath80 . as a direct method",
    ", we can locally project a few copies of the state @xmath98 onto some @xmath99 states .",
    "such states are distillable ( dsd - free ) under locc , if and only if they have npt in finite time @xcite .",
    "generally , it s difficult to find out the projectors and there have been a few results on this problem @xcite .",
    "here we only investigate one copy of @xmath100 under the dephasing noise described in eq.(1 ) .",
    "for example :    * lemma 1*. consider an npt entangled state @xmath101 and it experiences the local dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) .",
    "then @xmath102 is always distillable in finite time , when @xmath103 or @xmath104 is entangled .    _",
    "proof_. one can get the above given state by projecting @xmath102 with the projector @xmath105 on system @xmath106 or @xmath107 on system @xmath108 respectively ( both projectors actually have nothing to do with time @xmath4 when separately used as operators ) .",
    "since the given state is a distillable qubit - qutrit entangled state , the assertion follows from @xcite .",
    "it s interesting to note that the given state is just the sum of the third and fourth terms in eq.(1 ) . @xmath109",
    "lemma 1 actually requires to check the ppt of some @xmath110 matrices depending on time @xmath4 , which could be done by using mathematics .",
    "this is a systematic way to build the subspace of robust entangled states that never experience dsd in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . to show the connection between the last section and lemma 1 , we propose a weak version of lemma 1 as follows .    *",
    "lemma 2*. suppose @xmath111 are entangled , then the states @xmath101 are dsd - free states in local dephasing noise eq.(1 ) .    _",
    "proof_. the state @xmath103 is entangled when @xmath111 is entangled .",
    "the assertion then follows from lemma 1 .",
    "@xmath109    one may see that the state @xmath112 in the previous section belongs to the case of lemma 2 .",
    "the advantage of lemma 2 is that the density operators @xmath111 do not contain time @xmath4 and are convenient for calculation .",
    "this result is reasonable for the local dephasing noise described in eq.(1 ) which occurs only between the ground state @xmath113 and the @xmath114th ( @xmath115 ) excited state .    the model in eq.(1 )",
    "is neither the simplest case of local dephasing nor the most general case . in the most general case dephasing",
    "occurs between all local basis states within each subsystem . in what follows",
    "we put forward some results under such general local dephasing noise @xcite .    *",
    "lemma 3*. qutrit - qutrit entangled mc states are dsd - free states in general local dephasing noise .    _",
    "proof_. let us consider the qutrit - qutrit maximally correlated ( mc ) states @xmath116 , which read @xcite @xmath117 we make it go through the channel of general local dephasing noise .",
    "as we know , such noise can not change the diagonal elements and the non - diagonal elements of the evolved state have non - zero dephasing values for any finite time .",
    "so the evolved state @xmath118 is still a mc state . on the other hand ,",
    "the mc state is separable if and only if all non - diagonal entries are zero .",
    "then @xmath118 is always entangled for all finite @xmath4 whenever the initial state @xmath116 is entangled .",
    "furthermore , one may prove that @xmath118 can always be distillable by using the similar argument to show the distillability of the state @xmath119 in the previous section.@xmath109    this example enlightens us on building dsd - free entangled states in a stronger way , i.e. ,    * lemma 4*. we perform the local operation @xmath120 on any initial qutrit - qutrit state , where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are chosen from the basis 0 , 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "if the projected state is an entangled mc state , then the initial state is a dsd - free state in general local dephasing noise.@xmath109    one can prove lemma 4 by showing that there are always some nonzero non - diagonal entries of the projected state , and we can take it as the new initial state in the local dephasing noise .",
    "evidently , the newly built state in lemma 4 contains mc states in lemma 3 .",
    "these results can be extended to the scenario of higher dimension .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the general mc state @xmath123 .",
    "suppose it experiences generalized local dephasing noise .",
    "analogous to the arguments for lemma 3 , one can see that the state @xmath124 also has no dsd in finite time .",
    "thus we have provided a high dimensional subspace @xmath125 in which all entangled states are distillable under local dephasing noise ; that is ,    * lemma 5*. entangled mc states are dsd - free states in general local dephasing noise .",
    "@xmath109    one can also build other higher dimensional dsd - free states , which could be locally projected onto entangled mc states by following the techniques for lemma 4 . as a short summary , lemma 1 to 5",
    "give a few primary results on dsd - free states in finite time , in terms of the special dephasing noise eq.(1 ) and general dephasing noise respectively .",
    "to gain a better understanding of the entanglement dynamics , we further study the properties of the evolved state in the infinite - time limit , which is summarized as the following lemma .",
    "* lemma 6*. for any qutrit - qutrit state under the dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) , the final evolved state could be separable or eternally distillable in the infinite - time limit , but no ppt entangled sate can exist as time goes to infinity .    _",
    "proof_. let us briefly justify the above statement . consider an arbitrary qutrit - qutrit state @xmath80 under the action of an infinite time of local dephasing , then the final state @xmath126 can always be written as : @xmath127 .",
    "there are four terms in all , and each of them corresponds to one of the terms in eq.(1 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the first three terms could be removed by the local operator @xmath128 and it does not change the fourth term . so the evolved state @xmath129 is entangled if and only if the fourth term is entangled .",
    "it immediately implies that the state @xmath130 could be separable or eternally npt and distillable in the infinite time limit . as we have seen in the previous sections ,",
    "both cases also exist in finite time s evolution .",
    "since the entanglement property of the evolved state is determined by the two - qubit state , then we conclude that any ppt entangled state is unstable as time goes to infinity under the local dephasing noise in eq.(1 ) . in contrast , it s still an open question whether there always exists ppt entangled state in finite time s evolution . @xmath109",
    "before concluding we would like to discuss some open questions as follow :    firstly , the initial state in our scheme is a free entangled state .",
    "we have shown that it may evolve into a ppt entangled state and then a separable state for finite time ; it may also be eternally free entangled for all finite time in the local dephasing noise described by eq.(1 ) .",
    "we have also shown that any qutrit - qutrit ppt entangled state will lose its entanglement as time goes to infinity in our decoherence model .",
    "then an open question is whether ppt entanglement can be preserved in any finite time under ( general ) local dephasing noise ?",
    "if the answer is no ( supported by the calculation in sec.ii ) , then we have another interesting difference between the free and bound entangled state : that is , the former can be robust against the decoherence in any time while the latter can not .",
    "secondly , we have proposed a few systematic methods to build dsd - free subspaces for @xmath131 state , in which all states keep their distillability asymptotically in local dephasing noise .",
    "the primary extension to higher dimensional bipartite system has also been proposed .",
    "it s then an open question to find out more entangled states which are robust against different local noises ( beyond our model ) in any dimensional space .",
    "such states are applicable to quantum information schemes and thus deserve a deeper study .    in summary ,",
    "we have introduced the concept of dsd through an explicit qutrit - qutrit state .",
    "we found that under the bi - local dephasing noise , the free entangled state may evolve into a ppt entangled state ( dsd ) and then become separable ( esd ) permanently .",
    "moreover , a simple local unitary operation on the initial state can avoid the sudden death of distillability .",
    "we also have compared the action of dsd and dsd - free states in terms of the bures fidelity .",
    "next , we have proposed the systematic methods of building the dsd - free space against decoherence , so that the evolved states are distillable in finite time .",
    "finally , we proved that there is no ppt entangled state in infinite - time limit in our model .",
    "our results imply that further study on free entanglement with time evolution in practical local noises is required .",
