    "since the first optical counterpart of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) was identified on 1997 february 28 , more and more grbs have been optically detected , especially after _ swift _ was launched successfully , which allows early follow - up observations with ground - based optical telescopes . however , about 40 per cent of _ swift _ grbs still failed to be identified with optical or infrared counterparts ( burrows et al .",
    "2008 ) . for the nature of the dark burst ,",
    "several models have been proposed : extinction from dusty opaque star - forming regions ( e.g. groot et al .",
    "1998 ; reichart & price 2002 ) ; high redshift , which diminishes the grb optical luminosity ( lamb & reichart 2000 ) , as the ly@xmath6 forest is shifted into the observational energy range ; intrinsically dim bursts ( fynbo et al . 2001 ; rol et al . 2005 ) ; the observational effect , as a result of the late response to the bursts .",
    "jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have proposed an operational definition of dark burst ( i.e. optical - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath7 ) , according to the fireball model .",
    "however , grbs with an optical afterglow have been studied widely and in depth(e.g .",
    "grb 060218 , grb 080319b ) . this has resulted in an increasing number of grbs with known redshift , which has allowed statistical studies to be carried out .",
    "the optical luminosity distribution of grbs varies widely up to several magnitudes ( kann et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) . after being transformed into a common redshift ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) ,",
    "the optical luminosity shows a bi - model phenomenon ( nardini et al .",
    "2006 ; liang et al . 2006 ; kann et al . 2006 ; 2008 ) : optically luminous and optically dim .",
    "the bi - model distribution is also found to exist in other energy bands ( gendre et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "liang & zhang ( 2006 ) found that the apparent bimodality can not be interpreted as a manifestation of the extinction effect , and they suggested that there might be two types of progenitors or two types of explosion mechanisms in operation . considering the dark burst is usually a type of grbs with a faint optical afterglow , optically dim bursts might be related to dark bursts ( nardini et al .",
    "however , the number of well - studied optically dim bursts is very limited . thus , increasing the number of known optically dim bursts may help us to understand the origin of the bi - model distribution , the nature of optically dim bursts and dark bursts .",

    "1 , the extrapolation of the first fitting is below the data detected after 1000 sec , suggesting that there is energy injection ( zhang et al . 2006 ) between the two segments , shown as a shallow decay . therefore , the x - ray light curve displays a `` steep - shallow - normal '' decays ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) .      the first steep decay in the x - ray afterglow light curve is usually explained by the curvature effect ( e.g. kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; zhang et al .",
    "according to their model , temporal index @xmath6 and spectral index @xmath41 have a tight relation @xmath42 . for grb 070518 ,",
    "the first slope @xmath43 ( 1.78 ) of the x - ray light curve is definitely lower than the value ( 3.22 , from @xmath44 ) expected for high - latitude emission ( here , @xmath45 from uss ) .",
    "however , the high - latitude effect only provides an upper limit to the decay slope , as it assumes that the shell emission stops abruptly after the initial pulse ( mangano et al .",
    "the decline could be made in two cases : one is that residual emission from the shocked shells is still present , in which , the high - latitude emission would contribute only a small fraction of the overall radiation ; the other is that the x - ray band is below the cooling frequency , in which case , the expected decay slope of high - latitude radiation would naturally be shallower than 2 . for grb 070518 , the first possibility might be more reasonable , from the analysis for other segments of the x - ray light curve in the later sections .",
    "the x - ray afterglow is analyzed by applying the closure relations given by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to the x - ray spectral and temporal indices .",
    "these relations help us to determine the location of the observed x - ray band relative to the synchrotron frequencies ( @xmath46,@xmath47,@xmath48 ) and the environment where the burst occurred .",

    "the application of the closure relations to the x - ray temporal and spectral index in normal decay segment , combining the analysis in @xmath16 3.1 for the x - ray afterglow during 2000@xmath02@xmath55sec , suggests that there is energy injection before the start of the normal decay phase .",
    "the x - ray light curve of grb 070518 shows drastic flares between 80 and 200s since the trigger , as shown in the insert in the fig . 1 .",

    "such steep and large amplitude rises in the observed flux , as in grb 070518 , could not be explained by a sudden increase in the external density ( nakar & granot 2007 ) .",
    "another model , a patchy shell model , can produce the flare with @xmath56f / f of about 1 ( nakar & oren 2004 ) , athough it can not interpret the flares with @xmath56t / t @xmath57 0.1 .",
    "for two big flares of grb 070518 , @xmath56t / t are about 0.2 and 0.1,respectively .",
    "therefore , the model might be possible .",
    "moreover , such dramatic flares are also related to refreshed shocks or the central engine activity ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "this is more reasonable for the case of grb 070518 , if we consider the above analysis that energy injection was still occurred after these flares .",
    "chromatic decay could be seen in the case of grb 070518 , as shown in fig .",

    "the decay index of the optical light curve ( @xmath58=0.87 ) is slightly smaller than that of the normal decay segment ( 0.99 ) of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "the normal decay segment is usually explained the external shock model ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , as expected for the optical afterglow .",
    "however , the origin of the normal phase might also be related to the internal energy dissipation ( see as the discussion by urata et al .",
    "thus , the classical external shock model will tested with the burst . according to the model",

    ", we try to estimate the extinction along the line - of - sight to the burst . the observed neutral hydrogen column density along this line - of - sight to grb 070518 determined by xrt onboard _",
    "swift _ is about @xmath101 cm@xmath65 ( guidorzi et al .",
    "2007 ) , larger than the previously measured galactic value ( @xmath103 ; dickey & lockman , 1990 ) .",
    "the excess value is about @xmath104 cm@xmath65 .",
    "if the excess value is from a previously unobserved over - density located within or close to our galaxy , then the excess extinction @xmath105 would be obtained with the excess value of neutral hydrogen , based on the relation found by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) : @xmath106 + 0.23 $ ] mag .",
    "if this is the case , extinction should not be a prominent cause for the optically dim luminosity .",
    "it is likely that the excess column density is located within the host galaxy of grb 070518 . as in the discussion for grb 051022 ( nysewander et al .",
    "2006 ) , the rest frame @xmath107 is given by the observed @xmath108 .",
    "the source frame is about @xmath109 with z=0.7 . from the relation of host extinction @xmath110 mag ( nysewander et al .",

    "clearly , under these conditions , high extinction would be a dominate cause of the optically dim luminosity of grb 070518 .",
    "however , all above estimates are made with an assumption of the milky way - type extinction .",
    "the optical extinction from the measured @xmath107 absorption should depend on the assumed dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "some evidence shows that the extinction law in the grb host galaxy is likely to be a small magellanic clouds ( smc ) type . using the small dust - to - gas ratio of the smc ( pei 1992 ) , the host extinction @xmath112 would be 0.3 mag when @xmath77 .",
    "the difference of the extinction value estimated above is very large , about a factor of 10 .",
    "actually , the real extinction law in the grb host galaxy is uncertain in most cases , like grb 050401 , for example , the extinction @xmath2 is estimated to be @xmath113 by fitting the optical spectrum , which is lower than the value @xmath114 inferred from the x - ray column density ( watson et al .",
    "one reason for the case of grb 050401 was that high energy release of gamma - ray and hard x - ray photons might destroy the circumburst dust in the grb host galaxy ( watson et al .",

    "the low value of extinction from host galaxy of grb 050416a implies that the extinction of host galaxy of grb 070518 might be not large , only about @xmath122 , as analyzed in @xmath163.4 .",
    "optically dim bursts might be related to dark bursts ( nardini et al .",

    "they calculated @xmath123 for the bursts in their catalogue at 1000s after the trigger time .",
    "however , it is too early for most of the _ swift _ bursts to carry out the calculation at 1000s after the trigger , because the x - ray light curves in some _ swift _ grbs might be at the steep or shallow decay segment about this time .",
