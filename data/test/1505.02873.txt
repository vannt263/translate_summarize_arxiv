    "the theory of semileptonic ( sl ) @xmath8 decays is a rich and well - studied subject  @xcite . within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "this has been widely used to probe the nature of the electroweak interaction and the structure of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in particular",
    ", the ckm matrix elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be extracted from the rates of the processes @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an exclusive charm or charmless meson state , respectively .",
    "the full differential rate in the sm for these processes have been previously presented by several authors in refs .",
    "the current article extends these results in the following fashion . instead of assuming the relevant helicity amplitudes to be relatively real , as is the current status ,",
    "we provide expressions corresponding to complex amplitudes .",
    "a specific motivation for admitting complex amplitudes in sl decays is to consider , instead of a purely left - handed ( lh ) weak charged current as in the sm , an additional complex right - handed ( rh ) admixture , @xmath13 , that could arise in new physics ( np ) scenarios , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rh_np ]  @xcite .",
    "a complex non - zero @xmath13 leads to additional angular terms in the full differential rate .",
    "in particular , a non - zero phase in @xmath13 can lead to cp violation in sl @xmath8 decays  @xcite .",
    "consider on the other hand the process @xmath14 , where @xmath3 subsequently decays into two pseudoscalars , and the charged di - lepton system can be either be a @xmath6 resonance ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) or non - resonant electroweak penguins ( ewp ) .",
    "it is well known that the helicity amplitudes here have non - zero relative phases  @xcite .",
    "compared to the sl case , where the leptonic current is purely lh , both lh and rh components exist for the charged di - lepton case .",
    "the lh and rh terms add incoherently to give the total rate .",
    "therefore , while the number of angular observables remain the same , the number of independent real amplitude components to extract increases almost two - fold .",
    "the angular observables are not independent which leads to ambiguities in the solutions for the amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "a simplification occurs for the case where the di - lepton is a resonant @xmath17 meson that decays electromagnetically . since electromagnetic interactions",
    "conserve parity , the lh and rh amplitudes are equal for this case .",
    "the reduced number of real amplitude components result in a single two - fold ambiguity , as explained in sec .",

    "the sl and the resonant @xmath17 instances represent special cases leading to certain simplifications .",
    "we expand the full angular expression in an orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics and provide moments to project out each angular component . since the basis is orthonormal , this reduces to a simple counting measurement .",
    "we explain how to extract the covariance matrix of the moments and the treatment of background subtraction , again , as counting measurements . as long as the set of basis functions is `` large - enough ''",

    "an important feature of sl @xmath8 decays is that the leptonic side interaction is well - understood , thereby facilitating study of the complicated non - perturbative qcd interactions that reside on the hadronic side .",
    "the momentum transfer squared between the leptonic and hadronic systems is @xmath25 .",
    "the hadronic side is thus probed by the @xmath25 dependent form - factors ( ff ) , just like in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , save that @xmath26 is now timelike , instead of spacelike in the dis case . for the ewp case",

    "if the model - dependence is reliably known , the mom and a direct uml fit give the same results , as we explicitly demostrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : toy_studies ] .",
    "however , if the underlying physics model is unknown , the mom can provide simple and model - independent confirmations of certain interesting physics features .",
    "for example , as pointed out in the introduction , a complex rh admixture @xmath13 in the weak hadronic current leads to angular terms proportional to @xmath113 in sl decays , that are absent in the sm .",
    "the presence of these terms in the data can be examined using any of the moments in table  [ table : spd_mom_trans ] corresponding to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 .",
    "if the statistical significance of these moments are found to be high enough , this could constitute tension with the sm .",
    "similarly , the observables @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 can be individually expressed in terms of the moments in table  [ table : spd_mom_trans ] .",
    "therefore , if one is interested in the presence of a @xmath119-wave component under the @xmath120 for @xmath121 , this can be directly probed via the moments . in the absence of a @xmath119-wave component , the observables @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    "can also be extracted directly from the moments , allowing an estimate of the @xmath124-wave fraction . for the observable @xmath125  @xcite",
    "that is predicted to be theoretically clean at low @xmath25 , the lhcb collaboration has recently observed  @xcite a @xmath126 deviation from the sm . in the absence of non-@xmath127-wave components ,",
    "this can be written in terms of the moments as : @xmath128 the important point to note here is that no complicated multi - dimensional angular fit is required for any of these checks .",
    "we would also like to comment on the use of the normalization integrals in eq .",
    "[ eqn : norm_ints ] as opposed to analytic modeling of the efficiency function and reweighting of events by the inverse of the efficiency .",
    "the latter involves a complicated fit which can be unstable without due to local `` holes '' in the acceptance function .",
    "the normalization integrals , on the other hand , are found to be more robust under these situations .",
    "in summary , we provide expressions for the full angular decay rate in @xmath129 decays where the @xmath2 lepton can be either a charged @xmath130 or a neutrino .",
    "we considered the final state @xmath3 to include complex @xmath124- , @xmath127 , and @xmath119-wave amplitudes .",
    "the rate expression is expanded in a basis of orthonormal moments functions and a procedure to extract the corresponding moments employing a counting measurement is desribed and validated .",
    "we expect the present work to be directly applicable to ongoing analyses at @xmath7 and lhcb .",
