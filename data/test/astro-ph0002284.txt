    "in very diffuse parts of the sky ( no molecular clouds and hii regions ) , the far - ir emission can be written as the sum of dust emission associated with the neutral gas , dust associated with the ionised gas , interplanetary dust emission and the cfirb ( and eventually the cosmological dipole and cmb ) . in previous studies (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) ,",
    "dust emission associated with the ionised gas which was totally unknown has been either not subtracted properly or neglected .",
    "+ we have detected for the first time dust emission in the ionised gas (  @xcite ) and shown that the emissivity ( which is the ir emission normalised to unit hydrogen column density ) of dust in the ionised gas was nearly the same as that in the neutral gas .",
    "this has consequences on the determination of the cfirb . following this first detection ,",
    "we have combined hi and wham h@xmath0 data (  @xcite ) with far - ir cobe data in order to derive dust properties in the diffuse ionised gas as well as to make a proper determination of the cfirb .",
    "technically , after a careful pixel selection ( see  @xcite for more details ) we describe the far - infrared dust emission as a function of the hi and h@xmath2 column density by : @xmath3 where n(hi)@xmath4 and n(h@xmath2)@xmath4 are the column densities normalised to 10@xmath5 h @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficients a , b and the constant term c are determined simultaneously using regression fits .",
    "we show that about 25@xmath7 of the ir emission comes from dust associated with the ionised gas which is in very good agreement with the first determination (  @xcite ) .",
    "the cfirb spectrum obtained using this far - infrared emission decomposition is shown in fig .",
    "[ cfirb_spec ] together with the cfirb firas determination of  @xcite in the lockman hole region .",
    "we see a very good agreement between the two spectra .",
    "these determinations are also in good agreement with  @xcite .",
    "m. ]    at 140 and 240 @xmath1 m , the values obtained for the cfirb are 1.13@xmath80.54 mjy / sr and 0.88@xmath80.55 mjy / sr respectively for each selected pixel , we compute the residual emission , r = ir - a@xmath9n(hi ) - b@xmath9n(h@xmath2 ) . uncertainties of the cfirb have been derived from the width of the histogram of r ( statistical uncertainties derived from the regression analysis are negligible ) . the obtained cfirb values , although much more noisy ( due to the small fraction of the sky used ) , are in very good agreement with the determination of  @xcite . at 140  @xmath1 m , the cfirb value of  @xcite is smaller than that derived here since the assumed wim ( warm ionised gas ) dust spectrum was overestimated ( the wim dust spectrum was very noisy below 200  @xmath1 m and the estimated dust temperature was too high ) . + at 100  @xmath1 m , assuming an accurate subtraction of the zodiacal emission , our decomposition gives : i@xmath10(100)= 0.78@xmath80.21 mjy / sr .",
    "this is the first time that two independent gas tracers for the hi and the h@xmath2 have been used to determine the background at 100 @xmath1 m .",
    "one has to note that methods based on the intercept of the far - ir / hi correlation for the determination of the cfirb are dangerous .",
    "for example , for our selected parts of the sky , this intercept is about 0.91 mjy / sr , which is quite different from the value of the cfirb ( 0.78 mjy / sr ) .",
    "the cfirb value of 0.78 mjy / sr can be compared to the non - isotropic residual emission found by  @xcite .",
    "the average over three regions of the residual emission , equal to 0.73@xmath80.20 mjy / sr , is in very good agreement with our determination .",
    "+ so we see , using different approaches , that we are now converging on the shape and level of the cfirb above 100 @xmath1 m .",
    "the next step is to see if we can detect its fluctuations and study them .",
    "the cfirb is made of sources with number counts as a function of flux which can be represented , for the present discussion , by a simple power law : @xmath11 obviously , these number counts need to flatten at low fluxes to insure a finite value of the background .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath12=0 for @xmath13 . + for the simple euclidian case ( @xmath12=1.5 ) , the cfirb integral is dominated by sources near s@xmath14 and its fluctuations",
    "are dominated by sources which are just below the detection limit s@xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that strong cosmological evolution , associated with a strong negative k - correction , could lead to a very steep number count distribution ( see for example  @xcite and  @xcite ) . in the far - ir present observations",
    "show a very steep slope of @xmath12=2.2 (  @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the cfirb integral is still dominated by sources near s@xmath14 but its fluctuations are now also dominated by sources close to s@xmath14 . thus , it is essential to study the extra - galactic background fluctuations which are likely to be dominated by sources with a flux comparable to those dominating the cfirb intensity .",
    "+ to see if we can detect the cfirb fluctuations , we need wide field far - ir observations with high angular resolution and very high signal to noise ratio . the firback project , which is a very deep cosmological survey with isophot at 170 @xmath1 m (  @xcite ) , sustains all these conditions . to search for cfirb fluctuations ,",
    "we have first used the so - called `` marano 1 '' field for which we obtained 16 independent coadded maps which allow us to determine very properly the instrumental noise . in this field",
    ", we have a signal to noise ratio of about 300 and we detect 24 sources (  @xcite ) that we remove from the original map .",
    "we then extend our first analysis to the other firback fields .",
    "details on the data reduction and calibration can be found in  @xcite .",
    "+ source subtracted maps show background fluctuations which are made of two components that we want to separate , galactic cirrus fluctuations and if present the extra - galactic ones .",
    "our separation of the extra - galactic and galactic fluctuations is based on a power spectrum decomposition .",
    "this method allows us to discriminate the two components using the statistical properties of their spatial behaviour .",
    "[ fluc_marano ] shows the power spectrum of the `` marano 1 '' field . in the plane of the detector ,",
    "the power spectrum measured on the map can be expressed in the form : @xmath16 where p@xmath17 is the instrumental noise power spectrum measured using the 16 independent maps of the marano 1 field (  @xcite ) , p@xmath18 and p@xmath19 are the cirrus and unresolved extra - galactic source power spectra respectively , and w@xmath20 is the footprint power spectrum . for our analysis ,",
    "we remove p@xmath17 from p@xmath21 . + we know from previous work that the cirrus far - infrared emission power spectrum , p@xmath18 , has a steep slope in @xmath22 (  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these observations cover the relevant spatial frequency range and have been recently extended up to 1 arcmin using very diffuse hi data (  @xcite ) .",
    "the extra - galactic component is unknown but certainly much flatter ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the steep spectrum observed in our data at k@xmath230.15 arcmin@xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fluc_marano ] ) can only be due to cirrus emission .",
    "the break in the power spectrum at k@xmath25 0.2 arcmin@xmath24 is very unlikely to be due to the cirrus emission itself which is known not to exhibit any prefered scale (  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the normalisation of our cirrus power spectrum p@xmath18 is directly determined using the low frequency data points and assuming a k@xmath26 dependence . +    ) .",
    "the instrumental noise power spectrum ( dotted line ) has been subtracted .",
    "the dashed line represents the cirrus power spectrum , multiplied by the footprint . ]",
    "we clearly see in fig .",
    "[ fluc_marano ] an excess over p@xmath18 between k=0.25 and 0.6 arcmin@xmath24 which is more than a factor of 10 at k=0.4 arcmin@xmath24 .",
    "any reasonable power law spectrum for the cirrus component multiplied by the footprint leads , as can be easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fluc_marano ] , to a very steep spectrum at spatial frequency k@xmath270.2 arcmin@xmath24 which is very different from the observed spectrum .",
    "moreover , the excess is more than 10 times larger than the measured instrumental noise power spectrum . therefore , as no other major source of fluctuations is expected at this wavelength , the large excess observed between k=0.25 and 0.6 arcmin@xmath24 is interpreted as due to unresolved extra - galactic sources .",
    "this is the first detection of the cfirb fluctuations .",
    "+ the marano 1 field can not be used to constrain the clustering of galaxies due to it rather small size .",
    "however , the extra - galactic source power spectrum mean level can be determined .",
    "we obtain p@xmath19  =  7400 jy@xmath28/sr , which is in very good agreement with the one predicted by  @xcite .",
    "this gives cfirb rms fluctuations around 0.07 mjy / sr ( for a range of spatial frequencies up to 5 arcmin@xmath24 ) .",
    "these fluctuations are at the @xmath259 percent level , which is very close to the predictions of  @xcite .",
    "+ the same analysis can be done for the other and larger firback fields . from eq .",
    "[ eq_pk ] , we deduce : @xmath29 fig .  [ fluc_n2 ] shows the extra - galactic fluctuation power spectrum ( p@xmath19 ) obtained for the firback / elais n2 field .",
    "it is very well fitted with a constant cfirb fluctuation power spectrum of about 5000 jy@xmath28/sr , which is in good agreement with that obtained in the `` marano 1 '' field .",
    "we obtain also exactly the same extra - galactic fluctuation power spectrum in the firback n1 field with a value of about 5000 jy@xmath28/sr .",
    "we have shown in the firback fields that the extra - galactic background fluctuations lie well above the instrumental noise and the cirrus confusion noise .",
    "the observed power spectrum shows a flattening at high spatial frequencies which is due to unresolved extra - galactic sources .",
    "the level of the extra - galactic power spectrum fluctuations is nearly the same in all firback fields .",
    "the next step consists of removing the cirrus contribution using independent gas tracers ( the h@xmath0 and the 21 cm emission lines ) to isolate the extra - galactic fluctuation brightness and try to constrain the ir large scale structures ."
