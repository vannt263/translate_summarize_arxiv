    "at the institut fr kernphysik in mainz , germany , the microtron mami has been upgraded to 1.5gev electron beam energy  @xcite .",
    "the microtron delivers an electron beam with excellent spatial and energy definition that can now be used to study strange hadronic systems produced on solid - state or liquid cryogenic targets .",
    "the elementary electro - production of kaons off the proton is used mainly as a test of production mechanisms .",
    "effective field theories expressed in terms of resonant baryon formation and kaon exchange  @xcite have been successfully applied to describe the data . however , in contrast to the well studied flavour @xmath5 sector , more precision data in the threshold energy region are needed . also for calculating hypernuclear production cross - sections ,",
    "precise data from very forward angle kaon production are urgently required . in this",
    "kinematics the elementary amplitude serves as the basic input , which determines the accuracy of predictions for hypernuclei  @xcite .    for the strangeness",
    "programme the  spectrometer was recently dismantled at the sis facility at gsi and re - installed in the spectrometer hall at mami .  is a very compact magnetic spectrometer suitable especially for the detection of kaons  @xcite .",
    "the first - order focusing is achieved in the set - up at mami with a bending of the central trajectories on both sides by @xmath6 45@xmath7 with a momentum dispersion of 2.2@xmath8% for the hadron arm and 4.0@xmath8% for the electron arm . from the magnet optics , the beam diameter , and the spatial resolution in the focal - surface a first order momentum resolution of @xmath9 10@xmath10",
    "is expected .",
    "the tracking of particles through  is performed by means of two large mwpc with a total of 2 @xmath11 310 analogue channels .",
    "five cathode wires are connected together and are brought to one charge sensitive pre - amplifier followed by an adc card .",
    "the transputer - based read - out system is connected to a multi - link card of a front - end computer . to determine the particle track the measured charge distributions are analysed by the centre - of - gravity method .",
    "particle identification in the  spectrometer is based on the particle s time - of - flight and its specific energy loss .",
    "a segmented scintillator wall with 30 paddles read out at both ends by fast photomultipliers is located near the focal - surface and measures the arrival time .",
    "a second wall with 30 paddles is used to discriminate valid tracks against background events . a top  bottom mean timing for deriving the trigger",
    "is performed by summing the analogue signals .",
    "the signal amplitudes were corrected for the particle s path - length through the scintillator bulk material and the light absorption inside the paddle .",
    "reaction before and after corrections for the flight - time and trigger - time jitter .",
    "a gaussian distribution on top of a constant background was fitted to the corrected spectrum .",
    "the width of the @xmath12 peak is @xmath13 1.07ns , which is a typical inter - spectrometer time resolution.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the time spectrum is systematically broadened by the propagation time dispersion inside the scintillator , the time differences between different scintillator paddles and their associated electronic channels , and by the variation of the time - of - flight , being proportional to the path - length through the spectrometer .",
    "the coincidence time spectrum for the p@xmath14 reaction before and after corrections is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof ] , where the flight time , @xmath15 , was corrected by using the reconstructed momentum , @xmath16 , and path - length , @xmath17 , under the assumption that a pion was detected .",
    "the gaussian width of the @xmath12 peak is @xmath13 1.07ns , which is a typical inter - spectrometer time resolution .",
    "the necessity of the pion and proton suppression is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] where the mass distribution of the detected particles , @xmath18 , is shown under the effect of specific energy - loss cuts .",
    "kaons were identified subsequently by a cut on the coincidence time .",
    "a pilot experiment on the electro - production of kaons off a liquid hydrogen target was performed with an electron beam of 1.508gev energy in 2008 .",
    "the reaction can lead to two possible final states with either a @xmath3 or @xmath4 hyperon , which are easily separable by a missing mass analysis .",
    "the data was taken at two different kinematic settings in @xmath19 reactions with kaons in the momentum range of 400700mev@xmath1 and angular range of 2143@xmath7 .",
    "positive kaons were detected in  in coincidence with the scattered electron into spectrometer  b. the electron was identified by its minimum ionisation in the scintillators of spectrometer  b and a signal in the gas erenkov detector .",
    "the momentum transfer squared was @xmath0 0.050(gev@xmath1)@xmath2 , resp .",

    "such experiments are planned at mami for single @xmath3-hypernuclei in light targets  @xcite .",
    "the special kinematics for electro - production of hypernuclei requires the detection of both , the associated kaon and the scattered electron , at very forward laboratory angles which will be achieved by instrumenting the spectrometer in two arms , to either side of the main dipole .",
    "this implies that the electron beam must be steered through the spectrometer and a magnetic chicane comprising two compensating sector magnets is under development .",

    "a new coordinate detector has been developed for the electron arm  @xcite .",
    "it consists of two vertical planes of 18,432 fibres that will be supplemented by one or two horizontal planes .",
