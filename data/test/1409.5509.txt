    "we are concern with the following vlasov - type kinetic equation    [ eq : main ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents number density , and the binary interaction @xmath3 is non - local in space , which is expressed in the form @xmath4,\\quad",

    "in particular , it reveals the novel _ flocking phenomenon _ where agents , _ e.g. _ birds , fishes , organize into an ordered motion and flock into one cluster .",
    "a pioneering work on flocking dynamics is due to cucker and smale ( cs ) in @xcite , where they propose a symmetric interaction kernel @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is called _ influence function _ , which characterizes the influences between two agents .",
    "it is natural to assume that the strength of interaction is determined by the physical distance between agents : larger distance implies weaker influence .",
    "hence , we assume that @xmath9 is a bounded decreasing function on @xmath10 . without loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath11 throughout the paper .",
    "in particular , if @xmath8 decreases slow enough at infinity , namely @xmath12 cs system enjoys unconditionally flocking property : all agents tend to have the same asymptotic velocity , regardless of initial configurations , consult _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "another celebrated model is proposed by motsch and tadmor ( mt ) in @xcite , with interaction kernel @xmath13 with the new normalization by @xmath14 as opposed to @xmath15 in cs system , mt model performs better in the far - from - equilibrium scenario , consult @xcite and section [ sec : vs ] below .",
    "despite the fact that the interaction kernel is asymmetric , and momentum is not conserved , it is proved in @xcite that mt system has unconditional flocking property , under the same assumption on the influence function .    when number of agents @xmath15 becomes large , it is more convenient to study the associated kinetic mean - field representation , which is formally derived in @xcite . for cs and mt models ,",
    "the normalization factor @xmath16 takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total mass which is conserved in time .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study these two flocking models in kinetic level .",
    "our first result , stated in theorem [ thm : flocking ] , shows global existence of classical solution to the main system , as well as the long time behavior of the solution : unconditional flocking under assumption . for cs system ,",
    "the result is well - established in @xcite .",
    "we give an alternative proof for both cs and mt systems , employing the idea of @xcite in analogy with the agent - based models .",
    "similar argument can be made for hydrodynamic flocking models as well , consult @xcite .",
    "our second main result concerns with numerical implementation of system . despite being smooth for all finite time ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the solution is the formation of clusters , and in particular , flocking , under assumption .",
    "this implies concentrations in @xmath19 as time approaches infinity .",
    "such @xmath0-singularity is addressed in many systems , from finite - time concentration in aggregation systems _",
    "@xcite , to formation of @xmath0-shocks in euler equations _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    in particular",
    ", there are lots of development on numerical implementation of kinetic systems with singularities of different types .",
    "we refer readers to a recent review @xcite and references therein .",
    "many techniques use smooth approximations for the singularity .",
    "they suffer large errors as the solution becomes more and more singular .",
    "for instance , spectral method is widely used to solve kinetic systems .",
    "it is very accurate and efficient ( especially for our system as it has a convolution structure ) .",
    "however , when solution becomes singular , the method is unstable , due to gibbs phenomenon .",
    "we design a discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method to solve the flocking systems numerically .",
    "discontinuous galerkin methods are first introduced by reed and hill in @xcite and has many succesful applications in hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "the idea is to use piecewise polynomials to approximate the solution in the weak sense .",
    "the use of weak formulation of the solution overcomes the inaccuracy of the scheme .",
    "moreover , we prove in theorem [ thm : pp ] that our scheme is stable , under an appropriate limiter @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of dg method on @xmath0-singlarity has been studied in @xcite and more applications are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first prove flocking properties for the main system in section [ sec : flock ] .",
    "the numerical implementation for the system is developed in section [ sec : dg ] .",
    "we design dg schemes of second , third or higher in @xmath20 , and prove @xmath21-stability of the schemes .",
    "some examples are provided in section [ sec : example ] to demonstrate the good performance of our high order dg schemes , for capturing flocking , as well as clustering phenomena .",
    "in particular , we compare cs and mt setups under a far - from - equilibrium initial configuration .",
    "as addressed in @xcite , mt model has a better performance , in the sense of converging to the expected flock .",
    "to illustrate flocking in kinetic level , we first define the total variation in position @xmath22 and velocity @xmath20 : @xmath23    flocking can be represented using the following definition .",
    "there are two key aspects included : agents tend to have the same velocity as others , they wo nt go apart in large time .",
    "we say a solution @xmath24 converges to a flock in the kinetic level , if @xmath25 remains bounded in all time , and @xmath26 decays to 0 asymptotically , namely , @xmath27    we prove the flocking property of both cucker - smale and motsch - tadmor model in the kinetic level .    [",
