    "theoretical calculations show that , in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) should crystallize below a filling factor @xmath0@xcite .",
    "several experimental groups have reported transport measurements indicative of this electron crystallization when the filling factor of the lowest landau level is decreased below @xmath1 these measurements include the observation of a strong increase in the diagonal resistivity @xmath2 non - linear @xmath3 characteristics , and broadband noise .",
    "all these observations have been interpreted as the pinning and sliding of a wigner crystal ( wc)reviewexperimentwc . moreover",
    ", microwave absorption experiments@xcite have also detected a resonance in the real part of the longitudinal conductivity , @xmath4 , that has been attributed to the pinning mode of a disordered wigner crystal .",
    "the vanishing of the pinning mode resonance at some critical temperature @xmath5 has been used to derive the phase diagram of the crystal@xcite in the quantum regime where the kinetic energy is frozen by the quantizing magnetic field .",
    "similar microwave absorption experiments also showed a pinning resonance at higher filling factors close to @xmath6 where the formation of a wigner solid is expected in very clean sampleschen1,lewis1,lewis2 .",
    "finally , in landau levels of index @xmath7 , a study of the evolution of the pinning mode with filling factor reveals several transitions of the 2deg ground state from a wigner crystal at low @xmath8 to bubble crystals with increasing number of electrons per lattice site as @xmath8 is increased , and into a modulated stripe state ( or anisotropic wigner crystal ) near half filling@xcite .    in earlier works@xcite ,",
    "some of us have studied several crystalline states of the 2deg using a combination of hartree - fock ( hfa ) and generalized random - phase approximations ( grpa ) . in these works ,",
    "the energy and order parameters of the crystal were calculated in a self - consistent hfa while the collective excitations were derived from the poles of density response functions computed in the grpa . this microscopic approach",
    "( hfa + grpa ) works well at zero temperature but is difficult to generalize to consider finite temperature effects or to include quantum fluctuations beyond the grpa .",
    "finite - temperature or quantum fluctuations effects ( not already included in the grpa ) , are most easily computed by writing down an elastic action for the system . for a crystaline solid , this requires the knowledge of the dynamical matrix ( dm ) or , equivalently , of the elastic coefficients of the solid .",
    "a direct way to obtain these elastic coefficients is to compute the energy required for various static deformations of the crystal .",
    "using elasticity theory , each deformation energy @xmath9 can be written in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter characterizing the amplitude of the deformation and @xmath12 is generally a combination of elastic constants . in the limit @xmath13 , one can obtain the elastic coefficients by computing the deformation energy of one or more static deformations and using the known symmetry relations between the elastic constants .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain a dm from the grpa density response function much more directly without the need to compute the elastic coefficients @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the dm obtained from these two methods ( deformation energy and grpa ) in order to find the range of validity as well as the limitations of the gpra approach .",
    "we first consider the simple case of an isotropic ( triangular ) wigner crystal before tackling the more complex anisotropic wigner crystal @xcite or stripe phase that occurs near half - filling in the higher landau levels . we show that although the grpa method gives a good description of the qualitative behavior of the dm as a function of filling factor , its quantitative predictions must be used with caution .",
    "as we show below , an averaging procedure must be applied to the method in order to obtain a dm in the grpa that compares favorably with the one obtained by computing the deformation energy .",
