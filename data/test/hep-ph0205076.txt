    "we will do the combined analysis the various polarization asymmetries associated with both final state leptons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) within mssm . in the radiative dileptonic decay mode ( ) apart from lepton polarization we can also have polarized photon ( photon of a particular helicity ) .",

    "in radiative dileptonic decay mode of b - meson ( ) even the final state photon can emerge with a definite polarization .",

    "we have performed the numerical analysis of the forward - backward asymmetry and various polarization asymmetries whose analytical expressions are given in earlier sections .",
    "we are working under mssm , which is the simplest having the least number of parameters among the various extensions of the sm .",
    "but even the mssm has a very large number of parameters making it very difficult to do any reasonable phenomenology in such a large parameter space .",
    "we therefore focus on some unified models which reduce this large number of parameters to a manageable number .",
    "one of the most favorite such model is the supergravity ( sugra ) model . in sugra model in addition to the sm parameters we have : @xmath59 ( unified mass of all the scalars ) , m ( unified mass of all the gauginos ) , a ( unified trilinear couplings ) , @xmath60 ( ratio of the vev of the two higgs ) and @xmath61 as parameters ) which we are following is such that @xmath12 occurs in chargino mass matrix with positive sign ] .",
    "this sort of model is called minimal sugra ( msugra ) model .",
    "it has been well emphasized in many works @xcite that it is not necessary that all the scalars have a unified mass at gut scale . to suppress @xmath62 mixing its sufficient to have the universal mass to all the squarks .",
    "we will hence explore this type of sugra model also where the squarks and higgs sector has different universal mass . for the results shown in figures",
    "all the mssm parameters were evolved from gut scale to electroweak scale using suspect @xcite . for mssm parameter space analysis",
    "we have taken a 95% cl bound of @xcite : @xmath63 which is in agreement with cleo and aleph results .    in the sugra model",
    "where the condition of universality of the scalar masses has been relaxed we take the mass of pseudo - scalar higgs to be a parameter . in figure ( [ fig:1 ] )",
    "we have plotted the forward - backward asymmetry of the lepton in sm , msugra and sugra model . as we can see that both sugra and msugra gives fairly large deviation from the sm values specially when we have @xmath64 in the final states . in figures ( [ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] )",
    "we have plotted the longitudinal , transverse and normal polarization asymmetries respectively of @xmath1 . as we can see that all the three asymmetries shows fairly large deviation from their respective sm values .",
    "the deviation from the sm values is largely because of the new wilson coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these coefficients depends crucially on the two mssm parameters the higgs mass and @xmath60 .",
    "so for relatively large @xmath60 ( we have taken this to be 40 here in our calculations ) we can have very large variations in the polarization asymmetries .",
    "another important observation here is that in earlier model independent analysis of the b - meson decay modes like @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite the sum of longitudinal and normal polarization asymmetries ( of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) vanishes separately in sm .",
    "also the difference of the transverse polarization asymmetries of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "but here in the radiative dileptonic decay mode ( ) this hasnt happened .",
    "so that means that the results quoted in fukawe and aliev @xcite ( that these quantities identically vanish in sm ) was a process dependent statement . here in the process we are considering the @xmath67 ( which is non - zero in sm ) is behaving exactly like @xmath51 . as we can see from figures ( [ fig:5 ] , [ fig:7 ] ) that the sum of polarization asymmetries , of @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( for longitudinal and normal ) does nt vanish even within sm . from figure([fig:6 ] ) we can conclude that the difference of the transverse asymmetries also does nt vanish within sm .",
    "figure([fig:8 ] ) shows the photon polarization asymmetry for completenes .",
    "this is much more challenging experimentally to measure as compared to the @xmath68 polarization asymmetries .",
    "so the lepton polarization asymmetries ( as compared to photon one ) are the best places to look for physics beyond sm in fcnc semi - leptonic b - decays .      1 .   from the analysis of the fb - asymmetry , all the three polarization asymmetries associated with the final state leptons we can say that the deviation in these quantities from their respective sm values is fairly substantial almost over the whole region of dileptons invariant mass .",
    "2 .   as noted in earlier papers regarding general polarization asymmetries in various semi - leptonic decay modes of b - meson @xcite that the sum of the longitudinal and normal polarization asymmetries ( independently ) for lepton ( @xmath0 ) and anti - lepton ( @xmath1 ) vanishes in sm . similarly",
    "the difference of transverse polarization asymmetries of lepton ( @xmath0 ) and anti - lepton ( @xmath1 ) also vanishes in sm .",
    "but here in radiative dileptonic decay mode ( ) this is no - longer true . here",
    "the sum of the longitudinal polarization asymmetries of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in sm is very small ( not exactly zero ) for leptons to be muon ( see fig.([fig:5 ] ) ) and the deviation is fairly large in msugra and sugra model .",
    "the _ photon polarization asymmetry _ also shows a large variation from the respective sm value both for muons and tau but this measurement would be much more difficult experimentally .",
    "nonetheless this is still another kinematical variable which could be used to study radiative decays .",
    "4 .   as we can see that the variation of all the kinematical variables which we have analysed in our work shows large deviation from the respective sm values . but",
    "the deviation from the sm is much more enhanced in sugra model then in msugra model .",
    "the reason for this is the structure of the new wilson coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath69 .",
    "these coefficients depends on higgs mass ( in fact the dependence of these coefficients to higgs mass is inverse ) .",
    "so as the higgs mass increases the value of these coefficients decreases .",
    "in msugra framework where all the scalars have a common unified mass the higgs mass turn out to be very high ( and hence value of these coefficients small ) .",
    "whereas in sugra framework as the higgs sector has a different unification so the masses could be low ( and hence fairly large values of the new coefficients ) .",

    "<S> b - meson decays are very useful probes for testing the standard model and its various extensions . </S>",
    "<S> leptonic decays of b have very clean signatures in this respect and hence can be very useful testing grounds . in this work we study the effects of mssm ( minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model ) on various kinematical distributions in the radiative dileptonic decay ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the forward backward asymmetry ( of the lepton pair ) , and the various polarization asymmetries of both final state leptons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in radiative dileptonic decay of b - meson ( ) the final state photon can also be polarized . </S>",
    "<S> so in this channel one can also study the polarization effects of the final state photon . </S>"
