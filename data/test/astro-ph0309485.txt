    "recently , our knowledge on background cosmology has improved dramatically due to new supernovae and cosmic microwave background data .",
    "current observations favor a flat universe with @xmath13 ( see e.g. harun - or - rashid & roos 2001 ; krauss 2003 and references therein ) and the remaining contribution in the form of cosmological constant or some other form of dark energy .",
    "a class of models that satisfy these observational constraints has been proposed by caldwell , dave , & steinhardt ( 1998 ) where the cosmological constant is replaced with an energy component characterized by the equation of state @xmath14 .",
    "the component can cluster on largest scales and therefore affect the mass power spectrum ( ma et al .",
    "1999 ) and microwave background anisotropies ( doran et al . 2001",
    "; balbi et al . 2001 ; caldwell & doran 2003 ; caldwell et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a considerable effort has gone into attempts to put constraints on models with quintessence and presently the values of @xmath15 seem most feasible observationally ( wang et al .",
    "2000 ; huterer & turner 2001 ; jimenez 2003 ) .",
    "another direction of investigations is into the physical basis for the existence of such component with the oldest attempts going back to ratra & peebles ( 1988 ) .",
    "one of the promising models is based on so - called  tracker fields \" that display an attractor - like behaviour causing the energy density of quintessence to follow the radiation density in the radiation dominated era , but dominate over matter density after matter - radiation equality ( zlatev , wang , & steinhardt 1999 ; steinhardt , wang , & zlatev 1999 ) .",
    "it is still debated , however , how @xmath1 should depend on time , and whether its redshift dependence can be reliably determined observationally ( barger & marfatia 2001 ; maor , brustein , & steinhardt 2001 ; weller & albrecht 2001 ; jimenez 2003 ; majumdar & mohr 2003 ) .    from the gravitational instability point of view , the quintessence field and the cosmological constant play a very similar role : both can be treated as ( unclustered ) dark energy components that differ by their equation of state parameter , @xmath1 . technically , the equations governing the expansion of the universe and the growth of density perturbations in the two models differ only by the value of @xmath1 .",
    "given the growing popularity of models with quintessence , in this paper we generalize the description of the mass functions to include the effect of dark energy with constant @xmath1 .",
    "the mass function of clusters of galaxies has been used extensively to estimate cosmological parameters , especially @xmath5 and the rms density fluctuation @xmath6 , usually yielding ( due to degeneracy ) a constraint on some combination of the two .",
    "it has been shown that this degeneracy can be significantly decreased by using the data at different redshifts ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997a ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; bahcall & bode 2003 ) due to different growth rates of density fluctuations in different models .",
    "the growth rate also varies among models with different @xmath1 ; one may therefore hope to distinguish between them by analyzing mass function data at high redshift .",
    "it is worth noting that the power spectra of models differing only by @xmath1 are different only at very large scales , so the rms density fluctuations at scales of interest are almost identical when normalized to @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we briefly summarize the properties of the cosmological model with quintessence , including the linear growth factor of density fluctuations .",
    "section  3 presents the @xmath0-body simulations and the mass function measured from their output . in section  4 we describe the transformation between mass functions in terms of fof masses and in terms of abell masses .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the comparison of the theoretical mass functions to the data for clusters at different redshifts to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters .",

    "was run using a newer , publicly available version of tpm code which includes a number of improvements over the earlier code ( bode & ostriker 2003 ) .",
    "the changes in the code which would affect the numerical results include improvements in the time stepping ( adding individual particle time steps within trees , and a stricter time step criterion ) and domain decomposition ( adding an improved treatment of tidal forces , and a new selection criterion for regions of full force resolution ) . the changes in time step only affect the innermost cores of collapsed objects , where the relaxation time is short ( bode & ostriker 2003 ) , leaving the mass function unchanged .",
    "the changes in domain decomposition affect the mass function , but only at the low - mass end : in the @xmath2 and @xmath52 simulations , the mass function is complete only above @xmath57 ( 100 particles ) , while in the @xmath55 run it extends down to @xmath58 ( 16 particles ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the high - mass end of the mass function , where these numerical differences have no impact .",
    "the identification of halos in the final particle distribution has been performed with the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo - finding algorithm with the linking parameter @xmath59 ( particles are linked if their separation is smaller than @xmath60 times mean interparticle distance ) . as an alternative , we have also used the hop regrouping algorithm ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) .",
    "this procedure employs several parameters ; however , the resulting mass function is sensitive to only one of them , the density ( in units of the background density ) at the outer boundary of the halo , @xmath61 . as discussed by eisenstein & hut ( 1998 ) , assuming @xmath62 is equivalent to using the linking parameter of @xmath59 in the fof halo - finding algorithm .",

    "thus if the spectra are normalized to @xmath6 ( the rms density fluctuation smoothed with @xmath90 mpc ) , then there is no need to introduce the correction from @xmath91 to @xmath92 in ( [ q13 ] ) because it does not affect the calculation of @xmath72 .",

    "slightly overpredicts the number density of haloes ; a similar trend has been found recently by reed et al .",
    "therefore , we conclude that although originally designed on basis of other cosmological models , it can be considered valid also in the presence of quintessence .",

    "the masses of clusters of galaxies are usually measured as the so - called abell masses , i.e. the masses inside the abell radii of @xmath95 mpc . for the purpose of comparison with observations we need to transform the mass functions expressed in terms of the fof masses to abell masses .",
    "this can be done assuming a density distribution inside the cluster . since clusters are believed to be dominated by dark matter ( e.g. carlberg et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , although for smaller masses .",
    "since the nfw profile describes the halo properties in terms of the virial radius and the corresponding virial mass @xmath116 , we have to transform the fof masses first to virial masses .",
    "as previously noted , the fof parameter @xmath59 corresponds to the local overdensity at the border of the halo @xmath117 .",

    "<S> we use @xmath0-body simulations to measure mass functions in flat cosmological models with quintessence characterized by constant @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to the predictions of the formula proposed by jenkins et al . at different redshifts , in terms of fof masses as well as abell masses appropriate for direct comparison to observations . </S>",
    "<S> the formula reproduces quite well the mass functions of simulated haloes in models with quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cluster mass function data at a number of redshifts from carlberg et al . to constrain @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is obtained in the limit @xmath7 , but none of the values of @xmath1 in the considered range @xmath8 can actually be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> however , the adopted value of @xmath1 affects significantly the constraints in the @xmath9 plane . taking into account the dependence on @xmath1 we find @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 c.l . ) . </S>",
    "<S> since less negative @xmath1 push the confidence regions toward higher @xmath5 and lower @xmath6 we conclude that relaxing the assumption of @xmath2 typically made in such comparisons may resolve the discrepancy between recent cluster mass function results ( yielding rather low @xmath5 and high @xmath6 ) and most other estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that high @xmath1 values are preferred may however also point towards some unknown systematics in the data or the model with constant @xmath1 being inadequate .    </S>",
