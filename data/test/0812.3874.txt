    "supersymmetry  ( susy ) is a well - motivated extension of the standard model  ( sm ) that provides an explanation for the stability of the hierarchy between the weak scale and the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "however , experiment excludes susy from being an exact symmetry at low energies .",
    "if supersymmetry is _ softly _ broken , it is possible to push the superpartner masses up enough to make the theory consistent with experiment while still preserving the electroweak - gravity hierarchy . for this to work",
    ", the masses of the sm superpartners should not be significantly larger than the electroweak scale , putting them within reach of upcoming particle collider experiments such as the lhc .",
    "a major drawback of this scenario of softly - broken low - energy supersymmetry is that the supersymmetry breaking operators generically introduce many new sources of quark and lepton flavor mixing , leading to flavor - changing neutral currents  ( fcnc ) in conflict with experiment  @xcite .",
    "one way to cure this problem is to take no - scale boundary conditions in which the soft scalar masses and couplings all vanish at a boundary input scale , with the gaugino soft masses being the only significant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector at this scale  @xcite .",
    "such boundary conditions can arise from gaugino mediation  @xcite , or conformal running effects  @xcite .",
    "low - scale scalar soft terms , which are necessary to obtain a viable phenomenology , are generated primarily from the gaugino masses in the course of renormalization group  ( rg ) running from the boundary input scale down to near the electroweak scale .",
    "this dominant contribution is controlled by gauge interactions , implying that the regenerated scalar soft terms , and thus the squark and slepton masses , will be approximately flavor - universal at the low scale .",
    "a slight generalization of this pure no - scale picture , which still leads to scalar soft terms that are roughly flavor universal at the low scale ( for the first and second generations ) , is to allow non - vanishing higgs soft scalar masses at the boundary scale . in the context of gaugino mediation",
    "this can arise if the higgs multiplets propagate in the bulk  @xcite , while for conformal running , it can emerge from hidden - sector interactions related to the origin of the @xmath7 term  @xcite .",
    "these _ higgs exempt no - scale _  ( hens ) models often have an important phenomenological advantage over pure no - scale constructions : in large regions of the parameter space hens models have a neutralino lightest superpartner particle  ( lsp )  @xcite .",
    "this differs from the situation in strict no - scale models where typically the predominantly right - handed stau is the lightest sm superpartner particle  @xcite .",
    "while such models can be viable if the true lsp is a gravitino  @xcite , a neutralino lsp with exactly conserved @xmath8-parity tends to make for a better thermal dark matter candidate .",
    "hens models can push the right - handed stau mass above that of the lightest neutralino by the influence of the non - vanishing higgs soft masses on the rg running of the other soft parameters .",
    "the primary contribution to the slepton soft terms comes from the hypercharge @xmath9 term @xmath10 that appears in the rg equations for all the mssm scalar soft masses  @xcite .",
    "this contribution increases the right - handed slepton soft masses in the course of running down provided @xmath11 is negative . in the portion of the hens model parameter space that is also consistent with electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs scalar soft masses",
    "must typically be very tachyonic at the boundary scale to obtain a neutralino lsp , and the uncolored sfermions still end up being relatively light  @xcite",
    ".    while these hens models are compelling , the tachyonic higgs soft masses at the boundary scale lead to concerningly large tachyonic low - scale higgs soft masses .",
    "these , combined with the small ( but positive ) slepton soft masses , suggest that the true vacuum of the theory might be a charge - and - color - breaking  ( ccb ) minimum , or there may exist unbounded - from - below  ( ufb ) directions that are only stabilized far out in field space by higher - dimensional operators  @xcite .",
    "the presence of such features need not exclude these regions of the parameter space provided our sm electroweak vacuum is metastable and long - lived relative to the age of the universe .    in the present work we study the vacuum structure of hens models , and",
    "compute the lifetime of the sm vacuum state when it turns out to be metastable .",
    "we concentrate on the stability of the sm vacuum at zero temperature with respect to vacuum tunneling .",
    "thermal effects in the early universe can also potentially induce thermal transitions between different vacua , and modify the shape of the potential itself .",
    "however , these thermal effects tend to stabilize the origin of the field space to which the sm vacuum is connected , favoring this vacuum over others that lie further out in the field space  @xcite .",
    "thermal effects are especially effective in delaying the formation of vacua that break color due to the large thermal corrections from the strong gauge and top quark yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "scalar field evolution during and after inflation may also populate non - standard vacua , although the precise result depends on the details of inflation and lies beyond the scope of this paper  @xcite . by focusing solely on the @xmath12 constraints we obtain conservative and unambiguous bounds on the hens parameter space that do not depend on the cosmological history .",
    "motivated by gauge coupling unification , throughout this work we take the input scale to be @xmath13 and we assume a universal gaugino mass @xmath14 at this scale .",
    "the set of independent free parameters after imposing consistent electroweak symmetry breaking is therefore term is also free , but we fix it to be positive .",

    "as expected , our analytic tunneling solution shows that the bounce action increases with the size of the barrier .",
    "this solution also implies that the depth of the minimum to which one is tunneling to ceases to matter once it becomes very deep .",
    "thus , we can safely compute the rate to tunnel into a ufb-3 direction without knowing where it is ultimately stabilized provided the corresponding minimum is very deep relative to the height of the barrier .",
    "on the other hand , the relative depth of the minima is relevant to the tunneling rate when they are nearly degenerate , as can be seen from the analytic _ thin - wall _ approximate solution that can be safely applied in this case  @xcite .",
