    "string theory is a strong candidate for a unified theory including quantum gravity .",

    "the perturbative expansion generates random tetrahedral decompositions of three - dimensional objects . unlike the two - dimensional case , however , these objects are not always manifolds or not even pseudomanifolds .",

    "the second comment is on the manifoldness of a diagram @xmath6 .",

    "one can optimistically think that this represents membrane instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it may also happen that configurations of some specific topology entropically dominate in a critical region , although we have not fully evaluated the numerical coefficients in the free energy and their dependence on topology .",
    "another way to investigate the topologies of diagrams is to change the tensor @xmath112 to other forms .",
    "in fact , this change significantly modifies the dependence of the index function on the associative algebra @xmath0 .",
    "the change of @xmath112 and its effect on topological invariants will be studied in our future paper @xcite .    the second direction for further study is about the continuum limit .",
    "although we have not fully studied the continuum limit yet , and @xmath328 @xmath30 , since the dependence of @xmath148 and @xmath263 disappear from [ or ] .",
    "these values of coupling constants may correspond to a certain ( possibly uninteresting ) critical point because the models are not only diffeomorphism invariant but also weyl invariant .",
    "] there may be a chance to analytically solve the models in the large @xmath1 limit and to determine the critical behaviors , because the dynamical variables of our models are given by symmetric matrices @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "the third direction is about the introduction of matters to our models .",
    "we expect that extra degrees of freedom representing matter fields can be introduced by making copies of the variables @xmath329 and @xmath330 as in matrix models @xcite",
    ". it should be particularly interesting to introduce matter fields corresponding to the target space coordinates of embedded membranes and to study the critical behaviors .",
    "it would then be important to investigate if there is an analogue of the so - called `` @xmath331 barrier '' in the models and how the situation is modified when supersymmetry is introduced .",
    "we close this section with a brief comment on the relationship of our models with the colored tensor models .",
    "it is worth noting that our models ( with a color structure and an appropriate limit of parameters as in subsection [ tetrahedron ] ) generate _ all _ of the possible tetrahedral decompositions of three - dimensional manifolds , and thus should have more configurations than those of the colored tensor models .",
    "for example , the colored tensor models do not generate such tetrahedral decompositions where odd number of triangles are glued together along a hinge .",
    "since the colored tensor models introduce a pair of tensors as in two - matrix models , they may correspond to three - dimensional gravity with specific matters . in this sense",
    ", our models with minimum fine tunings may give a continuum theory ( if exists ) closer to pure gravity .",
    "it should be interesting to investigate whether colored tensor models can be obtained by adding some ( not necessarily unitary ) matters to our models .    in a remarkable paper @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the free energy of three - dimensional colored tensor models depend on the size of tensor , @xmath332 , as @xmath333 where we have suppressed other coupling constants .",
    "@xmath334 denotes a colored graph which is dual to a tetrahedral decomposition of three - dimensional pseudomanifold , and @xmath335 is the degree of @xmath334 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath332 limit , the leading contribution comes from colored graphs with @xmath336 .",
    "it is also shown that if @xmath336 then @xmath334 is dual to a three - sphere @xcite .",
    "therefore , the leading order graphs are homeomorphic to @xmath19 .",
    "we can say the same thing for our models if we confine our attention to only the diagrams that have tetrahedral decompositions dual to colored graphs .",
    "the degree @xmath185 of such a diagram can be evaluated as in @xcite and becomes @xmath337 with which the contribution to the free energy can be rewritten to the form @xmath338 thus , if we take a limit @xmath339 with @xmath340 kept finite , the leading contribution comes from configurations with @xmath341 , that is , tetrahedral decompositions of @xmath19 .",

    "<S> we propose a class of models which generate three - dimensional random volumes , where each configuration consists of triangles glued together along multiple hinges . </S>",
    "<S> the models have matrices as the dynamical variables and are characterized by semisimple associative algebras @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> although most of the diagrams represent configurations which are not manifolds , we show that the set of possible diagrams can be drastically reduced such that only ( and all of the ) three - dimensional manifolds with tetrahedral decompositions appear , by introducing a color structure and taking an appropriate large @xmath1 limit . we examine the analytic properties when @xmath0 is a matrix ring or a group ring , and show that the models with matrix ring have a novel strong - weak duality which interchanges the roles of triangles and hinges . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a brief comment on the relationship of our models with the colored tensor models .    </S>",
