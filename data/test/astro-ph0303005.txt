    "photoionization models for chemically homogeneous gaseous nebulae of constant density predict an almost constant temperature ; consequently , observers often assume a constant temperature to determine chemical abundances .",
    "the spatial temperature inhomogeneities in  regions are usually characterized by @xmath1 the mean square temperature variation in three dimensions .",
    "recent reviews on the temperature structure of gaseous nebulae are those by peimbert ( 1995 , 2002 ) , esteban ( 2002 ) , stasiska ( 2002 ) , liu ( 2002 ) , torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 2003 ) .    from uniform - density chemically - homogeneous photoionization models it has been found that @xmath1  is in the 0.002 to 0.025 range , for objects with solar or subsolar chemical abundances , with typical values around 0.005 ( e.g. , gruenwald & viegas 1992 , garnett 1992 ) .",
    "baldwin et al .",
    "( 1991 , henceforth b91 ) produced a photoionization model for the orion nebula , in which grains and gas are well mixed , that included photoelectric heating and cooling of the gas by grain ionization and grain collisions respectively ; for this model peimbert , storey , & torres - peimbert ( 1993 ) found that @xmath1  = 0.004 .    alternatively from observations of ngc 346 in the smc ( peimbert , peimbert , & ruiz 2000 ) , 30 doradus ( peimbert 2003 ) , and the orion nebula ( peimbert et al . 1993 , esteban et al .",
    "1998 , henceforth epte98 ) it has been found that @xmath1  is in the 0.02 to 0.04 range .",
    "the @xmath1values were derived by combining the temperature derived from the ratio of the  @xmath3 4363 , 5007 lines [ @xmath4 with the temperature derived from the ratio of the balmer continuum to @xmath5 [ @xmath6 and by combining @xmath7 with the temperatures derived from the ratio of @xmath8 5007 to the recombination lines of multiplet 1 of o  ii and the ratio of the of @xmath3 1906 , 1909 [ c  iii ] lines to the @xmath8 4267 c  ii recombination line .",
    "the differences between the observed @xmath1  values and those predicted by models have two profound implications for the study of ionized gaseous nebulae : they significantly affect the derived abundances and they imply the presence of one or several physical mechanisms not considered by the models .    to study this problem further we decided to obtain an independent measurement of @xmath1  based on over a million temperatures determined across the face of the orion nebula .",
    "the subarcsecond resolution of the hst makes it ideal for this purpose .",
    "each of these temperatures represents an average along a given line of sight . since the columnar temperatures already represent an average temperature it is not possible to obtain directly from them the full @xmath1  value .",
    "instead it is possible to obtain the mean square temperature variation across the plane of the sky and from this value it is possible to estimate @xmath1  .    in   2 we discuss the observations . in   3 and   4 we present the method for deriving the columnar temperature ( @xmath9 ) image together with its analysis . in ",
    "5 we formally define the columnar temperature , and the mean square temperature variation measured in the plane of the sky ( @xmath10 ) , then determine @xmath10  from the data .",
    "we then estimate @xmath1  based on @xmath10  and additional data from the @xmath9 image and  temperatures . in   6 we compare our results with those of previous work . a new model for the structure of the nebula near the ionization front",
    "is presented in  7 .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in ",
    "the intent of this observational program was to establish accurate  4363    and 5007    line ratios across the orion nebula using the wfpc2 camera ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and its narrow - band interference filters .",
    "this required imaging the nebula in the filters intended to isolate these lines ( f437n and f502n , respectively ) .",
    "since the extinction varies at small scales across the face of the nebula ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 ) , the magnitude of the extinction was determined on the same size scale as the  line observations .",
    "this required determination of the h@xmath11  and h@xmath12  line ratios , which demanded observations with the f656n and f487n filters .",
    "since the former filter allows some emission from the nearby doublet to contaminate the h@xmath11  signal , it was also necessary to observe with the f658n filter , which is dominated by the  6583    line .",
    "there was the possibility of the h@xmath13  line contaminating the f437n signal .",
    "the anticipation was that this could be handled by scaling from the h@xmath12  observations in f487n .",
    "each emission line filter also passes the nebular continuum radiation . in the case of the emission line signal being very strong",
    "as compared with the underlying continuum it is sufficient to measure the visual continuum with the f547 m filter and extrapolate to the wavelength of the emission line filter ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 , odell 1998a ) .",
    "however , the continuum of the orion nebula is quite strong ( odell &  hubbard 1965 , b91 ) because the large optical depth of dust particles lying just beyond the main ionization front ( mif ) back - scatter a significant fraction of the visual starlight reaching it .",
    "this back - scatter produces a continuum much stronger than that arising from atomic processes .",
    "the observations most sensitive to continuum contamination are those of the intrinsically weak 4363    line .",
    "fortunately , the f469n filter provided a good measure of the strength of the local continuum because it is free of strong emission lines when used to observe a low ionization object like the orion nebula .",
    "it is known that the he  ii 4686    line ( which the f469n filter was designed to isolate in high ionization objects ) is undetected in the orion nebula even in spectroscopic studies reaching nearly 10@xmath14 the intensity of h@xmath12  ( b91 , epte98 ) . combining the f547 m and f469n observations allowed a linear extrapolation or interpolation of the wavelength dependence of the continuum flux to the wavelength of each filter .",
    "the filters employed and their pre - launch characteristics ( wfpc2 instrument handbook , version 6.1 available at http://www.stsci.edu ) are summarized in table 1 .",
    "this table also gives the wfpc2+hst system throughput as recently determined in orbit .    because of the host of filters that had to be used and the length of the observing times necessary for producing an adequate signal in the fainter lines , only one field of view",
    "was covered .",
    "this was selected to include regions that had been spectroscopically studied recently using high dynamic range detectors ( b91 and epte98 ) , in order to allow a precise calibration of the filters , and to avoid the presence of the bright trapezium stars . as will be noted in   3.3 , the brightest trapezium star ( @xmath0  ori",
    "c ) was so close ( 7 ) to the ccd1 detector that low - level scattered light problems affected the long exposure images with that detector , rendering them useless for this program .",
    "the  image is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the four ccd detectors of the wfpc2 are numbered counter - clockwise , with the high - angular resolution , but smaller field of view , ccd being designated as ccd1 .",
    "all exposures were made with exactly the same pointing on 2002 january 21 , 22 , and 26 and at the same gain ( electrons / adu ) values .",
    "multiple exposures of the same duration were made with each filter in order to allow correction for cosmic ray induced events on the detectors . the individual exposure times and number of exposures were : f437n(1100 s , 6x ) , f469n(1100 s , 6x ) , f487n(350 s , 3x ) , f502n(160 s , 3x ) , f547m(230 s , 3x ) , f656n(140 s , 2x ) , f658n(200 , 2x ) .",
    "all images were `` on - the - fly '' calibrated by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) and then processed using their stsdas and the national optical astronomy observatories iraf tasks .",
    "the final product of the routine processing was a combined image such as shown in figure 1 .",
    "a considerable number of steps were necessary to convert the photometric observations with wfpc2 into  4363    and 5007    line ratios and from these line ratios into  values . in this section",
    "we first describe the method of calibration of the filter properties and other components of the photometric system and their application to obtaining line ratios .",
    "we then describe the method of correcting for interstellar reddening .",
    "finally , we derive the pixel by pixel values of  and estimate the statistical noise of the  values .",
    "the method of calibration adopted was identical to that employed by odell &  doi ( 1999 , henceforth od99 ) .",
    "however , in the present case we are only interested in the relative line fluxes , so that their equations for an absolute calibration can be simplified .",
    "the reader interested in absolute calibrations should refer to od99 , but note that an editing error occurs in their equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the term that reads @xmath15 should read @xmath16 , this error does not affect any of the numerical results in that paper .",
    "the basic approach is that one uses the wfpc2 observations of spectroscopically well studied regions to determine the calibration constants , which can then be applied to all the pixels of the image since the filter profile and system sensitivity does not vary across the image ( after the appropriate flat - field corrections have been applied ) .",
    "the most important calibration constants are determined directly from the observations of the reference regions and only the secondary constants draw on filter characteristics that were last determined before launch of the wfpcs .",
    "since the filter and detector characteristics can change with time , this method of calibration permits accurate determination of the most important characteristics .",
    "our method of deriving relative calibrations relates n@xmath17 ( the recorded number of adu counts per unit time ) to the characteristics of the source and the filter and camera system through the equation @xmath18 where we have used the following nomenclature : @xmath19=system throughput of the telescope - camera - detector system for a particular line ( excluding the filter ) @xmath20=transmission at a particular line of a filter @xmath21=surface brightness of a particular line in photons @xmath22 @xmath23=system throughput of the telescope - camera - detector system for the continuum ( excluding the filter ) @xmath24=effective width of the filter in  @xmath25=surface brightness of the continuum in photons @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to note that this calibration is done in units of the number of photons .",
    "when necessary , the resulting numbers can be converted to the relative flux . in this",
    "program multiple lines contributed to the signal from a single filter only in the case of f656n ( h@xmath11 - 6563   , -6548  +6583   ) and f658n ( -6583   , h@xmath11 - 6563   ) .",
    "we considered the contribution of h@xmath13  4340 to the f437n filter , but found it to be negligible .",
    "the reference regions were all taken from b91 .",
    "they observed with a long slit of east - west orientation located to the east of @xmath0  ori  c. the exact location was incorrectly expressed in b91 , but is correctly described in od99 .",
    "b91 gives line ratios and continuum to h@xmath12  ratios for 21 samples along their slit .",
    "we used the six samples that overlapped with the ccd4 portion of our images ( shown in figure 1 ) that included 4363    relative intensities .",
    "each sample was 2x 15.76  in size .",
    "the results of this calibration gave the following equations for the two important line ratios , h@xmath11/h@xmath12  and 4363/5007 .",
    "@xmath27}{(1 - 1.28\\frac{n_{469}}{n_{487}})},\\ ] ]    and @xmath28}{[1 - 1.62\\frac{n_{469}}{n_{502}}(33.4\\frac{n_{469}}{n_{547}}+0.423)]}.\\ ] ]    equation ( 2 ) uses a full - image average value for the color of the continuum and scales the continuum intensity from the closer continuum filter .",
    "equation ( 3 ) derives the color of the continuum at each pixel and then extrapolates or interpolates from the two continuum filters , this step being necessary as the continuum correction is quite important in the f437n measurements .",
    "the continuum typically contributes about 73%  of the total signal in the f437n filter .    in a similar investigation of planetary nebulae rubin et al .",
    "( 2002 , henceforth r2002 ) argued that there should be a small correction in the f437n filter for contamination in the blueward wing by h@xmath13  4340    emission .",
    "if one takes the pre - launch transmission profiles in the instrument handbook at face value , this would seem to be the case .",
    "however , it must be expected that the profiles of the filters change as they age in space .",
    "these changes are why we wanted to calibrate our observations within the data set .",
    "one would expect that the transmission near the principal lines to not change much with time , since they are located near the peak of the filters transmissions , whereas the h@xmath13  line falls far out on the wing of the filter curve .",
    "the instrument handbook indicates that the ccd sensitivities and throughput of the system have been remarkably constant .",
    "this combination of factors allowed us to empirically search for evidence of h@xmath13  contamination .",
    "we could determine the ratio @xmath29 with and without a correction for h@xmath13   contamination . with the correction the ratio was 0.42 and without the correction the ratio was 0.68 .",
    "the instrument handbook values indicate an expected value for the ratio of 0.62 .",
    "this indicates that the correction to the 4363    line surface brightness for h@xmath13  is about 10% .",
    "since the method of calibration essentially forces the calibration constants to be such as to give the right intensity ratios for the lines assumed to be present , this means that the effects of h@xmath13  correction will only enter in regions where the  line and the h@xmath13  line vary considerably in relative intensity .",
    "this is not the case for the area covered by the present images ( b91 , epte98 ) .",
    "the scatter of results from the six different samples in the calibration region indicates that the uncertainty of the balmer line ratios will be 7% , while that of the  line ratios will be about 12%",
    ". since the reddening corrections between 4363    and 5007    are small , the effects of the absolute uncertainty of the balmer line ratios are negligible .",
    "a 12%  systematic uncertainty of the  line ratios would make the derived  values be off systematically by @xmath30  k. this will not significantly affect our search for fine scale variations in . as we will see in   3.3 , there is excellent agreement between the electron temperatures derived in b91 and those derived in this study .",
    "the extinction corrections are based on determining the balmer line ratio for each pixel and then calculating the total extinction from comparison with the intrinsic ratio .",
    "this total extinction was then used to correct the  line ratios .",
    "we assumed with epte98 that the intrinsic balmer line flux ratio was 2.91 . using the same extinction law as epte98 means that the extinction corrected ( @xmath31 ) flux ratios",
    "could be calculated from the observed flux ratios ( @xmath32 ) by the relation @xmath33    the extinction values derived from the balmer line ratios are in good agreement with those of odell &  yusef - zadeh ( 2000 ) , this being the case for both their results obtained from radio continuum to h@xmath11  ratios and those obtained from their balmer line ratios .",
    "the  reddening corrected line ratios were then used to derive local values of .",
    "a convenient formulation of the relation of line ratio and  is given in r2002 .",
    "their equation ( 8) can be restated as    @xmath34    where we have restated the relation using the common - usage designation of the wavelengths in air ( rather than the more physically meaningful vacuum wavelengths employed by r2002 ) .",
    "since we are dealing with large numbers that are not usually determined to high precision , we sometimes will express   by the frequent nomenclature @xmath35@xmath36/10,000 .",
    "the resulting image is shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 shows multiple features .",
    "the most common are the `` scars '' that result from stars .",
    "these continuum sources are often saturated on some of the images used to derive .",
    "even when they are not saturated , the formal value of  at the star positions is subject to big uncertainties owing to the multiple subtractions that occur in the derivation .",
    "within ccd1 there are multiple features that are related to scattered light from @xmath0  ori  c  and the more westward members of the trapezium .",
    "any apparent fluctuation in  within ccd1 is suspect as being an artifact .",
    "there are a few features characterized by very low values of , which are discussed in   4.3 .",
    "this derivation gives for the six sample regions from the b91 study @xmath37@xmath35@xmath38=0.92@xmath390.01 , while values given in b91 for the same samples gives @xmath37@xmath35@xmath38=0.91@xmath390.02 .",
    "a comparison with the epte98 study is not possible because only their position 2 fell within a part of our image that was not useful as it fell within ccd1 and their position 1 was north of our field .",
    "it is important to assess the effect of the expected poisson noise on the determination of  because of the low signal level in some of the filters . in the region that was used for calibration the total number of recorded electrons ( 7 times",
    "the number of adu s recorded per pixel ) for the key filters were f437n(1260 ) , f469n(1260 ) , f547m(8400 ) , and f502n(10500 ) . in the following discussion",
    ", we ll assume that the root mean square deviation of a signal n is n@xmath40 .",
    "this is what we will mean as the probable error ( p.e . ) .",
    "we will assume that for multiplicative factors the p.e.s add quadratically .",
    "unfortunately , one can not determine the p.e . directly from the observations since the nebula is intrinsically variable in surface brightness .",
    "an assessment of the p.e . per pixel was done by creating noisy images ( using iraf task _ mknoise _ ) of the appropriate noise level for each of the observationally determined components of equation ( 3 ) , then determining the p.e . of the resulting image .",
    "the p.e . was 20% .",
    "in most of the following discussions we will assume this uncertainty .",
    "equation ( 5 ) was then used to determined the effect of uncertainties of the  line ratio on the derived value of . a 20%  photometric p.e .",
    "produces a p.e . in  of 5.7% . throughout this paper",
    "we will present uncertainties as probable errors ( p.e . ) calculated as the reciprocal of the root - mean square deviation of the recorded signal .",
    "the assumptions used in   3.1 for the derivation of eq .",
    "3 are not fully justified since there are two weak lines that affect the signal in the more important continuum filter , f469n .",
    "the  line appears at 4702   and the  line at 4713  , where the transmissions are 0.51 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "as we will demonstrate in this section , the effect of these lines is small in determination of  in the nebula .",
    "the presence of these weak lines will make the continuum at f469n appear brighter than it is .",
    "if we call the enhanced signal in the f469n n@xmath41 and the signal that would be observed if there were only continuum radiation n@xmath42 , then their ratio will be given by    @xmath43    the strength of the continuum is usually measured with respect to the h@xmath12  line at 4861  .",
    "this was done in b91 , where their figure 2 presents a quantity which is related to the equivalent width ( @xmath44 ) by @xmath8/@xmath44 .",
    "the average value of their plotted quantity is 9.5 , which gives an average @xmath44= 510  , which is in good agreement with earlier filter photometry over a wide range of the nebula ( odell &  hubbard 1965 ) which showed that @xmath44  is nearly constant in the inner region of the nebula , then decreases outward .",
    "having values of @xmath44  allows us to express the observed - quantity ratios of equation ( 6 ) as s@xmath45/s@xmath46=@xmath44s@xmath47/s@xmath48 and s@xmath49/s@xmath46=@xmath44s@xmath50/s@xmath48 .",
    "making this substitution and inserting the known values allows the restating of equation ( 6 ) as    @xmath51    if the ratio of line intensities with respect to h@xmath12  are constant across the region observed , then there is no net effect , since they will be constant in the calibration region and their affects will cancel out .",
    "however , if the line ratios vary , there will be an effect on the derived line ratios . anticipating that this effect is small , we address only the effect on equation ( 3 ) .",
    "since the correction term in the denominator of that equation is only about 0.015 , we can demonstrate adequately the effect of varying contaminating line strengths by considering only the terms in the numerator .",
    "if ( n@xmath41 / n@xmath42)@xmath52 is the value of the ratio of these quantities in the region used for calibration , we can express the local effect by multiplying the n@xmath53 rates by ( n@xmath41 / n@xmath42)/ ( n@xmath41 / n@xmath42)@xmath52 .",

    "epte98 found ratios of 0.00179 and 0.00645 for a region 45  north of @xmath0  ori  c  and 0.00186 and 0.00621 for a region25  south and 10  west of @xmath0  ori  c. these three samples would indicate values of n@xmath41 / n@xmath42 of 1.066 , 1.056 , and 1.055 respectively .",
    "the contaminating lines were not measured in b91 due to their lower spectra resolution .",
    "there is another set of data that provide even more information .",
    "co - authors antonio and manuel peimbert together with mara teresa ruiz obtained a long slit spectrum with the vlt3 telescope ( melipal ) and the fors1 spectrograph at the paranal observatory in chile on 2002 september 10 .",
    "the slit was oriented at a position angle of 340  and passed through the feature called hh  202-s in odell et al.1997 ( henceforth o97)and designated in figure 2 . to estimate the intensity of the  4702   line",

    "the average of a 2section , which is close to the east - west calibration samples from b91 , gave ratios relative to h@xmath12  of 0.0061 and 0.0060 for 4702 and 4713 respectively , giving a value of n@xmath41 / n@xmath59=1.0551 .",

    "our method of calculation of the line ratios assumed that the f469n filter was free of any emission lines , i.e. it was used as a measure of the continuum . in all of the nebula for which spectra exist",

    "together with a normal 4713 contribution , this would raise the ratio n@xmath41 / n@xmath42 to 1.18 , which would artificially reduce the 4363 ratio by a factor of 4.6 , and decrease the derived value of  to 6300 k. since the paranal sample on hh  202-s was 20  long and the object is much smaller , the contamination would be much larger on the object itself and the artificially derived  correspondingly lower .",
    "direct confirmation of contamination by 4702 was obtained by high velocity resolution spectra obtained by co - author odell and will henney with the manchester echelle spectrometer ( meaburn , et al .",
    "1984 ) on the 2.1-m telescope at san pedro martir observatory on 2002 october 23 , where one sees significant enhancement of that line , peaking at the optically brightest portion of hh  202-s , with no indication of 4686   emission .",
    "this means that enhanced  emission is a common feature of the anomalously low  spots seen in figure 2 , rendering useless the  values there .",
    "why  is enhanced in these shocks is in itself an interesting problem that should be addressed .",
    "several proplyds occur within our sample , the brightest within ccd2 - 4 are 141 - 301 and 182 - 413 .",
    "these proplyds and the fainter , less well resolved ones all show enhanced values of . in this case",

    "this means that in the local ionization fronts of the proplyds the 5007   emission is being suppressed by collisional de - excitation and the value derived from equation ( 5 ) will be an upper limit .",
    "this same interpretation is applied by r2003 to their high  for the proplyd 159 - 350 , which lies in the center of our ccd1 image and fell in their long slit spectrum . in their models of the proplyds close to @xmath0  ori  c  henney et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that the formal temperatures derived without consideration of collisional de - excitation would be about 20,000 k. if the densities of the more distant proplyds are much lower , as indicated by their surface brightnesses , then the effects of collisional de - excitation are less and some of the temperature increase we find is real .",
    "it is not clear if the similar local increase in  at the jet feature just south of the dark rim ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 ) in the southeast corner of ccd4 is due to this same effect .",

    "the analysis was done using stsdas tasks with iraf .",

    "the results are shown in figure 4 and figure 5 .",
    "these plots show that there is a large amount of power at the finest scales ( sub - arcsec ) but that power is found at all scales .",

    ", it becomes necessary to define the columnar temperature , , as @xmath79 where @xmath11 is the right ascension and @xmath80 is the declination of a given line of sight ( corresponding to a given pixel ) .",
    "then , the average temperature can be written as @xmath81 and the mean square temperature variation over the plane of the sky , @xmath10 , can be defined as : @xmath82    in table 2 we list a set of @xmath10(o@xmath68 ) values obtained from equation ( 13 ) and from the @xmath83 map presented in figure 2 . to determine @xmath10(o@xmath68 )",
    "we have excluded several features in order to diminish the noise of the samples : the pixels with very low flux , where we expect the temperature deviations to be mostly due to errors and not to physical inhomogeneities ; the shocks , where the destruction of dust could be enhancing the  4702 line and thus producing spurious temperatures ; the proplyds , whose density is not well represented by equation ( 5 ) ; the seams between the ccds , where there are border effects . keeping in mind these exclusions we defined the six regions from table 2 as follows : regions",

    "the differences in @xmath10  are real since they are larger than the expected observational errors .",
    "this could have 2 explanations : a ) region 3 is more homogeneous than regions 1 and 2 ; b ) another possibility is that @xmath1  is similar in the 3 regions , and the variations along each line of sight in region 3 are larger , while there are not so many variations along the lines of sight in regions 1 and 2 , thus giving a set of more homogeneous values of @xmath9 for region 3 than for regions 1 and 2 .",
    "we added most of the pixels from ccd2 , ccd3 , and ccd4 to generate region 4 .",
    "figure 6 presents a histogram of the 1.5 million temperatures included in region 4 .",
    "the mean square temperature deviation obtained from the histogram is @xmath86 ; which is not @xmath10 .",
    "it is not possible to derive directly @xmath10  from the histogram since each temperature has to be weighted by the corresponding emission measure ( see equation ( 13 ) ) . after weighting each  value for the emission measure",
    "we obtain a @xmath87 for region 4 .    we still have to subtract a value associated with the noise .",
    "the average p.e . in @xmath88 for the whole sample is 5.7 % , however this value is for an average pixel , while the measured @xmath89 gives more weight to the brightest pixels , the ones with the smaller errors . by considering that the average pixel is 1.89 times fainter than the average pixel weighted by emission measure , we expect the representative p.e . to be 4.2 % , which corresponds to an error on @xmath10  of 0.0017 , that is a @xmath90 .",
    "if we take out the noisiest parts of region 4 ( the outermost parts ) , we have region 5 . here the measured @xmath91 . for region 5",

    "we expect the @xmath10  result for region 5 to be more accurate ; however , by excluding the outermost parts we seem to be ignoring a fraction of the object which is intrinsically cooler .",
    "therefore we will adopt the value derived from region 4 , @xmath93 , as representative for the whole object .",
    "this value is similar to the one obtained by r2003 where they find @xmath94 values of 0.0095 , for their slit 1 , and 0.0104 , for their slit 2 .",
    "unfortunately , their slits 1 and 2 are located in our unusable ccd1 , which precludes a direct comparison .",
    "up to this point we have presented the results in terms of @xmath94(o@xmath68 ) , but what is of physical interest are the variations in three dimensions @xmath1(@xmath96 ) . in order to obtain the total @xmath1(@xmath96 ) value",
    "we need to consider the variations along the line of sight .",

    "the power included in @xmath98 increases in the presence of small scale inhomogeneities .",
    "this is because the many independent thermal elements along each line of sight will be masked in the averaging process , greatly reducing the total @xmath94 compared to @xmath95 .",

    "from the observations of peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1977 ) and epte98 it follows that @xmath13 decreases from about 0.85 near the center of the nebula to about 0.15 in the outer regions .",

    "the accepted model for the orion nebula is that of a blister .",
    "the visible nebula is the result of a thin layer of photoionized gas on the front of a giant molecular cloud , with a dense photon - dominated region ( pdr ) ( van der werf et al .",
    "1996 ) , also known ( young owl et al .",
    "2000 ) as a photodissociation region , on the neutral side of the ionization front .",
    "gas is accelerated away from this ionization .",
    "the dominant ionizing star is @xmath0  ori  c   which lies at about 0.25 pc in front of the ionization front . in the foreground",
    "is an irregular veil of neutral material that produces most of the extinction ( odell 2002 ) .",
    "this model is reviewed in detail in a recent review article ( odell 2001b , henceforth od2001 .",
    "the basic physics is discussed in a review paper by ferland ( 2001 ) .",
    "the shape of the ionization front has been derived ( wen &  odell 1995 , henceforth wo95 ) using a basic process originally proposed by gary ferland in b91 .",
    "this draws on the fact that at a substellar point , the surface brightness in a recombination line ( for example h@xmath11 ) is directly proportional to the local flux of ionizing photons .",
    "wo95 solved the more general problem , where the line of sight to a point in the nebula does not pass through the ionizing star .",
    "they showed that the ionization front is an irregular concave form , with an escarpment that explains the bright bar feature running near @xmath61  ori  a  and has a dominant hill to the southwest of @xmath0  ori  c , where the orion - s radio and infrared sources are located .",
    "odell &  doi ( 2003 ) have shown that the latter region is the source of multiple optical and radio outflows and probably contains a secondary source of star formation .",
    "this model was derived using a resolution of 2 .",
    "because of the progressive nature of the calculation of the shape of the surface , it is most accurate near the direction of @xmath0  ori  c.    the only diagnostics that we have along the line of sight into the nebula are the increasingly blue - shifted emission from the higher ionization states that are found further from the mif and forbidden line doublet intensities that indicate a decreasing density with increasing distance from the mif ( od2001 ) .",
    "these few tests that we have are consistent with the model .",
    "a detailed hydrodynamic model of the orion nebula has not been calculated , however , it is expected that the high density in the pdr region is the result of a shock moving into the molecular cloud and that the ionization front is slowly progressing into the neutral region .",
    "the hst images of the orion nebula are filled with detail , especially in the inner regions . at first blush",
    ", this appears to present a fundamental quandary if the standard model for the nebula is correct .",
    "one can derive a formal thickness ( l ) for the ionized layer , using the assumption that the density is constant and knowing the emissivity in the recombination line being observed .",
    "wo95 show that this value is characteristically about 0.13 pc for the central part of the nebula , which corresponds to an angle of 58  if the distance to the nebula is 460 pc ( bally , odell , &  mccaughrean 2000 ) .",
    "they also show that if the density has an exponential decrease , its scale - height will be l/2 ( 29 ) and the emissivity would decrease with a scale - height of l/4 ( 15 ) .",
    "this means that in the standard model one should not be able to see variations in the structure of the nebula with size scales smaller than about 15 .",
    "one certainly see lots of fine - scale ( less than 15 ) structure in ground - based and hst images . some of this can be attributed to variations in the amount of extinction ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 )",
    ", most of which is caused by the foreground neutral veil of material ( od2001 ) .",
    "however , the extinction corrected images in h@xmath11  show significant structure right down to the limit of the extinction corrections , which was about 1.7 .",
    "this is shown in figure 7 , which is a profile of the extinction corrected h@xmath11  image of the nebula ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 ) derived with a resolution of 1.7  and taken across the velocity sample region designated in figure 1 .",
    "there are even smaller features , which appear to be a continuation of the structure , as shown in the hst images , while the smallest features are due to the outflows from young stellar objects and the shocks they create in the low density ambient gas ( odell &  doi 2003 , od2001 ) and are seen in the hst images to be sub - arcsecond in extent .",
    "the presence of fine scale structure associated with the main emitting layer of ionized gas presents a fundamental challenge to the accepted model of the nebula .",
    "the structure is there , for we see it , but if the ionized gas was simply a smooth flow of gas away from a homogeneous ionization front , we should not see any small scale structure .",
    "we demonstrate in   7.5 and   7.6 ,",
    "that the resolution of the quandary lies in the emitting layer having a much more complex structure than assumed in published models .",
    "there are two additional lines of evidence indicating that small scale structure exists within the ionized layer , these being the structure seen in the velocities and fine scale variations in the ionization .",
    "both argue for structure down to at least a few arcseconds .",
    "the internal velocities within the orion nebula have been the subject of investigation for nearly a century , beginning with a fabry - perot study by fabry ( buisson , fabry , &  bourget 1914 ) , an extensive mapping using photographic detectors ( wilson et al .",

    "a more ambitious and complete mapping of the radial velocities is now being created as part of the rice university phd thesis of takao doi , who is creating velocity images of the huygens region at resolutions of 10 km  s@xmath145  and 2  in the h@xmath11 ,  5007  , and 6583   lines , and a similar study at the instituto de astronoma , unam , morelia , mxico in the red  doublet lines by w. j. henney &  m. t. garca - daz that uses in part data obtained by co - author odell .    with the permission of our colleagues we have used their north - south orientation",
    "slits to create figure 8 and figure 9 .",
    "these are spectra taken from the velocity sample region indicated in figure 1 and used for the creation of the surface brightness profiles of figure 7 .",
    "the instrumental full width at half maximum intensity ( fwhm ) was very close to 10 km  s@xmath145  in each case . although the original samples along the slit were at intervals of 0.64 , the seeing was characteristically about 2  during the observations .",
    "the former figure shows a half tone depiction of the spectra in lines characterizing various parts of the ionized layer and the latter presents contour diagrams of the same data .",
    "the power of this approach lies in the fact that various emission lines are characteristic of different samples of the ionized layer .",
    "although this fact is implicit in the discussion of several texts , perhaps the best illustration is in a discussion of structure of the helix nebula ( odell 1998b ) .",
    "emission comes from throughout the ionized layer , its emissivity being weighted towards the lower  regions along the line of sight .",
    "the forbidden line emissivity in , , and  are all weighted towards the higher  regions along the same line of sight .",
    "delineation of information about structure along the line of sight is also provided by the ionization differences .",
    "emission will arise exactly in the ionization front , where ionization of hydrogen rapidly transitions from nearly unity to nearly zero .",
    "a good fraction of the  emission will occur in the adjacent thin +  zone , while the  emission will arise in the outermost ( closest to the observer ) +  zone .",
    "we see in figure 8 and figure 9 that there is considerable velocity variation along the slit and that the velocity in one ion is not well correlated with that in the other ions .",
    "thermal broadening of the h@xmath11  line precludes a detailed analysis of its velocity structure , but is low enough in the other , more massive , ions to see the differences clearly .",
    "one sees that the narrower the expected emitting region , the more structure there is along the slit .",
    "emission gives evidence for velocity structure with a scale of the seeing values of 2  and  emission has a characteristic size scale down to about 5 .",
    "these data argue that structure exists within the main ionized layer at sizes down to at least 2  and that gas of different states of ionization is moving at different velocities .",
    "it is the spatially unresolved average velocity along the slits which give the characteristic progression to more blueshifted radial velocities at higher states of ionization that is the earmark of a thin blister of gas expanding towards the observer .",
    "the second line of evidence for fine scale structure within the nebula is from comparison of emission from very different states of ionization or conditions of emissivity .",
    "for this comparison we used two pairs of images , whose closeness in wavelength essentially eliminate the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "the first pair used the f487n images , which are primarily due to h@xmath12  emission whose emissivity is like that of h@xmath11  in that it selectively comes from the lower  regions , and the f502n images , which are primarily emission from  5007   high  collisionally excited regions .",
    "the second pair used the f656n h@xmath11  filter and the  f658n filter .",
    "the considerations for the emissivity are similar in the second pair of filters , but the emitting layer of the  emission should be thinner .",
    "the hydrogen emission arises from throughout the ionized zone , but the  and  emission arise from selected zones , as described earlier in this section .",
    "the results of these comparisons are shown pictorially in figure 10 .",
    "one sees that there are wide variations in these ratios .",
    "some of these changes are due to shocks caused by outflows from pre - main sequence stars ( odell &  doi 2003 ) while others such as the bright bar region in the southwest corner of the images is due to large scale topographic features of the ionization front ( odell &  yusef - zadeh 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to these , there are many additional features .",
    "a more quantitative depiction is shown in figure 11 and figure 12 , where profiles along the same region as the velocity samples are presented .",
    "we see fine scale structure in the ratios down to nearly the size of the 1x2  bins over which the data was averaged , although a characteristic value would be 3  to 4 .",
    "the probable errors of the ratios were derived from the total counts used in their calculation and are 1.8 %  for the f658n / f656n ratio and 1.2 %  for the f502n / f487n ratio .",
    "as expected , the peaks are sharper in the f658n / f656n ratio , indicating that the sources are small concentrated regions .",
    "the fact that there is a general anti - correlation of the ratios indicates that the variations are largely due to ionization structure , rather than temperature differences .    in summary",
    ", we can say that both the spatially resolved high resolution velocity data and the line ratio data indicate structure in the main ionized layer of 3  to 5 .",
    "a comparison with a profile of the results of the determination of  is also useful and is shown in figure 13 , where a profile along the same region as the velocity data is shown .",
    "we see that the proplyd 141 - 301 shows the common characteristic of the other proplyds , in having a higher than normal formal value of @xmath35 , but , as shown in   4.3 ,",
    "this is probably due to collisional de - excitation of the electron state giving rise to the 5007   emission .",
    "the `` jet '' feature shows a similar enhancement , which may also be due to having densities comparable to the critical density for this nebular transition , but it could be real , being the result of shock heating at the interface with the ambient nebular gas . aside from these features , there are variations in  all along the slit . in the well exposed region from 50  to 150  we calculate that the probable error of  is 0.5% i.e. 45 k. , which is small as compared with the observed variations .",
    "there are no obvious general patterns of changes with the extinction corrected surface brightness in h@xmath11 , the velocity changes , nor the line ratios .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the pdr behind the ionization front of the orion nebula is very clumpy ( tauber , goldsmith , &  dickman 1991 , hogerheijde , jansen , &  van dishoeck 1995 ) .",
    "hcn and hco@xmath69 observations by young owl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) demand that the portion of the pdr seen obliquely behind the bright bar feature possesses dense clumps ( 3 x 10@xmath146 @xmath66 ) embedded within an interclump medium of lower density ( 5 x 10@xmath147 @xmath66 ) .",
    "more direct observations come from imaging in h@xmath148 .",
    "van der werf et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that clumps exist from a scale of 40  down to their resolution limit of 1.5 .",
    "the highest angular resolution study in h@xmath148  is that of vannier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who studied a region northwest of @xmath0  ori  c  at a resolution of 0.15 .",
    "again , they saw clumpy structure , in this case going down to 1.5 - 2.0 .",
    "a clumpy structure in the pdr is not unexpected and there would be several instability mechanisms that operate there ( capriotti 1973 , brand 1981 , vishniac 1994 , garca - segura &  franco 1996 , williams 1999 ) .",
    "the implications of these clumps for the nature of the ionized layer of gas in the nebula are very important since it is into these clumps and the interclump medium that the ionization front advances . where the density is lower",
    ", the advance will be more rapid .",
    "the expected rate of advance of the ionization front is not known as the hydrodynamic problem has not been solved .",
    "the orion nebula is old enough that it is in a state of quasi - equilibrium and the velocity will depend on many factors , including whether or not the photoionizing star @xmath0  ori  c  has a velocity component towards or away from the molecular cloud .",
    "this means that one would expect the ionization front advancing into a clumpy pdr to move beyond the dense clumps and be retarded at the clumps , so that a microscopic view of the ionization front would be like that of a stubble - field .",
    "the region behind a dense knot would then be shadowed from ionizing lyman continuum ( ) radiation coming directly from @xmath0  ori  c  and would be illuminated only by diffuse ( sometimes called scattered )  photons . where the density is insufficient to form a quasi - static ionization front , the clumps will simply retard the advance of the ionization front , while the dense clumps will form a small local ionization front that will exist until it has lost sufficient material through photoevaporation that the ionization front can penetrate , then totally disperse it .",
    "the shadowed regions behind the knots within the ionized layer can be sources of low temperature emission and of temperature variations , therefore they will increase the @xmath1  value .",
    "the photoionization equilibrium in such a shadowed region was considered 30 years ago ( van blerkom &  arny 1972 , kirkpatrick , 1972 , capriotti 1973 ) , but it is only recently that the more general case has been considered ( cant et al .",
    "1998 , henceforth c98 ) .",
    "the region illuminated only by diffuse lyc will see a lower temperature radiation field because most of the recombinations of  that produce the diffuse lyc will result in a photon just above the ionization threshold , while the direct stellar field will have more high energy photons and produce higher  regions .",
    "c98 have solved the general problem , rather than trying to apply their calculations to only a specific object , including the role of ambient gas density and the time variability of the shadowed zone structure .",
    "when the combination of the stellar radiation density ( the diffuse radiation field density is about 15 %  of that ) and gas density is right an ionization front can form immediately at the edge of the shadowed cylinder of gas .",
    "as the radiation density increases and/or the density decreases , the ionization front can form within the shadowed cylinder and even produce a condition where the shadowed cylinder is completely photoionized .",
    "c98 argue that  within the ionized shadow zone will be about 6000 k , considerably cooler than that of the directly illuminated gas .",
    "the radiation from the shadowed zone can be seen by the distant observer for two reasons . in some cases the angle between the line of sight from the observer to @xmath0  ori",
    "c  can be quite different from the angle between @xmath0  ori  c  and a local spot on the ionization front , allowing direct view of the shadowed region .",
    "even when that is not the case , a significant fraction of the radiation from the shadowed region will be scattered by dust in the nearby pdr , in the same way that radiation from the ionized layer is scattered and produces the observed redward asymmetry of the emission lines ( odell , walter , &  dufour 1992 , henney 1998 ) .",
    "shadowed regions have already been detected in the orion nebula . in a study of both the cometary knots in the helix nebula and",
    "the proplyds in the orion nebula , odell ( 2000 ) showed that the proplyds cast ionization shadows as long as 0.2 pc .",
    "the proplyds are optically thick to lyc radiation ( odell 1998a ) and in that sense resemble the optically thick clumps we argue exist at the main ionization front of the nebula .",
    "the proplyd ionization shadows are most visible when the geometry is such that the shadow falls into the ionized layer that provides most of the radiation identified as the nebula .",
    "odell ( 1998a ) showed that the shadows of the proplyds covered about 0.5%  of the view from @xmath0  ori  c. by assuming : pressure equilibrium , @xmath149 , @xmath150(n@xmath70 ) = 10,100 k ( b91 , epte98 , r2003 ) for the directly illuminated regions , and @xmath150(n@xmath70 ) = 6,000 k ( c98 ) for the shadowed regions we obtain a contribution of 0.0093 to @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) ( see equation ( 10 ) ) , that is a contribution of 0.0043 to the total @xmath1  ( due to second term of equation ( 19 ) ) . to reach the estimated 0.011 contribution to @xmath1  due to the o@xmath70 zone",
    ", we need an additional 0.7% of the volume of the nebula to be in a different type of ionized shadowed region .",
    "in what follows we will propose the presence of high density clumps inside the ionized layer left behind by the advancing ionization front . in the model we propose ( illustrated in cartoon form in figure 14 ) the clumps would not be permanent , rather , they would exist in the ionized layer only until they are destroyed by photoevaporation .",
    "the cool columns of gas behind them would then come to the higher equilibrium  appropriate for illumination by @xmath0  ori  c  rather than diffuse lyc .",
    "one can approximate the results of an ionization front advancing into a clumpy pdr , as described in   7.4 .",
    "we dont know the velocity of this advance .",
    "it must be small , because the tracers of the ionization front ( [ o  ii ] and [ s  ii ] ) are blueshifted 2.5 km  s@xmath145  with respect to the pdr tracers ( co , c  ii ) ( odell 2001a ) .",
    "this blueshift is probably due to the hot gas tracers coming from a layer that has already been accelerated by the pressure gradient , rather than being the result of @xmath0  ori  c  moving away from the pdr .",
    "the radial velocity of @xmath0  ori  c   is highly uncertain because of variability probably arising in the extended atmosphere of the star .",
    "it is unlikely that this star is moving at a high velocity with respect to the other cluster stars and their velocity is the same as the pdr ( odell 2001a ) within the uncertainty of 3 km  s@xmath145 . in the discussion below",
    "we will assume that the ionization front is advancing into the pdr at a rate of 2 km  s@xmath145 , but it should be recognized that this could be off by a factor of two . in ",
    "7.5 we showed that the fluctuations in the surface brightness of the nebula indicate structure with a height of about 0.025 pc .",
    "this would mean that the characteristic clump will have been illuminated by lyc radiation for about 1.3x10@xmath147 years , which we will call the kinematic age .",
    "if we can determine the column density and rate of loss of atoms per unit time and area , we can calculate the time that the clumps can survive photoevaporation and have a check on our basic model .",
    "if the clump diameters are about 0.0044 pc ( corresponding to 2 ) and the densities are 3x10@xmath146 @xmath66  ( young owl et al .",
    "2000 ) the average column density of a clump would be 2.8x10@xmath151 atoms @xmath152 .",
    "the corresponding mass would then be about 7x10@xmath153 g )",
    ".    the photoevaporation rate for these clumps will be very similar to those of the proplyds , which henney et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown to be 8x10@xmath154 m@xmath155  yr@xmath145 .",
    "since these objects are comparable in size to the clumps at the ionization front , their average rate of loss of atoms is relevant , this being 2x10@xmath156 atoms @xmath152  s@xmath145 . in this case",
    ", the lifetime of the clumps would be about 5,000 yrs .",
    "however , the proplyd measured by henney et al .",
    "( 2002 ) must be much closer to @xmath0  ori  c  than the ionization front , so that the rate of loss has been overestimated and the survival age of the clumps underestimated .",
    "this means that the survival age of the clumps and their kinematic ages are compatible .",
    "they are , however , close enough that the process involved must be a dynamic one , with any one clump surviving for only about 10@xmath147 years , but the number of clumps present at any time would be about constant as new clumps are revealed by the advancing ionization front .",
    "we can estimate the effect of these shadowed regions if we know their emissivities and volumes .",
    "if the shadowed regions exist long enough that dynamical equilibrium is established with their surroundings ( c98 ) , then their volume emissivity will be four times that of the ambient lower density and higher  gas . if pressure equilibrium is not established , then the emissivity increase will be about two times that of the ambient gas .",
    "if one interprets the non - jet fluctuations in the extinction corrected h@xmath11  surface brightness ( figure 7 ) as being due to knots at various distances from @xmath0  ori  c , then they lie in a range of about 0.025 pc or 11 , which is comparable to the emissivity scale - height of 15  derived in   7.2 .",
    "this means that the shadowed regions occur within the zone where most of the emission occurs .    to calculate the contribution to @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) and @xmath1",
    "due to the shadows behind these clumps we need an estimate of the fraction of the emission produced in the shadowed regions .",
    "assuming : a ) the typical clump density to be @xmath157 @xmath66  , b ) the average density of the ionized media to be @xmath158 @xmath66  , and c ) that half of the ionized matter originated from the photoevaporation of these clumps , it follows that the volume originally occupied by the clumps must be about 1/1200 of the total volume .",
    "however , the shadowed volume is larger than the volume occupied by the clumps ; we know that the shadows are approximately 0.025 pc long , while each clump is approximately 0.0044 pc across , so the shadowed volume can amount to approximately 1/200 of the volume of the region closest to the main ionization front , before these clumps are photoevaporated . since these clumps survive long enough to cast 0.025 pc shadows , and the emissivity scale - height of the orion nebula is of 0.034 pc the total volume of the shadowed regions is about 1/250 of the effective emitting volume .",
    "there are three possible physical conditions in the shadowed regions : a ) that they are completely neutral , in this case they will not contribute to @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) nor to @xmath1 ; b ) that they are completely ionized , but not in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , then their contribution to @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) would be about 0.0038 and to @xmath1  of about 0.0016 ; and c ) that they are completely ionized and in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , then their contribution to @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) would be about 0.0075 and to @xmath1of about 0.0032 .",
    "the contribution of the shadows , including the shadows of the clumps and of the proplyds , amounts to @xmath159 , that corresponds to @xmath160 . note that in the shadowed regions oxygen is either neutral or once ionized , and that therefore the shadowed regions do not contribute to the @xmath1(o@xmath68 ) value",
    "it can be shown that the ionized part of the proposed clumps has a very small effect on @xmath1 .",
    "the clumps are expected to be close to the pdr , and their ionized part will have a larger density than the interclump medium , so we expect the oxygen in the ionized fraction of the clumps to be singly ionized .",
    "additionally the clumps cover a total solid angle of about 0.03 steroradians , and therefore absorb less than 1/400 of the ionizing photons , about 1/800 .",
    "this implies that their emissivity amounts to about 1/800 of the total emissivity of the nebula and that the physical conditions in the high density photoevaporated region will produce a negligible effect in the increase of @xmath1(o@xmath70 ) or @xmath1 .",
    "there is an unexplained component of line broadening in the orion nebula that may be explained by the clumpy model for the ionized layer that we propose .",
    "this anomaly first surfaced with castaeda s ( 1988 ) study of , and remained with the inclusion of other massive ions ( , jones 1992 ; , odell &  wen 1992 ; , wen &  odell 1993 ) .",
    "after quadratic subtraction of the instrumental , thermal , and turbulent components of broadening , there remains a large and unexplained line width having fwhm@xmath6410 km  s@xmath145 .",
    "the large thermal width of the  lines makes it difficult to accurately determine the extra width there , however , wilson , et al.s ( 1997 ) study of the h64@xmath11 line indicates an unexplained broadening component ( called the turbulent velocity in their paper ) of 19.6@xmath390.9 km  s@xmath145 .",
    "this extra broadening component has been re - addressed using spectra made with the keck telescope for the study of proplyds and their jets ( henney &  odell 1999 , bally , odell , &  mccaughrean 2000 .",

    "the longer keck slit spectra were subjected to a separate analysis using various fractions of the total slit length and no variation of the results were seen , i.e. there was not a relation between sample size and the residual line width . the radio ( h64@xmath11 , 19.6@xmath390.9 ) and optical ( h@xmath11 , 20.9@xmath391.3 and h@xmath12 , 18.8@xmath392.2 ) are in agreement within their individual uncertainties .",
    "the unexplained broadening in the emission lines that arise from the lower temperature component of the nebula is twice that of lines arising from the higher temperature component .",
    "we see that the recombination lines of h  i and he  i that preferentially come from cool regions have a clearly larger unexplained width ( average 19.4 km  s@xmath145 ) than the collisionally excited forbidden lines that preferentially come from hot regions ( average 10.9 km  s@xmath145 ) .",
    "this strongly argues against the broadening arising from alvn waves ( od2001 ) since they would have little dependence upon .",
    "the explanation certainly does not lie with there being a systematic difference in , because the sense of the correlation is opposite to that expected .",
    "the clearcut differences in the extra broadening in collisional and recombination lines is probably related to the the mechanism giving rise to the temperature inhomogeneities .",
    "can the broadening be due to the clumpy structure that we argue can explain the temperature inhomogeneities ?",
    "odell &  wen ( 1992 ) argue that clumps having sizes of less than 2.3  could produce the extra broadening , but this argument was made before knowledge of the larger broadening of the hydrogen lines",
    ". the steady process of destruction of the clumps by photoevaporation would certainly give rise to flows away from the clumps .",
    "however , the line broadening due to this should selectively be a blueward distortion of the integrated line - of - sight line profile , except for the final stage of destruction , when material would be flowing in all directions .",
    "however , the initial phase of a shadowed region would be accompanied by material flowing inward towards the low pressure zone that would exist when the shadowed  drops and the shadowed region is moving towards a state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
