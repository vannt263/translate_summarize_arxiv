    "two - dimensional frustrated xy models @xcite , in which vortices form a dense incommensurate lattice , have attracted considerable interest as a possible two - dimensional vortex glass without quenched disorder @xcite or a structural glass of supercooled liquids @xcite . in superconducting systems with pinning described by xy models",
    ", frustration can be introduced by applying an external magnetic field as in periodic arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , superconducting wire networks @xcite and superconducting thin films with a periodic pattern of nanoholes @xcite .",
    "the frustration parameter @xmath2 sets the average density of vortices in the lattice of pinning centers and can be tuned by varying the strength of the external field @xcite .",
    "depending on the structure of the lattice of pinning centers and the value of @xmath2 , a commensurate vortex lattice is favored in the ground state , which leads to discrete symmetries in addition to the continuous symmetry of the phase variables characterizing the superconducting order parameter . in this case , the phase transitions and resistive behavior of the system are reasonably well understood for simple low - order commensurate phases such as @xmath3 , on a square lattice @xcite , and @xmath4 , on a triangular lattice @xcite of pinning centers . however ,",
    "when the vortex lattice is incommensurate with the pinning centers , both the nature of the equilibrium phase transition and of the low - temperature state in the thermodynamic limit is less clear .",
    "this is the case of josephson - junction arrays @xcite and superconducting wire networks @xcite on a square lattice , described by the frustrated xy model with irrational @xmath2 , which has been extensively studied by various methods @xcite .",
    "another interesting physical realization but much less investigated so far , should occur in josephson - junction arrays and superconducting wire networks @xcite on a honeycomb lattice , and superconducting films with a triangular pattern of nanoholes @xcite , which can be described by the fully frustrated xy model ( @xmath3 ) on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "in early monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite , a phase transition at a nonzero temperature in the koterlitz - thouless universality class was suggested , based on the saturation of the specific - heat peak with increasing system sizes and the apparent jump in the helicity modulus . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations of the the spin - glass order parameter by mc simulations @xcite suggested that , instead of an order - disorder transition , a spin - glass transition should take place approximately at the same temperature .",
    "in contrast , from mc simulations of a similar model in the vortex representation @xcite , it was argued that only a crossover region rather than an equilibrium phase transition should occur at any nonzero temperature , since the energy of domain - wall excitations which disorder the ground state was found to approach a finite constant for increasing system sizes .",
    "however , the free energy of domain - wall excitations in the frustrated xy model obtained analytically in the phase representation @xcite was found to increase linearly with the system length , but with an extremely small numerical coefficient . as a consequence , although vortex ordering could be possible in the thermodynamic limit , domain - wall excitations would only be negligible for system sizes which are much beyond the ones studied numerically or even experimentally .",
    "it is unclear if the behavior observed in the earlier numerical works @xcite could be a signature of such vortex ordering or the effect of slow dynamics which prevents to observe the true equilibrium behavior . given these conflicting results , it should be of interest to further investigate the fully frustrated xy model using a mc method which can insure full equilibration and a scaling analysis of both phase and vortex correlations .",
    "in this work we study phase coherence and vortex order in the fully frustrated xy model on a honeycomb lattice , using the parallel - tempering method ( exchange mc method ) @xcite to obtain equilibrium configurations of the system .",
    "this method has been shown to reduce significantly the long equilibration times in glassy systems @xcite . to study the equilibrium phase transitions we use numerical data in the temperature regime in which full",
    "equilibration can be insured and employ a scaling analysis of the correlation lengths of the phase and vortex variables to extrapolate to the low - temperature and large - system limits .",
    "no evidence of an equilibrium order - disorder phase transition or even a spin / vortex - glass transition is found at nonzero temperatures .",
    "our results , however , are consistent with an equilibrium zero - temperature transition , where the critical temperature vanishes ( @xmath5 ) and the correlation lengths diverge as a power - law with decreasing temperatures and corresponding critical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this transition has important consequences for the resistivity behavior and current - voltage scaling @xcite at low temperatures in the superconducting systems described by the frustrated xy model .",
    "moreover , the near agreement of the critical exponents estimated numerically suggests a @xmath5 transition scenario , where phase and vortex variables remain coupled on large length scales .",
    "this is in contrast with the @xmath5 transition in the frustrated xy model on a square lattice at irrational frustration , where a decoupled scenario was found recently @xcite .",
    "we consider a uniformly frustrated xy model described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a phase variable defined at the sites @xmath8 of a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice ( fig .",
    "1 ) , representing the local angle of the xy spin with an arbitrary fixed direction . @xmath9 is a uniform ferromagnetic coupling and @xmath10 is a gauge - invariant quantity constrained to be @xmath11 around each plaquette of the lattice .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 controls the frustration of the system . for the fully frustrated case considered here , @xmath3 . in the calculations we choose a gauge where @xmath12 on the bonds along the horizontal rows numbered by the integer @xmath13 and @xmath14 on the vertical bonds of the lattice .    as a model of an array of superconducting grains coupled by josephson junctions , the phase @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) corresponds to the phase of the superconducting order parameter of the grains , @xmath15 is the josephson coupling between grains and @xmath10 is the line integral of the vector potential @xmath16 due to an external magnetic field @xmath17 applied perpendicular to the array . the magnetic flux in each plaquette in units of the flux quantum @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 with the frustration parameter @xmath2 corresponding to the number of flux quantum per plaquette .    in the monte carlo simulations we use the parallel tempering method @xcite to obtain equilibrium configurations . in this method , many replicas of the system with different temperatures are simulated simultaneously and the corresponding configurations are allowed to be exchanged with a probability satisfying detailed balance .",
    "the exchange process allows the configurations of the system to explore the temperature space , being cooled down and warmed up , and the system can escape more easily from metastable minima at low temperatures .",
    "full equilibration can be insured within reasonable computer time in systems of sufficiently small sizes @xcite . without the replica exchange step ,",
    "the method reduces to conventional mc simulations at different temperatures .",
    "we performed mc simulations using the heat - bath algorithm for each replica , simultaneously and independently , for a few mc passes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used on lattices with rhombic geometry ( fig .",
    "1 ) of side @xmath20 , containing @xmath21 sites . exchange of pairs of replica configurations at temperatures @xmath22 and @xmath23 and energies @xmath24 and @xmath25 is attempted with probability @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , using the metropolis scheme . the equilibration time to reach thermal equilibrium",
    "can be measured as the average number of mc passes required for each replica to travel over the whole temperature range .",
    "we used typically @xmath28 mc passes for equilibration with up to @xmath29 replicas and @xmath30 mc passes for calculations of average quantities .",
    "for the study of phase coherence , we consider the overlap order parameter @xcite of the phase variables defined as @xmath31 , where 1 and 2 denote two thermally independent copies of the system , with the same parameters @xmath15 and @xmath2 in the model of eq .",
    "[ model ] . at high temperatures , where each copy is thermally disordered",
    ", the correlation function @xmath32 is short ranged , decaying exponentially with @xmath33 , while at low temperatures it is long ranged if an ordered phase or a glassy phase exits .",
    "the latter possibility was suggested in ref . based on mc simulations and the glass phase",
    "was characterized by the behavior of the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath34 , which corresponds here to @xmath35 .",
    "the correlation length in the finite system @xmath36 can be obtained as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fourier transform of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the smallest nonzero wave vector in the finite system .",
    "this expression for the correlation length @xmath41 , which is both temperature and size dependent , can be obtained from the correlation length @xmath42 in the large system limit , @xmath43 , as a finite - difference approximation taking also into account the lattice periodicity @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath41 tends to @xmath42 for large @xmath20 , when correlations are short ranged . if there is long - range order , @xmath44 , while if there is only algebraic order @xmath45 .",
    "note that the correlation length defined in eq .",
    "( [ xieq ] ) , in terms of the overlap order parameter @xmath46 , may have a different magnitude from the correlation length defined in terms of a single copy of the system @xmath47 .",
    "however , they should have the same leading scaling behavior near the transition .",
    "analogous expressions are used to determine the correlation length for vortex variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 in terms of the overlap order parameter @xmath50 of the net vorticity @xmath51 .",
    "the vorticity @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 , where the summation is taken around the elementary plaquette located at sites @xmath54 of the dual lattice , formed by plaquette centers , and the gauge - invariant phase difference is restricted to the interval @xmath55 $ ] . for the fully frustrated case , @xmath3 , the vortex variables @xmath56 are ising - like variables and equivalent to the chirality variables originally introduced by villain @xcite .",
    "finte - size scaling can be used to extrapolate the behavior of the system to the large - system limit and temperatures near the transition . in the scaling analysis of the correlation length @xcite",
    ", we consider the dimensionless ratio @xmath57 which , for a continuous transition , should satisfy the scaling form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the critical temperature and @xmath60 is the critical exponent of the power - law divergent correlation length @xmath61 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath62 has the properties : @xmath63 , a constant , and @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "this scaling form implies that data for the scaled correlation length @xmath57 as a function of temperature , for different system sizes @xmath20 , should come together for decreasing temperatures and cross at the same temperature @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the data should splay out for different system sizes with slopes determined by the critical exponent @xmath60 . if the data satisfy the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) then we can infer that the correlation length diverges as a power - law latexmath:[$\\xi(t)\\propto    very large value of @xmath60 would be an indication that the correlation length may diverge exponentially , @xmath68 , rather than as a power law .",
    "in particular , for the standard ( unfrustrated ) xy model , which is critical at temperatures equal and below @xmath59 , curves of @xmath57 as function of decreasing temperatures for different system sizes merge @xcite near @xmath59 and remain @xmath20-independent for @xmath69 . .",
    "we study the behavior of the correlations of phase and vortex variables _ in thermal equilibrium _ , which implies that we should only use the numerical data obtained from the mc simulations in the temperature range where full equilibration is achieved .",
    "to check equilibration , we follow the trajectory in the temperature space of a replica starting at the highest temperature , where the system equilibrates fast even without the replica exchange process @xcite . in equilibrium",
    ", this replica should be able to explore the whole temperature range .",
    "for the system sizes studied , @xmath70 , equilibration was only possible for temperatures above @xmath71 , despite the improvement of the parallel tempering method . below @xmath72 ,",
    "the configurations of the replicas at different temperatures can not be warmed up and cooled down .",
    "thus @xmath72 can be regarded as a freezing temperature , below which the system remains trapped in metastable configurations within the available time scale of the present simulation .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath72 agrees with the apparent glass transition temperature @xmath73 observed in earlier mc simulations @xcite .",
    "however , as will be shown in the following , @xmath72 does not correspond to the critical temperature of an equilibrium glass transition .",
    "instead , it should be regarded as the characteristic temperature of a dynamical freezing transition .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the temperature dependence of the scaled correlation length in the @xmath74-direction for phase variables , @xmath75 , and for vortex variables , @xmath76 , in the temperature range ( @xmath77 where full equilibration was possible and for different system sizes .",
    "both quantities increase faster on lowering the temperature as the system size @xmath20 increases indicating a divergent length scale for decreasing temperatures .",
    "however , for fixed temperature they decrease with @xmath20 even at the lowest available temperature . therefore , the curves for the different system sizes do not cross or merge at a common temperature , as would be expected from the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) , if a transition occurs in this temperature range .",
    "this is more evident in the insets of figs . 2 and 3 , where lines joining the data for different system sizes are presented as a log - log plot of @xmath78 _ versus _ @xmath79 .    for the sake of comparison to the behavior of the vortex correlation for the fully frustrated case ( @xmath3 ) in figs",
    "3 , we show the results of additional calculations when the frustration parameter is @xmath4 , in fig .",
    "4 . in this case",
    ", a hexagonal vortex pattern commensurate with the honeycomb dual lattice is possible in the ground state and an order - disorder phase transition is expected at finite temperature from symmetry arguments . from the earlier work @xcite , this transition takes place at a critical temperature @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , the curves in fig . 4 cross for different system sizes at a common temperature @xmath81 , which is compatible with this estimate .",
    "for the fully frustrated case , @xmath3 , the lack of intersection of the curves of @xmath75 and @xmath82 for different system sizes at a common temperature in figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "suggests that phase coherence and vortex order , or even glass - like order , can only occur at @xmath83 , which is not accessible in our calculations , or else only at @xmath84 .",
    "the latter scenario corresponds to a phase transition where @xmath5 and the correlation length @xmath42 is finite at any nonzero @xmath79 but diverges when approaching @xmath84 . to verify the possibility of such zero - temperature transition",
    ", we first consider the scaling of the total correlation function @xmath85 defined as @xmath86 and @xmath87 for phase and vortex variables , respectively . in the absence of finite - size effects , @xmath85 should diverge as @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are constants and @xmath91 is a critical exponent .",
    "@xmath90 represents possible background corrections to scaling . using data for a large system size , where finite - size effects are negligible",
    ", we can then determine @xmath59 from the best numerical fit according to this scaling form . using a least - square fit @xcite we have obtained the error estimate @xmath92 when fitting @xmath93 against @xmath94 to a straight line , assuming different values of @xmath59 .",
    "the error estimate is defined as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of data points @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the values of the fitting function at the corresponding data points .",
    "5 and 6 show the dependence of the error @xmath99 on @xmath59 , for phase and vortex variables , respectively , for @xmath100 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath5 gives the lowest error , which suggests that a zero - temperature transition is possible .",
    "the insets in the figures show the corresponding best fits , which provide estimates of the critical exponents @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    the @xmath5 scenario can be further verified from the finite - size scaling analysis of the correlation length @xmath41 . in this case , the data for @xmath41 should satisfy the finite - size scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) with @xmath5 .",
    "the best data collapse is obtained by adjusting a single parameter , @xmath60 , providing an estimate of this critical exponent .",
    "we use the following procedure , which is a simplified version of more general methods of measuring data collapse @xcite . the standard finite - size scaling expansion near @xmath59 , @xmath103 truncated to low order ( @xmath104 , is used as a smooth interpolation function , which is convenient both for numerical data fitting and for providing a measure of the data collapse as the error defined by eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) .",
    "then we determine @xmath60 from the best least - square fit of @xmath57 to this function with @xmath105 .",
    "data for the largest temperatures are successively removed from the data collapse if this leads to a decrease of the fitting error , since in this case such data are presumably outside the asymptotic scaling regime where eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) applies .",
    "the best data collapse is obtained for temperatures @xmath106 . fig .",
    "7 shows that indeed the data for the phase variables @xmath107 satisfy the scaling form with an exponent @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , for the vortex variables , we obtain from the dada collapse in fig .",
    "8 the critical exponent @xmath109 , although the data collapse is not as good .",
    "these exponents agree with each other within the estimated errors .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the scaling behavior in eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) has only been verified here in a limited range of temperatures since there is no available data below @xmath72 , due to the lack of equilibration .",
    "this can be seen more clearly by reploting the data collapse as @xmath78 _ versus _",
    "@xmath110 , as presented in the insets of figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "indeed , @xmath78 tends to a linear behavior for large @xmath111 as expected but the finite limit for @xmath112 can not be explicitly verified .",
    "the zero - temperature transition , which was inferred here from the behavior of correlations at finite temperatures as discussed above , is also consistent with the ground - state properties of the model .",
    "as first pointed out by shih and stroud @xcite , the ground state is highly degenerate with an infinite number of different vortex configurations .",
    "therefore , correlations at zero temperature , obtained by averaging over the different configurations , can decay to zero for large distances .",
    "one possibility is that such decay obeys a power law .",
    "the triangular antiferromagnetic ising model @xcite , for example , display such behavior .",
    "another possibility is that correlations decay exponentially as in the antiferromagnetic ising model on a kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 scenario for the present model , favors a power - law decay of vortex correlations .",
    "in fact , the correlation function exponent @xmath113 associated with the transition can be obtained from the scaling law @xmath114 and the above estimates of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , giving @xmath117 , which is greater than zero implying a decay of the correlation as @xmath118 , at zero temperature . to verify this behavior more quantitatively ,",
    "we have also performed additional calculations of the finite - size dependence of the total correlation functions @xmath119 and @xmath120 near @xmath84 . however , because full equilibration was only possible for temperatures above the dynamical freezing transition @xmath72 with the present monte carlo method , we have to rely on the approximation of using low - energy states close to the ground state to perform the configuration averages .",
    "the low - energy states were obtained using the simulated - annealing method @xcite by gradual annealing from initial temperatures @xmath121 .",
    "9 shows a log - log plot of the finite - size behavior of @xmath119 and @xmath120 obtained by averaging over @xmath122 low - energy sates within a range of @xmath123 above the known ground - state energy @xcite @xmath124 .",
    "if correlations decay as a power - law in the ground state , then the finite - size behavior @xmath125 is expected near @xmath84 , for sufficiently large systems .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the data in fig .",
    "9 and from a log - log fit we estimate @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which are compatible within the estimated errors with the corresponding values obtained from @xmath91 and @xmath60 , using the finite - temperature scaling analysis .",
    "a particular feature of the frustrated xy model on the honeycomb lattice is the structure of the dual lattice , where the chiralities are defined , which has the form of a triangular lattice .",
    "since the chiralities are ising - like variables with antiferromagnetic interactions , if interactions further than nearest - neighbors are neglected , there is a geometric frustration effect which may appear similar to the case of the triangular antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the exact solution of this model @xcite shows that there is no phase transition at nonzero temperatures ( @xmath5 ) , which is the same scenario we find in the present case .",
    "however , while the correlation length for this ising model diverges exponentially @xcite , @xmath128 , corresponding to @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ scalxi ] ) , in the present case we find @xmath130 , suggesting a power - law correlation and correspondingly different ground state properties .    the near agreement of our estimates of the critical exponents for vortex variables @xmath116 and phase variables @xmath0",
    ", assuming power - law divergent correlations , suggests that the @xmath5 critical behavior may be described by a single divergent length scale . in a zero - temperature transition scenario",
    "where there is no decoupling , phase and vortex variables remain coupled on large length scales and one expects that the corresponding correlation lengths should diverge with a common critical exponent @xmath131 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this behavior is in contrast with that found for the two - dimensional xy model at irrational frustration on a square lattice @xcite , where a decoupled zero - temperature transition @xcite was found with significant different exponents @xmath132 .",
    "an additional important feature of the zero - temperature transition found from the above analysis , is the temperature dependence of the relaxation time for phase and vortex equilibrium fluctuations . if @xmath5 then the divergence of the relaxation time @xmath133 as @xmath134 is determined by thermal activation @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath133 should increase exponentially with the inverse of temperature , corresponding to a dynamical exponent @xmath135 in the usual power - law assumption latexmath:[$\\tau\\propto    calculated the relaxation time @xmath133 for different temperatures from the autocorrelation function of phase and vortex fluctuations , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , as @xmath139 in these calculations , the starting configurations were taken from the equilibrium configurations obtained with the parallel tempering method and the subsequent time dependence was obtained from standard mc simulations at each fixed temperature .",
    "the results shown on the log - linear plot in fig .",
    "10 are indeed consistent with an activated behavior of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the straight lines in the plot indicate that the data can be fitted to an arrhenius behavior , with temperature independent energy barriers @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    ". in general , the energy barrier can be temperature dependent , scaling with the correlation length @xcite as @xmath144 .",
    "the observed arrhenius behavior indicates that these additional exponents are @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "the behavior for the relaxation time @xmath140 is particularly important when the frustrated xy model is applied to superconductors since it determines the temperature dependence of the linear resistivity @xcite , @xmath147 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath148 should be finite at any nonzero temperature but decrease exponentially as temperature vanishes .",
    "we have investigated the critical behavior of the fully frustrated xy model on a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice by monte carlo methods and a scaling analysis of the phase and vortex correlations .",
    "no evidence of an equilibrium phase transition is found at nonzero temperatures , in agreement with the conclusion of ref . for a similar model .",
    "the absence of vortex ordering at finite temperatures is also in agreement with the estimates of ref . , which find that this can only be observed for very large system systems @xmath149 .",
    "however , our finite - size scaling analysis is consistent with a zero - temperature transition , where the critical temperature vanishes and phase and vortex correlation lengths , @xmath107 and @xmath150 , diverge for decreasing temperatures as a power law with a common critical exponent , suggesting a coupled @xmath5 transition scenario .",
    "since both correlation lengths remain finite in the temperature range @xmath151 , where a kt transition @xcite or a spin - glass transition @xcite was proposed to take place in earlier mc simulations , our results also indicate that these apparent transitions should be attributed to slow dynamics effects and not to an equilibrium phase transition . whether a vortex ordering transition can , nevertheless , occur for very large system sizes ( @xmath152 ) , as predicted in ref .",

    "the divergent correlation length @xmath107 in these models determine both the linear an nonlinear resistivity behavior , leading to a thermally activated linear resistivity and nonlinear current - voltage scaling at low temperatures @xcite .",
