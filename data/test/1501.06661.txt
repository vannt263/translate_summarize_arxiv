    "the advantages of the proposed methodology are as follows :    * matrices of general row size ( different from a prime and its square ) and small density are constructed .",

    "there are , however , the following advantages of using deterministic binary matrices for the stated purpose :    * binary matrices being sparse and possessing @xmath8 as elements provide multiplier - less and faster dimensionality reduction operation , which is not possible with gaussian matrices * there is a nonzero probability of non - compliance with rip for gaussian matrices    the problem ( @xcite ) of searching for similar images in a large image repository based on content is called content based image retrieval ( cbir ) .",
