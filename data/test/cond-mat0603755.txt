    "there has recently been much interest in a fascinating topic in the research community , namely _ spin hall effect _ ( she ) .",
    "she is such a phenomenon that a transverse spin current is generated when a longitudinal charge current circulates through a sample , and if the sample has a thin strip geometry , the transverse spin current will cause non - equilibrium spin accumulation at both edges of the samplehirsch1999,murakamiscience2003,sinovaprl2004",
    ". such a phenomenon would be much useful in the context of semiconductor spin - based electronics ( _ spintronics _ ) because it might provide an effective way for generating spin currents and/or non - equilibrium spin density in a nonmagnetic semiconductors without use of ferromagnetic metals or ferromagnetic semiconductors , a principal challenge in semiconductor spintronicsdassarma2004,semibook2002 . from the theoretical points of view ,",
    "such a phenomenon can arise from either _ intrinsic _ spin - orbit (  so ) coupling ( i.e. , spin - orbit splitting of the band structure ) murakamiscience2003,sinovaprl2004 or _",
    "extrinsic _ so coupling ( i.e. , spin - orbit dependent impurity scatterings ) @xcite in a semiconducting material , and correspondingly , the phenomena due to intrinsic so  coupling was termed _ intrinsic spin hall effect _ and the phenomena due to spin - orbit dependent impurity scatterings termed _ extrinsic spin hall effect_. from the standpoint of spintronic applications , intrinsic she are more attractive since it is an intrinsic property of a semiconducting material and does not rely on spin - orbit dependent impurity scatterings@xcite . recently",
    "two experiments were reported on the observation of she .",
    "one is on @xmath0-doped bulk gaas by kato et al.@xcite and the other is on two - dimensional @xmath1-doped gaas by wunderlich et al.@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon observed in two - dimensional @xmath1-doped gaas by wunderlich et al .",
    "was believed to be an intrinsic spin hall effect since the edge spin accumulation measured in a thin strip of such a system is insensitive to impurity scatterings in the weak impurity scattering regimewunderlichprl2005 , an important feature of intrinsic spin hall effectmurakamiscience2003,sinovaprl2004 .",
    "in contrast , the phenomenon observed in @xmath0-doped bulk gaas by kato et al . was believed to have an extrinsic origin ( i.e. , due to spin - orbit dependent impurity scatterings ) since the edge spin accumulation measured in a thin strip of such a system is several order of magnitude smaller compared with the theoretical predictions of refs.[2 - 3 ] .",
    "although substantial progresses have been achieved on the detection of spin hall effect , it should be noted that from the theoretical points of view there are still intensive debates on whether intrinsic spin hall effect does can survive in a spin - orbit coupled system .",
    "for example , several recent theoretical works have argued that , except for the ballistic transport limit , intrinsic spin  hall effect can not survive in a diffusive two - dimensional electron gas with rashba spin - orbit coupling even in the weak impurity scattering limitinoueprb2004,mishchenkoprl2004,rashbaprb2003 , raim05 , dim05 , szhang05 , kha06 . as to the physical understanding of the recent experimental results@xcite",
    ", some significant controversies also exist which needs further clarifications .",
    "for details please refer to refs.[16 - 25 ] .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate theoretically another kind of electric - field driven edge spin - accumulation which might occur in a thin strip of a two - dimensional electronic ( electron or hole ) system . from the theoretical points of view ,",
    "this phenomenon is essentially a _ _ kinetic magnetoelectric effect__@xcite due to boundary - confinement induced spin - orbit coupling ( which will be called _",
    "edge so coupling _ below ) .",
    "but very interestingly , it would manifest in a very similar manner as was conceived in an spin hall effect . for example , the electric - field driven edge spin accumulation in a thin 2deg strip due to this phenomenon will be polarized perpendicular to the 2deg plane but along opposite directions at both edges of the strip ; and in the weak impurity scattering regime ( below a certain disorder strength ) the edge spin accumulation will not decrease as the disorder strength increases , thus it can survive even in the diffusive transport regime .",
    "these features are very similar to the recently discovered spin hall effect , but the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are very different from that of the usual spin hall effect from the theoretical points of view",
    ". the results obtained in the present paper might provide some new implications to the proper physical understanding of the recent experimental results@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as following : in section ii an edge so coupling model describing the boundary - confinement induced so coupling in a thin 2deg strip will be introduced and some details of the theoretical formalism used in the paper will be briefly explained , and in section iii some numerical results will be presented and discussed .",
    "the system considered in the present paper consists of a thin 2deg strip connected to two ideal leads , as was shown in fig.1(a ) . according to the theory of the relativistic quantum mechanics , if the movement of an electron is confined by a spatially non - uniform potential , the spin and orbital degree of freedom of the electron",
    "will be coupled together@xcite .",
    "the longitudinal direction of the strip will be defined as the @xmath2 direction and the normal of the 2deg plane defined as the @xmath3 direction . for the sake of simplification",
    ", we assume that the confining potential is spatially uniform along the longitudinal direction of the strip , i.e. , the spatial variation of the confining potential occurs only in the transverse direction of the strip ( defined as the @xmath4 direction ) . under this assumption , the so coupling due to the transverse spatial variation of the confining potential will take the following form@xcite , @xmath5where @xmath6 are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath7 is the wave vector of electrons , @xmath8 denotes the usual gradient operator and @xmath9 is the transverse confining potential , which depends only on the @xmath4 coordinates . from the effective hamiltonian ( 1 )",
    "one can see that , for an electron moving along the @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) direction , the so coupling will tend to force the electron spin to align along the @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) direction , depending on the sign of @xmath14 . in the absence of external electric field",
    ", the numbers of electrons moving along the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions are equal and no net spin density can be resulted . however , if an external electric field is applied in the longitudinal direction of the strip , the numbers of electrons moving to @xmath11 direction will be larger than the number of electrons moving to the @xmath10 direction , and hence a net spin density polarized along the @xmath12 or @xmath15 @xmath13 @xmath16 direction might be resulted from the so coupling .",
    "such an effect was dubbed the _ kinetic magnetoelectric effect _ in the literatureedelstein .        for a 2deg strip ,",
    "if the strip width is much larger than the lattice constant , one can further assume that the confining potential @xmath9 varies substantially only in a narrow boundary region as was shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "( we assume that the two boundaries of the srip are located at @xmath17 ) .",
    "then the so coupling exists only near both edges of the strip , and due to the symmetry of the confining potential , the so coupling coefficient ( proportional to @xmath18 ) has opposite signs at both edges of the strip , as was shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "thus , the edge so coupling model described by the effective hamiltonian ( 1 ) implies that the electric - field driven spin accumulation will be polarized along opposite directions ( normal to the 2deg plane ) at both edges of the strip , similar to a spin hall effect .",
    "this will be confirmed by detailed numerical calculations below . in order to make a comparison with the widely studied intrinsic spin hall effect in a rashba two - dimensional electron gas",
    ", we can also include a rashba so coupling in our edge so coupling model .",
    "then the total hamiltonian of the 2deg strip will be @xmath19where the second term is the rashba so coupling ( which arises from the inversion asymmetry of the trapping well along the normal of the 2deg plane ) and @xmath20 the rashba so  coupling constant .",
    "( @xmath21 is a unit vector along the normal of the 2deg plane ) . a direct use of the hamiltonian ( 2 ) is not convenient if one wants to take into account the effects of impurity scatterings properly , which are very important in the diffusive transport regime .",
    "so in our calculations we will transform the hamiltonian ( 2 ) into a discrete form . the discrete version of the effective hamiltonian for the total system ( including both the leads and the 2deg strip )",

    "another slight difference that can be seen from fig.2(a ) and 2(b ) is that , the transverse spatial distribution of the spin density has a very regularly striped pattern in the case of the edge so coupling model , but for the case of the usual rashba model , the spin - density pattern is not much regularly striped .",
    "this slight difference arises from the fact that , in the case of our edge so coupling model , the so coupling exists only in a narrow boundary region near both edge of the 2deg strip ( see the illustration shown in fig.1(b - c ) ) and was assumed to be uniform along the longitudinal direction of the strip .",
    "these assumptions lead to a regularly striped spin - density pattern as shown in fig.2(a ) . for the case of the usual rashba model ,",
    "the so coupling exists in entire the strip ( i.e. , the so coupling coefficient is nonzero everywhere in the strip ) , thus the spin - density pattern in the strip is not much regularly striped .     in the case of the edge so coupling model .",
    "the lattice sizes of the 2deg strip are chosen as : ( a ) @xmath105 , ( b ) @xmath106 , ( c ) @xmath107 , and ( d ) @xmath108 .",

    "fig.3(e ) shows the dependences of the transverse spatial distribution of @xmath110 on the edge so coupling strength , where the lattice size is fixed to be @xmath111 in all these calculations , the width of the boundary region in which the edge so coupling exists is set to be @xmath112 .",
    ", width=302,height=377 ]    next , we study the dependence of the edge spin accumulation on the strip width and the so coupling strength in the case of the edge so coupling model . because the spatial distribution of the spin density has a regularly striped pattern along the longitudinal direction , we can use an averaged value of @xmath113 , defined by @xmath114 , as a measure of the spin accumulation . in fig.3(a - d ) we plot the profiles of the transverse spatial distribution of the spin accumulation obtained in several different cases with different lattice sizes . from these figures",
    "one can see that , @xmath115 oscillates inside the strip and has opposite signs on both edges of the strip , and the magnitude of the spin density will reach a maximum value ( denoted as @xmath116 below ) near both edges of the strip . as the strip width increases ,",
    "the transverse spatial distribution of the spin accumulation become sharper and sharper near both edges of the strip and the oscillations of the amplitude of the spin density inside the strip tend to be smeared , i.e. , the spin accumulation will be localized near both edges of the strip if the strip width is much larger than the lattice constant . from these figures",
    "one can also note that , the order of the magnitude of the spin density near both edges of the strip remains unchanged as the strip width increases , suggesting that the electric - field induced edge spin accumulation due to boundary - confinement induced edge so coupling can survive even in the diffusive transport regime , similar to the phenomenon reported in ref.[8 ] .",
    "( for a 2d semiconductor strip with rashba spin - orbit coupling , it was generally believed that the intrinsic spin hall effect can not survive in the diffusive transport regimeinoueprb2004,mishchenkoprl2004,rashbaprb2003 , raim05 , dim05 , szhang05 , kha06 ) .",
    "the dependence of the transverse spatial distribution of the spin density on the edge so coupling strength was shown in fig.3(e ) , from which one can see that the profiles of the transverse spatial distribution of the spin density do not change substantially as the edge so coupling strength varies .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects of random impurity scatterings on the electric - field induced nonequilibrium spin density in the case of the edge so coupling model .",
    "to include properly the effects of random impurity scatterings , we assume that the on - site energy @xmath117 in the 2deg strip are randomly but uniformly distributed in an energy region @xmath118 $ ] , where @xmath119 is the amplitude of the on - site energy fluctuations , which characterizes the disorder strengthlshengprl2005,nikolicprb2005",
    ". we will calculate the spin density for a number of random impurity configurations and then do impurity average .",
    "in fig.4(a - b ) we show the relation between the edge spin accumulation and the disorder strength in both cases of ( a ) the edge so coupling model and ( b ) the usual rashba model , respectively .",
    "we have done impurity average over 10000 random impurity configurations for each case . from fig.4(a ) one can see that , for the case of the edge so coupling model , the edge spin accumulation does not decrease ( or may even increase ) as the disorder strength increases in the weak impurity scattering regime ( i.e. , below a certain disorder strength ) and for a fixed longitudinal change current density ( @xmath101 ) , similar to the intrinsic spin hall effect observed by wunderlich et al.@xcite . in contrast , for the case of the rashba model , the edge spin accumulation decreases monotonously as the disorder strength increases even in the weak impurity scattering limit , which can be seen clearly from fig.4(b ) .     on the disorder strength @xmath119 in both cases of ( a )",
    "the edge so coupling model and ( b ) the rashba so model . in the weak impurity scattering regime ( below a certain disorder strength ) , the edge spin accumulation _ do not _ decrease as the disorder strength increases in the case of the edge so coupling model . ]",
    "the different behaviors in these two models can be understood qualitatively as following . for the edge",
    "so coupling model , the so coupling exists only in a narrow boundary region near both edges of the strip ( see the illustration shown in fig.1(b - c ) ) .",
    "the electric - field induced nonequilibrium spin density in this model is due to the kinetic magnetoelectric effect but not due to the flow of a transverse spin hall current , thus only those scattering events occurred near both edges of the strip will affect substantially the spin density .",
    "in contrast , for the case of the rashba model , the electric - field induced nonequilibrium spin density is due to the flow of a transverse spin hall current@xcite , which will be damped significantly by all random impurity scattering events occurred in entire the strip and hence the edge spin accumulation will be decreased substantially with increasing disorder strength even in the weak impurity scattering limit .",
    "of course , because localization effects will become important in the presence of strong impurity scatterings , the electric - field induced nonequilibrium spin density in the case of the edge so coupling model will also be decreased substantially in the presence of strong impurity scatterings , which can be seen clearly from fig.4(a ) .    in summary , we have presented a microscopic model calculation for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect in a thin strip of a two - dimensional electronic system due to boundary - confinement induced edge so coupling . we have shown that this effect can manifest in a very similar form as was conceived in a spin hall effect@xcite , and some important features of this effect are similar to the intrinsic spin hall effect observed recently in thin strips of two - dimensional _ p_-doped semiconductors@xcite .",
