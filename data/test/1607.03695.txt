    "dusty debris around main - sequence stars results from collisions between rocky bodies .",
    "timescales for the particles to fall into the star or grind down to sizes small enough to be blown out by radiation pressure are short compared to stellar lifetimes , so larger progenitor planetesimals must be present . in most cases , these are found to be in belts located at tens of au , where rock / ice comet - like compositions are probable , akin to solar system cometary material .",
    "although collisions should cause the ices to sublimate into gases , this component in the belts is difficult to detect , as molecules are quickly photo - dissociated . for nearby debris - hosting stars , e.g. fomalhaut ,",
    "improved limits from deep observations are important for comparing the chemistry to solar system comets ( matr et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "there are five a - type debris hosts where the molecule carbon monoxide ( co ) has been detected , via millimetre rotational transitions .",
    "this species photo - dissociates on hundreds of year timescales even under interstellar radiation ( zuckerman & song 2012 , e.g. ) . when illuminated by a - stars , this timescale can be shortened to less than orbital periods at tens of au ( jackson et al .",
    "2014 , e.g. ) .",
    "if co is preferentially produced at one location in the disk then the co distribution would be ` one - sided ' around the star , and this effect has been imaged recently in an alma study of @xmath1 pic ( dent et al . 2014 ; matr et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "other gas phases can also be present , with cii and oi lines in the far - infrared ( dent et al .",

    "three of the co - hosting systems also appear to host ` falling evaporating bodies ' , with transient red - shifted ca - absorption features seen towards @xmath1 pic and 49 cet ( montgomery & welsh 2012 ) , and na absorption identified towards hd 32297 ( redfield 2007 ) .",
    "these features are consistent with volatiles originating from ongoing cometary breakups , an idea which is now being explored by models ( kral et al .",
    "2016 , e.g. ) .    here",
    "we consider debris - hosting a - stars within 125 pc ( parallax @xmath28 mas ) that have been searched for co. this distance limit helps to exclude stars outside the local bubble where interstellar co may be a strong contaminant .",
    "we report the sixth detection of co , around the approximately 30 myr - old a0 star hd 32297 . in this case",
    ", we successfully used the presence of weak cii emission ( donaldson et al .",
    "2013 ) as a predictor for the presence of co.    we have also followed co detections for 49 ceti and hd 21997 ( zuckerman et al . 1995 ; mor et al . 2011 ) with dust continuum - imaging at 450 and 850 micron wavelength .",
    "these continuum data are part of the jcmt legacy project sons ( scuba-2 survey of nearby stars ) , described by pani et al . ( 2013 ) .",

    "( 2008 ) , and was resolved at arcsec resolution .",
    "the disc was found to be extended and elliptical , with a strong asymmetry , in that the centroid is offset from the star with 4-sigma confidence .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,>,>,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     in figure 8 , whole - disc co line - profiles are shown for four systems . for @xmath1 pic ,",
    "archival alma observations in co j=2 - 1 were used to generate disc - integrated spectra ( with sensitivity up to arcmin scales ) . for 49 ceti and hd 141569",
    ", we used co 3 - 2 lines extracted from single - beam jcmt data .",
    "the plots show tests for asymmetry , where the line velocities around the central dip have been swapped in sign , and used to generate a blue - red difference spectrum . where this residual is non - zero , the emission from the the approach and receding sides of the disc is not the same , as for example in many sightlines across the model disc in figure 7 .",
    "from this analysis , we find that co asymmetry is most marked in @xmath1 pic .",
    "the high signal - to - noise line is asymmetric in both height and width of the blue and red sides , reflecting the clump that has been spatially resolved ( dent et al .",
    "2013 ) . for 49 ceti",
    ", the overall line shape appears similar to @xmath1 pic , but the nature of any asymmetry is hard to characterise .",
    "hughes ( 2014 ) has presented alma observations of the 49 ceti disc ( sampling scales only up to @xmath1410 arcsec ) and the line profile shows some differences to that from the jcmt .",
    "extended emission could thus be affecting the single dish spectrum , although it appears uncontaminated by the northern object seen by scuba-2 ( alma sees no low - velocity co here ) .",
    "the line asymmetry for hd 32297 is only at 2.5-sigma confidence , and the visual appearance of asymmetry for hd 141569 is at the level of noise in the difference spectrum .    owing to the short dissociation time for co molecules , whole - disc spectra might be expected to be more skewed than the dust distributions .",
    "table 3 attempts to quantify this using the integrated intensities of the blue / red sides of the co lines , and the total dust fluxes observed to either side of the star .",
    "the available data are rather eclectic , but two systems do hint at the expected skewness behaviour .",
    "both @xmath1 pic and 49 cet appear more asymmetric in co than in dust , using these measures , although the co profile for the latter is uncertain , as discussed above .",
    "hd 32297 and hd 131835 have spectral data too noisy to discriminate , while hd 21997 and hd 141569 appear more asymmetric in _",
    "dust_. however , these two systems appear to have optically thick co lines such that saturation would maximise intensity in both line - halves .",
    "the less abundant isotopologue @xmath15co has recently been imaged in the 2 - 1 transition ( hd 21997 : kospl et al .",
    "2013 ; hd 141569 : pricaud et al .",
    "2016 ) , and greater blue / red asymmetry begins to appear in these less saturated lines",
    ". both of these studies found large masses of co , however , that may be inconsistent with sources in a comet belt .",
    "the implications for the origin of the gas ( collisional versus remnant proto - planetary discs ) are discussed by zuckerman & song ( 2012 ) and mor et al .",
    "with the discovery of co molecules around hd 32297 , there are now six a - type main - sequence stars where dusty debris is known to be accompanied by carbon monoxide gas . in the age bracket spanning 5 - 50 myr , nearly half of the a - stars with debris in fact exhibit carbon - bearing gas .",
    "this suggests a prolonged active epoch where giant collisions release a burst of gas from frozen volatiles .",
    "the time period is similar to that taken to assemble the earth from colliding planetesimals ( e.g. jacobson & walsh 2015 ) , so further study may yield clues to how volatiles are folded into rocky planets and their atmospheres .    as the photo - dissociation time for co around a - type stars is short , the gas profiles will tend to be asymmetric if debris originates from one spatial location , with molecules mainly on one side of the star .",
    "this is supported for 1 - 2 systems where the gas asymmetry appears to exceed that of the dust .",
    "models can explain a high incidence of co detection when the molecules are short - lived if , for example , colliding debris repeatedly passes through the original impact point .",
    "however , at least two of the discs are optically thick in co emission , suggesting the gas may not be collisional , but instead represent a very prolonged proto - planetary disc phase .",
