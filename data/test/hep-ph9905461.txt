    "five experiments have measured solar neutrino fluxes that are significantly deficient relative to standard solar model expectations@xcite .",
    "four out of the five experiments find overall fluxes that are roughly @xmath3 of the theoretical predictions .",
    "( the chlorine experiment sees a larger deficit . )",
    "maximal mixing between the electron neutrino and a sterile flavour has been proposed as the underlying explanation for these observations@xcite .",
    "this oscillation mode produces a @xmath3 reduction in the day - time solar neutrino flux for a large range of the relevant @xmath2 parameter : @xmath4 the upper bound arises from the lack of @xmath5 disappearence in the chooz experiment@xcite does not necessarily lead to any inconsistency with bounds imposed by big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite . ] , while the lower bound is a rough estimate of the transition region between the totally averaged oscillation regime and the `` just - so '' regime .",
    "the very special feature of maximal mixing between the @xmath1 and a sterile flavour is well motivated by the exact parity model ( also known as the mirror matter model)@xcite . in this theory , the sterile flavour maximally mixing with the @xmath1 is identified with the mirror electron neutrino .",
    "the characteristic maximal mixing feature occurs because of the underlying exact parity symmetry between the ordinary and mirror sectors .",
    "the potentially maximal mixing observed for atmospheric muon neutrinos is beautifully in accord with this framework @xcite , which sees the atmospheric neutrino problem resolved through ` @xmath6 mirror partner ' oscillations . _",
    "the exact parity model therefore provides a unified understanding of the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems : each is due to maximal oscillations of the relevant ordinary neutrino into its mirror partner .",
    "_ note that the mirror neutrino scenario is phenomenologically similar to the pseudo - dirac scenario@xcite .",
    "the chlorine result is not quantitatively consistent with this view of the origin of the solar neutrino anomaly , it being about @xmath7 too low .",
    "we await with interest some new experiments that have the capacity to double - check this result .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a more detailed analysis of the maximal @xmath0 solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we do so because of two recent developments : ( i ) the clarification from guth et al.@xcite that a day - night asymmetry generically exists even for maximal mixing ( due to earth regeneration which affects the night - time events ) and ( ii ) the observation by superkamiokande of an interesting feature in the recoil electron energy spectrum for @xmath8 mev@xcite .",
    "we will calculate the day - night asymmetry and the recoil electron spectrum as a function of @xmath2 in the range @xmath9 ev@xmath10 to @xmath11 ev@xmath10 .",
    "we will draw the important conclusion that the maximal @xmath0 scenario has a larger number of characteristic and testable features than realised hitherto .",
    "we will summarise the `` smoking gun '' experimental signatures for this scenario in the concluding section .",
    "guth et al.@xcite  have recently provided a very lucid account of the physics of the day - night effect for maximally mixed solar neutrinos .",
    "this is important for the maximal @xmath0 scenario for two reasons .",
    "first , high statistics experiments such as superkamiokande have an on - going programme to measure the solar neutrino day - night asymmetry .",
    "it had been previously and erroneously thought that maximally mixed @xmath1 s would _ not _ give rise to a day - night asymmetry .",
    "we will calculate this asymmetry for the total , energy - integrated flux relevant for superkamiokande as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we will see that the present data already rule out a range of @xmath2 .",
    "if a nonzero asymmetry were to be experimentally established in the future , then this would _ not _ falsify the maximal @xmath0 scenario , contrary to previous belief .",
    "rather , such an observation would help to pin down the actual value of @xmath2 .",
    "the second consequence of doing the physics correctly is the revelation that the night - time flux reduction is generically _ not _ an energy - independent factor of a half as previously advertised .",
    "this is simply because the earth regeneration effect @xcite is energy - dependent .",
    "data samples which do not separate day - time and night - time observations would thus be expected to show a ( weak ) energy dependent suppression if the maximal @xmath0 scenario is correct .    since the paper by guth et al .",
    "provides a complete account of how the day - night asymmetry is calculated , we will not repeat all of this material here .",
    "suffice it to say that we checked our numerical procedure by recalculating some of the results given by guth et al .  for maximal @xmath12 oscillations .",
    "we found agreement .",
    "the new computation we present here is very similar , but involves changing the effective potential for neutrino oscillations in the earth to the one relevant for @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "it is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi constant , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the terrestrial electron ( neutron ) number density , @xmath17 is the nucleon mass , @xmath18 is the terrestrial mass density , and @xmath19 is the number density of electrons per nucleon .",
    "we used the terrestrial density profile given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the core of the computation is the determination of the recoil electron flux @xmath20 at apparent recoil energy @xmath21 and zenith angle @xmath22 ( using the notation of guth et al . ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the boron neutrino spectrum @xcite , @xmath25 is the energy resolution function given by @xcite @xmath26 , \\label{resolutionfunction}\\ ] ] and the effective cross - section is given by @xcite @xmath27 the function @xmath28 is the electron neutrino survival probability incorporating matter effects in the earth , and @xmath29 is the @xmath30 scattering cross - section .",
    "the resolution width is given by@xcite @xmath31 .",
    "our result is presented in fig.1 , where the energy integrated day - night asymmetry @xmath32 is plotted as a function of @xmath2 for maximal @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the asymmetry is defined by @xmath33 \\over \\int_{6.5\\ \\text{mev}}^{\\infty } dt \\left [ n(t ) + d(t ) \\right ]     } , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 mev is the energy threshold relevant for the day - night asymmetry measurement of superkamiokande , @xmath35 is the day - time recoil electron flux and @xmath36 is the night - time flux .",
    "the day - night asymmetry is computed from @xmath20 via the procedure described in appendix b of guth et al .",
    "an average is performed over all zenith angles and seasons of the year .",
    "observe that the day - night asymmetry is positive and peaks with a value of about @xmath37 when @xmath38 ev@xmath10 .",
    "the present superkamiokande result@xcite , @xmath39 yields a @xmath40 upper bound of roughly @xmath41 which is plotted as a horizontal line in fig.1 .",
    "we see that the range @xmath42 is disfavoured at the @xmath40 level .",
    "the regions immediately to the side of the disfavoured region will obviously be probed as more data are gathered .",
    "the asymmetry falls to the @xmath43 level at about @xmath44 ev@xmath10 and @xmath45 ev@xmath10 .",
    "if a positive nonzero value for @xmath32 were to be measured , then an ambiguity would remain in the determination of @xmath2 : values on either side of the presently disfavoured region can produce the same @xmath32 . this ambiguity could in principle be resolved from a determination of the energy dependence of the night - time rate .",
    "figures 2a and 2b depict the energy dependence of the flux reduction for two representative values of @xmath2 on either side of the disfavoured region .",
    "figure 2a takes @xmath46 ev@xmath10 , with the solid ( dotted ) line showing the ratio of night - time ( day - time ) flux per unit energy to the no - oscillation expectation .",
    "the dot - dashed curve is the average .",
    "note that the day - time rate is rigorously an energy - independent factor of two less than the no - oscillation rate , while the night - time rate is @xmath47 higher than the day - time rate and is weakly energy - dependent .",
    "figure 2b considers the same quantities for @xmath48 ev@xmath10 .",
    "note that the slopes of the night - time fluxes have opposite signs on opposite sides of the disfavoured region .",
    "the energy dependence becomes unobservably small for @xmath2 values away from the interval around @xmath49 ev@xmath10 .",
    "an interesting situation exists at present with regard to the recoil electron energy spectrum measured by superkamiokande@xcite .",
    "if the @xmath50 neutrino flux predictions from standard solar models are taken at face value , then superkamiokande has evidence for a distortion in the boron neutrino induced recoil energy spectrum for energies greater than about 13 mev .",
    "we will call this the `` spectral anomaly '' .",
    "more specifically , the spectral anomaly is an excess of events relative to what would be expected on the basis of an energy - independent boron neutrino flux reduction of about @xmath3 .",
    "the observed distortion also disfavours the popular small and large mixing angle msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "one can readily identify three possible interpretations of the spectral anomaly : ( i ) standard solar models grossly underestimate the @xmath50 neutrino flux .",
    "( ii ) there is an as yet unidentified systematic error in the energy resolution function used by superkamiokande , and/or in their energy calibration .",
    "( iii ) it is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "( iv ) new physics is the cause",
    ". we will not consider ( i ) in this paper , and instead focus on ( iv ) . before doing so",
    ", we briefly discuss ( ii ) as a cautionary note .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the effect of varying the resolution width @xmath51 .",
    "we fit the data by minimising the @xmath52 function @xmath53 ^ 2 + \\left [ { f - 1 \\over \\sigma(f ) } \\right]^2 , \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the measured recoil electron flux in energy bin @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the theoretical no - oscillation expectation for same , @xmath57 represents an energy independent @xmath3 suppression due ( for instance ) to averaged maximal @xmath0 oscillations and @xmath58 is a boron neutrino flux normalisation parameter to take account of the theoretical uncertainty @xmath59 in this quantity @xcite .",
    "we include the two low energy bins , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as well as the 16 other energy bins used by superkamiokande @xcite .",
    "seasonal and daily averages are taken .",
    "these data are fitted by varying @xmath58 and the quantity @xmath62 defined through @xmath63 we find the minimum at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 for @xmath67 degrees of freedom , which is a good fit .",
    "the spectral anomaly becomes an artifact of the finite resolution of the detector .",
    "superkamiokande quote a central value for @xmath62 of about @xmath68@xcite .",
    "we can see from fig.3 that a @xmath69 systematic shift upward of @xmath62 would remove the anomaly .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with fig.1 from ref.@xcite which shows the effect of an unidentified systematic error in the energy calibration of the detector .",
    "systematic errors in either or both of the energy resolution and energy calibration can in principle explain the spectral anomaly .",
    "having sounded this cautionary note , we now proceed on the basis that superkamiokande have in fact correctly determined their energy resolution and calibration capabilities , and that new physics is behind the spectral anomaly .",
    "it is easy to understand how the spectral anomaly can be explained in a very amusing way through maximal @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "it could be that @xmath2 is such that the transition energy between the averaged oscillation regime and the just - so regime is about 13 mev@xcite ! the spectral anomaly might represent the onset of just - so behaviour .",
    "this would of course be a great piece of luck , but we probably should not disregard the possibility just out of world weary pessimism . to determine the @xmath2 value required to achieve this effect , the appropriate @xmath52 function is minimised by varying @xmath2 and @xmath58 . the appropriate @xmath52 is similar to eq.([chi2 ] ) , except that @xmath70 is replaced by a properly computed convolution integral .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath52 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "there are deep local minima in the @xmath71 ev@xmath10 to @xmath72 ev@xmath10 region , which then trail off into a flat @xmath52 as the averaged oscillation regime is entered .",
    "the minimum @xmath52 value is about 17 at @xmath73 ev@xmath10 ( and @xmath74 ) , which for 17 degrees of freedom represents a excellent fit .",
    "this @xmath2 can in principle be further probed through the anomalous seasonal effect .",
    "preliminary calculations employing the @xmath2 which minimises @xmath52 show that an effect of about @xmath75 in magnitude can be obtained for the near - far asymmetry for certain of the higher energy bins of superkamiokande .",
    "we hope to return to an analysis of the seasonal effect in a later paper .",
    "maximal @xmath0 oscillations have been proposed as a solution to the solar neutrino problem@xcite .",
    "this idea can be well - motivated by the mirror matter hypothesis@xcite , or by the pseudo - dirac neutrino idea@xcite . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated the following points :    1 .   across the allowed @xmath2 spectrum ,",
    "maximal @xmath0 oscillations lead to three qualitatively different behaviours for the @xmath1 survival probability ; just - so , msw or approximately energy independent .",
    "these occur in the @xmath76 ranges @xmath77 .",
    "the day - night asymmetry observable provides for an experimental probe in the msw regime .",
    "the recoil electron energy spectrum and the anomalous seasonal effect likewise provide a probe in the just - so regime .",
    "day - night asymmetry data rule out the range @xmath78 ev@xmath10 for @xmath2 at the @xmath40 level .",
    "a positive measurement of the day - night asymmetry would pin down the preferred value to two possibilities on either side of the disfavoured region , and the energy dependence of the night - time rate could in principle resolve the ambiguity .",
    "3 .   the superkamiokande spectral anomaly can be explained in this scenario if @xmath2 takes any of the three or four values corresponding to the local minima in fig.4 .",
    "we have shown that increasing superkamiokande resolution width by @xmath69 would also explain the spectral data .",
    "finally , the @xmath2 region @xmath79 ev@xmath10 region can be probed through the @xmath5 disappearence experiment kamland@xcite as well as through the atmospheric neutrino experiments@xcite .",
    "note from the above that the region @xmath80 ev@xmath10 is without a smoking - gun signature .",
    "of course , another important test of the scenario for the entire @xmath2 range of interest will be the neutral to charged current ratio at sno@xcite : they should obtain the no - oscillation value .",
    "in addition , the borexino @xcite and iodine @xcite experiments will double check the greater than @xmath3 suppression result distilled from the chlorine experiment .",
