    "the yokonuma  hecke algebras ( of type gl ) , denoted @xmath1 , have been used by j. juyumaya and s. lambropoulou to construct invariants for various types of links , in the same spirit as the construction of the homflypt polynomial from usual hecke algebras .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein . in particular , the algebras @xmath1 provide invariants for classical links and the natural question was to decide if these invariants were equivalent , or not , to the homflypt polynomial .",
    "this study culminated in the recent discovery @xcite that these invariants are actually topologically stronger than the homflypt polynomial ( _ i.e. _ they distinguish more links ) .    in @xcite , another approach to study invariants coming from yokonuma ",
    "hecke algebras was developed .",
    "the starting point was the fact that the algebra @xmath1 is isomorphic to a direct sum of matrix algebras with coefficients in tensor products of usual hecke algebras .",
    "this allowed an explicit construction of markov traces on @xmath2 from the known markov trace on hecke algebras ( on hecke algebras , there is a unique markov trace up to normalisation , and it gives the homflypt polynomial ) .",
    "in addition to its usefulness for the construction of markov traces , the approach via the isomorphism also helps to study the resulting invariants .",
    "indeed some properties of the invariants follow quite immediately from a precise understanding of the isomorphism ( see paragraph * 4 * below ) .",
    "independently of which approach is used , another ingredient was added in @xcite : a third parameter in the invariants . while the first two parameters come from the algebra @xmath1 , this third parameter @xmath3 has its origin in the framed braid group , and corresponds to a certain degree of freedom one has when going from the framed braid group to the algebra @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we can deform the standard surjective morphism from the framed braid group algebra to its quotient @xmath1 into a family of morphisms ( depending on @xmath3 ) respecting the braid relations and the markov conditions .",
    "another way of interpreting the parameter @xmath3 is that it modifies the quadratic relation satisfied by the generators of @xmath1 .",
    "its existence explains ( or is reflected in ) the fact that different presentations for @xmath1 were used before .",
    "lambropoulou invariants correspond to certain specialisations of this parameter @xmath3 , depending on the chosen presentation .",
    "so the parameter @xmath3 unifies every possible choices and yields more general invariants .",
    "it is indicated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 8.5 ) that changing the presentation seems to give a non - equivalent topological invariant .",
    ".2 cm * 2 . * in this paper , we consider the affine yokonuma ",
    "hecke algebras ( of type gl ) , denoted @xmath4 .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite in connections with the representation theory and the jucys ",
    "murphy elements of the classical yokonuma  hecke algebras .",
    "our main goal here is to generalise for @xmath4 the whole approach to link invariants via the isomorphism theorem .",
    "the invariants are in general for links in the solid torus .",
    "the classical links are naturally contained in the solid torus links and , restricted to them , the obtained invariants correspond to the invariants obtained in @xcite from @xmath1 ( naturally seen as a subalgebra of @xmath4 ) . specialising the parameter @xmath3",
    ", we identify the juyumaya ",
    "lambropoulou invariants among them . for those invariants ,",
    "we emphasize that we recover some known results @xcite by a different method and furthermore obtain some new results already in this particular case .",
    "we start with an isomorphism between the algebra @xmath4 and a direct sum of matrix algebras with coefficients in tensor products of affine hecke algebras .",
    "as done in @xcite , the isomorphism can be proved repeating the same arguments as for @xmath1 ( see @xcite where the proof for @xmath1 is presented , as a particular case of a more general result by g. lusztig @xcite ) . here",
    "we sketch a short different proof for @xmath4 using the known result for @xmath1 .",
    "we also prove the analogous theorem for the cyclotomic quotients of @xmath4 ( with ariki  koike algebras replacing affine hecke algebras ) .",
    "useful for concrete use , the formulas for the generators are simple and given explicitly .    concerning links ,",
    "s. lambropoulou constructed invariants , analogues of the homflypt polynomial , for links in the solid torus from affine hecke algebras @xcite .",
    "then , it was explained in @xcite how to obtain invariants for those links from the algebras @xmath4 , unifying the methods of j. juyumaya and s. lambropoulou for @xmath1 and the construction of s. lambropoulou for affine hecke algebras .",
    "due to the recent results of @xcite , it is expected that the invariants obtained from @xmath4 are stronger than the ones obtained from affine hecke algebras .    here",
    "we follow the alternative approach which uses the isomorphism to construct markov traces on the family of algebras @xmath5 . to sum up ,",
    "the markov traces are constructed and can be calculated with the following steps : for an element of @xmath4 , apply first the isomorphic map to obtain an element of the direct sum of matrix algebras ; then , for each matrix , apply the usual trace which results in an element of a tensor product of affine hecke algebras ; finally apply a tensor product of markov traces on affine hecke algebras .",
    "our result consists in obtaining the compatibility conditions relating the markov traces appearing in different matrix algebras so that the preceding procedure eventually results in a genuine markov trace on @xmath5 .    with the definition used here , for a given @xmath6 , the set of markov traces on @xmath5 forms a vector space .",
    "from the isomorphism , a set of distinguished markov traces appears naturally , which spans the set of all markov traces constructed here .",
    "thus , our study of markov traces ( and of invariants ) is reduced to the study of these  basic \" markov traces ( and of the corresponding  basic \" invariants ) .",
    "it turns out that these basic markov traces are indexed , for a given @xmath6 , by the non - empty subsets @xmath7 together with a choice , denoted formally by @xmath8 , of @xmath9 arbitrary markov traces on affine hecke algebras .",
    "we note that if we restrict to @xmath1 , the parameter @xmath8 disappears and the basic markov traces on @xmath2 are indexed , for a given @xmath6 , only by the non - empty subsets @xmath7 .",
    "this recovers a result of @xcite .",
    ".2 cm * 3 .",
    "* throughout the paper , we intended to give in details the connections between the two approaches , so that one would be able to pass easily from one to the other .",
    "this will allow in particular to specialise and translate all our results on the invariants to juyumaya ",
    "lambropoulou invariants as well .    roughly speaking",
    ", j. juyumaya and s. lambropoulou constructed invariants from @xmath1 in two steps @xcite .",
    "the same approach was followed in @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "first a certain trace map , analogous to the ocneanu trace and satisfying a certain positive markov condition , was constructed .",
    "then a rescaling procedure was implemented , in order to produce genuine invariants .",
    "the rescaling procedure amounts to two things : a renormalisation of the generators and a renormalisation , depending on @xmath10 , of the trace . in the approach presented here , the first step is included from the beginning in a more general quadratic relation for the generators .",
    "the second step is already included in the definition of a markov trace , namely that it is a family , on @xmath10 , of trace maps satisfying the two markov conditions . as a consequence , to obtain invariants here , one directly applies the markov trace and no rescaling procedure is needed .    for the comparison ,",
    "our first task is to explain that juyumaya ",
    "lambropoulou approach is equivalent to considering certain markov traces ( with the definition used here ) and to relate their variables with the parameters considered here .",
    "then we need to identify these markov traces in terms of the ones constructed via the isomorphism theorem .",
    "we obtain finally the explicit decomposition of these markov traces in terms of the basic markov traces indexed by @xmath7 and @xmath8 as above .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 , this results in an explicit formula for the juyumaya  lambropoulou invariants , as studied in @xcite , in terms of the basic invariants constructed here .",
    "we note that , in this case , the parameter @xmath8 is not present , and that juyumaya ",
    "lambropoulou invariants are also parametrised , for a given @xmath6 , by non - empty subsets of @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , they do not coincide with the basic invariants and the comparison formula is not trivial ( see formulas ( [ compare2 ] ) in section [ sec - inv ] ) . in general , for @xmath4 , we obtain the expression of the invariants constructed in @xcite in terms of the basic invariants constructed here .",
    "concerning the third parameter @xmath3 , we recall that it was not present in the previous approach . actually",
    ", one need to specialise it to a certain value in our invariants to recover the juyumaya",
    " lambropoulou invariants .",
    "the two different presentations of @xmath1 that were used , as in @xcite , correspond to two different values of @xmath3 that we give explicitly . similarly , for @xmath4 , the invariants constructed in @xcite correspond to a certain specialisation of @xmath3 .",
    ".2 cm * 4 . *",
    "we conclude this introduction by describing the main properties obtained for the invariants .",
    "as explained before , they follow quite directly from a precise understanding of the isomorphism , and are expressed easily in terms of the basic invariants defined here .",
    "the main results are :    * for @xmath6 and a non - empty subset @xmath7 , the corresponding invariants coincide with invariants corresponding to @xmath12 and the full set @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we only have to consider the full sets @xmath11 for different @xmath6 . *",
    "further , given a number @xmath0 of connected components of a link , the invariants corresponding to @xmath11 are zero if @xmath14 .",
    "so , given @xmath0 , we only have to consider @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , with the comparison results explained in paragraph * 3 * , it is easy to deduce the similar properties for invariants obtained via juyumaya ",
    "lambropoulou approach .",
    "the first item remains true as it is .",
    "the second item results in an explicit formula expressing , if @xmath14 , the invariants corresponding to @xmath11 in terms of the invariants corresponding to @xmath13 with @xmath16 .",
    "specialising @xmath17 to the appropriate values and restricting to classical links , we recover with the first item a result of @xcite .",
    "the second item in this case was proved only for @xmath18 also in @xcite .",
