    "based on studies of the morphology - density relation in clusters ( dressler 1980 ) and groups ( wilman et al . 2009 ) , it has been suggested that lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies may be the descendants of spirals that have undergone some evolutionary process ( e.g. ram pressure stripping , galaxy harrassment , gas starvation and/or mergers ) .",
    "recent investigations of s0s have studied their metallicity gradients ( bedregal et al .",
    "2011 ) , tully - fisher relation ( bedregal , aragon - salamanca & merrifield 2006 ) and stellar populations ( aragon - salamanca , bedregal & merrifield 2006 ) . however , the origin of s0s is still a subject of much debate ( e.g. kormendy & bender 2012 ) . the internal kinematics of galaxies are a key tool to understanding their structure and formation histories , and s0s are no exception .",
    "for example , the kinematics will be largely unaffected if s0s were formerly spirals that have been simply stripped of gas or if they were involved in a relatively minor merger .",
    "although half of the stellar mass within a galaxy lies within one effective radius ( r@xmath3 ) , more than 90% of the _ total _ mass and angular momentum does not ( romanowsky & fall 2012 ) .",
    "thus in order to examine the internal kinematics and total mass of early - type galaxies one must probe well beyond 1 r@xmath3 .",
    "elliptical and s0 ( early - type ) galaxies often lack the significant quantities of extended hi gas commonly found in spirals , so the kinematic tracers are the galaxy starlight itself , planetary nebulae ( pne ) and globular clusters ( gcs ) .    using the underlying starlight of a galaxy to probe its stellar kinematics is perhaps the preferred method , however the surface brightness of a galaxy declines rapidly with increasing radius so it is very difficult to obtain high quality spectra beyond a few effective radii without a large investment of 8m - class telescope time ( coccato et al .",
    "2010 ) or using deep single pointings ( weijmans et al .",
    "pne and gcs have the advantage that they are ubiquitous in the halos of early - type galaxies out to large galactocentric radii ( 510 r@xmath3 ) .",
    "although there have been several studies of pne and gc system kinematics in early - type galaxies , very few studies have directly compared them to each other , or to results from galaxy starlight over a common radial range .",
    "luminous pne are the end product of low mass stars .",
    "however , there is still debate as to whether they arise from normal single - star evolutionary processes or from mass transfer in a binary star system ( ciardullo et al .",
    "2005 ) in the former case , the pne observed in early - type galaxies would have an age of @xmath01.5 gyr , and in the latter case they could be as old as 10 gyr .",
    "coccato et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that the radial surface density of pne follows the galaxy starlight in early - type galaxies and that they are useful probes of galaxy kinematics .",
    "however , ellipticals with embedded thick disks and s0 galaxies may contain two subpopulations of pne , one associated with the disk and one with the bulge , as seen for spiral galaxies ( nolthenius & ford 1987 ; hurley - keller et al . 2004 ) .",
    "not accounting for the different kinematics of these distinct pne subpopulations could lead to misleading results as illustrated recently by cortesi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the lenticular galaxy ngc 1023 .",
    "furthermore , dekel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that an intermediate - aged population of pne may have ` contaminated ' the pne velocity dispersions of some galaxies in the early - type sample of romanowsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and hence impacted the resulting mass analysis .",
    "the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of all large galaxies , irrespective of hubble type , generally consist of two subpopulations  blue ( or metal - poor ) and red ( or metal - rich ) . both of these subpopulations are thought to have ages @xmath4 10 gyr and hence trace old stellar populations ( for a review of gc system properties see brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "the blue subpopulation is associated with galaxy halos ( forte et al .",
    "2005 ; forbes et al . 2012 ) whereas the red subpopulation has been shown to share many properties with the spheroid / bulge stars of early - type galaxies ( strader et al .",
    "2011 ; forbes et al .",
    "2012 ) , including their kinematics ( pota et al .",
    "we note that the association of red gcs with the bulge and not with a thin disk component extends to spiral galaxies , including our own ( minniti 1995 ; cote 1999 ) and the sombrero ( forbes , brodie & larsen 2001 ) .    to better understand the issues discussed above",
    "it is important to directly compare different kinematic tracers for the same galaxy .",
    "here we combine starlight , pne and gc data for an archetype lenticular galaxy ngc 2768 and directly compare these different kinematic tracers in the same galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is a nearby , near edge - on s0 ( sandage , tammann & van den bergh 1981 ) , although we note that it was originally classified as an e6 in the rc3 catalogue .",
    "according to wikland et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is it an isolated galaxy however it has also been classified as part of the lyon group of galaxies ( lgg ) 167 ( garcia 1993 ) .",
    "it reveals ionised gas and a minor axis dust lane ( kim 1989 ) .",
    "the central ionised gas and stars are known to have different kinematics ( fried & illingworth 1994 ) suggesting an external origin for the gas .",
    "ngc 2768 is a rare example of an early - type galaxy with detectable co emission ( wikland et al .",
    "1995 ) and the host of a calcium - rich supernova type ib ( filippenko & chornock 2000 ) .",
    "the effective radius of the galaxy is 1.06 arcmin ( proctor et al .",
    "2009 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2011 ) . for a distance of 21.8 mpc ( cappellari et al .",
    "2011 ) , this corresponds to 6.7 kpc .",
    "using a new technique to extract integrated kinematic information of the underlying galaxy starlight from a multi - slit spectrograph , proctor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented 2d stellar kinematics for ngc 2768 out to @xmath03 r@xmath3 .",
    "here we have carried out a re - analysis of the proctor et al .",
    "galaxy data after re - defining the sky scaling index continuum passbands to avoid any strong spectral features associated with the galaxy , as well as any skylines in order to refine the sky subtraction ( see foster et al .",
    "2009 for more details ) .",
    "the resulting velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are similar to those published in proctor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . the total number of positions with stellar kinematics available are 104 and our full dataset is given in table 1 of the appendix .",
    "velocity data for 315 pne in ngc 2768 were acquired using the pn.s spectrograph ( douglas et al .",
    "2002 ) in 2007 and are available at : www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/pns/   details of the data reduction procedure and analysis can be found in cortesi et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 in prep . ) .",
    "following coccato et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a uniform magnitude cut has been applied and radial incompleteness tests carried out .",
    "thus each bin of the pne surface density distribution is complete to a given magnitude and has been statistically corrected for any radial incompleteness .",
    "all are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the pne data reach out to @xmath05r@xmath3 .",
    "the radial surface density distribution and velocity data for gcs comes from the imaging and spectroscopy of pota et al .",
    "briefly , imaging from hst allows us to model and subtract the galaxy light , and hence detect gcs in the galaxy inner regions with little or no radial incompleteness .",
    "the resulting surface density distribution for over 500 gcs is a combination of hst data in the inner regions and subaru data in the outer regions , with a background level subtracted .",
    "blue and red gcs were separated according to the local minimum of their bimodal colour distribution , i.e. at r  z = 0.56 ( pota et al . 2012 ) .",
    "follow - up keck spectroscopy returned 112 kinematically - confirmed blue and red gcs ( pota et al .",
    "the blue gcs , associated with galaxy halos ( forbes et al .",
    "2012 ) , were found not to rotate ( pota et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    "we only consider further the 62 gcs from the red subpopulation .",
    "for these gcs the mean velocity is 1353 @xmath5 3 kms @xmath6 in excellent agreement with the galaxy systemic velocity of 1353 km s @xmath6 ( cappellari et al .",
    "the red gcs reach out to @xmath04 r@xmath3 and we henceforth assume they are all associated with the bulge of the galaxy ."
