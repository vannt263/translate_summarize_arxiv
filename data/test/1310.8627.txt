    "the rapid pace of extrasolar planet discovery in recent years has provided detailed statistical data about the distribution of planets in our galaxy .",
    "one of the many surprises in these data is the large number of planets with significant eccentricity measured through the radial velocity ( rv ) method @xcite , particularly in those planets orbiting beyond @xmath0 au , where tidal damping is inefficient .",
    "in contrast , the planets in our own solar system ( aside from mercury ) have low - eccentricity orbits . while eccentricity has been primarily measured through rv , eccentricity can also be inferred for the many exoplanets discovered through the transit method by utilizing transit timing variations ( ttvs ) @xcite and through the so - called ` photoeccentric effect ' on the transit lightcurve @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently showed through a comparison of orbital and transit timescales that the statistical eccentricity distribution of the planets detected by the _ kepler _ spacecraft may be similar to the distributions of those that have direct rv measurements of their eccentricity , however @xcite point out that this depends on the uncertain stellar radii given for the kepler sample , particularly for smaller stars .",
    "@xcite also showed that the mean eccentricity of _ kepler _ planet candidates increases with increasing planet size plateauing above neptune - sized planets ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the planets are thought to have migrated into their present orbits .",
    "migration processes fall into two broad classes , planet - disk interactions @xcite , where planets migrate smoothly through the disk ; and few - body interactions , where planets are moved inwards through interaction with perturbing or scattering bodies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "multi - body dynamical processes have been studied intensely , in part to explain the presence of hot jupiter systems that were found by early rv observations .",
    "however , nearly a third of the likely planet candidates found by the _ kepler _",
    "observatory are thought to be in co - planar multi - planet systems @xcite , indicating that their evolution was likely dominated by disk interaction .",
    "the results of disk migration also provide the initial conditions of the planet locations and eccentricity distribution for the multi - body interactions that take place after the disk has dissipated . given an initial distribution of sufficiently non - zero eccentricities ( @xmath3 ) , @xcite showed that dynamical relaxation of the planetary systems could explain the eccentricity distribution of higher eccentricity systems .",
    "migration driven by planet - disk interactions has been investigated as a means to excite eccentricity in migrating planets .",
    "disk resonances exchange both energy and angular momentum between a planet and the disk , modifying the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the planet . certain resonances tend to pump eccentricity , while others tend to damp it .",
    "it is generally thought that the net effect of disk - planet interactions is to damp eccentricity . for small planets ,",
    "this is almost certainly the case @xcite . for giant planets , @xcite and @xcite suggested that saturation of the eccentricity - damping first - order corotation resonances could lead to eccentricity growth of planets able to clear a gap in the disk .",
    "however , recent numerical studies @xcite have not seen such saturation in simulations , finding that eccentricity is damped for giant planets except for extreme cases where the gap is wide enough to avoid the corotation resonances entirely .",
    "entropy gradients in the disk can modify corotation resonances through baroclinic effects .",
    "previous studies on the effects of entropy gradients in non - barotropic disks have focussed on the primary ( co - orbital ) co - rotation resonance , numerically solving for the response of the disk @xcite , and the effect of the non - barotropic non - linear horseshoe torques on type i migration of small planets embedded in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "these non - barotropic effects can allow halting or even reversal of migration for certain systems .",
    "@xcite recently utilized the numerical fitting formulae from @xcite to predict the effect of stellar illumination on migration of small embedded planets .    in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we go beyond these previous studies by deriving a fully analytic form for the linear non - barotropic corotation torques , for both primary and first - order corotation resonances . here",
    ", we apply these results to eccentricity excitation in disks in which the gap formed by a migrating planet is heated by stellar irradiation .",
    "the general picture is as follows . as a gap clearing planet",
    "perturbs the disk , lindblad resonances excite the planet s eccentricity while non co - orbital corotation torques damp its eccentricity . in a barotropic disk , the damping dominates unless the gap is very large .",
    "we show here that the entropy gradients at the edge of an irradiated gap act to reduce the non - barotropic corotation torque , allowing the eccentricity - exciting lindblad resonances to dominate .",
    "the requirement for the gap to be irradiated in order to enable eccentricity growth in the disk offers a potential explanation for the lack of eccentric planets at intermediate orbital periods around low metallicity stars found by @xcite . in low metallicity disks , heating of the disk at the dust sublimation radius",
    "may lead to shadowing of the disk in the region @xmath0@xmath4 @xcite , causing eccentricity damping in this `` eccentricity valley '' region .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the nature of non - barotropic corotation torques and their dependence on background entropy gradient . in section 3",
    "we review the mechanism of eccentricity damping for giant planets in barotropic disks . in section 4",
    "we show that for reasonable assumptions about the disk structure and insolation the resulting non - barotropic torques can lead to eccentricity excitation . in section 5 ,",
    "we demonstrate how the `` eccentricity valley '' may be explained by eccentricity damping and excitation in self - shadowed and fully irradiated disks respectively .",
    "finally we discuss the implication of our results in section 6 .",
    "a quantity that plays an important role in the determination of the corotation torque is the vortensity , @xmath5 , ( also known as the potential or specific vorticity ) where @xmath6 is the z - component of a fluid s vorticity .",

    "the disk is assumed to be barotropic , such that pressure is only a function of density , @xmath13 .",
    "this causes the lines of constant @xmath12 and @xmath11 to be parallel for any perturbations , such that the baroclinic term is zero .",

    "we have shown that the threshold is easily exceeded in the flared structure obtained for a standard viscous disk model by placing the material surrounding the gap in radiative balance with the starlight .",
    "our starlight transfer calculations are axisymmetric and thus do not include the planet s wakes , but do capture the gross shape of the disk surface under vertical hydrostatic balance . thus we expect that starlight heating could have enabled many planets to gain eccentricity through disk interaction , rather than solely through later post - disk dynamical interactions as previously thought . note that eccentricity driving requires the gap around the giant planet to be sufficiently cleared that the co - orbital lindblad torques are suppressed , since these would dominate the eccentricity evolution for an embedded planet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) .",
    "the eccentricity driving has important implications for the inferred dynamical histories of giant planets in the currently known rv sample , and for the relative importance of orbital evolution due to the disk versus strong dynamical interactions , such as planet - planet scattering or the kozai mechanism .",
    "such disk interactions may be the source of the isolated eccentric giant planets .",
    "for the _ kepler _ sample , the inferred mean eccentricity dependence on the planet size @xcite , rising with @xmath101 and plateauing above @xmath102 , may be consistent with an eccentricity growth process being tied to gap clearing conditions .",
    "the eccentricity distribution at the end of the protoplanetary disk phase also provides the initial conditions for multi - planet interactions as discussed by @xcite , and further may help to explain the excess of planets with low , but non - zero eccentricity that are not explained by these interactions .",
    "we have suggested that the `` eccentricity valley '' for planets between @xmath0 and @xmath1 au around low - metallicity host stars @xcite may be explained by noting that this range also corresponds to the region shadowed by the dust rim that is formed when an optically thin gas interior to the dust sublimation point allows direct insolation of the dust wall at the sublimation radius . in the self - shadowed region between @xmath0 and @xmath103",
    "au the disk interactions should damp eccentricity , resulting in circular orbits . for higher metallicities , and higher accretion rates , the flow interior to the dust sublimation radius can become optically thick , preventing direct insolation from puffing up the dust rim , and causing the shadowed region to disappear .",
    "such fully - illuminated disks may produce eccentric planets in the `` eccentricity valley '' region , as is seen for systems with [ fe / h ] @xmath104 .",
    "one might expect the extent of the shadowed region to decrease smoothly with increasing metallicity , as the height of the disk rim varies .",
    "intriguingly , a hint of this may be present in the lower envelope of the planet distribution shown in figure [ eccdata1 ] .",
    "we have only studied the linear growth of eccentricity in a system with a heated gap . to fully understand the eccentricity evolution of planetary systems and follow the eccentricity growth into the non - linear regime , detailed numerical simulations",
    "are needed that include non - barotropic equations of state and the effect of stellar illumination on the gap .",
    "additional modeling of the dust rim and the shadowed region of protoplanetary disks , and the geometric effects of a planetary gap in these regions is also needed to confirm if the `` eccentricity valley '' arises due to self - shadowing and non - barotropic torques in fully - illuminated disks .",
    "note that accretion heating is neglected in the two radiative transfer and hydrostatic balance calculations shown in figure [ tsigmaplot ] , as is shock heating associated with the planet s wake .",
    "starlight will modify the corotation torques only when the gap is heated by illumination at least as much as the gap edges are heated by accretion and shocks .",
    "this would depend on the accretion rate at the end of the disk phase , and the gap opening dynamics and resulting structure .",
    "it will also be important to study the expected entropy gradients in disks that are not irradiated or in regions of irradiated disks in which accretion heating dominates .",
