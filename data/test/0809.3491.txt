    "in the recent years a number of observations have been carried out that lead to a precise knowledge of the cosmological evolution .",
    "cosmological observations like abundances of galaxy cluster large scale redshift surveys [ 1 ] , angular power spectrum of cmbr [ 2 ] , and baryon oscilllations [ 3 ] suggest that the universe is nearly flat and almost 73 % of the matter in the form of dark energy .",
    "further the magnitude redshift surveys of type ia supernovae indicates the universe has recently entered a phase of accelerating phase of expansion [ 4 ] . on the otherhand it is generally accepted that our universe might have also emerged from an accelerating phase in the past .",
    "thus one of the essential ingradients in modern cosmology is inflation .",
    "however , inflation can not be accommodated in a perfect fluid assumption in the framework of einstein general theory of relativity ( gtr ) . this led to explore gravitational theories with a modification of the matter sector or the gravitational sector .",
    "it is known that the early inflation may be realized in a semiclassical theory of gravity where matter is described by quantum fields [ 5 ] .",
    "starobinsky also obtained inflationary solution considering a curvature squared term in the einstein - hilbert action [ 6 ] long before the advent of inflation was known .",
    "however , the efficacy of inflation is known only after the seminal work of guth who first employed the phase transition mechanism to accommodate inflation . a large volume of literature appeared with a modification of gravitational sector in which curvature squared terms [ 7 ]",
    "were added to the einstein - hilbert action to realize early inflationary universe scenario . in the case of inflaton field cosmology early inflation may be realized with an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 .",
    "however , an accelerating late universe with barotropic fluid emerges when @xmath2 .",
    "the usual matter fields in the standard model of particle physics unable to accommodate the late accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is a challenging task to formulate a consistent theoretical framework which might accommodate the observational facts .",
    "recent astronomical data when interpreted in the context of bigbang model have provided some interesting information about the composition of the universe .",
    "it is beleived that the universe is dominated by a huge amount of dark energy . to accommodate such a huge energy various mechanism",
    "have been proposed during the last few years in order to classify the physical nature of the cosmic fluid [ 8 ] . among the different theories proposed , the single component fluid known as chaplygin gas [ 9 ] with an equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy density and pressure respectively and @xmath6 is a constant , has attracted large interest in cosmology [ 7 ] .",
    "the above equation of state , however , has been conceived in studies of adiabatic fields .",
    "it was used to describe lifting forces on a plane wing in aerodynamic process . in cosmology , although it admits an accelerating universe [ 10 ] , fails to address structure formation and cosmological perturbation power spectrum [ 11 ] .",
    "subsequently , a generalized form of the equation of state ( in short , eos ) @xmath7 with @xmath8 was considered to construct a viable cosmological model [ 12 , 13 ] , which is known as generalized chaplygin gas ( in short , gcg ) in cosmology .",
    "it has two free parameters @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "the fluid behaves initially like dust for small size of the universe .",
    "but at a later epoch the fluid may be described by an equation of state @xmath10 .",
    "it has string connection , the above equation of state can be obtained from the nambu - goto action for a d - brane moving in a ( d+2)-dimensional space - time in the light cone parametrization [ 14 ] .",
    "recently a new form of equation of state @xmath11 has been considered to study the dark energy content of the universe [ 15 ] .",
    "consequently a three parameter modified form of the equation of state for chaplygin gas is more important .",
    "therefore , we consider an equation of state of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an equation of state parameter and @xmath14 is a constant , which is termed as modified chaplygin gas ( in short , mcg ) [ 16 ]",
    ". an interesting feature of the mcg equation of state is that in the early universe when the size of the universe @xmath15 was small , it behaved like a barotropic fluid ( if one considers @xmath16 it corresponds to radiation and @xmath17 it corresponds to matter ) but at a later epoch it behaves as a cosmological constant which can be fitted to a @xmath18cdm model .",
    "recently , the thermal equation of state of the mcg is studied [ 17 ] and it is found that the mcg may cool down through thermodynamic processes without facing any critical point or phase transition .",
    "they noted the following constraints for a realistic solution on the values of the parameters : ( i ) for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ( ii ) for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ( iii ) for @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "barrow [ 18 ] has outlined a method to fit the chaplygin gas in the frw universe . in a flat friedmann model",
    "it is shown [ 10 ] that the generalized chaplygin gas may be equivalently described in terms of a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field @xmath25 .",
    "[ 19 ] using the above scheme obtained the corresponding homogeneous scalar field @xmath26 and the corresponding potential @xmath27 which can be used to obtain a viable cosmological model with the generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "thus it is important to look for the field and the relevant potential for the modified chaplygin gas , which will be discussed in the section 3 .",
    "recently , another interesting topic , namely holographic principle [ 20 , 21 ] is incorporated in cosmology [ 22 - 25 ] to track the dark energy content of the universe following the work of cohen _ et al . _",
    "holographic principle is a speculative conjecture about quantum gravity theories proposed by gt hooft [ 27 ] .",
    "the idea has been subsequently promoted by susskind and his coworkers [ 20 ] claiming that all the information contained in a spatial volume may be represented by a theory that lives on the boundary of that space . for a given finite region of space",
    "it may contain matter and energy within it .",
    "if this energy suppresses a critical density then the region collapses to a black hole .",
    "a black hole is known theoretically to have an entropy which is proportional to its surface area of its event horizon .",
    "a black hole event horizon encloses a volume , thus a more massive black hole have larger event horizon and encloses larger volume .",
    "the most massive black hole that can fit in a given region is the one whose event horizon corresponds exactly to the boundary of the given region under consideration .",
    "the maximal limit of entropy for an ordinary region of space is directly proportional to the surface area of the region and not to its volume .",
    "thus , according to holographic principle , under suitable conditions all the information about a physical system inside a spatial region is encoded in the boundary .",
    "the basic idea of a holographic dark energy in cosmology is that the saturation of the entropy bound may be related to an unknown ultra - violet ( uv ) scale @xmath18 to some known comological scale in order to enable it to find a viable formula for the dark energy which may be quantum gravity in origin and it is characterized by @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of uv - infra red ( ir ) connection from the covariant entropy bound leads to a universe dominated by blackhole states . according to cohen _",
    "[ 26 ] for any state in the hilbert space with energy @xmath28 , the corresponding schwarzschild radius @xmath29 , may be less than the ir cut off value @xmath30 ( where @xmath30 is a cosmological scale ) .",
    "it is possible to derive a relation between the uv cutoff @xmath31 and the ir cutoff which eventually leads to a constraint @xmath32 [ 26 ] where @xmath33 is the energy density corresponding to dark energy characterized by @xmath34 , @xmath35 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath36 is a parameter in the theory .",
    "the holographic dark energy density is @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "it is known that the present acceleration may be described if @xmath39 .",
    "if one considers @xmath40 it gives @xmath41 .",
    "a holographic cosmological constant model based on hubble scale as ir cut off does not permit accelerating universe .",
    "it is also examined [ 22 ] that the holographic dark energy model based on the particle horizon as the ir cutoff even does not work to get an accelerating universe .",
    "an alternative model of dark energy using particle horizon in closed model is also proposed [ 26 ] .",
    "recently , li [ 23 ] has obtained an accelerating universe considering event horizon as the cosmological scale .",
    "the model is consistent with the cosmological observations .",
    "thus to have a model consistent with observed universe one should adopt the covaiant entropy bound and choose @xmath30 to be the event horizon .",
    "the motivation of the paper is two folds ( i ) to explore an equivalent scalar field representation corresponding to the mcg in cosmology and ( ii ) to explore an equivalent holographic dark energy field , considering the event horizon as the cosmological scale in a non - flat universe .",
    "we obtain holographic description of the mcg dark energy in frw universe and reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the scalar field which describes the mcg cosmology .",
    "we consider both flat and non - flat universe here as it is not yet decided .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , the relevant field equation with modified chaplygin gas in frw universe is presented ; in sec .",
    "3 we present an equivalent field theoretic representation of mcg by a scalar field , constructing the corresponding potential , in sec . 4 , we suggest a correspondence between holographic dark energy fields with mcg . in sec . 5 ,",
    "squared speed of sound for holographic dark energy is evaluated for a closed universe i.e. , @xmath42 to study the stability of the field .",
