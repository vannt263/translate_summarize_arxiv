    "anderson localization  @xcite of electronic states in a disordered system is a path breaking observation that has extended its realm well beyond the electronic properties of disordered solid materials , and has been found out to be ubiquitous in a wide variety of systems such as the photonic  @xcite , phononic  @xcite , polaronic  @xcite , or plasmonic lattices  @xcite to name a few .",
    "artificial , tailor made geometries developed using the improved fabrication and lithographic techniques have been instrumental in testing the validity of the basic theory of exciton localization in presence of disorder .",
    "examples include the direct observation of localization of matter waves in recent times  @xcite .",
    "localization is a result of quantum interference that has the strongest manifestation in one dimension where all the single particle states exhibit an exponential decay of amplitude as one moves away from a particular lattice point . for dimensions beyond one ,",
    "the states retain their characteristic decay in amplitude , with the addition of a possibility of a metal - insulator transition in three dimensions .",
    "the results have been substantiated by calculations of the localization length  @xcite , density of states  @xcite and their multi - fractality  @xcite .",
    "extensive work has also revealed the intricacies of the single parameter scaling hypothesis  @xcite , its validity  @xcite or , variance  @xcite , and even violation  @xcite in low dimensional systems within a tight binding approximation .",
    "the studies have subsequently been consolidated by direct experimental measurements of conductance distribution in quasi - one dimensional gold wires  @xcite .    in the last couple of decades",
    "variations in the canonical cases of anderson localization have surfaced , particularly , within a tight binding description .",
    "resonant tunnelling of electronic states has been shown to arise even in a one dimensional disordered system as a consequence of certain special kinds of positional correlation  @xcite .",
    "discrete energy levels corresponding to _ extended eigenfunctions _",
    "@xcite , appear within a typical point spectrum exhibited by the randomly disordered lattices rendering the two - terminal transport completely ballistic at special values of the fermi level .",
    "such results are common even to infinite quasicrystalline lattices in one dimension where , the self similar character of the chain really allows an infinite number of unscattered ( extended ) eigenfunctions despite the absence of any translational invariance  @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "rather unusual , yet meaningful question could be , is it possible to engineer , in a controlled fashion , an _ absolutely continuous _ portion in the energy spectrum of non - translationally invariant systems with the help of some kind positional correlations ?",
    "the existence of real continuous bands are reported recently in quasi one dimensional or two dimensional systems only with diagonal disorder  @xcite .",
    "we thus have a partial answer to the question , and it remains to be seen whether such bands of extended eigenfunctions can be generated and controlled with off - diagonal disorder are well .",
    "we address this issue with respect to quasiperiodically ordered geometries . in this communication",
    "we show that , in quasi - one dimensional ladder networks with off - diagonal quasi - periodic order it is possible to engineer absolutely continuous bands of energy eigenvalues .",
    "we specifically work with the fibonacci quasiperiodic order , though the observation is by no means , restricted to them .",
    "ladder networks within the framework of tight binding model have already been exploited to gain insight into charge transport in dna  @xcite , to unravel interesting physics related to polymer structures and ployacene lattice topology  @xcite .",
    "comparatively speaking , controlled generation of absolutely continuous portions in the energy spectrum of the ladder networks , disordered or quasi - periodic , still remains to be explored .",
    "if it works then such an effort may open up new physics , or allow one to explore the possibility of devising novel low dimensional filter networks .",
    "the central result of this paper is that , one can _ create _ absolutely continuous subbands in the electronic spectrum of such quasi 1-d systems , by attaching a single quantum dot ( qd ) from one side to a selected set of lattice points in every strand of the ladder .",
    "we discuss the results explicitly in terms of fibonacci quasi - periodic two and three arm ladder network models using a tight binding hamiltonian and a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method .",
    "we also investigate whether a crossover in the fundamental character of the eigenfunctions , going from a typical _ critical _ nature to a bloch - like _ extended _ character can be engineered .",
    "as will be shown , this indeed turns out to be quite a possibility in the case of the quasi - periodic ladder network ( qpln ) , particularly when the number of strands ` @xmath0 ' in the transverse direction increases .",
    "the results hold even for an off - diagonally disordered ladder where a re - entrant insulator - metal - insulator transition becomes feasible .",
    "the system is described by a tight binding hamiltonian , and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ lattice1 ] .",
    "the on - site potential at every lattice point is kept constant , while the nearest neighbor hopping integral along the arms of the ladder assumes two values dictated by the growth rule of the desired quasi - periodic sequence .",
    "the electron can tunnel between the arms of the ladder by hopping from one site to its corresponding site on the other arm through the hopping integral @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice1 ] ) .",
    "the sites marked by @xmath2 in each arm of the ladder is coupled to a single level qd  @xcite attached from one side .",
    "the qd couples to every @xmath2-site via a hopping integral @xmath3 .",
    "there is no positional correlation , short range or long range in the conventional sense  @xcite .",
    "attachment of qd s from a side can quench the conductance of a linear chain  @xcite , but an array of qd s in a ladder can have reverse effect , as will be seen",
    ".    we will show in a completely analytical way that , for a particular relationship between the nearest neighbor hopping integrals along the ladder strand and the qd - strand coupling @xmath3 , and for a special value of the qd potential , we get _ absolutely continuous subbands _ in the spectrum .",
    "this immediately raises a non - trivial issue that , the nature of the electronic spectrum and the eigenstates over a _ continuous range of eigenvalues _ can become sensitive to the _ numerical values _ of the hamiltonian parameters  a fact that is not commonly observed in the conventional anderson localization problem .",
    "the full spectrum turns out to be an admixture of conventional _ critical eigenstates _",
    ", characteristics of a fibonacci quasiperiodic chain , and absolutely continuous parts , giving rise to the possibility of a _ phase transition _ , particularly when the system grows in the transverse direction .",
    "our results are analytically exact .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the hamiltonian and the basic working principle for the two and three strand quasi - periodic ladders constructed following a fibonacci sequence . along with this , the real space renormalization scheme to obtain the energy spectrum and to judge the character of the single particle states is also presented . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we present a result for the two terminal transmission coefficient of a finite sized qpln , and in section  [ sec4 ] we draw our conclusion .",

    "the complete spectrum of the quasi @xmath29-d system of @xmath0 strands is then obtained by convolving the spectra of the individual linear chains .",

    "the contribution to the full spectrum coming from this separate chain will be two absolutely continuous sub - bands . with the potential of the qd set at @xmath118 ,",
    "the two other decoupled strands represent two different fibonacci chains in the mixed model .",
    "the spectrum resulting from each of them will remain fragmented cantor type .",
    "the overall spectrum , as we now have known , will be a convolution of the three .",
    "the absolutely continuous portions will still hold their positions in the main spectrum , and will be flanked by the spiky , fragmented parts characteristics of critical eigenstates of a fibonacci lattice ( fig  [ 3stranddos ] ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions belonging to the continuous sub - bands will , needless to say , be of extended character .",
    ".,width=264 ]    one needs to appreciate that each spectrum offered separately by the decoupled @xmath51- and @xmath114-strands will have different  band - centres \" around which the singular continuous spectra of the individual decoupled fibonacci chain will spread out . with an @xmath0-strand ladder model , there will be @xmath119 such centers from the @xmath119 decoupled strands around which cantor set energy eigenvalues will be distributed , the remaining strand contributing the absolutely continuous sub - bands .",
    "the centres will be densely populated around the outer edge of the continuous sub - bands as @xmath120 .",
    "thus , with increasing number of strands there is a possibility of observing a smooth critical to extended state crossover in the spectrum of such quasi @xmath29-d aperiodic ladder models .",
    "clearly , the argument prevails even if we have an @xmath0-strand off diagonally disordered ladder network .",
    "the side coupled qd s with appropriately tuned potential one can then expect a re - entrant _ insulator - metal _ transition .    before leaving this discussion , it is pertinent to mention that , the commutaion of transfer matrices leading to a complete , energy independent delocalization of electronic states have been reported recently in certain special examples of quasi - one dimensional lattices  @xcite .",
    "but , those systems do not open up any possibility of an insulator - metal transition , in the current spirit of the work . at the same time",
    ", it is useful to note that , the commutivity of transfer matrices has been used in the past to unravel discrete unscattered eigenstates in an array of quantum wells  @xcite or a disordered distribution of pschl - teller potential  @xcite .",
    "the difference with the present communication and these two latter references lies in the energy - independent character of the matrix - commutation that plays the key role .",
    "we now present partial results ( to save space ) for the two terminal transmission coefficient of a finite two strand ladder without decoupling it .",
    "no change of basis is made , and the full finite qpln is treated within the rsrg scheme .",
    "the basic working formula is already elaborated in the existing literature  @xcite .",
    "the ladder is clamped between two semi - infinite perfectly ordered leads ( viz .",
    ", the source and the drain ) at any two extremities ( fig .  [ lattice3 ] ) .",
    "the leads are characterized by uniform on - site potential @xmath121 and nearest neighbor hopping integral @xmath122 .",
    "the portion of the ladder clamped between the leads is renormalized to bring it down to a _ diatomic molecule _ , and the transmission coefficient is easily obtained  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is standard and to save space again , we do not provide the details .    it should be appreciated that , the precise details of the transmission coefficient definitely depends on which points in the ladder the leads are attached to .",
    "only one result is shown here in which the two semi - infinite ordered leads are connected to the extreme points of the upper strand of a @xmath123-th generation fibonacci ladder having @xmath124 bonds in each arm .",
    "-th generation two - strand fibonacci ladder network under resonance condition .",
    "both the incoming and outgoing leads , viz .",
    ", the source and the drain are connected in the upper strand . system parameters chosen are @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , and the lead parameters are @xmath121 and @xmath122.,width=264 ]    one needs to appreciate that , even in the absence of any attached qd , a two strand finite qpln can exhibit high transmission spikes with @xmath125 close to unity .",
    "this normally results from the finite size of the system , as well as from the fact that a ladder network consists of loops that brings in a flavor of long range connection , and may well be responsible for quantum interference leading to high transmittivity at selected values of electron - energy .",
    "also , the attachment to the leads , and the difference between the hopping integral in the lead and that in the bulk of the system give rise to strong scattering effects at the contacts , affecting the overall transmission of the qpln system .",
    "therefore , the results obtained from a finite size analysis should be carefully compared with the predictions which come from the anatomy of an infinite system .    nevertheless , the existence of the continuous parts in the energy spectrum of the infinite system is already showing up in the enhanced value of the transmission coefficient at appropriate values of the electron energy as can be seen in fig .  [ transport ] .",
    "the apparent drop to close to zero value at certain regions even within the continuous zone is due to the scale at which the transmission coefficient is shown here .",
    "however , the transmission coefficient exhibits wide fluctuations owing to the quasiperiodic nature of network .",
    "the effect of quantum interference is manifestly observed here .",
    "the finite value of the transmission coefficient even beyond the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum is due to the finite size of the system , and gets lower and lower , and the spectrum gets more spiky with increasing system size .",
    "also , one can anticipate eigenstates with their ` localization length ' much larger compared to the size of the system as considered in the present calculation .",
    "we have shown that fibonacci quasi - periodic ladder networks , where quasi - periodic order is introduced in the distribution of bonds , keeping the potential at every vertex same , are capable of producing absolutely continuous portions in their energy spectra .",
    "this requires the attachment of quantum dots from one side to a special set of sites in each arm of the ladder .",
    "a suitable adjustment of the dot potential , together with the dot - backbone coupling can generate absolutely continuous energy sub - bands , decorated at the flanks by the usual critical states  a characteristic of quasi - periodic lattices .",
    "apart from opening up the possibility of engineering the transport of excitons in such multi - strand systems , a very basic issue of anderson localization is reviewed .",
    "it seems that , the existence of localized eigenstates in similar disordered ladder networks may strongly depend on the numerical values of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the analysis is carried over to other quasi - periodically ordered systems , such as the copper mean chain , the aperiodic thue morse chain and even to the disordered ladder networks with locally and non - locally coupled dots .",
    "the conditions for the existence of a continuum in the energy spectrum becomes much more non - trivial in such systems .",
    "these issues will be reported in a forthcoming article .",
