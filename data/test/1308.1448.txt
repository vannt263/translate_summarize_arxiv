    "in a recent paper @xcite , one of us ( sla ) analyzed the consequences of introducing gravitation into the framework of trace dynamics pre - quantum mechanics @xcite , assuming the metric to be described as usual by a classical field .",
    "the focus of @xcite was on deriving an induced effective action describing trace dynamics modifications to gravitation , applying it to the cosmological robertson - walker metric , and beginning an application to the spherically symmetric case .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to continue the latter , with a detailed investigation of modifications to spherically symmetric vacuum solutions .    before proceeding with this ,",
    "however , we give a brief introduction to the basic ideas of trace dynamics pre - quantum mechanics . a book - length exposition of trace dynamics",
    "is given in [ 2 ] , with a synopsis as section 2 of [ 1 ] ; readers wanting more detail than given here can refer to these references .",
    "the fundamental idea of trace dynamics is to set up a pre - quantum theory , based on non - commuting matrix- or operator- valued dynamical variables which have no a priori commutation relations ; for example , canonical coordinates @xmath2 at different spatial points are not assumed to commute .",
    "the lagrangian for this system is taken as the trace of an operator lagrangian constructed as a polynomial in the @xmath2 and their time derivatives , and using just cyclic permutation under the trace , one finds that the euler lagrange equations for the trace lagrangian are operator equations of motion , without invoking canonical quantization .",
    "this system is more general than the usual quantum field theory , and the rest of the trace dynamics program shows that with certain approximations ( basically a decoupling of high energy from low energy degrees of freedom ) , quantum field theory with unitary state evolution emerges as the thermodynamics of the underlying trace dynamics system . in trace dynamics , state vector reduction in measurement is a physical process , and is the only low energy non - local and non - unitary remnant of the underlying operator dynamics .      in the discussion of the book",
    "[ 2 ] , gravity was not included . in the paper [ 1 ] ,",
    "gravity was included in the form of a classical background metric @xmath9 , and a trace dynamics - induced correction to the usual einstein action was defined as the average of the trace dynamics pre - quantum variable action over the canonical ensemble .",
    "the structure of this correction was analyzed under the assumption that the pre - quantum matter fields are massless , and so admit a weyl scaling invariance when the metric is rescaled .",
    "this , together with three space rotational and general coordinate invariance , implies that the induced correction to the einstein action for has the following form for non - rotating metrics , to zeroth order in the derivatives of the metric , @xmath10 with @xmath11 a constant and with @xmath12 .",
    "a salient feature of this effective action is that it picks a preferred frame , and thus violates lorentz invariance .",
    "the traditional statement of the principle of relativity is that all inertial frames are physically equivalent , and that there is no way to measure the absolute velocity of an inertial observer .",
    "we now know , since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , that this statement needs modification .",
    "the cmb provides a reference inertial frame , and by measuring the dipole component of the angular variation of the cmb , an observer with a radiometer can infer her absolute velocity with respect to this frame .",
    "such measurements @xcite show that the solar system is moving with a velocity of 369 km / s relative to the cmb .",
    "empirically , we know that the cmb is highly isotropic , to an accuracy of one part in @xmath13 . thus , it is natural to identify the preferred frame picked out by the trace dynamics canonical ensemble , and by the action of eq .",
    ", with the cmb rest frame , since identification with any frame moving with a finite velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame would violate rotational symmetry and spatial isotropy .",
    "calculations using the effective action of eq . must be carried out in the cmb rest frame , with predictions for frames moving with a finite velocity with respect to the cmb frame obtained by applying an appropriate boost to the results of the cmb rest frame calculations .",
    "none of this implies that the physical laws underlying trace dynamics are lorentz violating  they are not  but only reflects the rest frame of the underlying pre - quantum `` fluid '' , the dynamics of which is averaged over by the trace dynamics canonical ensemble .",
    "our assertion , motivated by rotational invariance , is that this rest frame is the same as the rest frame of the cmb , as well as the rest frame of the background galaxies .",
    "there has been an extended discussion in the literature of possible lorentz violating effects , and experimental bounds on them , but to our knowledge these do not take the form of a lorentz violating effective action of the form of eq . .",
    "thus , one motivation of this paper is to study further implications of a new form of preferred frame effect , based on the two assumptions which are used in @xcite but which are more general than the trace dynamics program : ( 1 ) the preferred frame effective action , as a function of the metric , is three space general coordinate invariant ( but not four space general coordinate invariant ) , and ( 2 ) the preferred frame effective action is invariant under weyl rescalings of the metric and matter fields .",
    "we can then rewrite @xmath22 of eq . as @xmath23 which is to be added to the standard einstein - hilbert action @xmath24 to give the total gravitational action @xmath25 varying this action with respect to the spatial metric components @xmath26 gives the modified equations of motion for the spatial components @xmath27 of the einstein tensor ; as discussed in @xcite and as elaborated on below , the equations of motion of the remaining components of the einstein tensor can be inferred by conserving extension using the bianchi identities .    by construction , for the rw metric the modified action of eq .",
    "gives the usual equations of the standard cosmological model .",
    "but for other metrics , it implies different physics than is implied by the usual interpretation of `` dark energy '' as a consequence of a `` bare '' cosmological term , and this offers the possibility of distinguishing between the two interpretations of `` dark energy '' . in particular , for the schwarzschild metric solution of the einstein equations obtained from the usual einstein - hilbert action ,",
    "the effective action @xmath28 diverges as @xmath29 near the schwarzschild radius @xmath30 , suggesting that including this term and solving the resulting modified einstein equations may substantially affect the horizon structure .",
    "thus , a second motivation of this paper is to study places where the two interpretations of dark energy , either as a `` bare '' cosmological constant arising from lorentz invariant vacuum physics , or as a frame - dependent effect of pre - quantum matter fluctuations , give different results . the natural place to start",
    "such a study is in the well - defined arena of spherically symmetric metrics , which was initiated in @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to continue the analysis of the spherically symmetric case , both for static and time dependent metrics , by deriving and solving the differential equations governing spherically symmetric schwarzschild - like solutions in the preferred rest frame for the effective action .",
    "we proceed now to give an outline of the paper , and a brief summary of the principal results . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze the equations in standard polar coordinates , marshalling both analytic and numerical results . in sec .",
    "iii we study the related equations that describe the schwarzschild - like solutions in isotropic coordinates . in sec .",
    "iv we extend our results to the time - dependent case , focussing on the mcvittie ansatz which , as in the static case , can be analyzed by solving ordinary differential equations in a radius - like variable . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the relevance of our results to outstanding issues in black hole physics .",
    "notational conventions and extensions of our discussion are given in appendices .",
    "our results show that , as anticipated , the effective action of eq .",
    "substantially changes the horizon structure . at macroscopic distances @xmath31",
    "cm from the nominal horizon ( with @xmath32 the black hole mass in solar mass units ) the solutions closely approximate the standard schwarzschild form until cosmological distances are reached .",
    "hence we do not expect significant consequences for the astrophysics of stellar and galactic structure . within @xmath33 cm from the nominal horizon , the behavior of @xmath0 changes , with @xmath0 remaining non - vanishing until the internal singularity is reached ;",
    "this could have consequences , still to be explored , for discussions of the black hole `` information paradox '' .",
    "we can conclude little from the internal singularity itself , since here the approximation of neglecting metric derivatives in the effective action of eq .",
    "breaks down . at cosmological distances ,",
    "the static solutions have a physical ( not a coordinate ) singularity , which may be a consequence of using the static metric assumption in a cosmological regime where it does not apply .",
    "introducing time dependence significantly alters the form of the spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "time - dependent solutions in the mcvittie ansatz are very sensitive to initial values and integration details , but subject to uncertainties which we discuss , there may be solutions which have similar horizon behavior to the static case , but in which the large distance physical singularity is pushed out to super - cosmological distances for black hole masses of astrophysical interest .",
    "the standard form for the static , spherically symmetric line element is @xmath34 corresponding to the metric components @xmath35 since we have @xmath36 , we can use the simplified form of the induced action given in eqs . .",
    "substituting @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 varying the spatial components @xmath26 of the metric , while taking @xmath39 , and writing @xmath40 we find from eq . that the spatial components @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 adding this to the variation of the einstein action @xmath43 of eqs . and ,",
    "and equating the total variation to zero , we get the modified einstein equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 with the equation for @xmath47 proportional to that for @xmath45 .",
    "proceeding in an analogous way , one can derive the modified equations for a general axially symmetric metric .",
    "these are given ( but not solved ) in appendix d of the arxiv version of this paper ( arxiv:1308.1448v3 ) .      before proceeding to study eqs .",
    ", we first examine the analogous equations that would be obtained from an ordinary cosmological constant ( that is , eq . with @xmath17 interpreted as the observed cosmological constant @xmath19 ) , which correspond to replacing @xmath62 by unity in eqs .  .",
    "this gives the einstein equations @xmath63 as is well known , this system of equations can be solved by making the ansatz @xmath64 , with @xmath65 a constant , which implies that @xmath66 . substituting this",
    ", the @xmath45 equation reduces to @xmath67 and the @xmath44 equation takes the form @xmath68 differentiating eq . once we get @xmath69 which when subtracted from eq .",
    "just gives @xmath70 times eq . .",
    "hence the ansatz is self - consistent , and it suffices to solve the first order linear equation eq . .",
    "making the conventional choice @xmath71 , and setting the gravitational constant @xmath21 to unity so that the schwarzschild radius becomes @xmath72 , this has its solution the schwarzschild - de - sitter metric , @xmath73 when @xmath74 , the schwarzschild horizon for this metric is at @xmath75 .",
    "there is also a de sitter horizon at @xmath76 , which is a coordinate singularity ( but not a physical singularity , since curvature invariants remain finite there ) . for a detailed discussion of the schwarzschild - de - sitter metric , see gibbons and hawking @xcite , and for an extensive list of references , organized by category , see podolsk @xcite .        often in the literature ,",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath82 functions for the static spherically symmetric metric are rewritten in exponential form as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not restricted to be real - valued ( allowing @xmath79 and @xmath82 to be negative when @xmath87 and @xmath88 develop logarithmic branch cuts , as within the horizon of the standard schwarzschild solution ) . in terms of the functions",
    "@xmath89 , the equation relating @xmath79 to @xmath82 is @xmath90 and the differential equation for @xmath85 is @xmath91      we have not succeeded in finding an analytic general solution to the master equation , but it is easy to find two exact particular solutions .",
    "the first is obtained by noting that @xmath92 and @xmath93 both vanish for @xmath94 with any value of the constant of integration @xmath95 .",
    "hence @xmath96 is an exact particular solution of the master equation , and corresponds to the leading term of the small @xmath97 behavior exhibited below in eq . .",
    "the second is obtained by trying the ansatz @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath97 dependence then cancel out of the master equation , leaving an algebraic equation @xmath99 which simplifies to @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath101 is a purely imaginary - valued particular solution of the master equation .",
    "equation does not play a role in our subsequent analysis , which focuses on physically relevant solutions that are real - valued outside a finite radius . to study such physical general solutions , we resort in the following sections to analytic approximation and numerical methods .        near the schwarzschild metric horizon at @xmath114 , the leading corrections to @xmath79 and @xmath82 are @xmath115 while for large @xmath97 , the corresponding leading corrections are @xmath116      to further analyze the master equation , it is convenient to put it in dimensionless form by scaling out the dimensional constant @xmath19 . defining @xmath117",
    "we find that @xmath118 satisfies the differential equation , with @xmath49 denoting now @xmath119 , @xmath120 this equation can be rewritten in the form @xmath121 which exhibits the pole structure of the coefficients .",
    "an examination of the numerators in eq . shows that they do not have painlev equation form @xcite ; this will be confirmed below when we show that the solution has a movable square root branch point .",
    "alternative forms of the master equation can be obtained by various changes of dependent variable .",
    "if we write @xmath122 , then the equation takes the form @xmath123 which expresses the master equation as a system of two first order equations .",
    "if we write @xmath124 , the equation takes the form @xmath125 while writing @xmath126 the equation becomes @xmath127    returning to eq .",

    "where @xmath129 , the equation simplifies to @xmath130 which can be rewritten as @xmath131 in the small @xmath128 regime , where @xmath132 , it simplifies to @xmath133 which can be rewritten as @xmath134    in between the large @xmath128 and small @xmath128 regimes , there is a regime where @xmath135 . to study the behavior here ,",
    "we write @xmath136 , and substitute into eq . , giving @xmath137      we proceed now to examine the large and small @xmath128 behavior . by making the change of dependent variable @xcite @xmath138 , eq .",

    "we next examine the behavior of the solution for finite , nonzero values of @xmath128 . starting from the general form of the master equation given in eq .",
    ", we shall demonstrate several things : ( i ) @xmath157 can not vanish in the interval @xmath158 , ( ii ) @xmath157 can not become infinite in the interval @xmath158 , ( iv ) @xmath157 develops a square root branch point where @xmath135 , and ( iv ) @xmath157 can have minima or maxima in the interval @xmath158 , and must have negative slope at points of inflection .    to study the possible presence of zeros of @xmath157 , we note that in the vicinity of a zero of @xmath157 at @xmath159 we must have @xmath129 , and so we can use the large @xmath128 approximation to the master equation given in eq . . substituting the ansatz @xmath160 ,",
    "with @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 in other words @xmath163 vanishing of the leading term requires @xmath164 , so that either @xmath150 or @xmath165 , both of which are inconsistent with the condition @xmath161 needed for a zero of @xmath157 at @xmath159",
    ". hence @xmath157 can not vanish in the interval @xmath158 .",
    "this conclusion also follows from the exact solution to eq . given in eq .",
    ", which can not develop a zero for finite values of @xmath128 .",
    "we note , however , from eq .",
    ", that if @xmath118 crosses @xmath128 at a point where the slope @xmath189 , then the vanishing numerator factor @xmath190 cancels the vanishing denominator factor @xmath191 , and the solution can be regular .",
    "this behavior is in fact realized in the large @xmath128 portion of the solution , where @xmath118 is decreasing from its peak value .",
    "drawing on the results of the previous subsections , we can give a qualitative sketch of the form of the solution to the master equation .",
    "we assume that the two constants of integration are chosen so that when @xmath208 , the solution approaches the schwarzschild solution @xmath209 with the conventional choice of the first constant of integration @xmath71 , leaving only the second constant of integration @xmath72 as a parameter .",
    "we first give our sketch in terms of @xmath210 and @xmath97 , and then restate it in terms of @xmath211 and the rescaled radius variable @xmath128 . because @xmath82 can have no zeros at finite radius , @xmath82 is always positive , and we assume that are no `` extra wiggles '' resulting in more maxima / minima than required by our above analysis .",
    "in particular , we assume ( as is verified by the numerical solution ) that when @xmath118 crosses @xmath128 at large @xmath128 , the slope is @xmath189 , allowing the soution to be regular .",

    "we give here two algebraic proofs of this interesting result .",
    "the first starts from the expression for @xmath250 in terms of the einstein tensor @xmath251 where we have used the fact that @xmath252 . substituting @xmath253 together with eqs . and",

    "we similarly find that the orthonormal frame curvature tensor components have non - vanishing terms @xmath264 in their expansions near the cusp .",
    "hence these quantities all have coordinate singularities at the cusp , since @xmath265 is infinite at the cusp .        from eq .",
    ", together with the @xmath246 behavior of @xmath118 at infinity , we see that the curvature scalar @xmath260 becomes infinite at @xmath273 , @xmath274 where we have used the asymptotic form of the @xmath275 limiting solution of fig .",
    "this physical singularity is only a _ finite _ proper distance @xmath266 from the origin , as seen by using eq . which gives @xmath276 .",

    "we found that the results were insensitive to changing this value of @xmath239 by a factor of 10 in either direction ( this was not the case when we tried to use the large @xmath97 approximation of eq . to set the initial conditions ) .",

    "thus the modified effective action static , spherically symmetric schwarzschild - like solution has very different properties , near the putative black hole horizon , from the schwarzschild metric .     in isotropic",

    "in the rest of this paper , we will explore whether the bad large distance behavior of the solution of the effective action equations is a reflection of the restriction to a static solution .",
    "the reason for suspecting this is that when the effective action is used with the standard roberston - walker line element @xcite , it gives the usual time dependent cosmological solution . since the effective action is invariant only under time - independent coordinate transformations , one can not proceed by applying a time - dependent coordinate transformation to the static solution . instead , one must study _ ab initio _ time dependent solutions to the effective action equations .      in turning to time - dependent solutions of the effective action equations , a complication arises , in that when time - dependent metrics are allowed , the form of the effective action changes .",

    "we first calculate analytic approximations to the equation system in the small @xmath338 and large @xmath338 regimes . for small @xmath338",

    "hence if there is a continuous solution linking the small-@xmath128 and large @xmath128 regions , in between them there must be a transitional region , where the @xmath388 term strongly decreases in magnitude . since we do not have an analytic approximation to the behavior in this region , in using the @xmath19 perturbation to furnish initial data at a point @xmath239",

    "we have studied in detail the modifications to the schwarzschild black hole solution of general relativity resulting from adding the effective action of eq .",

    "\\(3 ) at cosmological proper distances of order @xmath450 there is another singularity . like the central singularity",
    ", this is a physical singularity , not a coordinate singularity , since curvature invariants become infinite there .",
    "but it may be an artifact of the assumption of a static , time - independent solution , since the form of the solutions is greatly altered when time dependence is allowed .",
    "the absence of a horizon implies that our solution does not obey the `` cosmic censorship '' hypothesis @xcite which states that singularities should be screened by horizons , that is , there are no `` naked singularities '' .",
    "however , whether the central singularity of our solution should be called a `` naked singularity '' is a matter of debate , since this term is usually applied to solutions of the classical einstein equations without quantum or pre - quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , when the solutions of the modified einstein equations studied in this paper become singular or even rapidly varying , use of the effective action of eqs .",
    " , in which derivatives of the metric are neglected , is no longer justified .",
    "hence our analysis leads to no firm predictions about the nature of the central singularity , or indeed , whether there is one in the exact theory .",
    "the most important implication of the absence of a horizon in our modified solution is that the ongoing debate about black holes and quantum information loss @xcite , black hole firewalls @xcite , and whether there is or is not a true horizon in quantum black holes @xcite , will be altered .",
