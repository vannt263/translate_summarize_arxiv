    "polymer thin films are widely used in technology and industry .",

    "films made by blending different polymers provide an economical route to obtain new products with enhanced properties . in general , application of polymer films",
    "requires the surface properties to be homogeneous , but polymer blends tend to phase separate . to improve the dispersion of the polymer blends ,",
    "compatibilizers such as diblock copolymers are commonly used to induce homogeneous mixing between immiscible homopolymers .",
    "however , block copolymers tend to form local aggregates , or micelles , when the copolymer concentration exceeds a critical micelle concentration .",
    "the micelle formation is driven by the unequal miscibility of the two blocks with the homopolymers , such that the miscible blocks form a corona whereas the immiscible blocks form a core , thus minimizing the unfavorable interactions .",
    "the process of micelle formation is similar to the segregation of surfactants in water and the formation of bilayers from amphiphilic lipids .",
    "depending on the chain architecture and interaction parameters , copolymer can from micelles of different shapes .",
    "common morphologies include bilayer sheets , cylinders or spheres @xcite .    in some processes",
    ", micelle formation is an undesirable effect which should be avoided , but there are also applications where polymer micelles can beneficial .",
    "one example is to use micelles for drug delivery by encapsulating the medicine substance inside the micelle core @xcite .",
    "compared to micelles made by surfactants of low - molecular weight , polymeric micelles are significantly more stable , have a larger capacity , and can be biocompatible by modifying the chemical details . under biological conditions , micelles need to pass through various confined environments , such as the capillary vessels .",
    "therefore , it is crucially important to understand how confinement affects the micelle properties .",
    "polymer thin films can be viewed as polymers under planar or one - dimensional confinement . for copolymer melts ,",
    "planar confinement can introduce frustration in the bulk structure and induce novel morphologies which are not available in bulk system @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior is determined by the relation between the size of confinement and the natural spacing of the structure .",
    "when the two length scales are compatible , bulk structures are preserved ; otherwise , new morphologies such as perforated lamellae can be formed .",
    "similarly , the confinement can also influence the micelle formation in diblock copolymer / homopolymer blends , and the important factor is the ratio between the micelle size and the dimension of confinement .",
    "when the confinement is weak , the micelle reacts by slightly shrinking its size in the direction of the confinement .",
    "as the dimension of the confinement becomes compatible to the micelle size , the micelle formation becomes unfavorable , resulting in an increase of the critical micelle concentration @xcite .",
    "various computational methods have been used to study diblock copolymers under planar confinement , such as the scaling argument @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite , density function theory @xcite and self - consistent field theory @xcite .",

    "these studies have greatly enriched our understanding of the micelle formation in the thin film geometry . however , a detailed investigation of the shape variation by changing various parameters , especially the surface separation , has been lacking .",
    "furthermore the effect of the asymmetric surfaces is remained to be explored .    in order to better understand the micelle formation and shape variation in thin film geometry",
    ", we employ a real - space self - consistent field theory to study the micelle shape in a confined blend of diblock copolymers and homopolymers ( ab / a ) .",
    "micelles have different morphologies in a bulk system : bilayers , cylinders , and spheres @xcite .",
    "only the bilayer structure is commensurate with the thin film geometry , whereas the spherical and cylindrical micelles must undergo deformation when perturbed by the surface . for simplicity",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the shape variation of an isolated micelle formed in thin films of ab - diblock copolymer and a - homopolymer blends .",
    "scft has been employed to compute the free energy and density profiles of the micelle .",
    "the shape of the micelle becomes anisotropic under planar confinement .",
    "deviation from the bulk geometry appears when the film thickness is comparable to the size of the micelle .",
    "morphology transition can also happen when the confinement is strong .",
    "two sequences of shape change are identified by comparing the free energy of micelles with different morphology .",
    "one is the transition from a spherical micelle to a cylindrical micelle perpendicular to the surface , and the other one is from a parallel cylindrical micelle to a lamellar micelle .",
    "for spherical micelles , the free energy increases as the confinement become strong ; thus it becomes energetically unfavorable for the micelle formation .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite that the critical micelle concentration increases as confinement increases .",
    "several parameters control the micelle shape in thin polymer films . in the bulk system",
    ", the micellization depends primarily on the copolymer architecture and monomer - monomer interactions . in the thin film ,",
    "the confinement introduces the effect of structure frustration and surface interaction .",
    "the degree of structure frustration depends on the relationship between the micelle size and film thickness .",
    "if the two are incomparable , the aggregate must deviate from its equilibrium shape to relieve the imposed frustration . this in general leads to reduced size of the micelle and an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis parallel to the surfaces . beside the geometry confinement , the other important factor is the surface selectivity .",
    "the interaction between monomers and hard surfaces can be neutral or preferential .",
    "the selectivity also causes deviation from the structures observed in the bulk . to characterize the shape variation quantitatively ,",
    "we calculate the radius of gyration tensor for the micelle .",
    "an increase of the asphericity and acylindricity when the surface separation is reduced and when the surface interaction becomes stronger . for the case",
    "when the two surfaces have different selectivities , an expansion method is used to study the micelle shape , and the first - order coefficient is an indicator of the deviation from top - down symmetry .",
    "our scft calculations demonstrate that valuable information can be obtained , such as the geometrical dimensions of the micelle , and the monomer density profiles .",
    "these properties are closely related to several parameters : the architecture of the copolymer , the monomer - monomer interactions , the film thickness , and surface interactions . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the effect of the film thickness and surface interactions , and use diblock copolymer as an example . our model can be easily extended to different polymer architectures , and the shape variation by varying the surface separation and selectivities would exhibit similar trends for different monomer - monomer interactions . by varying these parameters",
    ", we can control the micelle shape and size in the thin film .",
    "since it is expensive and time - consuming for experimentalists to explore the parameter space by trial - and - error , theoretical study can be of great help to understand the underlying physics and provide guidance for experiments .",
    "the present approach has a number of limitations .",
    "for the cylindrical micelle parallel to the surface and the lamellar micelle , one has to be cautious because they are ideal cases without the ends and edges . in real experiments ,",
    "they can be twisted and forms labyrinth structures .",
    "our method also neglects the translational entropy of the micelle ; therefore the calculated points of morphology transition are only qualitatively correct .",
    "furthermore , the surface attraction to one block of the copolymer may induce the formation of surface micelles , an important phenomenon we have not touched in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , by computing the free energies and shape parameters for different micelle morphologies , we have obtained the trends of micelle formation in the thin polymer films .",
    "the results provide a detailed picture of the variation and transition of micelle shape and illustrate the effect of confinement and surface interactions .",
    "we thank arif gozen , kristen roskov , jan genzer , and richard spontak from ncsu for their experiments on polymer film @xcite which inspired this work .",
