    "coherent radiation by large collections of small particles has been studied extensively with applications in antennas , atmospheric scattering or plasma diagnostics .",
    "the behavior of those macroscopic scattering devices is ruled by the interference of the fields scattered by many microscopic elements . in atomic physics ,",
    "matter - light interactions have been studied extensively in the past decades , ranging from spectroscopy to laser manipulation of the atomic internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "intriguing properties can be obtained when many atoms are interacting with photons , as studied in the seminal work by dicke @xcite and more recently by cold samples of bosonic atoms in a trap @xcite .",
    "other complex quantum features are obtained when the quantum properties of light and/or of atoms are taken into account , as is done e.g. in studies of quantum cryptography and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "often a quantum description of two level atoms and a quantum description of the light field in terms of photon operator is very convenient to describe the atom - light interactions .",
    "however one should not forget that many features can well be described with classical models for the atoms with a polarizability and for the light field .",
    "many features of dicke superradiance can thus be explained using classical antenna theory . as atoms appear to be excellent systems to study any possible deviation from classical many body features , it is a general interest to understand and to control cooperative effects , even at a classical level , in a cloud of atoms .",
    "new intriguing effects can arise , when fluctuations due to the coupling with the vacuum modes can no longer be described by a classical field approach and the atoms can also become entangled during the cooperative scattering .",
    "such cooperative scattering with atomic ensembles can appear in a number of experimental situations in free space @xcite or in cavities @xcite .",
    "the problem of collective spontaneous emission has recently received growing interest with the study of single photon superradiance from @xmath0 two - level atoms prepared by the absorption of one photon of wave vector @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the photon is spontaneously emitted in the same direction of the incident photon with a cooperative decay rate proportional to @xmath0 and inversely proportional to the size of the atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "these studies considered the decay of atoms prepared in the ` timed dicke state ' : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a fock state in which the atom @xmath4 is prepared in the excited state @xmath5 and all the other atoms being in the ground state @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the position of the atom @xmath4 . in these papers , only resonant photons have been considered and their reabsorption by other atoms has been neglected .",
    "as a situation closer to an experimental realization , we consider a cold atomic cloud with a gaussian density distribution irradiated by a plane wave laser beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if the laser beam is detuned far enough from the atomic resonance to avoid multi - atom absorption , a timed dicke state is generated .",
    "the large detuning also ensures that the dominant fraction of photons is elastically scattered .    in this paper ,",
    "going beyond the mere consideration of the light emission by an atomic ensemble , we will revisit the phenomenon of radiation pressure in a regime where scattering is dominated by cooperative effects .",
    "mechanical effects combined to cooperative emission have been studied for atomic ensembles in cavities @xcite or in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "however , they also occur in free space @xcite and , as we will show in this paper , can modify not only the emission properties but also the absorption process . indeed , the absorption properties are affected by superradiant enhancement of the spontaneous decay rate . on the other hand , cooperative scattering bundles the scattered light into forward direction , which leads to a suppression of radiation pressure .",
    "this suppression is only limited by the inhomogeneity of the atomic cloud , which occupies a finite volume . for volumes larger than the dicke limit",
    ", @xmath8 , the net effect of cooperativity is a suppression of radiation pressure far below the value expected for independent scattering .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation for an ensemble of @xmath0 two - level atoms with the resonance frequency @xmath9 driven by a far - detuned laser field with the frequency @xmath10 and the wave vector @xmath11 . for a laser field",
    "sufficiently detuned from resonance so that the average number of excited atoms in the cloud is less than unity , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the rabi frequency of the laser field ) , we assume that only one among @xmath0 atoms is excited by absorption of a single laser photon , which is then spontaneously emitted into vacuum modes with frequencies @xmath14 and wave vectors @xmath15 . within the markov approximation ( valid for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimension of the cloud @xcite ) we obtain expressions for the time - evolution of the state amplitudes allowing us to derive a generalized expression for the steady - state radiation pressure in the presence of cooperative effects .",
    "in the limit where the atomic cloud can be described by a smooth spherical gaussian density distribution , an analytical calculation of the structure factors allows us to derive an explicit expression for the radiation pressure as a function of volume , shape , atom numbers , and pump laser detuning . in particular , we identify two regimes distinct by different scalings of the radiation pressure with atom numbers .",

    "we treat the atoms as simple two - level systems .",
    "we also assume that all atoms are driven by the unperturbed incident laser beam , thus neglecting dephasing by atoms along the laser path or by near field effects , which could arise for large spatial densities .",
    "calling @xmath25 the atomic ground state and @xmath26 the state where only the atom @xmath4 is excited , we assume that the total state of the system has the following form : @xmath27 the above expression assumes that only states with at most one atomic excitation contribute to the effects described in this paper",

    "for a smooth - density spherical cloud the ratio between the cooperative radiation pressure force ( [ eqcooperativeforce ] ) and the single - atom force becomes @xmath84 the emission pattern is described by the @xmath85 term .",
    "an isotropic emission pattern , obtained e.g.  for small volumes , leads to vanishing @xmath85 . in contrast , for large volumes the recoil at emission compensates the recoil at absorption , @xmath86 , which results in mainly forward emission .",

    "it is interesting to compare this with the dicke limit of small clouds , @xmath96 , where the structure factor becomes @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , the surface - integrated values are @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that the force ratio for small and large atom numbers becomes , respectively , @xmath101    note that the phase shift of the laser beam after passing through the atomic cloud can affect the driving term of eq .",
    "( [ eqhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "indeed , for a spherical atomic cloud with resonant optical density @xmath102 , the characteristic atom number @xmath103 can be expressed in terms of the phase shift experienced by the pump laser beam on its path across the cloud : @xmath104 . in other words , for atom numbers so large , that despite its large detuning the pump laser beam is shifted by more than @xmath105 , the radiation pressure force is dramatically suppressed . for low spatial densities of the atomic cloud ,",
    "this phase shift remains small compared to the free propagation phase shift @xmath106 and only weakly modifies the scattering properties of the atomic cloud .",
    "as we assume that each atom is only driven by the external field , we also neglect multiple scattering of a photon in the atomic cloud .",
    "the above calculations are thus not valid for @xmath107 .",
    "the collective radiation pressure described in this paper is likely to be of importance for samples with large on - resonance optical thickness ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "samples with such an optical thickness are e.g. used to study multiple scattering of light in cold atoms @xcite ( with @xmath109 ) and most bose - einstein condensates also fulfill this criterium . for an experimental observation of the collective radiation pressure , a low intensity quasi - resonant laser",
    "would be required to measure radiation pressure , e.g. in a time of flight experiment after the exchange of several photons per atom on average .",
    "such experiments are state of the art as well for cold atom in magneto - optical traps as for atoms from a bose - einstein condensate . for",
    "bose - einstein condensates the modification of the scattering properties of light might also allow to address the problem of spurious heating in optical dipole traps where spontaneous scattering might appear in some limits .",
    "we note again that cooperativity in the radiation pressure as described in this paper does not rely on self - organization or correlations between different scattering events ( as in @xcite ) but it is intrinsic in the scattering of a single photon by a correlated system of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "although the calculated expression of the average radiation pressure does not exhibit specific quantum features and could be in principle obtainable classically , the study of higher moments of the atomic distribution and fluctuations should shed light on the quantum properties of the entangled state @xcite .",
    "this topic will be at the aim of our forthcoming studies .",
    "we have shown by an explicit calculation that the radiation pressure depends on the atom number via cooperative scattering .",
    "the assumption of a smooth density distribution allowed us to integrate the structure factors .",
    "we have shown that the radiation pressure is strongly affected by both a cooperative modification of the absorption and the emission properties of the atomic cloud .",
    "we have identified different regimes , where enhanced absorption can increase the radiation pressure for intermediate atom numbers or where forward emission almost cancels the recoil imparted to the atoms at the absorption .",
    "these calculations indicate that experiments are in reach with state of the art clouds of cold atoms .",
    "as the driven timed dicke states involved in our model are entangled atomic states , radiation pressure might become an interesting tool to investigate non classical features of cooperative scattering of light by clouds of cold atoms .                                for a debate concerning the validity of the rwa in a regime , where collective lamb - shifts may play a role , see r. friedberg and j.  t. manassah , phys .",
