    "nonequilibrium systems with absorbing ( trapped ) states have been extensively studied in recent years , because of their wide applicability to various phenomena in natural science as well as in social and economical science @xcite . the absorbing transition between an active phase into an absorbing phase",
    "can be regarded as one of the simplest and natural extensions of the well - established equilibrium phase transition to nonequilibrium systems .",
    "critical behaviors near an absorbing transition are categorized into a few universality classes characterized by the symmetry between absorbing states and/or the conservation in dynamics @xcite .",
    "the most prominent universality class is the directed percolation ( dp ) class @xcite , which involves typically a single absorbing state without any conservation in dynamics .",
    "most of absorbing - type nonequilibrium models belong to the dp class .",
    "only a small number of models form different classes such as the directed ising ( di ) class involving two equivalent classes of absorbing states @xcite and the parity - conserving ( pc ) class with mod ( 2 ) conservation of the total particle number @xcite .",
    "these two classes coincide in one dimension by identifying a domain wall in the di - type models as a particle in the pc - type models . in higher dimensions , both types of models are always active ( no absorbing phase ) except at a trivial point (",
    "annihilation fixed point ) and their critical behavior is described by the mean field theory .",
    "none of the models studied so far with higher symmetries than the ising symmetry ( for example , potts symmetry ) stabilizes an absorbing phase even in one dimension .    recently",
    ", a variety of coupled systems have been investigated extensively .",
    "janssen @xcite studied coupled dp processes with bilinear and bidirectional interspecies couplings in the framework of bosonic field theory , where no other critical phenomena were found than the dp .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied linearly and unidirectionally coupled dp processes , where a series of new multicritical phenomena was observed .",
    "coupled pc ( di ) processes have been also studied @xcite , where the absorbing phase become unstable with respect to an arbitrarily small branching rate even in one dimension .",
    "more interestingly , the critical behavior near the annihilation fixed point depends on details of particle dynamics such as the presence of interspecies hard core ( hc ) interaction and the branching method @xcite .",
    "stochastic models for linearly and bidirectionally coupled dp processes have been also studied through two - species branching annihilating random walks with one offspring ( baw@xmath7 ) in one dimension @xcite .",
    "it was found that the hc interaction is crucial in a strong coupling regime , where the absorbing phase ( vacuum ) becomes unstable and the system is always active except at the annihilation fixed point of zero branching rate .",
    "critical behavior near the annihilation fixed point was conjectured via an analytic argument and confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the @xmath0-species baw@xmath7 models and also the @xmath0-species contact processes ( cp ) with and without interspecies hc interaction .",
    "the single - species baw@xmath7 and cp both belong to the dp universality class , but their upper critical dimensions are different ( @xmath8 and 4 ) @xcite . the essential difference is the absence of spontaneous annihilation process @xmath9 in the baw@xmath7 , where particle annihilations occur only in pairs through binary diffusion processes @xmath10 .",
    "this annihilation random walk nature of the baw@xmath7 makes the vacuum unstable for @xmath11 . in the coupled systems",
    ", one can expect a similar scenario that the stability of the vacuum also depends crucially on the presence of the spontaneous annihilation process . furthermore , as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the vacuum becomes more unstable in the @xmath0-baw@xmath7 , because the annihilation process of only the same species of particles is allowed .",
    "a sufficiently strong interspecies coupling may wash away completely the absorbing phase for large enough @xmath0 even in one dimension , even without any hc interaction . in this paper , we address this vacuum stability question in the strong coupling regime and measure the threshold value of @xmath0 with and without hc interaction .",
    "outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the @xmath0-species cp models are introduced .",

    "iii , we study the @xmath0-species baw@xmath7 models by numerical simulations .",
    "we find that , for @xmath3 , the vacuum becomes unstable with respect to an arbitrarily small branching rate in a sufficiently strong coupling regime .",
    "the critical behavior near the zero branching point is explored in terms of the scaling exponents . in a weak coupling regime ,",
    "the conventional dp transition into a stable vacuum is observed .",
    "the interspecies hc interaction only shifts the dp critical points and the threshold value of the interspecies coupling for complete disappearance of a stable vacuum .",
    "the @xmath4 case is special . without hc interaction ,",
    "one can always find the dp transition into a stable vacuum even at the full coupling strength , like in the @xmath0-species cp models .",
    "however , the inclusion of hc interaction makes the vacuum unstable again in a strong coupling regime .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the directional asymmetry in the bidirectional couplings on the phase diagram .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "the @xmath0-species coupled contact process ( @xmath0-cp ) is defined by the following evolution rules : ( 1 ) each particle annihilates spontaneously with probability @xmath12 or ( 2 ) creates a particle of the same species with probability @xmath13 or a particle of the different species with probability @xmath14 in its neighborhood ( branching process ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "any branching attempt is rejected if it would result in a multiple occupation by the same species particles at a site . with",

    "each species is symmetrically coupled with other species by the interspecies coupling strength @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "all species are completely decoupled .",
    "it is trivial to show that the @xmath0-cp models with hc interaction become identical to the single - species cp model .",
    "each site can be occupied by only one particle , regardless of its species .",
    "any configuration and any dynamic process in the n - cp can be exactly mapped on its corresponding configuration and dynamic process of the single - species cp by simply ignoring the particle species .    without hc interaction , a multiple occupation by different species particles",
    "is allowed .",
    "one can easily expect that the active phase expands until the multiple occupation is maximized . for @xmath4 , there exists a simple duality between two species @xmath21 and the maximum point is located at @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( a ) . for @xmath23 , the maximum point",

    "the @xmath0-species coupled branching annihilating random walks with one offspring ( @xmath0-baw@xmath7 ) , is defined by the following evolution rules : ( 1 ) each particle hops to a nearest - neighboring site with probability @xmath12 or ( 2 ) creates a particle of the same species with probability @xmath13 or a particle of the different species with probability @xmath14 in its neighborhood ( branching process ) as    @xmath28    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . if two identical particles happen to be on the same site , both particles immediately annihilate each other ( @xmath29 ) . with interspecies",
    "hc interaction , any hopping or branching attempt is rejected if it would result in a multiple occupation of particles , regardless of their species .",
    "the above model has a permutational symmetry between species .",
    "later , we will also study an asymmetrically coupled system which breaks the permutational symmetry .",
    "the two - species baw@xmath7 model has been investigated previously for general @xmath25 @xcite . in this paper , we present the numerically improved phase diagram in fig .  [ fig-2 ] ( a ) and briefly summarize the results of @xcite for comparison to those for @xmath3 and also for self - containedness . without hc interaction , the system always exhibits the dp - type absorbing transition for all @xmath25 , including the case of the maximum coupling strength ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , with hc interaction , there exists a strong coupling regime ( @xmath32 ) where the vacuum becomes unstable with respect to an arbitrarily small branching rate ( @xmath33 ) and completely disappears in the phase diagram except at the annihilation fixed point ( @xmath34 ) . the threshold value for the strong coupling regime is numerically estimated as @xmath35 . in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath36 )",
    ", we observe the conventional dp transition into the vacuum .",

    "lines between data points are guides to the eyes only . ]",
    "it is not surprising to see that the active phase expands as @xmath19 increases , because a collision chance of the same species particles decreases .",
    "however , the effect of hc interaction is rather tricky . for small @xmath19 , the system tends to form large domains of the same species particles .",
    "the hc interaction induces an effective diffusion bias directed to the domain center , which accelerates the pair annihilation process .",
    "therefore the system becomes less active with hc interaction . for large @xmath19 , the situation is reversed .",
    "the system prefers locally heterogeneous configurations and the hc interaction reduces a chance of binary collision of the same species particles .",
    "thus , in this case , the system becomes more active with hc interaction .",
    "this explains why two critical lines with and without hc interaction should cross each other as in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .    consider the @xmath37 line , where a particle can not create a particle of the same species . as a result",
    ", a single particle can not be annihilated by a single branching and diffusion process : @xmath38 .",
    "it needs at least three branching processes such as @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "this four particle state can turn into vacuum via successive pair annihilations only if diffusion across a different species particle is allowed ( no hc interaction ) .",
    "hence , the vacuum can be stable in a low branching ( high diffusion ) regime .",
    "however , in the presence of hc interaction , the ordered @xmath41 pairs can not be annihilated by diffusions .",
    "therefore , a single particle has a nonzero probability to survive asymptotically and the vacuum is unstable with respect to an arbitrarily small branching rate .",
    "the critical behavior near the annihilation fixed point in the strong coupling regime is characterized by a set of the scaling exponents @xmath42 where the exponents @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 characterize the scaling behavior of the steady - state particle density @xmath46 , the correlation length @xmath47 , and the relaxation time @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the exponent ratios , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , originate from the ordinary diffusion nature at the annihilation fixed point in one dimension @xcite .",
    "there is only one independent exponent @xmath43 , of which the value can be extracted by a simple argument @xcite .",
    "consider a particle @xmath51 created by a particle @xmath52 .",
    "this branching process increases the particle density with the time scale @xmath53 . near the annihilation fixed point of zero branching rate ,",
    "the offspring @xmath51 would be annihilated by colliding with an independent @xmath51 via diffusion .",
    "the time scale for this process is governed by ordinary diffusion : @xmath54 where the mean distance between particles @xmath55 is order of the inverse of the particle density @xmath56 . balancing these two time scales , we can expect the steady - state particle density to scale as @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "this argument is quite general , so it should apply to many other models exhibiting a critical behavior near the annihilation fixed point .",
    "moreover , the hc interaction does not matter in this argument .",
    "so , one can expect that the @xmath0-species baw@xmath7 should belong to the same class ( @xmath58 ) for any @xmath59 , regardless of the presence of hc interaction , which will be confirmed numerially in next subsection .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-species baw@xmath60 also belongs to the same class when the hc interaction is present and the branching method is _ static _ : two offspring are divided by their parent , @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear that our argument applies to this model , due to the hc interaction .",
    "when the branching method is _ dynamic _ or there is no hc interaction , @xmath0-baw@xmath60 belongs to different universality classes @xcite .",

    "this result is rather unexpected because , for @xmath4 , the vacuum is always stable for a low branching rate without hc interaction . before going into detailed discussion on this vacuum instability without hc interaction , we present numerical results .",
    "the threshold value of the vacuum instability is estimated as @xmath77 @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , we observe that the system undergoes an absorbing transition into vacuum .",

    "as explained before , there needs a sequence of branching processes for a single particle annihilation . for @xmath4 without hc interaction ,",
    "the process of @xmath99 is possible . in this case ,",
    "@xmath100 or @xmath101 pairs will quickly go away at a very high diffusion rate , so one may consider only @xmath41 pairs , which can not be annihilated by itself .",
    "the last two reaction events can be regarded as a collision and annihilation event of two @xmath41 pairs and the previous reaction events as a creation event of a @xmath41 pair out of a parent @xmath41 pair .",
    "this process is exactly equivalent to the @xmath102 baw@xmath7 model by identifying a @xmath41 pair as a particle .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 case without hc interaction can have a stable vacuum like in the @xmath102 model .",

    "three different pairs ( @xmath41 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) are possible .",
