    "ricci flow is now a standard tool in geometry and topology , and one of its main uses is to provide a means of deforming a given riemannian metric , hopefully into one that is `` distinguished '' in some sense . on a fixed riemannian manifold",
    ", ricci flow may be viewed as a dynamical system on the space of riemannian metrics , modulo diffeomorphisms . in this context , distinguished metrics are einstein or ricci soliton metrics , and we phrase the problem of `` deforming into a distinguished metric '' in terms of dynamical stability .",
    "namely , given a stationary solution @xmath0 of ricci flow and some topology on the space of metrics , does there exist a neighborhood @xmath1 of @xmath0 such that all ricci flow solutions with initial data in @xmath1 converge to @xmath0 ?",
    "many authors have considered stability for solutions of ricci flow ; see the introduction of @xcite for a description of some of the results and techniques used .",
    "the approach to stability that we take in this paper follows the program initiated by guenther , isenberg , and knopf in @xcite , which , roughly speaking , has three steps :    1 .   modify ricci flow ( e.g. , by diffeomorphisms and rescaling ) so that it has a suitable class of fixed points . 2 .",
    "compute the linearization at a fixed point and prove linear stability .",
    "3 .   set up a sequence of tensor spaces with certain interpolation properties and apply a theorem of simonett to get dynamical stability .",
    "since its introduction in @xcite , this program has been used to prove a variety of other stability results @xcite .    for step 1 ,",
    "the flow that we wish to study appeared in @xcite .",
    "given a manifold @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and a vector field @xmath4 , the _ curvature - normalized ricci flow _",
    "is @xmath5 a ricci soliton @xmath6 , which satisfies @xmath7 is clearly a stationary solution of .",
    "( recall that an einstein metric corresponds to a ricci soliton where the field @xmath4 is a killing field . )    for step 2 , the linearization of the flow was also considered in @xcite .",
    "after modification by deturck diffeomorphisms , the linearization is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lichnerowicz laplacian acting on symmetric 2-tensors .",
    "a stationary solution of is _ strictly _ ( resp .",
    "_ weakly _ ) _ linearly stable _ if the operator @xmath10 has negative ( resp",
    ".  non - positive ) spectrum , that is , if there exists some @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) such that @xmath13 for all symmetric 2-tensors @xmath14 taken from some appropriate tensor space .",
    "we emphasize that the notion of linear stability for a given metric depends on a particular linear operator .",
    "for example , koiso studied stability of einstein metrics with respect to the second variation of the total scalar curvature functional @xcite .",
    "other authors have studied stability of shrinking ( @xmath15 ) , gradient ( @xmath16 for some @xmath17 ) ricci solitons with respect to the second variation of perelman s @xmath18-functional ; see , for example @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will not be directly concerned with step 3 and the aspects of dynamical stability .",
    "indeed , our goal is to study the _ linear stability _ of homogeneous einstein and ricci soliton metrics on non - compact manifolds , with respect to the operator from .",
    "( step 3 is , however , the primary focus of a companion paper by wu and the third author @xcite , see theorem [ thm : dynamical - all ] below . )",
    "the first results for such metrics are found in @xcite , where the authors give a detailed analysis of homogeneous solitons on three spaces :  @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .    since that work ,",
    "much has been discovered about homogeneous solitons .",
    "it turns out that the only non - trivial homogeneous ricci solitons occur in the non - compact , expanding ( @xmath22 ) , and non - gradient ( @xmath23 for any @xmath17 ) case ; see section 2 of @xcite for a discussion of this fact .",
    "additionally , all known examples can be realized as left - invariant metrics on simply connected solvable lie groups ( or , equivalently , as inner products on solvable lie algebras ",
    "well use both interpretations ) , such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ricci endomorphism , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a derivation of the lie algebra .",
    "a metric satisfying this equation is called an _ algebraic soliton _ ; on nilpotent and solvable lie groups , such metrics are called _ nilsolitons _ and _ solvsolitons _ , respectively .",
    "an algebraic soliton is in fact a ricci soliton ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; conversely , a ricci soliton on a solvable lie group is isometric to a solvsoliton ( on a possibly different lie group ) . also , a solvable lie group admitting a non - flat algebraic soliton is diffeomorphic to @xmath28 .",
    "these last two facts appear in @xcite .",
    "lauret has also proven strong structural results for algebraic solitons @xcite .",
    "essentially , nilsolitons are the nilpotent parts of solvsolitons  a solvsoliton implies the existence of a nilsoliton on the nilradical , and conversely , any nilsoliton can be extended in a specific way to a solvsoliton .",
    "see theorem [ thm : lauret ] for more details .",
    "this new knowledge allows us to expand upon the linear stability work done in @xcite .",
    "here is an outline of the paper and a description of the results . in section [ sec : lin - criteria",
    "] , we analyze the linearized ricci flow operator from and derive a sufficient condition for linear stability of soliton metrics ( including einstein metrics ) under the flow .",
    "this condition covers a somewhat general class of metrics , but our main focus is the algebraic soliton case , where @xmath29 .    [",
    "prop : stab - conds ] let @xmath6 be a ricci soliton with constant scalar curvature .",
    "the following condition implies that @xmath30 is strictly linearly stable : @xmath31 for all symmetric 2-tensors @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath30 is @xmath32-einstein , this condition is @xmath33    here , @xmath34 is the action of the riemann curvature tensor on symmetric 2-tensors .",
    "we also have criteria based on sectional curvature bounds .",
    "[ prop : sec - stab ] let @xmath6 be a ricci soliton with constant scalar curvature , and suppose that the sectional curvature satisfies @xmath35 for some constant @xmath36 .",
    "a sufficient condition for @xmath30 to be strictly linearly stable is that @xmath37    we emphasize that these results only give _ sufficient _ conditions for linear stability , as they do not involve the full operator from .",
    "the hope is that , in the case of solvable lie groups , one can use algebraic methods to verify these conditions relatively simply .",
    "it turns out that this hope is too optimistic , as there are examples of metrics  both einstein and non - einstein  for which these propositions fail to give stability ; see subsection [ subsec : abelian - einstein ] .",
    "however , as we will see in theorem [ thm : stab - all ] , these propositions succeed in many other cases .    in section [ sec : extensions ] , we explore the relationship between linear stability of a solvable einstein metric and its associated nilsoliton in the case of codimension - one nilradical . using proposition [ prop : stab - conds ] , we show that stability of the einstein metric implies stability of the nilsoliton when the eigenvalues of the nilsoliton derivation are not too large , relative to the trace of the derivation .",

    "also in that section we use the continuity of the curvature operators to show that any non - nilpotent solvsoliton satisfying is contained in an open set of stable solvsolitons .",
    "this set is open in the moduli space of solvsoliton extensions of the nilradical of the original stable metric .    in section",
    "[ sec : abelian ] , we consider abelian nilsolitons ( which are trivially stable ) and their solvsoliton extensions .",
    "we calculate the sectional curvatures and use proposition [ prop : sec - stab ] to find an open set ( in an appropriate moduli space ) of stable solvsolitons whose nilradicals have codimension one ; see proposition [ prop : abelian - sec ] .    in section [ sec:2step ] ,",
    "we use proposition [ prop : stab - conds ] to derive conditions for stability of two - step nilsolitons . using structural results due to eberlein @xcite , and analyzing the possible ricci tensors of nilsoliton metrics , we prove that all two - step nilsolitons are stable ; see proposition [ prop:2step - stab ] .",
    "the space of all such solitons is quite large ; in particular , there are continuous families @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec:3step ] , we consider linear stability of solvable einstein metrics whose nilradicals are two - step and codimension - one . while the techniques of section [ sec:2step ] do not work in all cases here , we are able to obtain stability for two countably infinite families of metrics .",
    "first are those where the nilradical is a generalized heisenberg group , and second are where the nilradical is a free two - step nilpotent lie group ; see proposition [ prop : stab - solv - heis - free ] .",
    "we also briefly discuss spaces of negative curvature and proposition [ prop : sec - stab ] .",
    "in particular , we use results of heber @xcite to find high - dimensional families of stable einstein metrics that arise as deformations of certain quaternionic and cayley hyperbolic spaces .    in section [ sec : low - dim ] , we consider `` low - dimensional '' examples .",
    "namely , we prove linear stability of all nilsolitons in dimension six or less , using the classification found in @xcite .",
    "we also prove linear stability for the corresponding one - dimensional solvable einstein extensions , except in the case of the hyperbolic space @xmath43 , which is only weakly linearly stable .",
    "this gives almost 100 examples of stable metrics on solvable lie groups .",
    "see proposition [ prop : low - dim ] and tables [ table : solitons ] and [ table : solitons2 ] .",
    "we show that each metric in a curve of seven - dimensional nilsolitons is strictly linearly stable , and also their one - dimensional einstein extensions .",
    "finally , we show that each solvsoliton extension of the three - dimensional heisenberg algebra is strictly linearly stable .",
    "here is a summary of the spaces shown to be stable .",
    "[ thm : stab - all ] the following algebraic solitons are strictly linearly stable with respect to the curvature - normalized ricci flow :    1 .",
    "[ item1 ] every nilsoliton of dimension six or less , and every member of a certain one - parameter family of seven - dimensional nilsolitons ; 2 .",

    "further , any non - nilpotent solvsoliton @xmath49 satisfying and @xmath50 is contained in an open set of stable solvsolitons .",
    "this list is , of course , not complete .",
    "one might be tempted to conjecture that all solvsolitons are strictly linearly stable , but this is not clear .",
    "as mentioned above , in subsection [ subsec : abelian - einstein ] we give examples of metrics for which both propositions [ prop : stab - conds ] and [ prop : sec - stab ] fail to give stability .",
    "these metrics are possibly stable , but our methods are insufficient to prove it .",
    "as the focus of this paper is linear stability , we will not directly consider the dynamical aspects of stability .",
    "however , using the results of @xcite , we have dynamical stability for each metric in theorem [ thm : stab - all ] .",
    "[ thm : dynamical - all ] each metric from theorem [ thm : stab - all ] is dynamically stable in the context of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) for einstein metrics and of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.2 ) for non - einstein solitons .",
    "this theorem adds to the understanding of long - time behavior of ricci flow solutions .",
    "indeed , expanding homogeneous solitons are expected to act as singularity models for ( at least some ) type - iii ricci flow singularities , and this is known to be true in some cases @xcite . theorem [ thm : dynamical - all ] exhibits many more examples of ricci flow solutions that converge to expanding homogeneous solitons .",
    "in this section we find conditions that imply linear stability , and doing so requires us to understand the linear operator @xmath10 from . in particular , we analyze the various components that make up the @xmath51 inner product @xmath52 , which include various curvature operators , laplace operators , and lie derivatives .",
    "the main results of this section , propositions [ prop : stab - conds ] and [ prop : sec - stab ] , give sufficient conditions for linear stability in the case of constant scalar curvature .",
