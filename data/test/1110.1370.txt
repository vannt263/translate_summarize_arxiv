    "electron scattering off magnetic impurities , unlike the potential scattering , substantially modifies the properties of _ s_-wave superconductors .",
    "it was realized in the seminal work by abrikosov and gorkov@xcite ( ag ) that the presence of magnetic impurities reduces the superconducting gap below its bcs value and eventually may lead to the phenomenon of gapless superconductivity .",
    "the gap suppression was investigated by means of tunneling between normal and superconducting electrodes.@xcite beyond the ag theory , it was realized that a single magnetic impurity creates a localized state within the bcs gap.@xcite a small concentration of magnetic impurities results in the formation of an impurity band@xcite which merges with the continuum as the concentration exceeds a certain value ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "( the original ag theory is valid above that value . )",
    "the impurity band was investigated by tunneling experiments with alloys ( such as pbmn)@xcite and normal metal ",
    "superconductor bilayers,@xcite and also by means of thermal transport in superconducting films.@xcite the observation of discrete levels associated with a separate magnetic impurity came later in the scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.@xcite    the effect of magnetic impurities came under scrutiny recently in connection with limits on performance of superconducting elements in qubits@xcite and photon detectors.@xcite in these applications , superconductors should perform in the ac regime .",
    "there is also some experimental effort directly aimed at observation of the effect of magnetic impurities on the surface impedance of superconducting multilayers@xcite and unconventional superconductors.@xcite theoretically , the results on impedance@xcite were analyzed in the framework of a simple two - fluid model .",
    "the two - fluid model assumes a simplified frequency - independent drude - type dissipative conductivity @xmath0 , while the influence of magnetic impurities on the electron spectrum should lead to a nontrivial @xmath1 dependence on the frequency @xmath2 .",
    "a theoretical approach to studying the surface impedance in superconductors was developed in the celebrated work of mattis and bardeen,@xcite which treated the anomalous skin effect ( the skin depth is smaller than the mean free path ) taking nonmagnetic disorder into account .",
    "independently , the clean case was considered by abrikosov , gorkov , and khalatnikov@xcite in the green - function language .",
    "later , nam@xcite employed the same technique and demonstrated that the extreme anomalous limit is equivalent ( up to the expressions for the normal - metallic conductivities ) to the local limit , realized in the dirty regime .",
    "the complex conductivity of a superconductor containing both potential and magnetic impurities was addressed by skalski _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite their paper does contain general results applicable in the case of weak magnetic scattering ; however , similarly to the ag theory , scattering off magnetic impurities was considered in the born approximation , which did not allow to treat the effect of localized states on the impedance . in ref .",
    ", larkin and ovchinnikov considered superconductors with inhomogeneous pairing , which under certain assumptions is formally equivalent to the presence of magnetic impurities in the ag regime . some of their results can therefore be applied to this problem .",
    "however , a convenient formulation of the theory , suitable for the experimentally relevant dirty limit and making it possible to treat both the ag regime and the impurity band , as well as detailed quantitative investigation of the effect of magnetic impurities on the surface impedance in different regimes over temperature , frequency , and electron scattering rate off magnetic impurities is still lacking , to the best of our knowledge .    in this paper , we study the influence of magnetic impurities on the complex conductivity and surface impedance of a superconductor .",
    "we are especially interested in the limit of low frequency of the impinging radiation and low temperature , and in the effect of the impurity band on the dissipation .",
    "quantitative results are presented for the experimentally relevant dirty limit ( with respect to the nonmagnetic disorder ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : clean ] , we consider the limit of weak scattering off magnetic impurities and disregard nonmagnetic disorder ( `` clean '' limit ) . in that limit",
    ", we find the localized states bound to magnetic impurities and discuss the formation of the impurity band at finite but small concentration of magnetic impurities and the formation of the ag density of states at higher concentrations . we also present there a qualitative consideration of the dissipative conductivity .",
    "the main features of the developed simple picture carry over to the realistic case of a `` dirty '' superconductor doped with magnetic impurities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dirty ] , we consider the dirty limit for the nonmagnetic disorder in the framework of the quasiclassical formalism of the usadel equation .",
    "we first obtain the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations in the presence of magnetic impurities ( treated beyond the born approximation ) .",
    "then we address the effect of magnetic impurities on the low - temperature dissipative conductivity .",
    "in addition to the low - frequency limit , we also consider in detail the frequency dependence of the dissipation near the thresholds determined by the gaps in the excitation spectrum .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "some technical details are presented in the appendixes .",
    "to highlight the main features of the problem related to the impurity states , we consider here a simplified case of a superconductor with magnetic impurities only .",
    "in addition , considering the hybridization of single - impurity states into an impurity band we first assume magnetic impurities to be polarized ( magnetic moments pointing up the @xmath3 axis ) , while the impurity positions are random .",
    "furthermore , we assume the exchange constant @xmath4 of interaction of localized classical spins @xmath5 with the spins of itinerant electrons to be small . introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 describing the `` strength '' of a single magnetic impurity ,",
    "we can write the latter requirement as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the electron density of states ( dos ) per spin projection at the fermi level in the normal state , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the fermi wave vector and the fermi velocity , respectively .",
    "weak exchange interaction will modify substantially the excitation spectrum only close to the gap . concentrating on that energy region ,",
    "we simplify the hamiltonian of the system in the following way .",
    "first , we express the operator of exchange interaction of electrons with an impurity ( placed at origin , @xmath11 ) in terms of the bogoliubov quasiparticles ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the operators of electrons and bogoliubov quasiparticles , respectively ) : @xmath14,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are momenta and @xmath0 is the spin index ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) . at the same time , the standard bcs part of the hamiltonian becomes diagonal after the bogoliubov transformation , with the excitation energies @xmath20 in the superconducting state . here",
    "@xmath21 is the bcs gap and @xmath22 are the excitation energies in the normal state .",
    "close to the gap ( @xmath23 ) , we can approximate @xmath24 , while the bogoliubov coherence factors are simply @xmath25 , so finally the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and we measure the quasiparticle energies from the edge of the continuous spectrum @xmath21 : @xmath28      it is easy to see that hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) has a bound state for quasiparticles with spin @xmath0 satisfying the condition @xmath29 . for definiteness",
    ", hereafter we set @xmath30 ; then the bound state exists for spin down .",
    "we denote the wave function of the bound state in the momentum representation as @xmath31 ; the schrdinger equation for it , which follows from the form of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , reads @xmath32 clearly , the wave function must have the form @xmath33 . substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) , we find the equation for the energy of the bound state ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 yielding @xmath36 at @xmath37 . the power - law dependence , @xmath38 , is a direct consequence of the excitations spectrum @xmath39 . the convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sch_e ] ) at @xmath40 validates the use of the simplified form of @xmath41 .",
    "we emphasize that in order to obtain the bound state , it was essential to go beyond the born approximation.@xcite the wave function of the bound state in the coordinate representation has the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the coherence length of a clean superconductor .",
    "the wave function of the localized state decays exponentially on the spatial scale which exceeds the coherence length by the factor @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , the effect of multiple magnetic impurities on the quasiparticle spectrum depends crucially on the characteristic distance between them compared to @xmath45 . at lowest concentrations @xmath46 ,",
    "separate magnetic impurities create a @xmath47-peak in the quasiparticle dos . with the increase of the concentration the peak broadens .",
    "as long as the average inter - impurity distance is large , the broadening is due to rare occurrences of closely located impurity pairs producing split levels due to their hybridization.@xcite however , at higher concentrations , @xmath48 , the bound state on a given impurity overlaps with a large number of other localized states and forms a well - defined impurity band .",
    "this large parameter allows one to treat the dos in that band self - consistently .",
    "we start with an estimate of the impurity band width @xmath49 .",
    "a quasiparticle initially localized on a given impurity may hop on @xmath50 `` nearest neighbors '' . because of their large number , the return of the quasiparticle is improbable .",
    "therefore , we may introduce the escape rate @xmath51 for a given impurity .",
    "it will determine the level width , and we will associate it with the width of the band , @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the escape rate from a given site is proportional to the dos on the `` receiving '' ones .",
    "the latter is inversely proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "this way , the formula for the escape rate turns into a self - consistent equation for @xmath49 ( this is the essence of the self - consistent born approximation for degenerate states , analyzed in detail in the context of the broadening of high landau levels@xcite ) . to implement the scheme , we denote the hopping matrix element between two impurity states @xmath53 and @xmath54 , at positions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as @xmath57",
    ". the said self - consistency equation reads @xmath58 ( upon summing over positions @xmath54 , the dependence on @xmath53 disappears ) .",
    "the estimate of @xmath57 should be obtained from a consideration of the two - impurity problem .",
    "tunneling between two impurity sites splits the degenerate level in two .",
    "the resulting energy splitting depends on the inter - impurity distance @xmath59 . similarly to the conventional tight - binding problem",
    ", it is this energy splitting that should be identified with @xmath60 . this way",
    ", we find @xmath61 .",
    "to estimate the proportionality coefficient here , we note that the energy splitting reaches a value of the order of @xmath62 if @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 .",
    "this estimate is confirmed by a solution of the energy splitting problem , which is easily obtained by the generalization of eqs .",

    "this is why one may expect that the obtained estimate of @xmath67 remains valid in the presence of nonmagnetic disorder , as long as the corresponding mean free path is large compared to the electron fermi wave length .",
