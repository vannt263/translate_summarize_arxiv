    "flavor changing decays of heavy hadrons are of great interest in the heavy flavor physics due to their ability to provide useful information on the quark structure of the hadrons and reveal the nature of the weak interactions",
    ". in particular , the decay of the @xmath5-quark baryons can give us various charm related cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements , which are the main ingredients of the standard model .",
    "furthermore , a thorough understanding of the standard model itself needs a comprehension of the flavor changing dynamics .",
    "however , such a comprehension is difficult contemporarily since form factors characterizing those processes are nonperturbative quantities that need to be determined by some nonperturbative method .",
    "this paper aims to give a preliminary determination of the form factors of the exclusive semi - leptonic decay @xmath1 . in the calculation",
    "we will use the method of qcd sum rules on the light cone @xcite , which in the past has been successfully applied to various problems in heavy meson physics , see @xcite for a review .    the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr )",
    "is a non - perturbative method developed from the standard technique of the traditional qcd sum rules from shifman , vainshtein , and zakhavov(svz sum rules ) @xcite , which comes as the remedy for the conventional approach in which vacuum condensates carry no momentum @xcite .",
    "the main difference between svz sum rule and lcsr is that the short - distance wilson ope(operator product expansion ) in increasing dimension is replaced by the light - cone expansion in terms of distribution amplitudes ( das ) of increasing twist , which were originally used in the description of the hard exclusive process @xcite . in recent years",
    "there have been many applications of lcsr to baryons .",
    "the nucleon electromagnetic form factors were studied for the first time in refs . @xcite and later in refs .",
    "@xcite for a further consideration .",
    "several nucleon related processes gave fruitful results within lcsr , the weak decay @xmath6 was considered in both full qcd and hqet lcsr @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath7 transition form factor was worked out in ref .",
    "we have given the applications of lcsr on other @xmath8 octet baryons in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we will make use of the lcsr approach to study the decay process @xmath1 , which has been preliminarily studied in the previous work @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the present paper is to use the renewed distribution amplitudes provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , and adopt two different kinds of interpolating currents to investigate the process .",
    "this transition had been studied in the literature by several authors , employing flavor symmetry or quark model or both in refs .",
    "there are also qcd sum rule description of the form factors @xcite , upon which the total decay rate are obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the relevant @xmath0 baryon das . following that sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to the lcsrs for the semi - leptonic @xmath1 decay form factors with two kinds of interpolating currents for the @xmath9 baryon . the numerical analysis and our conclusion",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "the das presented in this subsection is the same as that in our previous work @xcite and a part of the complete results in ref .",
    "herein we only give them out for the completeness of the paper .",
    "our discussion for the @xmath0 baryon das parallels with that for the nucleon in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we just list the results following from that procedure and it is recommended to consult the original paper for details .",
    "the @xmath0 baryon das are defined through the following matrix element : @xmath10 where @xmath11 designates the spinor for the @xmath0 baryon with momentum @xmath12 . since only axial - vector das",
    "contribute to the final sum rules of the process , we merely present this kind of structures for simplicity .",
    "the twist classification of those calligraphic das is indefinite , but they can be expressed by the ones with definite twist as @xmath13 the twist classification of @xmath14 is given in table .",
    "[ twist ] .       to summarize",
    ", we have given an approved investigation on the semi - leptonic decay @xmath15 .",
    "the form factors characterizing the process are studied within the framework of the lcsr method . in the calculations we adopt both cz - type and ioffe - type current as interpolating field for the @xmath9 baryon .",
    "light - cone sum rules for the form factors are derived and used to predict the decay width , which is @xmath16 from cz - type interpolating current and @xmath17 from ioffe - type interpolating current .",
    "the results show that the adoption of the ioffe - type interpolating current is in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that in the case when ioffe - type interpolator is used , terms proportional to the mass of the heavy quark appearing in the sum rules ( [ sr - ioffe ] ) can play an important role in the numerical analysis .",
    "in addition , the analyses also show that the higher twist contributions are important for the results so that they need to be included in the calculation .",
