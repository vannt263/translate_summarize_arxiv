    "the description of low - energy meson - baryon interaction in the strange sector is a highly puzzling problem .",
    "the direct application of the effective theory approach @xcite , which was successful in the pion - nucleon sector , i.e. , baryonic chiral perturbation theory ( for review see @xcite ) , is problematic .",
    "the key physical issue is the presence of the @xmath2 resonance below the @xmath3-@xmath4 threshold @xcite .",
    "the existence of a resonance implies the need to work to all orders in perturbation theory and therefore procedures alternative to standard @xmath5pt are required .",
    "a possible way to proceed is via the multi - channel lippmann - schwinger equation with the interaction described by separable potentials @xcite .",
    "the physics based on chiral symmetry of qcd is reflected in the design of the respective separable potentials .",
    "they are designed to match the amplitudes obtained in chiral perturbation theory up to given order @xmath6 . in the hypothetical world of very low - quark masses , amplitudes obtained by iterating the lippmann - schwinger equation with such potentials are equal to the amplitudes derived in @xmath5pt up to a given order in the chiral expansion @xmath6 .",
    "note that the @xmath5pt is constructed as an effective theory of qcd in the regime of low momenta and low quark masses .",
    "however , in the physical world with a relatively high @xmath7 quark mass , the connection to the fundamental theory of strong interactions  the quantum chromodymanics  is more subtle .",
    "the suggested approach has , on the other hand , the advantage that the lippmann - schwinger equation is exactly solvable ; the originally complicated system of coupled integral equations simplifies to an algebraic equation and a set of integrals .",
    "additionally , some features of nuclear medium , for example , pauli blocking @xcite and/or self - energy effects @xcite can be straightforwardly incorporated into the separable potential model .",
    "kaon - nucleon amplitudes enriched with in - medium effects may then be used to determine an effective in - medium kaon - nuclear potential @xcite , as well as to study other low - energy processes involving kaon - nuclear interaction , for example , the hypernuclear production @xcite .    in their recent work , ciepl and smejkal @xcite",
    "were able to fit a large set of low - energy experimental data ( threshold branching ratios , kaonic hydrogen shift and width , cross sections to various channels for kaon incident momentum up to 200 mev ) with a very simple model combining the chiral dynamics with separable potential approach considering only the @xmath8 partial wave .",
    "they were also able to analyze the properties of @xmath2 resonance .",
    "however , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite has an important limitation ",
    "it considers only the s - wave contribution .",
    "although this turned out to be sufficient for the kaon incident momentum up to 200 mev , the inclusion of higher partial waves becomes necessary if one wants to go to higher kaon momenta .",
    "moreover , the p - wave interaction is expected to play an important role in the formation of deeply bound @xmath9-nuclear states @xcite .",
    "although the authors of @xcite used the more fundamental model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the s - wave interaction , they relied on purely phenomenological parametrization for p - wave interaction .",
    "thus , the improvement of the understanding of the p - wave part of meson - baryon interaction in the strange sector is certainly desirable .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend the separable potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite for meson - baryon interactions in the strange sector to include the effects of the p - wave . with",
    "the p - wave part included in the separable potential , one should gain access to phenomena which are inaccessible if only s - wave is included , for example , the angular distribution of the cross section .",
    "moreover , one might expect that the p - wave resonance @xmath1 could be dynamically generated using the p - wave potential in a similar way as @xmath2 , as was studied by ciepl and smejkal .",

    "4 , the potential for kaon - proton scattering is constructed to match the @xmath5pt up to lowest nontrivial order .",
    "fits to the available experimental data and discussion of obtained results follows in the sec .",
    "in this section , the formalism describing two - particle scattering  one with spin one - half and one with spin zero  is summarized . to be concrete , only the interactions that are both time - reversal and parity invariant are considered ; all formulas are given in the center - of - mass frame of reference .",
    "the most general form of the scattering amplitude is a @xmath10 spin matrix @xcite : @xmath11 in ( [ amplgeneral ] ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for the initial and final cms momentum .",
    "a hat above a vector indicates a unit vector in the respective direction . the spin non - flip and spin flip amplitudes",
    "are denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    due to parity invariance ,",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath16 and orbital angular momentum @xmath17 are separately conserved during the scattering .",
    "thus , for a given initial orbital momentum @xmath17 ( a given partial wave ) , there are two independent s - matrix elements  one for @xmath18 , and one for @xmath19that fully characterize the scattering process .",

    "however , the non - relativistic baryon propagator @xmath61 is of order @xmath62 making the leading behavior of the diagram to be @xmath59 .",
    "these diagrams represent the leading order contribution to the p - wave amplitudes .",
    "some of the amplitudes may be found in the literature @xcite , and all of them can be reconstructed from the potentials that will be presented below .",

    "since the s- and p - waves are considered in the model , two form factors are needed ; one for @xmath8 and one for @xmath28 . for simplicity ,",
    "yamaguchi - type form factors @xcite are used in the calculation : @xmath65 @xmath66 characterize the the range of the interaction in the particular channel .    the use of ( [ seppotentiall01 ] ) , ( [ vtom ] ) , ( [ yamff0 ] ) , and ( [ yamff1 ] ) immediately leads to the potentials @xmath67 .",

    "a brief comment about the @xmath77 potentials is in order . in the leading order amplitude in @xmath5pt ,",
    "there is a sum of meson energies @xmath78 in the denominator .",
    "however , it leads to a possible unphysical divergence in the deep subthreshold region .",
    "this divergence is trackable back to the form of the fully relativistic baryon propagator , which diverges for @xmath79 .",
    "the complication here is due to the fact that the calculation is restricted solely to the tree diagrams at the level of @xmath5pt .",
    "this divergence , eventually , disappears if one continues to higher orders . in the presented model ,",
    "the spurious divergence is avoided by replacing the meson energy @xmath80 by meson mass @xmath81 wherever it appears in the denominator , as was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the potential for the s - wave @xmath82 part is identical to the leading part of the potential used by ciepl and smejkal @xcite and kaiser et al . @xcite .",
    "the p - wave contribution @xmath83 , @xmath72 has not been considered by these authors .",
    "the comparison of the chirally motivated separable potential model from the previous section to the experimental low - energy data is presented and discussed here .",
    "the model developed in the previous section contains , in its full complexity , a substantial number of free parameters .",
    "for example , there are in principle 20 different inverse range parameters @xmath84 characterizing form factors @xmath85 ( [ yamff0 ] ) , ( [ yamff1 ] ) .",
    "more parameters would appear if one considers the second order chiral lagrangian .",
    "however , it is useful to keep the analysis simple and straightforward . thus , the model is restricted to the first order chiral lagrangian and the same inverse range parameter is used for all channels : @xmath86 for the s - wave form factors ( [ yamff0 ] ) , and @xmath87 for the p - wave form factors ( [ yamff1 ] ) . in the leading order @xmath5pt , the decay constant @xmath88 is the same for all mesons in the pseudoscalar octet ( pions , kaons , @xmath89 ) ; its value is not constrained experimentally and is thus subject to fit .",
    "overall , there are three free parameters to be specified : inverse ranges @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 controlling the strength of the interaction .    from the point of view of the partial wave analysis ,",
    "the low - energy experimental data may be divided into three subcategories .",
    "first , the threshold branching ratios @xcite and kaonic hydrogen properties @xcite are influenced entirely by the s - wave physics .",
    "cross sections are influenced by both s- and p - waves ( and , naturally , higher partial waves as energy of the collision increases ) , yet they are non - zero even if the p - wave is neglected . and finally , properties of the angular distribution of the differential cross sections require the presence of the p - wave . all of them are considered in the analysis . since the @xmath90 , which is a d - wave resonance , emerges at the kaon incident momentum around 400 mev , the validity of the model containing only s- and p - wave is certainly limited to below this value ; this paper considers only the scattering data up to 300 mev @xcite , since there is both a significant effect of the p - wave while the d - wave is expected to be negligible .",
    "the key novelty of this paper is the focus on the effects of p - wave interaction , therefore the attention is given to angular distribution of the differential cross section .",
    "the asymmetry in the angular distribution , which is parameterized by the quantity @xmath91 ( [ assymetries_formula ] ) , begins to be observable at kaon incident momenta above 200 mev @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on angular distributions are , unfortunately , very imprecise and available only for channels @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .    in the fitting of free parameters ,",
    "a simple minimization of @xmath96 is problematic ; the @xmath96 fit weights most importantly the data points that are most precise . in this case , the threshold branching ratios , whose uncertainties are orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainties of other data points , would dominate the fit , whereas the properties of angular distribution , which depend dominantly on p - wave physics , would be almost irrelevant because their uncertainties are big . since the main focus of this paper is the p - wave interaction , the following procedure , which emphasizes the p - wave physics , is adopted . first , the threshold characteristics and total cross section at low kaon momenta ( at 100 mev for @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , at 110 mev for @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , and at 120 mev for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ) are fitted with only the s - wave interaction taken into account .",
    "it is justified by the fact that the p - wave interaction is negligible for such low energies . in this procedure , the free parameters controlling the s - wave interaction , @xmath86 and @xmath88 , are set .",
    "next , with the s - wave potential fixed , the total cross sections at higher kaon momentum ( 300 mev for all channels ) and asymmetries in the angular distribution ( @xmath91 for momenta 225 , 250 , 275 , and 300 mev for channels @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) are fitted with full potential in order to get the @xmath87 .",
    "best results were obtained for the following values of free parameters : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ; the overall @xmath102 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath103 is well above 1 is not a problem because the presented model does not aspire to be the complete description of nature .",
    "the comparison with experimental data is summarized in table [ table_res2 ] , and figs . [ asymetries]-[resonances ] .",
