    "during cell life , membranes are submitted to an inhomogeneous and variable environment .",
    "local inhomogeneities can be strongly related to biological processes , which has led to experiments investigating the effect of local modifications on biomimetic membranes  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the inner membrane of mitochondria , the enzymes that use the local ph difference across the membrane to synthesize adenosine triphosphate , the cell s fuel , are located in membrane invaginations called cristae  @xcite .",
    "experiments on model lipid membranes have shown that a local ph change can induce a local dynamical membrane deformation  @xcite , and in particular the formation of cristae - like invaginations  @xcite : membrane shape is tightly coupled to local ph inhomogeneities .",
    "other concentration inhomogeneities in the environment of a cell have a crucial biological role , for instance in chemotaxis or in paracrine signaling .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to study the response of a biological membrane to a local modification of its environment .    motivated by experiments conducted on biomimetic membranes ,",
    "we have developed a theoretical description of the dynamics of a lipid bilayer membrane submitted to a local concentration increase of a substance that reacts reversibly and instantaneously with the membrane lipid headgroups .",
    "we focus on the regime of small deformations , and we treat linear membrane dynamics in the spirit of ref .  @xcite .",
    "while our first works focused on the simple case of a constant modification of the membrane involving only one wavelength  @xcite , we have recently extended our theoretical description in order to take into account the spatiotemporal profile of the fraction of chemically modified lipids resulting from the local reagent concentration increase  @xcite .",
    "this profile is determined by the diffusion of the reagent in the solution that surrounds the membrane . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compared the predictions of this theoretical description to experimental measurements of the deformation of the membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles caused by local microinjection of a basic solution , and we obtained good agreement between theory and experiment .    in the present article , we pursue the theoretical investigation of the effect of a local chemical modification on a lipid membrane . in general , the dynamics that results from a local reagent concentration increase is quite complex , as it involves the evolution of the reagent concentration profile simultaneously as the response of the membrane .",
    "this is the case in the experimental data analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to microinjection steps lasting a few seconds . here",
    ", we show that the effect of the evolution of the reagent concentration profile on the membrane dynamics becomes negligible some time after the beginning of the reagent concentration increase , after what the dynamics corresponds to the response of the membrane to a chemical modification imposed instantaneously .",
    "we find that studying this regime enables to extract interesting properties of the membrane response .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec",
    ".  [ mbr_dyn ] , we review the linear dynamics of a membrane submitted to a local chemical modification .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ res ] , we study separately the dynamics associated with each of the two effects that can arise from a chemical modification , namely a spontaneous curvature change and an equilibrium density change of the external monolayer .",
    "we find that a local asymmetric density perturbation between the two monolayers of the membrane relaxes by spreading diffusively in the whole membrane .",
    "intermonolayer friction plays a crucial part in this behavior .",
    "subsequently , in sec .  [ res_b ]",
    ", we treat the general case where both effects are present , and we show how the ratio of the spontaneous curvature change to the equilibrium density change induced by the local chemical modification can be extracted from the dynamics .",
    "this ratio can not be deduced from the study of global modifications of vesicle equilibrium shapes in light of the area - difference elasticity model  @xcite .",

    "for the article to be self - contained , the present section reviews the linear dynamics of a membrane submitted to a local chemical modification , starting from first principles .",
    "the main points of this description were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that article , we compared theoretical predictions to experimental measurements of the deformation of a membrane submitted to a local and brief ph increase . here , our aim will be to go further in the analysis of our theoretical description in order to understand the fundamental properties of the response of a membrane to a local chemical modification .",
    "our description of the bilayer membrane is based on a local version of the area - difference elasticity membrane model  @xcite .",
    "we focus on small deformations of an infinite flat membrane , and we denote the upper monolayer by  @xmath0 and the lower one by  @xmath1 .    in the absence of a chemical modification , the local state of each monolayer is described by two variables : the local total curvature @xmath2 defined on the membrane midlayer , which is common to both monolayers , and the local scaled density @xmath3 , defined on the midlayer of the membrane , @xmath4 being a reference density . the sign convention for the curvature",
    "is chosen in such a way that a spherical vesicle has @xmath5 .",
    "the free energy @xmath6 per unit area in monolayer @xmath7 reads  @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the tension of the bilayer and @xmath10 its bending modulus , while @xmath11 is the stretching modulus of a monolayer , and @xmath12 denotes the distance between the neutral surface  @xcite of a monolayer and the midsurface of the bilayer . as we assume that the two monolayers of the membrane are identical before the chemical modification , these constants are the same for both monolayers .",
    "the spontaneous curvatures of the two monolayers have the same absolute value @xmath13 and opposite signs , since their lipids are oriented in opposite directions .",
    "the expression for @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ fpm0 ] ) corresponds to a general second - order expansion in the small dimensionless local variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 , around the reference state which corresponds to a flat membrane with uniform density @xmath16 .",
    "it is valid for small deformations around this reference state : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a small dimensionless parameter used for bookkeeping purposes , which characterizes the amplitude of the small deformations of the membrane around the reference state .",
    "mathematically , @xmath19 is considered infinitesimal .",
    "note that in general , both @xmath2 and @xmath14 , which describe local small deformations around the reference state , are functions of time and of position on the membrane .",

    "we consider that the reagent source , which corresponds to the micropipette tip in an experiment , is localized in the water above the membrane .",

    "in fact , in the present work , the deformation of the membrane and the density variation are caused by the local chemical modification , i.e. , they are a response to @xmath20 , which justifies that @xmath28 and @xmath14 are of the same order as @xmath20 .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ fpm0 ] ) and  ( [ fmod ] ) .",
    "the effect of the chemical modification ( i.e. , of @xmath20 ) on the upper monolayer is twofold .",
    "first , the scaled equilibrium density on the neutral surface of the upper monolayer is changed by the amount @xmath29 to first order .",
    "second , the spontaneous curvature of the upper monolayer is changed by the amount @xmath30 to first order , with @xmath31 .",
    "these results are obtained by minimization of the free energy of a homogeneous monolayer with constant mass ( see  [ ap_sc_dens ] ) .",
    "hence , the constants @xmath24 and @xmath32 describe the linear response of the monolayer equilibrium density and of its spontaneous curvature , respectively , to the chemical modification .",
    "this explains the physical meaning of the constants @xmath24 and @xmath26 in eq .",

    "@xcite to first order in @xmath19 , using the principle of virtual work . as we focus on small deformations of an infinite flat membrane , it is convenient to describe it in the monge gauge by the height @xmath33 , @xmath34 , of its midlayer with respect to the reference plane @xmath35",
    ". then , @xmath36 to second order .",
    "such a description is adapted to practical cases where the distance between the reagent source and the membrane is much smaller than the vesicle radius .",
    "the force per unit area of the reference plane , which we call `` force density '' , then reads to first order in @xmath19 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the tangential component of the force density in monolayer ",
    "@xmath7 \" , while @xmath39 is the total normal force density in the membrane . in these formulas , we have introduced the antisymmetric scaled density @xmath40 , and the constant @xmath41 .",
    "these expressions show that both the equilibrium density change and the spontaneous curvature change ( i.e. , both @xmath24 and @xmath32 ) can yield a normal force density , and thus a deformation of the membrane , while only the equilibrium density change can yield a tangential force density and induce tangential lipid flow .",
    "an illustration of the role of these force densities in the membrane response to a local chemical modification is provided in fig .",

    "some lipids of monolayer @xmath0 are modified : they are represented in dark blue ( @xmath20 represents their local mass fraction ; for clarity @xmath20 is locally large in the figure , but in our work , @xmath21 ) . here",
    "we assume that the result of the chemical modification is to increase the effective size of their headgroups .",
    "hence , the equilibrium density in monolayer @xmath0 is locally decreased ( @xmath42 ) , while the spontaneous curvature is increased in absolute value ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this results into a normal force density @xmath44 at the center of the modified zone of the membrane ( see eq .",

    "note that tangential flows also appear due to tangential force densities.[mem_fig ] ]    using the elastic force densities in eqs .",
    "( [ pip_b][pn_b ] ) , it is possible to describe the dynamics of the membrane to first order in the spirit of ref .",
    "let us outline the derivation of these equations  @xcite , which is described in more detail in  [ apeq ] .",
    "we use a normal force balance for the bilayer ( see  [ ap_mbdyn ] ) , which involves @xmath47 and the normal viscous stress exerted by the surrounding fluid , which is derived in  [ ap_hyd ] .",
    "besides , as each monolayer is a two - dimensional fluid , we write down generalized stokes equations ( see  [ ap_mbdyn ] ) , which involve @xmath38 , the two - dimensional viscous stress associated with the lipid flow , the tangential viscous stress exerted by the surrounding fluid ( see  [ ap_hyd ] ) , and the intermonolayer friction @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the velocity in monolayer @xmath7 and @xmath50 is the intermonolayer friction coefficient  @xcite .",
    "this intermonolayer friction is a tangential force that comes into play when one monolayer slides relatively to the other one .",
    "finally , we use mass conservation in each monolayer . these dynamical equations are best expressed using two - dimensional fourier transforms of the various fields involved , denoted with hats : for any field @xmath51 which depends on @xmath52 and on time @xmath53 , @xmath54 is such that @xmath55 combining all the above - mentioned equations yields a system of first - order linear differential equations on the two - dimensional variable @xmath56 : @xmath57 where we have introduced the matrix which describes the dynamical response of the membrane  @xcite : @xmath58 here , we have assumed that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is true for all the wavevectors with significant weight in @xmath61 , if the modified lipid mass fraction @xmath20 has a smooth profile with a characteristic width larger than 1 @xmath62 m .",

    ", the symmetry breaking is caused by the chemical modification of certain membrane lipids in the external monolayer , i.e. , to the presence of @xmath20 . and",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ ed_defs_2 ] ) shows that the forcing term in eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) is proportional to @xmath67 .      before solving eq .",
    "( [ ed ] ) , we need to determine @xmath68 , which is involved in the forcing term @xmath69 . the profile @xmath70 of the mass fraction of chemically modified lipids in the external monolayer arises from the local reagent concentration increase . we focus on reagents that react reversibly with the membrane lipid headgroups . besides , we assume that the reaction between the lipids and the reagent is diffusion - controlled ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in other words , the molecular reaction timescales are very small compared to the diffusion timescales .",
    "for such a reversible diffusion - controlled chemical reaction , @xmath70 is instantaneously determined by the local reagent concentration on the membrane , which results from the diffusion of the reagent in the fluid above the membrane .",
    "note that these hypotheses are verified in the experiments analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the reagent is sodium hydroxide .",
    "we consider that the reagent source is localized in @xmath71 , which would represent the position of the micropipette tip in an experiment ( see ref .",

    "we focus on the regime of small deformations @xmath73 , and we work at first order in @xmath74 . besides , we study the linear regime where @xmath75 is proportional to the reagent concentration on the membrane : denoting by @xmath76 the reagent concentration field , we have @xmath77 . to first order in the membrane deformation , this can be simplified into @xmath78 .",
    "the field @xmath79 is determined by the diffusion of the reagent from the local source in the fluid above the membrane . in microinjection experiments ,",
    "there is also a convective transport of the reagent due to the injection , but the pclet number remains so small that diffusion dominates .",
    "besides , since the membrane is a surface and @xmath80 , we can neglect the number of reagent molecules that react with the membrane when calculating @xmath79 . hence , @xmath79 can be obtained by solving the diffusion equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the diffusion coefficient of the reagent in the fluid above the membrane , and the source term reads @xmath83 where @xmath84 is heaviside s function .",
    "this corresponds to a constant injection flow from the source starting at @xmath85 .",
