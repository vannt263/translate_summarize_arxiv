    "it is currently de rigueur to examine , both experimentally and theoretically , the structure of materials subjected to extremely high pressures.@xcite the semi - metals , which include arsenic , are of particular interest as they all exhibit a distinctive low - symmetry structure when uncompressed . with pressure , these elements experience transitions into structures of higher symmetry , with unusual intermediate phases  incommensurate or _ host - guest _ structures  occurring along the way .",
    "the computational study of the high - pressure behavior of materials necessitates the ability to properly examine displacive phase transitions from one structure to another .",
    "some structural phase transitions are straight - forward enough that the transition pressure can be determined by looking at where the enthalpy - pressure curves of the two structures cross , or by using the technique of the `` common tangent '' on the energy - volume curves of the two structures .",
    "however , the transition pressure can not be determined in this way if the enthalpy - pressure ( or energy - volume ) curves of the two structures merge , as in the case of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition of arsenic ( and for the same transition in the other semi - metals ) .",
    "so if the phase transition between the two structures is a smooth one  such that the energy differences between the two structures in the region of the transition are extremely small  then how should such a transition be studied ?",
    "high levels of convergence of the calculation of the quantities of interest are crucial .    in the past , the a7  @xmath0  sc transition pressure of arsenic has been the subject of experimental as well as theoretical dispute .",
    "experimentally , there has been a long - standing question as to whether results obtained by beister  @xcite for this transition pressure are correct over those of kikegawa and iwasaki  @xcite  our results support the findings of the former .",
    "existing theoretical studies of arsenic yield a wide range of possible values for the transition pressure .",
    "we believe that a great part of the reason for this spread of values is inadequate sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface of arsenic is extremely complex : using values reported by lin and falicov  @xcite for the cross - sectional area of a _ neck _ ( the finest feature of the hole fermi surface ) , we estimate that to sample the fermi surface of arsenic at ambient pressures such that all of the features can be resolved  and are subsequently correctly weighted  a grid of at least 140@xmath2140@xmath2140 would be required . in practice , it is not necessary to use grids as dense as this but one would not know this without proper and thorough convergence testing with respect to grid size and amount of smearing used .",
    "as no such convergence testing of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition of arsenic appears in the literature , results of computational studies to date are unreliable and any agreement with experiment has been fortuitous .",
    "we undertake indepth studies of the convergence properties of this transition,@xcite which enable us to proffer reliably converged results .",
    "this investigation is not only timely , given the current levels of interest in the field of high - pressure research , but it is also especially relevant to the study of pressure - induced insulator to metal or semi - metal to metal phase transitions . in particular , we find that inspection of such transitions demands careful convergence of the quantities of interest with respect to sampling and smearing , yet such testing is not always performed .",
    "using density functional theory ( dft ) to study the high - pressure properties of materials furthermore necessitates an awareness of how different approximations to the exchange - correlation functional perform at such a task ; to understand the differences encountered in the use of these functionals is in itself a motivation for undertaking theoretical investigations of materials at high pressures.@xcite we thus compare the performance of the lda with that of two gga functionals , having achieved accurate results for each .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains the background material that pertains to our study , including a description of the a7 phase , a review of the structural transformation that yields the sc phase when a sufficiently high external pressure is applied , and a survey of the relevant findings published prior to this work .",
    "section iii deals with the computational details of our calculations . in sec .",
    "iv , we present and discuss our results , contrasting them against those that appear in the literature .",
    "we begin by examining , using the nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances , the overall picture of the pressure - dependence of the phases of arsenic for the lda and the gga cases ; the pressure - dependence of the lattice parameters is also explored .",
    "next we focus on the a7  @xmath0  sc transition in particular , discussing it in more detail using energy - volume and pressure - volume curves . in sec .",
    "v , we provide a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "at ambient pressures , arsenic is a covalently bonded compound existing in the rhombohedral ( a7 ) phase .",
    "the a7 phase , belonging to space group  166 , is a low - symmetry , three - fold coordinated , layered structure ( fig .  [ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "nearest neighbors exist within a common layer ; bonding between nearest neighbors gives the structure its buckled appearance .",
    "adjacent layers , which contain next - nearest neighbors , are weakly bonded .",
    "the stacking of the layers occurs in the [ 111 ] direction , as does the buckling .",
    "direction is out of the page in the top portion of the figure ; in the bottom portion of the figure it lies in the plane of the page and points upward . and colors of atoms depicted carry no significance , but are employed merely to illustrate the abc stacking of the a7 structure of arsenic .",
    "( b ) the a7 structure consists of layers of 6-member buckled rings as displayed by the hexagon composed of green arsenic atoms .",
    "the buckled appearance of arsenic is due to the bonding of nearest neighbors that occurs within each of the layers ; the layers themselves are only weakly bonded .",
    "nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances are illustrated using the red atoms and are measured with respect to the black atom .",
    "nearest neighbor distances exist between red and black atoms within the same layer ; next - nearest neighbor distances exist between red and black atoms from adjacent layers .",
    "the two - atom rhombohedral unit cell is also displayed .",
    "( this figure was created in part using atomeye.@xcite ) ]    the rhombohedral primitive cell of arsenic contains two atoms and is described by the length of the primitive lattice vectors , @xmath3 , the angle , @xmath4 , between each set of primitive lattice vectors , and by the atomic positional parameter , @xmath5 , which determines the positions of the two atoms along the cell s body diagonal .",
    "the two atoms are located at ( wyckoff ) positions @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite along the primitive lattice vectors , where the atomic positional parameter @xmath5 is a fractional coordinate .",
    "together , @xmath4 and @xmath5 characterize the degree of buckling experienced by the a7 structure .",
    "the a7 structure can be interpreted as a distortion of the six - fold coordinated sc structure;@xcite a diagram charting the evolution of the sc structure into the a7 structure can be found in ref .  .",
    "the sc lattice can be viewed as being composed of two interpenetrating face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices .",
    "the vertices of a sc cell along the [ 111 ] direction contain one atom from each of the fcc lattices .",
    "a rhombohedral cell is superimposed onto this in such a way that its origin lies central to , and contains , two of these alternate fcc lattice atoms .",
    "its body diagonal is along the [ 111 ] direction ( the trigonal axis ) . along this direction",
    ", the atomic positional parameter @xmath5 can be thought of as the ratio of the distance from the origin to the first atom , divided by the length of the body diagonal .",
    "a shear is then applied along the trigonal axis so that the angle @xmath4 between sets of primitive lattice vectors decreases from its simple cubic value of @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the two atoms are displaced from their original positions and away from each other such that @xmath5 decreases from its sc value of 0.25 .",
    "the periodicity of the atoms in the [ 111 ] direction is now doubled ; pairs of atoms in this direction repeat a pattern of being further apart and then nearer . in this way",
    ", the coordination number is reduced from six to three , as is consistent with the tendency of semi - metals at normal pressures to form three bonds .",
    "subjected to sufficiently high pressures , arsenic undergoes a transition from semi - metallic a7 to metallic sc . at lower pressures ,",
    "the stability of the a7 structure against that of the sc structure can be understood in terms of a peierls - type distortion associated with the displacement of the atoms along the [ 111 ] direction from their original positions within the simple cubic lattice .",
    "this displacement corresponds to the longitudinal acoustic phonon mode at the point @xmath9 on the boundary of the simple cubic brillouin zone.@xcite the breaking of symmetry causes a lowering of the energy of the electron states near the fermi level , with the result that a gap is opened up , the band contribution to the total energy is reduced , and the structure is stabilized against the distortion . as the pressure is increased , ionic effects become more significant , and the ewald contribution to the total energy increases . changes in the ewald energy",
    "eventually dominate over changes in the band energy , the a7 structure is destabilized such that the ewald energy is lowered , and the sc structure is recovered.@xcite within the framework of chemical bonding , at low pressures the nearly orthogonal bonds of the a7 structure indicate weak s - p hybridization , where valence electrons are localized within saturated covalent bonds .",
    "the splitting between s and p bands increases with pressure , until the s band is so deeply depressed with respect to the p band that unsaturated orthogonal bonds form , resulting in the metallic sc structure.@xcite    it is sometimes convenient to use the nonprimitive hexagonal ( trigonal ) representation of the unit cell of arsenic .",
    "the trigonal cell is described by the lattice vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the trigonal axis which lies in the [ 111 ] direction and coincides with the body diagonal of the rhombohedral primitive cell , and by the same atomic positional parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the six atoms contained within the cell are located at wyckoff positions @xmath12.@xcite the lattice vector lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related to the length of the primitive lattice vector @xmath3 and angle @xmath4 as follows : @xmath15 , and @xmath16\\}^{1/2}$ ] . within this representation ,",
    "@xmath5 can be thought of as locating , as a fraction of @xmath11 , the first atom from the origin along this axis .    from ambient conditions and with increasing pressure , the experimentally observed transition sequence for the phases of arsenic is , where bcc is the body - centered cubic phase and is an incommensurate structure . in the literature ,",
    "the values reported for the pressure at which occurs the first structural transition of arsenic , from semi - metallic rhombohedral to metallic simple cubic , are spread out over a range of approximately 20  gpa .",
    "it has been theoretically predicted that arsenic should undergo a structural phase transition at 18  gpa;@xcite early numerical studies of arsenic yielded for the transition pressure values of 35  gpa @xcite and 19  gpa.@xcite this last result corresponded to @xmath17 ( and was indeed found again very recently in a study of the lattice dynamics of arsenic to be the volume ratio at which a transition occurs @xcite ) , where @xmath18 is the volume of the compressed cell and @xmath19 is the uncompressed equilibrium volume .",
    "investigating the pressure - induced superconductivity of arsenic , the experimental findings of kawamura and wittig @xcite suggest a transition at 24  gpa , while those of chen ,  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite support a transition pressure of 32  gpa , though they obtain 36  gpa via the theoretical component of their study .",
    "performing energy - dispersive and angle - dispersive powder x - ray diffraction studies of arsenic up to 45  gpa , kikegawa and iwasaki @xcite determined the a7  @xmath0  sc transition to be of first order , occurring somewhere in the interval of and resulting in a cell volume discontinuity of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the difference in the cell volume across transition , and @xmath22 is the volume of the cell just prior to the transition .",
    "conducting an angle - dispersive powder x - ray diffraction study up to 33  gpa in addition to a raman investigation , concluded that the transition occurs at 25  gpa , and that to within their experimental uncertainty no discernable change in volume is seen to occur : @xmath23 .",
    "more recently , theoretical investigations of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition of arsenic yielded for the transition pressure a range of @xmath24  gpa @xcite in one study , and 28  gpa @xcite in another . a molecular dynamics simulation of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition performed by durandurdu @xcite yielded a transition pressure of 35  gpa and a volume discontinuity of @xmath25 , and most recently , transition pressures of 22  gpa @xcite and 26.3  gpa @xcite have been found , with volume discontinuities of 0.8% and 0.4% respectively .",
    "experiments aimed at investigating the higher - pressure phase transitions of arsenic were first carried out by energy - dispersive powder diffraction experiments on arsenic up to 122  gpa yielded sc  @xmath0   and  @xmath0  bcc transition pressures of 48@xmath111  gpa and 97@xmath114  gpa , respectively . to within their experimental error of 1@xmath26 , no measurable volume discontinuities for either phase transition were observed .",
    "these results were reproduced rather closely in a theoretical study by hussermann ,  _ et al._,@xcite in which the two pressures were found to be 43  gpa and 97  gpa .",
    "reinterpration of diffraction patterns obtained in the experiments of led iwasaki @xcite ( see also ref .  ) to suggest a tetragonal -type or -type structure , regarded as distorted bcc , for the phase .",
    "more recently using angle - dispersive diffraction techniques , determined both the and phases to be -type structures , consisting of a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) _ host _ structure containing a bct _ guest _ component that is incommensurate with the host along the tetragonal @xmath27 axis .",
    "they suggested that a modification of this structure in which the host component is bct and the guest is monoclinic would be appropriate for . later found that the structure closely resembles that of , and proposed that it is possible that arsenic may undergo an incommensurate - to - incommensurate transition between the and bcc phases similar to the  @xmath0   transition observed in their study",
    "all calculations were performed using the castep code.@xcite for the exchange - correlation functional , we use the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite as parametrized by perdew and zunger , @xcite the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation ( abbreviated as gga - pbe)@xcite and the perdew - wang generalized gradient approximation ( gga - pw91).@xcite    the interaction between the core and valence states of arsenic is described using scalar - relativistic ultra - soft pseudopotentials.@xcite for the calculations to proceed efficiently , such pseudopotentials require the use of two : a _ standard _ grid , which is used to represent the pseudo wave - functions , and a _ fine _ grid , which is used to store the charge density , and thus the ultra - soft augmentation charge .",
    "the size of the standard grid is determined by the _ cut - off energy _  the maximum energy accounted for in the plane - wave expansion of the wave - functions ; the fine grid must be chosen dense enough such that the charge - density within the atomic cores is reproduced with sufficient detail  this is a requirement to ensure well - converged forces and stresses .",
    "convergence tests on our system at atmospheric pressure led us to choose a cut - off energy of 450  ev ; we chose our fine grid to be twice as dense as our standard grid . with these choices ,",
    "our energies , forces and stresses are converged to within 0.003  ev / atom , 0.001  ev /  and 0.01  gpa , respectively .",
    "we apply pressures between 0  gpa and 200  gpa to the two - atom rhombohedral unit cell of arsenic , allowing cell lengths and angles in addition to atomic positions to vary . for each applied pressure",
    ", the enthalpy is minimized such that the system is relaxed from the structure that exists at atmospheric pressure as determined experimentally by schiferl.@xcite the geometry optimizations are made to continue until the differences in the forces and stresses between iterations are less than 0.005  ev /  and 0.05  gpa , respectively .",
    "proper convergence studies in electronic structure calculations are important and the lack of such testing can lead to severe inaccuracies.@xcite accordingly , we have thoroughly investigated the structural convergence of our system in the region of the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition ; we have examined the convergence with respect to grid size and amount of cold - smearing @xcite used  the results of this convergence testing can be found in the supplementary material provided.@xcite in the vicinity of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition , the grids that have been studied are @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is 24 , 25 , 26 , 33 , 50 and 66 ( all grids are unshifted , so that the gamma point has been included in the calculations ) , using cold - smearings of 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.5  ev in the lda and 0.1  ev in the gga - pbe . at pressures outside the region of this phase transition ( and for all pressures studied in the case of the gga - pw91 ) , a grid of 33@xmath233@xmath233 is used , along with a cold - smearing of 0.1  ev .",
    "the symmetry of the initial a7 structure is maintained throughout the relaxation , as a highly symmetric path is assumed for the a7  @xmath0  sc transition , with atoms moving only along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "although it is irrelevant whether this assumption is valid for the phase , because no attempt has been made here to properly model this incommensurate structure , it seems reasonable that imposing these constraints on the symmetry of the system will not affect the transition pressures observed since the incommensurate phase is bounded by two phases of higher symmetry than the original a7 structure .",
    "finally , all calculations are performed at @xmath30k , and the zero - point vibrational energy , as well as the spin - orbit interaction , are neglected .",
    "we first take an overview of the behavior of the nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances as the pressure is increased from 0  gpa to 200  gpa .",
    "it has already been stated that for the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition in particular , the behavior of these two quantities gives the clearest indication of when a structural phase transition has occurred .",
    "[ fig : nnn_and_nn ] reveals the results we obtained for each of the exchange - correlation functionals studied , and includes separate close - ups of the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition for the lda and for the gga .",
    "indeed , it is quite clear when this transition occurs in all cases , as it happens when the nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances become equal . from the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : nnn_and_nn ] , we can conclude that the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition of arsenic occurs at 21@xmath11  gpa in the lda , at 28@xmath11  gpa in the gga - pbe and at 29@xmath11  gpa in the gga - pw91 ( note that the difference in the transition pressure that arises from the use of the gga - pw91 over the gga - pbe is negligible as it is within the uncertainty of 1  gpa ) .",
    "this result is more consistent with the experimental findings of who found the phase transition to occur at 25@xmath11  gpa , than it is with those of kikegawa and iwasaki,@xcite who found it to occur in the range of  gpa ; it furthermore disagrees with the outcome of simulations performed recently by durandurdu.@xcite        from this same figure we note incidentally that the gga nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances are always larger than those resulting from the lda .",
    "this is due to the well - known fact that the lda tends to overbind systems , whereas the gga tends to underbind them.@xcite thus cell volumes , cell parameters , and distances contained within the cell will tend to be lower for the lda than for the gga .",
    "our unit cell contains two atoms and is periodically repeated . we can not hope to say anything about the incommensurate phase that occurs in the pressure - induced progression of phases of arsenic , and it is not our intention to do so in this paper ; to acknowledge this point , we will use the abbreviation _ incomm . _ to represent what we find between the sc and bcc phases , and subsequently write the progression of phases as .",
    "we mention as an aside that we have chosen to work with the two - atom unit cell of arsenic in the interest of undertaking efficient calculations , but as we are guided by experiment and not primarily focused in this study on the incommensurate structure , a two - atom unit cell is sufficient for our needs .",
    "it is possible that were we to use unit cells containing arbitrary numbers of atoms we might discover other more complex or more closely - packed structures of arsenic at pressures higher than have yet been attained experimentally  this is an interesting point and although outside the scope of this work , would be an excellent candidate for the application of fully randomized structure prediction.@xcite    having stated that we do not expect to reproduce the incommensurate phase of arsenic , we can still use our system to approximate the pressure at which the system ceases to be sc , as well as to approximate the pressure at which it becomes bcc , and compare with the most recent experimental findings .",
    "thus , referring again to fig .",
    "[ fig : nnn_and_nn ] , we see that in the lda the sc  @xmath0  _ incomm . _ phase transition appears to occur at  gpa and the _ incomm . _  @xmath0  bcc at  gpa . in the gga - pbe",
    "it is  gpa and  gpa , and in the gga - pw91 it is  gpa and  gpa .",
    "although our findings for the sc  @xmath0  _ incomm .",
    "_ transition are about 10  gpa higher than those of ref .  , and fall into the high - end of the range of values given in ref .  , our results for the _ incomm .",

    "below are listed transition pressures for the higher pressure transitions of arsenic .",
    "parametrizations of the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange - correlation functional that appear below are pbe  @xcite and pw91.@xcite ( abbreviations : pp  pseudopotential approach , lapw  linear augmented plane wave approach . ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",

    "our main critique of the current literature is that we believe that any results published until now concerning this semi - metal to metal phase transition are unconverged ( as no thorough convergence studies have ever been published ) , and that any agreement with experiment has merely been fortuitous .",
    "this study has enabled us to present reliably converged results for the a7  @xmath0  sc transition of arsenic .",
