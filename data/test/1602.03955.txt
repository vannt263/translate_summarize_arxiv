    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are one of prominent objects in ir emission . @xmath0 m . ] in the milky way , among the three hundred known snrs , about 20%30%",
    "are usually seen in unbiased surveys using the the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) , _ spitzer space telescope _ , and   @xcite .",
    "this low fraction , however , is likely mainly because the snrs are located in the galactic plane where the confusion from foreground and background emission is severe . in nearby external galaxies such as the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ,",
    "the fraction is much higher , e.g. , @xmath1% @xcite .",
    "a primary mechanism for the ir emission in snrs is thermal dust emission .",
    "dust grains swept - up by sn blast waves are heated by collisions with hot x - ray emitting plasma and emit mid- and far - infrared emission .",
    "it has been pointed out that the resulting ir dust emission is the dominant cooling mechanism for snrs and could be more luminous than the x - ray emission in snrs over most of its lifetime even with dust destruction taken into account @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite examined the ratio of ir - to - x - ray ( irx ) fluxes of nine galactic and four magellanic snrs using  data , respectively , and they found that all the examined snrs have ratios greater than unity , so dust ir cooling is indeed more efficient than x - ray cooling in snrs .",
    "however , there was a large scatter in the observed ratios over three orders of magnitudes , with a majority of snrs having ratios significantly less than the theoretical flux ratio expected for hot gas in thermal equilibrium with the dust - to - gas ratio ( dgr ) of the general interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the snrs might have low irx flux ratios because of the destruction of dust grains by snr shocks or the low dgr in the ambient medium , while they could have high irx flux ratios because of the extra contribution from ir line emission and emission from dust heated by shock radiation . for large snrs such as the cygnus loop",
    ", it was shown that the ir emission can be decomposed into two components : one associated with x - rays , which might be from collisionally heated dust grains , and the other associated with optical filaments , which could be heated by both collision and radiation within the filament @xcite . however , with the  data , which have a resolution of several arcminutes , it was difficult to confirm the true nature of the ir emission for most snrs .",
    "practical use of the irx flux ratio for studying dust heating and processing has been regained with sensitive , high - resolution far - infrared ( fir ) data from recent high - resolution ir space missions .",
    "@xcite found that in sn 1987a , the irx flux ratio decreased significantly over three years and showed that the change is consistent with the destruction and heating of swept - up circumstellar dust behind the sn shock wave . @xcite and @xcite derived irx flux ratios for the snrs puppis a and rcw 86 , respectively , which were found to be considerably smaller than the theoretical irx flux ratio even with dust destruction taken into account , and they concluded that the dgr in the ambient medium of these snrs should be lower than that of the general ism by a factor of several .",
    "it is interesting that , in other studies of galactic and magellanic snrs , in which the dgr is obtained by directly comparing the dust mass derived from the ir sed ( spectral energy density ) modeling and the x - ray emitting mass derived from x - ray spectral analysis @xcite , a similar conclusion was reached .",
    "@xcite performed a systematic study of the snrs in the inner galaxy ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) using the  mipsgal survey ( survey of the inner galactic plane using mips ; @xcite ) in which they derived irx flux ratios of 13 snrs among the 39 snrs that they detected .",
    "the derived irx flux ratio ranged from 1.6 to 240 , which confirmed the earlier conclusion that the dust ir cooling is dominant over the x - ray cooling but the result was not discussed further .",
    "more recently , @xcite explored the ir and x - ray characteristics of the lmc snrs , and showed that the irx flux ratios of the lmc snrs are systematically lower than those of the galactic snrs to be consistent with the low dgr in the lmc .    in this paper",
    ", we use the ir and x - ray images from recent space missions , mainly from the  and the  x - ray telescope , to explore the nature of the ir emissions from snrs and the characteristics of their irx flux ratios .",
    "these arcsecond - resolution images make it possible to pursue the detailed investigation of the association between the ir and x - ray emissions .",
    "we limit our study to galactic snrs in this paper .",
    "the twenty galactic snrs studied in this paper are composed of eleven0.7 are not included because these remnants are not clearly visible in the fir band . ]",
    "snrs studied by @xcite and nine other snrs that are well - defined in fir band ( e.g. , from 20 @xmath0 m to @xmath5 @xmath0 m ) . in   2 ,",
    "we summarize ir and x - ray parameters of these snrs , introducing an index for the irx morphological correlation .",
    "it is found that the irx flux ratio has a systematic dependence on the irx morphology . in   3 ,",
    "we compare the observed irx flux ratios to the theoretical ratios expected for hot shocked plasma where dust grains are heated by collisions , and we show that time - dependent dust destruction and non - equilibrium ionization can explain the observed ratios of some snrs but not for most snrs .",
    "this result is discussed in   4 together with their irx morphological correlation .",
    "we will see that we can infer the natural and/or environmental characteristics of snrs from their irx flux ratios without a prior knowledge on them , which will be very useful to study snrs in external galaxies where we do not have the luxury of observing their morphology .",
    "the parameters characterizing global properties of the ir emission from snrs are the ir flux ( @xmath6 ) and color temperature of dust emission ( @xmath7 , hereafter ` dust temperature ' ) .",
    "we have derived these parameters for 13 snrs in this work , including 11 snrs studied by @xcite and two large snrs ic 443 and puppis a. for the rest , we adopted the parameters obtained in previous studies .",
    "eleven snrs from @xcite are all covered by the mipsgal survey @xcite and the  infrared galactic plane survey ( hi - gal ; molinari et al .",
    "the former survey is a legacy program of the _ spitzer space telescope _ covering the inner galactic plane ( @xmath863@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11 ) in two wavebands ( 24 and 70 @xmath0 m ) using mips , while the latter survey is an open time key project of the _ herschel space observatory _ covering a similar galactic longitude range , i.e. , @xmath860@xmath9 and @xmath12@xmath11 , in five wavebands between 70 and 500 @xmath0 m using the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) and the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) .",
    "the latitude coverage is @xmath4 except for @xmath13 where the coverage in the mipsgal survey is @xmath14 .",
    "we used the fully calibrated mips 24 @xmath0 m images ( version 3.0 ) and pacs 70 @xmath0 m images ( level 2.5 ) , which are available from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive and from the _ herschel _ science archive , respectively .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 m and pacs 70 @xmath0 m images have comparable spatial resolutions , i.e. , @xmath15 and 5.@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite derived total ir fluxes of their sources using  24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes , but we have not used 70 @xmath0 m images because they have considerably lower angular resolution ( @xmath17 ) than the  70 @xmath0 m images and are often contaminated by artifacts .",
    "the measured 24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes of the snrs are listed in table 1 . for most snrs , we simply measured the background - subtracted total flux density inside a circular area surrounding the entire snr with the background level estimated from an annulus just outside the circle .",
    "for some snrs , however , the contamination from the foreground and/or background emission is dominant , particularly at 70 @xmath0 m , and an accurate total flux density could not be obtained from such simple analysis .",
    "if , for example , we can measure the total 24 @xmath0 m flux density but can measure the 70 @xmath0 m flux density of only a limited region , we scaled the measured 70 @xmath0 m flux density using the ( 70 @xmath0m)/(24 @xmath0 m ) flux ratios of that area to obtain total 70 @xmath0 m flux . for snrs that required a special remedy , we have added notes in table 1 .    two large snrs , ic 443 and puppis a , have been observed by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using the  mips in fast scan mode .",
    "we have downloaded the archive images from the  heritage archive and derived their 24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes as above .",
    "total ir fluxes and dust temperatures are derived by assuming a single - temperature dust component with a power - law opacity of index 2 , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) is the mass absorption coefficient , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are reference wavelengths of the 24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the planck functions at the temperature of @xmath7 at wavelengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the reference wavelengths for the  24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes are 23.68 and 71.42 @xmath0 m , respectively , while it is 70.0 @xmath0 m for the   70 @xmath0 m flux . note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the above equations are the _ color - corrected _ fluxes , which differ from the observed fluxes usually by no more than a few percent .",
    "the derived @xmath7 and @xmath28 values are listed in table 1 . for the snrs",
    "whose parameters are adopted from previous studies , the references are given in the last column of the table .",
    "the fluxes in table 1 should be close to the total ir fluxes of snrs except for rcw 86 , for which the value is the flux of a small portion of the snr ( see note in table 1 ) .",
    "there is one caveat . at 24 and 70 @xmath0 m bands ,",
    "there are ionic lines which can make a significant contribution to the observed fluxes , e.g. , [ fe ii ] 24.5 @xmath0 m , [ fe ii]/[o iv ] 26.0 @xmath0 m , [ s i ] 25.2 @xmath0 m , and [ o i ] 63 @xmath0 m lines .",
    "this can happen for snrs where the shock is radiative . for kes 17 , for example ,",
    "the estimated line contributions are @xmath29% and @xmath30% to the mips 24 and  65 @xmath0 m fluxes , respectively @xcite .",
    "if we derive the ir parameters of this remnant using the continuum fluxes only , @xmath6 will be @xmath31% lower , and @xmath7 will be 1.5 k lower than those in table 1 .",
    "@xcite obtained  mips spectra of 14 galactic snrs with radiative shocks in dense environment , and kes 17 has the highest line contribution to the total ir flux .",
    "therefore , we consider that @xmath6 and @xmath7 in table 1 could be overestimated for some snrs because of fir ionic lines but the difference is probably not signicant to affect our analysis in this paper .",
    "essential x - ray parameters that we need in this study are the temperature of the x - ray emitting plasma ( @xmath32 ) and soft - x - ray ( 0.32.1 kev ) flux ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "another useful parameter is the ionization timescale @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for a constant electron density @xmath36 ) , which is the ` time ' for the plasma to have reached the current ionization state .",
    "both the dust and gas cooling rates , and therefore the ratio of irx fluxes , are time - dependent , and  can be used as a time parameter ( see the next section ) .",
    "x - ray parameters of the 20 snrs are given in table 2 .",
    "for snrs whose parameters had been derived from detailed modeling in previous studies , we adopted those parameters .",
    "the flux values in the literature are sometimes given in a different energy range than the range of 0.3 @xmath37 2.1 kev adopted in this work .",
    "for such cases , we converted the flux value in the literature to the flux of 0.3 @xmath37 2.1 kev by applying a correction factor based on the model and the model fit parameters in the literature .",
    "there are remnants where no suitable flux value was available . for these remnants , we extracted spectra of an entire remnant and conducted a spectral fitting adopting the hydrogen column density of the x - ray absorbing gas ( @xmath38 ) from the literature .",
    "we note that the unabsorbed flux is insensitive to detailed fit parameters except for the @xmath38 value . for three remnants ( g11.2@xmath370.3 , kes 73 and rcw 103 ) , we derived improved fit parameters by conducting a full spectral analysis . for each remnant ,",
    "the spectra from smaller regions are extracted and are fit with a single non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model .",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath32 and   in table 2 represent ensembles of these values . to derive the flux ,",
    "the spectrum of the entire region is extracted and fitted with @xmath38 fixed at the value from the previous step .",
    "figure 1 shows the ir and x - ray images of the snrs listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we see that some snrs such as kepler , g11.2@xmath370.3 , and puppis a have similar ir and x - ray morphology , whereas some snrs such as 3c391 , w49b , and ic 443 have either uncorrelated or anticorrelated ir and x - ray morphologies . to represent their formal resemblance in two wavebands , we use pearson s linear correlation coefficient between the ir and x - ray intensities as an index .",
    "the pearson s @xmath39 is defined as the covariance of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations , and it varies from + 1 ( perfect correlation ) to @xmath371 ( perfect anticorrelation ) .",
    "it can be obtained straightforwardly once we define the pixels for correlation , e.g. , using the idl procedure correlate .",
    "we use the bright pixels contributing 50% of total ir or total x - ray fluxes .",
    "that is , we first examine the cumulative brightness distribution of pixels in ir image of a source and determine the brightness level at which the cumulative flux becomes 50% of the total ir flux of the source ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the same can be done for the x - ray image to obtain @xmath41 .",
    "then the pixels for the correlation will be the ones with _ either _ its ir brightness greater than @xmath40 _ or",
    "_ its x - ray brightness greater than @xmath41 .",
    "the adopted percentage ( i.e. , 50% ) is somewhat arbitrary , but it yields correlation coefficients that reasonably characterize the morphological relation between the bright ir and x - ray emissions dominating the fluxes . before deriving the correlation coefficient ,",
    "we remove strong point sources in the ir and x - ray images and subtract a constant background .",
    "we also convolved the ir and x - ray images to the same resolution of 6@xmath4210@xmath42 for sources from /  images and 30@xmath42 for sources from  x - ray images and resampled them onto the same grid to have the same pixel scale of 1@xmath425@xmath42 per pixel depending on the image size .",
    "the computed correlation coefficients are listed in table 3 , while figure 2 shows the scattered diagrams of ir versus x - ray brightnesses used for the computation of   for puppis a and w49b which have the largest positive ( 0.76 ) and the largest negative ( @xmath43 ) , respectively .",
    "the snrs with relatively large ( @xmath44 ) positive  are kepler , g11.2@xmath370.3 , g15.9 + 0.2 , kes 73 , kes 75 , the cygnus loop , cas a , puppis a , msh 11@xmath3754 , rcw 86 and rcw 103 .",
    "all these snrs appear to have similar ir and x - ray morphologies in figure 1 .",
    "the snrs with relatively large ( @xmath45 ) negative  are 3c391 , w49b , w44 , and kes 17 .",
    "all these snrs appear to have anticorrelated ir and x - ray morphology in figure 1 .",
    "the snrs 3c396 , 3c397 , tycho , ic 443 , and g349.7 have  close to 0 ( i.e. , @xmath46 to 0.20 ) . these snrs seem to have both correlated and anticorrelated components ( see fig .",
    "we emphasize that the correlation coefficients in table 3 are based on the images in figure 1 which are mostly  24 @xmath0 m and  0.32.1 kev images ( see the caption of figure 1 ) .",
    "if there are more than one heating mechanism for dust , they could depend on wavelength .",
    "we note that the snrs with large negative  belong to the category of  thermal composite \" or  mixed - morphology \" snrs ( hereafter mm snrs ) that appear shell or composite type in radio but with thermal x - rays inside the snr @xcite , e.g. , 3c391 , w44 , and ic 443 .",
    "the ir morphologies of these snrs are very similar to their radio morphologies , which explains their large negative .",
    "the correlation coefficient  of the mm snrs , which gives , in a sense , the degree of mixed morphology , ranges from @xmath43 to @xmath47 excluding g292.0 + 1.8 which has an unusually large positive ( @xmath48 ) . most of these snrs are thought to be middle - aged snrs interacting with dense ism , e.g. , molecular clouds , and the origin of center - filling thermal x - rays is considered to be either dense clumps evaporating inside hot plasma or the result of large - scale conduction @xcite . however , not all snrs interacting with mcs are mm snrs and vice versa , so their nature is still unclear .",
    "for example , g292.0 + 1.8 is a young snr of mixed morphology because of thermal x - rays from sn ejecta and the swept - up circumstellar medium .",
    "( it also has a large positive . )",
    "we will discuss the nature of the snrs with large negative   further in   4 .",
    "in this section , we first obtain the irx flux ratios of snrs and investigate the relation to their irx morphology .",
    "we then compare the observed irx flux ratios to the theoretical ratios expected for hot shocked plasma where dust grains are heated by collisions .",
    "we note that the theoretical irx flux ratios of hot dusty plasma are not applicable for some snrs , e.g. , young snrs such as tycho where the x - ray emission is mostly from shocked sn ejecta while the fir emission is from shocked ambient medium or evolved snrs such as ic 443 where the fir emission is mostly from radiatively heated dust .",
    "we will see that the irx flux ratios of such snrs are significantly different from theoretical irx flux ratios , so that , even without a prior knowledge , one can infer the natural or / and environmental characteristics of an snr from its irx flux ratio .",
    "we define the observed irx flux ratio as @xmath49 and the  of 20 snrs obtained from @xmath50 and @xmath51 in tables 1 and 2 are given in table 3 .",
    "ranges from 0.32 to 204 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained @xmath52 to 990 and 1.6240 , respectively .",
    "for some snrs , our values differ from those of previous results by more than an order of magnitude , e.g. , ours : those of @xcite are 0.32:6.2 ( 3c397 ) , 15.5:1.6 ( rcw 103 ) , and 62.6:5.1 ( w49b ) .",
    "the difference from @xcite values originates mostly from the adopted x - ray fluxes .",
    "@xcite used the x - ray fluxes in the  snr catalog ] , some of which need to be updated .",
    "the difference from the values of @xcite , however , is partly due to different definitions of irx flux ratios .",
    "@xcite used x - ray fluxes corrected for nei effects and , for young snrs such as tycho and cas a , they used x - ray fluxes from the swept - up ambient medium while we simply used total fluxes . these factors , which need to be considered in interpreting the irx flux ratios , are discussed in the following sections .",
    "figure 3 plots  versus .",
    "we note that the  values of the snrs with negative @xmath53 are generally larger than those of the snrs with positive @xmath53 , or , alternatively , the snrs with high ( @xmath54 )  values have @xmath55 .",
    "this suggests that the large scatter could at least be partly explained by the ir emission from these snrs being of different origin , e.g. , the snrs of large negative @xmath53 and high  values are mm snrs ( marked by squares in the figure ) where the ir emission is probably from radiatively - heated dust _ not _ from collisionally - heated dust in x - ray emitting plasma ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "previous studies showed that the  values of snrs are @xmath56 , from which they concluded that dust ir cooling dominates over the x - ray cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all except two in our sample have @xmath57 which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies .",
    "we have two snrs , i.e. , 3c397 ( 0.32 ) and tycho ( 0.74 ) , that have @xmath58 , but they might have additional x - ray emission ( see   4.1 ) .      in figure 4-(a ) , we plot   versus the temperature of hot gas @xmath32 for 20 snrs .",
    "the figure is similar to figure 1 of @xcite , but there are now 20 snrs ( compared to their 9 ) and their locations in the diagram have been largely shifted .",
    "we first note that there is a large scatter in the observed irx flux ratio : snrs of the same x - ray temperature ( @xmath59  k ) have  values that differ by more than two orders of magnitude . the dotted line in figure 4-(a ) represents the expected irx ratios for hot , dusty plasma _ in thermal and collisional equilibrium _",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "if the plasma is in thermal equilibrium , its cooling rate by dust emission is equal to the heating rate of dust by collisions with electrons , so that the dust cooling function @xmath60 ( erg @xmath61 s@xmath62 ) becomes independent of @xmath36 and @xmath63 but depends on gas temperature @xmath32 and dust composition and size .",
    "if the plasma is in collisional equilibrium ( cie ) , the x - ray ( 0.32.1 kev ) gas cooling function @xmath64 is also a function of @xmath32 only .",
    "we have calculated the theoretical irx ratio @xmath65 , and the dotted line is for the ism dust model of @xcite , who assumed that 70% of c atoms are locked in graphite grains and all si atoms are locked in silicate ( mgfesio@xmath66 ) grains . for the grain size distribution , we adopted the mrn size distribution @xcite , with minimum and maximum grain radii of @xmath67 m and @xmath68 m , respectively . for @xmath64 ,",
    "we have used the chianti code ( v7.1.4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assuming the solar abundance of @xcite .",
    "we note that , by assuming solar abundance for the hot gas , we repeatedly include heavy elements in gas and dust cooling rates .",
    "however , if  is to be compared to the ratio of ir and x - ray fluxes obtained from the entire snr , this is not an entirely unacceptable assumption .",
    "furthermore , the physical condition for the shocked gas is expected to be very different from this equilibrium condition anyway ( see below ) .",
    "figure 4-(a ) shows that all snrs except w44 are below the dotted line .    the equilibrium curve in figure 4-(a ) , however , is not applicable to the irx flux ratio of snrs for at least two reasons : first , dust grains are destroyed behind the shock front and therefore the dgr decreases with time .",
    "second , it takes time for the swept - up ions to reach cie , so the x - ray cooling rate at the beginning could be much lower or higher than that in the cie model .",
    "we have developed a simple plane - shock model to calculate time - dependent  curve .",
    "( similar models can be found in previous works , e.g. , see @xcite . )",
    "we assume that dust grains with characteristics of the above equilibrium model are continuously injected into shocked gas . after being injected ,",
    "they are destroyed by thermal and non - thermal sputtering with ions and the grain size distribution is modified .",
    "( we neglect grain - grain shattering which is important for slow radiative shocks . ) the erosion rates ( @xmath69 ) by sputtering depends on the chemical composition and temperature of the shocked gas as well as the speed of grains through the plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 for graphite and silicate grains , respectively .",
    "these constant erosion rates are good within about 50% for the temperature range of our sample snrs , i.e. , between @xmath73  k and @xmath74  k ( table 2 ) .",
    "the gas density and temperature behind the shock front are assumed to remain the same .",
    "we calculated the cooling function of a fluid element and obtained a volume - averaged cooling rate by integrating it . for the x - ray cooling , it is necessary to incorporate the increase of the heavy element abundance of shocked gas with time owing to dust destruction and the different  that they experience , but we have found that the flux obtained by assuming a single  gives a satisfactory result .",
    "figures 5-(a ) and ( b ) show the resulting dust and x - ray cooling functions , respectively .",
    "the dust cooling function starts to deviate from the non - destruction case at @xmath75  @xmath76 s , while the x - ray cooling function is much lower or higher than the cie curve initially but approaches to it at @xmath77  @xmath76 s. the resulting time - dependent  curves are shown as solid lines in figure 4-(b ) .",
    "fluctuates about the equilibrium ratio initially , but it steadily decreases as a result of dust destruction . as  increases from @xmath78 to @xmath79  @xmath76 s ,  decreases in general at @xmath80  k. therefore , the scatter of the observed irx flux ratio in figure 4-(b ) appears to be attributable to an evolutionary effect .",
    "the  values of snrs derived from the x - ray spectral analysis , however , are mostly @xmath81  @xmath76 s except for the mm snrs ( table 2 ) whereas , if we exclude the snrs with high negative , most snrs excluding the young snrs appear to lie between the two curves of @xmath82 and @xmath79 @xmath76 s in figure 4-(b ) .",
    "this inconsistency can be also seen in figure 6 where we plot  versus  of snrs . if we exclude the snrs with high negative , which are well above the theoretical curves , the snrs are all below the theoretical curve and there appears to be no obvious correlation between  and .",
    "hence , the scatter in figure 4 may be partly due to an evolutionary effect , but not entirely .",
    "we have derived  values for the individual snrs from their  and @xmath32 in table 2 , and the results are listed in table 3 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows that the snrs with negative   have @xmath83 , whereas most other snrs have @xmath84 . in conclusion , only for a small number of snrs are the  values consistent with that of hot plasma where dust grains are collisionally heated .",
    "in this section , we first consider possible physical explanations for the snrs with  lower or higher than   ( hereafter refered to as snrs with low and high irx flux ratios ) .",
    "we then discuss the implication on recent results from the lmc snrs .      among the snrs with low  values ,",
    "the most prominent are kepler , cas a , tycho , and 3c397 .",
    "these remnants deviate from the  curve by an order of magnitude in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the first three are young historical snrs , and their small  values might be due to additional x - ray emission . in cas a and tycho , the x - ray emission is dominated by the x - ray emission from sn ejecta and not by thermal emission from shocked surrounding gas @xcite . in kepler , the x - ray emission from the circumstellar medium is not negligible @xcite .",
    "we estimate that @xmath85% of the x - ray flux is from sn ejecta from its soft band ( 0.30.7kev ) image .",
    "it is interesting that these snrs do have high positive  because the ir and x - ray emissions originate from spatially distinct regions unless the snr contains a large amount of newly - formed sn dust such as cas a. however , such positional shifts between the ir and x - ray sources are small and not apparent in their .",
    "the nature of another prominent snr 3c397 is uncertain .",
    "it had been proposed to be a middle - aged ( @xmath86 yr ) mm snr evolving in a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "co observation revealed a large molecular cloud along the sight line toward 3c397 @xcite , although there is no direct evidence ( e.g. , h@xmath87 emission ) for the interaction .",
    "however , its hard x - ray emission is dominated by sn ejecta , and it has been proposed that 3c397 is a young type ia snr evolving in a medium of low ( @xmath88  @xmath76 ) density @xcite .",
    "the location of 3c397 in figure 7 is very different from those of the other evolved mm snrs that have high irx flux ratios , and our result seems to support the latter interpretation , i.e. , a young type ia snr where the x - ray emission inside the snr is largely from sn ejecta .",
    "however , the x - ray absorbing column is large ( @xmath89  @xmath90 ) and there is a nearby hii region northwest of the remnant ( 3c397w ; * ? ? ? * ) which is bright in infrared ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , so this conclusion needs to be confirmed by further studies .",
    "there are two other mm snrs with small  values : g292.0 + 1.8 and 3c396 .",
    "g292.0 + 1.8 has significant x - ray emission from sn ejecta @xcite , which explains its small  value .",
    "note that it has ( @xmath91 ) very different from other mm snrs . for 3c396",
    ", we have not found a plausible explanation .",
    "its x - ray emission is partly non - thermal , but its contribution to the soft x - ray flux appears to be negligible @xcite .",
    "the other snrs with considerably small  values are g15.9 + 0.2 , kes 75 , puppius a , and rcw 86 .",
    "these snrs have large  and thus the fir emission is thought to be mainly from collisionally - heated dust .",
    "their  values , however , are smaller than those of  by a factor of 25 .",
    "( note that we have excluded the x - ray emission from the central pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula in kes 75 . )",
    "a possible explanation for this difference is that the dgr values in the surrounding media of these snrs are lower than that of the general ism @xcite .",
    "indeed , a similar conclusion has been reached for other galactic and magellanic snrs in previous studies @xcite . among the snrs with large , g11.2@xmath370.3 , kes 73 , the cygnus loop , and rcw 103 have  consistent with , which appears to indicate that the dgr in the ambient or circumstellar medium of these snrs might be equal to that of the general ism .",
    "it is , however , noteworthy that there could be some extra contribution to the ir emission , e.g. , ir line and/or radiatively heated dust emission ( see the next section ) . in the cygnus loop , for example , @xcite estimated that about 25% of the iras 60 @xmath0 m emission is from the dust in recombined gas in the postshock layer . from their analysis of a non - radiative shock in the cygnus loop ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the dgr in the ambient medium is about half that of the general ism .",
    "therefore , it is not impossible that these snrs do also have dgr values somewhat below that of the general ism .",
    "all the snrs with  values significantly larger than those of  are mm snrs with large negative , e.g. , w44 , w49b , 3c391 , ic 443 , kes 17 , and g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "the  values of some of these snrs are greater than those of   by almost by an order of magnitude .",
    "the fir emission in these snrs is not correlated with x - rays , and therefore is probably not from collisionally heated dust grains",
    ". there could be some contribution from ionic lines to the observed ir flux , but , as we discussed in   2.1 ,",
    "it is considered to be less than a few tens of percent .",
    "another distinct property of these snrs indicating a different origin of the fir emission is their low dust temperatures ( figure 8 ; see also table 1 ) .",
    "these snrs have @xmath9251 k whereas most other snrs have @xmath9367 k except for the young snrs kepler and cas a. for collisionally heated dust in hot ( @xmath94  k ) plasma , dust temperature is mainly determined by electron density ( @xmath36 ) , and , for a typical electron density of @xmath95 @xmath76 and silicate grains of radius 0.010.1 @xmath0 m , @xmath9650 k @xcite . therefore",
    ", dust temperatures of 5767 k are consistent with the fir emission being largely from collisionally - heated dust grains of radius @xmath97  @xmath0 m , but 4351 k might be rather low . in figure 8 , there appears to be a weak correlation ( correlation coefficient @xmath98 ) between @xmath99 and @xmath7 , and if we naively perform a least - squares fitting excluding the snrs with low  values in figure 7 , we obtain @xmath100 where the dust temperature ( @xmath7 ) is in k. if dust grains are heated by collisions in hot plasma , then we do not expect such a correlation because @xmath7 is mainly determined by @xmath36 whereas the irx flux ratio is independent of @xmath36 . instead , the apparent correlation in figure 8 might represent different origins for the dust ir emissions at low and ` high ' temperatures .",
    "the low dust temperature and large  values of the mm snrs with large negative  in figure 8 probably indicate that the fir emission in these snrs is largely from dust heated by shock radiation .",
    "all these snrs , e.g. , w44 @xcite , w49b @xcite , ic 443 @xcite , kes 17 @xcite , and g349.7 + 0.2 @xcite , are indeed known to be interacting with dense ambient medium and the shock is largely radiative . in a radiative shock ,",
    "essentially all the shock energy is converted into uv and x - ray radiation .",
    "this uv and x - ray radiation from the hot shocked gas ionizes and heats the surrounding gas to produce an extended temperature plateau region in the postshock cooling layer and also a ` radiative precursor ' in the preshock gas , both of which are at @xmath101  k ( see , for example , @xcite for the structure of radiative shock ) . since at shock speeds",
    "@xmath102  , dust grains are mostly not destroyed although their size distribution may be modified by grain - grain shattering @xcite , we expect dust grains in these hot and warm regions that will be mainly heated by attenuated x - ray and uv radiation and also by the recombination radiation from the ionized gas in those regions @xcite .",
    "if there are enough gas and dust columns beyond these hot and warm regions , the dust ir emission could be further absorbed by cold dust and re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we expect that , in these snrs , a significant fraction of the shock energy might be converted into ir radiation of a broad spectral energy distribution at color temperature considerably lower than that of the collisionally heated dust",
    ". it would be interesting to determine what fraction of shock energy is converted into the ir emission in these snrs .",
    "we define the characteristic efficiency of converting shock energy into ir radiation ( @xmath103 ) for an snr by the following equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the ir luminosity , @xmath106 is the hydrogen nuclei number density of the ambient medium , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the shock speed and radius of the snr , and @xmath109 g is the mean mass per hydrogen nucleus for a gas of cosmic abundance . in the second equation , we normalized the parameters by their typical values , i.e. , @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 ) , and @xmath112 ) .",
    "note that @xmath113 is the incoming energy flux , so @xmath103 would be the ratio of ir luminosity to the energy incoming rate for a spherically symmetric snr of radius @xmath108 in a uniform medium with a density of @xmath106 .",
    "of course real snrs are not spherically symmetric , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 usually vary over the remnant . for radiative portion of the snrs , we expect @xmath114  @xmath76 and @xmath115  , so the cooling time , @xmath116  yr @xcite , becomes shorter than the age of the snr .",
    "we may obtain a constraint on @xmath106 and @xmath107 from x - ray observation by assuming that there is a pressure equilibrium between the shock pressure and the thermal pressure of the x - ray emitting gas , i.e. , @xmath117 where @xmath36 and @xmath32 are the electron density and temperature of hot gas , respectively .",
    "( we assume fully ionized gas with @xmath118 . )",
    "the shock speed then is given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the volume filling factor of the x - ray emitting gas and @xmath121 .",
    "note that we used @xmath122 ( instead of @xmath36 ) because it is the parameter obtained from x - ray observation , e.g. , x - ray flux is proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "if we substitute this shock speed into equation ( 5 ) , the ir luminosity is given by @xmath124 in the above equation , @xmath105 is from the ir observation ( table 1 ) and @xmath122 and @xmath125 are from the x - ray observation ( table 2 ) , so that if we know @xmath120 and @xmath106 we can determine @xmath103 ( assuming that we know the distance to the snr and therefore @xmath108 ) .",
    "table 4 summarizes the physical parameters of six snrs with high irx ratios and their @xmath103 .",
    "we fixed @xmath126 because the volume filling factors are uncertain , although it has been estimated for some snrs , e.g. , 0.36 ( w49b ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath127 ( ic 443 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ambient density is also uncertain .",
    "@xcite showed that some of these snrs , i.e. , w44 , ic 443 , and 3c391 , are well described by an snr model expanding within a molecular cloud with an interclump density of 525 @xmath76 , while @xcite derived a somewhat lower density ( @xmath128  @xmath76 ) for w44 from  21  cm line observations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we adopted 315  @xmath76 for @xmath106 ( see note in table 4 ) .",
    "it is not unusual to observe both atomic and molecular shocks in these snrs , so the @xmath106 values in table 4 should be considered as reference values .",
    "note that we can scale the result using @xmath129 ( equation 7 ) .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in @xmath103 for a particular snr , our result shows that @xmath130% in general .",
    "we can imagine that this ` global ' efficiency @xmath103 will be proportional to the fraction of surface area encountering dense ambient medium and thus the local efficiency of converting shock energy into ir radiation could be higher . for comparison ,",
    "the fraction of shock energy that goes into the collisional - heating of dust is 1%10% for shocks with speeds of 100200  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as we expect from their large irx flux ratios , the ir luminosities of these snrs are significantly greater than those from collisionally - heated dust .",
    "recently @xcite conducted a systematic study of the lmc snrs using  and _ chandra _ data , and showed that the irx flux ratios of the lmc snrs are systematically lower than those of the galactic snrs , which is consistent with the low dgr and the low metallicity of the lmc , i.e. , the dust cooling rate is proportional to the dgr which is one - fourth of the galactic value while the gas cooling rate is proportional to metallicity which is one - half of the galactic value .",
    "they further classified the snrs into three groups , i.e. , snrs with definite , partial , and lack of irx correlation , and found that the irx flux ratios of the snrs with a partial or lack of irx morphological correlation are systematically higher than the ones with definite correlation .    in figure 9",
    ", we plot the  values of the lmc snrs against their dust temperatures .",
    "the irx flux ratios are from @xcite while dust temperatures are derived here from the 24 and 70 @xmath0 m fluxes in @xcite .",
    "we can see that the snrs with a lack of irx morphological correlation not only have large  values but also have low temperatures as we have found for the galactic snrs .",
    "their temperature ranges from 45 to 56  k , the maximum of which is a little higher than the 51 k of the galactic snrs .",
    "however , the dust temperature of the snrs with definite irx morphological correlation extends over a broad range from 48 to 80 k ( excluding 1987a , for which @xmath7 is 166 k ) .",
    "there is one snr ( 0453@xmath3768.5 ) with a definite correlation that has an exceptionally low ( @xmath131 k ) dust temperature .",
    "@xcite derived a comparable dust temperature ( 4055 k ) for the northern shell of this snr .",
    "its low @xmath7 could be due to low electron density combined with low electron temperature , e.g. , @xmath132 @xmath76 and @xmath133 kev @xcite .",
    "figure 9 also shows that about two - thirds of the lmc snrs are below the dashed line , which confirms the conclusion of @xcite that the irx flux ratio of the lmc snrs are systematically lower than those of the galactic snrs .",
    "( note that @xcite used the x - ray flux from the chandra snr catalog , so that their irx flux ratios are different from ours . ) in figure 9 , however , the snrs at low and high dust temperatures are not necessarily below the dashed line .",
    "this may be because , as we have found in the galactic snrs , the ir emission of the snrs at low temperatures is dominated by radiatively - heated dust grains while the x - ray emission of the snrs at high temperatures is dominated by sn ejecta , so that the low dgr and the low metallicity do not explicitly appear in the irx flux ratio .",
    "indeed the snrs with high dust temperatures , i.e. , n132d , n103b , 0519@xmath3769.0 , and 0509@xmath3767.5 , are all the youngest ( @xmath134  yr ) snrs in the lmc . in conclusion , the location of snrs in the ( , @xmath7 ) diagram reflects the snr environment as well as their natural properties .",
    "fir dust emission is a dominant emission for snrs , and it has been pointed out that fir cooling by collisionally - heated dust could be more important than the x - ray cooling by hot gas in snrs over most of their lifetimes . with the development of ir astronomy ,",
    "this was confirmed by comparing the ir to x - ray fluxes .",
    "the observed irx flux ratios however , scatter over three orders of magnitudes , and with the  data of several arcminute resolution , it was difficult to explore the true nature of the ir emission for most snrs . in this paper",
    ", we conducted a systematic study of the ir and x - ray properties of 20 snrs using the data from recent space missions to reveal details of morphology .",
    "we first showed that snrs have diverse relative ir and x - ray morphologies , from very similar to very different , and that their resemblance may be represented by the correlation parameter  (   2.3 ) .",
    "we then have derived irx flux ratios ( ) of the snrs and found that there is a systematic dependence on . by comparing  to the expected irx flux ratios ( ) for hot plasma where dust grains are collisionally heated , we explored how",
    "the irx flux ratios and irx morphology are related to the snr environment and their natural properties .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :      \\2 .",
    "the  values of all snrs except a few are all below the expected ratio for hot , dusty plasma of constant dgr in collisional ionization equilibrium . this can be attributed to dust destruction and nei gas cooling behind the shock front in some snrs , but for most snrs  values are either considerably larger or smaller than those of .",
    "\\3 . among the snrs with  values",
    "significantly less than those of , the most prominent are young snrs such as cas a , kepler , and tycho . in these snrs ,",
    "the x - ray emission is dominated by metal - rich sn ejecta and our  values are not applicable .",
    "we consider that this might be also the case for other young snrs with anticorrelated irx morphology in this category .",
    "there are , however , also snrs without apparent x - ray emission from sn ejecta .",
    "they exhibit good irx morphological correlation . for these snrs",
    ", a low dgr of the ambient medium seems to be a plausible explanation .",
    "all snrs with  values significantly greater than  ones have large negative , i.e. , are with anticorrelated irx morphology .",
    "the dust temperature of these snrs is systematically lower than those of the other snrs .",
    "these snrs are known to be interacting with a dense environment , and the ir emission in these snrs is probably from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions .",
    "the global conversion efficiency of shock energy to ir emission is estimated to be more than a few tens of percent .",
    "our results show that the irx flux ratios together with dust temperature are useful indicators for the snr environment as well as their natural properties .",
    "we may infer that the snrs with small  and high @xmath7 values are young snrs with x - ray emission dominated by sn ejecta , whereas the snrs with large  and low @xmath7 are evolved snrs interacting with a dense environment .",
    "this was confirmed for the snrs in the lmc .",
