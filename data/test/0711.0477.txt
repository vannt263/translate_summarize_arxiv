    "this paper is based on three lectures i gave at the conference on `` renormalization and galois theories '' that was held in luminy , at the centre international de rencontres mathmatiques ( cirm ) , on march 2006 .",
    "the purpose of these talks was to give an elementary overview on classical motives ( pure motives ) and to survey on some of the recent developments of this theory in noncommutative geometry , especially following the introduction of the notion of an _",
    "endomotive_.    it is likely to expect that the reader acquainted with the literature on motives theory will not fail to notice the allusion , in this title , to the paper @xcite in which p. deligne states that in spite of the lack of essential progresses on the problem of constructing `` relevant '' algebraic cycles , the techniques supplied by the theory of motives remain a powerful tool in algebraic geometry and arithmetic .",
    "the assertion on the lack of relevant progresses on algebraic cycles seems , unfortunately , still to apply at the present time , fifteen years after deligne wrote his paper . despite the general failure of testing the standard conjectures , it is also true that in these recent years the knowledge on motives has been substantially improved by several new results and also by some unexpected developments .",
    "motives were introduced by a. grothendieck with the aim to supply an intrinsic explanation for the analogies occurring among various cohomological theories in algebraic geometry .",
    "they are expected to play the role of a universal cohomological theory by also furnishing a linearization of the theory of algebraic varieties and in the original understanding they were expected to provide the correct framework for a successful approach to the weil s conjectures on the zeta - function of a variety over a finite field .    even though the weil s conjectures have been proved by deligne without appealing to the theory of motives , an enlarged and in part still conjectural theory of mixed motives",
    "has in the meanwhile proved its usefulness in explaining conceptually , some intriguing phenomena arising in several areas of pure mathematics , such as hodge theory , @xmath0-theory , algebraic cycles , polylogarithms , @xmath1-functions , galois representations etc .    very recently ,",
    "some new developments of the theory of motives to number - theory and quantum field theory have been found or are about to be developed , with the support of techniques supplied by noncommutative geometry and the theory of operator algebras .    in number - theory ,",
    "a conceptual understanding of the main result of @xcite on the interpretation proposed by a. connes of the weil explicit formulae as a lefschetz trace formula over the noncommutative space of adle classes , requires the introduction of a generalized category of motives inclusive of spaces which are highly singular from a classical viewpoint .",
    "the problem of finding a suitable enlargement of the category of ( smooth projective ) algebraic varieties is combined with the even more compelling one of the definition of a generalized notion of correspondences .",
    "several questions arise already when one considers special types of zero - dimensional noncommutative spaces , such as the space underlying the quantum statistical dynamical system defined by j. b. bost and connes in @xcite ( the bc - system ) .",
    "this space is a simplified version of the adles class space of @xcite and it encodes in its group of symmetries , the arithmetic of the maximal abelian extension of @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "i give an overview on the theory of endomotives ( algebraic and analytic ) .",
    "this theory has been originally developed in the joint paper @xcite with a. connes and m. marcolli and has been applied already in our subsequent work @xcite .",
    "the category of endomotives is the minimal one that makes it possible to understand conceptually the role played by the absolute galois group in several dynamical systems that have been recently introduced in noncommutative geometry as generalizations of the bc - system , which was our motivating and prototype example .",
    "the category of endomotives is a natural enlargement of the category of artin motives : the objects are noncommutative spaces defined by semigroup actions on projective limits of artin motives .",
    "the morphisms generalize the notion of algebraic correspondences and are defined by means of tale groupoids to account for the presence of the semigroup actions .",
    "endomotives carry a natural galois action which is inherited from the artin motives and they have both an algebraic and an analytic description .",
    "the latter is particularly useful as it provides the data of a quantum statistical dynamical system , via the implementation of a _",
    "canonical time evolution _ ( a one - parameter family of automorphisms ) which is associated by the theory of m.  tomita ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) to an initial state ( probability measure ) assigned on an analytic endomotive .",
    "this is the crucial new development supplied by the theory of operator - algebras to a noncommutative @xmath3-algebra and in particular to the algebra of the bc - system .",
    "the implication in number - theory is striking : the time evolution implements on the dual system a scaling action which combines with the action of the galois group to determine on the cyclic homology of a suitable noncommutative motive associated to the original endomotive , a characteristic zero analog of the action of the weil group on the tale cohomology of an algebraic variety .",
    "when these techniques are applied to the endomotive of the bc - system or to the endomotive of the adles class space , the main implication is the spectral realization of the zeroes of the corresponding @xmath1-functions .",
    "these results supply a first answer to the question i raised in the title of this paper ( a quoi servent les endomotifs ? ) .",
    "an open and interesting problem is connected to the definition of a higher dimensional theory of noncommutative motives and in particular the introduction of a theory of noncommutative elliptic motives and modular forms .",
    "a related problem is of course connected to the definition of a higher dimensional theory of geometric correspondences .",
    "the comparison between algebraic correspondences for motives and geometric correspondences for noncommutative spaces is particularly easy in the zero - dimensional case , because the equivalence relations play no role .",
    "in noncommutative geometry , algebraic cycles are naturally replaced by bi - modules , or by classes in equivariant @xmath4-theory .",
    "naturally , the original problem of finding `` interesting '' cycles pops - up again in this topological framework : a satisfactory solution to this question seems to be one of the main steps to undertake for a further development of these ideas .",
    "the theory of motives in algebraic geometry was established by a. grothendieck in the 1960s : 1963 - 69 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the foundations are documented in the unpublished manuscript @xcite and were discussed in a seminar at the institut des hautes tudes scientifiques , in 1967 .",
    "this theory was conceived as a fundamental machine to develop grothendieck s `` long - run program '' focused on the theme of the connections between geometry and arithmetic .    at the heart of the philosophy of motives",
    "sit grothendieck s speculations on the existence of a universal cohomological theory for algebraic varieties defined over a base field @xmath5 and taking values into an abelian , tensor category .",
    "the study of this problem originated as the consequence of a general dissatisfaction connected to an extensive use of topological methods in algebraic geometry , with the result of producing several but insufficiently related cohomological theories ( betti , de - rham , tale etc . ) .",
    "the typical example is furnished by a family of homomorphisms @xmath6 connecting the groups of tale cohomology of two ( smooth , projective ) varieties , as the prime number @xmath7 varies , which are not connected , in general , by any sort of ( canonical ) relation .",
    "the definition of a contravariant functor ( functor of motivic cohomology ) @xmath8 from the category @xmath9 of projective , smooth , irreducible algebraic varieties over @xmath5 to a semi - simple abelian category of pure motives @xmath10 is also tied up with the definition of a universal cohomological theory through which every other classical , cohomology @xmath11 ( here understood as contravariant functor ) should factor by means of the introduction of a fiber functor ( realization @xmath12-functor ) @xmath13 connecting @xmath10 to the abelian category of ( graded ) vector - spaces over @xmath2    v_k & ^h^ & grv ect _ + & _ h & ^ + & & m_k(v_k )    following grothendieck s original viewpoint , the functor @xmath14 should implement the sought for mechanism of compatibilities ( in tale cohomology ) and at the same time it should also describe a universal linearization of the theory of algebraic varieties .    the definition of the category @xmath10 arised from a classical construction in algebraic geometry which is based on the idea of extending the collection of algebraic morphisms in @xmath9 by including the ( algebraic ) _ correspondences_. a correspondence between two objects @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath9 is a multi - valued map which connects them . an algebraic correspondence is defined by means of an algebraic cycle in the cartesian product @xmath17 .",
    "the concept of ( algebraic ) correspondence in geometry is much older than that of a motive : it is in fact already present in several works of the italian school in algebraic geometry ( _ cf . _",
    "severi s theory of correspondences on algebraic curves ) .",
    "grothendieck s new intuition was that the whole philosophy of motives is regulated by the theory of ( algebraic ) correspondences :    `` _ ...",

    "motives were envisioned with the hope to explain the intrinsic relations between integrals of algebraic functions in one or more complex variables .",
    "their ultimate goal was to supply a machine that would guarantee a generalization of the main results of galois theory to systems of polynomials equations in several variables . here",
    ", we refer in particular to a higher - dimensional analog of the well - known result which describes the linearization of the galois - grothendieck correspondence for the category @xmath18 of tale , finite @xmath5-schemes @xmath19 by means of the equivalence between the category of artin motives and that of the representations of the absolute galois group .    in the following section we shall describe how the fundamental notions of the theory of motives arose from the study of several classical problems in geometry and arithmetic .",
    "a classical problem in algebraic geometry is that of computing the solutions of a finite set of polynomial equations @xmath20 with coefficients in a finite field @xmath21 .",
    "this study is naturally formalized by introducing the generating series @xmath22 which is associated to the algebraic variety @xmath23 that is defined as the set of the common zeroes of the polynomials @xmath24 .    under the assumption that @xmath15 is smooth and projective , the series encodes the complete information on the number of the rational points of the algebraic variety , through the coefficients @xmath25 .",
    "the integers @xmath26 supply the cardinality of the set of the rational points of @xmath15 , computed in successive finite field extensions @xmath27 of the base field @xmath21 .",
    "intersection theory furnishes a general way to determine the number @xmath26 as intersection number of two algebraic cycles on the cartesian product @xmath28 : namely the diagonal @xmath29 and the graph @xmath30 of the @xmath31-th iterated composite of the frobenius morphism on the scheme @xmath32 : @xmath33 the frobenius endomorphism is in fact an interesting example of _ correspondence _ , perhaps the most interesting one , for algebraic varieties defined over finite fields . as a correspondence it induces a commutative diagram @xmath34 in tale cohomology . through the commutativity of the above diagram one",
    "gets a way to express the action of the induced homomorphism in cohomology , by means of the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 denote the two projection maps . here , ` algebraic ' refers to the algebraic cycle @xmath37 that performs such a correspondence .    for particularly simple algebraic varieties , such as projective spaces @xmath38 , the computation of the integers @xmath26 can be done by applying an elementary combinatorial argument based on the set - theoretical description of the space @xmath39 ( @xmath40 any field ) .",
    "this has the effect to produce the interesting description @xmath41 this decomposition of the set of the rational points of a projective space was certainly a first source of inspiration in the process of formalizing the foundations of the theory of motives .",
    "in fact , one is naturally led to wonder on the casuality of the decomposition , possibly ascribing such a result to the presence of a cellular decomposition on the projective space which induces a related break - up on the set of the rational points .",
    "remarkably , a.  weil proved that a similar formula holds also in the more general case of a smooth , projective algebraic curve @xmath42 of genus @xmath43 . in this case one",
    "shows that @xmath44 these results suggest that and are the manifestation of a deep and intrinsic structure that governs the geometry of algebraic varieties .",
    "the development of the theory of motives has in fact shown to us that this structure reveals itself in several contexts : topologically , manifests its presence in the decomposition of the cohomology @xmath45 , whereas arithmetically it turns out that it is the same structure that controls the decomposition of the series as a rational function of @xmath46 : @xmath47 this is in fact a consequence of the description of the integers @xmath26 supplied by the lefschetz - grothendieck trace formula ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) @xmath48      originally , grothendieck proposed a general framework for a so called category of _ numerically effective motives _ @xmath49 over a field @xmath5 and with rational coefficients .",
    "this category is defined by enlarging the category @xmath9 of smooth , projective algebraic varieties over @xmath5 ( and algebraic morphisms ) by following the so - called procedure of pseudo - abelian envelope .",
    "this construction is performed in two steps : at first one enlarges the set of morphisms of @xmath9 by including ( rational ) algebraic correspondences of degree zero , modulo numerical equivalence , then one performs a pseudo - abelian envelope by formally including among the objects , kernels of idempotent morphisms .    let us assume for simplicity that the algebraic varieties are irreducible ( the general case is then deduced from this , by additivity ) . for any given @xmath50 , one works with correspondences @xmath51 which are elements of codimension equal to @xmath52 in the rational graded algebra @xmath53 of algebraic cycles modulo _",
    "numerical equivalence_. we recall that two algebraic cycles on an algebraic variety @xmath15 are said to be numerically equivalent @xmath54 , if @xmath55 for any algebraic cycle @xmath56 on @xmath15 . here , by @xmath57 we mean the degree of the algebraic cycle @xmath58 .",
    "the degree defines a homomorphism from the free abelian group of algebraic cycles @xmath59 to the integers . on the components @xmath60 , the map is defined as follows @xmath61 the symbol `",
    "@xmath62 ' in refers to the intersection product structure on @xmath63 , which is well - defined under the assumption of proper intersection .",
    "if @xmath64 is proper ( _ i.e. _  @xmath65 ) , then intersection theory supplies the definition of an intersection cycle @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the intersection product is commutative and associative whenever is defined .",
    "passing from the free abelian group @xmath63 to the quotient @xmath67 , modulo a suitable equivalence relation on cycles , allows one to use classical results of algebraic geometry ( so called moving lemmas ) which lead to the definition of a ring structure .",
    "one then defines intersection cycle classes in general , even when cycles do not intersect properly , by intersecting equivalent cycles which fulfill the required geometric property of proper intersection .",
    "it is natural to guess that the use of the numerical equivalence in the original definition of the category of motives was motivated by the study of classical constructions in enumerative geometry , such as for example the computation of the number of the rational points of an algebraic variety defined over a finite field .",
    "one of the main original goals was to show that for a suitable definition of an equivalence relation on algebraic cycles , the corresponding category of motives is _ semi - simple_. this means that the objects @xmath68 in the category decompose , following the rules of a _ theory of weights _",

    "section  [ fundstructures ] ) , into direct _ factors _ @xmath69 , with @xmath70 simple ( _ i.e. _",
    "indecomposable ) motives associated to smooth , projective algebraic varieties . the importance of achieving such a result is quite evident if one seeks , for example , to understand categorically the decomposition @xmath71 in cohomology , or if one wants to recognize the role of motives in the factorization of zeta - functions of algebraic varieties .",
    "grothendieck concentrated his efforts on the numerical equivalence relation which is the coarsest among the equivalence relations on algebraic cycles .",
    "so doing , he attacked the problem of the semi - simplicity of the category of motives from the easiest side .",
    "however , despite a promising departing point , the statement on the semi - simplicity escaped all his efforts .",
    "in fact , the result he was able to reach at that time was dependent on the assumption of the _ standard conjectures _ , two strong topological statements on algebraic cycles .",
    "the proof of the semi - simplicity of the category of motives for numerical equivalence ( the only equivalence relation producing this result ) was achieved only much later on in the development of the theory ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "the proof found by u. jannsen uses a fairly elementary but ingenious idea which mysteriously eluded grothendieck s intuition as well as all the mental grasps of several mathematicians after him .    by looking at the construction of ( pure ) motives in perspective",
    ", one immediately recognizes the predominant role played by the morphisms over the objects , in the category @xmath49 .",
    "this was certainly a great intuition of grothendieck .",
    "this idea led to a systematic study of the properties of algebraic cycles and their decomposition by means of _ algebraic projectors _",
    ", that is algebraic cycles classes @xmath72 satisfying the property @xmath73 notice that in order to make sense of the notion of a projector and more in general , in order to define a law of composition ` @xmath74 ' on algebraic correspondences , one needs to use the ring structure on the graded algebra @xmath75 .",
    "the operation ` @xmath74 ' is defined as follows .",
    "let us assume for simplicity , that the algebraic varieties are connected ( the general case can be easily deduced from this ) .",
    "then , two algebraic correspondences @xmath76 ( of degree @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 ( of degree @xmath79 ) compose accordingly to the following rule ( bi - linear , associative ) @xmath80 @xmath81 in the particular case of projectors @xmath82 , one is restricted , in order to make a sense of the condition @xmath83 , to use only particular types of algebraic correspondences : namely those of degree zero .",
    "these are the elements of the abelian group @xmath84 .",
    "the objects of the category @xmath49 are then pairs @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 a projector .",
    "this way , one attains the notion of a @xmath2-linear , pseudo - abelian , monoidal category ( the @xmath12-monoidal structure is deduced from the cartesian product of algebraic varieties ) , together with the definition of a contravariant functor @xmath88 here @xmath89 denotes the motive associated to @xmath15 and @xmath90 means the trivial ( _ i.e. _  identity ) projector associated to the diagonal @xmath29 .",
    "more in general , @xmath85 refers to the motive @xmath91 that is cut - off on @xmath92 by the ( range of the ) projector @xmath82 .",
    "notice that images of projectors are formally included among the objects of @xmath49 , by the procedure of the pseudo - abelian envelope .",
    "the cut - off performed by a projector @xmath87 on the space determines a corresponding operation in cohomology ( for any classical weil theory ) , by singling out the sub - vector space @xmath93 .",
    "the category @xmath49 has two important basic objects : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "this fact implies that the decomposition is canonical .",
    "more in general , it follows from the knneth decomposition of the diagonal @xmath105 in @xmath106 by algebraic cycles @xmath107 , ( _ cf . _  @xcite and @xcite for the details ) that the motive of a projective space @xmath108 decomposes into pieces ( simple motives ) @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "it is precisely this decomposition which implies the decomposition on the rational points , when @xmath112 !    for ( irreducible ) curves , and in the presence of a rational point @xmath113 , one obtains a similar decomposition ( non canonical ) @xmath114 with @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this decomposition is responsible for the formula .",
    "in fact , one can prove that these decompositions partially generalize to any object @xmath86 . in the presence of a rational point , or more in general by choosing a positive zero - cycle @xmath118 ( here @xmath15 is assumed irreducible for simplicity and @xmath119 ) , one constructs two rational algebraic cycles @xmath120 which determine two projectors @xmath121 in the chow group @xmath122 of rational algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence .",

    "_  _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .    for the applications , it is convenient to enlarge the category of effective motives by formally adding the tensor product inverse @xmath126 of the lefschetz motive : one usually refers to it as to the _ tate motive_. it corresponds , from the more refined point of view of galois theory , to the cyclotomic characters .",
    "this enlargement of @xmath49 by the so - called `` virtual motives '' produces an abelian , semi - simple category @xmath127 of pure motives for numerical equivalence .",
    "the objects of this category are now triples @xmath128 , with @xmath129 .",
    "effective motives are of course objects of this category and they are described by triples @xmath130 .",
    "the lefschetz motive gains a new interpretation in this category as @xmath131 .",
    "the tate motive is defined by @xmath132 and is therefore reminissent of ( in fact induces ) the notion of tate structure @xmath133 in hodge theory .    in the category @xmath127 , the set of morphisms connecting two motives @xmath128 and @xmath134",

    "the proof by deligne of the weil s conjectures , however , does not make any use of the standard conjectures , these latter questions remain still unanswered at the present time .",
    "the moral lesson seems to be that geometric topology and the theory of algebraic cycles govern in many central aspects the foundations of algebraic geometry .",
    "the standard conjectures of `` lefschetz type '' and of `` hodge type '' are stated in terms of algebraic cycles modulo homological equivalence ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "they imply two further important conjectures .",
    "one of these states the equality of the homological and the numerical equivalence relations , the other one , of `` knneth type '' claims that the knneth decomposition of the diagonal in cohomology , can be described by means of ( rational ) algebraic cycles .",
    "it is generally accepted , nowadays , to refer to the full set of the four conjectures , when one quotes the standard conjectures . in view of their expected consequences ,",
    "one is naturally led to study a category of pure _ motives for homological equivalence_. in fact , there are several candidates for this category since the definition depends upon the choice of a weil cohomological theory ( _ i.e. _  betti , tale , de - rham , crystalline , etc ) with coefficients in a field @xmath0 of characteristic zero .",
    "let us fix a cohomological theory @xmath147 for algebraic varieties in the category @xmath9 .",
    "then , the construction of the corresponding category of motives @xmath148 for homological equivalence is given following a procedure similar to that we have explained earlier on in this paper for the category of motives for numerical equivalence and with rational coefficients .",
    "the only difference is that now morphisms in the category @xmath149 are defined by means of algebraic correspondences modulo homological equivalence .",
