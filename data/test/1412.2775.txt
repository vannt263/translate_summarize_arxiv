    ", there appears to be a quantum critical transition as a function of doping which is characterized by sharp maxima in a variety of properties near absolute zero @xcite . remarkably , the superconducting phases of the hole- and electron - doped materials have the same @xmath7-wave pairing symmetry @xcite . however , there is uncertainty about the position of the critical doping and even the number of critical points .",
    "this results from the difficulty to monitor how the antiferromagnetic phase of the parent compound evolves and changes as a function of doping , especially on the electron - doped side @xcite .",
    "this issue remains of central importance since fluctuations associated with the quantum critical point ( qcp ) may be the origin of strong superconducting pairing and unusual properties in the normal state @xcite .",
    "although there are many similarities in the generic phase diagrams of hole and electron - doped cuprates , there are also considerable differences @xcite . in particular , the magnetism is much more prominent on the electron - doped side and appears to overlap significantly with superconductivity .",
    "also the superconducting dome is much smaller and narrower in electron - doped systems @xcite .",
    "both systems show a pseudo - gap opening below a temperature @xmath8 in the underdoped region which indicates some kind of fluctuating charge or spin order @xcite .",
    "however it is still unclear if the character of the pseudo - gap phase is the same in both the electron- and hole - doped cuprates @xcite .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "determining the phase diagram in electron - doped cuprates is complicated by the difficulty in determining how the magnetism evolves and eventually disappears as a function of doping .",
    "for example in ncco , inelastic magnetic neutron - scattering results show that the long - range antiferromagnetic order disappears close to where superconductivity first appears @xcite .",
    "however , both shubnikov - de haas oscillations @xcite and arpes measurements @xcite find a transition well inside the superconducting dome where the fermi surface reconstructs .",

    "one possibility is that neutrons detect the disappearance of the long range 3d antiferromagnetic order where superconductivity begins .",

    "a major difficulty in determining how the magnetism evolves in la@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3  is that it can only be made in a thin film form .",

    "it is more subtle but still clear that the signal is less damped at 5 kev compared to 21 kev in the @xmath13 sample ( red and blue points in fig .",

    "as one approaches the transition , the magnitude of this average field @xmath17 drops to zero . above the transition , in the paramagnetic state , the electronic moments are rapidly fluctuating , so the observed weak time dependence of the muon polarization is due mostly to weak quasi - static nuclear dipolar fields . in the @xmath13 sample at 20 kev ( not shown in fig .",

    "the surface has a magnetic ordering temperature close to @xmath31 k ( see green points in fig . [",

    "this is evident from the fast relaxing signal at low energies ( below 10 kev ) as seen earlier in figs .",
    "[ fig : espectra ] and [ fig : escan ] , compared to the slowly relaxing signal at higher energies . at the highest ce concentration ( @xmath25 ) there is no magnetic ordering at any temperature .",
    "it is important to note that the muon is sensitive to any static order both short and long range .",
    "the absence of any static magnetic field in a @xmath16sr experiment ( e.g. in the @xmath25 sample ) implies there is no static 3d magnetism of any type ( long range antiferromagnetism , spin density wave , or spin glass ) . on the other hand",

    "the brown band defines the magnetic phase boundary from the le-@xmath16sr  measurements , with static magnetism to the left .",

    "solid and dashed lines are guides to the eye .",
    "error bars of our measurements define the temperature range where magnetism disappears . ]",
    "there is a considerable difference in the magnetic phase boundary seen with zf-@xmath16sr and amr as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] . in particular le-@xmath16sr   shows a much narrower region of overlap of the static magnetism with superconductivity .",
    "comparing the results from these two techniques provides an important insight into the nature of the magnetism .",
    "angular magneto resistance ( amr ) and le-@xmath16sr   are sensitive to magnetic fluctuations on a much different time scale . as mentioned above le-@xmath16sr   measures the temperature where the internal fields become static on the scale of the period for the larmor frequency associated with the internal fields , which in this case is @xmath34 s. on the other hand the amr detects magnetism when the fluctuations become much slower than the relaxation time ( @xmath35 s ) .",
    "normally this would not shift the ordering temperature very much .",
    "however lcco is highly anisotropic so that the coupling between moments in the plane is considerably larger than the coupling between planes .",
    "thus the ordering temperature detected by amr is determined by the in - plane coupling between spins @xmath36 . just below this temperature the moments",
    "are highly correlated in the cuo@xmath0 plane but are still dynamic on the time scale detectable with le-@xmath16sr .",
    "the ordering temperature in le-@xmath16sr  defines the boundary for static 3d ordering , which depends and varies logarithmically with the much smaller magnetic coupling between planes @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this gives new insight into the relationship between the magnetism in the region of the sc dome before the fermi surface reconstructs .",
    "apparently the moments are still fully developed above @xmath4 but are very dynamic on the muon time scale .",
    "finally we note that the le-@xmath16sr  measurements are performed in zero applied magnetic field whereas the amr measurements are made in a magnetic field of 14 t applied in plane .",
    "it is possible that the large magnetic field used in amr would frustrate the 2d antiferromagnetic order and thereby suppress ordering temperature .",
    "this could explain why the amr 2d phase boundary seems to cross the le-@xmath16sr  3d phase boundary at @xmath13 .    from the le-@xmath16sr   results in the bulk of the film ,",
    "we conclude that the static 3d static magnetism disappears close to where superconductivity begins and thus there is little overlap region between static 3d magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "this is similar to what is found in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  except of the evidence of phase separation in bulk , such that a weak spin glass phase with a small volume fraction extends into the superconducting dome in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a similar spin glass phase exists in lcco in bulk but the glass temperature would have to be lower than our base temperature of 4 k. thus the present results are consistent with a sharp boundary and competition between the superconductivity and magnetism without microscopic coexistence .",
    "however comparing these results with amr leads us to the conclusion that above the sc dome the moments are fully developed and highly correlated within the cuo@xmath0 plane but are still fluctuating without any 3d order . striking similarities between hole and electron - doped cuprates",
    "are also reported by transport studies @xcite .",
    "it is now clear there are at least two quantum critical points in la@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "the lower one is near @xmath26 where the antiferromagnetic disappears , whereas , the fermi surface reconstructs at a much higher doping level above @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that recent studies of certain heavy fermions show a similar phase diagram with two critical points or possibly a line of quantum critical points called a quantum critical phase in between @xcite .",
    "the difference in the magnetic behaviour of the surface compared to the bulk of the film is also very interesting .",
    "it is possible that small structural changes , expected near a free surface , are enough to tip the balance towards magnetism .",
    "this would be consistent with a small difference in ( free ) energy between competing phases near a critical point . as mentioned previously le-@xmath16sr  measurements",
    "were also taken on a thinner ( 100 nm ) sample with @xmath26 .",
    "the magnetic properties of the free surface were the same as in the 200 nm thick film with the same value of @xmath19 .",
    "however in the thinner film it was possible , using 21 kev muons , to probe the interface between the film and the substrate .",
    "these measurements showed this interface was non - magnetic , implying the magnetism is not simply a consequence of the broken translational symmetry and resulting boundary conditions .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have conducted a depth - resolved le-@xmath16sr  study of magnetism in la@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3  films close to the magnetic - superconducting transition region .",
    "we find that the near surface region tends to be more magnetic than the bulk of the films .",
    "the enhanced magnetism in the near surface region of @xmath26 is a property of the free surface and absent near the substrate interface .",
    "the disappearance of strong static magnetic order in the bulk occurs just below @xmath26 , which is close to where superconductivity appears . above this critical value of @xmath19",
    "the moments may exist but are fluctuating rapidly on the muon time scale .",
    "the amr results there is a high degree of 2d order above the superconducting dome . thus above the superconducting transition",
    "the system is in a dynamic magnetic state with strong antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "this is similar to the hole - doped counterpart la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  and consistent with a competition between order parameters .",
    "these results suggest there may be a higher degree of particle - hole symmetry in this critical region of the phase diagram than previously thought .",
    "* le-@xmath16sr  experiment * : the measurements are performed using low - energy @xmath16srtechnique , where an intense high - energy beam of muons is moderated in a solid ar film . a small percentage of the incident muons emerge from the argon surface at low - energy ( @xmath3810 ev ) .",
    "these are subsequently accelerated to 15 kev and transported to the sample chamber and @xmath16sr spectrometer .",
    "the samples are mounted onto a ag coated metal plate which is electrically isolated from the cold finger of the cryostat and biased to a high voltage ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 kv .",
    "this allows the implantation energy of the muons to be adjusted between about @xmath41 and @xmath42 kev .",
    "the measurements reported here were performed in zero external magnetic field ( zf ) such that any stray magnetic field at the sample was less than 0.01 mt .",
    "measurements in a longitudinal field and transverse field were also performed but are not shown here .",
    "the time evolution of the muon spin polarization @xmath43 , which is measured through the properties of the muon decay , depends on the static and fluctuating components of the internal magnetic field at the site of the muon @xcite .",

    "the three films had ce concentrations of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath46 . since the oxygen content has an influence on both the superconducting and normal state properties of the material , the annealing process is optimized for each @xmath19 .",
