    "traditionally , people regarded that three - dimensional models are good toy models with which to study the basic nature of pure gravity and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "first , there may be a qualitative relation between a cosmic string in four dimensions and a point source in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "second , three - dimensional gravity is simpler than the four - dimensional version , making it useful for obtaining some intuitions about quantum gravity using gauge theoretical correspondences @xcite .",
    "however , given that this is too simple , it was doubtful that a black hole solution would be found in a three - dimensional background .",
    "the first analytic solution in three - dimensional gravity was found by banados , teitelboim , and zaneli @xcite@xcite .",
    "they found the black hole solution in an anti de sitter background . in their solutions , the negative cosmological constant played a crucial role .",
    "these solutions can have mass , charge , and angular momentum . moreover",
    ", the solutions can have the hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "however , they are thermodynamically stable because the specific heat is positive @xcite .",
    "the so - called btz solutions are useful in the context of holography .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , there is a relationship between the bulk three - dimensional gravity and the conformal field theory at the asymptotic two - dimensional boundary of such a three - dimensional bulk .",
    "that is , we may relate the gravitational perturbation on the bulk to the thermal excitation on the boundary field theory .",
    "moreover , it is known that the u - duality transformation maps four or five - dimensional black holes to three - dimensional btz black holes @xcite ; here , these black holes , which are connected by the u - duality , have the same number of microstates .",
    "hence , the microscopic derivation of the entropy can be replaced by the study on the corresponding derivation for the btz black hole @xcite . in these senses ,",
    "three - dimensional black holes are more important than just an artificial toy model .    in this paper",
    ", we will begin to study the dynamics of @xmath0-dimensional charged black holes , including gravitational collapses and back - reactions , using the semi - classical effects of hawking radiation .",
    "we solved time - dependent einstein and field equations using the double - null formalism @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "of course , it is too ambitious to extend this method to holography or string theory in this paper .",
    "however , if we establish a method with which to study dynamical black holes in an anti de sitter background , it will eventually become possible to study the time - dependent correspondences between the bulk and boundary someday .",
    "thus far , there is less reference to compare our calculations on the dynamic formation of three - dimensional charged black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas there is some literature on the gravitational collapses of neutral matter @xcite , especially in the context of critical collapses @xcite . on the other hand , in four dimensions ,",
    "there are numerous studies of gravitational collapses and evaporations @xcite@xcite .",
    "one important feature in four - dimensional dynamical charged black holes is the existence of mass inflation @xcite .",
    "mass inflation is a phenomenon in which the local mass function of an observer near the cauchy horizon increases exponentially .",
    "if it is true , then the internal structure of charged black holes can not be described by the reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite and the internal structure should be significantly modified @xcite .",
    "this was directly confirmed by numerical simulations , and there are more related works @xcite@xcite .",
    "three - dimensional gravity will be similar as regards this point , as it is expected that there is mass inflation in general in charged black holes @xcite .",
    "however , there are some expectations that three - dimensional mass inflation is different from four - dimensional cases @xcite . moreover , because black holes are thermodynamically stable in three - dimensions , it will be interesting to determine what the semi - classical back - reactions are in the internal structures of black holes ( there are discussions on the semi - classical effects in the static limit @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : pre ] , we summarize analytic solutions for three - dimensional charged black holes and discuss the mass inflation issue . the paper will then provide the theoretical motivations to study three dimensions . in section  [ sec : mod ] , we describe our model of the numerical simulations , the implementation to the double - null formalism , and comment on the initial conditions and dimensional analysis . in section  [ sec : dyn ] , we report the results .",
    "first , we report results for cases without semi - classical effects .",
    "second , we include semi - classical effects and observe how they modify causal structures .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : con ] , we conclude and comment on causal structures and cosmic censorship issues .",
    "in this section , first we briefly review the analytic and static charged black hole solutions of three dimensions .",
    "second , we summarize thermodynamic properties and internal stability issues via mass inflation regarding their solutions .        for three dimensions , the first simple black hole solution in the anti de sitter background is known to be the btz solution ( for non - rotating cases ) @xcite . for the einstein - maxwell action @xmath2 the solution becomes @xmath3 where @xmath4 @xmath5 , @xmath6 is electric charge , and @xmath7 is interpreted by the mass .    if @xmath8 , then we obtain a neutral black hole solution with @xmath9 . thus although this is in the @xmath10 limit , the center still contains a singularity ( @xmath11 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "the proper anti de sitter limit is obtained by the @xmath12 limit : @xmath13    if @xmath14 , then there can be two horizons : the outer horizon @xmath15 and the inner horizon @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 , then there are always two horizons with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( case  @xmath20 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) . however ,",
    "if @xmath21 , then the number of horizons depends on @xmath6 : for a small @xmath6 limit , there can be two horizons @xmath22 ( case  @xmath20 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) ; for a large @xmath6 limit , there is no horizon ( case  @xmath23 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) ; and the extreme limit , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( case  @xmath26 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) . in the neutral limit ,",
    "the singularity @xmath27 is space - like ( @xmath8 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ) ; in the charged limit , the singularity is time - like ( except @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to draw penrose diagrams in the static limit @xcite .",
    "penrose diagrams of btz solutions for @xmath8 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , case  @xmath20 ( there are two horizons ) , case  @xmath26 ( there is one horizon ) , and case  @xmath23 ( there is no horizon but a time - like singularity ) . ]    the hawking temperature @xmath30 becomes @xmath31 and @xmath30 is positive or zero because @xmath15 is greater than the extreme limit size @xmath32 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the entropy @xmath33 becomes @xmath34 however , the specific heat @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 and hence the black hole is in thermal equilibrium and the outer horizon does not shrink @xcite .",
    "therefore , when we consider the dynamical formation of a black hole , the outer horizon should be always space - like or null .    note",
    "that in the double - null coordinates , @xmath37 the einstein equation for the @xmath38 component around the outer apparent horizon @xmath39 is @xmath40 therefore , the outer apparent horizon is space - like or null if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , for btz solutions , even when they are dynamically generated with a hawking temperature , @xmath42 should be positive or @xmath43 around the outer apparent horizon .",
    "there are a number of discussions on the instability of cauchy horizons @xmath16 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we can re - write the metric in the following form : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the space dimensions ( @xmath26 or @xmath23 ) . now , without loss of generality , we can ignore the angular part to discuss in - going or out - going null geodesics .",
    "thus , for an in - falling matter along the in - going null direction ( for coordinates @xmath46 $ ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor components @xmath47 can be represented by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary function that refers to the luminosity function @xcite@xcite . at this point , if there is an observer who moves along the out - going null direction and approaches the cauchy horizon @xmath16 , then for a null geodesic of the observer @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 around the @xmath53 limit , where @xmath54 is an affine parameter of the observer and @xmath55 is the surface gravity of the inner horizon . in conclusion ,",
    "the out - going observer who approaches the cauchy horizon measures the energy density for the energy flow that flows along the cauchy horizon by @xcite@xcite : @xmath56    note that for four dimensions , for a realistic black hole the behavior of the luminosity function should be polynomial to @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "although there is no such guidance regarding the luminosity function for three dimensions , if we believe that such a polynomial fall - off is reasonable for three - dimensional cases , then we can conclude that for both three- and four - dimensional cases , any small energy flow along the cauchy horizon is amplified for an observer who approaches to the cauchy horizon .",
    "this effect is known as _ mass inflation_.    therefore , the inner horizon can not be stable and there should be strong back - reactions due to high energy density @xcite . in many cases",
    ", it is believed that the cauchy horizon should be a curvature singularity @xcite .",
    "hence , we can not trust the static solutions to study the inside structures of charged black holes .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to introduce numerical tools to study these structures .",
    "we have two main motivations for this paper .    1 .",
    "* theoretical interests : * three - dimension is important .",
    "first , it is a toy model of a black string that may be possible in the early universe .",
    "second , as we commented in the introduction , in string theory , there is a holographic correspondence between bulk black holes in an anti de sitter space and its boundary conformal field theory .",
    "one can relate the gravitational perturbation on the bulk to the thermal excitation on the boundary field theory and one may restrict the perturbation by the spherically symmetric scalar sector .",
    "although the effect of the scalar perturbation on the boundary field theory is not yet revealed fully , our study and methodology on dynamical black holes may shed light on the study of the dynamical correspondence between gravity and field theory .",
    "* numerical interests : * according to previous discussions , charged black holes in three dimensions will have mass inflation around the inner horizon .",
    "this means that the inner horizon and internal structures can not be described by analytical methods . to induce this mass inflation ,",
    "the black hole should be fully dynamical .",
    "then it is inevitable to use numerical methods",
    ".    therefore , there are various interests to study three - dimensional black holes .",
    "to study internal structures , it is inevitable to use the numerical methods . in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamical formation of spherical symmetric charged black holes and its back - reactions for three dimensions .",
    "we prepare a complex scalar field with the maxwell field ; it is used to form a charged black hole .",
    "then , it will make it possible to understand mass inflation and the possible curvature singularities inside of three - dimensional black holes .",
    "moreover , we can include hawking radiation by introducing re - normalized energy - momentum tensors with the @xmath1-wave approximation .",
    "we can check whether the horizon behavior and the energy condition are consistent with the thermodynamics results , even when we include the re - normalized energy - momentum tensors .",
    "we can also determine the back - reaction of the re - normalized energy - momentum tensor to the inside structure of the black hole .",
    "in this section , we introduce a model for three - dimensional charged black holes . to use numerical simulations , we introduce the double - null formalism and discuss the details of the initial conditions and free parameters for the simulations . also , we briefly comment on the dimensional analysis of each functions and parameters .",
    "let us introduce the action in three dimensions by @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the ricci scalar , @xmath60 is a complex scalar field with a gauge coupling @xmath61 and a gauge field @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "the einstein equation becomes as follows : @xmath64 where the total energy - momentum tensors are @xmath65 the classical part @xmath66 is @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the re - normalized energy - momentum tensor part to include semi - classical effects , where @xmath69 .",
    "the field equations for the complex scalar field @xmath60 and the maxwell field @xmath62 are as follows : @xmath70      we use the double - null coordinates @xmath71 assuming spherical symmetry , where @xmath72 is the retarded time , @xmath73 is the advanced time , and @xmath74 is the angular coordinate .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite : the metric function @xmath75 , the radial function @xmath76 , and a scalar field @xmath77 , and define @xmath78    the einstein tensors are then given as follows : @xmath79    via the gauge symmetry of the maxwell field , we can choose the maxwell field @xmath80 by introducing the function @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we can obtain the energy - momentum tensors of the classical part with the cosmological constant term by : @xmath82,\\\\ t^{\\mathrm{c}}_{uv } - \\frac{\\lambda}{8 \\pi } g_{uv } & = & \\frac{{(a_{,v})}^{2}}{4 \\pi \\alpha^{2 } } + \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{16\\pi}\\lambda,\\\\ t^{\\mathrm{c}}_{vv } - \\frac{\\lambda}{8 \\pi } g_{vv } & = & \\frac{1}{4\\pi } z\\overline{z},\\\\ t^{\\mathrm{c}}_{\\varphi\\varphi } - \\frac{\\lambda}{8 \\pi } g_{\\varphi\\varphi } & = & \\frac{r^{2}}{4 \\pi \\alpha^{2 } } \\left [ ( w\\overline{z}+z\\overline{w } ) + iea(\\overline{z}s - z\\overline{s } ) + \\frac{2 { ( a_{,v})}^{2}}{\\alpha^{2 } } \\right ] - \\frac{r^{2}}{8\\pi}\\lambda.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is asymptotically interpreted by the electric current . if we define @xmath85 as the charge function , then @xmath86 and hence corresponds to the concept of the charge .",
    "there are several discussions pertaining to re - normalized energy - momentum tensors for three dimensions in the literature @xcite . as expected for two- or four - dimensional cases @xcite@xcite",
    ", the re - normalized energy - momentum tensors diverge along the inner horizon for the static metric .",
    "however , we know that the internal structures can not be described by the static metric for fully dynamical cases . due to dynamical situations and spherical symmetry , therefore , the following represents the best choice for the re - normalized energy - momentum tensor : use the @xmath87-dimensional results @xcite@xcite divided by @xmath88 and apply the @xmath1-wave approximation by @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the number of massless scalar fields .    after solving these coupled equations , we can write all equations : @xmath92 including the field equations @xmath93    at this point ,",
    "the equations of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 parts can be represented by first - order differential equations .",
    "we can then implement the same integration scheme used in previous papers @xcite@xcite .",
    "we used the second - order runge - kutta method @xcite ; however , due to the differentials in equations  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2 ] ) , our results will converge to the first order if @xmath97 .",
    "tests of the convergence are provided in appendix  b.      one important question when interpreting our results is whether or not these black hole solutions are btz solutions .",
    "of course , due to the birkhoff theorem for three - dimensional cases , we can be sure that our solutions will be btz ( for further discussions , see appendix  a ) .",
    "hence , there will be a natural concept for the mass function .",
    "first , we can define the general spherical symmetric metric in @xmath98 dimensions in the static limit by the following coordinates : @xmath99 where @xmath100    in many cases , function @xmath101 vanishes near the horizon ; hence , it will be convenient to redefine the coordinate in the following form : @xmath102 where the coordinate transformation is @xmath103 thus , we can show @xmath104 note that @xmath105 is negative outside of the black hole . therefore , the signature is fine .",
    "moreover , we can easily see that the apparent horizons @xmath39 or @xmath106 make @xmath107 , although @xmath75 is not zero .",
    "thus , in the four dimensions , we can define the mass function @xcite by @xmath108 also , for three dimensions , we can similarly define the mass aspect by @xmath109 this definition is consistent with the findings in the literature @xcite .",
    "integration domain of our simulations .",
    "we assign initial conditions along the in - going and out - going null surfaces along the arrows . ]",
    ".[table : conditions]summary of the assignments of initial conditions for @xmath110 ( the in - going initial surface ) and @xmath111 ( the out - going initial surface ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     therefore , we may conclude that , when @xmath112 , there is surely a central singularity while for the other cases this is not evident . of course , via the singularity theorem , if there is an apparent horizon , there will be a singularity anyway . for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 cases , however , there is no horizon . in these cases ,",
    "_ these exponents are circumstantial evidence that there may not be a singularity around the center . _",
    "( this conclusion is consistent with the result of @xcite . )",
    "of course , if the distribution of the charge drastically changes beyond @xmath115 , the central structure will be modified and our extrapolation will be meaningless",
    ". therefore , our prospect depends , in all respects , on circumstantial evidence and not on real evidence .",

    "bottom : @xmath117 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , for the @xmath121 case.,title=\"fig : \" ]      there are several studies in the literature that closely investigated the mass inflation in three - dimensional black holes @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting predictions was that there is a curvature singularity for a certain curvature component , whereas some of the other curvature components do not diverge as @xmath73 increases .",
    "we observed the ricci scalar @xmath59 ( figure  [ fig : ricci_p0 ] ) , where @xmath125 @xmath126 for an out - going null observer @xmath127 ( top in figure  [ fig : tuu_p0_2 ] ) , @xmath128 for an in - going null observer @xmath129 , for some out - going ( middle in figure  [ fig : tuu_p0_2 ] ) and in - going null slices ( bottom in figure  [ fig : tuu_p0_2 ] ) ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 ; @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 ) .",
    "note that we choose ( @xmath130 $ ] ) @xmath131 so that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "thus , any time - like geodesic @xmath134 can be decomposed by @xmath135 with constraint @xmath136 . hence",
    ", any time - like observer will see local energy density by @xmath137 therefore , if there is a signature for a case in which @xmath117 or @xmath116 increases exponentially , then it is the evidence of mass inflation .",
    "the results are interesting : there is no evidence that the ricci scalar or @xmath116 diverge , while @xmath117 shows exponential growth .",
    "thus , this provides clear evidence that there is mass inflation and that a curvature singularity forms around the inner cauchy horizon at the @xmath138 limit .",
    "however , this behavior of curvature functions is very different from that noted in four - dimensional cases . for four - dimensional cases , almost all related functions ( e.g. ,",
    "ricci scalar , kretchmann scalar , misner - sharp mass function ) diverge exponentially , while the ricci scalar and @xmath116 components do not diverge in three dimensions .",
    "therefore , this is a typical property of three - dimensional charged black holes .      in this section",
    ", now we turn to the semi - classical effects and see dynamical back - reactions for the inside structures .",
    "we put @xmath139 and vary parameters @xmath61 ( figure  [ fig : p ] ) , as was done in the previous section .    numerical results for @xmath139 ( with hawking radiation ) while varying @xmath61 . ]    for the @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 cases , there is a new horizon where @xmath143 . for the @xmath140 case ,",
    "there is a space - like singularity .",
    "hence , between the @xmath143 horizon and the central singularity , there is a fuzzy region and a cauchy horizon along an ingoing null direction .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath106 horizons can be separated as in the @xmath121 case , while for small charge cases , they are mostly foliated .",
    "because @xmath144 and @xmath145 both change their signs around the foliated region , any observer who moves through the horizon sees an increase of areal radius @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , it is a type of a bottleneck in a one - way wormhole .",
    "note that the size of the bottleneck is on the order of @xmath146 .",
    "for charged black holes in four dimensions , there was a similar effect .",
    "however , in those cases , the charge played a crucial role @xcite , while in three dimensions , the charge is not essential to see such a bottleneck , as we can see in the @xmath140 case .",
    "rather , it is the effect due to the negative energy via semi - classical effects that concentrated around the center .",
    "this bottleneck becomes a curvature singularity as the curvature functions increase exponentially around these regions . here , the charge will make the bottleneck relatively regular .",
    "this phenomenon will be discussed in section  [ sec : for ] .    as we increase the charge ,",
    "two horizons are separated ( in the @xmath121 case ) and the @xmath106 horizon even disappears ( in the @xmath112 case ) .",
    "this suggests that the amount of the negative energy decreases as the charge increases , approaching and exceeding the extreme limit ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the inner apparent horizon can be space - like while the outer horizon remains space - like .",
    "this implies that the null energy condition is violated only for inside and that it is not violated around the outer horizon .",

    "note that this is not due to mass inflation , because mass inflation does not make the ricci scalar diverge , as shown in section  [ sec : mas ] .",
    "also , this effect exists even for the @xmath140 case .",
    "therefore , we can clarify that this is a new type of curvature singularity .    as was noted in section  [ sec : dim ] , the bottleneck occurs via the violation of the null energy condition and the concentration of the negative energy .",

    "it is negative around the inner apparent horizon .",
    "note that around the inner horizon , @xmath157 if @xmath39 horizon is inside of the black hole , to increase @xmath144 from negative to positive , the inner horizon should be space - like , and it is equivalent to @xmath158 . therefore , this is a consistent behavior .",
    "finally , the fourth plot in figure  [ fig : energycondition ] shows the @xmath154 components . of course , the outer apparent horizon is space - like or time - like if and only if @xmath42 is positive or negative .",
    "however , we know that @xmath159 and that competition exists between the two parts . the first classical part is always positive , and hence , to see a time - like horizon , the second quantum part should be negative . moreover , it has to be greater than the first part .",

    "we understand that the @xmath138 inner horizons and the bottleneck of the wormhole become curvature singularities .",
    "the former is due to mass inflation and the latter is caused by the concentration of negative energy .    causal structures with hawking radiation .",
    "type  @xmath20 , @xmath26 , and @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : p0_types ] should be modified to type  @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 . ]    therefore , for type  @xmath20 ( figure  [ fig : p0_types ] ) , a part of the space - like singularity will be changed by a dvali curvature singularity ( left of type  @xmath160 , figure  [ fig : p_types ] ) .",
    "we can not trust beyond the dvali curvature singularity , since the curvatures become trans - planckian .",
    "however , as was discussed in section  [ sec : dim ] , if there are sufficiently large numbers of massless fields that contribute to hawking radiation without changing @xmath163 , beyond the @xmath143 horizon can be trustable in the semi - classical sense , as the curvatures , for example the ricci scalar , will decrease in proportion to @xmath164 .",
    "if this is true , our solution implies a branching - off geometry ( right of type  @xmath160 , figure  [ fig : p_types ] ) . for type  @xmath26 ( figure  [ fig : p0_types ] ) ,",
    "again , the space - like singularity should be changed by a dvali curvature singularity and the inner cauchy horizon should be changed by the mass inflation singularity ( type  @xmath161 , figure  [ fig : p_types ] ) . for type  @xmath23 ( figure  [ fig : p0_types ] )",
    ", the semi - classical effect can modify the inner horizon to be space - like and there will be a mass inflation singularity in the @xmath138 limit ( type  @xmath162 , figure  [ fig : p_types ] ) .",
    "of course , in that limit , the out - going cauchy horizon will be also a type of mass inflation singularity . in this limit",
    ", we may not see the dvali curvature singularity .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the dynamical formation and evolution of three - dimensional charged black holes . as a concluding remark , we summarize our new results and point out some interesting issues in terms of two points : classification of causal structures for dynamical black holes and cosmic censorship in three dimensions .",
    "we study gravitational collapses of charged matter fields and classified causal structures ( figure  [ fig : p0_types ] ) : type  @xmath20 for an almost neutral case , type  @xmath26 for a small charge , type  @xmath23 for a large charge , and type  @xmath165-@xmath20 or type  @xmath165-@xmath26 for an excessive charge . for near - extreme cases ,",
    "we show evidence that type  @xmath165-@xmath26 will be more probable .",
    "when there is an inner cauchy horizon in @xmath138 limit , a local energy density for an in - going null observer increases exponentially , and this confirms mass inflation . this will eventually create a curvature singularity in a large @xmath73 or large @xmath72 limit .",
    "however , this was significantly different from the four - dimensional case , as in those cases , other types of curvature functions also diverge .    as we include semi - classical effects via hawking radiation",
    ", we note that the outer apparent horizon is not affected and is thermodynamically stable .",
    "however , the internal structure will be significantly modified .",
    "negative energy is concentrated near the center , and this can create a bottleneck in a wormhole . such a bottleneck is not due to a charge but is caused by negative energy .",
    "this neck occurs when the semi - classical effects dominate the classical effects .",
    "we observed that the region around the bottleneck becomes a curvature singularity ( the dvali curvature singularity ) .",
    "moreover , the inner horizon can be space - like via negative energy .",
    "therefore , we delineate two types of curvature singularities in three dimensions : the dvali curvature singularity and the mass inflation curvature singularity . therefore , as we summarize these contents , the causal structures type  @xmath20 , type  @xmath26 , and type  @xmath23 should be modified to type  @xmath160 , type  @xmath161 , and type  @xmath162 ( figure  [ fig : p_types ] ) .",
    "one interesting finding was related to cosmic censorship .",
    "there is some controversy about whether or not there is a violation of cosmic censorship in anti de sitter space @xcite@xcite . in terms of btz solutions",
    ", there appears to be a time - like or null singularity for @xmath166 or @xmath29 cases .",
    "therefore , as long as we rely on the btz solution , a violation of weak cosmic censorship is not odd .",
    "however , if we believe that all realistic black holes should be formed by a gravitational collapse , our conclusions seem to say that there is no violation of weak cosmic censorship ( section  [ sec : cri ] ) .",
    "when there is no horizon and excessive charge , the tendency of the charge distribution shows that the energy density around the center is regular .",
    "the absence of a naked singularity has also been observed in four - dimensional gravitational collapses @xcite@xcite . however , in that case , as we give an excessive charge , a near - extreme black hole was formed rather than a disappearance of a black hole .",
    "this is an interesting difference between three dimensions and four dimensions .    in terms of strong cosmic censorship",
    ", there can be two ways to touch the cauchy horizon .",
    "first , there is the cauchy horizon along the in - going null direction ( e.g. , the thin red dotted line in type  @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : p0_types ] ) .",
    "second , there is the cauchy horizon along the out - going null direction ( e.g. , thick black dashed line in type  @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : p0_types ] ) .",
    "given that this black hole does not evaporate , for the former cauchy horizon , an ingoing observer requires infinite advanced time @xmath73 ( although this does not imply infinite proper time ) .",
    "thus , via mass inflation , it will surely be a curvature singularity .",
    "therefore , it is likely not possible to touch in the semi - classical regime . of course , it may be possible for an observer to touch the latter cauchy horizon .",
    "however , we know that when there are two horizons ( a space - like outer horizon and a time - like inner horizon ) , it is not evident whether there is a time - like singularity for an ingoing null observer , as we noted in table  [ table : fitting ] .",
    "if this is not the case , then strong cosmic censorship appears to be safe .",
    "the authors would like to thank bum - hoon lee , ewan stewart , and seungjoon hyun for discussions and encouragement .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly examine the birkhoff theorem for charged btz black holes .",
    "there is an argument that the only spherical symmetric solution of @xmath167-dimensional space - time with a negative cosmological constant is a btz black hole or the self - dual coussaert - henneaux space - time @xcite .",
    "this was applied only for neutral cases , and hence it is necessary to present an argument about the uniqueness of the solution when the electric charges are involved . in this appendix , we prove that any spherical symmetric charged black holes in a three - dimensional anti de sitter background will approach the charged btz asymptotically .",
    "the metric of a spherically symmetric space - time can always be cast in the form @xmath168 involving the two arbitrary functions @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "we put the gauge field by @xmath171 as the electric field strength must be of the order @xmath172 asymptotically .",
    "we may put the gauge field as an arbitrary function for completeness .",
    "however , this restriction of the configuration space is reasonable because the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath173 , constrains the form of the gauge field as equation  ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "the independent einstein equations are as follows : @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 represent the derivatives with respect to @xmath76 and @xmath177 , respectively .    from the @xmath178-component and the @xmath179-component of the einstein equations",
    ", we have @xmath180 . in addition",
    ", a time redefinition can absorb @xmath181 and it will make @xmath170 be the only function to be determined . from the @xmath182-component",
    ", we have @xmath183 .",
    "finally , from the @xmath179-component of the einstein equations , we obtain @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the integration constant and we can choose by @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , this proves our assertion .",
    "any spherical symmetric charged black holes in the three - dimensional anti de sitter background will approach the charged btz solution .",
    "to sure this expectation , we test the dynamics of scalar field around the outer apparent horizon . for @xmath121 and @xmath187",
    ", we observe the behavior of the scalar field ( figure  [ fig : hair ] ) . for convenience , we observed the real part of the scalar field as a function of @xmath73 around the outer apparent horizon ( @xmath188 ) ; the imaginary part is also qualitatively similar .",
    "the scalar field falls off approximately @xmath189 with @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath138 limit , the scalar field will decay to zero .",
    "therefore , this makes sure that our solutions will emerge to a vacuum solution in the anti de sitter .",
    "then , our previous proof shows that our results surely emerge to btz solutions .",
    "the real part of the scalar field as a function of @xmath73 around the outer apparent horizon . here , we used @xmath121 and @xmath187 .",
    "the gradients of each lines are approximately @xmath191 . ]",
    "now we test consistency and convergence of this paper .    first , to check the consistency , we used one of constraint equations .",
    "as an example , we choose the constraint function equation  ( [ eq : e2 ] ) @xmath192 to see the constraint .",
    "the value should be exactly zero , but due to numerical errors , it may not be zero .",
    "the normal scale of the constraint function is on the order of @xmath20 ; hence , if the value is sufficiently less than @xmath20 , it is certain that our simulations give a sound result .",
    "top in figure  [ fig : convergence ] shows the constraint function for the @xmath139 and @xmath121 case along the @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath119 slices .",
    "the result is sufficiently small and the order is less than @xmath195 .",
    "note that when the constraint becomes on the order of @xmath195 , the @xmath196 actually approaches zero and the behavior of the constraint function becomes unstable .",
    "however , this is not a significant problem for entire causal structures .",
    "second , to check the convergence , we first see @xmath197 and @xmath198 along the @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath119 slices , where @xmath199 means an @xmath200 finer simulation ( middle in figure  [ fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "we checked for the @xmath121 and @xmath187 case . for each slice ,",
    "two curves are almost same ; this shows the second order convergence .",
    "numerical errors are less than @xmath201 .",
    "next , we test the @xmath121 and @xmath139 case ( bottom in figure  [ fig : convergence ] ) and compare @xmath197 and @xmath202 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the dynamical formation and evolution of @xmath0-dimensional charged black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically study dynamical collapses of charged matter fields in an anti de sitter background and note the formation of black holes using the double - null formalism . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we include re - normalized energy - momentum tensors assuming the @xmath1-wave approximation to determine thermodynamical back - reactions to the internal structures . </S>",
    "<S> if there is no semi - classical effects , the amount of charge determines the causal structures . </S>",
    "<S> if the charge is sufficiently small , the causal structure has a space - like singularity . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the charge increases , an inner cauchy horizon appears . </S>",
    "<S> if we have sufficient charge , we see a space - like outer horizon and a time - like inner horizon , and if we give excessive charge , black hole horizons disappear . </S>",
    "<S> we have some circumstantial evidences that weak cosmic censorship is still satisfied , even for such excessive charge cases . also , we confirm that there is mass inflation along the inner horizon , although the properties are quite different from those of four - dimensional cases . </S>",
    "<S> semi - classical back - reactions will not affect the outer horizon , but they will affect the inner horizon . near the center , there is a place where negative energy is concentrated . thus , charged black holes in three dimensions have two types of curvature singularities in general : via mass inflation and via a concentration of negative energy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we classify possible causal structures . </S>"
