    "let @xmath1 be a simple undirected graph ( without loops ) with vertex set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath3 .",
    "a proper @xmath4-coloring @xmath5 of @xmath0 is a mapping @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "a legal or proper @xmath4-coloring can also be defined as a partition of @xmath8 into @xmath4 independent sets or stables @xmath9 such that @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the classical graph coloring problem ( gcp ) aims at finding a proper @xmath4-coloring with @xmath4 minimum .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the np - hard minimum sum coloring problem ( mscp ) , which is closely related to gcp .",
    "the objective of mscp is to find a proper @xmath4-coloring which minimizes the sum of the colors assigned to the vertices .",
    "this minimum is the chromatic sum @xmath12 of @xmath0 : @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the set of all proper @xmath4-colorings of @xmath0 ( for all possible @xmath4 values ) and @xmath15 , or @xmath16 equivalently ( where @xmath17 is the cardinality of @xmath18 ) , the `` coloring sum '' of the proper @xmath4-coloring @xmath5 .",
    "mscp applications include vlsi design , scheduling , and resource allocation @xcite .",
    "considering the theoretical intractability of mscp , a number of heuristic algorithms have been proposed to find suboptimal solutions , such as a parallel genetic algorithm , two greedy heuristics , a tabu search metaheuristic , a hybrid algorithm ( ha ) , an effective heuristic algorithm ( exscol ) , a local search heuristic ( mds5 ) , and a breakout local search ( bls ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "exscol , ha , mds5 , and bls are the state - of - the - art algorithms in the literature .",
    "exscol is based on extracting large disjoint independent sets and is particular effective for handling large graphs ( with at least 500 vertices ) .",
    "ha is a hybrid algorithm which combines a genetic algorithm with a surrogate constraint heuristic .",
    "mds5 is based on variable neighborhood search and iterated local search .",
    "bls combines local search with adaptive perturbation mechanisms to ensure the quality of solutions .",
    "this paper introduces a memetic algorithm for the minimum sum coloring problem ( masc ) , which relies on three key components .",
    "first , a double - neighborhood tabu search procedure is especially designed for mscp ( dnts ) .",
    "dnts is based on a token - ring application of two complementary neighborhoods to explore the search space and a perturbation strategy to escape from local optima .",
    "second , a multi - parent crossover operator is used for solution recombination .",
    "basically , it tries to transmit large color classes from the parents to the offspring .",
    "finally , a population updating mechanism is devised to determine how the offspring solution is inserted into the population .",
    "we evaluate the performance of masc on 77 well - known graphs from dimacs and color 2002 - 2004 graph coloring competitions ( 59 of them have been used previously for evaluating sum coloring algorithms ) .",
    "the computational results show that masc can frequently match the best known results in the literature for most of the 59 cases .",
    "in particular , it improves the previous best solution for 17 graphs for which an upper bound is known . for the additional 18 new graphs , we report computational results for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section describes the general framework and the components of our masc memetic algorithm , including the population initialization , the crossover operator and the double - neighborhood tabu search procedure .",
    "detailed computational results and comparisons with five state - of - the - art algorithms are presented in section [ sec_results ] . before concluding , section [ sec_analysis_masc ] investigates and analyzes two key issues of the proposed memetic algorithm",
    "a memetic algorithm is a population - based approach where the traditional mutation operator is replaced by a local search procedure .",
    "memetic algorithms are among the most powerful paradigms for solving np - hard combinatorial optimization problems . in particular",
    ", they have been successfully applied to the tightly related gcp .",
    "our masc algorithm is summarized in algorithm [ algo_masc ] .",
    "after population initialization , masc repeats a series of generations ( limited to @xmath19 ) to explore the search space which is defined by the set of all proper @xmath4-colorings ( @xmath4 is not a fixed value , section [ search space ] ) . at each generation ,",
    "two or more parents are selected at random ( line 6 ) and used by the dedicated crossover operator to generate an offspring solution ( line 7 , section [ subsec_sol_crossover_operator ] ) .",
    "the offspring solution is then improved by a double neighborhood tabu search ( line 8 , section [ subsec_sol_ts ] ) .",
    "if the improved offspring has a better sum of colors , it is then used to update the current best solution found so far ( lines 9 - 10 ) .",
    "finally , the population updating criterion decides whether the improved offspring will replace one existing individual of the population or not ( line 12 , section [ subsec_sol_population_update ] ) .",

    "its quality is directly assessed by the sum of colors @xmath34 .",
    "our algorithm begins with a population @xmath23 of @xmath24 feasible colorings .",
    "this population can be obtained by any graph coloring algorithm that is able to generate different proper colorings for a graph . in our case",

    ", tabucol tries to find a proper @xmath4-coloring with @xmath4 as small as possible .",
    "given the stochastic nature of tabucol , we run it multiple times to obtain different @xmath4-colorings ( @xmath4 may take different values ) .",

    "the crossover operator is an important component in a population - based algorithm .",
    "it is used to generate one or more new offspring individuals to discover new promising search areas .",
    "masc uses a multi - parent crossover operator , called mgpx , which is similar to the one introduced in as a variant of the well - known gpx crossover first proposed in for gcp ( restricted to two parents ) .",
    "mgpx generates only one offspring solution @xmath30 from @xmath35 parents randomly chosen from @xmath23 , where @xmath35 varies from 2 to 4 according to @xmath36 and the best @xmath4-coloring found for gcp ( see eq . [ eqnbparents ] ) .",

    "it builds the color classes of the @xmath30 offspring one by one , transmitting as many vertices as possible from the parents at each step ( for quality purpose ) ( lines 7 - 14 ) .",
    "once a parent has been used for transmitting an entire color class to @xmath30 , the parent is not considered for a few steps with the purpose of varying the origins of the color classes of @xmath30 ( line 15 ) .",
    "this strategy avoids transmitting always from the same parent and introduces some diversity in @xmath30 .",
    "note that the offspring solution is always a proper @xmath4 coloring while the number of colors used by the offspring can be higher than those of the considered parents .",
    "local optimization is another important element within a memetic algorithm . in our case ,",
    "its role is to improve as far as possible the quality ( i.e. , the sum of colors ) of a given solution returned by the mgpx crossover operator .",
    "this is achieved by a double - neighborhood tabu search ( dnts ) procedure specifically designed for mscp ( see algorithm [ algo_tabu ] ) .",
    "dnts uses two different and complementary neighborhoods @xmath53 and @xmath54 which are applied in a token - ring way @xcite to find good local optima ( intensification ) ( lines 2 - 14 ) .",
    "more precisely , we start our search with one neighborhood ( lines 6 - 9 ) and when the search ends with its best local optimum , we switch to the other neighborhood to continue the search while using the last local optimum as the starting point ( lines 10 - 13 ) .",
    "when this second search terminates , we switch again to the first neighborhood and so on .",
    "dnts continues the exploration of each neighborhood @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) until @xmath57 ( @xmath56 ) consecutive iterations fail to update the best solution found .",
    "this neighborhood - based intensification phase terminates if the best local optimum is not updated for @xmath58 consecutive iterations ( line 14 ) . at this point",
    ", we enter into a diversification phase by triggering a perturbation to escape from the local optimum ( line 15 , section [ subsec_sol_perturbation_mechanism ] ) .",
