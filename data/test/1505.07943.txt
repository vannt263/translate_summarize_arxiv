    "two - dimensional non - bipartite lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions between spin-1/2 moments are amongst the most studied , as antiferromagnetic order is most severely challenged by quantum fluctuations there .",

    "these simplified models advantageously allow for a better analytical handle and understanding of the physics of spin liquids , but their connection to su(2 ) microscopic hamiltonians is not always direct .",
    "another route to realizing exotic phases of matter is to start from a model with highly degenerate manifold of ground states ( _ ice manifold _ ) obeying local constraints and then derive an effective hamiltonian describing the emergent degrees of freedom in this manifold @xcite . following this strategy ,",
    "balents , fisher and girvin ( bfg ) introduced a spin-1/2 xxz model with extended interactions on the kagom lattice  @xcite . using a generalized qdm derived for low energies",
    ", these authors argued that this system hosted a topological gapped @xmath3 spin liquid phase  @xcite , which was further confirmed numerically in subsequent works  @xcite .",
    "one of the hallmarks of a @xmath3 liquid phase is the existence of a topological correction to entanglement entropy , which was shown to be present in the bfg model  @xcite .    in considering the nature of the ( gapped ) phases resulting from the destruction of antiferromagnetic order ,",
    "one important guiding principle is provided by a general statement about the relation between the presence / absence of an excitation gap and commensurability .",
    "for instance , it can be rigorously shown @xcite that a given spin system ( in the absence of magnetic field ) is gapless when the value of total spin per unit cell is an half - odd - integer ( this is the case for , _",
    "e.g. _ , the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagom lattice ) and the ground state is non - degenerate .",

    "a simpler version of this argument @xcite applies to any spin-@xmath4 systems with u(1 ) symmetry and is of direct relevance to magnetization plateaux ( see @xcite for a review ) : a unique ground state with a gap is possible only when the number of spins @xmath5 within a lattice unit cell and the magnetization @xmath6 per site satisfy @xmath7 .",
    "recently , a field - theoretical meaning was given to this relation  @xcite and it was predicted that when the @xmath8 is a simple ( non - integral ) rational number , we may have gapped featureless liquid phases ( _ i.e. _ , spin - liquid plateaus ) as well as more conventional plateaus with magnetic superstructures .",

    ", we have checked that the simulations are ergodic for the sizes @xmath201 considered here . however , for smaller values of @xmath202 or larger @xmath83 , we indeed noticed a quick loss of ergodicity , even with the plaquette algorithm , translating into very different values at the three wave - vectors .",
    "the same behavior was observed in ref .   which used a similar qmc algorithm .",
    "second , we sometimes found a non - monotonic behavior of the structure factor @xmath197 for larger sizes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scalingsq ] ) .",
    "again , a similar behavior was reported in ref .",
    "where the increase of the order parameter was interpreted as the threshold where stripes start developing in the system . in practice , this complicates a proper extrapolation of the order parameter to its thermodynamic limit value .",
    "we can however compare the order of magnitude obtained with the value for a perfectly equal superposition of the three ordered states , for which a straightforward calculation yields @xmath203 .",
    "we conclude this section by a discussion on the possible scenarios for the quantum phase transition between the plateau ( stripe ) crystal and planar phases . since the stripe crystal breaks discrete lattice symmetries , one expects , on general grounds , that the transition will be of first order type , or that both phases coexist ( in a small region of the phase diagram ) .",
    "this latter scenario implies the existence of an intervening supersolid phase , whose presence was found in several similar models on other frustrated lattices  @xcite . due to the limited systems",
    "sizes available to us , we have not been able to favor one of these two scenarios .",
    "we observed ( data not shown ) an apparent crossing in the spin stiffness , with critical exponents compatible with a continuous phase transition , and no sign of a double peak structure in the kinetic energy histograms .",
    "however , it has been shown in similar situations that the correct nature of the phase transition may be difficult to capture . in the ( @xmath21,@xmath14 ) plane",
    ", varying the xy interaction @xmath21 at the constant field @xmath181 corresponds to a transition point located close to the tip of plateau phase ( _ i.e. _ the tip of the insulator lobe in the bosonic picture ) , for which previous studies have revealed that such a crystal - planar phase transition may appear to be continuous while it is in fact _ weakly first - order",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we believe that such a picture should also apply here , although proving this definitively would imply simulations on very large samples , which is currently out of reach for the present model .",
    "we have shown , using a conventional approach ( _ i.e. _ by guessing a broken symmetry and then measuring the corresponding structure factor ) , that the @xmath0 plateau corresponds to a stripe crystal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmccorr ] .",
    "it is interesting to check whether other means could detect the nature of the ground state without a priori knowledge on the broken symmetry .",
    "an elegant approach to obtain the dominant order parameter in an unbiased way is provided by the correlation density matrix  @xcite , but it is not easily accessible within qmc simulations . instead , we will focus here on using the entanglement entropy as a means to access the nature of the ground state .    indeed , in the recent years",
    ", a large number of studies have shown how the scaling behavior of a block entanglement entropy can give access to some ground state properties , such as the central charge in one - dimension  @xcite or the topological order underlying a given ground state wave function  @xcite .",
    "generically , any entanglement entropy ( whether rnyi or von neumann ) will scale with the `` area '' of the boundary between the block and the rest of the system ( the so - called `` area - law '' ; see ref .   for a review ) , possibly with interesting ( universal ) sub - leading terms : @xmath204 where @xmath5 is the rnyi index , @xmath205 the length of the boundary of block a and @xmath206 a constant for instance .",
    "topological phases can be detected using the constructions of levin - wen  @xcite or kitaev - preskill  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) , that enables one to extract a negative constant term @xmath207 , independent of @xmath5  @xcite , where @xmath208 is the topological entanglement entropy .",

    "the constructions of refs .",
    "@xcite use a subtraction of terms which all scale like the area of the subsystems considered , which can be troublesome in qmc simulations which inevitably exhibit finite error bars .",
    "computing the scaling of @xmath210 for a single block a ( without using subtraction schemes ) , is in general computationally simpler .",
    "this is what we performed for the case of our discrete symmetry breaking ( @xmath211 ) on the @xmath0 plateau , taking for a the geometry of a cylinder block embedded in a torus sample ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : renyi_vs_l ] ) .",
    "we expect that for such a symmetry - broken state , the sub - leading term will be a _ positive _ constant @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the number of degenerate ground states ( note the sign of @xmath214 ; see appendix  [ sec : appendixa ] ) .",
    "we first remark that , for the simple type of order on the @xmath0 plateau , the precise block geometry is not very important , which allows us to consider the convenient cylinder block geometry .",
    "second , it is quite important for this result to hold that all @xmath213 degenerate states ( quasi degenerate on a finite system but with an exponentially small splitting ) are observed in the qmc simulations .",
    "hence , ergodicity must be ensured to extract the degeneracy , which we observe is the case if we are not too deep inside the stripe phase and system sizes are not too large .",

    "( with a small modification where the size of a is dynamically varied during the simulation ) .",
    "an important first observation is that if one considers only the smallest ( four or five ) system sizes , a naive fit leads to a negative intercept and thus to an apparent topological phase .",
    "one could perhaps interpret this unexpected finite - size effect in the following way : close enough to the transition to the superfluid phase , the superfluid correlation length can be of the order of , or larger than , the system size for small enough samples .",
    "effectively , the system acquires a superfluid component , which we expect to contribute to @xmath222 as @xmath223 .",
    "this form is derived in ref .   for a system that spontaneously breaks a continuous symmetry , in which case",
    "the logarithm prefactor @xmath224 is universal ( positive and related to the number of goldstone modes ) , and @xmath225 a non - universal constant .",
    "assuming such a form is also valid in a system which has effectively both superfluid and crystalline correlations ( _ i.e. _ , supersolid ) , it could result in fits that display a non - universal , possibly negative ( for small enough systems , since otherwise @xmath226 for large enough @xmath83 ) , constant intercept .",
    "note that it would be interesting to check this behaviour using simpler bosonic models that exhibit supersolid behaviour .",
    "however , when the system is large enough ( beyond @xmath227 in our simulations ) , we observe a qualitative change of behavior in @xmath222 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "note that this length scale coincides with the one where the stripe structure factor starts saturating , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalingsq ] . for these larger systems , entanglement entropies",
    "are compatible with a positive intercept @xmath228 , although the accuracy is not excellent .",
    "for instance , fitting our @xmath220 data using ( [ eq : sq ] ) and sizes with @xmath229 , we get @xmath230 , which deviates quite significantly from @xmath231 .",
    "indeed , as already advocated , a precise determination of @xmath206 is rather difficult due to the need of excellent ergodicity and hence large autocorrelation times for this quantity .",
    "typically , we need more than @xmath232 measurements to get reliable data .",
    "in search for magnetization plateaus of spin - liquid nature , we have considered the effect of a magnetic field on an anisotropic spin-1/2 model on the kagom lattice that was introduced in ref .  .",
    "in the easy - axis limit , this model is designed to exhibit several magnetization plateaus , at magnetization per site @xmath233 ( plus saturation @xmath19 ) .",
    "the properties of these plateaus have been investigated first by mapping the original spin model to simpler constrained models on the triangular lattice .",
    "focusing on the @xmath0 plateau , we have investigated in detail the effective quantum loop model and mapped out its phase diagram using a reptation quantum monte - carlo algorithm . from this , we predict a 3-fold degenerate stripe phase , that breaks rotation symmetry , to appear on this magnetization plateau .",
    "we have also observed that the @xmath0 plateau with the stripe order turns into a topological @xmath2 spin - liquid plateau when an additional repulsion among the dimer segments is added .",
    "then , we have performed large - scale numerical simulations using the sse quantum monte - carlo algorithm on the original microscopic model .",
    "this has confirmed the existence of a stripe phase found in the effective loop model , using both standard structure - factor measurements and its signature in entanglement entropies . in particular , we have observed that , for length scales shorter than @xmath234 , the scaling of the block entanglement entropy may be misleadingly interpreted as giving a _ negative _ intercept @xmath206 , while it becomes clearly _ positive _ for larger systems .",
    "this should be used as a caveat in other situations .",
    "when the xy - interaction @xmath26 increases , there is a quantum phase transition to a planar phase ( superfluid of the equivalent hardcore bosons ) .",
    "while it appears to be continuous in our simulations , we believe that it should appear weakly first - order on larger lattices , as observed for instance in similar physical situations  @xcite .",
    "we have not investigated in details the @xmath10 plateau , where the effective model is given by the standard quantum dimer model ( _ i.e. _ a single dimer per site ) on the triangular lattice , that has been widely studied in the past  @xcite .",

    "given that numerical simulations of the microscopic spin model are more involved ( larger systems , many different energy scales etc . ) , it remains challenging to detect such a weak order in the direct simulations for the original bfg spin model .    before concluding ,",
    "let us mention possible extensions of the model ( [ eq : bfg_model ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loop_model ] , we have seen that there exists a gapped @xmath2 spin liquid phase around the rk point of the qlm ( see fig .",

    "in fact , it is possible to consider additional interactions which would result in a non - zero interaction term @xmath51 in the effective constrained model ( [ eq : qdm_triangular ] ) .",
    "the four - spin interaction @xmath235 [ eq .  ] or the inter - hexagon third - neighbor interaction @xmath236 [ eq .  ] , that is not included in the model , should do the job .",
    "this could allow us to reach the @xmath3 liquid state at both @xmath10 and @xmath0 magnetization plateaus when @xmath237 , while the transition between the crystalline and topological phases could in principle be monitored by examining the rnyi entropy behavior .",
    "this extension of the bfg model would certainly be a very interesting playground to investigate such topological phases , their detections and their transitions to conventional symmetry - breaking states .",
    "also our construction is not restricted to spin-1/2 systems ( or to the equivalent hardcore - boson systems ) and applies to higher - spin systems as well .",

    "let us consider @xmath213 states @xmath241 , each corresponding to one of the degenerate states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this would be for instance @xmath242 and @xmath243 in an ising phase , or the three states with down spins occupying one of the three kagom sublattices ( and up spins on the other sites , see fig .  [",
    "fig : qmccorr ] ) , in the stripe crystal phase discussed in the main text .",
    "these @xmath213 states are always orthogonal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since they are simple product states , one can readily show , for any block @xmath81 of the system which complement scales with system size , that the reduced density matrix corresponding to a cat superposition of these states , @xmath244 , is given by : @xmath245 note that this equality only holds for the reduced density matrix , and not the whole density matrix .    on any finite system , since these @xmath213 states are exponentially close in energy , and a qmc simulation would sample each @xmath246 with equal probabilities .",
    "hence , one would compute a reduced density matrix corresponding to a mixed state : @xmath247 which is precisely the same object as eq .",

    "so our qmc simulation is able to access the reduced density matrix of the cat state , provided it is ergodic .",
    "now , each @xmath248 is excessively simple for each product state , as its spectrum contains only one non - zero eigenvalue @xmath249 since they are not entangled .",
    "moreover , they can be diagonalized simultaneously ( they are diagonal in the @xmath186 basis in our example ) , which leads to an entanglement spectrum with non - zero eigenvalues @xmath250 with degeneracy @xmath213 . from it , the entanglement entropy ( von neumann or renyi ) is simply @xmath251 .",

    "we emphasize that the same result holds for the mixed state obtained in our qmc simulation . for more realistic wave - functions ,",
    "the fluctuations around the ideal product state gives and area law , but the constant term will be unchanged : @xmath252    as a last remark , we would like to emphasize that in other more complex cases ( e.g. for states which are not one - site product states , such as valence - bond columnar states ) , the discussion is more involved as the constant term can now depend explicitly on the form of the cut as well as on the rnyi index @xmath5 .",
