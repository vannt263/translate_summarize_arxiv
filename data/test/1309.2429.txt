    "the former one has a featureless optical continuum or has very weak emission or absorption lines , while the latter has some strong and broad emission lines .",

    "3c  66a is classified as a low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbl ) , according to the peak frequency of synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "long - term optical variability or optical spectral variability have been studied by lots of investigators @xcite : the study of @xcite showed that the variability amplitude increased with frequency , and all these investigations showed the optical spectra turns bluer / flatter when the source brightens , although this tendency was strongly dependent on three data points in the study by @xcite , but this tendency was confirmed by many other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "3c  66a has been intensively monitored by two webt ( whole earth blazar telescope ) compaigns ( see * ? ? ?",

    "evidence of rapid intra - day variability was revealed .",
    "there was no systematic spectral variability in the high state ( r@xmath114.0 ) detected in this campaign , and there was no evident time lags among different optical bands by their analysis .    in order to investigate the variability , spectral variability and the time lag properties of this object",
    ", we monitored 3c  66a with batc @xmath2 schmidt telescope from 2005 january 26 to 2008 october 16 .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 , the variability , optical spectral variability properties and time lags are presented in section 3 , and section 4 gives a summary and discussion .",
    "observations were carried out with a 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope , which is located at xinglong station of national astronomical observatories of china .",
    "images were recorded by a ford aerospace @xmath3 ccd camera , mounted at the focus plane before the early of 2006 .",
    "the pixel size of this ccd is 15 microns and the field of view is @xmath4 , resulting in a resolution of 1.7/pixel .",
    "a new e2v @xmath5 ccd was in commission from the early of 2006 .",
    "the pixel size of the new ccd is 12 microns , so it results in a spatial resolution of 1.3/pixel .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a 15-colour intermediate - band photometric system , covering a wavelength range of 300010000  .",
    "the telescope and the photometric system are mainly used to carry out the batc survey @xcite . from 2005 january 26 to 2006 november 23 , observations of 3c  66a were performed with the batc e , i and m bands in cyclic mode , whose central wavelengths are 4485 , 6685 and 8013 , respectively .",
    "after that it was observed with batc c , i and o filters in cyclic mode , so most of our observations are in c , i , and o bands .",
    "the central wavelengths of c and o band are 4206 and 9173 , respectively .",
    "the field of view of the central @xmath6 pixels is large enough to cover the object and its comparison stars , so only the central @xmath6 pixels are read out for blazar monitoring to shorten the readout time . for a good compromise between photometric precision and temporal resolution , we took 30600 seconds as the exposure time for different filters , according to the weather condition and moon phase .",
    "all images were processed with a pipeline data reduction procedure including bias subtraction , flat fielding , position calibration , aperture photometry and flux calibration .",
    "the adopted aperture was 8 .",
    "the inner and outer radii of sky annulus were set to 9.1and 13 , respectively .",
    "comparison stars a , b , c1 and c2 ( from * ? ? ?",

    "their batc magnitudes were obtained by observing them and three batc standard stars , hd  19445 , hd  84937 and bd+17d4708 on photometric nights .",
    "the batc magnitudes of the standard stars were described by @xcite .",
    "the extinction coefficients and zero points were obtained by the observations of these three standard stars , then the instrument magnitudes of the comparison stars were transferred to batc magnitudes .",
    "these magnitudes and their errors were listed in table  [ standard ] . during the calibration , the instrumental magnitudes of 3c  66a and all the comparison stars were extracted first , then the object brightness was calculated to be the average of differential photometry magnitudes of the object relative to comparisons a , b and c1 .",
    "c2 was chosen as the check star , which was used to verify the accuracy of our measurements .",
    "for each image , the difference between the instrumental magnitude of c2 and the average instrumental magnitude of a , b , and c1 was obtained , then the difference between this value and its average over the whole night was defined as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 indicates the batc band c , e , i , m and o. ) for quantifying the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "the details on data reduction were described by @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the batc magnitudes can also be transferred to standard johnson - cousins magnitudes by the relations obtained by @xcite . covering four years from 2005 january 26 to 2008 october 16 , 3c  66a was observed on 89 nights , during which observation time ranged from half an hour to 6 hours from night to night , because of weather condition or other observation projects . in order to keep the accuracy of the following study ,",
    "all the observations with photometry error bigger than 0.05 mag were discarded , so the error bars of the magnitude were not plotted in the following figures for clarity . finally , 1994 observations from batc were produced .",

    "3c  66a was monitored by the 60/90 cm schmidt telescope from 2005 january 26 to 2008 october 16 on 89 nights ; 1994 observations in 5 batc bands were obtained .",
    "intra - day variability was analysed by the criteria presented by @xcite on 15 nights , on which the duration of observations in all three bands were longer than 2 hours , but no intra - day variability was claimed .",
    "one long term burst occurred during our monitoring ; the variability amplitudes in c , i and o band are 1.231 , 1.406 , 1.087 mag , respectively .",
    "the profile of the light curves in three bands are consistent with each other , and time lags between different light curves were analyzed by zdcf @xcite .",
    "the results from jd1 are consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the spectral variability was studied on long term , and short flare time - scale ; the results show that the spectrum turns bluer / flatter when the source turns brighter . some models @xcite state that spectra of blazars become flat when they turn bright .",
    "the spectral variability indicator is bigger on shorter time - scale ; this phenomenon may provide a constrain on the spectral variability mechanism .",
    "the interesting result that the minimum of the color index precedes the maximum of brightness by a few days was also detected in this paper .",
    "this means the optical spectra harden to the bluest state before a major outburst .    in the unified scheme of agns ,",
    "blazars are thought to have the jet structure well - aligned with our line of sight @xcite , and the jet is believed to originate and be accelerated by the central supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "two broad , well - defined components of the blazar non - thermal dominated spectrum can be identified .",
    "the low - energy emission is commonly explained by synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons in a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed to explain the high - energy component ; they can be roughly divided into leptonic or hadronic in origin , depending on whether it is electrons or protons which are responsible for the high - energy emission . while there are some hadronic models , which invoke protons as the ultimate source of high - energy emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the majority of the proposed models are leptonic models , which assume the high - energy emission comes from inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on some low - energy seed photons .",
    "the source of the seed photons is still an open question and many possible origins have been involved , such as internally produced synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photons from an external source , such as accretion disk or diffuse isotropic photons coming from broad line clouds ( external compton , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or combinations thereof @xcite .    based on our observational results ,",
    "we think the variability and the optical color variation could be reasonably explained by shock - in - jet models that involve relativistic shocks propagating outwards ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which was discussed by @xcite .",
    "the larger flares are expected to be produced by the emergence and motion of a new shock triggered by some strong variation in a physical quantity such as velocity , electron density or magnetic field moving into and through the relativistic jet .",
    "smaller variations may be nicely explained by turbulence behind a shock propagating down the jet @xcite .",
    "so jet models can produce different variability at different colors . in the usual boosted synchrotron models involving shocks propagating down the jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radiation at different frequencies is produced at different distances behind the shocks . typically , higher frequency photons emerge and stop sooner @xcite .",
    "this maybe introduces the result that the bluest state precedes the maximum of brightness .",
    "and we expect to see time lag which shows hight frequency flux precedes that of low frequency .",
    "this kind of time lag was detected by us even not in all cases . during the early phase of a rise in flux",
    ", one is more likely to see a bluer color .",
    "however , later observation during the same flare might show a more enhanced redder band as the bluer one might have stopped rising or may even have passed its peak .",
    "3c  66a a is typical bl lac object , whose flux is completely dominated by jet .",
    "the former situation should be more likely to be seen than the latter , yielding a predominance of bluer - when - brighter situations which was shown by our observations .",
    "the geometry of the jet may also affect the flux .",
    "the direction of the jet varies , which leads to the variability triggered by the variation of doppler factor , as the knots move relativistically on helical trajectories within a small angle with respect to the observer .",
    "this may produce the long - term mildly chromatic variability @xcite , while the intrinsic shock - in - jet mechanism may give a stronger chromatic short term variability .",
    "this scenario can explain the result that the spectral variability indicator is bigger on shorter time - scale .",
    "so we suggest the intrinsic shock - in - jet mechanism adding geometric effects may be the model of the variability of 3c  66a .",
    "more dense and long term simultaneous multi - color observations and studies should be carried out to understand and constrain the radiation mechanism well .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for numerous suggestions that helped to improve this paper . we owe great thanks to all the batc staffs who make great efforts to the observations .",
