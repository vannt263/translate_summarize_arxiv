    "shell models are dynamical systems ( ordinary differential equations ) representing a simplified version of the spectral navier  stokes or mhd equations for turbulence .",
    "they were originally introduced and developed bydfg obukhov  @xcite , desnyansky and novikov @xcite and gledzer @xcite in hydrodynamic turbulence and constitute nowdays a consistent and relevant alternative approach to the analytical and numerical study of fully developed turbulence ( see  @xcite for a complete review ) .",
    "shell models are built up by dividing wave - vector space ( k  space ) in a discrete number of shells whose radii grow exponentially like @xmath0 , ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 .",
    "each shell is assigned a scalar dynamic variable , @xmath3 , ( real or complex ) which takes into account the averaged effects of velocity modes between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the equation for @xmath3 is then written in the formex @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively quadratic nonlinear coupling terms ( involving nearest or next - nearest shell interactions ) , dissipation terms and forcing terms , the last generally restricted to the first shells .",
    "nonlinear terms are chosen to satisfy scale - invariance and conservation of ideal invariants .",
    "the main advantage shell models offer is that they can be investigated by means of rather easy numerical simulations at very high reynolds ( @xmath10 ) numbers .",
    "the degrees of freedom of a shell model are @xmath11 , to be compared with @xmath12 for a three dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence following the kolmogorov scaling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "shell models with nearest neighbour interactions are briefly reviewed . in section 3",
    "equations for mhd models with nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions are presented and conservations laws for the ideal case are discussed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to dynamo action in shell models and section 5 to spectral properties in forced stationary state and intermittency . in section",
    "6 conclusions are drawn and a brief mention to astrophysical applications is made .",
    "the simplest hydrodynamic shell model is the obukhov  novikov model , which is a linear superposition of the obukhov equation @xcite and the novikov equation @xcite .",
    "the model involves real variables @xmath3 and conserves the energy @xmath13 in absence of forcing and dissipation .",
    "it does not conserve phase space volume nor other quadratic invariants exist .",
    "the extension of the obukhov - novikov model to mhd is due to gloaguen _",
    "et al . _",
    "we write down the equations for clarity ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent respectively the velocity and the magnetic field in dimensionless units ) @xmath16 -0.85 truecm @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath19 is the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two arbitrary coupling coefficients .",
    "the ideal invariants of the system are the total energy , @xmath22 and the cross - correlation , @xmath23 which are two ideal invariants of the mhd equations @xcite .",
    "when written in terms of the elssser variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the equations assume a simmetric form and the conservation of the two previous invariants is equivalently expressed as the conservation of the pseudo - energies @xmath26 .",
    "it is remarkable to note that , unlike the hydrodynamic model , the mhd version satisfies a liouville theorem @xmath27 , impling phase - space volume conservation .",
    "the mhd equations conserve a third ideal invariant which is the magnetic helicity in three dimensions ( 3d ) and the mean square potential in two dimensions ( 2d ) , but no further ideal quadratic invariant can be imposed to this shell model .",
    "a detailed bifurcation analysis for a three - mode system was performed in @xcite for different values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the low reynolds ( kinetic and magnetic ) numbers , used as control parameters , allowed to identify a great variety of regions in the parameter space . turbulence was investigated with a nine - mode system which produces an inertial range with spectra following approximately the kolmogorov scaling @xmath28 .",
    "temporal intermittency was also observed and then reconsidered in more details by carbone @xcite who calculated the scaling exponents of the structure functions for the elssser variables and for the pseudo - energy transfer rates , showing consistency with the usual multifractal theory .",
    "other interesting mhd phenomena were also observed in @xcite such as dynamo effect and the growth of correlation between velocity and magnetic field in an unforced simulation .",
    "these phenomena will be treated in more details in the next paragraphs .    the complex version of ( [ previousmodel1 ] ) and ( [ previousmodel2 ] ) was thoroughly investigated by biskamp @xcite .",
    "the complex model allows to include the alfvn effect @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that is the interaction of a constant large scale magnetic field with small scale turbulent eddies .",
    "the main consequence of this effect should be a reduction of the spectral energy transfer rate and a consequent change of the spectra from the kolmogorov scaling , @xmath29 , to the iroshnikov - kraichnan one , @xmath30 .",
    "in this paper the alfvn effect will not be furtherly treated .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a complete discussion concerning the inclusion of alfvnic terms in shell models .",
    "shell models with nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions were introduced by gledzer @xcite . in particular the so called goy",
    "( gledzer - yamada - ohkitani ) model has been extensively both numerically and analitically investigated @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the goy model allows to conserve another quadratic invariant besides energy which was identified with the kinetic helicity @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the goy model to mhd can be found in biskamp @xcite .",
    "all the parameters of the model are now fixed by imposing the conservation of another quadratic invariant that can be chosen to distinguish between a 3d and a 2d model .",
    "a more refined version was then considered by frick and sokoloff @xcite to take into account the fact that the magnetic helicity is a quantity not positive definite .",
    "the situation can be summarized as follows @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following set of equations ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are now complex variables representing the velocity and the magnetic field in dimensionless units ) @xmath31 @xmath32 or , in terms of the complex elssser variables @xmath33 , particularly useful in some solar  wind applications , @xmath34 where @xmath35 here @xmath36 , being @xmath18 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath19 the resistivity , @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ nonlinearev ] ) , is a drag term specific to 2d cases ( see below ) , @xmath38 are external driving forces , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real coupling coefficients to be determined . in the inviscid unforced",
    "limit , equations ( [ nonlineare ] ) conserve both pseudoenergies @xmath41 for any value of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( the sum is extended to all the shells ) , which corresponds to the conservation of both the total energy @xmath44 and the cross - helicity @xmath45 . as far as the third ideal invariant is concerned , we can define a generalized quantity as @xmath46 whose conservation implies @xmath47 , @xmath48 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "thus two classes of mhd goy models can be defined with respect to the values of @xmath39 : 3d  like models for @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is not positive definite and represents a generalized magnetic helicity ; 2d  like models where @xmath58 and @xmath57 is positive definite .",
    "this situation strongly resembles what happens in the hydrodynamic case where 2d  like @xmath59 and 3d  like @xmath60 models are conventionally distinguished with respect to a second generalized conserved quantity @xmath61 here the 3d and 2d cases are recovered for @xmath62 where the ideal invariants are identified respectively with kinetic helicity and enstrophy .",
    "it should be noted that , although the hydrodynamic invariants are not conserved in the magnetic case , the equations which link @xmath20 and @xmath39 are exactly the same for hydrodynamic and mhd models .",
    "thus , once fixed @xmath20 and @xmath39 , it is a simple matter to find out which goy model the mhd goy one reduces to when @xmath63 @xcite . to summarize we have that ( with @xmath64 ) the model introduced in @xcite for the 3d case will be called , hence on , 3d mhd goy model or simply 3d model .",
    "it is recovered for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and reduces to the usual 3d goy model for @xmath63 .",
    "the biskamp s 3d model @xcite is actually a 2d  like model and will be called pseudo 3d model .",
    "it is obtained for @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and reduces to a 2d  like goy model that conserves a quantity which has the same dimensions as kinetic helicity but is positive definite .",
    "the 2d models introduced in @xcite and in @xcite coincide , they are recovered for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and reduce to the usual 2d goy model for @xmath63 . in the following the properties of the 3d model will be mainly investigated .",
    "the problem of magnetic dynamo , that is the amplification of a seed of magnetic field and its maintenance against the losses of dissipation in an electrically conducting flow , is of great interest by itself and for astrophysical applications ( see for example @xcite for an excellent introduction to the problem ) .",
    "shell models offer the opportunity to test with relative simplicity whether a small value of the magnetic field can grow in absence of forcing terms on the magnetic field .",
    "previous considerations about dynamo action in shell models can be found in @xcite . in that case",
    "numerical study of bifurcations in the three - mode system revealed instabilities of kinetic fixed points to magnetic ones or magnetic chaos .",
    "the existence of a sort of dynamo effect in mhd goy models was put forward by frick and sokoloff @xcite .",
    "the authors investigate the problem of the magnetic field generation in a free - decaying turbulence , thus showing that : @xmath73 in the @xmath74 case magnetic energy grows and reaches a value comparable with the kinetic one , in a way that the magnetic field growth is unbounded in the kinematic case ; @xmath75 in the @xmath76 case magnetic energy slowly decays in the nonlinear as well as in the kinematic case .",
    "these results have been interpreted as a 3d  turbulent dynamo effect \" and seem to be in agreement with well - known results by which dynamo effect is not possible in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the problem was then reexamined in @xcite in a forced situation looking at a comparison between the 3d mhd goy model and the pseudo 3d model .",
    "starting from a well developed turbulent velocity field , a seed of magnetic field is injected and the growth of the magnetic spectra monitored .",
    "system is forced on the shell @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , setting @xmath79 , which corresponds to only inject kinetic energy at large scales .",
    "method of integration is a modified fourth order runge - kutta scheme . in fig .",
    "[ fseps ] we plot @xmath80 and @xmath81 versus @xmath82 for the 3d model .",
    "angular brackets @xmath83 stand for time averages .",
    "it can be seen that the magnetic energy grows rapidly in time and forms a spectrum where the amplitude of the various modes is , at small scale , of the same order as the kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "( the subsequent evolution of magnetic and kinetic spectra will be considered in the next section ) .",
    "the spectral index is close to @xmath84 which is compatible with a kolmogorov scaling of the second order structure function .",
    "( _ diamonds _ ) and @xmath85 ( _ lines _ ) versus @xmath82 .",
    "the averages of @xmath86 are made over intervals of 3 large scale turnover times .",
    "time proceeds upwards .",
    "the kinetic spectrum is averaged over 30 large scale turnover times .",
    "the straight line has slope @xmath87 .",
    "parameters used : n=24 , @xmath88 , @xmath89    for a comparison we integrated the pseudo 3d model and it can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ biskeps ] ) that a magnetic spectrum is formed , but it slowly decays in time . notice that , because of the smallness of @xmath15 , its back - reaction on the velocity field is negligible , thus the kinematic part of the model evolves independently from the magnetic one .",
    "now the scaling @xmath90 follows , as a cascade of generalized enstrophy is expected for 2d  like hydrodynamic goy models when @xmath91 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "( _ diamonds _ ) and @xmath92 ( _ lines _ ) versus @xmath82 . averages are made over intervals of 100 large scale turnover times .",
    "time proceeds downwards .",
    "the kinetic spectrum is only shown for the last interval .",
    "the straight line has slope @xmath93 , see text for explanation .",
    "parameters used : n=33",
    ", @xmath94 , @xmath95    the question now arises whether it is correct the interpretation of the growth of the magnetic field in the 3d model as the corresponding dynamo effect expected in the real 3d magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "first of all it should be noted that in the kinematic case an analogy with the vorticity equation predicts the following relations between velocity and magnetic energy spectra @xcite : @xmath96 , so that if @xmath97 it follows a magnetic energy spectrum growing with @xmath98 .",
    "the kinematic case corresponds to the first stage of growth of our simulation where this behaviour is sometimes visible , at least qualitatively .",
    "note however that the averages are made on very small time intervals because of the rapid growth of the magnetic energy . a similar",
    ", much more pronounced behaviour is found for the pseudo 3d model as well .",
    "let us stress that the sign of the third ideal invariant seems to play a crucial role as far as the growth of small magnetic fields is concerned . in effect",
    "this sort of dynamo effect can also be considered under a different point of view .",
    "let us consider the ideal evolution of the model @xmath99 .",
    "we can build up the phase space @xmath100 of dimension @xmath101 , by using the elssser variables as axes , so that a point in @xmath100 represents the system at a given time .",
    "a careful analysis of ( [ nonlineare ] ) shows that there exist some subspaces @xmath102 of dimension @xmath103 which remain invariant under the time evolution @xcite .",
    "more formally , let @xmath104 be a set of initial conditions such that @xmath105 , @xmath106 is time invariant if the flow @xmath107 , representing the time evolution operator in @xmath100 , leaves @xmath106 invariant , that is @xmath108 = y(t ) \\in i$ ] .",
    "the kinetic subspace @xmath109 , defined by @xmath110 is obviously the usual fluid goy model .",
    "further subspaces are the alfvnic subspaces @xmath111 defined by @xmath112 , say @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "each initial condition in these subspaces is actually a fixed point of the system .",
    "we studied the properties of stability of @xmath115 and @xmath111 .",
    "following @xcite , let us define for each @xmath106 the orthogonal complement @xmath116 , namely @xmath117 .",
    "let us then decompose the solution as @xmath118 where the subscripts refer to the @xmath106 and @xmath116 subspaces respectively .",
    "finally we can define the energies @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "note that the distance of a point @xmath121 from the subspace @xmath106 is @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath123 represents the square of the distance of the solution from the invariant subspace . at time @xmath124",
    ", @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) represents the energy of the perturbation .",
    "since the total energy is constant in the ideal case , two extreme situations can arise : @xmath73 the external energy remains of the same order of its initial value , that is the solution is trapped near @xmath106 which is then a stable subspace ; @xmath75 the external energy assumes values of the same order as the internal energy , that is the solution is repelled away from the subspace which is then unstable .        since the external and internal energies for the alfvnic subspaces are nothing but the pseudoenergies @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which are ideal invariants , the alfvnic subspaces are stable . as regards the kinetic subspace , @xmath129 and @xmath123 represent respectively the kinetic and magnetic energies . looking at the numerical solutions of the ideal model ( fig .",
    "[ eidealeps ] ) we can see the difference in the stability properties between the pseudo 3d model and the 3d one . in the first case",
    "the external energy remains approximately constant , while in the second case the system fills up immediately all the available phase space .",
    "this striking difference is entirely due to the nonlinear term , and in fact must be ascribed to the differences in sign of the third invariant .",
    "the effect of the unstable subspace , which pushes away the solutions , is what in ref .",
    "@xcite is called  turbulent dynamo effect \" .",
    "the main fundamental difference between hydrodynamic and mhd shell models lies in the fact that the behaviour of the former is not so sensitive to the type of forcing , at least as far as the main features are concerned . on the contrary in the magnetic case phase space",
    "is more complex because of the presence of invariant subspaces which can act as attractors of the dynamics of the system , hence the type of forcing becomes crucial in selecting the stationary state reached by the system .",
    "the spectral properties of the 3d model have been investigated by frick and sokolov in @xcite under different choices of the forcing terms . in their simulations",
    "they observe that the spectral indexes of kinetic and magnetic spectra depend on the level of cross helicity and magnetic helicity .",
    "in particular spectra with spectral index @xmath130 appear if the cross helicity vanishes . even in this case results",
    "may be deceptive .",
    "in fact , defining the reduced cross helicity @xmath131 as the cross helicity divided by the total energy , long runs @xcite show that , in case of constant forcing on the velocity variables , even from an initial value @xmath132 the system evolves inevitably towards a state in which the reduced cross helicity reaches either the value + 1 or -1 , corresponding to a complete correlation or anti - correlation between velocity and magnetic field . in terms of attractors",
    "the system is attracted towards one of the alfvnic subspaces where velocity and magnetic field are completely aligned or anti - aligned . due to the particular form of the nonlinear interactions in mhd ( [ nonlineare ] ) , the nonlinear transfer of energy towards the small scales is stopped . in this case",
    "kolmogorov - like spectra appear as a transient of the global evolution .",
    "this is shown in fig.[zmpeps ] where it is clearly seen a component ( @xmath133 ) which is completely vanishing while the @xmath134 spectrum becomes steeper and steeper as energy is not removed from large scales .",
    "if an exponentially correlated in time gaussian random forcing on the velocity field is adopted the system shows a very interesting behaviour .",
    "it spends long periods ( several large scale turnover times ) around one of the alfvnic attractors , jumping from one to the other rather irregularly ( fig . [ heleps ] ) .",
    "this behaviour assures the existence of a flux of energy to the small scales , modulates the level of nonlinear interactions and the consequent dissipation of energy at small scales , which is burstly distributed in time .",
    "what we want to stress is the fact that the alfvnic attractors play a relevant role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "this fact should be taken into account especially when a stationary state is investigated in order to determine the scaling exponents of the structure functions ( see below ) .",
    "two regimes , the kolmogorov transient and the completely aligned regime , could be mixed during the average procedure , thus leading to unreliable values of the scaling exponents .     versus @xmath135 at different times ( * a * ) black circles : the average of @xmath136 are made over the first @xmath137 large scale turnover times ( * b * ) white circles : the average is made after @xmath138 large scale turnover times ( * c * ) .",
    "the straight line has slope @xmath139 .",
    "_ right _ : the same for @xmath140 ]",
    "the  four - fifth \" relation @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the mean rate of energy dissipation and @xmath143 the separation , derived by kolmogorov in @xcite , can be generalized to mhd flows @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . a corresponding relation exists in mhd shell models , which can be derived following the considerations in @xcite .",
    "assuming for simplicity @xmath144 , the scale  by  scale energy budget equation is : @xmath145 where the quantities @xmath146 are defined as @xmath147 assuming that i ) forcing terms only act at large scales ; ( ii ) the system tends to a statistically stationary state ; ( iii ) in the infinite reynolds numbers limit ( @xmath148 ) the mean energy dissipation tends to a finite positive limit @xmath149 , we obtain @xmath150 @xmath151 these are the equations that define the inertial range of the system and that can be easily checked and confirmed by numerical simulations ( fig . [ kolmeps ] ) .",
    "it is to be remarked that these are the appropriate combinations that are expected to scale exactly as @xmath152 .",
    "let us finally remind that , as far as cascade properties of shell models are concerned , the major drawback lies in the difficulty to reproduce cascades of quantities that are expected to flow inversely , such as energy in 2d hydrodynamic @xcite or magnetic helicity in mhd @xcite .",
    "a deep understanding of intermittency in turbulence is nowdays one of the most challenging tasks from a theoretical point of view ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "a lot of papers have been dedicated in the last years to investigate temporal intermittency in shell models .",
    "deviations from the kolmogorov scaling @xmath153 of the scaling exponents in the structure functions , @xmath154 , have been observed and described in the context of a multifractal approach  @xcite",
    ". a precise calculation of the scaling exponents may have difficulties related to the presence of periodic oscillations superimposed to the power law . another source of uncertainty is linked to the exact identification of the inertial range where the fit should be performed .",
    "these problems are at lenght discussed and investigated in @xcite where a new shell model ( called sabra model ) has been introduced in the context of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the sabra model is a slight modification of the standard goy model and allows to eliminate spurious oscillations in the spectra .",
    "the same problems are in principle encountered in magnetohydrodynamic models thus a generalization of the sabra model to mhd is required ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach to the determination of scaling exponents for the 3d mhd goy model can be found in @xcite where concepts and techniques related to ess and gess @xcite are used .",
    "we have determined the scaling exponents of the structure functions @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 adopting a random forcing on the velocity variables ( on shell n=1 and n=2 ) to assure the system does not  align \" .",
    "the forcing terms were calculated solving a langevin equation @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is a correlation time chosen equal to the large scale turnover time and @xmath161 is a gaussian delta - correlated noise .",
