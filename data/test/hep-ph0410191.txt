    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite parametrize the non - perturbative hadron structure in hard exclusive processes ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "several theoretical predictions have been already produced by using different descriptions of hadron structure : bag models @xcite , soliton models @xcite , light - front @xcite and bethe salpeter approaches @xcite , and phenomenological estimates based on parametrizations of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite . besides , an impressive effort has been devoted to study the perturbative qcd evolution @xcite of gpds , and the gpds at twist three accuracy @xcite .",

    "we are interested in constituent quark model ( cqm ) calculations . in this framework , in order to compare model predictions with data taken in dis experiments , one has to evolve , according to perturbative qcd , the leading twist component of the physical structure functions obtained at the low momentum scale associated with the model , from this so called `` hadronic scale '' , @xmath4 @xcite , to the momentum scale of the data .",

    "a thorough analysis of both polarized and unpolarized data have shown , in previous work , that constituent quarks can not be considered elementary when studied with high - energy probes . certainly evolution is needed , i.e. the constituent quarks at the hadronic scale have to be undressed by incorporating bremsstrahlung in order to reach the bjorken regime . besides",
    ", the constituent quarks should be endowed with soft structure in order to approach the data .",
    "thus , the constituent quarks , when under scrutiny by high - energy probes , seem to behave as complex systems , with a very different behavior from the current quarks of the basic theory . these features , which we found in structure functions , have also been recently discussed in form factors @xcite .",
    "the formalism of composite constituent quarks has been recently applied to the study of generalized parton distributions , developing a formalism which expresses the hadronic gpds in terms of constituent quarks gpds by means of appropriate convolutions @xcite .",
    "the approach has been extended here to treat helicity - dependent gpds . to our knowledge , this represents the first calculation which gives , in a constituent quark framework , estimates of helicity - dependent gpds in the erbl region .",
    "following the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is done incorporating phenomenological features of various kinematical regimes .",
    "in particular , use has been made of the radyushkin s factorization ansatz , thus our constituent quark gpds are defined in terms of the product of three functions : i ) the constituent quark polarized structure function , where we use the parameterization of @xcite following the acmp proposal @xcite ; ii ) radyushkin s double distributions @xcite ; iii ) constituent quark form factor as suggested in ref .",
    "once the helicity - dependent gpds are defined in this way , we have developed the scheme to incorporate them into any nucleon model by appropriate convolution . in order to show the type of predictions to which our proposal leads ,",
    "we have used here , as an illustration , the ik @xcite model . however , in this latest step of our scheme , any non - relativistic ( or relativized ) model can be used to define the hadronic gpds .    as in the unpolarized case @xcite",
    ", the present scheme transforms a hadronic model , in whose original description only valence quarks appear , into one containing all kinds of partons ( i.e. , quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) .",
    "moreover , the starting model produces no structure in the erbl region , while after the structure of the constituent quark has been incorporated , it does .",
    "the completeness of the @xmath28-range , for the allowed @xmath7 and @xmath10 ( @xmath270 and @xmath47 ) , of the present description , is a prerequisite for the calculation of cross - sections and other observables in a wide kinematical range .",
    "relativistic corrections , which permit to access a wider kinematical region , could be included in the approach .",
    "we have reminded the reader of the calculation for the forward polarized structure functions to see how in this case , where experimental data are available , our scheme leads , even with a naive quark model , to a reasonable description of the data .",
    "thereafter , we have proceeded to calculate the gpds of physical interest to guide the preparation and analysis of future experiments .",
    "our calculation seems to be consistent with an ansatz recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this work is the continuation of an attempt to describe the properties of hadrons in different kinematical and dynamical scenarios .",
    "although our description can never be a substitute of quantum chromodynamics , it may serve to guide experimenters to physical processes where the theory might show interesting features , worthy of a more fundamental effort .",
    "useful comments by b. pire are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "thanks the department of theoretical physics of the valencia university , where part of this work has been done , for a warm hospitality and financial support .",
