    "the ultimate nature of the dark sector of the universe is the most relevant issue related with the negative pressure component required to understand why and how the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "a natural and simplistic explanation for this is obtained in terms of a tiny positive cosmological constant introduced in the einstein s equation for the universe . since the cosmological constant has a magnitude completely different from that predicted by theoretical arguments , and it is often confronted with conceptual problems , physicists have been compelled to consider other explanations for that @xcite .",
    "motivated by the high energy physics , an alternative for obtaining a negative pressure equation of state considers that the dark energy can be attributed to the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath1 which realizes the present cosmic acceleration by evolving slowly down its potential @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these models assume that the vacuum energy can vary @xcite . following theoretical as well as phenomenological arguments ,",
    "several possibilities have been proposed , such as @xmath3-essence @xcite , phantom energy @xcite , cosmon fields @xcite , and also several types of modifications of gravity @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging proposals concerns mass varying particles @xcite coupled to the dark energy through a dynamical mass dependence on a light scalar field which drives the dark energy evolution in a kind of unified cosmological fluid .",
    "the idea in the well - known mass varying mechanism @xcite is to introduce a coupling between a relic particle and the scalar field whose effective potential changes as a function of the relic particle density .",
    "this coupled fluid is either interpreted as dark energy plus neutrinos , or as dark energy plus dark matter @xcite .",
    "such theories can possess an adiabatic regime in which the scalar field always sits at the minimum of its effective potential , which is set by the local mass varying particle density .",
    "the relic particle mass is consequently generated from the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field and becomes linked to its dynamics by @xmath4 .    a scenario which congregate dark energy and some kind of mass varying dark matter in a unified negative pressure fluid can explain the origin of the cosmic acceleration . in particular , any background cosmological fluid with an effective behaviour as that of the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg )",
    "@xcite naturally offers this possibility .",
    "the gcg is particularly relevant in respect with other cosmological models as it is shown to be consistent with the observational constraints from cmb @xcite , supernova @xcite , gravitational lensing surveys @xcite , and gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the gcg model can be accommodated within the standard structure formation mechanism @xcite .    in the scope of finding a natural explanation for the cosmic acceleration and the corresponding adequation to stability conditions for a background cosmological fluid ,",
    "our purpose is to demonstrate that the gcg just corresponds to an effective description of a coupled fluid composed by dark energy with equation of state given by @xmath5 and a cold dark matter ( cdm ) with a dynamical mass driven by the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "once one has consistently obtained the mass dependence on @xmath1 , which is model dependent , it can be noticed that the cosmological evolution of the composed fluid is governed by the same dynamics prescribed by cosmon field equations .",
    "it suggests that the mass varying mechanism embedded into the cosmon-_like _ dynamics reproduces the effective behaviour of the gcg .",
    "in addition , coupling dark matter with dark energy by means of a dynamical mass driven by such a scalar field allows for reproducing the conditions for the present cosmic acceleration and for recovering the stability prescribed by a positive squared speed of sound @xmath0 .",
    "at least implicitly , it leads to the conclusion that the dynamical mass behaviour is the main agent of the stability issue and of the cosmic acceleration of the universe .    at our approach ,",
    "the dark matter is approximated by a degenerate fermion gas ( dfg ) . in order to introduce the mass varying behaviour",
    ", we analyze the consequences of coupling it with and underlying dark energy scalar field driven by a cosmon-_type _ equation of motion .",
    "we discuss all the relevant constraints on this in section ii . in section iii",
    ", we obtain the energy density and the equation of state for the unified fluid and compare them with the corresponding quantities for the gcg . in section iv , we discuss the stability issue and the accelerated expansion of the universe in the framework here proposed .",
    "the pertinent comparisons with a gcg scenario are evaluated .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section v by summarizing our findings and discussing their implications .",
    "to understand how the mass varying mechanism takes place for different particle species , it is convenient to describe the corresponding particle density , energy density and pressure as functionals of a statistical distribution .",
    "this counts the number of particles in a given region around a point of the phase space defined by the conjugate coordinates : momentum , @xmath6 , and position , @xmath7 .",
    "the statistical distribution can be defined by a function @xmath8 in terms of a comoving variable , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scale factor ( cosmological radius ) for the flat frw universe , for which the metrics is given by @xmath11 . in the flat frw scenario , the corresponding particle density ,",
    "energy density and pressure are thus given by @xmath12 where the last two can be depicted from the einstein s energy - momentum tensor @xcite . for the case where @xmath8 is a fermi - dirac distribution function , it can be written as @xmath13 } + 1\\right\\}^{\\mi\\1 } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the relic particle background temperature at present . in the limit where @xmath14 tends to @xmath15",

    "it is not mandatory for connecting the mass varying scenario with the gcg scenario .",
    "simple mathematical manipulations allow one to easily demonstrate that @xmath20 and @xmath21    noticing that the explicit dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath10 is intermediated by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one can take the derivative of the energy density with respect to time in order to obtain @xmath25 where the _ overdot _ denotes differentiation with respect to time ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ gcg02b]-[gcg02 ] ) into the above equation results in the energy conservation equation given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the expansion rate of the universe . if one performs the derivative with respect to @xmath10 directly from @xmath22 in the form given in eq .",

    "( [ gcg03 ] ) translates the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath1 into a dynamical behaviour .",
    "in particular , for a dfg , the consistent analytical transition between ur and nr regimes and their effects on coupling dark matter ( @xmath31 ) and dark energy ( @xmath1 ) are evident from eq .",
    "( [ gcg03 ] ) .",
    "the mass thus depends on the value of a slowly varying classical scalar field @xcite which evolves like a _ cosmon _ field .",
    "the cosmon-_type _ equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath1 is given by @xmath32 where , in the mass varying scenario , one identifies @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding equation for energy conservation can be written as @xmath35 which , when added to eq .",
    "( [ gcg03 ] ) , results in the equation for a unified fluid @xmath36 with a dark energy component and a mass varying dark matter component , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "as we shall notice in the following , this unified fluid corresponds to an effective description of the universe parameterized by a gcg equation of state .",
    "irrespective of its origin , several studies yield convincing evidences that the gcg scenario is phenomenologically consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this scenario is introduced by means of an exotic equation of state @xcite given by @xmath40 which can be obtained from a generalized born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 are positive and @xmath43 .",
    "of course , @xmath44 corresponds to the @xmath45cdm model and we are assuming that the gcg model has an underlying scalar field , actually real @xcite or complex @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath46 corresponds to the equation of state of the chaplygin gas scenario @xcite and is already ruled out by data @xcite .",
    "notice that for @xmath47 , gcg behaves always as matter whereas for @xmath48 , it behaves always as a cosmological constant .",
    "hence to use it as a unified candidate for dark matter and dark energy one has to exclude these two possibilities so that @xmath49 must lie in the range @xmath50 .    inserting the above equation of state into the unperturbed energy conservation eq .",

    ", we expect that the future precise data can provide more strong evidence to judge whether the dark energy is the cosmological constant and whether dark energy and dark matter can be unified into one cosmological background effective component .",

    "<S> a unified treatment of mass varying dark matter coupled to cosmon-_like _ dark energy is shown to result in _ effective _ generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) scenarios . </S>",

    "<S> coupling dark matter with dark energy allows for reproducing the conditions for the present cosmic acceleration and for recovering the stability resulted from a positive squared speed of sound @xmath0 , as in the gcg scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar field mediates the nontrivial coupling between the dark matter sector and the sector responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state of perturbations is the same as that of the background cosmology so that all the effective results from the gcg paradigm are maintained . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest the mass varying mechanism , when obtained from an exactly soluble field theory , as the right responsible for the stability issue and for the cosmic acceleration of the universe . </S>"
