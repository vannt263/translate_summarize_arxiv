    "in a remarkable series of papers @xcite by thiemann , the loop approach to the quantization of general relativity reached a new level . using ideas related to those of rovelli and smolin @xcite ,",
    "thiemann proposed a definition of the quantum hamiltonian ( wheeler - dewitt ) constraint of einstein - hilbert gravity which is a densely defined operator on a certain hilbert space and which is ( in a certain sense @xcite ) anomaly free on diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "the fact that the proposed constraints imply the existence of a self - consistent , well defined theory is very impressive .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether the resulting theory is connected with the physics of gravity .",
    "this question has been raised in @xcite , and this paper intends to probe it further .",
    "we will address two issues .",
    "the first concerns the commutator of two hamiltonian constraints .",
    "this topic has been partially considered by thiemann @xcite and in the preceding paper @xcite by lewandowski and marolf .",
    "thiemann argued @xcite that the commutator of two hamiltonians vanishes on diffeomorphism invariant states by commuting two ` regulated ' constraints and showing that , for sufficiently small regulators , the result annihilates diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "he also considered @xcite the function appearing on the right hand side of the classical poisson bracket of two hamiltonians : @xmath1 where the hamiltonian constraint is @xmath2 our notation is that @xmath3 is the spatial triad while @xmath4 is the densitized triad , @xmath5 is the field strength of the pull back of the ( euclidean ) self - dual curvature to a spatial hypersurface , and @xmath6 denotes the poisson bracket .",
    "thiemann was able to show that a quantum version of the right hand side of ( [ algebra ] ) annihilates diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "this is the result one would expect from classical reasoning as @xmath7 is the classical function that generates diffeomorphisms .",
    "thus , modulo factor ordering issues and anomalies , the quantum commutator corresponding to ( [ algebra ] ) should annihilate diffeomorphism invariant states .    in summary , thiemann showed that the algebra is consistent at this level : his quantum versions of both the left and right hand sides of ( [ algebra ] ) vanish on diffeomorphism invariant states . on the other hand , lewandowski and marolf",
    "@xcite explored the commutator of two of thiemann s quantum hamiltonians on a larger space ( called @xmath8 ) of states that are not necessarily diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "it was found that the commutator of the hamiltonian constraints continues to vanish , even on this larger space .",
    "such a result was also shown to hold for a large class of extensions @xcite of the original proposal of @xcite .",
    "this suggested that an inconsistency might appear , since the classical phase space function on the right hand side of ( [ algebra ] ) vanishes only when the diffeomorphism constraint is satisfied .",
    "following thiemann @xcite , let us denote this function by @xmath9 : @xmath10 we will discuss quantum versions of @xmath9 in this paper .",
    "in particular we will show that the original quantization of this function proposed by thiemann also yields the zero operator on the larger space @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", one could consider the calculation consistent .",
    "however , the price for this consistency appears to be  setting @xmath12 \" as an operator on this space of states ( more on this later ) .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that @xmath13 contains both the diffeomorphism invariant states of @xcite and , in particular , the ` physical ' states that solve the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "we will also show that there exist regularization ambiguities that allow us to propose quantum versions of @xmath14 and @xmath9 that are nonzero .",
    "however , the quantum commutator still vanishes , so the algebra is anomalous with this new proposal .",
    "this is discussed in section ii .",
    "the second issue concerns the computation of the commutator presented in the companion paper @xcite in light of the previous point : would it be possible to redefine the constraints themselves in such a way as to get a non - zero result ? and",
    "if so , would the result coincide with some nontrivial quantum version of @xmath9 ? from addressing these questions ,",
    "section iii will derive a rather general property that is necessary ( but not necessarily sufficient ) for operators of this type to reproduce the classical hypersurface deformation algebra .",
    "the following treatment works within the loop approach to ( euclidean ) quantum gravity and uses the now standard technology of spin networks and linear functionals thereon .",
    "we refer the reader to the companion paper @xcite for a complete description of the context and conventions employed here . some of the founding works in the field are @xcite .",
    "for a thorough description of this approach , see @xcite . for a description of spin networks ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the classical poisson bracket of two hamiltonian constraints , equation ( [ algebra ] ) , indicates that the commutator is proportional to a diffeomorphism generator . however , the proportionality is through an operator - valued quantity involving the metric .",
    "if one has a hamiltonian constraint defined on diffeomorphism invariant states , its commutator should therefore vanish on such states if the factor ordering is such that the diffeomorphism acts on the state first .",
    "thiemann showed from the outset @xcite that the commutator of his ( properly regulated ) constraints annihilates such states .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see .",
    "the action of thiemann s constraint on a spin network state @xmath15 is to generate a number of terms , each of which is a single spin network resembling @xmath15 but with an extra edge added near an appropriate intersection of the original spin network , and with the spins and contractor changed at that intersection .",
    "two successive actions of such an operator add a total of two edges in each term and the order in which the operators are applied affects only the position occupied by the new lines .",
    "in particular , it does not effect the overall topology ( or diffeomorphism class ) of the new graph or the spins or contractors .",
    "thus , the result is independent of which constraint is applied first if one is able to `` slide the added lines '' back and forth . sliding lines in this way is allowed when we compute @xmath16 for diffeomorphism invariant states @xmath17 in an appropriate dual space . as a result",
    ", the _ dual _ action of the commutator on ` bra ' states annihilates all such diffeomorphism invariant states @xmath18 . in this sense",
    "then , the constraints presented have a consistent algebra on these states .",
    "the previous paper @xcite considered a variation of this construction .",
    "we describe it only briefly here and refer the reader to the original work for further details .",
    "the basic idea was to consider an enlarged space of states , whose members need not be invariant under diffeomorphisms .",
    "we now consider a large subspace of this space which will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "this space is constructed as follows .",
    "suppose that we work on a three manifold @xmath19 and consider a spin network @xmath20 which we think of as embedded in @xmath19 . in this notation , @xmath21 is graph , the label @xmath22 assigns a representation of @xmath23 to each edge of the graph , and the contractors @xmath24 assign a certain type of operator to each vertex in @xmath21 .",
    "suppose that the associated graph @xmath21 has no symmetries in the sense of @xmath25 .",
    "that is , the only diffeomorphisms of @xmath19 that map @xmath21 to itself also map each edge of @xmath21 to itself without changing the edge s orientation .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for the more general case .",
    "we will not just leave this spin network at some fixed location in @xmath19 , but will transport it to other locations in the manifold .",
    "in fact , given any map @xmath26 which assigns a point of @xmath19 to each vertex of @xmath21 , we introduce a linear functional @xmath27 on the space ( @xmath28 ) spanned by spin networks . to define this functional",
    ", suppose that we have another spin network @xmath29 for which @xmath30 is related to @xmath21 by a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath31 , @xmath32 , for some smooth diffeomorphism @xmath31 that takes the vertices of @xmath21 to just those points assigned by @xmath26 .",
    "then we set @xmath33 denotes the unitary action of a diffeomorphism @xmath34 on spin network states and the matrix elements @xmath35 for the ashtekar - lewandowski measure @xmath36 of @xcite . for any other @xmath37 ( over the wrong sort of graph or in the wrong location ) we set @xmath38 .",
    "the states of interest are those obtained by ` smearing out ' these states with some smooth function @xmath39 on the space @xmath40 of all maps from the vertices @xmath41 of @xmath21 to our three manifold @xmath19 .",
    "that is , we are interested in states @xmath42 of the form @xmath43 while this sum involves an ( uncountable ) infinity of terms , its action on spin network states @xmath44 is well - defined since only one term ( the one in which @xmath26 maps the vertices of @xmath45 to the vertices of @xmath37 in the proper way ) can be nonzero .",
    "so , this sum basically says that @xmath46 acts on @xmath44 by moving @xmath45 ` on top of ' @xmath37 and then taking the inner product of @xmath47 and @xmath44 in @xmath48 , weighted by the function @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 is diffeomorphism invariant whenever @xmath39 is a constant function .",
    "if the vertices of @xmath45 are numbered from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , then we may rewrite the sum ( [ smoothdef ] ) as latexmath:[\\[\\langle \\gamma , f | = \\sum_{x_1, ...",
    ",x_k \\in \\sigma } \\langle \\gamma_{x_1, ...",
    "x_k }    @xmath26 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath39 is required to be a smooth function on the entire space @xmath53 .",
    "the space @xmath11 of @xcite consists of arbitrary superpositions of the @xmath46 , together with the corresponding extensions to graphs with symmetries .",
    "again , such superpositions may include an uncountable infinity of terms , so long as all but a finite number annihilate any give spin network .",
    "the constraints of @xcite are well - defined on this space , as are the variations of @xcite",
    ". such constraints also map @xmath11 to itself , so that commutators can be calculated directly .",
    "note that the generator of diffeomorphisms is well - defined and nonzero , and acts just by lie dragging the function @xmath39 .    at the intuitive level ( and in the typical case ) , it is not difficult to see that thiemann s constraint is well defined on this space of states and that it has a vanishing commutator with itself . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose that we evaluate the ` matrix elements ' @xmath54|\\gamma ' \\rangle$ ] of the commutator between the state @xmath46 , and the spin network @xmath44 , where @xmath45 has only one vertex @xmath55 .",
    "the idea is that the successive action of two hamiltonian constraints will add new lines at the intersection of the spin network , but the smearing functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 get evaluated at exactly the same point @xmath55 , ( the original vertex ) .",
    "thus , one gets a single term with a pre - factor of the form @xmath58 and the commutator vanishes . when @xmath37 has multiple vertices , these vertices do not interact with each other and the commutator continues to vanish .",
    "this is true @xcite even if one uses the version of the volume operator due to rovelli and smolin @xcite in the definition of the thiemann hamiltonian . in that case , the second hamiltonian acts not only at the original intersection but also at the newly added vertices ( the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski volume does not act on those vertices because they are planar , but the rovelli ",
    "smolin volume does not automatically vanish on planar vertices ) with nondegenerate tetrahedrons , the planar vertices are explicitly removed from consideration . strictly speaking ,",
    "this represents a breakdown of the arguments of @xcite when used with the rovelli - smolin volume operator .",
    "however , it is straightforward to generalize the argument so that the rovelli - smolin volume can be used and so that the hamiltonian acts non - trivially at planar vertices . ] . in this case , one gets a contribution with a prefactor @xmath59 where @xmath55 is the location of the first intersection and @xmath60 the one of the second .",
    "however , one removes the regularization by taking @xmath61 and the commutator vanishes for smooth @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , this should be a source of worry .",
    "why does the commutator vanish on non - diffeomorphism invariant states ?",
    "however , it could be that the states considered are not general enough and therefore that the commutator just happens to vanish on these states . to analyze this question",
    ", one should look at a quantization of @xmath9 .",
    "it is rather difficult to realize a quantum version of the right hand side in the spin network representation , due to the presence of the inverse metric .",
    "nevertheless , it can be done , as discussed in detail by thiemann @xcite .",
    "the idea is to break up the metric into two un - densitized contravariant triads @xmath62 , which in turn can be related to co - triads via , @xmath63 and finally the co - triads can be expressed in terms of a commutator of a connection and a volume , @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the volume of the three manifold .",
    "we refer the reader to thiemann s paper @xcite for the details , but the main point is that the resulting quantum operator for the right - hand side of the constraint can be written as a finite well defined operator times a prefactor in which the smearing functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are evaluated at the intersection point @xmath66 where the hamiltonian acts and at the end of an outgoing link @xmath67 from @xmath66 ; the exact form is @xmath68 in the notation of @xcite . in the limit in which the regularization is removed , the length of the segment @xmath67 shrinks to zero and the prefactor vanishes for continuous @xmath69 . we have therefore shown that the quantization of @xmath9 proposed by thiemann coincides with the commutator derived by lewandowski and marolf on the particular space of states @xmath11 defined above : both operators vanish .",
    "therefore , there is no anomaly or inconsistency at this level .",
    "however , an inspection of eq .",
    "( 3.7 ) from paper @xcite shows that the @xmath70 term in fact arises in the regularization from the factor @xmath71 . since the vector constraint factor @xmath72 may be treated as simply the infinitesimal diffeomorphism generator , the procedure of @xcite is tantamount to a regularization of @xmath14 which sets @xmath73 on @xmath13 .",
    "note that , while @xmath14 is not diffeomorphism invariant , this does not mean that it can not be defined as an operator on some space of states ( such at @xmath74 ) whose members are not diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "it should also be pointed out that thiemann @xcite has proposed a general scheme for regularizing a large class of operators that would include @xmath75 but not @xmath14 itself .",
    "this procedure appears to give a nonzero @xmath75 operator .",
    "however , the procedure of @xcite differs from the procedure used to regularize @xmath76 in @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the procedure of @xcite were applied to @xmath76 it would not yield an intact factor of the vector constraint @xmath72 on the left hand side of @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "the relationship between the operators resulting from these different schemes is unclear .",
    "further study of this issue would be worthwhile .",
    "let us therefore attempt to understand just why the aforementioned quantization of @xmath14 yields the zero operator .",
    "the root of the issue seems to lie in the fact that this quantization involves the prefactor @xmath68 , involving the smearing functions evaluated at `` close '' points @xmath66 , @xmath67 , but does not produce a corresponding denominator that goes to zero when the regulators are removed and @xmath77 .",
    "therefore one always fails to reconstruct the derivatives that appear in the classical expression ( [ algebra ] ) and one gets a vanishing result .",
    "this feature can in turn be traced to the quantization of expressions of the form : @xmath78 that were introduced through equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath79 is the metric volume of a box with center @xmath55 and size @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the characteristic function of this box .",
    "factors of this type arise in the constructions of @xcite .",
    "classically , expression ( [ trouble ] ) diverges in the limit @xmath82 : the denominator vanishes since it is the volume of a box of size @xmath80 , and the numerator is independent of @xmath80 because the poisson bracket is local .",
    "this divergence is , of course , canceled by other factors of @xmath80 so that thiemann s classical expression for @xmath9 is finite .",
    "however , thiemann s quantization @xcite of ( [ trouble ] ) has a _",
    "finite _ action at intersections of spin networks .",
    "the point is that he quantizes this expression by promoting the poisson bracket on the left to a commutator ( and replacing the connection with a holonomy ) .",
    "since his operator @xmath83 is finite as @xmath84 , the commutator is finite as well . as a result ,",
    "the other factors of @xmath80 cause his quantum version of @xmath9 and the corresponding version of @xmath14 to vanish .",
    "this suggests that the quantization is not faithfully recovering properties of the classical operator .",
    "it turns out that , within the general quantization scheme described in @xcite there is in fact enough freedom to alter this result .",
    "consider again the classical functions ( [ trouble ] ) .",
    "since the poisson bracket @xmath85 is really @xmath80 independent , one could replace @xmath86 with some @xmath87 in the poisson bracket @xmath88 , while keeping the same regulator @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , for small @xmath80 , @xmath86 scales as @xmath89 for smooth fields .",
    "if one now reworks the above argument keeping this in mind , one may rewrite equation ( [ trouble ] ) as @xmath90    the point is that , in the proposed quantization , @xmath91 yields a well - defined finite operator , which is therefore independent of @xmath92 .",
    "it is then evident that , by choosing @xmath93 , one can generate extra powers of @xmath80 in the the construction of the quantum @xmath9 . in particular , because four factors of the form ( [ trouble ] ) are used to write @xmath94 , the choice of @xmath95 provides the single inverse power of epsilon needed to convert the difference @xmath96 into the structure that appears in ( [ algebra ] ) .",
    "with such a choice one gets a non - zero operator @xmath14 which is well - defined on @xmath97 , although it is clearly not unique .",
    "one could imagine using similar tricks to rescale the quantum constraints so that their commutator is non - vanishing .",
    "we will consider the resulting expressions in the next section .",
    "however these manipulations are only formal in character . in order to yield a non - vanishing result",
    ", the commutator must be rescaled by @xmath98 .",
    "this , however , requires each hamiltonian to be rescaled by @xmath99 . since the original constraints @xmath100 were nonzero and well - defined , the new constraints are roughly @xmath101 and are divergent as @xmath84 . whether or not this can be dealt with through some sort of renormalization is unclear",
    "ignoring for the moment the issue raised in the last paragraph , one can ask what would be obtained if we would compute the commutator of two regulated hamiltonians and rescale it by one power of @xmath98 before taking the limit @xmath84 . we will not worry here about the details of how this is done .",
    "although thiemann does not explicitly use expressions of the form ( [ trouble ] ) in writing his constraints , they may be introduced through suitable manipulations .",
    "modulo perhaps extra powers of the regulator @xmath80 , the result is again an ` rst - like ' ( rovelli  smolin  thiemann - like ) operator in the sense of @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if there were no extra @xmath102 s , the commutator of constraints would still be zero @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath84 limit of the rescaled commutator is properly taken , one would expect it not to vanish .",
    "the point of such a computation is that one might think that extra powers of @xmath80 could be associated with some sort of renormalization .",
    "thus , without studying the details , we address the question of whether any such renormalization is likely to yield the classical algebra .",
    "the importance of the calculation lies in general properties that one may recognize as contributing to reproducing or failing to reproduce the result expected from the classical theory .",
    "exploring the theory in this way before removing regulators is reminiscent of manipulations performed in a lattice context @xcite .    instead of beginning the calculation",
    "immediately , let us first discuss the _ desired _ result . we would hope to find some analogue of the classical function @xmath9 . now",
    ", if there are no anomalies , one would expect the quantum commutator also to resemble ( [ o ] ) and , what is more , to have the factor ordering implied by ( [ o ] ) .",
    "this is because the constraints of @xcite are to be applied on ` bra ' states @xmath46 so that , in order for the algebra to close properly , the vector constraint @xmath72 should appear on the left .",
    "recall now that @xmath72 are the diffeomorphism generators and that the action of diffeomorphism generators are well defined on @xmath97 . given a vector field @xmath103 , the action of an infinitesimal diffeomorphism along @xmath56 on the state @xmath46 yields just the state @xmath104 with the same spin network @xmath45 smeared against the lie derivative @xmath105 of @xmath39 along @xmath56 .",
    "we note that this state takes the form @xmath106 as a result , one would expect matrix elements of the quantum commutator to be of the form",
    "@xmath107 | \\gamma ' \\rangle =   \\cr & & \\sum_{\\sigma \\in \\sigma^{v(\\gamma ) } }   \\left ( \\sum_{x \\in v(\\gamma ) } ( n ( \\sigma(x ) ) \\partial_a m ( \\sigma(x ) )   - m(\\sigma(x ) ) \\partial_a(\\sigma(x ) ) n )   \\langle \\gamma_\\sigma| \\widehat { q^{ab } } ( x ) | \\gamma ' \\rangle    { { \\partial",
    "f } \\over { \\partial ( \\sigma(x))^b}}(\\sigma ) \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if in fact the action of the operator @xmath108 commutes with the sum over @xmath26 . here , @xmath108 is some quantization of @xmath109 .",
    "the details of this operator , and therefore of ( [ expect ] ) , will depend on the form of this operator .",
    "still , one expects each term to have a prefactor @xmath110 and to involve a derivative of @xmath39 .",
    "also , for each vertex @xmath111 , one would expect to find a term involving @xmath112 .    for simplicity we will calculate the commutator only on a single state @xmath46 , where @xmath45 and a labeling of its vertices is shown in figure 1 .",
    "since @xmath45 has only trivalent vertices , we may fix the contractors simply by requiring them to be projectors . also note that the edge labeled by the spin @xmath113 forms a trefoil knot , as does the loop formed by traveling from @xmath55 to @xmath114 to @xmath115 along the straight edges and then closing the loop along the edge labeled by @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , these trefoil knots are of opposite chiralities , so that neither the graph @xmath21 underlying @xmath45 above nor the graph obtained from it by removing the straight edges connecting @xmath117 have nontrivial symmetries in the sense of @xcite .    as we do not know what to expect for the matrix elements latexmath:[$\\langle \\gamma_\\sigma    the commutator will be only schematic .",
    "we will not concern ourselves with the details of spins and contractors , but merely note how the lapse functions @xmath69 and the function @xmath39 are evaluated so that we can look for the derivatives which appear in ( [ expect ] ) .    to make the action of the hamiltonian more interesting",
    ", we will consider the case in which the volume operator is the rovelli ",
    "smolin one .",
    "the calculation for the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski volume is similar , but yields only a subset of the terms we will obtain .",
    "let us consider a bra state of the form @xmath119 where @xmath45 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we now act with two hamiltonians @xmath120 and @xmath121 . by `` @xmath122 '' and `` @xmath123 '' we mean two possibly distinct regularizations of the hamiltonian .",
    "the action of the two hamiltonians consists in fixing the vertices of the spin network @xmath124 at points determined by the regularizations .",
    "the first constraint can act only at the vertex @xmath115 and removes the spin @xmath125 edge between @xmath60 and @xmath114 .",
    "the second can only act at the vertex @xmath66 , and removes the edges between @xmath55 and @xmath114 and between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since we act with regulated constraints , when the first edge is removed , the corresponding arguments @xmath126 of @xmath39 are evaluated at points @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) that depend on the regulator @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) and of course implicitly on the positions of the remaining vertices .",
    "similarly , when the second edge is removed , the arguments @xmath129 are evaluated at some @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .    the end result is , @xmath132 \\langle \\gamma_{v , q}|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is shown in figure 2 and @xmath134 is some constant that depends on @xmath116 and @xmath135 .",
    "if we now take @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , the result is schematically of the form @xmath140 \\langle \\gamma_v|.\\ ] ] in particular , because ( [ smallsep ] ) involves evaluating @xmath141 at only two sets of arguments , it corresponds only to a set of terms having only one derivative each .",
    "thus , there are no terms like those found in ( [ expect ] ) , which contain products of @xmath142 with @xmath143 or @xmath144 and so involve two derivatives of @xmath39 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    if one had used the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski volume , then in fact @xmath145 annihilates @xmath146 for the particular spin network @xmath45 shown in figure 1 . however , in general the result is nonzero and the calculation proceeds along similar lines .",
    "this time , one finds only a contribution of the form @xmath147 ; that is , the only terms that arise have both @xmath56 and @xmath57 evaluated at the same vertex @xmath66 .",
    "the most general calculation for the rovelli ",
    "smolin volume generates only the terms in ( [ smallsep ] ) .    in all cases",
    "one sees that the hamiltonian is lacking the ingredients to produce the correct commutator , even if one could somehow reregulate the commutator to produce a finite result .",
    "in particular , one notices the first argument of @xmath39 in ( [ smallsep ] ) is always evaluated at the original vertex @xmath66 .",
    "thus , a term of the form @xmath148 , in which @xmath39 is differentiated with respect to its _ first _ argument , never appears .",
    "it is clear that hamiltonians of this general form which fail to move the vertex at which they originally act can not reproduce the classical commutator , since one is missing the term involving @xmath149 .",
    "thus , we see that the proposal of @xcite , which does not involve explicitly shrinking loops to points , also can not reproduce this structure .",
    "as we see from the previous calculation , the hamiltonian s action on the proposed space of linear functionals is tantamount to `` eliminating a line '' between two trivalent vertices in which , at each vertex , two of the incident edges join to make a single smooth curve .",
    "this in particular implies that all spin networks without such pairs of vertices are annihilated by the action of a single hamiltonian and therefore by the commutator of two hamiltonians . to have consistency , a quantum version of @xmath9",
    "would also have to annihilate such states .",
    "the point is again that we expect @xmath150 to act as a lie derivative , so that the only real freedom is the regularization of the operator corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , it would appear that @xmath151 would have to annihilate such states as well .",
    "one might think that hamiltonians which both add and remove edges would be better candidates to have a consistent algebra .",
    "however , we note that the ` symmetrized ' hamiltonians discussed in @xcite do just this , but still do not yield an appropriate algebra @xcite . in particular",
    ", one may repeat the calculation ( [ comm ] ) for the symmetrized operators and find similar results .",
    "in this paper we have studied two issues concerning the quantum version of the hamiltonian ( wheeler  dewitt ) constraint of gravity proposed by thiemann .",
    "we have shown that , with the regulation scheme of @xcite , the commutator algebra of two constraints is consistent on the space of non - diffeomorphism invariant functions introduced by lewandowski and marolf , but at the price of representing the contravariant metric @xmath14 ( contracted with the diffeomorphism generator ) by the zero operator on a rather generic class of states which includes the familiar diffeomorphism invariant linear functionals .",
    "we found a way to regularize the object @xmath9 ( [ o ] ) ( the classical right hand side of the poisson bracket ( [ algebra ] ) ) that avoids this problem , but then the commutator is anomalous .",
    "we then studied a rescaled version of the regulated commutator on non - diffeomorphism invariant states and found that , in this context , an algebra of the classical form will not be obtained unless the constraints somehow move the vertices on which they act .",
