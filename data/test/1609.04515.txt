[ figure - lj - tube](a ) ) . at large values of @xmath71 , the wrapped area fraction @xmath25 increases with @xmath71 .    the energy difference @xmath50 per particle between tubular and individual wrapping decreases with increasing potential range @xmath71 for all aspect ratios @xmath19 ( see fig .",

    "this decrease of @xmath50 indicates that cooperative wrapping becomes more favorable with increasing potential range , compared to individual wrapping .",

    "cooperative wrapping in tubules is energetically favorable only for partially wrapped particles because the energies of full wrapping are identical for particles in tubules and for single particles .",
    "the results for prolate particles presented in the previous sections indicate that the cooperative wrapping in tubules is energetically favorable if the particles are partially wrapped in their minimum - energy states .",
    "prolate particles are partially wrapped whenever not wrapping the more highly curved tips ` saves energy ' , and the cooperative wrapping in tubules is then favorable because both tips can remain unwrapped .",
    "cooperative wrapping in tubules can also be favorable for other particles with opposing tips or surface segments that ` resist ' wrapping .",
    "this resistance to wrapping can result either ( i ) from an increased bending energy cost of wrapping the particle tips , as in the case of prolate particles or other elongated particles with more strongly curved tips , or ( ii ) from low or vanishing adhesion energies at the opposing tips or surface segments .",
    "as an example , we consider here spherical triblock janus particles with opposing weakly adhesive or nonadhesive caps and a more strongly adhesive central surface segment between these caps .",
    "not wrapping the caps saves energy if the rescaled adhesion energy @xmath75 at the caps is smaller than 2 , because the bending energy cost of wrapping the caps then is not compensated by the adhesion energy . in membrane tubules ,",
    "both caps can remain unwrapped , and the overall wrapping degree @xmath25 is identical to the area fraction @xmath76 of the adhesive central surface segment ( see fig .",
    "[ figure - janus ] ) . for individually wrapped triblock janus particles",
    ", the central surface segment is fully covered by the membrane for sufficiently large adhesion energies of this segment .",
    "however , the individual wrapping of triblock janus particle then requires to wrap one of two weakly adhesive caps , with energy cost @xmath77 ( see also section 3.1 ) .",
    "this energy cost for wrapping a single cap corresponds to the energy gain for the cooperative wrapping in tubules , at least for area fractions @xmath76 of the adhesive central segment larger than about @xmath78 as in fig .",
    "[ figure - janus ] . for such area fractions @xmath76",
    ", the non - adhering membrane between neighboring particles adopts a catenoidal shap with zero bending energy . for smaller area fractions of the adhesive central segment",
    ", catenoids do not fit between the particles , and the bending energy of the non - adhering membrane has to be taken into account in the calculation of the energy gain of cooperative wrapping .",
    "for prolate particles and triblock janus particles , the cooperative wrapping in membrane tubules is highly stable relative to individual wrapping for all ranges of the particle - membrane interaction .",
    "with increasing interaction range @xmath71 , the stability of membrane tubules filled with prolate particles increases . since typical values of the bending rigidity @xmath7 of reconstituted lipid membranes",
    "@xcite and of cellular membranes @xcite range from 10 @xmath79 to 80 @xmath79 , the energy differences @xmath50 between tubular and individual wrapping of prolate particles obtained from energy minimization are in general large compared to the thermal energy @xmath79 ( see fig .  [ figure-0-tube](c ) ) and [ figure - lj - tube](b ) ) . for spherical particles with aspect ratio @xmath32 ,",
    "the energy gain @xmath50 for cooperative wrapping strongly depends on the range of the particle - membrane interaction , and vanishes for negligible interaction range because the particles then are fully wrapped both in tubules and as individual particles , with identical minimum energies .",
    "the high stability of particle - filled membrane tubules implies strongly attractive elastic interactions between the particles that are mediated by the membrane .",
    "in addition to these membrane - mediated interactions , the formation of membrane tubules can be affected by direct interactions between the particles , which are neglected in our model . in experiments ,",
    "the direct interactions of nanoparticles are typically repulsive or only weakly attractive to prevent aggregation in the bulk solution . however",
    ", neighboring particles in tubules need not be in close contact ( see figs .",
    "[ figure - lj - tube](a ) and [ figure - janus ] ) , and repulsive direct interactions only play a role for tubular stability if their range is comparable to the distance between neighboring particles in the tubes .",
    "we have focused here on the stability of membrane tubules and , thus , on equilibrium aspects of the cooperative wrapping in tubules . as dynamic processes , the cooperative wrapping in tubules and the individual wrapping of particles are in competition .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that particles with large adhesion energies are first wrapped as single particles as soon as they come in contact with the membrane .",
    "however , these particles are only partially wrapped in situations in which membrane tubules are stable , which impedes membrane fission processes of the catenoidal membrane neck that connects the wrapped particle to the surrounding membrane .",
    "such fission processes in general require fully or nearly fully wrapped states in which the apposing membranes of the catenoidal neck are in close contact . in partially wrapped states ,",
