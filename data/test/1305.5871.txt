    "below we focus on biexciton states which in general are described by a vector @xmath144 , where @xmath145 . the realistic ensembles of qds ( @xmath81 , @xmath146 , @xmath82 and @xmath147 ) permit superradiance phenomena in the two - exciton subspace if the biexcitonic , as well as single - exciton , eigenstates correspond to the dicke states . as in the single - exciton case , the biexcitonic state is considered to be superradiant if the exciton occupation of a system prepared in this state decays totally . although eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonians ] ) do not mix localized basis states associated with different exciton numbers , the biexcitonic superradiant state may be formed provided one of the single - exciton eigenstates has a superradiant character .",
    "thus the biexcitonic superradiant states occur only if collective effects are present in the single - exciton subspace . due to the equal number of single - exciton eigenstates and qds forming the ensemble the `` collective regime '' in the single - exciton domain",
    "may be achieved by adjusting only the decay rates ( dipole moments ) .",
    "as will be explained in detail below , the same rates @xmath148 ( [ gamma ] ) define the biexcitonic dicke states .",
    "thus , in order to achieve the collective effects in the two - exciton subspace one has to also appropriately adjust the spatial arrangement of the dots or energies .",
    "the superradiant two exciton superpositions may be spanned as well in ensembles of four emitters as in triple qds and take a form @xmath149 similarly to the single - exciton case , the biexcitonic superradiant states are defined by the maximum value of the transition probability ( @xmath150 ) , but this time from the initial biexciton state to the final single - exciton superradiant one ( [ bright ] ) .",
    "the form of the condition is governed by the coupling to the radiative environment [ hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniansrad ] ) ] which induces decay of only one exciton at a time .",
    "thus total quenching of two excitons must occur through formation of single - exciton superradiant states . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : biex_fig](a ) , due to the decay of the biexciton superradiant state a part of initial excitation is initially transferred to the single - exciton state which reaches a maximum population and then is totally quenched , together with the biexciton state .",
    "the condition for the existence of the superradiant state ( [ brightbi ] ) implies that the transition to subradiant states ( [ dark ] ) vanishes .",
    "two excitons can be blocked in a system if a transition from the biexciton state to any single - exciton state is forbidden , i.  e. the transition matrix element @xmath151 vanishes .",
    "due to infinite number of possible single - exciton states this condition reduces to the requirement @xmath152 . to simplify the description we define non - normalized amplitudes @xmath153 in such a way that the amplitudes of biexciton states @xmath154 . for a triple",
    "qd the condition leads to a system of three equations of the form : @xmath155 where every subscript @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 takes the values @xmath31 , @xmath124 , and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "the system is satisfied only in the case of vanishing amplitudes @xmath156 which means that it is impossible to block two excitons in a triple qd .",
    "the coefficients of a stable biexcitonic state spanned in a system of four qds must satisfy the system of four equations of the form : @xmath157 where every subscript @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath158 takes the values @xmath31 , @xmath124 , @xmath121 , and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "the above equations lead to the condition for the @xmath153 numbers in a form @xmath160 although in a system of four qds many dark states may be spanned , in realistic systems the parameters of biexciton states may be adjusted in such a way that only one , particular ( for specified values @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) state is blocked . thus , as in the ideal systems and similarly to the double qds ,",
    "@xcite the contribution of any pair of dots to the total biexcitonic population is constant in time ( @xmath163 ) .    in realistic qds",
    "one may realize either superradiant or subradiant biexciton eigenstate but never both simultaneously as in the ideal system . in both cases the basis is supplemented by a third kind of state which allow for a recombination of one electron - hole pair and trapping of the second exciton .",
    "the evolution of a four qd system prepared in this state is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : biex_fig](b ) and [ fig : biex_fig](c ) . while the population of the biexciton state decreases , the occupation of single - exciton state increases until it stabilize at the level corresponding to total trapping of one electron - hole [ green - dashed line [ fig : biex_fig](b ) ] .",
    "the third basis state must be orthogonal to the superradiant state ( [ brightbi ] ) , which equals to the requirement of vanishing transition matrix element between the biexciton state and the single - exciton superradiant state ( @xmath164 ) and means that the state @xmath165 has a subradiant character .",
    "the orthogonality to the subradiant biexcitonic state ( [ subbiex ] ) excludes contributions from the two - exciton dark states and thus the population trapping occurs only due to formation of a single - exciton subradiant state ( [ dark ] ) .",
    "since the transition to the state ( [ bright ] ) and thus the decay of single - exciton states is forbidden , one exciton is blocked in the ensemble .",
    "because the biexcitonic subradiant states can not be formed in triple qds , the requirement defining biexcitonic states which allow to block one exciton reduces to the orthogonality to the superradiant state , and the states take a form @xmath166 where @xmath167 . whereas , due to the orthogonality to the superradiant state the six amplitudes of the biexcitonic states spanned in ensembles of four qds take a form : @xmath168 where the coefficients must satisfy equation @xmath169 and , using further the orthogonality to the subradiant state relations , @xmath170    due to the existence of single and biexciton optically inactive states in ensembles of four qds the initial biexcitonic states allow for many combinations of final occupation",
    ". an arbitrary fraction of exciton occupation ( @xmath171 ) may be trapped by an appropriate combination of blocked single - excitons and biexcitons due to contribution to the initial state from dark states and basis states which allow to recombine only one electron - hole pair .",
    "irrespective of the initial number of excitons , ensembles of three qds allow to span only single - exciton subradiant states and thus block only single - excitons .",
    "it is important to emphasis that if the system was prepared in a bright biexcitonic state which leads to trapping of single - exciton occupation [ figs .",
    "[ fig : biex_fig](b ) and [ fig : biex_fig](c ) ] , then the pronounced oscillations due to coupling between the dots appear only in occupation of localized biexciton states , while the amplitudes of oscillations in the populations of single dots are negligible [ [ fig : biex_fig](c ) ] compared to single - exciton initial state [ fig .",
    "[ fig:3qd_comparison](d ) ] .",
    "this means that the biexciton initial state allows to achieve well defined stable single - exciton subradiant states , which is important for the application of quantum computation .",
    "the presence of optical collective effects in realistic qd systems requires high accuracy of a system parameters which may be controlled on the manufacturing stage or by external fields by , e.g. implementing the dots into the intrinsic region of a p - i - n junction .",
    "this structure provides a possibility of a separated injection of electrons and holes into qds from both sides of a sample and control of exciton dynamics and qd parameters through application of contacts on n- and p- type regions .",
    "it has been shown that controlled with a bias voltage carrier tunneling into a single qd in a p - i - n structure incorporated into a microcavity leads to regulated emission of single photons and pairs of photons.@xcite the ideas were followed by a technological realization of an electrically driven single - photon emitter with a layer of self - organized inas qds.@xcite the gate voltages constructed over dots allow to control energies of the dots and dipole moments , but the magnitudes of decay rates of single qds ( [ gamma ] ) depend on the average energy of the ensemble ( @xmath12 ) and thus operations on one dot change the decay rates of all qds in the system .",

    "have been modified such that the ensemble does not interact collectively with its photon environment ( see text ) . ]    in order to simulate this possibility we have calculated the time evolution of the system of four qds and we have changed the decay rates at some selected time points . the results are shown in in fig . [",
    "fig : pin ] where the system is initially in the `` collective regime '' and has been prepared in a single - exciton subradiant state .",
    "we assume that the control electric fields are weak enough to exclude `` dissociated '' exciton states .",
    "as expected , initially the excitation is blocked in the system .    at time 2.5",
    "ns a change of parameters occurs which destabilizes the system and induces quenching of the excitation .",
    "the effect may be produced by a variation of the internal electric field in the p - i - n junction , which is simulated here by a change of the decay rates of each single dot , and shown by the red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pin ] .",
    "the decay rates have been changed as follows : @xmath173 in this case the quenching is relatively weak because of a small change in the ratio of the decay rates but the effect is visible . at time 7.5 ns the parameters of each dot are changed back and the system population is again stable .",
    "the decay may be enhanced by changing the orientation of the dipoles as shown by the blue dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pin ] .",
    "all dipoles are parallel in the regions i and iii , i.  e. all angles @xmath93 .",
    "but now , in addition to the previous variations of @xmath148 the angles are also modified in the regions ii : @xmath174 radians .",
    "the misalignment of the dipole moments creates thus a stronger decay .",
    "the initial conditions may be restored at any time which may result in the trapping of a desired fraction of the initial occupation .",
    "we have studied the optical collective effects due to interaction of multiple quantum dots built of three and four emitters with the radiative surrounding .",
    "ensembles of three and more emitters allow to span many subradiant states which facilitate preparation of the system in an optically inactive single - exciton states and for ensemble of four emitters also in the biexciton subspace .",
    "we specified the conditions which allow the superradiance phenomena to occur in coupled inhomogeneous systems with different fundamental transition energies and dipole moments ( and thus decay rates ) .",
    "we discussed the dynamics of single electron - hole pairs and biexcitons .",
    "although many features typical for identical atoms , such as spontaneous trapping of excitation , may also occur in inhomogeneous qds there are differences in the dynamics of these systems . in principle , coupling between the dots induces excitation transfer between the dots which together with a possibility to define many dark states in ensembles of three and more dots lead to oscillations in the occupation of single dots .",
    "the amplitudes of these oscillates may be considerably reduced if the system is prepared initially in an appropriate biexction state which allows for trapping of one electron - hole pair .",
    "we envision that the presented collective effects may be controlled if the ensemble of dots is placed in the intrinsic region of a p - i - n junction with contacts constructed over the dots which due to sufficiently weak electric fields allow to control the dynamics of excitons and thus collective effects .",

    "to express an arbitrary single - exciton state in terms of the superradiant state ( [ bright ] ) and a subradiant state ( [ dark ] ) we begin with a derivation of a formula for a localized state @xmath4 .",
    "the subradiant state which allows to cancel out all different from the state @xmath4 localized contributions to the superradiant state has a form @xmath175 and is orthogonal to the superradiant state for an arbitrarily chosen state @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the localized single - exciton states may be decomposed into a superposition of the superradiant ( [ bright ] ) and subradiant state defined in the formula ( [ subi ] ) according to the equation @xmath176 the above formula allows to define a sub- and superradiant component in every single - exciton state @xmath177 since there is only one superradiant state in any system of @xmath0 qds , the short - living contribution @xmath178 is proportional to the state ( [ bright ] ) with a weight factor @xmath179 , while the stable part @xmath180 is a combination of @xmath0 subradiant states ( [ subi ] ) , which as a sum of dark states remains optically inactive irrespective of a number of emitters .",
