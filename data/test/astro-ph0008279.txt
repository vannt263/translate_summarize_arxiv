    "observations of hard x  ray emission from atoll sources ( e.g. barret , mcclintock , & grindlay 1996 ; barret et al .",

    "_ rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ observations of hard x  ray emission from saxj1808.4@xmath23658 ( heindl & smith 1998 ) demonstrated that hard x  ray flux is also present in other types of low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "these observations refined the role of hard x  ray emission in distinguishing between neutron star and black hole binaries .",
    "scorpius x1 is a high luminosity lmxb z source , where the primary is a neutron star with a low magnetic field .",
    "the presence of a non  thermal component in sco x1 has been suggested ( e.g. , peterson & jacobson 1966 ; riegler , bolt , & serlemitsos 1970 ; agrawal et al .",
    "1971 ; haymes et al . 1972 ; duldig et al . 1983 ) and",
    "the absence of such a component has also been reported ( e.g. , lewin , clark , & smith 1967 ; buselli et al .",
    "1968 ; jain et al . 1973 ; johnson et al .",
    "in fact , high sensitivity searches have failed to detect such a component , placing strong upper limits on the non - thermal flux ( e.g. , greenhill et al .",
    "1979 ; rothschild et al .",
    "1980 ; soong & rothschild 1983 ) .",
    "more recently , however , strickman & barret ( 2000 ) have reported the presence of a hard x  ray tail in sco x1 using _ cgro_/osse .",
    "we used _ rxte _",
    "observations from the public database to search for hard x  ray tails in sco x1 spectra .",
    "sco x1 has been observed with",
    "_ several times , and our data sample ( 1997 april to 1999 july ) contains 185,672s of proportional counter array ( pca ) on  source time and more than 100ks of on  source live - time in the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) .",
    "we describe data selection and analysis in ",
    "[ data ] , results in  [ results ] , discuss the detection of a non - thermal component in  [ disc ] , and present our conclusions in  [ conc ] .",
    "in this work we used data from hexte to search for hard x  ray tails in sco x1 in the @xmath120220kev interval , and data from the pca to determine the z position of sco x1 in the color  color diagram .",
    "the pca ( jahoda et al . 1996 ) is a set of 5 identical xenon proportional counters covering the energy range 260kev with a total area of @xmath17000@xmath3 .",
    "the hexte ( rothschild et al . 1998 ) consists of two clusters of 4 nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation counters totaling @xmath11600@xmath3 of effective area in the 15250kev energy range .",
    "each cluster rocks between source and two background fields to measure the instrumental background in near real time .",
    "the pca background is estimated from particle rates and the known diffuse x  ray flux . the pca and hexte share a common 1@xmath4 full width at half maximum field of view .",
    "pertinent to this work , the hexte continuum sensitivity at 100kev , for @xmath15kseconds of live  time , is @xmath113mcrab ( 3@xmath5 , scaled to in - flight backgrounds from the predictions of gruber et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we selected those observations from the _ rxte _ public database ( as of 2000 april ) in which @xmath65000s of hexte total on  source time is available , in order to achieve good sensitivity at high energies .",
    "since some observations did not point directly at sco x1 ( in order to reduce the very high counting rate ) , we have also discarded observations for which _ rxte _ pointing offsets were larger than 0.01@xmath4 .",
    "these criteria resulted in selection of the 16 observations displayed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the resulting accumulated on  source hexte live  time is 104,238s .",
    "we performed our analysis using hexte archive histogram mode data , which are accumulated every 16s , have spectral information in 64 compressed channels , and are present for all observations , independent of selected science mode .",
    "the data analysis was performed using software from ftools 5.0 . for each observation",
    ", we divided the data into subsets according to position on the z diagram ( see below and table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we then accumulated individual source and background count histograms for hexte clusters a and b and added them to form a single hexte source and background histogram for each subset .",
    "response matrices for hexte a and b were generated and added ( with weights of 0.57 and 0.43 respectively , according to their effective areas ) .    in order to be confident that any high energy excesses were real , we tailored our data selection to optimize background subtraction .",
    "we verified that any remaining systematic errors as a result of our procedure were small and did not affect the results .",
    "we followed the standard practices extensively studied for hexte background subtraction by us and other workers ( rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ; macdonald 1999 ) .",
    "first , we selected only data taken more than 15minutes after satellite passage through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "this allows any short  lived radioactive species produced in the detector material to decay and ensures that the systematic error of our linearly interpolated background estimate is @xmath70.02% of the background .",
    "we verified this process by comparing  for each cluster  the spectra from the two separate background fields which are sampled alternately during observations . in each case , subtracting these spectra showed no excess emission , giving us confidence in the on  source background estimate .",
    "this also verified that there were no confusing sources in the background fields .",
    "we note , too , that none of the sco x1 spectra show evidence for the prominent instrumental background lines at @xmath130 , 70 , 160 and 190kev ( rothschild et al .",
    "1998 ) which we would expect to be apparent if there were over or under  subtracted backgrounds . even though there was no obvious sign of residual background features , we allowed the normalization of the background spectra to vary in our fitting procedure .",
    "as expected , the fitted adjustment to the background level was always @xmath71% .",
    "even with this added degree of freedom , the significance of the detected high energy tails remained essentially unchanged .",
    "this also verified that live - times were calculated accurately , as systematic errors in the exposure would lead to incorrect background subtraction .",
    "finally , at 100kev ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , the sco x1 hard flux is of the order of 0.02counts / s / kev , while the hexte background was typically 0.23counts / s / kev .",
    "thus , our measurements are at level of @xmath110% of the background .",
    "macdonald ( 1999 ) showed that our background subtraction method , even for very long integrations , is free of systematic errors at a level of @xmath10.05% of the background . a more detailed discussion of hexte background systematics is given in gruber et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we used the pca data in order to constrain the position of sco x1 in a color  color diagram .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath1 4ms ) lightcurves provided power spectra to characterize any quasi - periodic oscillations and/or continuum noise .",
    "low resolution ( 16s ) lightcurves were used to generate color ",
    "color diagrams .",
    "we defined soft color as the ratio of the counts in the ( 57)/(35)kev energy bands and hard color as the ratio ( 720)/(57)kev . for observations 5/6 , 1215 , 17/18 and 20/21 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) the source was moving between the normal and flaring branches .",
    "for those 5 dual ",
    "branch observations , we divided each into normal and flaring branch subsets .",
    "this then resulted in 21 subsets .",
    "we used xspec 11.0 to fit the 20220kev hexte spectra with a combination of a _ thermal _ component plus a _ hard _ component . to fit the thermal component we tested the following models : thermal comptonization ( e.g. lamb & sanford 1979 ) , blackbody , and thermal bremsstrahlung . the thermal bremsstrahlung model returned , in all of our subsets , the smallest @xmath8 , and it was utilized to represent the lower energy hexte flux .",
    "in the 5 subsets in which we detected the presence of a hard x  ray tail ( see next section ) , a simple power law model , as well as ones with a spectral break , were evaluated .",
    "we found that the simple power law model described the hard component well , and it was used to represent the higher energy hexte flux . in all 5 subsets with significant non  thermal flux , a high temperature thermal component did not provide an acceptable fit .",
    "we developed two criteria to determine the presence of a hard x  ray tail in a particular spectrum : 1 ) a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath95 in the 75220kev energy range , and 2 ) an f  test null significance for the addition of the hard component at a level of 10@xmath10 or less .",
    "we claim that we observed a hard x  ray tail * only * when both these criteria were fulfilled .",
    "we thus have 5 strong detections of non  thermal flux in sco x1 spectra , with the hard x  ray tail extending at least to 220kev .",
    "the spectral parameters derived for those subsets are shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "similarly we defined a strong non  detection when 1 ) the snr in the 75220kev is @xmath111 and 2 ) the f  test is at a level of @xmath610@xmath12 .",
    "we thus have 4 strong non  detections .",
    "we note that several subsets formally have very significant f  test values , but snr values @xmath115 .",
    "these typically result from deviations in the 3050kev range , possibly due to imperfect modeling of the thermal component .",
    "we can not conclude that these subsets have truly non  thermal emission , although this possibility is open .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show spectra both from one of our detections and one of our non  detections .",
    "the derived photon indices ( @xmath13 ) for the 5 subsets where the tail was observed spanned a wide range : from @xmath20.7 to 2.4 , which differs from the osse results which have an average of 2.5 ( strickman & barret 2000 ) .",
    "it is suggestive that the two hardest photon indices were obtained when the source was on the flaring branch , and the softest were on the horizontal branch , showing a possible correlation between the hardness of the spectrum and the mass accretion rate @xmath0 , which increases in the sequence hb@xmath14nb@xmath14fb ( e.g. , van der klis 1996 ) .",
    "we also note that both times the source was on the hb a hard x  ray tail was detected .",
    "the non  thermal 20200kev flux from the 5 detections varied by a factor of @xmath12.5 from 0.631.56@xmath1510@xmath16ergs@xmath17s@xmath18 ( see table[tab2 ] ) .",
    "upper limits to the 20200kev flux from the 4 strong non  detections were estimated using a photon index of 1 , the mean from the 5 detections . the one non ",
    "detection subset with equivalent sensitivity to the detection subsets has a 2@xmath5 upper limit to the 20200kev flux of 1.0@xmath1510@xmath19ergs@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "this implies at least an order of magnitude in overall variability in the non - thermal component in sco x1 .    in order to estimate the 220kev luminosity , @xmath20",
    ", we used a complex multicomponent model to heuristically fit the pca spectra .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the derived flux due to uncertainties in the proper spectral shape to be @xmath12% . using 2.8kpc as the distance to sco x1 ( bradshaw , fomalont , & geldzahler 1999 ) , @xmath20 ranges over 2.13.2@xmath1510@xmath21 ergs s@xmath18 for the 5 detection subsets .",
    "similarly , the range of the 20200 kev luminosities of the non  thermal component measurements is @xmath22@xmath235.915.0@xmath1510@xmath24ergss@xmath18 .",
    "thus the non  thermal component represents about 1% of the total flux from sco x1 .",
    "no correlation between the * presence * of the hard tail and the position of the source in the color  color diagram is indicated , i.e. , we have observed the hard x  ray tail in all three branches . in addition the hexte thermal component is not correlated with the presence of the hard x  ray tail , i.e. , the presence of the hard tail is indicated by neither the temperature nor flux of the hexte thermal component .",
    "from the lack of correlation between the presence of the hard tail and the position of the source in the color  color diagram source it would appear that the hard x  ray tail emission region is not associated with that part of the accretion disk which is believed to be responsible for the qpo behavior ( van der klis et al .",
    "these results also do not support a correlation between the presence of the hard tail and clustering in the color  color diagram , such as mentioned by strickman & barret ( 2000 ) .",
    "we also note that this behavior is different from gx17@xmath252 , in which a hard tail is correlated with the position in the z ( di salvo et al .",
    "frontera et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also reported the detection of a hard tail in another z source ( cyg x2 ) .",
    "nevertheless we must point out that the observed photon indices may be related to the position in the z diagram .",
    "the hardest observed photon indices are in the fb and the softest ones in the hb . from this point of view the production of hard x  ray photons",
    "may be correlated with the accretion rate at the inner part of the disk .",
    "motivated by the observation that sco x1 is a variable radio source ( e.g. , fender & hendry 2000 ) , we considered whether or not the hard x  ray emission could be explained in terms of synchrotron emission . while the measured photon indices are consistent with this idea for the hb and nb , the ones measured when the source was in the fb ( consistent with 0 ) are not , since it would require an inverted distribution of relativistic electrons .",
    "similarly , the hb and nb spectra could result from comptonization , but the fb power law indices are again too hard .    a difference between atoll sources and sco x1",
    "is also seen in the soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "the atoll source hard tails appear when the 220kev luminosity is relatively low , @xmath1110@xmath26ergss@xmath18 ; whereas the soft flux in sco x1 is essentially at the eddington limit ( @xmath110@xmath21ergs s@xmath18 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that some models used to explain the hard x  ray emission of atoll lmxbs ( e.g. mitsuda et al .",
    "1989 ; hanawa , 1990 ) are applicable in a low luminosity state up to @xmath120kev .",
    "this , however , is not the case of our observations . on the other hand ,",
    "sco x1 may be similar to some atoll sources in the luminosity of the power law component .",
    "the sco x1 power law luminosity in the 20200kev range is comparable to the weaker atoll source hard x - ray luminosities reported by barret , mcclintock , & grindlay ( 1996 ) .",
    "distinguishing neutron stars from black holes remains a key goal in high energy astrophysics .",
    "recently it has been argued ( barret et al . 2000 ) that the luminosities in the 120kev ( defined as l@xmath27 ) and 20200kev ( defined as l@xmath28 ) bands could be used to distinguish between black hole and low state neutron star systems displaying hard x  ray emission . in their argument , the critical luminosity , l@xmath29 = 1.5@xmath1510@xmath26ergss@xmath18 , is the dividing line between neutron star and black hole binaries with the neutron star systems emitting l@xmath28 @xmath1 l@xmath27 when l@xmath27 @xmath7 l@xmath29 .",
    "since sco x1 is emitting eddington  level soft fluxes , we can not test that idea . on the other hand",
    ", our observed l@xmath28 does not contradict the idea pointed out by barret et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that only black hole binaries can have both l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 above l@xmath29 , since our measured l@xmath28 is below the l@xmath29 value ( see table[tab1 ] ) .",
    "we have observed significant detections of a non  thermal component in sco x1 on 5 out of 21 occasions with hexte on - board _ rxte_. we also have found that the presence of the hard x  ray tail is not associated with a particular position in the color  color diagram , but that the photon indices , instead , may be correlated with the position on the z diagram , albeit with a very limited number of examples .",
    "we inferred that the non  thermal power law flux of the source varied by over an order of magnitude comparing our detections with the non  detections , and by a factor of @xmath13 in the 5 cases where the presence of the hard x  ray tail was strongly indicated .",
    "our observed 20200 kev luminosities are in agreement with only black hole binaries emitting hard x ",
