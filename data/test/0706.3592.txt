    "all ionic species are treated in all their physically realistic configurations .",
    "however , the number of relevant configurations in a plasma can be really huge , especially for high values of atomic number @xmath0 , and all of them can not be taken into account . indeed , requiring that each configuration has its own basis of one - electron wavefunctions and including configuration mixing leads to a high numerical cost .",
    "the superconfiguration method has been invented @xcite in order to overcome this problem in an approximate way and to provide more accurate results than average - atom models .",
    "this approach includes relaxation effects ( different basis of wavefunctions for the upper and lower states involved in a transition ) , and allows inclusion of configuration interaction between relativistic sub - configurations of a non - relativistic configuration @xcite .",
    "as a configuration is defined by shells occupied by an integer number of bound electrons , a superconfiguration ( sc ) is defined by supershells , which are groups of shells close in energy @xcite ( _ i.e. _ whose energies differ from less than @xmath1 ) .",

    "the ionic coupling parameter of the plasma is defined as the ratio of ionic coulomb potential energy and thermal kinetic energy    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the effective ( average ) charge of the plasma .",

    "bound electrons are treated quantum mechanically and free electrons within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation ( hybrid model ) .",
    "once their electronic structure has been calculated , scs of the same charge can be grouped into ions . at this stage ,",
    "the plasma can be considered as an ensemble of ions , containing bound electrons , and immersed in a free - electron gas .",
    "it was shown @xcite that , provided that ions of different charges have different volumes , the electronic pressure , calculated together with ionic volumes in a self - consistent way , must be equal for each ion .",
    "the improvement in thermodynamic consistency brought by the diversity of ionic volumes ( in other words the `` redefinition '' of ions ) encourage us to apply this approach to eos calculations .",
    "the purpose of the work presented in @xcite was to propose a method for the treatment of mixtures , and the issue of thermodynamic consistency was not addressed . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the expression of pressure , and especially on the proper form of the quantum virial theorem .",
    "it is shown that the universal form of the virial theorem for a quantum - statistical model ( _ i.e. _ a virial theorem that does not depend on the boundary conditions of the wavefunctions ) is different from the one proposed in @xcite , which relies in an intrinsic way on neumann or dirichlet conditions .",
    "moreover , we find that the pressure obtained from the generalized virial theorem presented here is equal to the stress - tensor formula proposed in @xcite and can be obtained by minimization of the free energy .",
    "such a formula can be also applied to free - electrons @xcite , but for a sake of simplicity we consider here the `` hybrid '' model , in which free electrons are treated semi - classically .",
    "the transformation of an electron state from being bound to being a part of the continuum is gradual @xcite .",
    "however , although the hybrid model provides an accurate description of strongly correlated plasmas , the confinement of an ion in a finite volume may still lead , in our model and when the matter density is sufficiently high , to unacceptable discontinuities in the thermodynamic functions when a bound level disappears ( pressure ionization ) . such discontinuities in thermodynamic functions are due to the fact that it is difficult to obtain a variational formulation of the problem .    our eos model relying on a self - consistent - field calculation of screened scs with tf free electrons and quantum bound electrons",
    "is explained in section [ sel ] .",
    "it is shown in section [ tow ] that boundary values of the wavefunctions play a crucial role in the continuity of pressure and in the expression of the virial theorem from which the pressure formula is derived . in the same section ,",
    "a condition is proposed which should make variational the ion - sphere model when bound electrons are treated quantum - mechanically and free electrons quasi - classically .",
    "its impact on the expression of electronic pressure within the sc approximation is discussed .",
    "blenski _ et al . _ @xcite have developed a model of matter based on a self - consistent - field ( scf ) calculation of scs .",
