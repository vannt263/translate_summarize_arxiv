    "recently , motivated by the lifshitz model in condensed matter physics , hoava proposed a power counting renormalizable theory for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory , denoted as hoava - lifshitz gravity , is believed to be the potential ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of general relativity ( gr ) . in the infrared ( ir ) limit ( setting the parameter @xmath1 in the action ) , it recovers gr .",
    "hoava - lifshitz gravity admits a lifshitz scale - invariance in time and space , exhibiting a broken lorentz symmetry at short scales , while at large distances higher derivative terms do not contribute , and the theory reduces to standard gr .",
    "since then various properties and characteristics of the hoava gravities have been extensively analyzed , ranging from formal developments @xcite , cosmology @xcite , dark energy @xcite and dark matter @xcite , spherically symmetric solutions @xcite , and its viability with observational constraints @xcite were also explored .",
    "although a generic vacuum of the theory is the anti - de sitter one , particular limits of the theory allow for the minkowski vacuum . in this limit",
    "post - newtonian coefficients coincide with those of pure gr .",
    "thus , the deviations from conventional gr can be tested only beyond the post - newtonian corrections , that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the stability of the einstein static universe in hoava - lifshitz gravity , with a ` soft ' violation of the detailed balance condition ( recently , the stability of the einstein static universe in hoava - lifshitz gravity satisfying the detailed balance condition was analyzed @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the respective term in the action which represents a ` soft ' violation of the ` detailed balance ' condition modifies the ir behavior .",
    "note that this ir modification term , with an arbitrary cosmological constant , represent the analogs of the standard schwarzschild(a)ds solutions , which were absent in the original hoava model .",
    "the analysis of the static einstein universe is motivated by the possibility that the universe might have started out in an asymptotically einstein static state , in the inflationary universe context @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the einstein cosmos has always been of great interest in various gravitational theories .    in gr for instance , generalizations with non - constant pressure",
    "have been analyzed in @xcite . in brane world models ,",
    "the einstein static universe was investigated in @xcite , while its generalization within einstein - cartan theory can be found in @xcite , and in loop quantum cosmology , we refer the reader to @xcite . in the context of @xmath2 modified theories of gravity ,",
    "the stability of the einstein static universe was also analyzed by considering homogeneous perturbations @xcite . by considering specific forms of @xmath2",
    ", the stability regions of the solutions were parameterized by a linear equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "contrary to classical gr , it was found that in @xmath2 gravity a stable einstein cosmos with a positive cosmological constant does indeed exist .",
    "thus , in principle , modifications in @xmath2 gravity stabilize solutions which are unstable in gr .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was found that only one class of @xmath2 theories admits an einstein static model , and that this class is neutrally stable with respect to vector and tensor perturbations for all equations of state on all scales .",
    "these results are apparently contradictory with those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , in a recent work , homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations in the einstein static solutions were analyzed @xcite , consequently reconciling both of the above works . in the context of modified theories of gravity ,",
    "the stability of the einstein static universe in @xmath3 gauss - bonnet modified gravity was also analyzed @xcite .",
    "in particular , by considering a generic form of @xmath3 , the stability regions of the einstein static universe were parameterized by the linear equation of state and the second derivative @xmath4 of the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "it was shown that stable modes for all equation of state parameters @xmath5 exist , if the parameters of the theory are chosen appropriately .",
    "thus , the results show that perturbation theory of modified theories of gravity present a richer stability / instability structure than in gr .",
    "thus , it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the stability of the einstein static universe by considering linear homogeneous perturbations in hoava - lifshitz gravity . indeed",
    ", this analysis is particularly important as the higher derivative terms in the action contributes with a @xmath6 term in the modified friedman equations .",
    "this contribution becomes dominant for small @xmath7 , and as mentioned above motivates this analysis , due to the possibility that the universe might have started out in an asymptotically einstein static state , in the inflationary universe context @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological solutions of gr are recovered at large scales .",
    "it is shown that a large class of einstein static universes exist that are stable with respect to linear homogeneous perturbations .",
    "this paper is outlined in the following manner : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we briefly review the action and field equations of hoava gravity , and the respective modified friedman equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we consider linear homogeneous perturbations in the context of the einstein static universe in hoava gravity , and analyze the respective stability regions . in sec .",

    "the analytic continuation @xmath38 for the ds case , i.e. , @xmath39 , is considered @xcite , and the upper ( lower ) sign denotes the ads ( ds ) case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the higher derivative term appearing in the action ( [ haction ] ) contributes with a @xmath6 term , and only exists for @xmath40 .",
    "this term dominates for low values of @xmath7 , and the general relativistic cosmological solutions are recovered for large scales .",
    "for the einstein static universe , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the ricci scalar becomes @xmath43 , ( note that for @xmath44 , gr is obtained in the ir limit ) .",
