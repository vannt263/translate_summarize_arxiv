    "bose condensation is an important physical phenomenon observed nowadays not only in the superfluidity of liquid helium but also in the condensation of inert gases @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", the critical dynamics near such a phase transition can be described using model f. this model was analyzed in @xcite using the renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "it was shown that in the critical region , model f is equivalent to model e ( according to the standard terminology introduced in @xcite )    both dynamical models e and f of critical dynamics are free from hydrodynamic modes because velocity field turns out to be infrared ( ir ) irrelevant in the critical range .",
    "therefore , the critical exponent ( e.g. for the viscosity ) is still unknown , although the viscosity vanishes during the considered phase transition and manifests the features of order parameter .",
    "moreover , the problem of the influence of turbulence on the phase transition into the superfluid state remains unsolved .",
    "a stochastic equation for the critical dynamics of a bose system in the presence of a random velocity field was proposed in @xcite .",
    "such a modification of model e leads to some deviations from the standard field - theoretical approach , and we adopt it .",
    "we here continue the investigation begun in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study different scaling regimes of the proposed model .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin by analyzing the field theory formulation of the model and its renormalization ( see sec .",

    "we present some interesting details of the one - loop calculation and give relations between renormalization constants . in sec . 4",
    ", we analyze the fixed points and their regions of ir stability and give the results of the one - loop calculations of the rg functions . in sec . 5 , we present brief conclusions .",

    "the parameter @xmath1 measures the deviation from the kolmogorov regime , i.e. the value @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) corresponds to the inclusion of equilibrium fluctuations of velocity , and @xmath17 defines the regime of developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "we note that eq.([eq2 ] ) is the stochastic navier - stokes equation with added terms ensuring the existence of an equilibrium statistical limit for the proposed model .",
    "an important physical fact is that only the noise @xmath18 determines which specific hydrodynamic regime is realized .",

    "the connection with statics is violated ( because the form of the correlator @xmath18 changes ) .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that the multiplicative renormalization can be recovered by adding one new charge at interaction @xmath31 , i.e. , its bare action is related to the renormalized action by the usual multiplicative relations for the fields and parameters : @xmath32 the model is logarithmic for @xmath33 and the uv divergences are manifested in the form of poles in various linear combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in dimensional regularization , which is very convenient for practical calculation@xcite .",
    "these divergences are eliminated by introducing the renormalization constants .",

    "scheme only uv divergent terms are subtracted from the feynman diagrams , and we use this scheme in our calculations .",

    "the rg invariance @xcite can be expressed by the differential equation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes either the connected or the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green function and the differential part of the rg operator is defined as @xmath51 the differentiation is performed at fixed value of the bare parameters , which is indicated by the subscript `` 0 '' .",
    "the first summation is over the whole set of charges @xmath52 , and second is over the set @xmath53 .",
    "the rg functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are given by @xmath56    the explicit form of the beta functions follows from this definition and relations ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "it is useful to rescale the coupling constants as @xmath57 it can be seen from the perturbation expansion that the `` real '' coupling constants are the quadratic forms @xmath58 and @xmath59 and not simply @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whence comes the square root for @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( [ res_char ] ) .",
    "this fact is also manifested in the fixed - point coordinates because there we expect that @xmath62 and hence @xmath63 ( the same applies also for the charge @xmath61 ) . using the definitions ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ diffoper ] ) , we can write @xmath64 functions ( [ rgfun ] ) in the forms @xmath65 to calculate the renormalization constants in the ms scheme @xcite , we must the uv - divergent terms ( poles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 in our case ) from the feynman graph expansion of the corresponding 1pi functions for the given term in action ( [ s ] ) .",

    "scaling regimes are associated with fixed points of the corresponding rg functions .",
    "the fixed points are defined as such points @xmath86 at which all @xmath64 functions vanish simultaneously @xmath87 the type of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix of its first derivatives @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the full set of @xmath64 functions and @xmath90 is the full set of charges @xmath91 .",

    "but because the structure of the @xmath81-functions is cumbersome , we have not yet found the coordinates of this fixed point and its region of stability . of course , from other fixed points , we know where to expect such a stability region .",
    "in the near future , we hope to confirm our expectations by direct numerical calculations .",
    "we have studied model e was studied in the vicinity of the critical point of the phase transition from the normal to the superfluid phase with both critical and velocity fluctuations taken into account .",
