    "the low - mass microquasar gx 339 - 4 was discovered in 1972 by the satellite oso7 ( markert , canizares & clark 1973 ) . since then",
    ", it has been extensively observed at all wavelengths from radio to x - rays , and detected in all the canonical spectral states of x - ray binaries .",
    "little is known , however , about the remaining characteristics of the binary system .    based on modulations in the optical photometry , callanan et al .",
    "( 1992 ) inferred an orbital period of 14.8 hs , later confirmed by buxton & vennes ( 2003 ) using optical spectroscopy .",
    "further optical spectroscopic measurements and analysis of long - term x - ray light curves showed no evidence of this modulation , revealing instead a periodicity of @xmath01.75 days ( hynes et al .",
    "2003 ; levine & corbet 2006 ) .",
    "the first estimates of the distance to gx 339 - 4 placed the system at @xmath1 kpc , see zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and references therein .",
    "this result was later revised by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who concluded that the minimum distance lay in the range @xmath2 kpc @xmath3 kpc .",
    "they favoured a location in the galactic bulge at @xmath4 kpc .",
    "however , a study of absorption lines performed by hynes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggests that a location in the far side of the galaxy at a distance @xmath5 kpc can not be completely ruled out .",
    "the emission in the optical band is dominated by the accretion flow ( imamura et al .",
    "1990 ) , preventing direct observation of the secondary star even when the system is going through the very low x - ray luminosity state .",
    "the first detection of the star was made by hynes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) during the x - ray outburst observed in 2002 .",
    "the mass and spectral type of the donor star have not been firmly established yet . according to hynes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , an orbital period of @xmath01.7 days implies a low density for the companion of @xmath6 g @xmath7 .",
    "this probably corresponds to a low - mass subgiant of spectral type g or f , depending on the assumed distance .",
    "following this idea , muoz - darias , casares & martnez - pais ( 2008 ) suggested that the star is a `` stripped - giant '' , in which mass loss is due to the burning of an hydrogen shell . in this model , the mass of the secondary must be in the range @xmath8 . from this result , the authors constrained the mass of the compact object to be @xmath9 or even @xmath10 , for a mass of the secondary near the lower or upper limit , respectively .",
    "these values strongly support the idea that the compact object is a black hole ( see also hynes et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "gx 339 - 4 has been observed in radio , infrared , optical and x - ray wavelengths , sometimes simultaneously or quasi  simultaneously ( hannikainen et al . 1998 ; wilms et al .",
    "1999 ; nowak , wilms & dove 2002 ; homan et al .",
    "the source goes through all the spectral states of x - ray binaries : low - hard , high - soft , very high state , intermediate state and quiescence ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .",
    "it frequently displays outbursts associated with state transitions , episodes during which the x - ray luminosity can reach peaks of @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 for an assumed distance of 6 kpc ( homan et al . 2005 ; yu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it was after the x - ray outburst of 2002 that gallo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) imaged for the first time a relativistic radio jet on @xmath13 au scales in the system ( see also corbel et al .",
    "the detection of the jet confirmed that gx 339 - 4 is a microquasar .",
    "the hard x - ray emission during the low - hard state of microquasars and black hole binaries is generally thought to have its origin in a hot corona that surrounds the black hole .",
    "the observed power - law spectrum is explained through compton up - scattering of accretion disc photons by hot electrons in the corona .",
    "some of these up - scattered photons in turn excite iron nuclei in the disc material , giving rise to the appearance of a k@xmath14 line at @xmath15 kev , superimposed on the power - law continuum ; for evidence supporting the presence of the fe k@xmath14 line in gx 339 - 4 , see for example dunn et al .",
    ". however , corbel et al . ( 2003 ) showed that in gx 339 - 4 the radio and x - ray fluxes are tightly correlated , @xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that the emission in both bands might have a common origin in synchrotron radiation produced by non - thermal electrons in the jet , and not in the corona ( corbel & fender 2002 ; corbel et al .",
    "this idea was explored by markoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and markoff , nowak & wilms ( 2005 ) , who applied a jet model to fit the observations .",
    "they showed that synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the base of a jet can explain both the radio and x - ray spectra and reproduce the observed correlation .",
    "this model , however , is purely leptonic : the contribution to the radiation output of relativistic protons in the jet is not taken into account .    in this work we present a lepto - hadronic model for the broadband electromagnetic spectrum of gx 339 - 4 . in our model , protons and electrons are accelerated up to relativistic energies .",
    "the hadronic radiative contribution extends well into the gamma - ray band , since typical maximum proton energies are much higher than those of electrons .",
    "we expect that our predictions can be tested in the near future with the data collected by instruments like the fermi gamma - ray satellite and by atmospheric cherenkov arrays like the high energy stereoscopic system ii ( hess ii ) .    along with electromagnetic radiation ,",
    "the creation of electron - positron pairs is a necessary result of relativistic particle interactions .",
    "they are injected , for example , through photon - photon annihilation and as a by - product of hadronic interactions .",
    "recently , measurements carried out with the integral spectrometer ( spi ) instrument of the integral satellite have allowed to complete a detailed map of an extended region of emission line at 511 kev in the galaxy ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "these observations confirm the diffuse ( rather than point - like ) distribution of the line , with bright emission around the galactic center ( flux @xmath17 @xmath18 s@xmath12 ) , and a clear , asymmetric ( toward negative longitude values ) disc component .",
    "the disc total flux is @xmath19 of the bulge flux .",
    "the disc emission is detected up to scales of @xmath20 from the galactic center .",
    "different types of positron sources have been suggested in the literature , including pulsars , the massive black hole at the galactic center , microquasars , nucleosynthesis events , and extended processes like cosmic ray nuclear reactions and dark matter decay .",
    "the fact that both bulge and disc emission are clear , seems to disfavour the latter two possibilities as the main positron sources .",
    "microquasars , in particular those with a low - mass donor star , seem to be a particularly appealing possibility , given the spatial correlation of the line emission with the overall distribution of low - mass x - ray binaries in the galaxy ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2008 ) and energetic arguments ( guessoum , jean , & prantzos 2006 ) .    up to the present ,",
    "none of the microquasar models available presents quantitative predictions of the positron production rate , although in romero & vila ( 2008 , 2009 ) the radiative output of positrons was taken into account .",
    "the recent findings described above makes it timely an exploration of the possibilities for electron - positron production in self - consistent models for microquasar jets . in the present paper",
    "we have devoted a section to estimate the positron production rate in systems like gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the basis of the model , describing in detail the hypothesis made about the geometry and energetics of the system .",
    "we also describe the calculation of the relativistic particle distributions ( for primary and secondary particles ) and the radiative processes . in section [ general results ] , we discuss the observational data sets and the constraints they impose on the model parameters . we also present the best - fitting spectral energy distributions obtained and analyse the results .",
    "our estimations for the positron production rate are described in section [ positrons ] . finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we summarise our results and we compare them with those of previous works .",
    "we close discussing the predictions for the very high - energy emission .",
    "the jet model applied here is based on the model developed in romero & vila ( 2008 ) .",
    "a sketch of the system is shown in figure [ jet - sketch ] .",
    "the jet is supposed to be conical , and launched at a distance @xmath21 from the compact object , where @xmath22 is the gravitational radius of the black hole . the initial radius of the jet is taken to be a fraction @xmath23 of the value of the injection distance , @xmath24 .",
    "following falcke & biermann ( 1995 ) , we relate the jet power to the eddington luminosity of the black hole as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 erg s@xmath12 . the factor @xmath27 accounts for the existence of a counterjet of equal power .",

    "this allows to estimate the value of the magnetic field @xmath35 by equipartition between the magnetic energy density and the total energy density ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the bulk velocity of the outflow . after the launching point",
    "the magnetic field decreases with the distance @xmath31 to the compact object as    @xmath38    with @xmath39 ( krolik 1999 ) .",
    "magnetic energy is then converted into bulk kinetic energy ( and a fraction of this is dissipated at shocks and converted into internal energy of relativistic particles , see below ) , in such a way that equipartition holds only at the base of the jet .",
    "a few remarks are in order here . in the region",
    "@xmath40 the outflow is a poynting - dominated flux , formed by a thermal plasma that accelerates as it gets energy from the ordered magnetic field .",
    "thermal electrons and ions in the `` pre - acceleration '' region move approximately with the jet bulk velocity and have an energy @xmath41 .",
    "the plasma is neutral , but almost all the bulk kinetic energy of the jet is carried by the ions .",
    "no significant electron synchrotron radiation is expected from this region . at @xmath42 shocks",
    "perturb the field , and a fraction of the energy associated with the bulk motion of the plasma is converted into internal energy of relativistic non - thermal particles",
    ". in this region synchrotron cooling becomes efficient , especially for electrons .",
    "this situation is different from the case of high - mass microquasars , where `` cold '' relativistic electrons can cool by inverse compton interactions with the stellar photon field .",
    "a similar scenario arises in binary systems formed by a pulsar and a luminous be star , such as psr b1259 - 63/ss2883 , see khangulyan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "most of the bulk kinetic energy of the jet is carried by a thermal plasma .",
    "if shock waves propagate through some region of the outflow , the suprathermal tail of the maxwellian particle distribution can be accelerated up to relativistic energies by diffusion across the shock front ( see , for instance , drury 1983 and references therein ) .",
    "the physical conditions for an efficient acceleration are not clear . for the plasma to be mechanically compressible and allow the formation of shocks",
    ", the magnetic energy density @xmath43 must be in sub - equipartition with the bulk kinetic energy density @xmath44 of the plasma ( see komissarov et al .",
    "2007 for a discussion on this topic ) .",
    "therefore , the acceleration region has to be located at a distance @xmath28 from the black hole such that    @xmath45    the kinetic energy density of the jet can be written as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the cold particle density , and @xmath48 is the relativistic kinetic energy of a proton that moves with the jet bulk velocity ,    @xmath49    the presence of shocks may not suffice to accelerate particles efficiently . according to gaisser ( 1990 ) , for diffusive shock acceleration to work , the ram pressure in the acceleration region must dominate over the magnetic pressure .",
    "this condition can be written as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the internal matter energy density . for a cold - proton - dominated jet",
    ", @xmath51 can be calculated as in bosch - ramon , romero & paredes ( 2006 ) ,    @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the jet mass flow ,    @xmath54    and @xmath55 is the classical kinetic energy of a thermal proton ,    @xmath56    the mean velocity of the particles was taken to be equal to the lateral expansion velocity of the jet , @xmath57 , that is of the order of the speed of sound in the plasma .",
    "condition ( [ sub - equipartition_2 ] ) is stronger than ( [ sub - equipartition ] ) , in the sense that if the former is fulfilled , so is the latter . in either case , the location of the innermost acceleration region can be determined demanding that the appropriate condition is satisfied ,    @xmath58    with @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that the jet is dynamically dominated by cold matter .",

    "( 2003 ) , if all model parameters except the jet power are kept frozen , the correlation index @xmath116 is given by    @xmath158    here @xmath159 is the spectral index of the x - ray region of the synchrotron spectrum @xmath160 , and @xmath161 that of the synchrotron radio flux @xmath162 .    in our model radio and x - ray emission is due to synchrotron radiation of electrons .",
    "we find a value of the radio spectral index @xmath163 , which corresponds to the optically thick part of the spectrum from a particle distribution with a low - energy cutoff .",
    "the value of the x - ray spectral index is @xmath164 , as expected for an injection function @xmath165 ( notice that electrons are then strongly cooled due to synchrotron losses ) .",
    "these values yield @xmath166 .",

    "2003 ) . ]",
    "simultaneously with the radio and x - ray observations of obs3 and obs5 , gx 339 - 4 was also detected at nir and optical wavelengths ( markoff et al .",
    "2003 ; homan et al .",
    "2005 ) . as in the case of the radio emission",
    ", the nir / optical flux also displays a strong correlation with the x - ray flux .    from an analysis of low - hard state data from the 2002 outburst of gx 339 - 4 ( same epoch as obs5 ) , homan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shown that the flux density in the nir _ h_-band and the @xmath168 kev bolometric x - ray flux correlate as @xmath169 , with @xmath170 .",
    "a similar correlation was found between the optical _ v_-band and _ i_-band flux densities and the integrated x - ray flux , with correlation indices @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "these correlations disappear when the source leaves the low - hard state .",
    "the _ h_-band emission , however , rises and decays faster than the optical during the state transition , while the slope between the _",
    "i _ and _ v _ bands remains constant . as suggested by homan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , this may indicate a different origin for the nir and optical emission during the low - hard state .",
    "the correlations between the radio / x - ray and nir / x - ray fluxes suggest that the emission in the three ranges must originate in the jet .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that the nir flux extrapolates back to the radio data ( see also corbel et al .",
    "direct or reprocessed emission from an accretion disc can be ruled out due to the shape of the nir / optical spectrum and the short decay time scales .",
    "furthermore , the nir and radio fluxes are quenched when the disc begins to contribute significantly to the x - ray emission .",
    "homan et al . ( 2005 ) conclude that the nir emission probably originates in the jet , and approximately coincides with the position of the break of the synchrotron spectrum",
    ". the optical flux may be due to thermal and/or non - thermal reprocessed radiation from the accretion disc or star , or from a region of the jet different from where the nir emission is produced .",
    "these ideas are supported by the recent results of coriat et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who presented an analysis of five years of observations of gx 339 - 4 ( from 2002 to 2007 , a period that comprises five outbursts ) .",
    "they found a strong ir / x - ray correlation over four decades in flux during the low - hard state .",
    "the correlation index , however , is not unique : a break appears at bolometric ( 3 - 100 kev ) x - ray fluxes @xmath173 erg s@xmath12 @xmath18 ( @xmath174 for @xmath175 and @xmath176 kpc ) .",
    "coriat et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argue that this break can be explained attributing the x - ray emission to ssc radiation from the jet ( see also nowak et al .",
    "2005 , where it is suggested that models more complex than a single jet synchrotron component maybe needed to explain the correlations ) .",
    "they find no clear evidence of a similar break in the _ v_-band / x - ray correlation , and suggest that the optical emission in the low - hard state is dominated by the outer part of the accretion disc , and not by the jet .",
    "this correlation is not peculiar of gx 339 - 4 , but it seems to be a signature of low - mass black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "russell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysed radio , nir , optical and x - ray data from 16 sources ( including extragalactic systems in the lmc ) .",
    "their results agree with those of homan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for gx 339 - 4 .",
    "they estimate that the jet contribution to the nir emission during the low - hard state is @xmath177 , but only @xmath178 to the _ i _ and _ v _ bands .",
    "figure [ seds4 ] shows the best fit models obtained for obs3 ( including the lowest energy point in the optical ) and obs5 . in the case of obs5 , the radio , nir , optical and x - ray data are reasonably well reproduced using a hard particle injection spectral index @xmath147 . in the case of obs3",
    ", the data at optical frequencies can not be accounted for with a single synchrotron component .",
    "however , using a softer particle injection spectral index @xmath179 , it is possible to obtain models models where the synchrotron turnover occurs in the optical .",
    "the rise in the spectrum at higher energies , however , can not be fitted .",
    "this emission must have a different origin , for example in an accretion disc ( markoff et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "due to @xmath119 annihilation in the total photon field of the emission region .",
    "absorption is negligible in all cases and does not modify the production spectrum . ]    in order to asses the effect of photon self - absorption by @xmath119 annihilation , we calculated the attenuation parameter @xmath180 in equation ( [ attenuated - luminosity ] ) . as it can be seen from figure [ attenuation ] ,",
    "internal attenuation is almost negligible due to the low photon density in the emission region .",
    "the production spectrum is not appreciably modified in any case , contrary to some models calculated by romero & vila ( 2008 ) .",
    "according to the results of figures [ seds1 ] , [ seds2 ] and [ seds4 ] , during the high luminosity low - hard state , gx 339 - 4 would be a source detectable by fermi in the energy range 100 mev - 10 gev . in this range",
    "the emission is due to electron synchrotron radiation and ssc .",
    "however , it will be far from being a bright source , possibly appearing with a significance of 5 - 6 @xmath181 after one year of exposure . at higher energies",
    ", the emission of hadronic origin will be harder to detect with the present instruments .",
    "for some models , the predicted luminosities at @xmath148 tev are above the sensitivity of hess for a point source at @xmath182 kpc through exposures of more than 50 hours .",
    "future instruments like the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will make it easier to obtain a firm detection .",
    "such a detection at high energies is crucial to evaluate the hadronic content of the jet . on the other hand ,",
    "when the source is in a low luminosity phase , according to the results in figure [ seds3 ] it would be undetectable at high energies with the present instruments .",
    "recently , an analysis of several years of data collected by the integral satellite led weidenspointner et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to suggest that the observed asymmetry in the distribution of the electron - positron annihilation line traces the distribution of hard low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galaxy .",
    "these authors discovered that the 511 kev line emission from the inner galactic disc is clearly asymmetric : the flux from the region of negative galactic longitudes is 1.8 times larger than that from the corresponding region of positive longitudes .",
    "the same type of asymmetry is observed in the spatial distribution of hard lmxbs , those that show appreciable emission above 20 kev .",
    "the authors argue that positrons escaping the injection region with an energy of @xmath148 mev will not diffuse more than @xmath183 pc before annihilating .",
    "this distance is short enough for the line emission to be still correlated with the large - scale distribution of the sources .",
    "weidenspointner et al . (",
    "2008 ) estimate that the positron production rate required to account for the observed flux is @xmath184 erg s@xmath12 .    to investigate this possibility",
    "we calculated the positron injection rate in our model . according to heinz ( 2008 ) ,",
    "the number of injected positrons per unit time can be roughly estimated as    @xmath185    in this expression @xmath186 is the total luminosity injected in pairs and @xmath187 is the mean lorentz factor of the positrons when they leave the source .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that positrons have almost completely cooled when they reach the end of the jet , and thus @xmath187 is of the order of the jet bulk lorentz factor , @xmath188 . in our case , the most relevant process of pair production is @xmath119 annihilation .",
    "the calculated positron injection rates are shown in table [ fit - parameters ] .",
    "for those models that correspond to the high x - ray luminosity states , @xmath189 is very near or even exceeds the necessary lower limit given by weidenspointner et al .",
    "there are about @xmath190 lmxb in the galaxy and , although not detected yet , possibly most of them produce jets . even if many of them are considerably less powerful than the jet in gx 339 - 4 , the added contributions might well account for the observed flux at 511 kev .",
    "our estimations show that the proposed association between lmxb and the annihilation line emission is indeed feasible at least in energetic terms . in this way , there may be no need to resort to other more exotic explanations , such as annihilation of dark matter .",
    "a more detailed discussion on this topic will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that , under certain general conditions , the model developed here is capable of explaining the observed radio and x - ray spectrum of the low - mass microquasar gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the parameter that mainly determines the characteristics of the obtained spectra is the magnetic field decay index @xmath146 .",
    "this parameter , in turn , depends on unknown factors as the geometry and turbulence level of the magnetic field in the inner jet .",
    "the best fits to the high luminosity 1997 and 1999 data are obtained in those cases where the acceleration / emission region is placed relatively far from the compact object and the jet apex , @xmath191 and @xmath192 cm ( models a and e , respectively ) . in both cases",
    "the value of the magnetic field is similar , @xmath193 g , although @xmath145 in model a and @xmath194 in model e. the slope of the x - ray spectrum was difficult to reproduce , even assuming a hard particle injection with spectral index @xmath147 .",
    "nevertheless , a harder particle injection could be achieved in principle through diffusive acceleration at relativistic shocks , see for example the works of stecker , baring & summerling ( 2007 ) and keshet & waxman ( 2005 ) . in any case , the high x - ray luminosities require a powerful jet with a large leptonic content .",
    "in fact , all the fits yield @xmath195 , what means that as much energy is given to the primary relativistic electrons as it is allowed by the constraints imposed .",
    "the hadronic contribution to the spectrum in cases a and e is undetectable with the present gamma - ray instruments . in the other models , synchrotron radiation of protons and secondary muons and pions , and at higher energies the contribution of @xmath95 interactions , could be detectable by fermi and hess ( and in the future by cta ) , respectively .    for the low - luminosity observations ( models g and h ) ,",
    "the best fits were obtained for low values of the acceleration efficiency and minimum particle energy .",
    "the required jet luminosity is now only @xmath196 .",
    "the predicted emission above @xmath183 mev is too faint to be detected with the present gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "we have also calculated fits to simultaneous radio , nir / optical and x - ray observations from 1999 and 2002 ( models i and j ) . for these sets of parameters ,",
    "the break in the synchrotron spectrum occurs approximately in the nir , and the lowest - energy data was reasonably fit .",
    "the rising shape of the spectrum at optical wavelengths , however , could not be reproduced .",
    "this component is likely to originate mostly outside the jet , probably in the accretion disc .    in all models ,",
    "the spectrum is essentially of leptonic origin . in this sense",
    ", the results do not differ from those of previous works like those of markoff et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "our model , however , besides making predictions for the emission in the very high - energy regime , introduces some refinements over the previous scenarios adopted for this source .",
    "the particle distributions are calculated self - consistently taken into account the effect of energy losses on the injection spectrum .",
    "we also calculate the radiation emitted by secondary particles produced in hadronic interactions , and that of the electron - positron pairs product of photon - photon annihilation .",
    "the importance of photon self - absorption is assessed as well , although it turns out not to be relevant since the emission region is in a zone of low radiation density .",
    "we have also shown that the pair injection rate is significant enough , if this kind of model is solid in general for low - mass microquasars , to account for the observed line emission at 511 kev , according to the lower limit given by weidenspointner et al .",
    "if the proposed association between hard low - mass x - ray binaries and the electron - positron annihilation line flux can be proved , other explanations such as annihilation of dark matter could result unnecessary .",
