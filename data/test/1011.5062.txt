    "over the last decades , efforts have been made to get a better understanding of non - gaussian time series in the time and frequency domains .",
    "in particular , time series whose marginal distributions exhibit power law behavior have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the need for such models arises from applications in areas as diverse as insurance , geophysics , finance and telecommunications .",
    "infinite fourth moments are not untypical for series of daily log - returns from exchange rates , stock indices , and other speculative prices , whereas infinite second moments can be observed in time series from insurance such as for windstorm , industrial fire and earthquake insurance @xcite .",
    "infinite first moments are typical for the marginal distribution of the magnitudes of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "infinite variances are observed for the sizes of teletraffic data in the world wide web @xcite ; see also the recent books @xcite .",
    "classical time series analysis deals with the second ( or higher ) order moment structure of a stationary sequence .",
    "heavy - tailed modeling requires , in addition , that one takes into account the interplay between the dependence structure and the tails of the series .",
    "an important task is to understand the classical statistical estimators and test procedures when big shocks to the underlying system are present . when the marginal distributions have infinite variance , the notions of autocovariance , autocorrelation and spectral distribution lose their meaning .",
    "however , various studies over the last twenty years have shown that the analysis of linear processes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with heavy - tailed i.i.d .",
    "_ innovations _ @xmath5 and constant coefficients @xmath6 is very similar to classical ( finite variance ) time series analysis , where notions such as autocovariances and spectral density are defined only in terms of the @xmath7 s and the innovation variance @xmath8 .",
    "most estimators and test statistics from classical time series analysis can be modified insofar that one considers self - normalized ( or studentized ) versions of them and for these versions , an asymptotic theory exists which parallels the classical theory with gaussian limit processes .",
    "in contrast to the latter theory , the limits involve infinite variance stable distributions and processes @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of classical ( finite variance ) time series analysis is to study the spectral properties of the linear process @xmath9 . in this context , the _ periodogram _",

    "more generally , weighted integrated periodograms based on the classes @xmath26 } g(x)\\dvt x \\in[0,\\curpi]\\}$ ] for suitable functions @xmath27 are used to estimate the spectral density or to perform various tests concerning the spectrum of the underlying stationary sequence @xcite .",
    "the weighted integrated periodogram is also the basis of one of the classical estimators for fitting arma and fractional arima models .",
    "this method goes back to early work by whittle @xcite . in this context , one considers the functional @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a class of spectral densities indexed by a parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the _ whittle estimator _",
    "@xmath32 of the true parameter @xmath33 is the minimizer of @xmath28 over @xmath34 .",
    "this estimation technique is one of the backbones of quasi - maximum likelihood estimation in parametric time series modeling .",
    "the whittle estimator is known to be asymptotically equivalent to the corresponding least - squares and gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood estimators @xcite .",
    "when proving the asymptotic normality and consistency of @xmath32 , one has to study the properties of the sequence @xmath35 which , again , can be considered as a weighted integrated periodogram indexed by a class of functions .",
    "the above examples have in common that one always considers a stochastic process @xmath36 for some class of functions . in all cases ,",
    "one is interested in the asymptotic behavior of the process @xmath37 , uniformly over the class @xmath38 .",
    "this is analogous to the case of the empirical distribution function indexed by classes of functions .",
    "general references in this context are the monographs @xcite . early on",
    ", this analogy was discovered by dahlhaus @xcite , who gave the uniform convergence theory for @xmath37 under entropy and exponential moment conditions .",
    "the almost sure and weak convergence theory under entropy and power moment conditions was given in @xcite . a recent survey of nonparametric statistical methods related to the empirical spectral distribution indexed by classes of functions is @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to develop an analogous weak convergence theory for heavy - tailed stationary processes .",

    "we intend to show how the classical ( finite variance ) tools and methods have to be modified in the infinite variance stable situation which can be considered as a boundary case of the classical one when some of the innovations assume extremely large values . by now , there exists quite a clear picture concerning the asymptotic theory of the sample autocovariances , the periodogram and its integrated versions when the innovation sequencein a linear process has infinite variance ; see @xcite , chapter 7 .",
    "in addition to the latter reference , goodness - of - fit tests for heavy - tailed processes ( corresponding to the class @xmath47 ) were considered for short- and long - memory linear processes @xcite , and whittle estimation for infinite variance arma and farima processes was also studied @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    ", we introduce some useful notation for the integrated periodogram .",
    "our main goal is to prove the weak convergence of the integrated periodograms indexed by suitable classes of functions .",

    "a glance at decomposition ( [ decom2 ] ) is enough to see that the convergence of the finite - dimensional distributions of @xmath61 is essentially determined by the weak limit behavior of the sample autocovariances @xmath65 .",
