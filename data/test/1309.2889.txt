    ", it should be possible to constrain @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the few percent level .",
    "the imaginary parts @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be constrained from lepton - top helicity angles in the semi - leptonic channel where a full reconstruction of the @xmath1 system is possible . using the same dataset limits of about 15 - 20% are possible .",
    "@xcite finds that constraints of 1% or below are possible with @xmath52 at 13  tev .",
    "here we detail some estimates toward the measurability of the sm forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "the increased center of mass energy , relative to lhc 7 and lhc 8 , increases the proportion of @xmath1 events that arise from ( symmetric ) gluon fusion , so the size of the signal decreases with increasing center of mass energy .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , the observability of the sm asymmetry at lhc 14 depends sensitively on the evolution of experimental systematic uncertainties , and we will discuss prospects and scenarios for their improvement .    already at lhc 7 ,",
    "measurements of the top forward - central asymmetry are systematically limited .",
    "current lhc measurements in the lepton@xmath53jets channel are done with the full 5 fb@xmath3 7 tev dataset .",

    "@xcite add in quadrature to a total systematic uncertainty comparable to that of cms result . without this marginalization procedure , the systematic uncertainty on the current measurements of @xmath0 is comparable to the size of the predicted sm effect @xcite , @xmath56 at lhc 7 .",

    "specifically , we use predictions for the quantity @xmath59 where @xmath60 looks at whether the reconstructed top or anti - top is more central according to lab - frame _ pseudo - rapidity_. cutting on either cm invariant mass or cm rapidity increases the proportion of @xmath61-@xmath62-initiated top pair events relative to gluon - initiated events , and thus enhances the signal .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : topkin - smasymmpred ] , however , that even after imposing kinematic cuts , the size of the signal at the 14 tev lhc is comparable to the systematic uncertainties on the current measurements . unlike at the 7 tev lhc , statistical uncertainties will not be limiting given current projections for the integrated luminosities to be achieved at 14 tev .",
    "[ fig : topkin - smasymmpred ]      the dominant contributions to the experimental systematics are collected in table  [ tab : afcsys ] .",
    "several systematic uncertainties arise from uncertainties associated with the nature of the measurement of the forward charge asymmetry , as well as assumptions in background and top quark modeling .",
    "each uncertainty is treated in its own way , but the common technique for @xmath0 is to compare a measurement using a baseline model with one where one of the inputs has been varied within its known error .",
    "systematic uncertainties taken into account in measurements of @xmath0 include those from detector effects ( such as jet energy scale / resolution , lepton energy scale / resolution , and pileup ) , modeling uncertainties ( such as mc generator and hadronization , mc - derived backgrounds , and pdf uncertainties ) , and uncertainties from measurement techniques ( such as unfolding ) .",
    "the leading two systematics in each measurement are either simulation modeling uncertainties or calibration uncertainties for leptons and jets",
    ". these uncertainties will not necessarily scale with integrated luminosity without improvements in technique .",
    "jet energy and lepton energy scale , which are derived from comparisons between data and monte carlo , could possibly be reduced in a larger dataset , though uncertainties are currently dominated by disagreement between monte carlo generators .",
    "moreover , any increased pileup will likely contribute to increasing the overall uncertainty .",
    "however , jet and lepton energy scale uncertainties are already small enough to allow a significant measurement of @xmath63 in the semi - leptonic channel if @xmath14 modeling uncertainties can be significantly reduced , at least by half .",
    "one approach to reducing the limiting modeling uncertainties has already been advanced by atlas in their most recent semi - leptonic measurement  @xcite .",
    "additionally , combining measurements across experiment and channel will further reduce uncorrelated uncertainties , allowing for reductions in the overall systematic uncertainty .",
    "given that systematic uncertainties on @xmath0 are already on the order of 0.01 , it is certainly reasonable to assume that a significant measurement of the sm forward charge asymmetry will be possible at lhc 14 , and will grow in significance for physics beyond the standard model which predicts an enhancement .",
    "however , it will largely be improvements in modeling techniques that will allow this , not increased integrated luminosity , and no further benefit is obtained at the hl - lhc .",
    ".measurements of @xmath0 using approximately 5 @xmath64 of 7 tev data at cms and atlas for both @xmath14 decay channels .",
    "the two largest systematics are shown along with their respective magnitudes .",
    "note that the dilepton measurement at atlas evaluates systematics separately for each lepton channel and combines them to reduce the overall systematic uncertainty ; the listed systematic uncertainties are for the electron - electron channel .",
    "the migration matrix uncertainty , as listed in the cms dilepton measurement , is due to the finite monte carlo statistics used in the response matrix of an unfolding technique.[tab : afcsys ] [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the large pseudorapidity coverage at lhcb allows differential charge asymmetry measurements to be made in the forward region . here on one hand the intrinsic size of the asymmetry is enhanced , and on the other hand , the dominant asymmetric background from @xmath65jet production is reduced .",
    "the study @xcite concludes that with enough ( expected integrated luminosity after ls1 is 50 fb@xmath3 ) integrated luminosity at 14 tev a measurement of the charge asymmetry in top quark production at the lhcb can be done .",
    "the high luminosity phase of the 14 tev lhc makes it possible to also measure the charge asymmetry in the dilepton decay channel . no degradation due to pile - up effects",
    "is anticipated , allowing unchanged trigger settings with respect to current 7 and 8 tev running conditions .",
    "measurements from lhcb are complementary to the measurements in the central region performed by atlas and cms and thus contribute to a deeper understanding of top quark production .",
    "a combination of lhcb results with those from atlas and cms would shed further light into the top charge asymmetry puzzle .",
    "we have presented an overview of the theoretical understanding of top quark pair production , presenting a unified study of uncertainties in top kinematic distributions and surveying prospects for and uncertainties in top spin correlations .",
    "lhc 14 has good prospects for resolving outstanding questions in boosted top production cross - sections and production asymmetries .",
    "good control of systematic uncertainties is necessary to decisively measure a sm - like top pair production asymmetry at lhc 14 , but other , less inclusive observables , such as the incline asymmetry of ref .",
