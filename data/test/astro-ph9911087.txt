    "in our computations we adopt an initial helium content @xmath1 . we consider the complete sets of reactions for the pp - chain and cno tri - cycle , and the most important alpha - capture reactions for heavy elements up to mg .",
    "nuclear rates are taken from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) .",
    "the nuclear network is implicitly solved for all the considered h- and he - burning reactions , and without any additional assumption for nuclear equilibria .",
    "overshooting from stellar cores is applied according to the bressan et al .",
    "( 1981 ) formalism .",
    "mass - loss from massive stars ( @xmath2 ) is described according to chiosi ( 1981 ) .",
    "stellar evolution is calculated throughout the nuclear h - burning phase up to the he - flash at the rgb tip for low - mass models , and throughout nuclear h- and he - burning phases up to the beginning of the tp - agb phase and carbon ignition for intermediate- and high - mass models , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_hrd ] presents the evolutionary tracks in the h - r diagram .",
    "the appearance of short - lived loops is caused by the ignition of the 3-@xmath3 reaction during core and/or shell h - burning , leading to the first activation of the cno - cycle . in the case of low - mass stars ( @xmath4 )",
    "a loop develops near the end of central h - burning ( @xmath5 ) , whereas for more massive stars ( @xmath6 ) a similar feature also occurs at the formation of the he - shell .",
    "as far as the critical stellar masses for non - degenerate nuclear ignition are concerned , we find that @xmath7 corresponds to the minimum initial mass for a star to avoid the he - flash , and @xmath8 the minimum initial mass for a star to avoid carbon deflagration .",
    "the first dredge - up is practically absent in all models . only for stars with @xmath9 a very small amount ( less than 0.003 @xmath0 ) of he is dredged - up to the surface .",
    "the second dredge - up is experienced by stars with @xmath10 , being quite efficient in models with @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that the surface composition is enriched almost only in he ( reaching @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath13 at increasing stellar mass ) and negligibly in cno elements ( @xmath14  @xmath15 in mass fraction ) .",
    "massive stars , with @xmath16 , do not show any trace of surface chemical pollution due to dredge - up episodes . only models calculated with mass - loss may expose nuclearly processed material to the surface . with the adopted prescription for mass - loss ,",
    "stellar winds are never able to strip off h - exhausted layers in models with @xmath17 . in these cases , at most , the h - burning shell is eaten up , with consequent surface enrichment in he and small amounts of cno . for more massive models with @xmath18 , wind stripping is able to reach the co - enriched region left by convective he - burning . in these cases ,",
    "the corresponding yields of c and o are considerable ( @xmath19  @xmath20 ) ."
