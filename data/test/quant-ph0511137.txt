    "elastic scattering from a point defect in a hard - walled , multimode quantum waveguide is a problem which has been the subject of experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite inquiry in both condensed matter and atomic physics . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem from an unconventional point of view , reducing it to the scattering of a single effective wavefunction off an array of images .",
    "our approach enables us to easily understand complex transport phenomena which have already been observed ( such as conductance dips ) , as well as predict other new ones .",
    "the problem of scattering from pointlike impurities in waveguides is a general one , and thus has physical applications in several fields .",
    "impurity scattering in quantum wires , and the resulting disorder effects on electron transport , have long been of interest in mesoscopic physics .",
    "specifically , the problem arises in the context of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) confined by quantum wire potentials ; the impurity can represent a defect in the wire .",
    "such quantum waveguides can be fabricated at low - temperature @xmath0 interfaces , and are of interest due to their potential role in high - frequency and quantum devices .",
    "as carbon nanotubes can behave as few - mode quantum waveguides,@xcite our results are relevant to transport in nanotubes with adsorbed impurities  of interest in the study of biosensors .",
    "the problem of scattering in confined geometries arises in atom waveguides as well , with potential implications for quantum computing and atom interferometry . in both cases",
    ", atoms must maintain coherence as they pass through the waveguide , and the goal is thus to minimize phenomena such as collisional phase shifts.@xcite finally , the wave phenomena arising in quantum waveguides are in direct mathematical correspondence with a number of wave phenomena in other systems : water waves resonantly trapped between an array of cylinders,@xcite large antenna arrays,@xcite and sound waves directed by `` bessel '' line arrays in acoustics . @xcite    motivated by the above applications , we examine low - energy scattering of noninteracting particles from impurities in an infinite two - dimensional quantum wire , with hard walls at @xmath1 and @xmath2 the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) contains a point impurity , which we model as an @xmath3 wave scatterer of effective radius @xmath4 .",
    "our method differs from previous treatments , such as the renormalized @xmath5 matrix method,@xcite in that we use an unconventional approach which combines the following three ideas :    1 .",
    "the method of images . 2 .",
    "the realization that a confined scatterer , like a free space scatterer , is a rank - one target .",
    "we can , therefore , combine the @xmath6 degenerate transverse modes into a basis in which only a single wavefunction scatters .",
    "3 .   that the effect of scattering from the waveguide walls is to renormalize this single scattering wavefunction , so that it takes on a new effective value at the scatterer location .    using the method of images allows us to explicitly understand how each reflection from the waveguide walls affects the conductance .",
    "the fact that the confined scatterer is a rank one target enables us to express the transport properties of the wire entirely in terms of the single scattering wavefunction .",
    "finally , the idea of renormalization allows us to fully explain the transport properties of the wire in terms of reflections of this single wavefunction from the waveguide walls .    in section",
    "[ sec : freespace ] , we review free space multiple scattering , anticipating phenomena which will appear in the wire .",
    "section [ sec : wire ] lays out a similar formalism for scattering in the waveguide . in section [ sec : results - and - discussion : ] , we present physical phenomena which we observed in our model , which we interpret in section [ sec : physical ] in terms of interference effects .",
    "we relegate mathematical details to appendices [ sec : diffraction]-[sec : kummer ] .",
    "in section [ sec : wire ] , we show that the lippmann - schwinger equation for scattering from a confined impurity resembles the free space lippmann - schwinger equation , with the exception that in the wire , a renormalized incoming wavefunction replaces the true one .",
    "surprisingly , even for a single confined scatterer , this renormalized wavefunction includes free space _",
    "multiple _ scattering effects .",
    "we thus begin by briefly reviewing free space scattering , emphasizing the three phenomena which will reappear in the lippmann - schwinger equation for a single scatterer in the waveguide .",

    "as noted , we henceforth use atomic units , where @xmath13 applying the @xmath5 matrix formalism,@xcite we characterize a single scatterer at @xmath14 by its @xmath5 matrix,@xmath15 where @xmath16 is a function of the wavenumber , @xmath17 we choose the functional form of @xmath16 to simulate the scatterer of interest , under the constraint that @xmath16 must satisfy the optical theorem    @xmath18    in this paper , we choose@xmath19 which represents a hard disk of scattering length @xmath4 .      consider a single scatterer at @xmath20 in our @xmath5 matrix representation , an incident wave @xmath21 scatters into a wavefunction @xmath11 according to the lippmann - schwinger equation@xmath22 where    @xmath23\\label{eq : freegreens}\\ ] ]    is the 2d free space advanced green s function",
    "satisfying    @xmath24    we shall henceforth assume we are using the advanced green s function and omit the superscript on the hankel function ; we shall also omit the implicit @xmath25 dependence in the green s function .",
    "any incoming wave @xmath21 must be a solution to the free space schrodinger equation .",
    "we can therefore express @xmath21 in the basis of `` cylinder harmonics , '' @xmath26 where @xmath27 correspond to @xmath3,@xmath28@xmath29 waves .",
    "an @xmath3 wave scatterer in free space is a rank one perturbation : of all the terms in ( [ eq : freespaceswf ] ) , only the @xmath30 term is nonzero at the scatterer . from ( [ eq : lippmannschwingersingle ] ) , then , only the @xmath3 wave scatters , acquiring a phase shift ; remaining higher partial waves pass through the scatterer unperturbed . while trivial in free space",
    ", these facts will reappear more subtly in the wire .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation describing scattering from a collection of @xmath6 identical point scatterers at @xmath31 is@xmath32 in which we express the @xmath33 recursively as@xmath34 where we have followed foldy s method.@xcite comparing ( [ eq : lippmannschwingermultiple1]-[eq : lippmannschwingermultiple2 ] ) with the single - scatterer version ( [ eq : lippmannschwingersingle ] ) , the @xmath33 are the @xmath35 incoming wavefunctions at each scatterer : @xmath33 is the amplitude incident on the @xmath10 scatterer after scattering from each of the other scatterers .",
    "a crucial point is that @xmath33 excludes the singular self - interaction of the @xmath36 scatterer .",
    "defining @xmath37 @xmath38 inverting ( [ eq : lippmannschwingermultiple1]-[eq : lippmannschwingermultiple2 ] ) yields@xmath39 where@xmath40 excludes the singular term .",
    "an alternate expression of ( [ eq : lippmannschwingermatrix ] ) is as the born series@xmath41\\vec{\\phi}.\\label{eq : expansion}\\ ] ] the effective wavefunctions thus have a simple interpretation in terms of interfering paths : the terms in square brackets describe amplitude incident at @xmath14 after interactions with zero , one , two , or three other scatterers respectively .",
    "the series continues infinitely .",
    "anticipating phenomena that will reappear in the wire , we highlight the following points of this section :    1 .   the effect of multiple scattering is to create a new effective incoming wavefunction at each scatterer.[enu : newwf ] 2 .",
    "the effective wavefunction at a particular scatterer is a sum of waves scattered from all the _ other _ scatterers , and excludes the ( singular ) self - interaction of the scatterer.[enu : renorm ] 3 .",
    "an @xmath3 wave scatterer in free space is a rank one target.[enu : specialwf ]",
    "in this section , we examine how confinement in a wire affects the transport properties of a scatterer . applying the method of images ,",
    "we derive a form of the empty wire green s function . using this form of the green s function ,",
    "we show that the sole effect of confinement is to renormalize the incoming wavefunction .",
    "the image representation allows us to very simply calculate the renormalization coefficient .",
    "we define an effective cross section for a confined scatterer , and relate it to the conductance of the wire - impurity system .",
    "we derive an effective optical theorem in the wire .",
    "finally , applying this formalism , we investigate the behavior of the cross section and conductance as functions of various parameters .      in order to write down the lippmann - schwinger equation for an impurity in the wire",
    ", we require the green s function @xmath42 of the empty wire .",
    "the usual spectral form of the empty wire green s function is@xmath43 where the @xmath44 are the transverse modes for the particular waveguide ( see e.g. datta@xcite ) . in our hard wire ,",
    "the modes have the form @xmath45 we note that the spectral green s function ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) is a sum over evanescent modes as well as propagating ones .    although we could , in principle , proceed using the spectral form ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) of the green s function , the spectral green s function provides little physical insight into the precise mechanism of the scattering .",
    "we therefore take an alternative approach , and use the method of images to derive an alternate , equivalent form of ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) for the hard wire .",
    "although the problem of an impurity in a hard wire has been the subject of numerous theoretical studies,@xcite the authors are aware of only one work@xcite which applies the method of images : ref .",
    "3 treats the related problem of a point scatterer in a 3d waveguide of rectangular cross section , which the authors reduce to the problem of scattering from an impurity in a finite , 2d box .",
    "the method of images has the significant advantage of making multiple scattering effects explicit .",
    "we shall thus use the approach of ref .",
    "3 , rather than the more common spectral methods . because our problem of an infinite waveguide is somewhat simpler than the finite box treated in ref . 9 , the role of multiple scattering is more transparent .",
    "we are therefore able to explore in detail the considerable effect of multiple scattering on the physical properties of the wire , which , although briefly mentioned , is not examined in ref .",
    "3 .    the empty wire green s function @xmath42 satisfies green s equation inside the wire , and is zero on the wire walls :    @xmath46    the confined green s function differs from the free space version due to the necessity of including reflections off the walls when describing the response to a point excitation . note the factor of two in ( [ eq : greenwire ] ) , obtained by casting ( [ eq : greens ] ) in atomic units .    as in electrostatics",
    ", we can linearly combine free space green s functions ( [ eq : freegreens ] ) with point sources in different places , so that the linear combination satisfies ( [ eq : wirebc ] ) . as long as only one of the point sources is inside the wire @xmath47 , our sum will satisfy ( [ eq : greenwire ] ) inside the wire . outside the wire",
    ", we discard the solution .",
    "if the point source is located at @xmath48 , we use the configuration of image point sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : offcenter ] .",
    "we reflect the scatterer , creating a series of images such that the position of the @xmath49 image is @xmath50\\hat{y}.$ ]    this image configuration yields an empty wire green s function of the form @xmath51 the green s function ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) satisfies ( [ eq : greenwire ] ) inside the wire , and ( [ eq : wirebc ] ) on the wire boundaries . outside the wire we implicitly set the green s function to zero .",
    "the green s function satisfies the dirichlet boundary conditions because , as we take infinitely many images , the alternating sum of hankel functions converges to zero on the walls .",
    "this series converges extremely slowly , precluding its use for numerical purposes ( see the discussion in morse and feshbach@xcite ) .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation requires knowledge of both the green s function and the incoming wavefunction . in section [ sub : single - scatterer ] , we calculated the green s function for the wire . in this section , we discuss the incident wavefunction .",
    "we show that the effects of confinement resemble free space multiple scattering : confinement renormalizes the effective wavefunction at the scatterer from its true value . in the image formalism , the multiple scattering arises due to scattering off images .    applying the free space multiple scattering formalism ( [ eq : lippmannschwingermultiple1],[eq : lippmannschwingermultiple2 ] ) to the array of images in fig .",
    "[ fig : offcenter ] , we find that the lippmann - schwinger equation for the wire is@xmath52 where@xmath53 recall from our discussion of free space multiple scattering the physical meaning of this recursive lippmann - schwinger equation : the @xmath33 defined in ( [ eq : wavelets1 ] ) are the effective incoming wavefunctions at the @xmath36 scatterer in the array . in a general multiple scattering problem",
    ", we would have to stop here and solve numerically .",
    "the image array is , however , a special case : not only is it periodic , but the boundary conditions at the wall impose the antisymmetry@xmath54 any wavefunction , incident or scatterered , must be zero on the walls .",
    "thus , inside the wire , in the @xmath55 direction , the wavefunction is a superposition of modes ( [ eq : wiremodes ] ) . replacing the wire with an image array",
    "requires that we extend these modes outside the wire , into the region @xmath56 keeping the @xmath44 continuous at the walls , we can extend them so that the wavefunction is either symmetric or antisymmetric across the wire walls ; either set forms a basis .",
    "however , we know that in the absence of a wall @xmath57 must be continuous also , as we have eliminated the hard walls",
    ". the symmetric extension does not satisfy this condition .",
    "we therefore discard the symmetric extension , leaving ( [ eq : as ] ) as the proper boundary condition .    combining ( [ eq : wavelets1 ] ) and ( [ eq : as ] ) , the equation for the wavelets thus becomes@xmath58\\label{eq : wavelets}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the renormalization sum@xmath59 noting that@xmath60    taking @xmath61 in ( [ eq : wavelets ] ) , we find @xmath62 substituting ( [ eq : as],[eq : zerowavelet ] ) into ( [ eq : ms ] ) yields the lippmann - schwinger equation for scattering from an impurity in a wire:@xmath63\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}(-1)^{i}g_{0}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}_{i})\\label{eq : mswf}\\\\   & = & \\phi(\\vec{r})+s\\left[\\frac{\\phi(\\vec{r}_{0})}{1-sg_{r}}\\right]g_{w}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}_{0}).\\label{eq : mswf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing ( [ eq : mswf2 ] ) to the free space lippmann - schwinger equation ( [ eq : lippmannschwingersingle ] ) for a single scatterer , we see that the wire simply renormalizes the incoming wavefunction at the scatterer to have a new effective value @xmath64 and so our final lippmann - schwinger equation is@xmath65 for convenience , we define a renormalization factor@xmath66 which is the ratio between the original and renormalized incoming wavefunctions at the scatterer .    in order to cast the renormalized incoming wavefunction in terms of interfering paths , we expand perturbatively , as we did in ( [ eq : expansion ] ) for free space . for shorthand , define@xmath67 we find@xmath68\\phi(\\vec{r}_{0})\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left[1+\\mathop{\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}}_{i\\neq0}sg_{i\\rightarrow0}\\right.\\label{eq : bouncesfeynman}\\\\   &   & \\left.+\\mathop{\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}}_{i\\neq j}\\mathop{\\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty}}_{j\\neq0}sg_{i\\rightarrow j}\\times sg_{j\\rightarrow0}\\right]\\phi(\\vec{r}_{0})\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ eq : signstrength ] ) . the @xmath69 term of the sum ( [ eq : bouncesfeynman ] ) describes propagation to @xmath70 after scattering from any @xmath71 images , beginning with the first term , which describes free propagation to @xmath70 .",
    "alternately , the @xmath69 term corresponds to @xmath72 scattering events combined with any number of reflections off the wall , each of which introduces an additional phase of -1 .",
    "[ fig : born ] illustrates the correspondence between scattering from an image and reflecting from the wall .",
    "renormalization of the effective wavefunction is simply the manifestation of the identical phenomenon in free space ( see item [ enu : newwf ] in the list of section [ sub : freespacemultiple ] ) . from a semiclassical point of view ,",
    "the incoming wave , given infinite time to spread , reflects from each possible combination of scatterers before returning to the source .",
    "note that @xmath73 is simply the wire s green s function evaluated at the scatterer , with the singular self - interaction of the source removed,@xmath74.\\label{eq : gr}\\ ] ] this idea , as expressed in ( [ eq : gr ] ) , is the essence of `` renormalized @xmath5 matrix theory.''@xcite the theory , as applied to our case , is equivalent to the idea that in free space multiple scattering , the effective wavefunction at a scatterer excludes the singular self - interaction ( see item [ enu : renorm ] of section [ sub : freespacemultiple ] ) .",
    "we note that although we have derived ( [ eq : gr ] ) via images only for the special case of a hard walled guide , the result ( usually derived perturbatively ) is in fact true for an arbitrary guide or confining potential.@xcite      we have presented both the image series ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) and the spectral series ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) for the green s function . because the green s function of a system is unique , these two forms must be equivalent . however , the physical relationship between the method of images and the spectral form is far from obvious .",
    "the two forms of the green s function highlight different physical phenomena .",
    "for example , reflections from the walls , which appear immediately in ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) , are far less obvious in the spectral form ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) .",
    "contrastingly , the role of evanescent channels in the scattering , while straightforward in the spectral green s function ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) , is less transparent in the image expansion ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) of the same green s function ( although even the image expansion suggests that evanescent channels will be present in some form , because hankel functions are singular ) . in order to understand the connection between the image and spectral forms of the green s function , we show their equivalence mathematically in appendix [ sec : diffraction ] .    in appendix",
    "a , we use an integral form of the hankel function to show the equivalence of ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) and ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) .",
    "the physical connection between the image and spectral formalisms is diffraction .",
    "the images in fig .",
    "[ fig : offcenter ] form a periodic array , which is effectively a diffraction grating .",
    "we note one small difference from a typical diffraction situation : due to the wire boundary conditions , the incident modes are superpositions of two plane waves each , rather than a single incident plane wave .",
    "this difference is trivial , due to the linearity of schrodinger s equation .",
    "when such modes are incident on the effective lattice of images , they diffract : plane waves ( or superpositions of plane waves ) striking the grating scatter , at large distances , into sums of plane waves at the bragg angles . the diffracted spectral orders are evident as the quantized wavenumbers appearing in the spectral form of the green s function .",
    "as the green s function for each image scatterer is singular , evanescent waves appear in the fresnel regime , near the lattice .",
    "we examine these statements rigorously in appendix [ sec : diffraction ] .      while the method of images led quickly to the central results ( [ eq : mswf2],[eq : gr ] ) , these results expressed in terms of image sums converge so slowly as to be impractical for numerics .",
    "although the spectral form ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) converges more rapidly than the image series ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) , its convergence is still not uniform , as the evanescent modes include a logarithmic singularity .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : kummer ] , we use kummer s method to accelerate the convergence of the green s function , casting it in the form ( [ eq : limitform ] ) suitable for numerical work .",
    "a side benefit of applying kummer s method is that we obtain a more rapidly converging expression for @xmath73 : in appendix [ sec : kummer ] , we show that the series ( [ eq : lambda ] ) for @xmath73 ( which is a schlmilch series ) resums to@xmath75+\\frac{i}{2}-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\label{eq : schlomilchgreens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "we note that this expression is considerably more complex than the expression ( [ eq : lambda ] ) derived via the method of images . in the image formalism",
    ", the expression for the renormalization constant @xmath73 has the intuitive form ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , because removing the contribution of the source simply involves excluding the scatterer itself , while retaining the images . in the spectral formalism , because the singularity is not explicit , its removal is considerably less transparent .      in this subsection",
    "we define an effective cross section and optical theorem for the confined impurity . as we have shifted from the image formalism ( which applies only to the hard wire ) to the spectral one , where ( [ eq : dattagreenswire ] ) applies generally , the results presented in section [ sub : scattering - in - wire ] apply to arbitrary waveguides , not only hard wires .",
    "since the wire is infinite , for calculating transmission / reflection at infinity , we need consider only the open channels . without loss of generality ( due to translational invariance of the wire in the @xmath77 direction ) , suppose the scatterer is at @xmath78 with incident mode @xmath72 , normalized to unit flux , the wavefunction at large distances from the scatterer is@xmath79\\label{eq : larger}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which we can read off a scattering matrix@xmath80 where the reflection and transmission coefficients are@xmath81 one can show algebraically ( or verify numerically ) that @xmath82      in this section , we define an effective scattering cross section for the wire .",

    "with incident mode @xmath92 , the scattering wavefunction is@xmath93 which yields a probability current in the @xmath77 direction@xmath94 integrated over @xmath95 the cross terms cancel , and this current yields a scattered flux@xmath96 going in each direction . as our basis is normalized to unit flux , in our case ,",
    "the incident flux is simply 1 .",
    "we define a differential cross section for the @xmath69 incoming mode , similar to the free space differential cross section ( [ eq : freespxsec]):@xmath97 where we note the exact analogy between plane waves in our waveguide and partial waves in free space .",

    "the cross section of a spherically symmetric scatterer is independent of the direction of the incident plane wave . in the waveguide",
    ", however , the cross section depends on the incoming mode , because the waveguide breaks spherical symmetry .",
    "we can define a total cross section as the average over incoming directions,@xmath99 we note that @xmath100 represents a sort of fraction of the incoming wavefunctions which scatter .",
    "flux conservation imposes the bound@xmath101 the maximal value of @xmath100 will , therefore , be @xmath102 , and its minimal value will be 0 .",
    "we had previously mentioned that @xmath103 this reduced rank indicates that , as in free space , a basis exists in which a single wavefunction scatters , while the remaining @xmath104 do not .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 thus tells us the fraction of the flux of this scattering wavefunction , and should be between 0 and 1 .",
    "henceforth we will speak of @xmath106 as the cross section ( as a fraction of the wire width ) .",

    "the usual free space optical theorem involves the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "one can show that the free space optical theorem constrains @xmath3 via@xmath113 a similar relation holds in the wire , and as it turns out , flux conservation implies that not every value of @xmath114 is physically permissible .",
    "unitarity of @xmath115 implies that@xmath116 using ( [ eq : rmatrix]-[eq : trmatrix ] ) in ( [ eq : unitaritycondition ] ) , after some algebra , we find@xmath117 which requires that @xmath114 satisfy the constraint@xmath118 we can express ( [ eq : optical ] ) as an optical theorem , like the one in free space . define the `` forward scattering amplitude '' to be the amplitude which scatters in the direction of the incoming wave:@xmath119 with this definition , our `` optical theorem '' in the wire becomes@xmath120 which is very similar to the 2-d free space optical theorem , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the forward scattering amplitude .",

    "( [ eq : bouncesfeynman ] ) , the renormalized mirror wavefunction contains contributions that have propagated from each of the image scatterers .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of a cross section when a mode is about to open .",
    "the mirror wavefunction involves only open channels , and is thus discontinuous across a mode opening . using ( [ eq : swfplane ] )",

    "immediately after the mode opening , @xmath184 diverges as @xmath185 that is , the mirror wavefunction is always finite immediately before a nonzero mode opens , and diverges afterwards .",
    "the value of @xmath186 determines the width of the resonance ( and the lifetime of the corresponding quasibound state ) .",
    "however , while the limiting behavior of the mirror wavefunction influences the shape of the resonances , it does not fully describe their shape .",
    "as we discussed , the general structure of a resonance is that @xmath187 drops to zero just before the mode opens ; see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : xseccond ] .",

    "examining the right side of the resonance,@xmath192 under the assumption that @xmath193 an important point to note is that when @xmath194 as it does at a resonance , the free space properties of the scatterer have little effect on the cross section ( see for example ( [ eq : sigmaright1 ] ) ) , and so the structure of resonances is universal .      we would like to note , in passing , that the transparency of the scatterer at certain energies is reminiscent of the ramsauer - townsend effect in free space .",
    "in free space , we define the @xmath3 wave phase shift @xmath195 of an @xmath3 wave scatterer by@xmath196 let us define it in the confined scatterer as the phase shift of @xmath197 @xmath3 wave generated from the source and the images , when the incident wavefunction is our mirror @xmath3 wave:@xmath198 comparing to the form ( [ eq : mswf ] ) of the lippmann - schwinger equation , we find that@xmath199 applying ( [ eq : sigmaswf ] ) , we find that@xmath200 so that @xmath201 when @xmath202 and @xmath203 when @xmath204 as in the free space ramsauer townsend effect , the cross section vanishes when our analog of the @xmath3 wave phase shift does .    in conclusion , we can make the following general statements about the cross section :    1 .",
    "if @xmath205 the cross section will be discontinuous at @xmath206 the limit on the left hand side will be finite , and depend the value of @xmath207 the limit on the right hand side will be unity .",
    "2 .   the width and shape of the resonances in item ( 2 ) will depend on @xmath191 .",
    "physically this means that one can tune the resonances by sliding the scatterer up and down in the wire , or by changing the nature of the confining potential .",
    "having explored the structure of the resonances , we wish to understand them semiclassically , from an interference point of view .",
    "we again turn to the hard wire for insight into the scattering processes .",
    "the scattering cross section depends only on a single quantity , the renormalized mirror wavefunction .",
    "we have previously expressed this renormalized mirror wavefunction as a sum over the different paths ending on the scatterer ( [ eq : bouncesfeynman ] ) . when the interference between these paths is maximally constructive , the cross section is maximal .",
    "when it is maximally destructive , the cross section vanishes .",
    "in order to make this interference clearer , we shall make a simple approximation .",
    "consider the most straightforward case , with the scatterer in the center of the wire ( the case we examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : freespace ] ) .",
    "the image positions are @xmath208 in the green s function ( [ eq : wiregreens ] ) , we replace each hankel function by its asymptotic form , which is equivalent to making a semiclassical approximation .",
    "this yields an approximate green s function@xmath209 the contribution from each image carries a phase related to the path length from the image to the observation point , as well as a maslov index @xmath210 describing the sign change after @xmath72 reflections from the wire walls . in the limit that @xmath211",
    ", we see that the contribution propagating to the scatterer from the @xmath69 image has relative phase @xmath212 . for values of @xmath25",
    "such that@xmath213 all the scattered wavelets thus interfere constructively . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : freespace ] , we see that this constructive interference coincides precisely with the resonances which occur as new modes open .",
    "to fully explain the structure of the resonances , and understand the scatterer s transparency just before modes open , we would have to consider the effects of renormalization in this approximation .",
    "we shall not pursue the semiclassical limit further here , as we have already examined the exact case in great detail in section [ sub : universal - conductance - reduction ] .",
    "however , purely from this simple semiclassical argument , we can see that the resonances induced by the wire are indeed related to interference effects between different reflections .",
    "combining the method of images with the idea of a single scattering wavefunction , we have developed a formalism with which to treat scattering from a single impurity confined in a quantum guide .",
    "we find many similarities between scattering in the confined geometry and scattering in free space : we have defined meaningful analogs of the free space cross section , optical theorem , partial waves , and ramsauer - townsend effect .",
    "although the hard guide is particularly useful for insight , many of our results apply to other types of waveguides also .",
    "we have examined the transport properties of a confined scatterer , making several general observations about the existence , locations , and and characters of the resonances .",
    "additionally , we have outlined a method for approximating the cross section and conductance semiclassically , for arbitrary guides .",
    "we have derived an effective optical theorem for general quantum wire potentials .",
    "using the fact that a confined target is rank one , we have described the transport properties of the wire entirely in terms of a single scattering wavefunction , renormalized by reflections from the confining potential .",
    "our central result is that the cross section of a confined impurity is@xmath214 where @xmath215 is the renormalized single scattering wavefunction , which includes interference effects due to reflections from the waveguide walls .    despite the common use of the hard - walled guide as a theoretical model for 2deg",
    "quantum wires,@xcite actual confining potentials for both atom waveguides as well as 2deg quantum wires tend to be soft or even parabolic  whereas in nanotube quantum wires , the relevant boundary conditions are periodic ( the periodic boundary case is also exactly solvable via the method of images , although we have not presented the derivation here ) . while the hard wall itself is not the best model for 2degs , it is the ideal system in which to examine how effects like conductance reduction , which are independent of the confining potential and occur in more realistic geometries , arise from simple reflection and interference phenomena .",
    "the effects of multiple scattering from the impurity are in fact very similar for general confining potentials ( see e.g. the renormalized t matrix formalism@xcite ) .    a second limitation of this work includes the inadequacy of the @xmath3 wave scatterer model at high energies , and in particular at energies which are sometimes relevant when imaging electron flow .",
