    "the search for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking is at the top of the agenda for the next generation of collider experiments . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking predicts the existence of a single uncharged higgs boson whose mass is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "it is currently constrained to be @xmath2 at 95% confidence level @xcite , where the upper bound comes from precision electroweak measurements , while the lower bound is determined by direct searches .",
    "@xcite , and that for some range of parameters the neutral higgs boson of the mssm behaves like the higgs boson of the standard model @xcite . ]    at the tevatron collider there is the potential to look for the sm higgs boson using the decay mode @xmath3 @xcite . in the lowest order ( lo ) the most promising process is @xmath4 this search can cover the mass range up to about @xmath5 , once event samples , perhaps as large @xmath6 , have been accumulated .",
    "collection of data samples of this size will not be easy .",
    "however , the tevatron search is of great importance , especially because the mass range between @xmath7 is one of the most challenging regions for the lhc to look for the sm higgs @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we calculate the strong radiative corrections to the @xmath8 process @xmath9 which is the principal background for the associated higgs production ( [ wh ] ) at the tevatron .",
    "other non - negligible backgrounds , provided by the production of @xmath10 and other processes @xcite , will not be considered here .",
    "the calculation is performed in the limit where @xmath11-quark is massless , and our results indicate that the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the @xmath8 background are significant .    in section [ calc ]",
    "we briefly describe the calculation method based on the subtraction procedure @xcite , as formulated in @xcite .",
    "results for the nlo corrections to the lowest order processes ( [ wh ] ) and ( [ wbb ] ) at the tevatron are presented in section [ res ] , while conclusions are given in section [ conc ] .",
    "in order to evaluate the strong radiative corrections to processes ( [ wh ] ) and ( [ wbb ] ) we have to consider feynman diagrams describing real radiation , and also the ones involving virtual corrections to the tree level graphs .",
    "the corrections due to real radiation are dealt with using the general subtraction algorithm formulated by catani and seymour @xcite , which is based on the fact that the singular parts of the qcd matrix elements for real emission can be singled out in a process - independent manner . by exploiting this observation one can construct a set of counter - terms that cancel all non - integrable singularities appearing in real matrix elements .",
    "the nlo phase space integration can then be performed numerically in four dimensions .",
    "the counter - terms that were subtracted from the real matrix elements have to be added back and integrated analytically in @xmath12 dimensions over the phase space of the extra emitted parton , leading to poles in @xmath13 . after combining those poles with the ones coming from the virtual graphs",
    "all divergences cancel , so that one can safely perform the limit @xmath14 and carry out the remaining phase space integration numerically .    for the signal process ( [ wh ] )",
    "we consider only the effects of the initial state gluon emission .",
    "the final state radiation can be taken into account in the total rate by using the radiatively corrected branching ratio for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the virtual corrections to ( [ wh ] ) are of the drell - yan type and are well known @xcite .",
    "they are expressible as a multiple of the lowest order matrix element squared .    for the @xmath8 background process ( [ wbb ] )",
    "we consider real radiation from both initial and final state quarks .",
    "the virtual corrections to the tree level graphs can be obtained by crossing the one loop helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that our final results are presented in the @xmath17 renormalization and factorization scheme .",
    "however , in intermediate steps for the @xmath8 process we used the four dimensional helicity scheme of @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity , we performed the calculation in the limit where @xmath11-quark is considered massless , and with ckm matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 set to zero . in the case of @xmath8 background , the latter approximation eliminates the need to take into account scattering processes involving @xmath11-quarks in the initial state .",
    "given that , for example , @xmath20 , the effects of setting @xmath21 are small .",
    "corrections for the finite @xmath11-quark mass are expected to be of order @xmath22 , or about 1% for @xmath23 .    in order to ensure that we have a hard sub - process ,",
    "we have also introduced a set of basic cuts , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a scale of the same order as the @xmath11-quark mass .",
    "the first constraint imposes the correct physical threshold even though we have set the @xmath11 quark mass to zero .",
    "the constraint on the @xmath26 of the @xmath11 and @xmath27 quarks obviates the need for factorization subtractions involving the lowest order process @xmath28 .",
    "in general , more stringent cuts on all three quantities will be required for comparison with experimental data .",
    "all results given in this paper report on the rate obtained for @xmath29 production in @xmath30 collisions at @xmath31 . to include the contributions from @xmath32 production and the contributions from the @xmath33 decay into muons , one should multiply our results by a factor of four .",
    "note however that we assume perfect efficiency @xmath34 for detection of @xmath11-jets .",
    "achievable values of this efficiency would decrease our results by a factor of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we used the mrsr2 parton distribution functions with @xmath36 @xcite , while the scale @xmath25 from ( [ hard_process_cuts ] ) was set equal to @xmath37 .    in figure [ mu_nocuts ]",
    "we first show the scale dependence of the lo and nlo cross sections for the signal and background processes in a mass window @xmath38 , which is appropriate @xcite for a @xmath39 higgs boson .",
    "no other cuts apart from ( [ hard_process_cuts ] ) have been applied . at a _",
    "natural _ scale of @xmath40 we find that the k - factor is about 1.2 for the signal , but 1.5 for the background .    as already mentioned , more strict cuts than those of ( [ hard_process_cuts ] )",
    "have to be applied for comparison with experiment .",
    "in addition to the cuts on rapidity and transverse momentum , @xmath41 we also impose isolation cuts , @xmath42 as well as a cut on the scattering angle of the @xmath43 system @xcite ( the higgs scattering angle ) in the collins - soper frame @xcite , @xmath44 note that imposing the cut on @xmath45 requires knowledge of the longitudinal component of a neutrino momentum . by assuming that @xmath46 boson is on shell , and using @xmath47 and @xmath48 which are actually measured , this component can be reconstructed up to a two - fold ambiguity for a solution of a quadratic equation . due to the asymmetry of the neutrino rapidity distribution , by choosing the larger ( smaller ) solution for @xmath49 in the case of @xmath29 ( @xmath32 )",
    ", one can improve the probability of finding the correct @xmath46 momentum . following this prescription , in our lo ( nlo ) monte carlo studies with the above cuts we have observed efficiency of about @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) for processes ( [ wh ] ) and ( [ wbb ] ) , respectively . from the reconstructed @xmath46 momentum is higher . with cuts ( [ cuts1])-([cuts3 ] ) we found that about @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) of the lo ( nlo ) events for processes ( [ wh ] ) and ( [ wbb ] ) were correctly accepted or rejected . ]",
    "figures [ mbb ] , [ mu_cuts_100 ] and [ mu_cuts_120 ] show our results obtained after cuts ( [ cuts1])-([cuts3 ] ) have been imposed . in figure",
    "[ mbb ] we illustrate the @xmath57 mass dependence of the @xmath8 process in lo and nlo .",
    "the shape of this curve could be important in extrapolating the @xmath58 background from observed events with lower @xmath43 invariant mass .",
    "note however that the we have not yet clustered the @xmath11-partons with emitted radiation to form @xmath11-jets , although our numerical programs are flexible enough to allow that .",
    "this procedure could alter the shape of the @xmath43 mass spectrum .",
    "figures [ mu_cuts_100 ] and [ mu_cuts_120 ] show the scale dependence of the lo and nlo cross sections for @xmath38 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . at _ natural _",
    "scales we estimate a signal to @xmath8 background ratio of 0.43 and 0.30 at @xmath59 and @xmath61 , respectively . before",
    "definitive conclusions can be drawn on the tevatron search for the sm higgs boson other backgrounds need to be included .",
    "we have presented first results from a calculation of the radiative corrections to the production of @xmath43 in association with a @xmath46 . the corrections are observed to be large and positive at _ natural _ scales .",
    "the full implications of this for the search for the standard model higgs boson at the tevatron will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that sizable corrections have also been found in other reactions where the same virtual matrix elements have been used in a crossed channel @xcite .",
    "as yet we have no clear analytic understanding of why this should be so .",
    "our calculation can be considered the first step in the calculation of @xmath46 + 2 jet cross section .",
    "in addition , extension of our programs to other two boson processes should be straightforward .",
